    "after the discovery of high tc superconductivity in cuprate family @xcite in 1986 , efforts to synthesize new superconductors have continued and is gaining momentum .",
    "there are notable successes in these efforts , even though tc has not surpassed the limit @xmath2 134 k , set by a trilayer cuprate at ambient pressure .",
    "it is interesting that in most of the newly discovered low and high tc superconductors there are strong signals for electron - electron coulomb interaction based mechanisms for superconductivity . in this",
    "background experimental observations of superconductivity in doped band insulators hfncl , wo@xmath0 , diamond , bi@xmath1se@xmath0 families , sto / lao interface , gate doped srtio@xmath0 , mos@xmath1 @xcite etc . have come as a surprise .",
    "the 2 family of band insulators with low density of doped careers , discovered in 2012 by mizuguchi and collaborators @xcite belongs to this category . even at optimal tc @xmath5 11",

    "electron - phonon interactions should suffice to explain the observed low tc . however , various experiments seem to point that something different is going on .    with an ultimate aim to provide a general theory of unusual superconductivity in a class of doped band insulators",
    "@xcite , we focuss on a representative 2 family in the present article . key result of the present article is that unscreened short range coulomb interactions among doped carriers in this low career density system and orbital degeneracy destabilize free fermi sea and form charge -2e valence bonds organized as generalized wigner crystals .",
    "we explicitly demonstrate this instability for an interacting model hamiltonian for , built on a 2 orbital model @xcite of usui , suzuki and kuroki ( usk model ) .",

    "wigner crystals , originally discussed for fermi sea in a jellium background @xcite , contain ordered lattice of spatially localized electrons .",

    "@xcite , if we keep only the largest diagonal hopping term , t @xmath5 0.88 and ignore the rest , rigid band filling scenario becomes simple .",
    "free part of the hamiltonian in this case describes a collection of disconnected tight binding electronic chains running along the two diagonal directions @xcite .",

    "t@xmath18 , the interchain hopping parameters , modify dispersion relations , resulting in a well discussed topological change in fermi surface shape as one goes through a van hove singularity as x is increased from 0.0 to 0.5 .",
    "it should be pointed out that topological phase transition generated by the weak interchain hopping occur only at small fermi energies , where a significant modification of the fermi sea , from the strong unscreened coulomb interactions , is expected .",
    "two of the largest coulomb interaction parameters , which have been considered by other authors as well @xcite , will play important role in our theory .",
    "they are the onsite hubbard u and nearest neighbor repulsion v. we approximate the inter and intra orbital two electron repulsion at a given site by a single u @xmath2 2 ev .",
    "similary we assume a single v @xmath2 1 ev , for two electron repulsion between nearest neighbor sites , independent of the orbitals they occupy .    another important off - diagonal two body coulomb term represented by j@xmath21 0.25 ev , rotates a diagonal spin singlet pair ( figure 5 ) in an elementary bi plaquette , by an angle @xmath22 .",
    "an inter orbital hund coupling at a given bi site can be ignored , as proabability of such occupancies are very low in our low carrier density systems .",
    "larger value of u and v has been suggested in the literature .",
    "we find that even with our conservative values of u and v , rich physics emerge .",
    "having gotten an idea about the electronic structure we will move on to a summary of the puzzling phenomenology .",
    "it guides us to build a model and suggest physics beyond rigid band filling .",
    "in this section we briefly summarise experimental results and point out certain puzzling aspects .",
    "we begin with arpes @xcite . for low doping , one sees small fermi pockets , as predicted by theory .",
    "however the pockets do not close and resemble fermi arcs seen in underdoped high tc superconductors .",
    "further some experiments find that volume of the fermi pockets do not agree with doping density x , indicating a possible failure of luttinger theorem .",
    "quasi particle width , as given by arpes are very broad , with widths comparable to underdoped cuprates .    a recent arpes study @xcite brings out orbital poarization content in different parts of the bz .",
    "this has been interpreted to mean that underlying bloch states of the fermi sea have different orbital content , due to a strong 1d character of the band .",
    "we suggest that this data is not inconsisent with real space domains containing ordered doped mott - hubbard electronic chains ( domains of generalized wigner crystal ) .",
    "this interpretation has some support from stm results that we will see shortly .",
    "arpes also sees @xcite , as doping is changed , an indication for change in fermi surface topology , as in a rigid band filling scenario . however , spectral functions are very broad .",
    "we interpret the seen topology change as an interesting , but residual feature of a strongly affected reference fermi sea , rather than signal for a fermi liquid .",
    "similar situation arises in cuprates , where even in the mott insulator and lightly doped mott insulator one sees residual features of a strongly affected non interacting fermi surface .",
    "fermi liquid , as we know in metals for example , has a sharp feature with quasi particle width vanishing as t@xmath17 at low temperatures .",
    "electron - phonon interaction , important in these low carrier density material , could explain the broad spectral features through polaronic effect .",
    "however it is difficult to explain other features , as in the case of cuprates .    in a soft xray photo emission study @xcite a strong supporession of the fermi edge",
    "is seen in a 2 family member .",
    "the authors bring out an interesting similirity of this suppression to that seen in strongly correlated systems such as cuprates .",
    "stm studies @xcite for different family members exist . a recent observation @xcite of strong local orbital ordering and checker board pattern of such local orders is very interesting .",
    "caution has been made that this could be a surface effect , rather than a bulk phenomenon .",
    "however , such a behavior in the bulk , is consistent with our generalized wigner crystallization supported array of doped mott - hubbard chains and/or ordered plaquette valence bond resonances .",
    "giant superconducting fluctuations , resembling pseudo gap of cuprates have been also reported . in one of the stm studies",
    "@xcite , what is believed to be a superconducting gap does not close well above tc , reminescent of underdoped cuprates . a large variation in the superconducting gaps seen @xcitein one experiment is also reminescent of underdoped cuprates .",
    "it is also noteworthy that a large value @xmath23 seen in some experiments @xcite is significantly different from weak coupling bcs expectations .",
    "tunneling asymetry has been argued to be an important consequence of an underlying mott character in doped mott insulating system @xcite .",
    "the work reported in reference @xcite , clearly shows a marked tunneling asymetry .",
    "we interpret this as signal for presence of self organized doped mott insulator character .",
    "neutron scattering results @xcite show presence of strong local structural ( pyramid ) distortions .",
    "the results remind one of large octahedral rotations and local distortions in cuo@xmath1 planes seen in single layer cuprate material such as lsco or 2201 bisco , where the superconducting tc is considerbly low .",
    "these local distortion or rotations help charge localization and favor competing orders such as charge stripes , spin stripes etc .",
    ", at the expense of superconducting order @xcite .    in one of the 2 family members , a signal for cdw transition @xcite around 250 k is reported .",
    "it will be interesting to see if this is connected to our proposal of generalized wigner crystallization that supports superconducting rvb states at low temperatures .    controlled study @xcite has been performed in sr@xmath24la@xmath8fbis@xmath1 as a function of doping x. there is a good indication of a first order insulator to superconductor , as a function of x. in our opinion this points out that charges in the insulating phase ( below the critical x ) are organized in special ways ( cooper pair wigner crystals or self trapped valence bonds from a strong electron - phonon interactions ) that enable a first order transition to a superconducting state .",
    "detailed stm and arpes study in these systems are required .",
    "hydrostatic pressure and uniaxial pressure experiments @xcite also show first order phase transition , between two superconducting states having different tc s .",
    "we suggest that they represent transition between two different self organized rvb phases supported by different patterns of generalized wigner crystallization .",
    "optical conductivity @xcite in one of the 2 systems exhibit an upper hubbard band like maxima centered around 1.5 ev .",
    "this interesting feature , according to our interpretation to be discussed later , provides an evidence for presence of strong bi - s - bi valence bonds in the ground state .",
    "with this background in mind we will discuss our model and show that coulomb interaction can organize conduction electrons in special ways and give rise to an electron correlation based superconductivity .",
    "in this section we start with the 2 band model of usk and show that even a conservative value of coulomb interaction parameters encourage orbital order and modifies physics in an interesting way .",
    "the commensurate doping x = 0.5 , in offers us a convenient place to illustrate importance of coulomb interactions and our generalization wigner crystallization of charge -2e valence bonds .",
    "first we estimate the total energy per site in the rigid band fllled scenario .",
    "then we construct few rvb states with lower energies .",
    "we consider the many chain hamiltonian h@xmath25 for a single bi square lattice .",
    "it contains two parts : x and y chain hopping terms and onsite and nearest and neighboring coulomb interactions u and v. to begin with we ignore interchain hopping terms t@xmath18 , t and t@xmath18 , as they are small compared to the largest t. their important effects will be studied latter .",
    "the many chain model hamiltonian is : h_c & = & -t_ij;x;nnn c^_i x c^_j x -t_ij;y;nnn c^_iy c^_jy + + & + & _ i n_i^2 + v _ ij ; nn n_i n_j , where @xmath26 is the total number of electrons at site i. the summation ` nn ' ` nnn ' stands for nearest neighbor and next nearest neighbor ( diagonal ) hopping respectively",
    ". we will construct few variational wave functions and compute their energy exactly for the many chain model hamiltonian h@xmath25 ( equation 3 ) .",
    "this will help us to show an instability of the uniform free fermi sea . at the filling x = 0.5 under consideration ,",
    "mean number of electron added per site is .",
    "so every x and y chain is _",
    "@xmath27-th filled _ for each spin species ( figure 2 ) .",
    "this uniform state has full orbital and lattice symmetry .",
    "filled bands for commensurate filling x = 0.5 in .",
    "this uniform state , obtained in a rigid band filling picture , is a shallow fermi sea , scaledwidth=30.0% ]    band width of the 1d chains is 4t. kinetic energy per site , counting contributions from two types of chains and two spin species is : ke_0 = 2 2 ^_- k dk - t hartree energy of this uncorrelated state can be estimated in the presence of coulomb repulsions u and v. a given bi site , containing two orbitals can have a total 16 many electron states = 1 ( empty ) + 4 ( one electron + 6 ( two electron ) + 4 ( three electron ) + 1 ( completely filled 4 electron ) states .",
    "probability of finding a 2 electrons at a given site for the filling x = 0.5 is @xmath28 . here",
    "the first term is the probability of finding two electrons in a single site and the second term is the number of two electron states .",
    "we ignore three and four electron states , which occur with lower propabilities , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "so energy cost from onsite repulsion is @xmath31 .",
    "similarly energy cost ( hartree energy ) per site from nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion from four neighbors is @xmath32 v @xmath33 . in the decoupled chain limit under consideration ,",
    "hartree - fock contribution from v term is zero .",
    "thus kinetic plus interaction energy per bi site for the fermi sea , with complete orbital symmetry , for x = 0.5 is e_0.5 -t + ( u + v ) -   0.2   ev inclusion of interchain and other hopping matrix elements do not produce appreciable correction to the variational energy .",
    "we observe that major energy increase in this low density system comes from the nearest neighbor repulsion v.    , arising from two fold orbital and two fold spin degeneracy at every occupied site .",
    "n is the number of bi atoms in the bis plane.,scaledwidth=25.0% ]    let us consider a classical electron crystal state , which avoids coulomb repulsion u and v completely ( for x = 0.5 ) , through single electron occupancy of one of the sublattices of bi square lattice and zero occupancy in the other ( figure 3 ) .",
    "this crystalline state of electrons is highly degenerate .",
    "the 4@xmath34 fold degeneracy arises from the two fold orbital and two fold spin degeneracy .",
    "we will remove degeneracy of the above classical ground state step by step , to see the emergence and importance of the diagonal bi - s - bi valence bond . in the first step we form charge -2e cooper pairs or valence bonds as shown in figure 4 .",
    "it is a wigner lattice of ordered and frozen diagonal valence bonds , where no two electrons are nearest neighbors .",
    "we calculate energy of a bi - s - bi diagonal valence bond ( charge -2e state ) using the ground state energy of a two site hubbard model ( hubbard dimer ) e_vb = - [ u^2 - 16t^2]^ + .",
    "this expression is very instructive .",
    "since ratio of band width 4t to u is small we expand @xmath35 in powers of @xmath36 and get @xmath37 .",
    "first term is the kinetic energy of two electrons occupying a bonding state .",
    "second term is the hartree term , coming from onsite repulsion u. third term is the important correlation energy gain , that arises through a supression of double occupancy in the exact solution of the hubbard dimer .",
    "this bonding between next nearest neighbor bi sites ( along diagonal bi - s - si direction ) avoids nearest neighbor repulsion v.        thus energy per bi site of the frozen charge -2e wigner crystal state is given by    e_vbc = e_vb - 0.3 ev    this energy is lower than the energy of the uniform shallow fermi sea state ( equation 5 ) , for our model hamiltonian ( equation 3 ) .",
    "_ this completes our proof for the instability of uniform fermi sea towards charge -2e cooper pair formation and wigner crystallization . _    in proving an instability we have used a key nearest neighbor repulsion energy parameter v @xmath2 1 ev .",
    "an accurate and microscopic evaluation of this parameter , relevant for low energy physics in 2 layers , as a function of doping x , in itself is a challenging manybody problem .",
    "our parameter v , in some senses encodes all ( non on - site ) short distance unscreened electron - electron coulomb repulsions .",
    "effective value of v for a given family member will depend on crystal and electronic structures , nature and dielectric properties of the reservoir layer etc .",
    "a large value of v we have assued is reasonable in an insulating state , such as a wigner crystal we have discussed .",
    "once the system gets metallized effective v will be modified .",
    "we believe that modifications at short distances will not be significant enough to alter our picture .",
    "our main message is that in a low carrier density fermi sea unscreened short range repulsions can not be ignored , an insight that wigner provided us back in 1934 . in tight binding models with orbital degeneracies",
    "unscreened coulomb interaction seems to be even more important and has a potential to provide a rich physics , through self organization of generalized wigner crystal , rvb states etc .",

    "energy gain from this plaquette resonance ( with d@xmath3 orbital symmetry , figure 5 ) per site is - @xmath41 . since overlap charges are localized to the neigborhood of sulfur atoms ,",

    "as we move away from x = 0.5 we loose commensurability and wigner crystal will quantum melt .",
    "cooper pairs will also delocalize and expand their sizes , to take advantage of single particle delocalization .",
    "however , we expect the nature of valence bond correlations to survive at short distances even after quantum melting .",

    "@xmath48 is the density of states at the reference uniform fermi sea .",
    "when @xmath49 is large j@xmath47 is approximated by the superexchange j @xmath50 .",
    "however , for the present case of intermediate @xmath49 , energy difference between the singlet ground state and excited triplet state of a hubbard dimer is a good measure of @xmath51^{\\frac{1}{2 } } - \\frac{u}{2 } \\sim 1~ev $ ]    this rough estimate gives us a maximum scale of tc in the range 20 to 100 k.    a good way to study ground state properties of superconductivity quantitatively is to use the following variational rvb wave function :    represents cooper pair function for a singlet valence bond electron pair at sites i and j. in terms of relative coordinates , amplitude @xmath52 is large within a plaquette for diagonal singlets .",
    "a coherent superposition of diagonal singlets , within a plaquette represents the _ plaquette valence bond resonance _ with d@xmath3 symmetry .",
    "the projection p@xmath45 prevents overlap or touching of resonating plaquettes .",
    "this takes care of the short range coulomb repulsion and inturn overlap of valence bonds .",
    "we defer study of the above variational wave function to a future publication and just point out that the short range repulsions in the bis lattice , orbital degeneracy and a favorable hopping path way has given us an opportunity to have stable charge -2e",
    "cooper pairs and a means to achieve superconductivity .",
    "in the next section we will see another nearly degenerate supercondducting state that can be obtained by creating quantum fluctuations in a charge -2e wigner crystal .",
    "the superconducting and normal state that we are going to construct is interesting in its own right and has some phenomenological support as we will see . to realize this variational state we allow electrons to delocalize along only x chains , using hopping t , as shown in figure 6 .",
    "this results in decoupled 1d chains , whose effective hamiltonian within this manifold of x - orbital occupancy are decoupled 1d hubbard x - chains . we start with a variational state denoted as ( ... , , 0 , , 0 , ... ) to indicate a collection of parallel chains in their ground state with a staggered occupancy of and 0 .",
    "as nearest neighbor occupancies are absent in this variational state , inspite of delocalization along the chains , nearest neighbor repulsion v term drops out in the energy estimate .",
    "and chains with a lower occupancy @xmath53 .",
    "energy of this state is lower than the uniform shallow fermi sea state of figure 2 .",
    "we view this 1d array as a wigner crystal of doped mott - hubbard chains.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    energy of the above state at half filling is obtained using exact solutions of lieb and wu @xcite :    e_h(u ) = -2 t _ 0^ d  , where j@xmath54 and j@xmath55 are bessel functions .",
    "this expression explicitly shows band narrowing effect or renormalization of hopping matrix element , as a function of u. for @xmath56 , relevant for our problem , band narrowing is about 40 percent .",
    "thus our interesting many body ground state has an energy per site :    e_c - 0.42 t - 0.3  ev .",
    "compared to the energy @xmath57 ev of free fermy gas with a full orbital and square lattice symmetry for the same value of x = 0.5 , our correlated manybody state has a lower energy of @xmath58 0.1 ev per site .",
    "we also find that we can reduce energy of the above state further ( figure 5 ) , by a staggered chain occupancy @xmath59 , where the variational parameter @xmath60 .",
    "this state is a self doped state , where mott insulating chains have transferred a fraction @xmath53 of electrons to empty chains .",
    "we will discuss optimal value of @xmath53 etc .",
    ", in a future publication , except to point out that for @xmath53 = 0.25 we have series of weakly coupled quarter filled bands , where only rotational symmetry is broken and lattice translation symmetry is preserved .    the above intrinsically anisotropic reference variational state allows us to construction anomalous normal states and superconducting states by making use of interchain hopping that we have ignored so far .",
    "mott insulating subsystes that we mostly encounter , for example in cuo or lamno@xmath0 are robust mott insulators .",
    "mott insulating 3d electrons are robust organizations through strong chemical bonding of various atoms and after removal of orbital degeneracies .",
    "they are supported by the underlying lattice and a set of atoms .    in our case of generalized wigner crystals , orbital selection and orbital order self",
    "organizes and supports doped mott insulating chains with reduced symmetries .",
    "doped mott - hubbard chain arrays breaks rotational and translational symmetry of the square lattice .",
    "there are 2@xmath612 = 4 possible chain orders : they are obtained by globally i ) replacing x chains by y chains and ii ) interchanging empty band chains and half filled band chains .",
    "this leads to 4 different types of domain formation and accompanying phase boundaries , which are topological defects . under suitable conditions these domains could order .",
    "domain formation can be encouraged by disorder , for example arising from positional disorder of f atoms in .    energy gain in our low carrier density system by formation of doped mott insulating state is small @xmath2 0.1 ev . the self organized mott chains can also disappear as a function of temperature , for entropic reasons .",
    "this will be a thermal melting of a generalized wigner crystalline state .",
    "we will sketch the mechanism of superconductivity in the weakly coupled doped mott insulating chain scenario and make an estimate of superconducting tc .",
    "mott insulating chains develop a strong local spin singlet pairing correlations , as we move away from half filling .",
    "this is known in theory , from lieb - wu solution and numerical studies . using the rvb theory for cuprates @xcite",
    ", we suggest that neutral spin singlet pairs in the mott - hubbard chains are pre - existing cooper pairs . in view of a finite mott - hubbard gap ,",
    "singlet spinon pairs present in the ground state are not capable of transporting charges and remain _ neutral_. doping makes room for a fraction of electron singlets to coherently delocalize and transport charge -2e .",
    "fraction of charges that are capable of transporting charge -2e , the superfluid fraction , is proportional to the variational parameter @xmath53 ( amount of self doping ) or doping , @xmath62 0.5 - x.    a doped mott - hubbard chain can not support true long range superconducting order , due to divergent 1d fluctuatuions .",
    "the interchain hopping can help in establishing a 2d kosterlitz thouless state .",
    "this is closely related to the interlayer pair tunneling @xcite and interchain pair tunneling @xcite mechanism of superconductivity , which we briefly describe below .",
    "a doped mott - hubbard chain , at low energies has spin - charge decoupling .",
    "it is described by luttinger liquid theory .",
    "coherent electron quasi particles are absent at the fermi surface .",
    "consequently interchain hopping matrix elements get renormalized to zero at low energies @xcite .",
    "it means that two conducting chains are effectively insulated and single electrons are confined within the chains .",
    "this is a many body effect , that was discussed in detail early in the context of interlayer pair tunneling mechanism in cuprates @xcite .",
    "however , if we consider a second order process , involving tunneling of pair of electrons , there can be coherent transport of a spin singlet charge 2e pair , using strong pairing correlations present in the individual chains .",
    "this coherent transport of charge 2e spin singlet pairs from chain to chain acts like a local josephson tunneling .",
    "what is important is that energy gain from josephson tunneling can i ) increase local superconducting correlation and ii ) establish kosterlitz - thouless superconductivity in 2 dimensions . in establishing",
    "a 2d superconductivity rvb superconducting correlations in the doped mott chains play a fundamental role .",
    "expression for tc for 2d superconductivity in interchain pair tunneling tunneling mechanism involves the pair tunneling matrix element @xmath63 :    k_bt_c ~ e^    here j@xmath47 is a mean energy required to break spin singlet pair and creat two electrons at the fermi level , for a short time scale , so that they can pair tunnel via a second order process involving interchain hopping matrix element t  etc .",
    "meaning of the bcs like dependence is similar to the one we discussed in section v ( following equation 9 ) , for the isotropic 2d superconductivity . substituting suitable numbers we get an estimate for maximum scale of tc in the range",
    "@xmath2 2 to 20 k. this scale of tc is much lower than the isotropic 2d state that we discussed in section v.    a well known place , where interchain pair tunneling seems to be at work , is in quasi 1d organic conductors @xcite .",
    "scale of interchain tunneling is typically 10 to 20 times lower .",
    "interchain pair tunnelling has been also suggested @xcite to be a mechanism for pairing , when weakly coupled charge stripes are present in underdoped cuprates .",
    "asymmetry in the tunneling conductance feature has been suggesed to be an important signal of an underlying mott character in doped mott insulating system @xcite .",
    "physically this asymmetry arises from differences in many electron reorganization , while adding or removing an electron in an stm experiment for example .",
    "the experimental work reported in reference @xcite , clearly shows a marked tunneling asymetry . in our theory , in mott - hubbard chain scenario as well as valence bond wigner crystal scenario , we have strongly correlated mott chain or hubbard dimer which could produce the required asymmetry @xcite in tunneling conductance",
    ".    it will be nice to repeat the tunneling measurement for various doping level and study the asymmetry .",
    "our expectation is that the asymmetry will be stronger at lower doping .",
    "a very neat upper hubbard band like feature is seen in optical conductivity around the energy 1.5 ev reported in @xcite .",
    "we suggest that this is a signal for the presence of bi - s - bi singlet pairs in the ground state .",
    "energy required to break a valence bond pair in our theory ( equation 6 ) is @xmath64 1.2 ev .",
    "inclusion of residual coulomb interactions within our scenario could account for the peak seen at an energy of 1.5 ev in optical conductivity .",
    "more experiments will be welcome .    in the pseudo gap phase of cuprates pairing correlations or pre - existing rvb",
    "singlet pairs survive well above tc .",
    "in such a situation electrical transport , their magnetic field dependence and properties such as nernst effect are dominated by cooper pairs present at the fermi level and population of thermal vortices in the 2d cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "anderson calls this phase as a vortex liquid @xcite . in another context ,",
    "namely superconductor to insulator transition in 2d , for example induced by changing disorder , an intermediate metallic state domonated by cooper pair like bose correlations has been suggested . this is called bose metal @xcite by das and doniach . in our opinion",
    "there is a close connection between bose metal and vortex liquid @xcite .",
    "the theory we have developed in this paper for 2 offers a new play ground to achieve the physics of bose metal and vortex liquid . in our model , pairing correlation arising from avoidance of next nearest neighbor repulsions , favors strong valence bond correlations with a large energy scale .",
    "this bosonic charge -2e correlation should survive in the normal state .",
    "our suggestion is that the normal state of 2 family of superconductors should be studied carefully from the view of bose metal and anomalous nernst effect .    in general",
    "the pseudogap features seen so for in various experiments should be investigated further to get deeper insight into the fascinating 2 family .",
    "what is novel in our work is the organization of a dilute fermi sea in a band insulator , into states containing certain diagonal valence bonds ( charge -2e cooper pairs ) .",
    "these states range from cooper pair wigner crystal to weakly coupled array of 1d mott - hubbard chains . the family of states we have suggested could support isotropic as well as anisotropic 2d kosterlitz - thouless superconductivity .",
    "it is likely both occur in different members of the 2 family for different range of parameters",
    ".    self organization we have suggested , interestingly , makes onsite coulomb repulsion important , while trying to avoid near neighbor coulomb repulsions .",
    "it is a delicate interplay between onsite interaction and residual long range coulomb interactions , that leads to doped mott physics and superconductivity .    in the cooper pair wigner crystal phase",
    "we have proposed , a disorder free is likely to be an insulator . in an ideal situation deviation away from x = 0.5 will act like a doping parameter .",
    "disorder could quantum melt and create superconductivity even for x = 0.5 .",
    "it will be interesting to see if the superconducting dome , currently observed around x = 0.5 , develops a dip around x = 0.5 in superconducting tc as a function of x , with decrease in disorder .",
    "diagonal valence bond singlets bi - s - bi play a fundamental role in our theory .",
    "topological defects in the generalized wigner crystal may contain a finite density of unpaired spins ( spinons ) through broken diagonal valence bonds .",
    "this may lead to low temperature curie contribution to spin susceptibility .    in the present paper we have only focussed on certain simple energy minimizing generalized wigner crystal states .",
    "a closer look suggests that a variety of ordering of diagonal singlets , with closeby energies are possible .",
    "one also expects glass like organization of the diagonal singlets for some range of parameters , leading to interesting electron pair glass or valence bond glass phases . as we indicated earlier , in the mott - hubbard chain scenario p - wave instability nematic metallic state etc .",
    "are interesting possibilities .",
    "self organized states we have presented in this paper could be easily affected by disorder and temperature .",
    "so we expect interesting phase transitions as a function of temperature and disorder . as there is a spontaneous translation and orientational symmetry breaking associated with the self organization interesting topological defects , induced charges are possible",
    ". to test our theory it will be interesting to look for signals for enhanced antiferromagnetic ( spin singlet ) correlations in neutron and nmr experiments .    electronic coupling between two bi - s layers in the 2 bilayers @xcite , in our theory , could play important role in stabilizing different generalized wigner crystals and their quantum melting properties .",
    "this needs to be investigated .",
    "instability towards the two phases we have talked about can also be justified using a weak coupling approach and a proper use of umklapp electron pair scattering .",
    "they help build mott localized spin singlet pairs @xcite .",
    "our self organized wigner crystal that supports doped mott hubbard chains or sheets is different from the stripes one sees in underdoped cuprates and other mott insulator based systems @xcite .",
    "we organize strongly correlated systems starting from a fermi sea in a doped band insulator . whereas stripe states in cuprates are reorganizations of an underlying mott insulator after doping .",
    "electron phonon interaction will play very important role for small value of x. it is likely to stabilize isolated or islands , or even ordered arrays of bi - s - bi diagonal valence bonds . in the superconducting state , where valence bonds are delocalized , it is likely to play less important role .",
    "we hope to presemt , in a future publication , a general theory of rvb states in doped band insulators from coulomb forces and apply to other systems @xcite , hfncl , wo@xmath0 , diamond , bi@xmath1se@xmath0 families , sto / lao interface , gate doped srtio@xmath0 , mos@xmath1 etc .",
    ", alluded to at the beginning .",
    "in this article we discussed the puzzling phenomenology of the 2 layered family of superconductors and have suggest that they point towards a mechanism of superconductivity that is based on electron - electron repulsion .",
    "our main point is that utilizing the two fold orbital degeneracy at the fermi level and unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsion , doped electrons get self organized into arrays of doped mott chains or a quantum liquid or isotropic 2d rvb staates .",
    "we have called them wigner crystal supported rvb states .",
    "superconductivity , within our theory , can be either isotropic 2d or anisotropic 2d kosterlitz - thouless state . in the isotropic ( melted wigner crystal )",
    "scenario order parameter symmetry is a gapful d@xmath3 symmetry ; in the anisotropic ( doped mott hubbard chain array ) scenario we have a gapful extended - s symmetry .",
    "we made an accurate estimate of energy of the vatiational state , using known exact results from lieb and wu for 1d repulsive hubbard model .",
    "rest of the conclusions , including a possible second phase containing plaquette bond resonances logically follow from this starting point .",
    "our work at the moment is semi quantitative and suggestive .",
    "it needs to be addressed more quantitatively .",
    "the novel scenario and a theory we have presented , that emphasizes _ importance of unscreened coulomb interactions in doped band insulators _ , is encouraging from the point of reaching higher superconducting tc s in this s - p , non transition metal based system .",
