    "from the early days of qcd , light meson spectroscopy played an important role in development of the theory and in understanding of its low energy structure .",
    "the flavour symmetry of qcd originates in part from the observed @xmath5 multiplet structure of the light pseudoscalar and vector mesons .",
    "more recently , scalar and tensor spectra have provided evidence for a possible over - population of the @xmath6 spectrum and for the existence of gluon - rich states .",
    "the possible existence of gluonic excitations is one of the most intriguing features of the meson spectroscopy .",
    "there is tantalizing evidence of exotic , hybrid mesons in the spectrum around @xmath7 [ 5 - 7 ] , and future experiments proposed for jlab and gsi in the light and charm sector respectively will map out the exotic spectrum .",
    "the glueball signature comes primarily from the analysis of the crystal barrel @xmath8 and wa102 central production data  @xcite .",
    "detailed mapping of various scalar meson decay channels led to the identification of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 states , all expected to contain significant gluon components .",
    "while the genuine qcd resonances in the scalar channel are not expected to occur below 1 gev , the low energy region can be studied using standard , low energy expansion techniques .",
    "these include the effective range expansion , @xmath12 and other methods based on analyticity coupled with truncation of the unitarity condition .",
    "the parameters of the soft meson - meson interactions _",
    "e.g. _ subtraction constants , form factors , coupling strengths , _ etc .",
    "_ effectively correspond to local potentials smeared over distance scales of the orders of @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ close to the pion root mean square radii .",
    "the strength of the interaction can be constrained from chiral symmetry or simply fitted to the data [ 8 - 11 ] . as a result one obtains a very good description of the spectrum including the resonance region .",
    "furthermore , the behavior of the scattering amplitude in the complex energy plane enables one to establish the existence of dynamical resonances such as the isoscalar @xmath14 and @xmath15 and the isovector @xmath16 mesons .",
    "the last two are particularly interesting as they are very sensitive to the details of the meson - meson interactions .",
    "this is due to the proximity of the @xmath17 threshold .",
    "in particular the detailed structure of the @xmath15 _ e.g. _ whether it is a genuine bound state or a virtual bound sate , strongly depends on the threshold @xmath17 interaction parameters .",
    "since the @xmath17 channel also influences the higher mass region a proper description of its dynamics is crucial for a partial wave analysis and the identification of exotic , hybrid or glueball signals .",
    "furthermore the @xmath17 system is relevant for testing the origins of cp violation and possible signals of cpt violation via hadronic interferometry  @xcite .",
    "the data on the near threshold @xmath17 production are very scarce and come mainly from high - energy peripheral production  @xcite . in the medium - energy region , @xmath18 , it is advantageous to study the @xmath17 system in photoproduction .",
    "a real photon couples strongly to vector mesons and near the @xmath17 threshold @xmath19 photoproduction dominates the @xmath17 spectrum . in this energy range",
    "the @xmath19 photoproduction cross section is large ,  @xmath20 , and has an energy dependence characteristic for diffraction .",
    "the @xmath21-channel baryon resonance production cross section is highly suppressed at these energies , and the @xmath22-channel meson exchange ( @xmath23 ) is marginally relevant only at @xmath24 very close to threshold  @xcite . finally , the @xmath3-wave @xmath17 state , dominated in this mass range by the @xmath15 in the isoscalar and by the @xmath16 in the isovector channel , can be accessed via interference with the @xmath19 meson in the @xmath4-wave .",
    "this @xmath25 interference was first explored in experiments at desy  @xcite and daresbury  @xcite , and could be further studied with high statistics at an energy upgraded jlab .    in the analysis of the data from the desy and daresbury experiments ,",
    "however , the rich spectrum of the @xmath3-wave @xmath17 has not been fully explored . in both cases",
    "the @xmath3-wave was parameterized as either a simple breit - wigner resonance or a nonresonant background .",
    "the two analyses yielded results for the @xmath3-wave production cross section different from each other by more than one order of magnitude .",
    "finally , apart of the @xmath0 mass spectrum , only one moment @xmath26 , describing the @xmath27 angular distribution , has been analyzed and very simplified assumptions about the nucleon spin dependence have been done .    in this paper",
    "we use the results of a recent calculation of the coupled channel scalar - isoscalar and scalar - isovector spectra together with a diffractive model for @xmath4-wave production to interpret the existing @xmath25 interference data and estimate the @xmath3-wave production cross section with a better accuracy than in the phenomenological analyses already published in [ 16 - 18 ] . here",
    "we shall discuss a complete set of six moments @xmath28 of spherical harmonics including @xmath29 and @xmath30 . in the following section we shall present the theoretical foundation of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave photoproduction and discuss the main features of the existing data . in sect .",
    "3 we present results of the numerical analysis and fits to the data . conclusions and outlook are given in sect .",
    "in this paper we consider unpolarized @xmath17 photoproduction reaction @xmath33 for incident photon laboratory energies @xmath24 of the order of a few gev .",
    "this is an optimum energy range for the @xmath3-wave @xmath17 production . in this energy range",
    "the process is dominated by the pomeron exchange , leading to @xmath19-meson production which becomes even more important as the photon energy increases .",
    "however , @xmath22-channel processes expected to be responsible for the production decrease rapidly with energy . the experimental evidence for the @xmath25 interference in the @xmath24 range between 2.8 and 6.7 gev was presented in [ 16 - 18 ] .",
    "the values of the @xmath3-wave photoproduction cross sections found in these experimental analyses varied between 2.7 and 96 nb . in both cases , in the effective mass range @xmath34 , in the rest frame of the @xmath17 system an asymmetry in the kaon polar angle distribution was observed .",
    "this can only be the case if there are odd powers of @xmath35 in the angular distribution . for low partial waves",
    "this implies presence of both @xmath3- and @xmath4- waves .",
    "this feature of the angular distribution is independent of the magnetic - quantum number _",
    "i.e. _ choice of the quantization axis . due to the empirical @xmath21-channel helicity conservation ,",
    "diffractive production is most naturally analyzed in the @xmath36 helicity frame , which in our case corresponds to the rest frame of the @xmath17 pair with the @xmath37-axis anti - parallel to the direction of the recoiling nucleon . in another reference frame , called the @xmath22-channel frame or the gottfried - jackson frame , the @xmath37-axis is chosen along the direction of the photon beam with the @xmath17 pair at rest  @xcite . in both cases the @xmath38-axis is perpendicular to the production plane .    as discussed in  @xcite , in this energy range , the @xmath3-wave production is expected to be dominated by vector @xmath39 , @xmath40 and pseudoscalar @xmath23 , @xmath41 @xmath22-channel exchanges .    as a function of the momentum transfer squared @xmath22 ,",
    "the kaon pair invariant mass @xmath42 and the @xmath27 decay angles @xmath43 in the @xmath21-channel frame the photoproduction amplitude restricted to @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave s can be written as @xmath44 here @xmath45 , @xmath46 and @xmath47 denote the photon , target proton and recoil proton helicities , respectively , and @xmath48 are the spherical harmonics .",
    "the corresponding four - momenta will be denoted by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 and @xmath53 will be used for the @xmath27 and the @xmath54 momenta , respectively .",
    "the unpolarized differential cross section is given by @xmath55 is the proton mass , @xmath56 is the kaon mass and @xmath57 is the kaon momentum in the rest system of the @xmath17 pair . the @xmath3-wave amplitude @xmath58 and the @xmath4-wave amplitude @xmath59 have been described in  @xcite , respectively . here",
    "we will briefly summarize the basic properties of these amplitudes .",
    "the @xmath3-wave @xmath17 production is parameterized as a double exchange . in the upper meson vertex we use a simple meson exchange and",
    "allow for an interaction of the two produced mesons in the final state .",
    "the dominant exchanges for the @xmath3-wave @xmath17 production are shown in . at the nucleon",
    "vertex we use either normal or regge propagators of the exchanged vector mesons .",
    "the normal propagator of the vector meson of the mass @xmath60 is equal to @xmath61 and the regge type propagator reads @xmath62~\\gamma(1 - \\alpha(t))~      ( \\alpha's)^{\\alpha(t)}/(2s^{\\alpha_0}),\\ ] ] where we have the vector meson trajectory @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 gev@xmath66 .",
    "1 : the amplitude for the @xmath3-wave @xmath17 production . the @xmath67 in the born amplitude @xmath68 stands for @xmath23 , @xmath41 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons , the @xmath69 stands for @xmath39 or @xmath40 mesons and @xmath70 denotes either a @xmath71 or @xmath17 pair . the oval represents the final state rescattering amplitude .",
    "the final state interactions include the @xmath71 and @xmath17 channels .",
    "both interactions can have a resonant character .",
    "this is important since the in the mass region of interest , @xmath72 , is dominated by the @xmath15 and @xmath16 resonances .",
    "we should notice that the @xmath0 system is an equal mixture of the isospin 0 and isospin 1 states .",
    "the isoscalar @xmath15 resonance has a main branching to @xmath71 and in addition an important coupling to @xmath17 .",
    "the isovector @xmath16 resonance lies also very close to the @xmath17 threshold so one should take it into account in the calculations of the final state interactions . the @xmath3-wave @xmath0 photoproduction amplitude @xmath73",
    "can therefore be written as @xmath74 and decomposed as @xmath75 $ ] . here",
    "@xmath76 is the photon helicity four - vector and @xmath77 is the @xmath3-wave projection of the appropriate current operator . as illustrated in fig",
    "1 each @xmath3-wave amplitude is a sum of products of the born amplitudes @xmath78 describing the @xmath22-channel meson or regge exchanges and the final state interaction factors @xmath79 @xmath80 if we restrict ourselves to the on - shell part of the final state coupled channel interactions , represented by the 2@xmath812 @xmath3-matrix elements @xmath82 , then the factors @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 is the effective mass of the @xmath70 pion or kaon pair and @xmath87 is the pion or kaon mass .",
    "the explicit forms of the @xmath3-wave born amplitudes @xmath88 are given in  @xcite .",
    "the magnitude of the off - shell part of the final state interaction amplitude is much less certain than the on - shell part as has been shown in  @xcite .",
    "thus we prefer here to use only the on - shell part of the amplitude and correct it later by a constant modification factor . in comparison with  @xcite we have added in these amplitudes a @xmath22- dependent factor @xmath89 , where the parameter @xmath90 gev@xmath66 is responsible for a spatial dimension of the meson ( kaon or pion ) coupled to the photon . in  @xcite the meson in the upper vertex in fig .",
    "1 was treated as a pointlike particle .",
    "the isoscalar @xmath82 matrix elements can be expressed by the scalar- isoscalar phase shifts @xmath91 and inelasticity @xmath92 in two channels @xmath71 and @xmath17 : @xmath93 these elements have been computed in  @xcite and here we use the solution a corresponding to the so - called `` down - flat '' data of the phase shift analysis  @xcite .",
    "the i=1 @xmath17 interaction near 1 gev is very strongly influenced by the @xmath16 resonance which decays dominantly into the @xmath94 .",
    "a coupled channel model including the @xmath94 and @xmath17 states has been formulated in  @xcite and recently compared to the existing data  @xcite . as a result",
    "one obtains the @xmath17 scalar - isovector @xmath3-matrix elements @xmath95 which differ from the scalar - isoscalar @xmath3-matrix elements written in ( [ si0 ] ) .",
    "this new information has been incorporated into calculations of the final state @xmath0 interactions .",
    "the @xmath4-wave amplitudes corresponding to a given projection m of the @xmath0 angular momentum on the quantization axis can be handled in a similar way as the @xmath3-wave , _ i.e. _ we write @xmath96 with @xmath97 being the @xmath4-wave projection of the current .",
    "the @xmath4-wave current is described in detail in  @xcite . in particular , it is saturated by the diffractive @xmath19-meson production , @xmath98 ,                                    \\label{p}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 are the dirac matrices , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are @xmath19 mass and width , respectively .",
    "the lorentz - dirac structure of the current is motivated by the donnachie - landshoff model for the pomeron exchange which assumes vector coupling of the pomeron to hadrons  @xcite .",
    "the two terms in  ( [ p ] ) are needed to preserve electromagnetic current conservation , @xmath102 .",
    "one can show that @xmath103 is satisfied independently by each projection of the @xmath17 spin , @xmath104 .",
    "then in the phenomenological analysis of the data one can separately modify different @xmath105 components by multiplying them by constant factors .",
    "the function @xmath106 is a phenomenological function which will be suitably parameterized to reproduce , at fixed energy , the @xmath22-dependence of the observed its analytical form will be specified in the next section .",
    "we note , however , that this model for the @xmath4-wave does not lead to significant suppression of the single helicity flip amplitude .",
    "in particular in the high energy limit of @xmath107 and @xmath108 the helicity non - flip , single - flip and double - flip amplitudes with @xmath109 behave as    @xmath110    respectively .",
    "the proportionality constant @xmath111 contains the breit - wigner propagator of  ( [ p ] ) and is finite as @xmath112 .",
    "the diagonal elements of the matrix @xmath113 are finite and the off - diagonal ones , corresponding to nucleon helicity flip , are @xmath114 .",
    "thus the only suppression of the photon - meson coupling comes from the angular momentum conservation factor @xmath115 , but it is otherwise finite at high energy .",
    "the existing data on @xmath19 photoproduction suggest that the helicity flip amplitude is of the order of @xmath116 of the dominant , helicity non - flip one at photon energies below @xmath117  @xcite .",
    "thus , qualitatively the model has the correct features but the quantitative agreement may require adjusting the normalization and the phase of the helicity flip amplitudes .",
    "this can be done by multiplication of these amplitudes by a constant complex factor @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is a real positive number and @xmath120 is an additional phase of the @xmath4-wave amplitude with @xmath121 .",
    "we will not modify phases of the dominant helicity non - flip amplitudes , however we do change slightly their moduli as well as the moduli of small double helicity flip amplitudes to keep the total @xmath4-wave cross - section untouched .",
    "the phases of the small double helicity flip amplitudes are the same as the phases of the corresponding non - flip amplitudes . similarly , for the @xmath3-wave amplitudes we introduce a constant modification factor equal to @xmath122 .",
    "it is assumed that the parameters @xmath123 and @xmath124 do not depend on proton helicities @xmath46 nor @xmath47 .",
    "the experimental data on the angular distribution of the @xmath17 pair are given in terms of the moments @xmath125 of the angular distribution evaluated in the @xmath21-channel helicity frame , @xmath126 where @xmath127 takes into account the photon flux and the 1/4 factor standing before the sum in ( [ ds / dtdmdo ] ) .",
    "the lowest moment is normalized to the @xmath0 mass distribution integrated over the momentum transfer squared range limited by @xmath128 and @xmath129 : @xmath130 in terms of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-partial waves , the non - vanishing moments are @xmath131 here @xmath3 , @xmath4 stand for @xmath58 and @xmath59 amplitudes , respectively , and summation over photon and nucleon spin indices is implicit , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath132 the dominant @xmath133 and @xmath134 waves originating from @xmath135 and helicity non - flip production will manifest themselves in a large , positive @xmath136 and a large negative @xmath137 near @xmath138  the mass of the @xmath19 resonance .",
    "this is indeed the dominant feature of the data as shown in figs . 3 and 4 . since @xmath139 the @xmath3-wave is not expected to be significant in the mass spectrum _",
    "i.e. _ in the @xmath140 moment . it will primarily contribute to the @xmath35 asymmetry measured by the @xmath141 and the @xmath142 moments .",
    "for diffractive @xmath4-wave production with equal phases of all it is expected that @xmath143 since the latter describes the interference between the @xmath3- and the helicity flip @xmath144-wave which has a smaller magnitude than @xmath133 one .",
    "the data suggests , however , that the two moments are comparable with more structure actually seen in the @xmath141 moment .",
    "this can only be possible if we allow a well defined pattern of phases in the three waves .",
    "this justifies our choice of additional parameters as already described above . in the following section we discuss the results of fitting this model to the experimental data .",
    "in the analysis of the @xmath3- and @xmath4-wave production we compare the model described above to the @xmath22 , @xmath42 and angular distribution of the @xmath17 system at two photon energies , @xmath145  @xcite and @xmath146  @xcite .",
    "the two photon energies represent averages of the photon beam energies used in the experiments performed at daresbury and at desy , respectively . at first",
    "we discuss the momentum transfer dependence of the cross section integrated over the @xmath17 effective mass and the kaon emission angles .      at 4 gev photon energy the comparison between the experimentally measured differential cross section @xmath148 and the model cross section integrated over the @xmath17 mass is shown in    fig .",
    "2 : differential cross section at @xmath149  gev . the solid line shows the model for the @xmath19 photoproduction , the dotted line is the @xmath4-wave contribution with m=0 multiplied by the branching ratio of the @xmath19 decay into the @xmath0 pair .",
    "the dashed line is the @xmath3-wave part of the @xmath0 cross section calculated for normal @xmath150 propagators , while the double dotted - dashed line corresponds to the regge propagators .",
    "model parameters are given in data are from fig .",
    "6b of  @xcite .    for this comparison ,",
    "the @xmath22-dependent normalization @xmath106 in the @xmath4-wave was chosen as @xmath151 where the normalization constant @xmath152 has been adjusted to reproduce the very forward value of @xmath153gev@xmath154 at small argument , @xmath155gev@xmath154 , and the remaining parameters have been chosen as @xmath156 gev@xmath154 and @xmath157 gev@xmath66 .",

    "the @xmath4-wave was described in terms of diffractive production of the @xmath19 resonance decaying into the @xmath0 system .",
    "the @xmath3-wave and the @xmath4-wave contain 4 and 12 independent amplitudes respectively and we included them all while previous analyses made a severe truncation to a single amplitude in each wave .",
    "we have shown that amplitudes omitted in the analyses of  @xcite corresponding to the proton helicity non - flip are large and can not be ignored . in the previous analyses only the @xmath220 moment was taken into account and this led to a large variation in the estimate of the @xmath3-wave photoproduction cross section , between @xmath221 at @xmath222  @xcite and @xmath223 at @xmath224  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we have considered all six moments appearing in the model with @xmath3- and @xmath4-waves which enabled us to isolate the production cross section from that of an incoherent background .",
    "this led to a significant , order of magnitude , reduction in the uncertainty in the @xmath3-wave production and reduced the value of cross section at @xmath225 from @xmath226 to approximately @xmath227 , thus eliminating the discrepancy between the two measurements ( also suggested in  @xcite ) .",
    "thus we have found that the @xmath3-wave photoproduction cross section integrated over the @xmath19 resonance region is between 4 and 7 nb for the two photon energies 4 and 5.65 gev .",
    "the cross section of the photon helicity - flip @xmath144-wave , which interferes with the @xmath3-wave is found to be somewhat larger than the @xmath3-wave cross section , in the range between 5 and 14 nb .",
    "new more precise measurements of the @xmath17 photoproduction with a _ simultaneous _ determination of the @xmath71 cross - section in the @xmath71 effective mass region near 1@xmath228 could provide new insight into the still controversial nature of the scalar mesons @xmath15 and @xmath16 . + * acknowledgments *    we thank chueng - ryong ji and robert kamiski for their collaboration on the @xmath3-wave photoproduction and for an exchange of ideas on the @xmath4-wave amplitudes in the early stage of this work .",
    "one of us ( l. l. ) would like to thank maria raska and jacek turnau for enlightening discussions on the analysis of experimental data .",
    "this work was supported in part ( a. p. s. ) by the us department of energy grant under contract de - fg0287er40365 ."
