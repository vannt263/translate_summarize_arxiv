    "since the discovery of the high - temperature superconductors in 1986 , there has been intense study of a number of two - dimensional models that are believed to model the electronic properties of the cuo@xmath2 plane of the cuprate superconductors , for example , the hubbard model , the @xmath3 model , and the heisenberg model.@xcite two - dimensional quantum models with short - range kinetic and interaction terms are difficult to study . in one dimension , there are exact solutions using the bethe ansatz and a host of related analytical techniques,@xcite and there is a very accurate numerical method , the density - matrix renormalization group ( dmrg),@xcite that can be applied to large systems relatively easily . in two dimensions , on the other hand , there are few exact solutions ( one famous nontrivial case is the hubbard model with one hole in a half - filled background , the nagaoka state@xcite ) , and current numerical methods are not satisfactory ( quantum monte carlo is plagued by the negative sign problem@xcite at low temperatures and at many fillings of interest and the dmrg in two dimensions@xcite is still in early development stage ) .",
    "the most reliable method for studying complicated quantum systems is exact diagonalization , which means enumerating all basis states and diagonalizing the resulting hamiltonian matrix .",
    "of course , this method is computationally limited by the growth of the hilbert space which is in general exponential in the number of particles and the lattice size . the @xmath4 hubbard model with 16 electrons , 8 spin - up and 8 spin - down , after reduction by particle conservation , translation , and the symmetries of the square",
    ", has 1,310,242 states in the largest matrix block,@xcite and can be diagonalized using the well - known lanczos method .",
    "the hubbard model has been diagonalized for the @xmath4 lattice ( see e.g. , ref .  ) , and at low filling ( four electrons ) for @xmath5@xcite with extensive employment of symmetries .",
    "we have asked the question : _ is there a model that contains the basic ingredient of short - range hopping and interaction but is simpler , in the exact diagonalization sense , than the hubbard model ? _",
    "the answer is yes : we can neglect the spin .",
    "we obtain the following hamiltonian for _ spinless _ fermions , @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are spinless fermion creation and annihilation operators at site @xmath9 , @xmath10 the number operator , @xmath11 the nearest - neighbor hopping amplitude , and @xmath12 the nearest - neighbor interaction .",
    "note that with spinless fermions , there can be at the most one particle per site ; no on - site interaction ( as that in the hubbard model ) is possible , and we have included in our hamiltonian nearest - neighbor repulsion .    the spinless fermion model , eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) , is a two - state model , and the number of basis states for a @xmath13-site system is @xmath14 , which is a significant reduction from the @xmath15 of the hubbard model .",
    "we can further reduce the number of basis states by taking the nearest - neighbor interaction @xmath16 , i.e. , infinite repulsion , which excludes nearest neighbors , giving roughly @xmath17 states .    the spinless fermion model with infinite repulsion eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) contains a significant reduction of the hilbert space . after using particle conservation and translation symmetry ( but not point group symmetry ) ,",
    "the largest matrix for the @xmath0 system has @xmath18 states ( for 11 particles ) , and we can therefore compute for all fillings the @xmath0 system whereas for the hubbard model @xmath4 is basically the limit .",
    "this of course means that for certain limits we can also go much further than the hubbard model , for example , we can handle four particles on a @xmath1 lattice where the number of basis states is @xmath19 .",
    "this extended capability with our model has enabled us to obtain a number of results that are difficult to obtain with the hubbard model .",
    "an added feature of our model is that the basis set for the spinless fermion problem is identical to that for the hardcore boson problem , because with hardcore repulsion , there can be at the most one boson at one site also .",
    "therefore , without computational difficulty , we can study numerically both the spinless fermion and hardcore boson problem .",
    "spinless fermions can also be realized in experiments , for example , the spin polarized @xmath20he due to a strong magnetic field , or ferro or ferri - magnetic electronic systems where one spin - band is filled . the one - dimensional spinless fermion model with finite repulsion",
    "is solved exactly using bethe ansatz.@xcite the infinite - dimensional problem is studied in ref .  .",
    "a very different approach using the renormalization group for fermions is done in ref .  .",
    "a monte carlo study of the two - dimensional model at half - filling only and low temperatures is in ref .  , which , dating back to 1985 , is one of the earliest quantum monte carlo simulations for fermions .",
    "( it is no coincidence that they chose the model with the smallest hilbert space . )",
    "considering the tremendous effort that has been devoted to the hubbard model and the close resemblance of our model , eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) , to the hubbard model , it is surprising that works on this spinless model have been rather sparse , though it has been commented that the spinless model offers considerable simplifications.@xcite    this paper is one of the two that we are publishing to study systematically the two - dimensional spinless fermion and hardcore boson model with infinite nearest - neighbor repulsion .",
    "the present paper focuses on the dilute limit , treating the problem of a few particles , and the other paper@xcite will focus on the dense limit , near half - filled,@xcite where stripes ( that are holes lining up across the lattice ) are natural objects ( see ref .   for a condensed study of stripes in this model )",
    ". we will use lanczos exact diagonalization , exploiting the much - reduced hilbert space of our model , and a number of analytical techniques , for example , in this paper , lattice green functions and the t - matrix .",
    "one of the goals of these two papers is to advertise this model of spinless fermions to the strongly - correlated electron community , as we believe that it is the simplest model of correlated fermions and deserves more research effort and better understanding",
    ".    the prior work most comparable to ours may be the studies of four spinless electrons in a @xmath5 lattice , with coulomb repulsion , by pichard _",
    "et al _ ;  @xcite their motivation was the wigner crystal melting and the competition of coulomb interactions with anderson localization when a disorder potential is turned on .      at the dilute limit of our model ,",
    "the scattering t - matrix is of fundamental importance . for two particles",
    ", we expect that , at least when the potential @xmath12 is small , we can write a perturbative equation for energy , @xmath21 which is to say that the exact interacting energy of two particles is the noninteracting energy @xmath22 , for a pair of momenta @xmath23 and @xmath24 , plus a correction term @xmath25 due to the interaction @xmath12 . and with more than two particles , at least when the particle density is low , we expect to have @xmath26 eq .",
    "( [ eq - perturbmany ] ) is central in fermi liquid theory , where it is justified by the so - called `` adiabatic continuation '' idea , which says that interacting fermion states correspond one - to - one to noninteracting ones as we slowly switch on a potential .    in the boson case , because many bosons can occupy one quantum mechanical state and form a condensate , eq .",
    "( [ eq - perturbmany ] ) should be modified , but with only two bosons , we expect eq .",
    "( [ eq - perturb ] ) should be valid ( in that the correction vanishes in the dilute limit ) .",
    "( [ eq - perturb ] ) and ( [ eq - perturbmany ] ) are used when we look at a list of noninteracting energies and draw correspondences with the interacting energies , the energy shift being packaged in the term @xmath25 .",
    "one possible objection to the above formulas ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq - perturb ] ) and ( [ eq - perturbmany ] ) ) is that they appear to be perturbative , yet the interaction potential in our problem is infinitely strong , so the first - order ( first born approximation ) scattering amplitude , being proportional to the potential , is infinite too .",
    "however , this singular potential scattering problem ( e.g. , hard - sphere interaction in 3d ) has been solved ( see ref .  ) by replacing the potential with the so - called scattering length , which is finite even when the potential is infinite .",
    "as we review in appendix  [ sec - physical ] , a perturbation series ( born series ) can be written down ( that corresponds to a series of the so - called ladder diagrams ) and even though each term is proportional to the potential , the sum of all terms ( the t - matrix , @xmath25 in eqs .",
    "( [ eq - perturb ] ) and ( [ eq - perturbmany ] ) ) is finite .    because the t - matrix captures two - body interaction effects , it is the centerpiece of dilute fermion and boson calculations with strong interactions .",
    "field - theoretical calculations in both three and two dimensions are based on the ladder diagrams and the t - matrix .",
    "see fetter and walecka@xcite for the 3d problem , schick@xcite for the 2d boson problem and bloom@xcite the 2d fermion problem . for lattice fermion problems",
    ", kanamori@xcite derived the t - matrix for a tight - binding model that is essentially a hubbard model ( this work is also described in yosida@xcite ) . and in ref .",
    ", the t - matrix is worked out explicitly for the hubbard model , and kanamori s result is obtained . ref .",
    "also evaluated the t - matrix for the dilute limit in three dimensions and obtained a functional dependence on particle density .",
    "rudin and mattis@xcite used the t - matrix expression derived in refs .   and and found upper and lower bounds of the fermion t - matrix in two dimensions in terms of particle density .",
    "rudin and mattis s result for the low - density limit of the two - dimensional hubbard model is of the same functional form as bloom s diagrammatical calculation for the two - dimensional fermion hard disks.@xcite since the discovery of high - temperature superconductors , bloom s calculation has received a lot of attention because of its relevance to the validity of the fermi liquid description of dilute fermions in two dimensions .",
    "there have been a number of works on the 2d dilute fermi gas@xcite and on the dilute limit of 2d hubbard model,@xcite all using the t - matrix , but these results have not been checked by numerical calculations .",
    "in fact , we are not aware of a systematic study of the t - matrix for a lattice model . in this paper",

    "we check the t - matrix results with exact diagonalization data and show that our t - matrix on a lattice is the sum of the two - body scattering terms to infinite order .      in this paper",

    "( [ eq - ham ] ) , focusing on the problem of a few particles .",
    "our paper is divided into four parts .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - green ] , the two - particle ( boson and fermion ) problem is studied .",
    "we formulated the two - particle schrodinger equation using lattice green functions , employ some of its recursion relations to simplify the problem , and obtain the two - boson ground state energy in the large - lattice limit . using the two - particle result ,",
    "we then study the problem of a few particles and obtain an expression for ground state energy on a large lattice .    in sec .",
    "[ sec - tmat ] , the two - particle problem is then cast into a different form , emphasizing the scatterings between the two particles .",
    "the result is the t - matrix , that is exact for the two - particle problem and contains all two - body scattering terms .",
    "we will study the two - particle t - matrix in great detail , showing the differences between the boson and fermion cases , and demonstrating that the first t - matrix iteration is often a good approximation for fermion energy . in appendix",
    "[ sec - physical ] , we show explicitly that the t - matrix we obtain is the sum total of all two - body scattering terms .",
    "the problem of a few fermions is taken up in sec .",

    "we show the modifications to the two - fermion t - matrix that enable us to calculate energies for three , four , and five particles . using this t - matrix",
    ", we can compute the interaction corrections to the noninteracting energy and trace the change in the energy spectrum from the nointeracting one to the interacting one .    finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec - dilute ] , we discuss the energy per particle curve for dilute bosons and fermions . we have studied the two - dimensional results derived by schick@xcite for bosons and bloom@xcite for fermions by fitting the data from diagonalization for a number of lattices .",
    "schick s result for dilute bosons is checked nicely , and we explain that for spinless fermions in our model we will need the p - wave scattering term , which is not included in bloom s calculation .    in appendix  [ sec - diag ] , we discuss briefly our exact diagonalization computer program , which can handle arbitary periodic boundaries specified by two vectors on the square lattice and uses translation symmetry to reduce the matrix size .",
    "the two - particle problem has appeared in many different contexts .",
    "the most familiar one is the hydrogen atom problem in introductory quantum mechanics textbooks .",
    "the two - magnon problem is closely related mathematically to our two - particle problem , and it has been solved in arbitary dimensions for ferromagnets ( see e.g. , ref .  ) .",
    "another important two - particle problem is the cooper problem , with two electrons in the presence of a fermi sea ( see e.g. , ref .  ) . and",
    "motivated by the possibility of cooper pair formation in high - temperature superconductors , there have also been a number of studies on bound states on a two - dimensional lattice.@xcite the two - electron problem in the plain two - dimensional repulsive hubbard model is studied in ref .  , and ground state energy in the large - lattice limit is obtained analytically .    in this section",
    ", we present a rather complete calculation for the two - particle problem in our model , treating both bosons and fermions . with infinite repulsive interaction in our model , we are not interested in finding bound states . we calculate eigenenergies for all states for a finite - size lattice , and our calculation is more complicated than the hubbard model@xcite case because of nearest - neighbor ( in place of on - site ) interaction . where the green function in the hubbard case was a scalar object , in our case it is replaced by a @xmath4 matrix , corresponding to the four nearest neighbor sites where the potential acts .",
    "this green function study of the two - particle problem is closely related to the treatment of the two - electron problem in the hubbard model@xcite and that in an extended hubbard model.@xcite we will show the use of lattice symmetry and recursion relations to simplify the problem with nearest - neighbor interactions .      in this two - particle calculation",
