    "cetaceans include the largest animals ever to live , including the blue whale ( _ balaenoptera musculus _ ) , which is nearly 30 times larger than an african elephant and twice as large as the largest sauropod .",
    "however , the reasons for their enormous sizes or the possibility of still larger animals remains unclear .",
    "a deeper understanding of the evolutionary mechanisms shaping cetacean sizes would shed light on the role of energetic constraints in limiting species sizes  @xcite , and the interaction of macroecological patterns  @xcite and macroevolutionary processes  @xcite in the oceans .",
    "it may also shed light on how long - term trends in species mass  @xcite , e.g. , cope s rule , the empirically observed tendency for species masses to increase within a lineage over evolutionary time  @xcite , operate in marine environments .",
    "many major animal clades , including mammals , birds , fish and insects , seem to exhibit a canonical pattern in the distribution of species masses  @xcite . for example , the most common size of a terrestrial mammal is roughly @xmath3 ( common pacific rat , _ rattus exulans _ ) .",
    "both larger and smaller species are much less common , but asymmetrically so : the largest species , like the extinct imperial mammoth ( _ mammuthus imperator _ , @xmath4 ) , are orders of magnitude larger , while the smallest , like remy s pygmy shrew ( _ suncus remyi _ , @xmath0 ) , are only a little smaller ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sizes ] ) .    both the precise shape and the origins of this ubiquitous pattern",
    "have long been a topic of ecological  @xcite and evolutionary  @xcite interest .",
    "recently , this pattern was shown to be a long - term evolutionary consequence when a minimum viable body size , e.g. , from physiological or thermoregulatory limits  @xcite , constrains a macroevolutionary tradeoff between short - term selective advantages  @xcite and long - term extinction risks from increased species size  @xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig : model]a ) .",
    "early versions of this model  @xcite demonstrated that species size evolution in the presence of a fixed lower limit produces right - skewed distributions that are qualitatively similar to the empirical pattern .",
    "however , these models also predict an unending increase in the size of the largest species , without necessarily adding new species .",
    "the key missing mechanism is extinction risk , which empirically tends to increase with species body size  @xcite and thereby limit the number and size of large species . in this way , the characteristic pattern in species sizes can be explained from simple macroevolutionary mechanisms : speciation , variation , extinction and a physiological minimum size .",
    "historically , the main alternative explanation assumed the existence of a taxon - specific energetically optimal body size  @xcite . at this size ,",
    "species maximize their `` reproductive power , '' i.e. , the rate at which they convert environmental resources into offspring .",
    "dispersion away from this optimum size was interpreted as evidence of interspecific competition . however",
    ", this theory remains controversial and , among other reasons  @xcite , contradicts strong evidence from the fossil record in the form of cope s rule , a general statistical tendency for descendant species to be larger than their ancestors  @xcite , and the fact that most species are not close to their group s predicted optimal size .",
    "although the macroevolutionary tradeoff hypothesis has been quantitatively tested for extant terrestrial mammals  @xcite and birds  @xcite , and its temporal dynamics have been shown to agree with the expansion of terrestrial mammals in the late cretaceous and early paleogene  @xcite , it remains unknown precisely how general this hypothesis is .",
    "for instance , it is unknown whether it holds for subclades of mammalia , for fully aquatic mammals ( which have typically been omitted from previous analyses ) , for ectothermic species , etc .",
    "we resolve several of these questions by testing the tradeoff theory s ability to explain the observed body size distribution of cetaceans , the largest and most diverse marine mammal clade .",
    "cetaceans are an ideal test case for the theory .",
    "first , cetacea is a sufficiently speciose clade ( 77 extant species ) to allow a quantitative comparison of predicted and observed distributions .",
    "sirenia , the only other fully aquatic mammal clade , contains four extant species , which is too small for a productive comparison .",
    "second , semiaquatic groups like pinnipeds ( seals and walruses ) and mustelids ( otters ) can not be used to test the theory because they spend significant time on land , thus avoiding the hard thermoregulatory constraint assumed by the theory .",
    "thus , by focusing on cetaceans , we provide a reasonable test of the theory .",
    "third , fully aquatic mammals like cetaceans have typically been omitted in past studies because their marine habitat induces a different lower limit on mass than is seen in terrestrial mammals . as a result",
    ", it remains unknown whether the theory extends to all mammals , or only those in terrestrial environments .",
    "finally , cetacean body masses do indeed exhibit the canonical right - skewed pattern ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sizes ] ) : the median size ( @xmath5 , _ tursiops truncatus _ ) is close to the smallest ( @xmath6 , _ pontoporia blainvillei _ ) but far from the largest ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "this suggests that the theory may indeed hold for them .    here",
    ", we test the strongest possible form of the macroevolutionary tradeoff theory for cetacean sizes . instead of estimating model parameters from cetacean data , we combine parameters estimated from terrestrial mammals with a theoretically determined choice for the lower limit on cetacean species body mass .",
    "the resulting model has no tunable parameters by which to adjust its predicted distribution . in this way",
    ", we answer the question of how large a whale should be : if the predicted distribution agrees with the observed sizes , the same short - term versus long - term tradeoff that determines the sizes of terrestrial mammals also determines the sizes of whales .",
    "we find that this zero - parameter model provides a highly accurate prediction of cetacean sizes .",
    "thus , a single universal tradeoff mechanism appears to explain the body sizes of all mammal species , but this mechanism must obey the thermoregulatory limits imposed by the environment in which it unfolds .",
    "it is this one difference ",
    "thermoregulation in air for terrestrial mammals and in water for aquatic mammals  that explains the different locations of their respective body size distributions .",
    "energetic constraints , while a popular historical explanation for sizes , seem to be only part of the puzzle for understanding the distribution of species sizes . under this macroevolutionary mechanism",
    ", the size of the largest observed species is set by the tradeoff between the extinction probability at large sizes and the rate at which smaller species evolve to larger body masses , both of which may depend partly on energetic and ecological factors ."

    "<S> the evolution and distribution of species body sizes for terrestrial mammals is well - explained by a macroevolutionary tradeoff between short - term selective advantages and long - term extinction risks from increased species body size , unfolding above the @xmath0 minimum size induced by thermoregulation in air . here , we consider whether this same tradeoff , formalized as a constrained convection - reaction - diffusion system , can also explain the sizes of fully aquatic mammals , which have not previously been considered . by replacing the terrestrial minimum with a pelagic one , at roughly @xmath1 , the terrestrial mammal tradeoff model accurately predicts , with no tunable parameters , the observed body masses of all extant cetacean species , including the @xmath2 blue whale . </S>",
