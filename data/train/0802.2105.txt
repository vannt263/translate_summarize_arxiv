    "quasars are among the most luminous astrophysical objects , and are believed to be powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "they have become a key element in our current paradigm of galaxy evolution ",
    "essentially all spheroidal systems at present harbor massive black holes @xcite , the masses of which are correlated with many properties of their host systems .",
    "however , the physical mechanisms that trigger and fuel quasars are still unknown ; furthermore , it is possible that very different mechanisms dominate at low and high redshifts and at high and low luminosities .    deep imaging with the hubble space telescope ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) suggest that low-@xmath11 qsos are exclusively hosted by bright galaxies with @xmath12 .",
    "radio - loud qsos reside in early - type galaxies , while their radio - quiet counterparts have both early and late type hosts , with the fraction of early type hosts increasing with the quasar optical luminosity . in most cases",
    "there is strong observational evidence for the presence of a young ( subdominant ) stellar population @xcite and large amounts of gas , irrespective of the morphological type of the host @xcite .",
    "furthermore , 30 - 50 per cent of quasars appear to be associated with interactions , although the number of such imaged systems is small , and signatures of mergers are notoriously difficult to observe .",
    "the emerging picture is that qso activity and star formation are inextricably linked ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in galaxies that contain a massive bulge ( and thus a massive black hole ) and a gas reservoir .",
    "the clustering of quasars as a function of redshift and luminosity provides a different perspective on the above picture .",
    "the amplitude of clustering on large scales is related to the masses of the dark matter halos which host the quasars ( their environment ) , which together with the observed number density allows us to constrain the quasar lifetimes or duty cycles .",
    "the small - scale clustering of quasars can shed light on the triggering mechanism for quasars , and the nature of quasar progenitors .",
    "however it is only recently that samples of quasars have grown big enough ( in terms of the number of objects ) to study their clustering with some precision @xcite .",
    "one of the major problems with measuring the clustering of quasars is that they are extremely rare ( @xmath13 at @xmath14 ) .",
    "shot - noise from poisson fluctuations in the counts of objects thus obscures their clustering signal . at low redshifts ,",
    "this problem is exacerbated , requiring measurements in very broad redshift intervals .    to avoid this ,",
    "we cross - correlate approximately @xmath15 low @xmath11 quasars @xcite with a sample of @xmath16 luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) @xcite , both selected from the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sdss ) and with overlapping redshift distributions .",
    "the lrgs have very reliable photometric redshifts @xcite , trace the matter distribution in a way that is well understood and have a much higher volume density ( @xmath17 ) than the quasar sample .",
    "the cross - correlation can thus be well measured and inverted , using the known redshift distribution , to the underlying 3d clustering .    in this paper , we make use of several novel techniques for measuring the clustering of galaxies and quasars , and compute full covariance matrices for our estimators from the data themselves . while the idea of enhancing the clustering signal by using cross - correlations is not new @xcite , the sample size and ability to perform such detailed statistical analyses is new to this paper .",
    "in addition , the precise measurements of lrg clustering allow us for the first time to discuss the manner in which both lrgs and quasars inhabit dark matter halos at @xmath14 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : data ] we describe the lrg and quasar samples , drawn from the sdss , that we use .",
    "the clustering measurements are described in  [ sec : clustering ] , where we pay special attention to the techniques used and the error estimates . the implications of our results for quasars is explored in  [ sec : interp ] , including comparisons with earlier work . in particular",
    "we investigate the manner in which quasars inhabit dark matter halos at @xmath14 .",
    "we conclude in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "appendix [ appendix : halomodel ] contains the technical details of the halo model fits used in this paper , while appendix  [ appendix : serber ] recasts the measurements of @xcite and @xcite into the framework of this paper , highlighting unappreciated subtleties in their interpretation .",
    "where necessary we shall assume a @xmath18cdm cosmological model with @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "also , unless the @xmath22 dependence is explicitly specified , we assume @xmath23 .",
    "we use quasars selected from the fourth edition of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) quasar catalog @xcite .",
    "this catalog consists of spectroscopically identified quasars in the fifth sdss data release @xcite , with an absolute psf magnitude in the @xmath24 band , @xmath25 and at least one emission line with fwhm larger than @xmath26 .",
    "it does not contain type 2 qsos , seyferts or bl lac objects . in order to construct a homogeneous sample ,",

    "we restrict ourselves to quasars that lie within the lrg angular mask , and with redshifts between @xmath31 . the resulting sample ( denoted all below )",
    "has 2476 quasars .",
    "one subtlety with the sdss quasar samples are the changes to the quasar target selection algorithm @xcite over the lifetime of the survey .",
    "however , these changes were made to optimize target selection at high redshifts , and have little effect on our sample . as we discuss below , restricting to quasars selected with the final version of the qso target selection ( v3_1_0 ) does not affect any of our results .",

    "we assume a redshift evolution of @xmath32 ( k - corrected to @xmath33 ) given by @xmath34 with @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 @xcite , where we have converted from the sdss @xmath38 to @xmath24 band with @xmath39 @xcite .",
    "this defines a sample of quasars ( denoted lstar ) with @xmath40 , yielding an approximately volume limited sample over the redshift range we consider . we can estimate the number density of these samples by integrating the broken power - law fit to the qso luminosity function from @xcite , @xmath41 if we assume the parameters estimated from the 2qz and 2slaq surveys i.e. @xmath32 as defined above , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 @xmath45 @xcite , and no scatter between @xmath38 and @xmath24 magnitudes , we estimate a number density of @xmath46 @xmath47 .",
    "if one adopts the parameters from @xcite , we find a number density of @xmath48 @xmath47 , approximately @xmath49 per cent lower .",
    "note that we keep the sample definition the same for both these cases , so one is integrating over magnitudes less than @xmath50 defined by eq .",

    "previous authors @xcite estimated the clustering of quasars by measuring the overdensities of photometric galaxies around quasars in cylindrical apertures . while these measurements can be related to the correlation functions presented in this paper , there are a number of subtleties in their interpretation that have resulted in confusion in the literature .",
    "this appendix attempts to clarify these measurements , as well as compare them with our results .",
    "following @xcite , we define @xmath58 as the average number of photometric galaxies within cylindrical apertures of transverse physical ( as opposed to angular ) radii @xmath59 , centered on quasars ( @xmath60 ) , spectroscopic galaxies ( @xmath38 ) and random points ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "if we assume the photometric sample has a normalized redshift distribution @xmath62 , we use the formalism of  [ sec : clustering ] , to write @xmath63 and @xmath64 \\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the number of random points , quasars and spectroscopic galaxies , @xmath66 is the areal density of the photometric sample , and @xmath67 is the projected cross - correlation between the different samples . as in ",
    "[ sec : clustering ] , @xmath68 implies the redshift distribution of the photometric sample averaged over the redshift distribution of the spectroscopic sample .",
    "normalizing the random galaxies to the number of spectroscopic targets , we then obtain @xmath69 for the quasars with a similar expression for galaxies .",
    "we therefore see that the overdensities measured in @xcite and @xcite can be related to the area - averaged projected correlation function weighted by the redshift distribution of the photometric galaxies at the redshifts of the spectroscopic targets .",
    "this implies that the overdensities of the quasars and galaxies can not be directly compared since they are scaled by _",
    "different _ weights .",
    "furthermore , the overall amplitude of the overdensities can not be interpreted without knowledge of the redshift distribution of the photometric galaxies ( which is non - trivial for high redshift quasars since one is starting to probe the high redshift tail of the photometric galaxies ) .",
    "eq .  [ eq : serberdensity ] has the property that it asymptotes to 1 on large scales irrespective of galaxy type .",
    "we estimate the scale at which @xmath70 as follows ",
    "the redshift distribution of the photometric galaxies spans approximately @xmath71gpc and the integral of @xmath72 must equal unity , suggesting @xmath73 . assuming that the cross - correlation between quasars ( spectroscopic galaxies ) and photometric galaxies is similar to the quasar - lrg cross - correlation",
    ", this implies that the second term of eq .",
    "[ eq : serberdensity ] is @xmath74 on scales @xmath75 .",
    "note that this implies that the overdensities are @xmath74 on all scales , especially on scales larger than a mpc .",
    "we emphasize that this is simply due to the division by the mean density and in no way implies that the quasars and spectroscopic galaxies have the same large scale bias or inhabit halos of similar masses . note that this is a significant difference between spectroscopic and photometric samples - for spectroscopic samples , the width of the redshift distribution is typically a few tens of mpc ( to integrate out redshift space distortions ) , and the second term in eq .  [ eq : serberdensity ] is much larger than the first . in this case",
    ", the overdensities can be directly interpreted as the angle - averaged correlation function . for photometric samples ,",
    "the complications can be simply circumvented by subtracting 1 from the overdensities , if the redshift distribution of the photometric sample is known ( see the discussion above ) . however , neither @xcite nor @xcite do this when comparing with the galaxy samples , and their results must not be interpreted as quasars having the same clustering .",
    "an important corollary to this is that the upturn seen in overdensities can not be interpreted ( as has often been in the literature ) as an excess in small - scale clustering , but is simply the signature of a clustered sample of objects .",
    "indeed , as we show below , the cross - correlation for the quasars is consistent with being a power - law down to small scales .",
    "the final complication in interpreting these results arises due to the width of redshift distribution of the photometric sample .",
    "since the photometric sample covers a large redshift range , it can not be treated as a homogeneous sample and we can not model its auto - correlation as we did with the lrgs . in order to interpret the cross - correlation of the quasars with the photometric sample",
    ", we must therefore compare it with the cross - correlation between a particular population of galaxies and the photometric sample .",
    "unfortunately , for the sdss , quasars and galaxies occupy different redshift ranges ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lowzdist ] ) and therefore probe different sub - populations of the photometric sample .",
    "any comparison between quasars and galaxies must also take into account these population differences , complicating any analysis .",
    "galaxies [ dotted , red ] , photometric galaxies @xmath76 , [ solid , black ] @xcite and spectroscopic quasars with @xmath77 [ dashed , blue ] . note that the normalizations of the redshift distributions are arbitrary .",
    "the figure emphasizes the fact that @xmath78 galaxies and quasars probe very different regions of the photometric redshift distribution , complicating the comparison between their clustering .",
    ", width=288 ]    a detailed modeling of all these effects goes well beyond the scope of this appendix .",
    "however , as an illustration , we take the results of @xcite , subtract 1 , and divide by @xmath79 ; the results are in fig .  [",
    "fig : strand ] .",
    "the clustering is consistent with a three dimensional power law of slope @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "we remind the reader that the value of @xmath82 is completely degenerate with our assumption for @xmath68 .    , of photometric galaxies and quasars in sdss from @xcite assuming @xmath83 ( see text ) .",
