    "we thus find that @xmath300 we estimate that @xmath301 ( about 80 mpc ) , which leads to a maximum void diameter of 400 mpc .",
    "bubbles near the edge of the universe would have a radius of approximately @xmath302 of @xmath291 and thus @xmath303 . at the center of the universe ,",

    "for the theory based on the conservation group , we have developed a static model of the universe . from our fundamental assumption that the total mass - energy is constant",
    ", we use the weak - field approximation to determine a spherically symmetric solution of our field equations that shows promise as a model of the universe .",
    "we also note that this solution is stable , with a wide range of parameter values ( @xmath156 values ) that lead to realistic models .",
    "we find a universe model that is nearly isotropic when @xmath305 . the density of ordinary matter increases with @xmath0 to its greatest value at @xmath154 .",
    "remarkably , we find that the usual gravitational redshift formula leads to redshift values that steadily increase with @xmath0 approximately quadratically and also are in the range of @xmath164 values that are observed .",

    "pure radial motion is seen to depend on the particle s density .",
    "we have shown that redshifts for particle motions are favored and tend to increase with distance and the calculation of @xmath253 illustrates that large redshifts are possible for exceptional events near the edge of the universe .",
    "our discussion also suggests that our model in not inconsistent with cmb observations , although a full analysis may show otherwise .",
    "the necessity of bubbles or voids whose diameter decreases as @xmath0 approaches the edge value of @xmath241 may explain the cmb anisotropies .",
