    "signals transmitted over wireless channels undergo severe degradations due to effects such as path loss , shadowing , fading , and interference from other transmitters , in addition to thermal noise at the receiver . one major way to combat static fading is to provide diversity in either time , frequency , or space @xcite .",
    "for this purpose , multiple - antenna systems that provide high orders of spatial diversity and high capacity have been extensively studied @xcite . however , due to limited terminal sizes , the implementation of two or more antennas may be impossible . based on the seminal works in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the authors in @xcite@xcite set up a framework for _ cooperative communications _",

    "following these works , many researchers have proposed distributed communication schemes and analyzed their outage probability behavior such as in @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the main protocols that have been proposed are the _ amplify - and - forward _ , where the relay only amplifies the signal received from the source , before transmitting it to the destination , and the _ decode - and - forward _ , where the relay decodes the received signal before transmitting it to the destination . in this paper",
    ", we study the performance of distributed space - time bit - interleaved coded modulations ( d - st - bicm ) schemes for non - orthogonal amplify - and - forward protocols .",
    "furthermore , we focus on situations where the transmitter to relay and inter - relay links quality is highly better than the transmitter to receiver link quality .",
    "this situation occurs for example when deploying professional relays on top of buildings in a way to improve the link reliability in low coverage zones of a multi - cellular system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ matryoshka ] defines the matryoshka block - fading channel , a channel that characterizes the cooperative protocol considered in this paper . in section [ system_model ] , we describe the system model and all the parameters involved in our study .",
    "we then derive bounds on the diversity of d - st - bicm for the minimum cooperation frame length in section [ div1 ] , and section [ div2 ] extends these results for any length .",
    "section [ simulations ] shows simulation results for different network topologies , while section [ conclusions ] gives the concluding remarks .",
    "in this paper , we consider the block - fading channel model in which a d - st - bicm codeword undergoes a limited number of fading channel realizations , namely one fading coefficient per spatial path . for the sake of analysis , we introduce a block - fading channel model where the set of random variables of a higher diversity block always includes the set of random variables of a lower diversity block , in a way similar to nested matryoshka dolls .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 independent fading random variables providing a total diversity order of @xmath0 .",
    "let @xmath1 be a channel built from the concatenation of @xmath2 blocks , where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the sets of diversity orders and lengths of each block . as usual ,",

    "the @xmath7-th block has a diversity order equal to @xmath8 and its fading set is @xmath9 with @xmath10 , @xmath11 fading random variables , such that @xmath12 .",
    "thus , we have @xmath13 and @xmath14 or equivalently @xmath15 is the maximum diversity order . this channel defined by nested fading sets",
    "is referred to as a matryoshka channel and it is illustrated in fig .",

    "due to the channel model , the diversity order of this pep is equal to the diversity order of the lowest index block observing a non - zero part of @xmath19 .",
    "the performance of the coded modulation has a diversity order upper - bounded by @xmath20 defined as follows :    the diversity observed after decoding a rate-@xmath16 linear code transmitted over a @xmath1 channel is upper - bounded by @xmath21 where @xmath7 is given by the following inequalities : @xmath22 and @xmath20 is achievable for any systematic linear code .",

    "this means that there always exists two codewords @xmath17 and @xmath18 such that the last @xmath29 bits of @xmath19 are null , and involves that @xmath31 .",
    "let us now suppose that the code is linear and systematic . if the information bits are transmitted on the blocks of highest diversity order and if @xmath32 , the hamming distance after puncturing the last @xmath33 bits remains strictly positive and induces that @xmath34.@xmath35 + it is straightforward to show that the bound on the diversity order applies to any discrete modulation .    as a remark , in order to achieve the upper - bound on the diversity of a block - fading channel , non - zero bits of word @xmath19",

    "coded bits @xmath80 are then interleaved and gray mapped into qam symbols .",

    "the coherent detector at the destination computes an extrinsic information @xmath82 based on the knowledge of @xmath69 , the received vector @xmath64 , and independent _ a priori _",
    "information @xmath83 for all coded bits .",
    "the channel decoder then computes _ a posteriori _ probabilities ( app ) based on the de - interleaved extrinsic information coming from the detector using the forward - backward algorithm @xcite .",
    "the transmitted information rate is equal to @xmath84 bits per channel use , where the cardinality of the qam constellation is @xmath66 .    as a remark ,",
    "one precoded symbol at the output of @xmath81 is transmitted over a row of the channel matrix @xmath69 and thus experiences a set of random variables @xmath85 .",
    "if we assume that the quality of the source to relays and inter - relays links is much better than the source to destination or relay to destination links , we can then focus on the @xmath86 or @xmath87 random variables to understand the diversity behavior of such a system . indeed , in the context of professional relay deployment on top of buildings",
    ", we may assume that the relays are placed and have their antennas tuned to ensure a good link quality with the base station .",
    "furthermore , in the case of detect - and - forward or decode - and - forward protocols , this assumption is still relevant .",
    "finally , one precoded symbol transmitted on the @xmath7-th row of the channel matrix sees a set of @xmath88 fading variables included in the set seen by a symbol sent on the @xmath89-th row .",
    "hence , we will see in the sequel that the equivalent channels obtained by the use of a sequential slotted amplify and forward protocol fall into the class of matryoshka channels .",
    "the maximum diversity inherent to the ssaf channel is @xmath91 , and it can be collected by an app detector ( at the destination ) if a full - diversity linear precoder is used at the transmitter .",
    "the precoder mixes the @xmath90 constellation symbols being transmitted on the channel providing full diversity with uncoded systems and without increasing the complexity at the detector . using precoders that process spreading among more than @xmath90 time slots",
    "can further improve the performance . from an algebraic point of view , a linear precoder of size @xmath92 is the optimal configuration to achieve good coding gains ( without channel coding ) @xcite at the price of an increase in detection complexity ( the complexity of an exhaustive app detector grows exponentially with the number of dimensions ) .",
    "on the other hand , for coded systems transmitted on block - fading channels , the channel decoder is capable of collecting a certain amount of diversity that is however limited by the singleton bound @xcite . in @xcite@xcite ,",
    "the modified singleton bound taking into account the rotation size over a mimo block - fading channel is used to achieve the best tradeoff between complexity and diversity .",
    "for this purpose , we derive hereafter an upper - bound on the diversity order of a coded transmission over a precoded @xmath90-slot ssaf channel , and then deduce the precoding strategy to follow in order to achieve full diversity .",
    "we will first assume that the interleaver of the bicm is ideal , which means that for any pair of codewords @xmath93 , the @xmath94 non - zero bits of @xmath19 are transmitted in different blocks of @xmath95 time periods , which means that no inter - slot inter - bit interference is experienced .",
    "the interleaving , modulation and transmission through the channel convert the codewords @xmath17 and @xmath18 onto points @xmath96 and @xmath97 in a euclidean space . for a fixed channel , the performance",
    "is directly linked to the euclidean squared distance @xmath98 , that can be rewritten as a sum of @xmath94 squared euclidean distances associated to the @xmath94 non - zero bits of @xmath19 .",
    "for each of the @xmath94 squared euclidean distances , we can build an equivalent channel model which corresponds to the transmission of a bpsk modulation over one row of the channel matrix @xmath99 .",
    "thus , several squared euclidean distances appear to be transmitted on the same equivalent channel and the squared distance @xmath98 can be factorized as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is linearly dependent on the norm of the @xmath102-th row of @xmath99 .    in other words , at the output of the app detector ,",
    "an equivalent block - fading channel is observed and the constituent blocks do not have the same intrinsic diversity order : a soft output belonging to the @xmath103-th block carries the attenuation coefficients @xmath104 . as a remark ,",
    "blocks are sorted such that the @xmath103-th block carries a diversity order of @xmath105 and the subset of realizations of random variables observed in the @xmath7-th row of @xmath99 is included in the subset of random variables observed in the @xmath89-th row of @xmath99 . as the same modulation is used on each time slot of the relaying protocol",

    ", we can conclude that the upper - bound on the diversity order of a non - precoded ssaf channel is @xmath109 which is equal to the classical singleton bound on the diversity order of block - fading channels @xcite , with the difference that it can be achieved by any systematic code .      for the sake of generalization",
    ", we now suppose that modulations with different spectral efficiencies are sent over the @xmath90 slots of the cooperation frame .",

    "it is also clear that higher coding rates than in ( [ d1 ] ) can be attained for a given target diversity .",
    "however , the bound on the diversity does not give any information on the coding gain of the coded scheme .",
    "we will see later that a fine tuning of the choice of the spectral efficiencies might be needed to optimize the coding gain .",
    "for example , the orthogonal amplify - and - forward protocol leads to @xmath115 , which provides full diversity whatever the code rate is but exhibits a poor coding gain @xcite .",
    "let us now introduce a linear precoder that rotates symbols of @xmath116 different diversity blocks together .",
    "first of all , let us focus on two different scenarios :    * the linear precoder size is lower than ( or equal to ) @xmath90 . in this case",
    ", the dimension of the received vector @xmath64 remains unchanged , thus there is no increase in detection complexity when an exhaustive app detector is used , and no delay is introduced to the protocol .",
    "the authors in @xcite considered the design of such precoders for uncoded systems . *",
    "the linear precoder size is lower than ( or equal to ) @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is the delay ( i.e. the source broadcasts for @xmath119 time slots before the relays start to cooperate ) . in this case",
    ", the complexity of the detector increases exponentially with @xmath118 .",
    "as mentionned previously , these precoders are mandatory to achieve optimal performance for uncoded systems . as we focus on channel coding issues in this work , delay - precoders",
    "will not be considered in the sequel .",

    "unfortunately , the theoretical of coding gains for coded modulations on block fading channels is difficult and often by extensive computer simulations .",

    "it is then clear that this protocol allows to achieve full diversity with higher coding rates . in the sequel",
