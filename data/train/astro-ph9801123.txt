    "the evidence for the existence of dark matter is clear in a great variety of data ( trimble 1987 ) .",
    "these include the oort discrepancy in the disk of the milky way ( kuijken & gilmore 1989 ; bahcall 1992 ) , the velocity dispersions of dwarf spheroidal galaxies ( vogt 1995 ) , the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies ( rubin 1980 ; bosma 1981 ) , the statistics of satellite galaxy orbits ( zaritsky & white 1994 ) , the timing argument in the local group ( kahn & woltjer 1959 ) , the velocity dispersions of clusters of galaxies ( zwicky & humason 1964 ) , bulk flows on large scales ( lynden - bell 1988 ; mould 1993 ) , the excess of mass density in the universe over that in visible in galaxies ( @xmath1 ; ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) , and gravitational lensing ( tyson 1990 ) .",
    "what these data really demonstrate is that the observed distribution of luminous matter together with the usual dynamical equations can not reproduce the observations .",
    "this can be interpreted _ either _ to require dark matter , _ or _ as a need to modify the equations we use ( the law of gravity ) . in this series of papers we examine and compare the pros and cons of both alternatives . here",
    "we shall examine the dark matter hypothesis . in companion papers [",
    "mcgaugh & de blok 1998 ( paper ii ) ; de blok & mcgaugh 1998 ( paper iii ) ] , we examine alternative dynamical theories .    the  rotation curves of disk galaxies provide powerful tests of the various hypotheses ( kent 1987 ; begeman 1991 ) .",
    "these share the general characteristic of becoming asymptotically _ flat _ at large radii .",
    "one would expect @xmath2 without dark matter .",
    "the major advantage of using  rotation curves is that the geometry of the orbits is obvious .",
    "dissipation in the gas enforces circular orbits .",
    "thus it is possible to directly equate the centripetal acceleration @xmath3 with the gravitational acceleration @xmath4 determined from the poisson equation @xmath5 in order to predict the expected form of the rotation curve @xmath6 from any given mass distribution @xmath7 . in no other type of system",
    "are tests so direct and free of assumptions .",
    "an important aspect of any test is probing a large dynamic range in the relevant parameters .",
    "it turns out that the luminous surface density of disks is a critical parameter ( see  4 ) .",
    "so the important thing is to have a large dynamic range in surface brightness .",
    "this is exemplified by the fact that the few good rotation curves of low surface brightness dwarf galaxies which exist are constantly being reanalyzed ( flores & primack 1994 ; moore 1994 ) precisely because they provide leverage for testing ideas principally motivated by data for high surface brightness ( hsb ) spirals . here",
    ", we augment existing data with our own data for low surface brightness ( lsb ) disk galaxies ( van der hulst 1993 ; de blok etal 1996 ) to probe the lower extremes of surface brightness with many more galaxies than previously available thus extending the dynamic range in the critical parameter of luminous surface density .    one important result is the universality of the tully - fisher relation across this increased dynamic range in surface brightness ( zwaan 1995 ; sprayberry 1995 ) .",
    "this requires a surprising fine - tuning between the optical properties ( central surface brightness ) of a galaxy and its halo ( mass - to - light ratio ) .",
    "zwaan ( 1995 ) suggested that galaxies must become progressively more dark matter dominated towards lower surface brightnesses .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by  rotation curves ( de blok 1996 ) which require a greater ratio of dark to luminous mass at any given radius in lsb relative to hsb galaxies ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "another essential result is the way in which the shape of rotation curves changes systematically with surface brightness from steeply rising curves in hsb galaxies to slowly rising curves in lsb galaxies .",
    "the challenge is to fit these and other observations into a consistent and coherent picture of the formation and evolution of dark matter halos and their associated spiral disks . in this paper",
    "we examine the difficulties encountered in undertaking this task . as",
    "yet , it is impossible to develop such a picture without resorting to a large number of fine - tuned relations between supposedly independent galaxy properties .    in section 2",
    ", we describe the data . in section 3 , we define symbols and clarify terms .",
    "section 4 gives a summary of the most relevant empirical facts .",
    "the physical interpretation of the tully - fisher relation is discussed in  5 . in  6 we introduce and test a variety of galaxy formation models .",
    "section 7 tests various dark matter candidates and  8 discusses the implications of baryon fractions determined from a variety of data .",
    "we adopt a hubble constant of @xmath8 throughout .",
    "we employ data we have obtained for low surface brightness disk galaxies in the 21 cm line as described in van der hulst ( 1993 ) and de blok ( 1996 ) , combined with optical surface photometry presented in those papers and in mcgaugh & bothun ( 1994 ) and de blok ( 1995 ) .",
    "we augment our own data with published data for dwarfs and high surface brightness spirals for which both 21 cm rotation curves and adequate surface photometry are available , as compiled by broeils ( 1992 ) and de blok ( 1996 ) .",
    "the data are listed in table  1 .",
    "the line demarcates our own data from that drawn from the literature .",
    "the columns give ( 1 ) the name of the galaxy , ( 2 ) its @xmath9-band absolute magnitude @xmath10 , ( 3 ) the inclination corrected central surface brightness   the disk in @xmath11 , ( 4 ) the scale length of the disk @xmath12 in kpc , ( 5 ) the circular velocity @xmath13 in the flat part of the rotation curve , ( 6 ) the inclination @xmath14 in degrees , and ( 7 ) the dynamical mass to light ratio  measured at @xmath15 in @xmath16 ( see  3 ) .",
    "a requirement for inclusion in table 1 is that both an  rotation curve and surface photometry exist .",
    "most data of the latter sort are in @xmath9 so we use that as standard .",
    "though @xmath17 or even @xmath18 might seem preferable , this severely reduces the amount of available data .",
    "the choice of bandpass makes no difference to the interpretation . in collecting data from the literature",
    ", we have attempted to be as inclusive as possible , in some cases transforming photographic surface photometry from different bands to @xmath9 when a color is available .",
    "we correct optical surface brightnesses to face - on values assuming that the disk is optically thin .",
    "this is supported by statistical studies which show that spiral galaxies are semi - transparent throughout their disks , except for the innermost regions ( huizinga & van albada 1992 ; giovanelli 1994 ) . in general the outer parts of galaxies",
    "are optically thin .",
    "measurements of extinction in foreground spirals obscuring a background galaxy suggest extinction values of @xmath19 0.3 mag in @xmath9 in the interarm regions of the outer parts of a spiral ( andredakis & van der kruit 1992 ; white & keel 1992 ) . as  is not a measure of the actual surface brightness in the center of a galaxy , but the intercept of a fit to the disk profile which depends more on the outer than the inner points , extinction is not a serious concern .",
    "this is especially true in lsb galaxies where the metallicity and dust content are low ( mcgaugh 1994 ) .",
    "the assumption of optically thin disks is only likely to be invalid in edge - on galaxies .",
    "bulges have little effect on the derived  of lsb galaxies ( mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ; de blok 1995 ; see also de jong 1996a ; courteau 1996 ) .",
    "a bigger problem is the great inhomogeneity of sources of the surface photometry amongst the literature data .",
    "however , the range is surface brightness in our sample ( @xmath20 ) is much larger than the most pessimistic error estimates on the surface brightnesses .",
    "sometimes , the rotation curves themselves are lacking . for completeness , we published all our synthesis data in de blok ( 1996 ) , but not all galaxies are useful for dynamical analyses ( table  2 ) .",
    "we observed galaxies of a variety of inclinations , and some are too face - on to be of use here .",
    "we nonetheless prefer to accept large errors than to arbitrarily limit the data , and so impose a very liberal inclination limit : @xmath21 .    as well as very face - on galaxies , there are lsb galaxies with such slowly rising rotation curves that even the synthesis observations do not reach the flat portion of the rotation curve . in others , substantial asymmetries are present .",
    "this is not an uncommon feature of galaxies generally ( richter & sancisi 1994 ) , and calls into question the assumption of circular orbits on which dynamical analyses are based .",
    "hence these galaxies are also excluded .",
    "the list of excluded galaxies in table  2 is not precisely identical to that for our rotation curve fits ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ; paper iii ) because that is a different sort of analysis .",
    "the fits depend to a large extent on the shape of the rotation curve which can be sensitive to the resolution of the observations .",
    "in this analysis we are only concerned with the amplitude @xmath13 of the rotation curve so we can proceed if @xmath13 is reasonably well defined .",
    "some tests are less sensitive to these limitations than others , so it will sometimes be possible to make use of the galaxies in table  2 . however , unless so noted , the sample is restricted to those galaxies listed in table  1 .",
    "this sample is not complete in any volume - limited sense , but that is not the goal of this work . our aim here is to represent as broad as possible a range of the relevant physical parameters .",
    "the collected data span a factor of 4000 in luminosity , 30 in size , and nearly 100 in surface brightness .",
    "this large dynamic range in surface brightness with good sampling of the lsb regime is the essence of the new contribution of this work .",
    "here we explicitly define the symbols and notation we will use .",
    "the optical luminosity of a galaxy will be denoted in the usual way by @xmath22 and the corresponding absolute magnitude by @xmath23 , where @xmath24 denotes the relevant band pass . unless otherwise specified , all optical quantities are @xmath9-band measurements . to symbolically distinguish between absolute magnitude and mass , the latter",
    "will be denoted by .",
    "the light distribution of an exponential disk is characterized by the central surface brightness  and the scale length @xmath12 ( de vaucouleurs 1959 ) .",
    "as the intercept and slope of a fit to the light profile , these describe the global luminous surface density and size of disks .",
    "it is sometimes convenient to discuss surface brightness in , and sometimes in linear units .",
    "in general , we will use @xmath25 to specify a surface brightness , @xmath26 to specify a luminous surface density , and @xmath27 to specify a mass surface density .",
    "the total luminosity of the disk component is of course simply related to the disk parameters by @xmath28 .",
    "an important quantity is the mass to light ratio , which we will denote by @xmath29 .",
    "we need to distinguish several different mass to light ratios :    1 .   , the total mass to light ratio , 2 .   , the observable dynamical mass to light ratio , and 3 .   , the mass to light ratio of the stars .",
    "the latter relates stellar mass to observable luminosity ; it includes any remnants that occur in the natural course of stellar evolution ( white dwarfs ) but not baryons in the gas phase . the total mass to light ratio  includes all mass , and encompasses the entirety of any halo . since @xmath30 for a flat rotation curve , and there exists no clear evidence of an edge to any halo mass distribution ,  is a purely theoretical construct .",
    "it is nonetheless useful to keep in mind when discussing the observable mass to light ratio .",
    "this includes all mass ( including dark matter ) within some finite observable radius @xmath31 .",
    "for the usual assumption of sphericity , the mass within @xmath31 is @xmath32 deviations from sphericity can complicate this equation , but only by geometrical factors .",
    "they do not alter the basic functional dependence which is the issue of relevance here .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is known and @xmath34 , @xmath17 and @xmath35 are directly measured .",
    "the quantities @xmath36 and  are thus uniquely determined by equation  ( 4 ) .",
    "if  exceeds what is reasonable for , we infer the presence of dark matter .",
    "the absolute mass inferred depends on the distance scale which enters through @xmath17 ( @xmath35 is distance independent for the redshifts that concern us ) .",
    "the choice of @xmath37 is not important to the shape derived for trends of  with optical properties .",
    "the absolute value of  will of course shift with changes to the distance scale .",
    "the choice of @xmath31 is important .",
    "it is tempting simply to take this as the largest radius measured .",
    "however , this depends more on the details of the observations than anything intrinsic to a galaxy .",
    "it is therefore necessary to make a sensible choice for @xmath31 which can systematically be applied to all disk galaxies .",
    "since @xmath38 as @xmath17 becomes large , one obvious stipulation is that @xmath31 be sufficiently large that the rotation curves have become essentially flat .",
    "the rotation curves of lsb galaxies are observed to rise slowly ( de blok 1996 ) , and in some cases the flat portion has not yet been reached at the last measured point .",
    "these galaxies must be excluded from analysis . in most cases ,",
    "the rotation curves are still rising slightly but becoming asymptotically flat .",
    "we proceed if the gradient in the outer slope is small ( following broeils 1992 ; see fig .",
    "11 of de blok 1996 ) .",
    "the actual observed value is used , not the apparent asymptotic value .",
    "another stipulation in defining @xmath31 is that it contain essentially all of the luminosity of the galaxy , so that  has the obvious meaning .",
    "a further requirement is that @xmath31 not be so large as to exceed the last measured point of the observations .",
    "ideally , we would like to relate @xmath31 to the extent of the mass distribution .",
    "presumably dark halos have some sort of edge , which we will denote by @xmath39 . since we can not see the dark matter , it is impossible to relate @xmath31 to @xmath39 without somehow assuming the answer .",
    "observations are incapable of uniquely deconvolving the contribution of luminous and dark mass into any useful scale radius ( van albada & sancisi 1986 ; lake & feinswog 1989 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "the only fair measure of a disk s size observationally available is the scale length @xmath12 .",
    "isophotal radii like @xmath40 are meaningless for lsb galaxies : the dimmest objects studied here have @xmath41 , so @xmath42 by definition .",
    "the effective ( half light ) radius is proportional to the scale length for pure disk systems , but depends on the bulge component in general .",
    "we are concerned here with defining a radius for the rotating disk , so the scale length is preferable to the effective radius .",
    "it might seem preferable to define a half mass radius of the observable matter by combining stars and gas .",
    "however , this requires that molecular gas be mapped as well as the  and optical light .",
    "even if such data were available , some assumption about  and the @xmath43 conversion factor would still have to be made .",
    "we therefore choose to define @xmath31 in units of @xmath12 , in particular @xmath44 .",
    "most rotation curves have reached their asymptotic velocities by 3 scale lengths , while the last measured point for the bulk of the data is around @xmath45 .",
    "four scale lengths contains 91% of the luminosity of a pure exponential disk extrapolated to infinity , and disks are generally thought to truncate around 4 or 5 scale lengths ( van der kruit 1987 ) . a choice of @xmath45 , or any other definition based on the disk light distribution , simply inserts a multiplicative factor .    as a matter of nomenclature",
    ", we will refer to the observable gas and stars as `` baryonic '' matter , and treat the dark matter as a distinct component of unknown composition .",
    "empirical results about the rotation curves and what they imply for the dependence of the mass discrepancy on the optical properties of galaxies can be summarized independently of any theoretical framework by the following four facts :    1 .",
    "all disk galaxies obey the same tully - fisher relation , irrespective of surface brightness or band pass ( fig .  1 ; sprayberry 1995 ; zwaan 1995 ; hoffman 1996 ; tully & verheijen 1997 )",
    ". 2 .   at a given luminosity ,",
    "the shape of rotation curves @xmath6 varies systematically with surface brightness ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "when @xmath17 is measured in physical units ( kpc ) , lower surface brightness galaxies have rotation curves which rise more gradually .",
    "when @xmath17 is measured in terms of disk scale lengths , the shape of @xmath46 is more similar though not necessarily identical ( see fig .",
    "8 of de blok 1996 ) .",
    "3 .   the mass discrepancy manifests itself at progressively smaller radii in dimmer galaxies ( de blok & mcgaugh 1996 , 1997 ; fig .  3 ; see also casertano & van gorkom 1991 ; broeils 1992 ; van zee 1997 ) .",
    "the severity of the mass discrepancy is strongly correlated with the central surface brightness of the disk ( fig .  4 ; de blok 1996 ) .",
    "this is the @xmath29-@xmath26 relation ( zwaan 1995 ) .",
    "the relationship between luminosity and linewidth has long been known ( tully & fisher 1977 ) . that the same relation holds for all surface brightnesses has been obtained independently by sprayberry ( 1995 ) , zwaan ( 1995 ) , hoffman 1996 , and tully & verheijen 1997 .",
    "these different works all obtain the same observational result but offer varying interpretations of it .",
    "the interpretation depends entirely on the basic assumptions one must make .",
    "one obvious assumption is that light traces mass , in which case lsb galaxies should rotate slowly for their luminosity and _ not _ obey the tully - fisher relation .",
    "this occurs because @xmath17 is larger for the same @xmath34 , reducing @xmath35 in equation  ( 4 ) ( zwaan 1995 ) . that lsb galaxies are not expected to fall on the tully - fisher relation was first discussed by aaronson ( 1979 ) and romanishin ( 1982 ) using this assumption .",
    "other assumptions can also be made ( discussed in detail  5 ) but generally result in some sort of shift of lsb galaxies off the tully - fisher relation ( dalcanton 1995 ) .",
    "the only scenario in which no shift is expected is one in which halos of a given mass are identical .",
    "this assumption is itself motivated by the tully - fisher relation , so it offers no independent expectation value . in cases where there is a clear expectation of a shift ,",
    "that expectation is not realized .",
    "indeed , it is already difficult to understand a luminosity - linewidth relation with little scatter .",
    "one expects a great deal more scatter for plausible initial conditions ( eisenstein & loeb 1995 ) .",
    "the lack of surface brightness segregation in the luminosity - linewidth plane complicates things much further ( as discussed in  5 ) . for now , note that in fig .  1",
    "a tully - fisher relation is obtained for both @xmath47 and @xmath13 : the velocity width is as expected an indicator of the rotation velocity .",
    "the scatter is greater when the linewidth is used ( 0.9 0.6 mag . ) .",
    "we can not say much about the intrinsic scatter of the tully - fisher relation since we include low inclination galaxies .",
    "this naturally increases the scatter , so the intrinsic scatter is presumably smaller than what we measure .",
    "the slopes obtained from fig  1(a ) and ( b ) are marginally different , being @xmath48 in ( a ) and @xmath49 in ( b ) .",
    "this may indicate that @xmath47 is not a perfect indicator of the real quantity of interest , @xmath13 .",
    "the most important fact is that there is a strong luminosity - rotation velocity relation with little intrinsic scatter and a slope indistinguishable from the theoretical value .",
    "the details of the band - pass dependence of the slope are not critical ( see appendix ) as we are not trying to establish a calibration of the tully - fisher relation , but rather trying to understand why lsb galaxies follow it at all . in this context",
    ", we are concerned with the relation of stellar _ mass _ to the flat rotation velocity @xmath13 .",
    "the near infrared is thought to be the best indicator of stellar mass , and both @xmath50 ( aaronson 1979 ) and @xmath18 ( tully & verheijen 1997 ) band tully - fisher relations have slopes indistinguishable from the theoretical expectation @xmath51 .",
    "it is well known that the shape of galaxy rotation curves is luminosity dependent ( burstein 1982 ; persic 1996 ) . at a given luminosity ,",
    "the shape varies systematically with surface brightness in that the rotation curves of lsb galaxies rise more gradually than do those of high surface brightness galaxies .",
    "this behavior _ is _ expected if light traces mass and surface mass density follows from surface brightness in the obvious way .",
    "this is indeed the case at small radii , both for the specific example illustrated in fig .  2 ( de blok & mcgaugh 1996a ) and in general .",
    "moreover , the relative similarity of @xmath46 suggests that the dark halo is strongly coupled to the properties of the disk ( see also paper ii ) .",
    "if surface brightness is a good indicator of mass density , lsb galaxies should not lie on the tully - fisher relation .",
    "yet they do . reconciling facts ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) proves to be very difficult , and leads to fact ( 3 ) .      in high surface brightness spiral galaxies , it is generally possible to attribute essentially all of the observed rotation to the luminous disk out to 3 scale lengths or so by scaling the disk contribution up to the maximum value allowed by the amplitude of the inner part of the rotation curve ( bosma 1981 ; kent 1987 ; sancisi & van albada 1987 ; sanders 1990 ) .",
    "this `` maximum disk '' solution has led to a general picture in which the luminous material dominates the inner part of spiral galaxies , and dark matter only becomes dominant in the outer fringes near the edge of the luminous disk .",
    "an important aspect of this picture is that the peak in the rotation curve of the exponential disk at @xmath52 is comparable in amplitude to the circular velocity due to the halo [ @xmath53 , giving a smooth transition between the two components ( the disk - halo `` conspiracy '' ) .",
    "the disks of lsb spirals can not be maximal in this sense . because they are very diffuse , the newtonian rotation curves of lsb disks peak at very low amplitudes ( @xmath54 ) for plausible values of the mass to light ratio of the stellar population . from a purely dynamical standpoint",
    ", there is some room to consider values of  which are unreasonably large for the blue stellar populations of lsb galaxies .",
    "however , even for @xmath55 ( as opposed to reasonable values of @xmath56 or 2 ) , it is still not possible to attribute a velocity comparable to @xmath13 to the disk .",
    "even larger  are not allowed by the slow rate of rise of the rotation curves .",
    "the disk simply can not dominate in these galaxies except at very small radii : the mass discrepancy sets in at essentially @xmath0 ( fig .",
    "only the highest surface brightness disks can be maximal in the sense that luminous disks dominates the inner dynamics , with dark matter only becoming important at large radii .",
    "there is no reason to believe that a segregation between inner dominance by a disk and outer dominance by a dark matter halo is a general property of galaxies .",
    "the severity of the global mass discrepancy , as measured by the observed mass to light ratio , is correlated with both luminosity and surface brightness ( fig .",
    "it is not correlated with the optical size of the galaxy .",
    "the correlation with surface brightness is much stronger ( @xmath57 ) than with absolute magnitude ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the scatter in the former case can plausibly be attributed entirely to observational error , especially considering the very inhomogeneous sources of the surface photometry . in the case of @xmath10",
    "there is substantial real scatter .",
    "absolute magnitude and surface brightness are themselves weakly correlated ( @xmath59 in this sample ) , so it seems likely that the relation between luminosity and  is due to the convolution of the strong -  relation with the lack of a size relation through @xmath60 .",
    "surface brightness , not luminosity or morphological type , is the variable of greatest interest .",
    "the relation between  and  can be derived from the tully - fisher relation ( zwaan 1995 ) assuming that the observed velocity width @xmath61 is proportional to the asymptotic rotation velocity @xmath13 , and taking @xmath62 .",
    "the latter is true by definition ; the former is empirically confirmed by the full rotation curve data .",
    "various authors ( sprayberry 1995 ; salpeter & hoffman 1996 ) give apparently conflicting results , but these stem entirely from differing definitions of @xmath31 .",
    "the _ data _ are all consistent .    to discuss possible interpretations of the tully - fisher relation , we make the usual assumptions that the  gas is in circular orbit ( @xmath63 ) and that halos are spherical and dominant where @xmath38 so that @xmath64 . setting @xmath65 gives @xmath66 these are very basic assumptions which are widely employed ; plausible deviations ( triaxial halos ) will not alter the gist of the results .",
    "observationally , the tully - fisher relation is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the slope in band pass @xmath69 . to relate equation ( 5 ) to ( 6 ) ,",
    "let us define a mass surface density @xmath70 and make a substitution of variables so that @xmath71 by definition , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "here , @xmath74 is the average surface brightness within @xmath17 ( which will decrease as @xmath17 grows ) and @xmath75 is the dynamical mass to light ratio within radius @xmath17 .",
    "both @xmath76 and @xmath77 are strong functions of @xmath17 .",
    "however , we are concerned only with the relative functional dependencies , so the actual value of @xmath17 drops out where @xmath78 .",
    "in theory , @xmath79 while in actuality @xmath80 as discussed by zwaan ( 1995 ) , one needs to arrange to keep the term @xmath81 constant in order to recover the observed tully - fisher relation from basic physics .",
    "this is often attributed to a universal constancy of the mass to light ratio and freeman s law ( freeman 1970 ) which states that all spirals have essentially the same surface brightness , @xmath82 . by definition",
    "lsb galaxies deviate from this value , and _ should not _ fall on the same tully - fisher relation as freeman disks if the mass to light ratio is constant as generally assumed .",
    "5 shows the relation expected from equation  ( 9 ) if @xmath83 is constant ; the range of surface brightnesses examined is large enough that this effect would be very readily apparent . instead of following this relation ,",
    "lsb galaxies rigorously adhere to _ the _ tully - fisher relation .",
    "the mass to light ratio must somehow be fine tuned to compensate .",
    "consider the error budget required . in magnitude units ,",
    "the tully - fisher relation is @xmath84 assuming @xmath85 .",
    "hence @xmath86 so an intrinsic scatter of @xmath87 mag",
    ".  stems from a modest @xmath88 intrinsic variation in @xmath13 .",
    "disk and halo must combine to specify @xmath13 very precisely .",
    "more generally , the variation is @xmath89 a one magnitude shift in  should translate directly into one magnitude in @xmath90 . even for disks which obey the freeman ( 1970 ) law ,",
    "the scatter in  ( 0.35 mag . ) should propagate directly into the tully - fisher relation .",
    "here we have disks spanning nearly 5 magnitudes in .",
    "the mass to light ratio must be fine tuned to compensate , with essentially zero scatter .",
    "the observed mass to light ratio  as we have defined it includes all mass within some arbitrary radius @xmath31 .",
    "the exact definition of @xmath31 is not essential , as long as we choose a fixed number of scale lengths which encompasses the luminous matter and reaches the flat part of the rotation curve .",
    "then , using equation  ( 9 ) , @xmath91 where  is the mass to light ratio of the stellar population , @xmath92 is the baryonic mass fraction , @xmath93 is the fraction of baryonic disk mass in the form of stars , and @xmath94 is the fraction of the total mass encompassed by the edge of the disk . note that since @xmath30 , @xmath95 where @xmath39 is the halo radius ( edge ) .",
    "we thus decompose  into four fundamental parameters ; two involve galaxy evolution ( , @xmath96 ) and two involve galaxy formation ( @xmath97 , @xmath98 ) .",
    "the requirement @xmath99 now implies that a combination of four parameters must be fine tuned with surface brightness .",
    "let us examine each of them in turn .",
    "zwaan ( 1995 ) attributed the observed adherence to the tully - fisher relation to evolutionary regulation . from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "not taking the surface brightness effects into account , eisenstein & loeb ( 1995 ) came to the same conclusion in more general terms .",
    "they showed that it was very difficult to obtain a tully - fisher relation with the small observed scatter from plausible initial conditions .",
    "there should always be some scatter in the density structure of halos so that velocity is not so precisely specified by total mass and luminosity .",

    "bottema ( 1997 ) finds @xmath101 from velocity dispersions . for lsb galaxies ,",
    "one infers slightly smaller  from their colors , @xmath56 with great uncertainty ( mcgaugh & bothun 1994 ; de blok 1995 ) .",
    "there is a lot of real scatter in color at any given surface brightness , implying substantial scatter in .",
    "the inferred trend of  with   is much smaller in magnitude than the -  relation and has the opposite sign .",
    "in addition to what the colors imply for , the slow rate of rise of the rotation curves ( de blok & mcgaugh 1996 1997 ) dynamically rules out the large  values that are needed in lsb galaxies to explain the -  relation .",
    "the peak amplitudes of the rotation curves of the stellar disk are much smaller than @xmath13 so the stellar disks alone can not cause the tf relation , let alone the -  fine - tuning . the only way to alter",
    "this conclusion is to drop the usual assumption that light traces _",
    "stellar _ mass , and make  a strong function of radius [ the unlikely form @xmath102 would be required ] .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that the -  relation can be caused by a -  relation .",
    "the fraction of the baryonic disk mass which is in the form of stars @xmath96 _ is _ well correlated with surface brightness ( fig .",

    "the correlation goes in the correct sense , with lsb galaxies having relatively fewer stars .",
    "the slope is approximately correct , though the correlation is not as tight as that with .",
    "it is therefore tempting to attribute the fact that @xmath103 to @xmath104 .",
    "this would mean a regulatory mechanism which somehow maintains a mass fraction of stars appropriate to both the tully - fisher and -@xmath105 relations .",
    "it is possible to check this since the gas mass is directly measurable from the 21 cm flux .",
    "that is , @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is appropriate for solar metallicity atomic gas .",
    "molecular gas does not seem to be common in lsb galaxies ( schombert 1990 ) and is presumably distributed like the stars .",
    "if this is the case , it is subject to the same dynamical constraints as .",

    "evolutionary regulation simply can _ not _ solve the problem .",
    "the evolutionary parameters just discussed fail to have an impact on the problem because lsb galaxies are dark matter dominated throughout .",
    "the evolution of the baryonic disk is almost irrelevant .",
    "this leaves the conditions of formation .      to explain the -  relation using the baryon fraction @xmath97",

    "this is of course just an ad - hoc assumption .",
    "nominally , one would expect a universal baryon fraction with some modest amount of cosmic scatter .",

    "halos of a given @xmath113 may have different baryon fractions , but somehow form larger or smaller disks to counterbalance this .",
    "halos with low @xmath97 must make up the deficiency in luminosity they suffer from low surface brightness by forming larger disks : @xmath114 . why this should be the case is unclear . beyond stating these requirements ,",
    "little can be said because the hypothesized solution is so arbitrary .",
    "the situation is only a little better with @xmath98 . in this case",
    ", the requirement is @xmath115 since @xmath116 , the difference in this case is that the disks of lower surface brightness galaxies stretch further out into their halos .",
    "this has the built - in virtue of explaining the increasing dark matter domination of lower surface brightness disks while keeping the global baryon fraction fixed . in effect",

    "then , if @xmath27 is a constant in equation  ( 8) , the lack of a shift in the tully - fisher relation follows and the -@xmath26 relation just reflects the difference in @xmath117 and @xmath118 . we measure increasing mass to light ratios with decreasing surface brightness because @xmath119 just measures a systematically greater portion of the global : @xmath120 .",
    "a consequence of this approach is that measuring one parameter of the optical light distribution , the central surface brightness , immediately tells one the extent of the dark matter relative to the light .",
    "specifying the distribution of either @xmath98 or @xmath26 immediately determines the distribution of the other . by the variational principle , @xmath121    our parameter @xmath98",

    "because of the stretching imposed by equation  ( 19 ) , the theoretical prediction of the spin distribution needs to be made at quite high resolution in @xmath123 to provide a useful test .",

    "in contrast , putatively high spin lsb galaxies very clearly reside in low density environments ( schombert 1992 ; bothun 1993 ; mo 1994 ) .",

    ", we will assume that the disk is purely exponential .",
    "this is not precisely true of course , but it is an adequate approximation for our purposes .",
    "we will also make the usual assumption that dark matter halos are isothermal spheres .",
    "the density distribution of the dark matter is taken to be @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the core density and @xmath140 is the core radius .",

    "the effects of @xmath39 are not apparent in the collected data .",
    "experimenting with the models indicates that effects due to @xmath39 would be apparent if observations were anywhere near reaching it , so it can be ignored for now .",
    "the rotation curve resulting from this mass distribution is @xmath141 where the asymptotic circular velocity is @xmath142 .",
    "this gives rise to asymptotically flat rotation curves with @xmath143 as @xmath144 .",

    "the other hypothesis is that galaxies of the same mass live in the same halos , but that the relative extent of the disk varies . this is essentially the same as the @xmath98-@xmath26 relation discussed above , and we will refer to this as the `` same halo '' hypothesis , or sh for short . in sh , differences in surface brightness are driven by differences in the spin parameter @xmath98 .    in both cases",
    ", there is a spectrum of masses which are the main factor determining the total luminosity .",
    "the surface brightness is principally determined by @xmath150 and @xmath98 in dd and sh respectively .",
    "this is not to say that mass maps directly to luminosity and @xmath150 or @xmath98 directly to surface brightness , merely that these are the strongest relations . in principle , there are theoretical distribution functions @xmath151 ( mo 1994 ) and @xmath152 ) ( dalcanton 1997 ) which somehow transform to the observable bivariate distribution @xmath153 .",
    "the transformation need not be free of axial twists ; in both cases one expects some weak correlation between luminosity and surface brightness .",
    "a complete theory should convolve the distributions of @xmath113 , @xmath150 , and @xmath98 and incorporate the physics of star formation to obtain luminosity and surface brightness from the calculated baryonic mass distribution .",
    "this is beyond current abilities .",
    "however , we are concerned here merely with establishing a basic expectation for the dependence of @xmath6 on surface brightness . for this simple purpose",

    "principle among these is that the observed surface density of gas and stars is low in lsb galaxies .",
    "this will occur naturally if lsb galaxies arise from low density peaks in the initial fluctuation spectrum . at a given mass",
    ", small @xmath150 peaks will turn around and collapse at a later time .",
    "they should also have a larger virialization radius and hence have a lower density of dark as well as luminous matter . a collapse time which is somewhat later for lsb than hsb galaxies",

    "is often asserted as obvious , and is indeed well motivated by all the physical properties of lsb galaxies ( colors , metallicities , and gas contents ) as well as actual densities ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "the dd hypothesis makes three important predictions which have subsequently been tested .",
    "one is that lsb galaxies should be less strongly clustered than hsb galaxies .",
    "there should be a shift in the amplitude of the correlation function @xmath155 by an amount corresponding to the difference in the amplitudes of the perturbations @xmath150 from which the galaxies arose .",
    "this was confirmed by mo ( 1994 ) .",
    "the second prediction is that lsb galaxies should have slowly rising rotation curves , in qualitative agreement with the data .",

    "an additional environmental effect must be invoked to produce this .",
    "whatever mechanism causes lsb galaxies to be isolated must be quite strong , as their isolation is clear out to @xmath157 mpc ( bothun 1993 ) .",
    "this is much too large a range for tidal forces to be effective , especially as the dark matter domination of lsb galaxies makes them quite robust against even strong tidal encounters ( mihos 1997 ) .",
    "yet so compelling is the constraint imposed by the tully - fisher relation that a number of models for the formation of lsb galaxies have already appeared which are primarily motivated by this observation ( dalcanton 1997 ; navarro 1996a ) . though more complicated than our illustrative sh model , these models reduce to the same basic scenario , and enjoy the same virtues and suffer the same vices as sh .",

    "we assume the disks are maximal with @xmath159 , as suggested by the disk - halo conspiracy .",

    "we assume that the mass of the hsb and lsb galaxy are the same , both disk and halo , so that the baryon fraction is the same .",
    "the same disk mass imposes the requirement that @xmath162 be the same .",
    "this gives the scaling required to calculate the rotation curves under each hypothesis .",

    "the sh model has the correct @xmath13 ( indeed , it was constructed to do just this ) , but predicts that @xmath6 should rise much more rapidly than it actually does . to be consistent with observations , the halos of lsb galaxies must indeed by more diffuse ( the basis of the dd model ) .",
    "yet somehow they must also attain the @xmath13 dictated by the tully - fisher relation ( the basis of sh ) .",
    "neither dd nor sh alone adequately explain the observations .",
    "it seems that some hybrid is required .",
    "perhaps a convolution of the @xmath150 and @xmath98 distributions is needed , with both initial density and spin contributing to determine the surface brightness . indeed",
    ", a proper theory should account for both effects ; these simple models assume one or the other dominates .",
    "the hybrid approach has its own problems . to match the environments of lsb galaxies and the slow rate of rise of their rotation curves",
    ", dd must make a substantial contribution to the hybrid . however , any mixing of dd with sh degrades the latter s ability to explain the tully - fisher relation",
    ". a perceptible shift in the normalization with surface brightness would be introduced , and the scatter would increase .",
    "having argued that neither model nor a hybrid is adequate , we note that the dd model was able to explain many of the observations of lsb galaxy densities and ages , and did successfully predict the slow rate of rise of lsb galaxy rotation curves and the shift in the correlation function ( table  3 ) .",
    "yet it is made very implausible by lsb galaxies obeying the tully - fisher relation .",
    "why a model should be successful in many respects and yet fail on one important point is a puzzle . but fail it does , so in the following section we examine more elaborate models to see if they fare any better .",
    "until now , we have intentionally kept our models simple so that genuine predictions can be identified and tested .",

    "this is the same problem already discussed for @xmath98-@xmath26 in  5.2 and fig .",

    "the predictions of dalcanton ( 1997 ) are reproduced together with the available data ( as per mcgaugh 1996a ) in fig .",
    "the model overpredicts the luminosity density in hsb galaxies just as it overpredicts their number .",
    "it also overpredicts the luminosity density due to lsb galaxies . the predicted distribution is broad and continuous unlike the sharp featured @xmath171 which is observed .",
    "however , the disagreement at the faint end is not terribly severe , so the model might be salvaged by imposing a cut off at the bright end .",
    "disk stability might provide such a mechanism , since at some high surface density , disk self gravity will become so dominant that the usual instabilities set in .",
    "a stronger test is provided by the shape of the rotation curves .",
    "the model makes specific choices for the baryon fraction and mass to light ratio which need not be precisely correct . to circumvent this and obtain a test which is independent of these assumptions , we use the information provided by fig .  1 of dalcanton ( 1997 ) to construct directly observable quantities . for each model of a given mass and spin ( @xmath172 )",
    ", we extract the disk scale length @xmath12 and the radius @xmath173 where @xmath174 .",
    "these can be combined to give a dimensionless ratio @xmath175 which measures the rate of rise of the rotation curve independent of most model assumptions and directly is relatable to observations .",
    "the choice of @xmath175 is motivated by fig .",
    "9 , which shows that the rate of rise of the inner portion of @xmath6 provides the most sensitive test of sh models .",

    "the data and model predictions are plotted in fig .",
    "the rate of rise of @xmath46 is clearly correlated with both luminosity and surface brightness in the sense that brighter galaxies have more rapidly rising rotation curves .",
    "the correlation with absolute magnitude is particularly clear , consistent with other work ( persic 1996 ) .",
    "this is not to say that we confirm the precise functional form persic ( 1996 ) suggest for the `` universal rotation curve , '' but it is true that to first order luminosity is a good predictor of the shape of @xmath46 . as with the tully - fisher relation , the same result applies to both hsb and lsb galaxies , and is not a selection effect stemming from samples limited only to one or the other .    also shown in fig .",

    "could be helped by using isothermal halos rather than hernquist or navarro profiles as has been done . however",
    ", this provides an additional parameter , the core radius .",
    "it is @xmath140 which controls the shape of rotation curves ( equation  21 ) , so it will always be possible to obtain an adequate solution by making @xmath140 an appropriate function of @xmath10 .",
    "the challenge then is to understand why halos have finite core radii contrary to the expectations of many numerical simulations ( dubinski & carlberg 1991 ; navarro 1996 ; cole & lacey 1996 ) , and additionally why @xmath140 assumes the particular value required at each @xmath10 ( casertano & van gorkom 1991 ) .    flores ( 1993 ) describe a @xmath123 model which employs isothermal halos .",
    "they predict how the outer slope of rotation curves should depend on @xmath123 ( their figs .  5 and 6c ) which should lead to a segregation of the data by surface brightness in these plots .",
    "this is not apparent in our data , but the predicted amplitude of the effect is too small relative to the uncertainties for this to provide a useful test .",
    "we can note that , by their own stipulation , the model of flores ( 1993 ) is only viable for a fairly narrow range of parameters : @xmath179 and @xmath180 .",
    "the truncation radius @xmath181 is the radius beyond which no baryonic infall occurs .",
    "the low required baryon fraction is not consistent with that determined from clusters of galaxies ( evrard 1996 ) ; they can not both be correct . in the context of lsb galaxies the required truncation radius @xmath181 seems to be too small .",
    "flores ( 1993 ) state that the cooling time places an upper limit on the truncation radius so that @xmath182 for a galaxy like malin 1 , this gives @xmath183 kpc which is only one disk scale length ( bothun 1987 ) .",
    "the disk extends much further than this , and the baryons should have originated at even larger radii in this sort of collapse model . though malin 1 is an extreme example and equation  ( 23 ) is subject to modification , the problem is generic to lsb galaxies .",
    "upper limits on their baryon fractions (  7.2 ; de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) are comparable to the value @xmath184 preferred by flores ( 1993 ) .",
    "this means either that the true @xmath97 is much lower than tolerable , or that lsb galaxies have collapsed so little that they sample the initial baryon fraction : @xmath185 .",
    "this implies very high spin , @xmath186 .",
    "the highest spin considered in any model is around @xmath187 .",
    "since sophisticated models are unable to explain any more than the simple dd and sh models , one wonders if perhaps the answer lies in the complex interplay between dark matter , gas hydrodynamics , and star formation during galaxy formation .",
    "a fundamental assumption of @xmath123 models is that angular momentum is conserved and not transferred between dark and luminous components .",
    "numerical models indicate that angular momentum transfer does indeed occur ( katz & gunn 1991 ) .",
    "there has been a great deal of progress on numerical models which incorporate hydrodynamics .",
    "one promising example which makes testable predictions for galaxies is that of cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) .",
    "their fig .",
    "3 predicts the trend of total mass and cold gas mass with stellar mass , and is reproduced here in fig .",
    "13 together with the data .",
    "the data are plotted in fig .",
    "13(a ) assuming @xmath188 and for a dynamical mass within a radius of @xmath189 .",
    "the precise value assumed for  makes no difference on this logarithmic plot which spans many decades .",
    "a different choice for @xmath17 simply translates the dynamical mass vertically .",
    "the trend predicted by cen & ostriker ( 1993 ) qualitatively mimics that of fig .",
    "however , they predict a much stronger change of @xmath190 with @xmath191 than is actually observed .",
    "the difference between the slope of the data and that of the line of constant @xmath97 is barely perceptible .",
    "presumably , halos extend further than @xmath189 .",
    "some of the data could be shifted into agreement with the models by an appropriate choice of @xmath17 , but not all of it at once .",
    "this could only be done by forcing @xmath39 to be an appropriate function of @xmath191 , by inserting the answer .",
    "unfortunately , there is no test here .",
    "the simulations predict @xmath190 but not @xmath192 , while observations can only probe the latter .",
    "there is a test in the other panel of fig .  3 of cen & ostriker ( 1993 )",
    "this is a prediction of the cold gas mass as a function of stellar mass , and is reproduced in fig .",
    "this is an important test of any hydrodynamical model which attempts to model the gastrophysics of galaxy formation .",
    "data for spiral galaxies are taken from mcgaugh & de blok ( 1997 ) , and that for elliptical galaxies from wiklind ( 1995 ) with  computed following the relation of van der marel ( 1991 ) .",
    "the model prediction is orthogonal to the data , and off by five orders of magnitude at the bright end .",
    "it would appear that numerical models are as yet a long way from producing realistic galaxies ( see also navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "the fundamental problem is this : one needs pieces of both the dd and sh models , yet grafting them together always results in a serious fine - tuning conspiracy .",
    "recall that @xmath193 . to satisfy the tully - fisher relation ( fact 1 ) , @xmath13 , and hence the product @xmath194 , must be the same for all galaxies of the same luminosity .",
    "lower surface brightness galaxies have rotation curves which rise more gradually than those of higher surface brightness galaxies of the same luminosity ( fact 2 ) . to decrease the rate of rise of the rotation curves as surface brightness decreases , @xmath140 must increase ( equation  21 ) . together , these two require a fine - tuning conspiracy to keep the product @xmath194 constant at fixed luminosity while @xmath140 must vary with the surface brightness .",
    "that is , @xmath193 stays fixed while @xmath140 and @xmath195 oscillate up and down as dictated by .",
    "the -conspiracy has grown into one tying the optical and halo parameters intimately together .",
    "though both dd and sh and their variants do not work , there is a very clear need to keep @xmath156 fixed ( as in sh ) and an equally clear need to vary @xmath140 ( as in dd ) .",
    "the exact amount of variation depends on how the disk - halo decomposition is treated ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "for example , in the maximum disk case , much of the variation in @xmath140 is transferred to , resulting in a systematic increase of  as  decreases , opposite the sense indicated by the colors .",
    "the problem simply shifts from one parameter to another .",
    "in general , introducing more parameters just increases the number of things which must be fine tuned .    to be successful , structure formation models must reproduce this peculiar behavior .",
    "in this section , we examine constraints that our data can place on the various hypothesized forms of dark matter .",
    "ideally , this requires testable predictions for each .",
    "there are some , but not many .",
    "the issue of dark matter has always been data driven . as a result ,",
    "the process is often more a matter of examining the sensibility of previous data - based inferences with the expanded dynamic range of the present data .",
    "perhaps the leading candidate for the dark matter is cdm .",
    "this dm candidate is composed of dynamically cold massive particles . usually imagined to be some hypothetical fundamental particle ( wimps or axions ) , cdm could also be massive black holes or some other entity which only interacts gravitationally .",
    "here we are concerned with only the dynamical effects , since this is all that defines cdm . by stipulation , there is very little else about it that can be tested .",
    "this is both a virtue and a vice , since dm candidates which are relatively easy to detect ( faint stars ) are more easily falsified .    nevertheless , cdm has many genuine virtues . a non - baryonic form of dark matter is required to reconcile dynamical measures of the cosmic density ( @xmath196 ; davis 1996 ) with the low density of baryons indicated by primordial nucleosynthesis ( @xmath197 ; fields 1996 ; copi 1995 ) .",
    "an important aspect of cdm is that it does not respond to radiation pressure .",
    "it can therefore begin to clump and form structure early without leaving too much of an imprint on the microwave background .",
    "indeed , this was another motivation for inventing cdm , since it is not otherwise possible to get from the very smooth universe that existed at the time of recombination to the very clumpy one we see today .",
    "these two facts , @xmath198 and the lack of structural imprint on the microwave background demand cdm .",
    "indeed , the ability of cdm models to hide anisotropies in the microwave background far below the upper limits of various experiments was considered a great success until fluctuations were actually measured by cobe ( bennett 1994 ) .",
    "these are at a level much higher than expected in standard @xmath199 cdm .",
    "the shape of the power spectrum @xmath200 predicted by standard cdm has been clearly falsified ( fisher 1993 ) .",
    "the expectation @xmath201 with @xmath202 is not so much a bona - fide prediction as the physically most plausible case .",
    "so it is possible to repair cdm after the fact .",
    "ideas for doing this include `` tilting '' the spectrum ( twiddling @xmath203 ) , lowering @xmath204 , adding an admixture of hot dark matter to boost @xmath200 on large scales , or invoking the cosmological constant .",
    "indeed , it appears necessary to do several of these things ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 ) .",
    "even so , there are no dark matter candidates more viable than cdm , which does at least make some testable predictions .",
    "for example , the mass function of galaxies is directly calculable , and can be used to predict the observed luminosity function .",
    "it is very difficult to reconcile the two ( heyl 1995 ) .",
    "one expects a much higher ( @xmath205 ) pairwise velocity dispersion than is observed ( @xmath206 ; cen & ostriker 1993 ; governato 1997 ) .",
    "though structure forms rapidly in cdm , cdm scenarios have considerable difficulty in explaining the presence of large disks ( prochaska & wolfe 1997 ) and hot clusters ( donahue 1997 ) at high redshift .",
    "it also anticipates ( kaiser 1986 ) rapid evolution in the cluster x - ray luminosity function which is not observed ( scharf 1997 ; burke 1997 ; rosati 1997 ) .    another important test is whether lsb galaxies are biased relative to hsb galaxies .",
    "this clearly is not as strong an effect as would be required if @xmath199 ( pildis 1997 ) , but does occur in the expected sense ( mo 1994 ) .",
    "this is a definite success , but not one specific to cdm .",
    "the tendency for low density galaxies to reside in low density regions is a generic consequence of bottom - up structure formation .    a very important , testable , bona - fide prediction of cdm has recently been made by navarro ( 1996 ) and cole & lacey ( 1996 ) ; see also dubinski & carlberg ( 1991 ) .",
    "they show that individual cdm halos have a universal structure profile .",
    "these take the form @xmath207 where @xmath208 is the characteristic radius of the halo and @xmath209 is related to the density of the universe at the time of collapse .",
    "these parameters are not independent and are set by the cosmology .",
    "the concentration of the resultant halo is encapsulated in the concentration parameter @xmath210 .",
    "@xmath211 is the radius where the density contrast exceeds 200 , roughly the virial radius .",
    "this establishes a clear expectation value for the mass distribution and resultant rotation curves of cdm halos , which are @xmath212}\\right]^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath213 ( navarro 1996 ) .",
    "the velocity @xmath214 is characteristic of the halo , and is defined in the same way as @xmath211 .",
    "the halo rotation curve is thus specified by two parameters , @xmath214 and @xmath215 , which give the total halo mass and the degree of concentration of that mass .",
    "low surface brightness galaxies are a good place to test this prediction as their disks are dynamically insignificant : the rotation curves provide a direct map of the dark mass distribution .",
    "the strongest test is afforded by the lowest surface brightness galaxy with the best resolved rotation curve .",
    "surface brightness is important because it is related to the rate of rise of the rotation curve which constrains the concentration parameter .",
    "resolution is important because we wish to test the shape of the rotation curve specified by equation  ( 25 ) .",
    "the galaxy which best suits these requirements is f5831 .    in order to compare observations with theory",
    ", we need to do several things .",
    "observationally , we wish to remove the influence of the known baryonic component and isolate the dark matter .",
    "this is done by assuming the maximum disk mass of de blok & mcgaugh ( 1997 ) .",
    "both full and corrected rotation curves are shown in fig .  14 , where it can be seen that the assumption about the optical disk mass is irrelevant .",
    "this is the virtue of using lsb galaxies for this sort of test .    theoretically , we need to specify an appropriate @xmath215 and @xmath214 .",
    "the concentration parameter depends on the cosmology , for which we consider several possibilities using the halo characterization code provided by navarro ( 1997 , private communication ) .",
    "we will refer to three basic cases : standard cdm with @xmath199 ( scdm ) , open cdm with @xmath216 ( ocdm ) , and a flat @xmath217-dominated cosmology with @xmath218 ( @xmath217cdm ) .",
    "lower @xmath219 generally results in lower @xmath215 , as does lower @xmath37 .",
    "the latter is not a strong effect , so we retain a fixed @xmath220 .",
    "other parameters matter fairly little , except the normalization of the power spectrum which we fix to the cobe observations . adopting another normalization , like that for rich clusters ,",
    "has the fairly minor effect of interchanging the relative concentrations of the ocdm and @xmath217cdm cases : ocdm is the least concentrated model with a cobe normalization , but @xmath217cdm is the least concentrated for a lower normalization .",
    "this distinction is unimportant .",
    "we shall see that the observations require extremely low @xmath221 .",
    "such low concentrations are readily obtained only by lowering the power spectrum normalization to @xmath222 .",
    "this is completely inconsistent with either the cobe or the rich cluster normalization .",
    "the last item we need is an estimate @xmath214 or the mass of the halo , which is also a minor factor in determining @xmath215 .",
    "this can be done in a variety of ways .",
    "perhaps the most obvious is to use the observed baryonic disk mass as an indicator of the halo mass .",
    "the mass of the disk is reasonably well constrained by the maximum disk solution ( @xmath223 ) and the fact that most of the baryons are in directly observable atomic gas ( @xmath224 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that any significant additional baryonic mass is in undetected forms ( either molecular or ionized gas ) , and even factors of two here will not much affect the arguments which follow .",
    "the total baryonic mass of f5831 is thus @xmath225 .",
    "this can be combined with a baryon fraction to give a halo mass .",
    "the universal baryon fraction is thought to be well measured by rich clusters of galaxies , giving @xmath226 ( for @xmath227 ; white & fabian 1995 ) .",
    "this then implies a halo mass of @xmath228 .",
    "note that the maximum disk decomposition already implies @xmath229 ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) , so either this disk is observed to very near the edge of its halo , or the baryon fraction determined in clusters is not universal (  8) .",
    "the concentration indices derived for these cases are listed in table  4 and the results plotted in fig .",
    "the results are disastrous .",
    "the scdm model grossly overpredicts the rate of rise of the rotation curve .",
    "the less concentrated ocdm and @xmath217cdm models do the same .",
    "worse , all predict very much the wrong asymptotic velocity , as the halo mass appropriate for the observed baryon mass gives @xmath230 when @xmath231 .",
    "part of the problem here is the well known failure of cdm models to simultaneously match the observed luminosity density and the normalization of the tully - fisher relation ( heyl 1995 ; frenk 1996 ) .",
    "let us therefore try another approach .",
    "navarro ( 1996a ) suggests that the tully - fisher relation arises because @xmath232 ( though note that navarro 1996b found that halo mass should not be well correlated with optical luminosity ) . by adopting @xmath233 , we should at least come close to matching the outer portion of the rotation curve .",
    "this implies a much more massive halo , @xmath234 , and a correspondingly lower baryon fraction , @xmath235 .",
    "this exercise again fails ( fig  14b ) .",
    "only the lowest @xmath215 model comes close to the observations , and even that predicts velocities which are too high for the dark matter .",
    "this is especially true in the inner parts , but remains true even in the outer parts where the normalization was set .",
    "apparently , the tully - fisher relation does not arise form a simple equation of @xmath13 with @xmath214 .",
    "but if it does not , why does a tully - fisher relation with small scatter arise at all ?",
    "note that the shapes of the observed rotation curves are not similar to the predicted shapes .",
    "is it possible to fit the data with equation  ( 25 ) at all ?",
    "the answer would appear to be no .",
    "14(c ) gives several examples which come reasonably close by choosing @xmath215 and @xmath214 without regard to their cosmological origins .",
    "the model with @xmath236 gives a nicely flat rotation curve for the outer points , but grossly over predicts the inner rotation .",
    "lower concentration models can be made to fit the interior points , but then get the exterior ones wrong .",
    "equation  ( 30 ) gives the wrong shape , and the clear prediction of cdm is simply not realized : @xmath237 moreover , we do not have the freedom to fit @xmath215 and @xmath214 freely .",
    "the virtue of the model is that these are predicted once the cosmological parameters ( especially @xmath219 , @xmath200 , and @xmath97 ) are stipulated .",
    "no plausible cosmology predicts @xmath238 which approximate the lowest surface brightness galaxies .    it has already been noted ( moore 1994 ; flores & primack 1994 ) that the steep interior density distribution ( @xmath239 at small @xmath17 ) predicted by cdm is completely inconsistent with the few ( 4 ) analyzed observations of dwarf galaxies .",
    "these are all low surface brightness systems , which is the reason they are relevant .",
    "this problem of the shape of the rotation curves is general and clear in all of our data .",
    "we therefore confirm and extend the results of moore ( 1994 ) and flores & primack ( 1994 ) .",
    "this situation admits three possibilities :    1 .",
    "cdm is not the solution to the mass discrepancy problem ; 2 .",
    "cdm is correct but @xmath240 has not been correctly predicted ; or 3 .",
    "both are correct but further physics intervenes to transform @xmath240 into @xmath241 .",
    "the second possibility seems unlikely .",
    "there is widespread agreement between independent modeling efforts ( dubinski 1994 ; navarro 1996 ; cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "there is good physical reason for this agreement .",
    "non - baryonic cdm only interacts gravitationally , with no way to set a preferred scale such as a core radius .",
    "this prediction of cdm seems very robust .    within the framework of cdm",
    ", we are thus forced to consider the third possibility .",
    "this requires large scale mass redistribution which presumably results from the behavior of the baryonic component .",
    "the behavior of the baryons depends on such things as the hydrodynamics of gas flows and energy input from star formation , and is much more difficult to model than the cdm .",
    "various possibilities for the effect of the baryons are generally referred to as `` feedback '' or sometimes as `` gastrophysics . ''",
    "that feedback takes place at some level will modify the prediction that arises from cdm - only models . however , there is no guarantee that it will fix the problem under consideration .",
    "if we simply add feedback parameters to the model and tune them to match the observations , the model loses its predictive value .",
    "there are three basic possibilities for mass redistribution :    1 .",
    "contraction of the cdm following dissipation of the baryons ; 2 .",
    "orbital family redistribution at small radii ; and 3 .",
    "expansion of the cdm following expulsion of baryons in galactic winds .",
    "these might come about in a myriad of ways ; we discuss the generic aspects of each in turn below .",
    "there is , however , a serious objection to any of them being important to large scale redistribution of the dark matter . in dark matter dominated lsb galaxies , baryons are a very small fraction of the total mass .",
    "to alter @xmath7 in the required fashion is a case of the tail wagging the dog .",
    "the first possibility is that the dissipation of baryons during disk formation draws the dark matter distribution further in .",
    "this is sometimes called the adiabatic response of the halo to the disk , and should happen at some level ( dubinski 1994 ) .",
    "it is relatively straightforward to model , but makes the problem _",
    "worse_. halos which are initially too concentrated become even more so .    in order to model adiabatic contraction",
    ", one generally assumes that the baryons conserve angular momentum .",
    "this need not be the case , as numerical models indicate that a great deal of angular momentum can be transported to the dark matter ( katz & gunn 1991 )",
    ". such a process might result in the redistribution of orbital families , especially at small radii where the importance of the baryons is maximized .",
    "such a redistribution might alter the cuspy nature of the initial cdm mass distribution .",
    "this process must transfer enough angular momentum to the dark matter to establish a large core radius , but not so much that it fails to form a rotationally supported baryonic disk .",
    "simulations suggest that while some orbital redistribution does occur , it does not significantly impact @xmath7 ( merritt 1997 ) .",
    "the third possibility is the opposite of the first .",
    "massive amounts of baryons are expelled .",
    "the dark matter follows gravitationally , thus establishing a more diffuse mass distribution . a frequently invoked mechanism for expelling the baryons is feedback due to violent star formation ( navarro 1996c ) .",
    "there is one clear prediction of this scenario : galaxies explode and gas is lost . yet",
    "the dim galaxies for which the need for mass redistribution is most severe are in fact very gas rich ( mcgaugh & de blok 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , a direct search for the residue of baryonic blow out resulted in non - detection ( bothun 1992 ) .",
    "it therefore seems unlikely that baryonic outflows can play a significant role in redistributing the dark matter .",
    "regardless of what mechanism is invoked , two drastic events are required to reconcile cdm with the observations .",
    "first , the baryon fraction must change by an order of magnitude from the universal value found in clusters .",
    "second , the dark matter distribution must be radically changed from a navarro ( 1996 ) profile ( equation  24 ) to something close to an isothermal sphere ( equation  20 ) .",
    "this is indeed a major transformation : @xmath242 at small @xmath17 and @xmath243 at large @xmath17 .    in many ways , cdm is superior to other hypothesized forms of dark matter .",
    "most importantly , it does make some testable predictions . unfortunately , these predictions persistently fail .",
    "another possible dark matter candidate is a massive neutrino . though often invoked in the context of the solar neutrino problem , a massive neutrino does not help with the mass discrepancy problem in lsb galaxies .",
    "it has long been known that hot dark matter is good at forming structure on large scales ( top - down ) , but not at making galaxies . in order for neutrinos to remain in dwarf galaxy halos",
    ", they would have to be much more massive than allowed by experiment ( lin & faber 1983 ) .",
    "it seems unlikely that mixing hot and cold dark matter would address the problems encountered by cdm alone , simply because the hdm component plays no role on the small scale of galaxies .",
    "baryonic dark matter is any form of hypothesized dm composed of ordinary matter .",
    "there are a great variety of hypothesized forms including brown dwarfs , very faint stars , jupiters , and very cold molecular gas .",
    "the advantage of bdm is that baryons are known to exist .",
    "the problem is that bdm candidates are detectable , so most have been ruled out ( carr 1994 ) .",
    "the case in favor of bdm has been strengthened by the recent detection of microlensing events ( alcock 1996 ) .",
    "however , the detection of microlensing , a physical process which should at least occasionally occur , is not the same as the detection of bdm machos .",
    "the clearest result of these experiments is to rule out machos as dark matter over many decades of mass , up to and including the most reasonable possibility of brown dwarfs ( ansari 1996 ; renault 1997 ) . only if the lensing objects are surprisingly massive ( @xmath244 )",
    "can machos make up a significant fraction of the halo , and only then because this mass delimits the sensitivity range of the experiments .",
    "sufficient statistics have yet to accrue to demand a significant halo mass fraction ( paczynski 1996 ) , and there is no guarantee that the events observed to date are connected with the missing mass problem .",
    "since particle physics analogies are often made for these experiments , we offer one of our own .",
    "the first thing one is likely to learn about is the background contaminants one did not expect ( zaritsky & lin 1997 ) .",
    "a substantial amount of bdm suffers the two serious drawbacks which motivate cdm : the small amplitude of fluctuations in the microwave background and @xmath198 from primordial nucleosynthesis .",
    "although @xmath245 is often invoked as an argument for baryonic dark matter , this can not explain the dynamical mass discrepancy or add up to the total @xmath219 ( dalcanton 1994 ) . to contemplate a conventional universe composed entirely of baryons",
    ", one must somehow dismiss both of these pillars of modern cosmology .    we are not aware of viable bdm scenarios which make specific predictions .",
    "those which did have been ruled out .",
    "nevertheless , there are several lines of argument favoring bdm .",
    "one is that light and dark matter are intimately coupled .",
    "this is certainly true ( paper ii ) .",
    "the potential for information transfer between the distinct dynamical components is maximized if they are cut from the same cloth .",
    "another connections is that the ratio of atomic gas mass to dynamical mass @xmath246 seems to be roughly constant ( bosma 1981 ) .",
    "this holds approximately true for lsb galaxies ( see fig .",
    "13 of de blok 1996 ) as @xmath247 and  are both related to  with similar slopes .",
    "a serious problem with this picture is the total failure of @xmath96 to redress the -  relation ( fig .",
    "this occurs because a constant @xmath246 gives a constant shift in @xmath248 , not a systematic trend as required .",
    "the only way to salvage this picture would be to arbitrarily make the conversion factor @xmath249 between @xmath250 and total gas mass an appropriate function of .",
    "that is , since @xmath107 strictly applies only to atomic gas , one might suppose that molecular gas becomes systematically more important with decreasing surface brightness .",
    "this would have to be an enormous effect to account for the large change in , and of course must be very systematic with surface brightness .",
    "this seems quite unreasonable , and in fact the opposite is observed : lower surface brightness galaxies appear to have substantially less molecular gas than higher surface brightness spirals ( schombert 1990 ) .",
    "an additional conspiracy must now be invoked : the @xmath43 conversion factor also varies systematically with surface brightness .",
    "this would have to be a big effect , but the size if not the systematic surface brightness dependence is already required if much of the dark matter is to be hidden in molecular form ( pfenniger 1994 ) .",
    "another motivation for bdm is that the outer shape of the rotation curve of hsb galaxies can sometimes be fit by scaling up the contribution of the hi .",
    "this suggests an additional undetected gaseous component with the same distribution as the hi but substantially more mass .",
    "implicit in this is that the dark matter be confined to a disk , which has the usual problems with disk instability ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ) .",
    "if instead the bdm is distributed in a halo , there is no reason to draw a connection between the shape of the hi disk and that of the total rotation curve .",
    "we can test the notion of gas - scaling against the rotation curves of lsb galaxies .",
    "this sometimes works tolerably well , as long as one is free to adjust the scaling factor from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "however , it frequently fails to reproduce the shape of the rotation curves at all well . in fig .",
    "15 , we show the _ best _ fit that can be obtained by this method to the best resolved lsb galaxy .",
    "the shape of the actual rotation curve is completely different from that predicted by the hi distribution .",
    "this is often true of the lsb data , so even though there may be some cases of hsb galaxies where the rotation curves are reasonably well predicted by the hi distribution , this simply is not the case in lsb galaxies .",
    "this removes a major argument in favor of bdm .",
    "the various arguments in favor of bdm make no sense in the context of the lsb galaxy observations .",
    "this does not completely rule out the existence of bdm , or mean that we have discovered and cataloged every baryon in the universe .",
    "but it does make it very difficult to construct a sensible model with a dynamically important component of bdm .",
    "in general , the arguments which favor bdm are based on the inferred coupling between dark and luminous matter . with this",
    "much we certainly concur : the two components must be intimately related (  6.2 ) . indeed ,",
    "there does exist a unique analytic formalism relating the dynamics to the observed luminous mass distribution ( papers ii and iii ) .",
    "there are a few interesting constraints that can be placed on the presence of dark matter completely irrespective of its composition .",
    "there is a wealth of data besides rotation curves which bear on the issue .",
    "these place both upper and lower limits on the extent and mass of dark matter halos , and sometimes provide measures of the actual baryon fraction .",
    "observations which place lower limits include the maximum radii to which rotation curves remain flat ( sancisi & van albada 1987 ; meurer 1996 ) , the timing argument in the local group ( kahn & woltjer 1959 ; peebles 1989 ) , the statistical motions of satellite galaxies at large separations from @xmath251 galaxies ( zaritsky & white 1994 ) , and qso absorption lines which imply large halos with roughly flat rotation curves extending to very large radii ( barcons 1995 ) .",
    "evidence which places upper limits on the extent of dark halos is more difficult to establish , but there is the very important result that overly massive halos suppress the formation of observed tidal tails ( dubinski 1996 ) .",
    "in addition , it might be possible to constrain the amount of dark matter allowed within the optical radius by disk stability constraints . some dark matter is needed to stabilize disks ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ) , but too much inhibits features like spiral arms which stem from self gravity in the disk . this criterion has been used by athanassoula ( 1987 ) to place minimum masses on disks in disk - halo decompositions",
    "finally , it now seems reasonably well established that actual baryon fractions can be measured in x - ray galaxy clusters so that the ratio of dark to luminous mass is known ( white 1993 ; white & fabian 1995 ; evrard 1996 ) .",
    "the most interesting ( extreme ) of these limits are shown in fig .",
    "16 and given in table  5 .",
    "listed are the object , the type of data and analysis , the linear extent required of the dark matter halo ( in both kpc and disk scale lengths where applicable ) , the observed mass to light ratio , the ratio of dark to luminous mass , the corresponding baryon fraction , and the source of the data .",
    "we have been as conservative as possible in assessing these limits ; most of them are quite hard .",
    "listed first are those observations which place lower limits on the amount of dark matter required .",
    "the hardest of these limits come from the extended  rotation curves of disk galaxies .",
    "these are observed to remain flat as far as observed , sometimes to very large radii . to calculate the limits ,",
    "we have used the maximum disk case , attributing as much mass as possible to the luminous matter .",
    "the minimum required dark mass is then just @xmath252 .",
    "ngc 3198 is a classic example of an hsb spiral with a rotation curve which remains flat to 11 scale lengths , nearly 3 times the extent of the bulk of the luminous mass .",
    "the dark halo must extend at least this far , and presumably much further since there is no hint of a turn down in @xmath6 .",
    "however , the required amount of dark mass is fairly modest : @xmath253 exceeds the observed luminous mass @xmath254 by only a factor of a few .",
    "recently , meurer ( 1996 ) have been able to trace @xmath6 out to 22 scale lengths in the hsb dwarf ngc 2915 .",
    "this extraordinary radius places interesting constraints , with the dark mass exceeding the luminous baryonic mass by at least a factor of 19 .",
    "there are 4 lsb galaxies listed in table  5 ; we have chosen the most extreme examples with @xmath255 .",
    "there are many more which are nearly as extreme ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) .",
    "even though @xmath6 is not measured to large @xmath256 in lsb galaxies as in the above 2 examples , it should be obvious from fig .",
    "4 that lsb galaxies provide interesting limits in this way .",
    "the lowest surface brightness galaxies have @xmath257 , so @xmath255 for @xmath258 .",
    "this is a fairly conservative number in the @xmath9-band ; @xmath259 is more realistic .",
    "we do not need to make any assumption about  though : the dynamical mass of the baryonic disk is constrained by the rotation curve .",
    "we stress that the limits obtained from the maximum disk decompositions of the rotation curves provide very hard lower limits on @xmath260 and @xmath39 .",
    "maximum disk does not generally return realistic values for , especially in lsb galaxies ( de blok & mcgaugh 1997 ) . a more reasonable estimator based on disk velocity dispersions ( bottema 1993 , 1997 ) gives nearly a factor of 2 less in hsb galaxies and even less in lsb galaxies .",
    "also , we have of course not observed to the edge of the halo .",
    "it is difficult to construct a model in which the effects of an outer edge to the halo does not lead to observable consequences unless @xmath261 .",
    "the point is that the limits in table  5 are both hard and conservative .",
    "a more realistic estimate gives a result 3 or 4 times more extreme .",
    "aside from  rotation curves , there are a number of other observations which place lower limits on the extent of dark matter halos . barcons ( 1995 )",
    "present observations of two systems with qso absorption lines in ionized gas many tens of kpc from the centers of disk galaxies , very nearly along the major axis .",
    "the gas is apparently associated with the galaxies , though the geometry and orbital orientation are unknown . nevertheless , nearly flat rotation seems to persist out to very large radii .",
    "if interpreted in the most obvious way , this implies limits even more extreme than those derived from bona - fide rotation curves .    on larger scales ,",
    "the timing argument in the local group ( peebles 1989 ) implies yet more dark matter .",
    "the same sort of result follows from the motions of satellite galaxies around @xmath251 galaxies , which show no evidence of an edge to the halos to the largest scales probed , @xmath262 kpc ( zaritsky & white 1994 ; zaritsky 1997 ) .",
    "though statistical in nature , both of these approaches robustly require @xmath263 . for @xmath258 ,",
    "this means @xmath264 .",
    "this is generally consistent with the impression given by the rotation curves : dark matter halos are large and massive .",
    "the lower limits just discussed are challenging to obtain .",
    "perhaps even more difficult to acquire are upper limits on the extent of dark matter halos .",
    "nevertheless , a few constraints can be placed .",
    "recently , dubinski ( 1996 ) have pointed out that massive halos suppress the formation of tidal tails observed around merger remnants .",
    "this constrains the dark to luminous mass ration rather severely ; tidal features do not form unless @xmath265 .",
    "this upper limit is smaller than the hard lower limits imposed above , @xmath266 .",
    "the results of dubinski ( 1996 ) are based on @xmath267-body simulations which one might simply choose to dismiss as model dependent .",
    "however , further modeling ( mihos 1997 ) shows that there is no plausible variation of parameters which changes the essential result .",
    "there is a very good , simple reason for this .",
    "if dark matter halos are large and massive , the baryonic matter is buried at the bottom of a deep potential well . even in a violent merger",
    ", the largest velocities imparted to some of the stars are insufficient to climb out of this potential well .",
    "this very effectively suffocates the formation of the large , linear features observed in merger remnants to extend over tens and sometimes even hundreds of kpc .",
    "systems with @xmath268 suppress such features before they get started .",
    "strictly speaking , it is the gradient of the potential which this modeling exercise constrains , not just the dark to luminous mass ratio ( mihos 1997 ) .",
    "it is possible to contrive very tenuous halo distributions which might weaken this limit , essentially by placing lots of mass at large radii where it does not participate in the merger dynamics .",
    "the tidal tails argument therefore provides the weakest of the limits discussed so far , and the only upper limit , so one might be tempted to equivocate .",
    "however , it does not appear that the argument can simply be dismissed .",
    "the limit it imposes is separated from the others by a factor of 2 and points in the _ opposite _ direction .",
    "models contrived specifically to evade the tidal tails limit seem unlikely to satisfy other constraints .",
    "another way to constrain the ratio of halo to disk mass , at least within the radius of the disk , comes from disk stability .",
    "purely newtonian disks suffer from unchecked instabilities ; perturbations like bars grow exponentially and destroy the disk in a few dynamical times .",
    "the survival of spiral disks over a hubble time requires some stabilizing influence .",
    "one possibility is to embed the disks in dynamically hot , spherical dark matter halos ( ostriker & peebles 1973 ) , though it should be noted that altering the effective force law can also have a stabilizing effect ( christodoulou 1991 ) .",
    "the problem with dark matter halos is that they can provide too much stability .",
    "observed features like bars and spiral arms occur because of self - gravity in the disk .",
    "if the halo is too dominant , this is negligible and one must invoke non - dynamical origins for the observed features .",
    "athanassoula ( 1987 ) used this fact to constrain  in their rotation curve decompositions . in hsb galaxies , this gives reasonable results , the relevant effects being relatively small ( @xmath269 difference between the maximum disk and the minimum disk required to sustain spiral structure ) .",
    "translating this into a limit on the dark halo mass within the radius of the optical disk gives @xmath270 or 4 .",
    "lsb galaxies are so dark matter dominated , even within the optical extent of the disk , that features due to disk self gravity should simply not be evident ( mihos 1997 ) .",
    "the minimum disk required to form spiral features by the criteria of athanassoula ( 1987 ) exceeds the maximum disk allowed by the rotation curve ( quillen & pickering 1997 ) .",
    "though rarely pretty grand design spirals , lsb galaxies do have spiral features ( de blok 1995 ; mcgaugh 1995 ) .",
    "this is not an isolated problem of a few strange morphologies ; @xmath271 of the 198 lsb galaxies in the primary list of schombert ( 1992 ) are spirals .",
    "again , one might be inclined to equivocate .",
    "spiral structure is not well understood , and might not have an origin internal to disk dynamics at all .",
    "it is not likely that the spiral features can be attributed to interactions with companions , as lsb galaxies are usually very isolated ( bothun 1993 ; mo 1994 ) .",
    "the more extreme lsb galaxies have @xmath272 , whereas dynamical spiral features seem to require @xmath273 .",
    "considerable work remains to be done to better quantify these effects , but the discrepancy is already large .",
    "there is a serious problem with invoking dark matter halos to stabilize disks if spiral structure is driven by disk self - gravity as often supposed .",
    "so far we have only discussed limits which can be placed on the amount of dark matter required by various observations .",
    "recently , it has become possible to estimate actual baryon fractions in x - ray clusters and groups of galaxies ( white 1993 ; white & fabian 1995 ; pildis 1995 ) .",
    "this procedure has a number of uncertainties , but the essential result seems to be quite robust ( evrard 1996 ) .",
    "this gives a surprisingly large amount of baryonic mass , @xmath226 for the value of the hubble constant adopted here .",
    "this resides between the limits discussed above .",
    "the clusters give @xmath274 , while rotation curves , satellites and the local group all require @xmath266 and tidal tails imply @xmath265 .    at this juncture ,",
    "it is unclear how to proceed .",
    "one option is to selectively disbelieve some combination of the results imposing these contradictory limits .",
    "note that it is not possible to arrive at a single universal baryon fraction by dismissing a single limit ; at least several observations must be altered .",
    "another option is to conclude that @xmath97 varies arbitrarily from halo to halo .",
    "we could perhaps salvage a universal @xmath97 by making some or all of the dark matter baryonic , and simply varying the fraction which becomes luminous .",
    "the distinction between these two latter possibilities is small . in both cases , we must randomly vary the amount of luminous matter in a way stipulated only by observation .",
    "things that form tidal tails happen to have small halos .",
    "galaxies with satellites happen to have large halos .",
    "the tully - fisher relation somehow manages to ignore these random , large fluctuations in the luminous to dark mass ratio and remain universal with little scatter .",
    "structure formation theories lose all potential predictive power since @xmath97 becomes a free parameter for each and every halo .",
    "it is not clear whether the contradictory limits imposed by the various observations can be reconciled .",
    "further work needs to concentrate on this point and on the fine - tuning problems that arise from the systematics of rotation curves .",
    "the current situation also poses a philosophical dilemma : what would be required to falsify the dark matter hypothesis ?",
    "we thank all the many , many people who have discussed and debated these issues with us with varying degrees of patience and credulity .",
    "we are particularly grateful to renzo sancisi and vera rubin for many enlightening conversations .",
    "most of all , we would like to thank thijs van der hulst for his contributions to our work .",
    "we also thank peter van dokkum for the lively debate which clarified the virtues and vices of dd and sh , and brought out the implicit assumptions we all were making .",
    "we are also grateful to chris mihos , roelof bottema , eric schulman , moti milgrom , and the referee for their comments .",
    "we would both like to thank the kapteyn institute and the department of terrestrial magnetism of the carnegie institution of washington for their strong support and warm hospitality .",
    "in the discussion of the physical interpretation of the tully fisher relation (  5 ) , we adopted the near infrared luminosity as an indicator of stellar mass .",
    "this results in a slope sometimes attributed to the viral theorem , @xmath275 this particular slope is not specific to dark matter in general , as it depends on the assumptions which are necessarily made (  5 ) .",
    "here we show that band pass dependent deviations of the slope from the adopted value have no significant impact on our discussion of the physical interpretation of the tully fisher relation . the full requirement on the relation between mass to light ratio , surface brightness , and luminosity imposed by the tully - fisher relation in any band pass @xmath69 is @xmath276 where @xmath277 measures the band",
    "pass dependent deviation of the slope of the tully - fisher relation from the adopted value of 4 .",
    "this is a small effect compared to the fine balancing act which must be performed by @xmath29 and @xmath26 .",
    "consider the residual color term between two bands @xmath69 and @xmath278 .",
    "the residual effect on the mass to light ratio is @xmath279\\ ] ] where @xmath280 is the color .",
    "for example , if @xmath281 and @xmath282 , this becomes @xmath283\\ ] ] so a 1 mag .",
    "color change corresponds to a 0.27 dex shift in the ratio of @xmath29 , and 1 mag .  in luminosity to a shift of only 0.07 dex .",
    "systematic changes in the slope of the tully - fisher relation with band pass can plausibly be attributed to modest systematic variation of the stellar population or extinction with luminosity .",
    "the observed trends operate in the sense expected for stellar populations ( brighter galaxies tend to be redder ) and the luminosity - metallicity relation ( brighter galaxies should contain relatively more dust ) .",
    "these are small effects which have no real impact on the @xmath29-@xmath26 relation .",
    "the increment for increment shift expected in the tully - fisher relation with surface brightness does not happen .",
    "this requires fine - tuning over nearly 5 magnitudes in  irrespective of the precise slope of the tully - fisher relation .",
