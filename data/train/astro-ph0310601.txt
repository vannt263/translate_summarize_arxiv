    "a - b ) open a new epoch for the cmb investigation .",
    "these data serve for the development of more refined technique for future high resolution measurements and for a choice of the realistic cosmological model .",
    "the _ wmap _ has observed the full sky in five frequency bands : k   ( centered frequency 22.8 ghz ) , ka  ( 33.0 ghz),q  ( 40.7 ghz ) , v  ( 60.8 ghz ) , and w  ( 93.5 ghz ) and produced five maps represented in @xmath1 healpix ( grski et al . 1999 )",
    "pixels . then , using smoothing of the maps to @xmath2 and performing cleaning of the combined multifrequency map by minimization of the rms variance for each pixel , the _ wmap _ team produced the internal linear combination ( ilc ) map taking 12 optimization coefficients @xmath3 for 12 disjoint sky regions .",
    "thus , the ilc map has a minimal variance corresponding to the minimization of the galaxy and foreground contamination at the range of multipoles @xmath4 .",
    "tegmark , de oliveira - costa and hamilton ( 2003 ) ( hereafter toh ) have suggested to use ideologically similar but technically different optimization scheme based on tegmark and efstathiou ( 1996 ) ( hereafter te ) method .",
    "the main goal of the toh method is to combine the k ",
    "w band maps into the foreground cleaned map ( fcm ) using variable weighting coefficients @xmath5 for each frequency band @xmath6=k  w . in order to minimize the total unweighted power from the galaxy , foregrounds and noise separately for each harmonic @xmath7 , toh subdivided the sky into 9 disjoint regions and performed cleaning of the 5 frequency maps in each region .",
    "unlike the ilc map , the toh fcm has smaller power at the multipole range @xmath8 .",
    "both the ilc and toh fcm are available from the web and can be used for analysis of the foregrounds and the statistical properties of the cleaned maps .",
    "for example , komatsu et al . ( 2003 ) tested the non  gaussianity of the _ wmap _ cmb signal using minkowski functionals as a statistic .",
    "chiang et al . ( 2003 ) have also tested the statistics of the phases for the ilc and the toh fcm maps and discussed non - gaussianity of the toh fcm map .",
    "dineen and coles ( 2003 ) have presented a diagnostic of the galactic synchrotron contamination and have discovered the cross ",
    "correlation between faraday rotation measure and the toh fcm map ( see also coles et al . 2003 ) .",
    "recently naselsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) proposed the phase cleaning method ( pcm ) for decomposition of the cmb signal and foregrounds using the _ wmap _ data .",
    "the main idea of the pcm is to minimize the variance of the combined k ",
    "w maps and cross  correlations of the cmb and foreground phases simultaneously .",
    "the result of pcm in its application to the _ wmap _ data reproduces well the power spectrum of the best - fit _ wmap _ @xmath9cdm model at the range @xmath10 .",
    "the main target of our paper is to extend the resolution of the derived pcm cmb map up to @xmath11 , to perform the the cross - correlation analysis ( circular and linear statistics and `` friend  of  friend '' analysis ) of the cmb and foreground phases and to estimate their interconnection .",
    "we have included the ilc , toh fcm and the pcm maps in our analysis and have discovered significant deviation of the phase statistics from the expected for uniformly random phases .",
    "we have shown that such a kind of non - gaussianity arises owing to the contamination of the foregrounds signal in the ilc , toh fcm and the pcm maps .",
    "the fluctuations of measured cmb plus foregrounds radiation on a sky sphere can be expressed as a sum over spherical harmonics : @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the coefficients of expansion , @xmath14=2.73k , and @xmath15=0 .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic cmb gaussian random fields ( grfs ) , as a result of the simplest inflation paradigm , possess @xmath16 modes whose real and imaginary parts are independently distributed .",
    "the statistical properties of this field are completely specified by its angular power spectrum @xmath17 , @xmath18 and random phases @xmath19 which are uniformly distributed at the range @xmath20 . for the foregrounds ,",
    "the signal is obviously non - gaussian .",
    "so , for the combined cmb + foregrounds signal we define @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the modulus and @xmath23 is the phase of each @xmath24 harmonic . in practice ,",
    "each of the _ wmap _ k  w maps is decomposed into set of @xmath25 where @xmath26 and index @xmath27 corresponds to k , ka , ... , w bands , using the healpix code ( grski et al .",
    "harmonics estimation . ]    the basic idea of the pcm is to generalize the toh and te minimization scheme including also the minimization of the cross - correlations between derived cmb signal and foregrounds ( naselsky et al .",
    "the method does not require any galactic cut  offs or disjoint regions .",
    "following naselsky et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , we consider the combinations of the _ wmap _ maps : ka  q , ka  v and q  v , for which the higher correlations between foreground phases takes place .. for each pairs of the maps , we introduce weighting coefficients @xmath28 similar to toh and te methods and minimize the variance of the derived map per each mode @xmath7 .",
    "neglecting the instrumental for @xmath4 noise and taking into account the beam shape deconvolution , we consider the signal as a superposition of the cmb and the foregrounds .    from all @xmath29 , we have found the phases @xmath30 ( see eq  ( [ eq2])([eq4 ] ) ) .",
    "each set of the @xmath29 coefficients is defined by a combination of the different foreground coefficients @xmath31 and the cmb signal @xmath32 , where index @xmath33 marks the synchrotron , free - free and dust emission . for each combination of the maps ,",
    "the derived cmb map is defined as @xmath34 where @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the phase of @xmath37-channel .",
    "the phases of the reconstructed cmb are related to the foregrounds amplitudes and phases as follows ( naselsky et al .",

    "( 2003 ) , the phases of the reconstructed cmb signal @xmath41 would have correlations with those of foregrounds .",

    "2003 ) .",
    "practical implementation of the pcm includes the iteration scheme in which the first step corresponds to minimization of the variance of the derived map in each mode @xmath7 with the choice of coefficients eq.([eq6 ] ) .",
    "this step of optimization reconstructs the pre - cmb and pre - foreground map for each pair of channels where the foreground maps are a simple subtraction @xmath16 coefficients of the k  w signals and derived pre - cmb @xmath16 .",
    "then , using the moduli and phases of the pre - foregrounds we perform the next iteration , using eqs.([eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq5 ] ) and so on .",
    "this iteration scheme is stable and reproduce quite well the cmb signal from each pair of k ",
    "w maps after two steps of iteration .",
    "= 7.cm    however , the cmb maps reconstructed from each pair of k  w maps are slightly different because of residues of the foregrounds .",
    "to minimize such residues , as the last step of the pcm we use the so called min - max filter for each pixels of the map .",
    "the min - max filter compares signals , @xmath47 , in each pixel @xmath48 in a set of maps . in this method , we chose the minimal amplitude of @xmath47 in the pixel as the cmb signal , i.e. @xmath49 , where @xmath50 . to estimate residues from point sources , we find the maximal amplitude of the signal in each pixel @xmath51 , where @xmath52 , for all the pre - cmb maps produced by the method eq.([eq9 ] ) . for true cmb ,",
    "the difference @xmath53 is equal to zero and we consider @xmath53 as a measure of deviation from the cmb map .",
    "the reason for such a filter is quite obvious .",
    "the signal in each pixel is a superposition of the cmb signal and ( small ) residues of the foregrounds .",
    "if correlations between the cmb signal and foregrounds are minimal then we expect that all the deviations of the @xmath54 in the pixel are caused by the residues . in our case ,",
    "two approximations of the cmb map restored by ka  v and q  v channels ( naselsky et al . 2003 ) have been used and @xmath55 has been taken as the cmb map .    the result of the pcm application to the _ wmap _ data at the range @xmath0 is shown in fig.1 for the cmb signal . in this figure ,",
    "the differences between the ilc and pcm maps ( top right ) , toh fcm and pcm ( bottom left ) and between toh wiener and pcm maps ( bottom right ) are also shown .",
    "as is shown in fig.1 , the main difference is connected with sources in the galactic plane and the harmonic @xmath56 which is probably related to the galactic emission . the difference shows foreground components being absent in the pcm map .    for the simplest estimator of the power spectrum , @xmath57 , we show in fig.2 the power spectrum for the ilc , fcm , pcm and toh wiener filtered maps .",
    "as one can see from fig.2 the pcm map reproduces well the spectrum for the toh wiener filtered map .",
    "three cleaned maps ( ilc , fcm and pcm ) are produced from different methods of the foreground component separation .",
    "for the perfect separation of the cmb signal and foregrounds we can expect small random correlations between their phases .",
    "however , these methods provide the approximate separation only . therefore , these remaining cross ",
    "correlations between phases of the cleaned signal , @xmath58 , and the foregrounds , @xmath59 , can be used to characterize the degree of separation achieved .    to do this",

    "we will use also the linear correlation coefficients and more refined `` friend  of  friend '' statistics discussed , for example , by roeder ( 1992 ) neglecting circularity of the phases .",
    "indeed , equivalence of the phases @xmath60 and @xmath61 , changes their correlation functions and cumulants and the results obtained with the `` friend  of  friend '' statistics . to suppress this effect we compared our result with 200 random realizations of poissonian process prepared in the same manner ( see sec.3.3 ) .",
