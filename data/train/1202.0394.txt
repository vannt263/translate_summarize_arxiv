    "the issue to extend general relativity ( gr ) has recently become dramatically urgent due to the missing matter problem at all astrophysical scales and the accelerating behavior of cosmic fluid , detected by super novae ia used as standard candles . up to now ,",
    "no final answer on new particles has been given at fundamental level so dark energy and dark matter constitute a puzzle to be solved in order to achieve a self - consistent picture of the observed universe .",
    "@xmath3-gravity , where @xmath3 is a generic function of the ricci scalar @xmath0 , comes into the game as a straightforward extension of gr where further geometrical degrees of freedom are considered instead of searching for new material ingredients @xcite . from an epistemological point of view",
    ", the action of gravity is not selected _ a priori _ , but it could be `` reconstructed '' , in principle , by matching consistently the observations @xcite .",
    "this approach can be adopted considering any function of the curvature invariants as @xmath4 , @xmath5 and so on .",
    "several of these extended models reproduce solar system tests so they are not in conflict with gr experimental results but actually extend them enclosing new features that could be , in principle , observed@xcite .    from a genuine mathematical point of view",
    ", extended theories of gravity pose the problem to recover the well - established results of gr as the initial value problem @xcite , the stability of solutions and , in particular , the issue of finding out new solutions .",
    "as it is well known , beside cosmological solutions , spherically and axially symmetric solutions play a fundamental role in several astrophysical problems ranging from black holes to active galactic nuclei . extended gravities , to be consistent with results of gr , should comprise solutions like schwarzschild and kerr ones but could present , in general , new solutions of physical interest . due to this reason , methods to find out exact and approximate solutions are particularly relevant in order to check if observations can be framed in extended theories of gravity @xcite .",
    "recently , the interest in spherically symmetric solutions of @xmath3-gravity is growing up . in @xcite",
    ", solutions in vacuum have been found considering relations among functions that define the spherical metric or imposing a costant ricci curvatue scalar .",
    "the authors have reconstructed the form of some @xmath3-models , discussing their physical relevance . in @xcite ,",
    "the same authors have discussed static spherically symmetric solutions , in presence of perfect fluid matter , adopting the metric formalism . they have shown that a given matter distribution is not capable of globally determining the functional form of @xmath3 .",
    "others authors have discussed in details the spherical symmetry of @xmath3-gravity considering also the relations with the weak field limit .",
    "exact solutions are obtained for constant ricci curvature scalar and for ricci scalar depending on the radial coordinate . in particular , it can be considered how to obtain results consistent with gr assuming the well - known post - newtonian and post - minkowskian limits as consistency checks @xcite .    as we will discuss below , a general method to find out rotating black hole solutions",
    "can be achieved by performing a complex coordinate transformation on the spherical black hole metrics . since the discovery of the kerr solution @xcite",
    ", many attempts have been made to find a physically reasonable interior matter distribution that may be considered as its source .",
    "for a review on these approaches see @xcite .",
    "though much progress has been made , results have been generally disappointing .",
    "as far as we know , nobody has obtained a physically satisfactory interior solution .",
    "this seems surprising given the success of matching internal spherically symmetric solutions to the schwarzschild metric .",
    "the problem is that the loss of a degree of symmetry makes the derivation of analytic results much more difficult .",
    "severe restrictions are placed on the interior metric by maintaining that it must be joined smoothly to the external axially symmetric metric .",
    "further restrictions are placed on the interior solutions to ensure that they correspond to physical objects .    furthermore since the axially symmetric metric has no radiation field associated with it , its source should be also non - radiating .",
    "this places even further constraints on the structure of the interior solution @xcite .",
    "given the strenuous nature of these limiting conditions , it is not surprising to learn that no satisfactory solution to the problem of finding sources for the kerr metric has been obtained . in general",
    ", the failure is due to internal structures whose physical properties are unknown .",
    "this shortcoming makes hard to find consistent boundary conditions .",
    "newman and janis showed that it is possible to obtain rotating solutions ( like the kerr metric ) by making an elementary complex transformation on the schwarzschild solution  @xcite . this same method has been used to obtain a new stationary and axially symmetric solution known as the kerr - newman metric  @xcite .",
    "the kerr - newman space - time is associated to the exterior geometry of a rotating massive and charged black - hole . for a review on the newman - janis method to obtain both the kerr and kerr - newman metrics see  @xcite .    by means of very elegant mathematical arguments ,",
    "schiffer et al .",
    "@xcite have given a rigorous proof to show how the kerr metric can be derived starting from a complex transformation on the schwarzschild solution .",
    "we will not go into details of this demonstration , but point out that the proof relies on two main assumptions .",
    "the first is that metric belongs to the same algebraic class of the kerr - newman solution , namely the kerr - schild class @xcite .",
    "the second assumption is that metric corresponds to an empty solution of the einstein field equations @xcite .",
    "it is clear , by the generation of the kerr - newman metric , that all the components of the stress - energy tensor need to be non - zero for the newman - janis method to be successful .",
    "such a transformation can be extended to @xmath3-gravity as discussed in @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the strong gravity regime is another way to check the viability of these theories @xcite . in general the formation and the evolution of stars",
    "can be considered suitable test - beds for extended theories of gravity .",
    "considering the case of @xmath3-gravity , divergences stemming from the functional form of @xmath3 may prevent the existence of relativistic stars in these theories @xcite , but thanks to the chameleon mechanism , introduced by khoury and weltman @xcite , the possible problems jeopardizing the existence of these objects may be avoided @xcite . furthermore , there are also numerical solutions corresponding to static star configurations with strong gravitational fields @xcite where the choice of the equation of state is crucial for the existence of solutions .",
    "it is also important to stress that @xmath3-gravity has interesting applications also in stellar astrophysics and could contribute to solve several puzzles related to observed peculiar objects ( e.g. stars in the instability strips , protostars , etc .",
    "@xcite ) , structure and star formation @xcite .",
    "furthermore some observed stellar systems are incompatible with the standard models of stellar structure .",
    "we refer to anomalous neutron stars , the so called `` magnetars '' @xcite with masses larger than their expected volkoff mass .",
    "it seems that , on particular length scales , the gravitational force is larger or smaller than the corresponding gr value .",
    "for example , a modification of the hilbert - einstein lagrangian , consisting of @xmath6 terms , enables a major attraction while a @xmath7 term gives a repulsive contribution @xcite .",
    "understanding on which scales the modifications to gr are working or what is the weight of corrections to gravitational potential is a crucial point that could confirm or rule out these extended approaches to gravitational interaction .",

    "some considerations are in order .",
    "star formation is one of the best settled problems of modern astrophysics .",
    "however , some shortcomings emerge as soon as one faces dynamics of diffuse gas evolving into stars and star formation in galactic environment .",
    "one can deal with the star formation problem in two ways : @xmath391 we can take into account the formation of individual stars and @xmath392 we can discuss the formation of the whole star system starting from interstellar clouds @xcite . to answer these problems it is very important to study the interstellar medium ( ism ) and its properties.the ism physical conditions in the galaxies change in a very wide range , from hot x - ray emitting plasma to cold molecular gas , so it is very complicated to classify the ism by its properties .",
    "however , we can distinguish , in the first approximation , between @xcite :    * * diffuse hydrogen clouds*. the most powerful tool to measure the properties of these clouds is the 21 cm line emission of hi .",
    "they are cold clouds so the temperature is in the range @xmath393 k , and their extension is up to @xmath394 kpc from galactic center .",

    "they are the best sites for star formation , despite the mechanism of formation does not recover the star formation rate that would be @xmath404 @xcite . * * hii regions*. they are ism regions with temperatures in the range @xmath405 k , emitting primarily in the radio and ir regions . at low frequencies , observations are associated to free - free electron transition ( thermal bremsstrahlung ) .",

    "@xcite , we have calculated the jeans mass in the newtonian and @xmath3 cases .",
    "tab.[table2 ] shows the results . in all cases",
    "we note a substantial difference between the classical and @xmath3 value .",
    "we can conclude that , in @xmath3-scenario , molecular clouds become sites where star formation is strongly supported and more efficient .",
    "black hole solutions can be find out , in principle , in any extended theory of gravity . here , we have shown that exact solutions can be achieved in @xmath3-gravity starting from symmetry considerations . in particular , the existence of noether symmetries allow to find exact solutions .",
    "such solutions can be eventually classified as black holes .",
    "in particular , we have shown that the newman - janis method , used to derive rotating black hole solutions in gr , works also in @xmath3-gravity . in principle , it could be consistently applied any time a spherically symmetric solutions is derived .",
    "the method does not depend on the field equations but directly works on the solutions that , a posteriori , has to be checked to fulfill the field equations .",
    "the key point of the method is to find out a suitable complex transformation which , from a physical viewpoint , corresponds to the fact that we are reducing the number of independent killing vectors . from a mathematical viewpoint ,",
    "it is useful since allows to overcome the problem of a direct search for axially symmetric solutions that , in @xmath3-gravity , could be extremely cumbersome due to the fourth - order field equations .",
    "we have to stress that the utility of generating techniques is not simply to obtain a new metric , but a metric of a new spacetime with specific properties as the transformation properties of the energy - momentum tensor and killing vectors . in its original application , the newman - janis procedure transforms an einstein - maxwell solution ( reissner - nordstrom ) into another einstein - maxwell solution ( kerr - newman ) . as a particular case ( setting the charge to zero ) it is possible to achieve the transformation between two vacuum solutions ( schwarzschild and kerr ) .",
    "also in case of @xmath3-gravity , new features emerge by adopting such a technique . in particular , it is worth studying how certain features of spherically simmetric metrics , derived in @xmath3-gravity , result transformed in the new axially symmetric solutions for black holes .",
    "for example , considering the @xmath3 spherically symmetric solution studied here , the ricci scalar evolves as @xmath422 and then the asymptotic flatness is recovered .",
    "let us consider now the axially symmetric metric achieved by the newman - janis method .",
    "the parameter @xmath423 indicates that the spherical symmetry ( @xmath177 ) is broken .",
    "such a parameter can be immediately related to the presence of an axis of symmetry and then to the fact that a killing vector , related to the angle @xmath424 , has been lost . to conclude",
    ", we can say that once the vacuum case is discussed , more general spherical metrics can be transformed in new axially symmetric metrics adopting more general techniques @xcite , that would allow us to have the best configurations to describe the black hole dynamics .    a part the mathematical interest in finding out new solutions",
    ", such results could have remarkable applications , at least as toy models , in the study of self - gravitating systems .",
    "we have shown that the stellar theory as well as the jeans analysis of instability and collapse can be dramatically altered if one adopt @xmath3-gravity instead of gr .",
    "the study has been performed starting from the newtonian limit of @xmath3-field equations .",
    "since the field equations satisfy in any case the bianchi identity , we can use the conservation law of energy - momentum tensor .",
    "in particular adopting a polytropic equation of state relating the mass density to the pressure , we derive the _ modified lan - emden equation _ and its solutions for @xmath425 which can be compared to the analogous solutions coming from the newtonian limit of gr .",
    "when we consider the limit @xmath268 , we obtain the standard hydrostatic equilibrium theory coming from gr .",
    "a peculiarity of @xmath3-gravity is the non - viability of gauss theorem and then the _ modified lan - emden equation _ is an integro - differential equation where the mass distribution plays a crucial role .",
    "furthermore the correlation between two points in the star is given by a yukawa - like term of the corresponding green function .",
    "these solutions have been matched with those coming from gr and the corresponding density radial profiles have been derived . in the case",
    "@xmath290 , we find an exact solution , while , for @xmath291 , we used a perturbative analysis with respect to the solution coming from gr .",
    "it is possible to demonstrate that density radial profiles coming from @xmath3-gravity analytic models and close to those coming from gr are compatible .",
    "this result rules out some wrong claims in the literature stating that @xmath3-gravity is not compatible with self - gravitating systems .",
    "obviously the choice of the free parameter of the theory has to be consistent with boundary conditions and then the solutions are parameterized by a suitable `` wave - length '' @xmath426 that should be experimentally fixed .",
    "the next step is to derive self - consistent numerical solutions of _ modified lan - emden equation _ and build up realistic star models where further values of the polytropic index @xmath217 and other physical parameters , e.g. temperature , opacity , transport of energy , are considered .",
    "interesting cases are the non - relativistic limit ( @xmath304 ) and relativistic limit ( @xmath306 ) of completely degenerate gas . these models are a challenging task since , up to now , there is no self - consistent , final explanation for compact objects ( e.g. neutron stars ) with masses larger than volkoff mass , while observational evidences widely indicate these objects @xcite .",
    "in fact it is plausible that the gravity manifests itself on different characteristic lengths and also other contributions in the gravitational potential should be considered for these exotic objects . as we have seen above , the gravitational potential well results modified by higher - order corrections in the curvature . in particular , it is possible to show that if we put in the gravitational action other curvature invariants also repulsive contributions can emerge @xcite .",
    "these situations have to be seriously taken into account in order to address several issues of relativistic astrophysics that seem to be out of the explanation range of the standard theory .    for this purpose",
    ", we have analyzed the jeans instability mechanism , adopted for star formation , considering the newtonian approximation of @xmath3-gravity .",
    "the related boltzmann - vlasov system leads to modified poisson equations depending on the @xmath3-model .",
    "in particular , considering eqs . and , it is possible to get a new dispersion relation where instability criterion results modified ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the leading parameter is @xmath120 , i.e. the second derivative of the specific @xmath3-model .",
    "standard newtonian jeans instability is immediately recovered for @xmath379 corresponding to the hilbert - einstein lagrangian of gr . in fig .",
    "[ fig : jeans ] , dispersion relations for newtonian and a specific @xmath3-model are numerically compared .",
    "the modified characteristic length van be given in terms of the classical one .",
    "both in the classical and in @xmath3 analysis , the system damps the perturbation .",
    "this damping is not associated to the collisions because we neglect them in our treatment , but it is linked to the so called landau damping @xcite .",
    "a new condition for the gravitational instability is derived , showing unstable modes with faster growth rates .",
    "finally we can observe the instability decrease in @xmath3-gravity : such decrease is related to a larger jeans length and then to a lower jeans mass .",
    "we have also compared the behavior with the temperature of the jeans mass for various types of interstellar molecular clouds ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass ] ) . in tables",
    "[ table1 ] and [ table2 ] we show the results given by this new limit of the jeans mass for a sample of giant molecular clouds . in our model the limit ( in unit of mass ) to start the collapse of an interstellar cloud is lower than the classical one advantaging the structure formation .",
    "real solutions for the jean mass can be achieved only for @xmath387 and this result is in agreement with cosmology @xcite . in particular , the condition @xmath387 is essentials to have a well - formulated and well - posed cauchy problem in @xmath3-gravity @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth noticing that the newtonian value is an upper limit for the jean mass coinciding with @xmath105 .",
    "this analysis is intended to indicate the possibility to deal with ism collapsing clouds under different assumptions about gravity .",
    "it is important to stress that we fully recover the standard collapse mechanisms but we could also describe proto - stellar systems that escape the standard collapse model . on the other hand , this is the first step to study star formation and physical black holes in alternative theories of gravity ( see also @xcite ) . from an observational point of view , reliable constraints can be achieved from a careful analysis of the proto - stellar phase taking into account magnetic fields , turbulence and collisions . finally , addressing stellar systems by this approach could be an extremely important to test observationally @xmath3-gravity .",
    "moreover , the approach developed here admits direct generalizations for other modified gravities , like non - local gravity , modified gauss - bonnet theory , string - inspired gravity , etc . in these cases , the constrained poisson equation may be even more complicated due to the presence of extra scalar(s ) in non - local or string - inspired gravity .",
    "developing further this approach gives , in general , the possibility to confront the observable dynamics of astrophysical objects ( like stars ) with predictions of alternative gravities .",

    "<S> in the last ten years , increasing attention has been devoted to extended theories of gravity with the aim to understand several cosmological and astrophysical issues such as the today observed accelerated expansion of the universe and the presence of dark matter in self - gravitating structures . </S>",
    "<S> some of these models assume modifications of general relativity by adding higher order terms of curvature invariants like the ricci scalar @xmath0 , the ricci tensor @xmath1 and the riemann tensors @xmath2 , or the presence of suitable scalar fields like the former brans - dicke theory . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore natural to ask for black hole solutions in this context since , on the one hand , black holes signatures may be the test - bed to compare new models to the einstein gravity ; on the other hand , they may lead to rule out models which disagree with observations . </S>",
    "<S> although black holes are one of the most striking predictions of general relativity , they remain one of its least tested concepts . </S>",
    "<S> electromagnetic observations allow indirectly to infer their existence , but direct evidences remains elusive . in the next decade , data coming from very long - baseline interferometry and gravitational wave detectors should allow to image and study black holes in detail . </S>",
    "<S> such observations will test general relativity in the non - linear and strong - field regimes where data are currently lacking . </S>",
    "<S> testing strong - field features of general relativity is of utmost importance to physics and astrophysics as a whole . </S>",
    "<S> this is because the black holes solutions , such as the schwarzschild and kerr metrics , enter several calculations , including accretion disk structure , gravitational lensing , cosmology and gravitational waves theory . </S>",
    "<S> these black hole solutions could indicate strong - field departures from general relativity with deep implications for the still unknown fundamental theory of gravity . beside the physical interest , </S>",
    "<S> black hole solutions represent a very active area for mathematical physics investigations . here </S>",
    "<S> we review the problem of black holes in a particular class of extended theories of gravity , the so called @xmath3-gravity , discussing some resolution techniques , obtaining exact solutions and comparing results with standard general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we discuss the problems of hydrostatic equilibrium and stellar structure in the context of @xmath3-gravity showing that new features could emerge . </S>",
    "<S> the observation of such features could both explain the physics of exotic self - gravitating objects and constitute a signature for extended theories of gravity . </S>"
