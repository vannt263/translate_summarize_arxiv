    "<S> for this purpose , we focus on ( 4,0,0 ) bragg peak , which has a @xmath23-spacing @xmath64 . in a classical second order </S>",
    "<S> magnetic phase transition , one would expect that spin - spin correlation length increases on cooling and diverges at @xmath14 , while the underlying lattice correlations @xmath65 remain long - ranged and temperature independent . surprisingly , our neutron larmor diffraction measurements on stress free bafe@xmath6ni@xmath7as@xmath2 reveal that the lattice distortion ( @xmath38 ) of the system shows no visible anomaly across @xmath13 ( @xmath66 k ) , but increases continuously on cooling below @xmath13 before collapsing abruptly below @xmath14 ( @xmath67 k ) [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(f ) ] @xcite . similarly , instead of being a temperature independent constant , the lattice correlation length @xmath65 decreases on cooling , changing smoothly from 2500   around @xmath31150 k to 1000   just above @xmath14 with no anomaly across @xmath13 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> figure 3(g ) compares temperature dependence of the lattice orthorhombicity @xmath39 for bafe@xmath6ni@xmath7as@xmath2 without applying any external strain and in strain released sample . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> , we see that af order induces a large change in lattice orthorhombicity , consistent with previous x - ray scattering work @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , bafe@xmath6ni@xmath7as@xmath2 exhibits a strong magnetoelastic coupling near @xmath14 .    </S>",
    "<S> figure 4 summarizes temperature dependence of the resistivity anisotropy , defined as @xmath68 , for uniaxial strained and stress free bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 with @xmath69 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to previous work @xcite , we find that temperature dependence of the resistivity anisotropy in uniaxial strained samples can be well described by a curie - weiss functional form above the strain free @xmath13 and below @xmath3 [ see solid lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a)-4(d ) ] . when uniaxial strain is released , the resistivity anisotropy and its appearance temperature @xmath4 are dramatically reduced . nevertheless , it is clearly present above @xmath13 in the tetragonal phase . </S>",
    "<S> for strain free samples cooled from high - temperature paramagnetic tetragonal phase , there are no resistivity anisotropy above @xmath13 [ see green data points in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the small resistivity anisotropy below @xmath14 is due to slight imbalance in the twin domain populations .    </S>",
    "<S> to understand the observed resistivity anisotropy behavior , we consider a microscopic scenario as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(e)-4(h ) . in the low - temperature uniaxial strained detwinned state , the undoped and underdoped bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 form a single domain homogeneous magnetic ordered state with intrinsic resistivity anisotropy that is weakly electron - doping dependent [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(a)-4(d ) , @xmath32 ] . upon releasing the uniaxial strain , </S>",
    "<S> the sample becomes partially detwinned af ordered state with reduced resistivity anisotropy [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(f ) ] . on further warming to temperatures above @xmath14 and @xmath13 , </S>",
    "<S> these materials exhibit a large lattice distortion across @xmath14 but much less anomaly across @xmath13 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3(f ) and 3(g ) ] @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that the resistivity anisotropy seen in the narrow temperature region above @xmath13 is due to the remnant local lattice distortions arising from the large magnetoelastic coupling across @xmath14 [ fig . </S>",
    "<S> 4(g ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the system finally relaxes to the true homogeneous tetragonal state without resistivity anisotropy at temperatures above @xmath4 . since our neutron larmor diffraction measurements showed no additional anomaly in lattice parameters and lattice distortion above @xmath13 </S>",
    "<S> , we conclude that there is no thermodynamic phase transition at @xmath3 and @xmath4 in agreement with recent heat capacity measurements @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the resistivity anisotropy seen in the stress free detwinned samples below @xmath4 on warming across @xmath14 is then due to local spin nematic correlations and associated lattice distortions arising from the magnetoelastic coupling through the collinear af state below @xmath14 . the absence of such effect in strain free sample on cooling confirms this scenario and the weakly first order nature of the magnetic transition .    in summary , by using a specially designed in - situ detwinning device </S>",
    "<S> , we have discovered the presence of resistivity anisotropy in the tetragonal phase of stress free bafe@xmath0ni@xmath1as@xmath2 below @xmath4 , a temperature lower than @xmath3 associated with resistivity anisotropy in uniaxial strained sample @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our neutron diffraction experiments confirm the partially detwinned state in the stress free sample , thus indicating that the observed resistivity anisotropy arises from local spin nematic correlations and lattice distortions . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , our neutron larmor diffraction experiments on lightly electron - doped bafe@xmath6ni@xmath7as@xmath2 indicate lattice distortions across @xmath14 and @xmath13 with no evidence of another phase transition above @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> these results thus establish that resistivity anisotropy in the tetragonal phase arises from the magnetoelastic coupling associated with static af order , suggesting the presence of local ising - nematic spin correlations and lattice distortions in the tetragonal state of electron - doped iron pnictides near @xmath14 .    </S>",
