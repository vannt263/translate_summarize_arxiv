    "impurity plays a crucial role in determining the behavior of many measurable properties of cuprate superconductors @xcite , such as the quasiparticle transport in the superconducting ( sc ) state .",
    "this follows from a fact that the physical properties of cuprate superconductors in the sc state are extreme sensitivity to the impurity effect than the conventional superconductors due to the finite angular - momentum charge carrier cooper pairing with the d - wave symmetry @xcite .",
    "the single common feature is the presence of the cuo@xmath5 plane @xcite , and it seems evident that the unusual behaviors of cuprate superconductors are dominated by this cuo@xmath5 plane @xcite .",
    "experimentally , over twenty years measurements of electrodynamic properties at microwave energies have provided rather detailed information on the quasiparticle transport of cuprate superconductors @xcite , where the nodal quasiparticle spectrum contains most of the features expected for weak - limit impurity scattering .",
    "the early microwave conductivity measurements @xcite showed the microwave conductivity spectrum is cuo@xmath5 plane isotropic . however , the recent development of a sufficient number of fixed - energy cavity perturbation system to map out a coarse microwave conductivity spectrum @xcite allowed to resolve additional features in the microwave conductivity spectrum . among these new achievements is the observation of an anisotropy in the microwave conductivity spectrum of the highly ordered ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , where the well pronounced difference in intensity and lineshape in the @xmath4-axis and @xmath3-axis directions is remarkable .",
    "although the anisotropy in the microwave conductivity spectrum of the ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is well - established experimentally @xcite , its full understanding is still a challenging issue .",
    "theoretically , based on a phenomenological bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) formalism with the d - wave sc gap function , it has been argued in the mean - field level that the interband transitions produce a strongly anisotropic feature @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that the cuo@xmath5 bilayer may lead to two nearly identical contributions to both @xmath4-axis and @xmath3-axis microwave conductivities @xcite , since the splitting between bonding and antibonding combinations of the planar wavefunctions is expected to be weak @xcite . in our earlier work @xcite",
    "based on the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism @xcite , the effect of the extended impurity scattering potential on the quasiparticle transport in the non - ortho - ii phase of cuprate superconductors has been discussed within the nodal approximation of the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes , and the obtained energy and temperature dependence of the microwave conductivity are consistent with the experimental data in the non - ortho - ii phase of cuprate superconductors @xcite . in the d - wave sc state of cuprate superconductors , the characteristic feature is the existence of four nodal points @xmath6 $ ] ( in units of inverse lattice constant ) in the brillouin zone @xcite , where the sc gap function vanishes , therefore the cuo@xmath5 plane currents are mainly carried by nodal quasiparticles , and the quasiparticle transport properties of cuprate superconductors in the sc state are largely governed by the quasiparticle excitations around the nodes . since the gap nodes lie close to the diagonals of the brillouin zone , these quasiparticle excitations carry both @xmath4-axis and @xmath3-axis currents , then the microwave conductivity should be cuo@xmath5 plane isotropic . however , the ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 is a very special cuprate sc material , and is characterized by a periodic alternative of filled and empty @xmath3-axis cuo chains @xcite . in particular",
    ", the recent experimental measurements @xcite unambiguously establish that the @xmath3-axis cuo chain induced impurity is the dominant source of the anisotropy in the microwave conductivity spectrum of the ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "this experimental result @xcite also implies that the @xmath3-axis cuo chain in the ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 induced impurities lead to an anisotropy of the extended impurity scattering potential in the cuo@xmath5 planes . in this paper",
    "we show explicitly if the effect of the anisotropy of the extended impurity scattering potential induced by the @xmath3-axis cuo chain is considered within the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism , one can reproduce some main features of the anisotropy in the microwave conductivity spectrum observed @xcite experimentally on the ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the basic formalism , where the bsc - like green s function under the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism is dressed via the extended anisotropy impurity scattering . within this framework ,",
    "we calculate explicitly the @xmath4-axis and @xmath3-axis microwave conductivities based on the nodal approximation of the quasiparticle excitations and scattering processes . the energy and temperature dependence of the @xmath4-axis and @xmath3-axis microwave conductivities of the ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2",
    "are presented in sec .",
    "iv is devoted to a summary .",
    "the basic element of cuprate superconductors is two - dimensional cuo@xmath5 planes @xcite as mentioned above .",
    "it has been shown that the essential physics of the doped cuo@xmath5 plane is properly accounted by the @xmath7-@xmath8 model on a square lattice @xcite , @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) is the electron creation ( annihilation ) operator , @xmath13 is spin operator , and @xmath14 is the chemical potential .",
    "this @xmath7-@xmath8 model is subject to an important local constraint @xmath15 to avoid the double occupancy @xcite , which can be treated properly in analytical calculations within the charge - spin separation ( css ) fermion - spin theory @xcite , where the constrained electron operators are decoupled as @xmath16 and @xmath17 , with the spinful fermion operator @xmath18 describes the charge degree of freedom together with some effects of spin configuration rearrangements due to the presence of the doped charge carrier itself , while the spin operator @xmath19 describes the spin degree of freedom , then the electron local constraint for the single occupancy is satisfied in analytical calculations . in this css fermion - spin representation , the @xmath7-@xmath8 model ( 1 ) can be expressed as , @xmath20 with @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the charge carrier doping concentration . for a understanding of the sc state properties of cuprate superconductors ,",
    "the kinetic energy driven sc mechanism has been developed @xcite , where the interaction between charge carriers and spins from the kinetic energy term in the @xmath7-@xmath8 model ( 2 ) induces the charge carrier pairing state with the d - wave symmetry by exchanging spin excitations , then the electron cooper pairs originating from the charge carrier pairing state are due to the charge - spin recombination , and their condensation reveals the sc ground - state . in particular , it has been shown that this sc state is a conventional bcs like with the d - wave symmetry @xcite , so that the basic bcs formalism with the d - wave sc gap function is still valid in quantitatively reproducing all main low energy features of the sc coherence of quasiparticles , although the pairing mechanism is driven by the kinetic energy by exchanging spin excitations .",
    "following our previous discussions @xcite , the electron green s function in the sc state can be obtained in the nambu representation as , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the unit matrix , @xmath25 and @xmath26 are pauli matrices , other notations are defined as same as in ref .",

    "however , this cuo@xmath5 plane isotropic case is broken in the presence of the @xmath3-axis cuo chain induced impurities in the ortho - ii yba@xmath0cu@xmath1o@xmath2 , since the cuo chain induced impurity scattering potential can be described by an anisotropic potential in the cuo@xmath5 planes @xcite .",
    "this simply assumes that the screened coulomb potential created by the cuo chain induced impurities produces a footprint sensed by quasiparticles moving in the cuo@xmath5 planes @xcite . after incorporating this @xmath3-axis cuo chain",
    "induced anisotropy impurity scattering into the extended isotropy impurity scattering potential , the total scattering potential @xmath37 need be evaluated in four possible cases as shown in fig .",
