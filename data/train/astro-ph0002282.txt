    "the orion nebula is one of the most studied star  forming regions in the galaxy .",
    "the ionizing stars of the orion nebula ( the trapezium stars , the hottest of which is @xmath1  ori  c , o6 ) have eroded a bowl  shaped   region into the surface of the orion molecular cloud .",
    "the orion bar is the limb  brightened edge of this bowl where an ionization front is progressing into the molecular cloud .",
    "it is seen as an elongated structure at a position angle of approximately 60 .",
    "the orion nebula extends to the north .",
    "the trapezium stars are located at an angular distance of approximately 2.3 arc minutes from the bar , corresponding to 0.35 pc at a distance of 500 pc .",
    "the molecular cloud extends to the other side of the bar , but also to the back of the orion nebula .",
    "the bright star @xmath0  ori  a ( o9.5vpe ) lies near the bar , and is clearly in front of the molecular cloud since its color excess is only e(b  v ) @xmath2 0.2 mag .    figs . 1 and 2",

    "the emission in one of the mid - ir bands ( hereafter called the aromatic infrared bands , aibs ) at 6.2   traces the orion bar ( an edge - on photodissociation region or pdr ) .",
    "the aibs are usually strongly emitted by pdrs .",
    "the trapezium region was avoided because of possible detector saturation .",
    "pioneering infrared observations by stein & gillet ( @xcite ) and ney et al .",
    "( @xcite ) discovered interstellar silicate emission near 10   in the direction of the trapezium .",
    "this was confirmed by becklin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who also noticed extended silicate emission around @xmath0  ori  a. since that time , interstellar silicate emission has been found by the infrared space observatory ( iso ) in the   region n 66 of the small magellanic cloud ( contursi et al .  in preparation ) and in a few galactic compact   regions ( cox et al .  in preparation ) and photodissociation regions ( pdrs , jones et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the emission consists of two broad bands centered at 9.7 and 18 , which show little structure and are clearly dominated by amorphous silicates .",
    "we report in the present article iso observations of the orion bar and of a part of the orion nebula made with the circular variable filter of the iso camera ( cam - cvf ) which allowed imaging spectrophotometry of a field @xmath3 at low wavelength resolution ( r @xmath2 40 ) .",
    "we also use an iso short  wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) observation which provides higher  resolution ( @xmath4 ) spectroscopy at a position within the   region ( see fig .",
    "this spectrum was taken as part of the mpewarm guaranteed - time program .",
    "we show here that these new iso data confirm and extend previous observations of the amorphous silicate emission and also give evidence for emission by crystalline silicates .",
    "2 of this paper describes the observations and data reduction . in sect .",
    "3 , we discuss the emission of dust and gas . the silicate emission is characterized in section 4 through modelling of the observed continuum ir emission . finally , conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "5 . our observations also give information on the fine  structure lines and on the aibs .",
    "this will be presented in appendices a and b respectively .",
    "imaging spectrophotometry was performed with the 32@xmath532 element mid - ir camera ( cam ) on board the iso satellite , using the circular variable filters ( cvfs ) ( see cesarsky et al .",
    "@xcite for a complete description ) .",
    "the observations employed the 6   per pixel field - of - view of cam .",
    "full scans of the two cvfs in the long - wave channel of the camera were performed with both increasing and decreasing wavelength .",
    "the results of these two scans are almost identical , showing that the transient response of the detector was only a minor problem for these observations .",
    "the total wavelength range covered is 5.15 to 16.5   and the wavelength resolution @xmath6 .",
    "10@xmath50.28 s exposures were added for each step of the cvf , and 7 more at the first step in order to limit the effect of the transient response of the detectors .",
    "the total observing time was about 1 hour .",
    "the raw data were processed as described in cesarsky et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , with improvements described by starck et al .  ( @xcite ) using the cia software .",
    "the new transient correction described by coulais & abergel ( @xcite ) has been applied but the corrections introduced are minimal , as mentioned above .",
    "the bright star @xmath0  ori  a is visible in the maps of several spectral components and has been used to re  position the data cube .",
    "this involved a shift of only 2 .",
    "the final positions are likely to be good to 3   ( half a pixel ) .",
    "all the maps presented here were obtained from the cvf data cube and have approximately the same resolution : namely , 6   pixels at the short wavelengths increasing to about 8   at 15 ; see appendix c for more details .    in several of these maps",
    "a faint emission can be seen on the south ",
    "east part of the isocam field of view .",
    "this feature does not correspond to anything conspicuous in published images of the region , in particular in the near  ir images of marconi et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "it is a spurious feature due to multiple reflections of the strong trapezium between the detector and the cvf filter wheel , as shown by the isocam ray tracing studies of okumura ( @xcite )",
    ".    the complete sws scan ( 2.4 - 46 ) was reduced with the latest version of sws - ia running at the institut dastrophysique spatiale .",
    "calibration files version cal-030 were used .",
    "3 presents the sws spectrum ( @xmath7 ) obtained inside the   region at the position indicated on fig .",
    "3 also shows the comparison of the sws spectrum with that of the cam - cvf pixels averaged in the sws aperture .",
    "the agreement between these spectra is excellent , well within 20 percent for the continuum .",
    "the spectra towards the   region of the orion nebula are shown in figs . 3 and 4 . the cam - cvf spectrum of fig .",
    "3 is representative of the whole field because cvf spectra obtained at different positions in the   region and around @xmath0  ori  a look qualitatively similar ( compare figs . 3 and 10 which show the cvf spectra of different pixels ;",
    "note particularly the rising long wavelength portion of the spectra ) .",
    "+ in the sws spectrum , a large number of unresolved lines from atoms , ions and molecules are visible .",
    "we note the pf@xmath8 recombination line of hydrogen ( emitted by the warm , ionized gas of the   region ) and the molecular hydrogen pure rotation lines s(2 ) and very faintly s(3 ) and s(5 ) ( stemming from the cooler , molecular pdr gas ) .",
    "the simultaneous presence of these lines reflects the variety of physical conditions present along the line of sight .",
    "clearly , we are looking at emission from the   region mixed with some emission from the background pdr .",
    "these unresolved lines are briefly discussed in appendix a. +    the other striking fact of the sws spectrum is the strong continuum peaking at about 25 .",
    "it is emitted by warm dust in the   region , but dust from the background pdr probably also contributes .",
    "the broad emission bands of amorphous silicates centered at 10 and 18   are visible .",
    "the classical aibs at 6.2 , 7.7 , 8.6 , 11.3 and 12.7   dominate the mid - ir part of the spectrum . as discussed by boulanger et al .",
    "@xcite , the mid - ir spectrum can be decomposed into lorentz profiles ( the aibs ) and an underlying polynomial continuum .",
    "maps of the various aibs constructed in this way all show the same morphology originating mainly from the pdr gas in the orion bar ( see appendix b ) .",
    "we will hereafter use the 6.2-band as representative of the behaviour of the aibs .",
    "5 we compare the behaviour of the mid - ir continuum emission and of the aibs . clearly , the aib emission is concentrated in the orion bar whereas the 15.5-continuum emission extends throughout the whole cam field and shows a local peak around @xmath0  ori  a ( note that the mid - ir emission around this star is foreground because the star lies in front of the nebula ) . the continuum emission , however , appears to peak towards @xmath1  ori  c , outside the region observed with isocam .",
    "the contrast in the emission morphology between the bands and continuum can be interpreted in terms of the photodestruction of the aib carriers in the hard uv - radiation field of the   region .",
    "the aib carriers must be efficiently destroyed while the larger grains are much more resistant ( e.g.  allain et al .  1996 ) .",
    "we detail the modelling of the dust thermal emission in the next section .      to account for the observed sws spectra",
    ", we have calculated the thermal equilibrium temperature of dust in the orion   region as a function of distance of the orion bar from the trapezium stars , assuming that @xmath1 ori c ( an o6 star ) dominates the local radiation field .",
    "we use the optical constants of the amorphous astronomical silicate of draine ( @xcite ) and of the amorphous carbon ac1 of rouleau & martin ( @xcite ) . assuming typical interstellar grain sizes ( e.g. draine & lee @xcite )",
    ", we find a temperature range of 85145  k for amorphous silicates and a range of 110200  k for amorphous carbon , corresponding to grains of radius 1500 and 100    respectively , at a distance of @xmath9  pc from @xmath1 ori c ( the distance of the orion bar to the trapezium stars ) .",
    "using , for simplicity , discrete dust temperatures consistent with those calculated above ( t@xmath10 = 80  k and 130  k , t@xmath11 = 85  k and 155  k ) we are able to satisfactorily model the continuum emission spectrum from the dust in the orion   region at the position of the iso - sws spectrum . in fig .",
    "4 we show the calculated emission spectrum from our model where we adopt the carbon / silicate dust mass ratios of draine & lee ( @xcite ) . in the calculated spectrum",
    "we have included the emission from carbon grains at 300  k , containing @xmath12 1 percent . of the total carbon dust mass , in order to fit the short wavelength continuum emission .",
    "the hot carbon grain emission mimics that of the stochastically - heated very small grains ( vsgs , dsert et al .",
    "the 300  k temperature represents a mean of the temperature fluctuations for these small particles in the radiation field of @xmath1 ori c , and therefore indicates a lower mass limit of @xmath12 1 percent for the mass of the available carbon in vsgs .    the results of our model show that the emission feature in the 10   region is dominated by amorphous silicates at temperatures of the order of 130  k , but that there may also be a small contribution from amorphous carbon grains in the 12   region ( fig .",
    "we also note broad `` features '' in the sws spectrum , above the modelled continuum in fig .",
    "4 , at @xmath13 , @xmath14   and longward of 32 , that are not explained by our model .",
    "these features bear a resemblance to the major bands at 19.5 , 23.7 and 33.6   seen in the crystalline forsterite spectra of koike et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and of jaeger et al .  ( @xcite ) .",
    "bands in these same wavelength regions were noted by jones et al .",
    "( @xcite ) in the sws spectra of the m17   region and were linked with the possible existence of crystalline mg - rich olivines in this object .",
    "thus , similar broad emission bands are now observed in the 1540  wavelength region of the sws spectra of two   regions ( orion and m17 ) .",
    "these bands resemble those of the crystalline mg - rich silicate forsterite .",
    "another band at 9.6   is probably due to some sort of crystalline silicate , and will be discussed in more details in the next section .",
    "this dust model is simple  minded but emphasizes dust spectral signatures in the mid - ir continuum which was the main aim here .",
    "more detailed modelling treating temperature fluctuations and taking into account the grain size distribution is underway ( jones et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the broad continua that lie above the model fit ( i.e. @xmath14   and @xmath15  32 , fig .",
    "4 ) can be associated with crystalline silicate emission bands .",
    "this seems to be a robust conclusion of this study .",
    "the features are too narrow to be explained by single - temperature blackbody emission and are therefore likely to be due to blended emission features from different materials .",
    "unfortunately , having only one full sws spectrum and cvf spectra that do not extend beyong 18 , we are unable to say anything about the spatial variation of these broad bands in the orion region .",
    "interestingly , broad plateaux in the @xmath13   region have been associated with large aromatic hydrocarbon species containing of the order of a thousand carbon atoms ( van kerckhoven et al .",
    "however , in this study the integrated intensity of the @xmath13   plateaux do vary by a factor of up to 10 relative to the aromatic carbon features shortward of 13 .",
    "thus , the origin of these broad emission features does remain something of an open question at this time .",
    "to delineate the spatial extent of the 10-silicate emission conspicuously visible in fig . 3 and 4 , we proceed as follows .",
    "we start with the spectrum towards @xmath0  ori  a , which shows the most conspicuous silicate emission and we represent the aibs by lorentz profiles , see fig . 6 ( top ) .",
    "next we subtract them from the cvf spectra .",
    "the remaining continuum has the generic shape of a blackbody on top of which we see the broad bands corresponding to the silicate emission , fig .",
    "6 ( middle ) . finally , we subtract a second order polynomial from the continuum thus obtaining the well known silicate emission profile at that position , fig .",
    "6 ( bottom ) .",
    "the profile thus obtained is then used as a scalable template to estimate the emission elsewhere , see appendix c for more details .    on top of the broad band of amorphous silicate centered near 9.7   we see a band centered at nearly 9.6 , which we ascribe to crystalline silicates ( jaeger et al .",
    "@xcite ) . this band was also used as a scalable template as explained above and in appendix c. finally , the s(5 ) rotation line of h@xmath16 at 6.91   is present and is probably blended with the [ ] line at 6.99 .    in fig .",
    "7 , we see that the spatial distribution of the 9.7-feature of amorphous silicate is quite similar to that of the 15.5-continuum .",
    "the 15.5   continuum emission includes a strong contribution from silicates ( see fig .",
    "4 ) , but a peak in the silicate emission around @xmath0  ori  a is also evident .",
    "the silicate emission is thus predominantly due to larger grains .",
    "the narrower 9.6  feature is mapped in fig .",
    "we note its similarity to the distribution of the 9.7  broad band : this fact lends support to our assignation of this band to crystalline silicate . +    due to the low spectral resolution of the cam - cvf , however , the 9.6   feature will certainly blend with the s(3 ) pure rotational line of molecular hydrogen - if present . to check this",
    "we have compared our 9.6   map to that of molecular hydrogen in its fluorescent vibrational line 1@xmath17 s(1 ) ( 2.12 ) .",
    "courtesy of p.p .",
    "van der werf ( van der werf et al .",
    "@xcite ) , we reproduce in fig .",
    "9 the map of the fluorescent molecular hydrogen emission . this latter correlates better with the aib emission as traced by the 6.2-feature ( bottom figure ) than it does with the tentative crystalline silicate emission ( top ) , namely they both peak along the bar .",
    "this is not surprising because the h@xmath16 and aib emitters require shielding from far - uv radiation to survive .",
    "conversely , the 9.6  silicate feature is stronger where h@xmath16 is weak as can be seen around @xmath0  ori  a. in addition , the h@xmath16 s(3 ) rotational line at 9.66   is detected in the iso - sws spectrum of the orion bar presented in verstraete et al .",
    "( 1999 , in preparation ) with an intensity of @xmath18 w m@xmath19 sr@xmath20 .",
    "this value is a factor of 16 below the median flux of the 9.6   feature in our map , namely @xmath21 w m@xmath19 sr@xmath20 .",
    "we can thus safely conclude that our 9.6-emission predominantly originate from silicates",
    ". a confirmation of the identification of the 9.6   band with a crystalline silicate dust component would be possible if a second signature band were seen in our spectra . the sws spectrum ( fig .",
    "4 ) shows only broad emission bands that are difficult to characterise , and additionally , the chacteristic crystalline olivine band in the @xmath22   region ( e.g.  jaeger et al .",
    "@xcite ) , if present , is blended with the 11.2   aromatic hydrocarbon feature . additionally , most of the chacteristic crystalline bands fall longward of the cvf spectra .",
    "thus , it is difficult to self - consistently confirm the 9.6   band identification with the presented data . in summary ,",
    "emission in the 9.7  band of amorphous silicate emission exists everywhere inside the orion   region .",
    "previously , amorphous silicate emission had only been seen in the direction of the trapezium ( stein & gillett @xcite ; forrest et al .",
    "@xcite ; gehrz et al .",
    "we may assume that the 18   band is also widely present in the region , as witnessed by the single sws spectrum ( fig .",
    "4 ) and by the generally rising long wavelength end of isocam spectra ; the two spectra shown , figs",
    ". 3 and 10 are quite representative of the steeply rising continuum longward of 15 .",
    "the case of @xmath0  ori  a is particularly interesting because the geometry is simple and therefore allows quantitative calculations . moreover , the thermal radio continuum , the recombination lines and the fine  structure lines are faint in the neighbourhood of this star ( felli et al .",
    "@xcite ; pogge et al .  @xcite ; marconi et al .",
    "@xcite , and the present paper , fig .",
    "2 ) . @xmath0  ori  a is classified as an o9.5vpe star and shows emission lines ( see e.g. weaver & torres ",
    "dodgen @xcite ) .",
    "it is a spectroscopic binary and an x - ray source .",
    "there is little gas left around the star and the observed silicate dust ( fig .",
    "8) is almost all that is visible of the interstellar material left over after its formation . indeed , o stars are not known to produce dust in their winds which are probably much too hot , so that the silicates we see here must be of interstellar origin .",
    "the mid  ir continuum observed towards @xmath0  ori  a can be accounted for by combining emission of warm silicate and carbon grains ( see fig .",
    "the model continuum was obtained in the same way as for the sws observation ( see fig .",
    "4 ) and with the same assumptions . the grain temperatures are consistent with the heating of interstellar grains by the strong radiation field of the star .    as discussed above , the band near 9.6 @xmath23 m ( fig .",
    "6 bottom and fig .",
    "8) may be due to crystalline silicates , any contribution of the s(3 ) h@xmath16 line to this band is minor .",
    "another band at 14 @xmath23 m ( see figs",
    ". 4 and 10 ) might also be due to crystalline silicates . amongst the crystalline silicates",
    "whose mid  ir absorption spectra are shown by jaeger et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , synthetic enstatite ( a form of pyroxene ) might perhaps match the @xmath0 ori a spectrum .",
    "the interest in the possible presence of crystalline silicates around this star is that they would almost certainly be of interstellar origin , pre  dating the formation of the star .",
    "observations at longer wavelengths are needed for a definitive check of the existence of crystalline silicates and for confirming their nature .",
    "such observations do not exist in the iso archives and should be obtained by a future space telescope facility .",
    "we obtained a rather complete view of the infrared emission of the orion nebula and its interface with the adjacent molecular cloud .",
    "the most interesting results are the observation of amorphous , and possibly crystalline , silicates in emission over the entire   region and in an extended region around the bright o9.5vpe star @xmath0 ori a. we have fitted the mid  ir continuum of the   region and around @xmath0 ori a with the emission from amorphous silicate and amorphous carbon grains at the equilibrium temperatures predicted for the grains in the given radiation field .",
    "this shows that both types of grains can survive in the harsh conditions of the   region .",
    "a number of bands ( the 9.6  bump seen in fig . 6",
    "; the excess 14  emission indicated in figs . 4 and 10 )",
    "suggest emission from crystalline silicates ( essentially forsterite ) in the   region .",
    "crystalline silicates may also exist around @xmath0 ori a , but further , longer wavelength observations are required to confirm their presence .",
    "+ do the observed crystalline silicates result from processing of amorphous silicates in the   region or in the environment of @xmath0 ori a ?",
    "silicate annealing into a crystalline form requires temperatures of the order of 1000  k for extended periods ( hallenbeck et al .",
    "the dust temperatures observed in the   region and around @xmath0 ori a are considerably lower than this annealing temperature .",
    "one might however invoke grain heating following grain  grain collisions in the shock waves that are likely to be present in the   region .",
    "however , grain fragmentation rather than melting is the more likely outcome of such collisions ( jones et al .",
    "it is probable that the crystalline silicates observed here were already present in the parent molecular cloud , and probably originate from oxygen  rich red giants .",
    "+ emission by both amorphous and crystalline silicates has been observed with iso around evolved stars ( waters et al .",
    "@xcite ; voors et al .",
    "the crystalline silicates there must have been produced locally by annealing of amorphous silicates .",
    "gail & sedlmayr ( @xcite ) have shown that this is possible , and that both amorphous and crystalline forms can be released into the interstellar medium . however , there is no evidence for absorption by crystalline silicates in the general interstellar medium in front of the deeply embedded objects for which amorphous silicate absorption is very strong ( demyk et al .  1999 ,",
    "dartois et al .",
    "@xcite ) . consequently",
    ", crystalline silicates represent only a minor fraction compared to amorphous silicates .",
    "it would be difficult to detect the emission from a small crystalline component of dust in the diffuse interstellar medium because the dust is too cool ( t@xmath24k ) to emit strongly in the @xmath25 m wavelength region .",
    "observations of   regions and bright stars provide the opportunity of observing this emission due to the strong heating of dust .",
    "emission from amorphous and crystalline silicates is seen around young stars ( waelkens et al .",
    "@xcite ; malfait et al .",
    "@xcite ) as well as in comets ( crovisier et al .",
    "there are also silicates in meteorites , but their origin is difficult to determine because of secondary processing in the solar system . crystalline silicates in comets , and perhaps in interplanetary dust particles believed to come from comets ( bradley et al .",
    "@xcite ) , must be interstellar since the material in comets never reached high temperatures . however , the silicates probably experienced changes during their time in the interstellar medium .",
    "it is interesting to note that while very small grains of carbonaceous material exist , there seem to be no very small silicate grains in the interstellar medium ( dsert et al .",

    ", @xcite ) and/or gauss profiles , including a baseline , determined by a least square fitting algorithm ( _ method 2 _ ) . the strength of features not amenable to an analytical expression , like the suspected amorphous silicate emission ( see fig .",
    "6 ) has been estimated using the following method ( _ method 3 _ ) .",
    "we have constructed an emission template consisting of all the observed emission features , each one arbitrarily normalised to unit peak intensity , see fig . 13 .",
    "a least square computer code was then used to obtain , for each of the @xmath31 lines of sight , a set of multiplying coefficients for each feature present in the template plus a global parabolic baseline so as to minimize the distance between the model and the data points .",
    "the number of free parameters is then eleven `` line intensities '' and three polynomial coefficients , for a total of 14 free parameters to be determined from 130 observed spectral points per line of sight .",
    "the main drawback of this method is that it does not allow for varying line widths or line centres ; however , given the low resolution of isocam s cvf this is not a serious drawback .",
    "we have found that integrated line emission estimated from methods 2 and 3 give results that agree to within 20 percent ; numerical integration of lorentzian line strengths , on the other hand , badly underestimates the energy carried in the extended line widths and hence this method has not been used ."
