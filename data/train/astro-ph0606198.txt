    "important roles played by galactic mergers and binary black holes in galaxy evolution was first recognized several decades ago @xcite .",
    "a large number of subsequent studies have addressed the problems of evolution of binary black holes in post - merger galaxies ( see @xcite for a recent review ) and connection between mergers and nuclear activity in galaxies @xcite .",
    "the correlations observed between the masses , @xmath1 , of nuclear black holes in galaxies , the and masses , @xmath2 , @xcite and velocity dispersions , @xmath3 , of the host stellar bulges @xcite suggest a connection between the formation and evolution of the black holes and galaxies .",
    "growth of black holes in galactic centers is self - regulated by outflows generated during periods of supercritical accretion @xcite .",
    "this mechanism offers a plausible explanation for the observed @xmath1@xmath4 relation @xcite .",
    "supermassive black holes are expected to form in the early universe , with multiple sbh likely to be common in galaxies @xcite . however , the detailed connection between the sbh evolution and the nuclear activity is somewhat elusive .",
    "observational evidence for binary sbh is largely indirect ( see @xcite and references therein ) , with only two double galactic nuclei ( ngc6240 @xcite and 3c75 @xcite ) observed directly in early merger systems , at large separations .",
    "there are no convincing cases for secondary black holes within active galaxies , although some of them may be hiding among the extranuclear x - ray point sources detected by rosat and chandra @xcite .",
    "this implies that the activity of secondary companions is quenched at early stages of the merger , possibly due to disruption of the accretion disk .",
    "the nuclear activity depends strongly on the availability of accreting material in the immediate vicinity of a black hole , and agn episodes are believed to last for @xmath5@xmath6yr .",
    "this is likely to be smaller than typical lifetimes of nuclear binary black holes in galaxies @xcite .",
    "this suggests that nuclear binary black holes systems may provide a mechanism necessary for instilling and supporting high accretion rates over timescales implied by large - scale relativistic outflows produced in agn @xcite .",
    "evolutionary stages of bbh systems can also be connected phenomenologically to different types of agn @xcite . here , an analytical model is proposed that connects the evolution of central sbh in to the nuclear activity in galaxies .",
    "the main constituents of the model are : 1 )  binary system of supermassive black holes , 2 )  accretion disk , 3 )  central stellar bulge .",
    "the bbh is described by the masses @xmath7 , @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) of the two black hole and their separation @xmath10 .",

    "the central bulge extends over a region of radius @xmath17 and has a mass @xmath2 ( @xmath18 ) and a velocity dispersion @xmath3 .",
    "the evolution of the bbh is described in terms of _ reduced mass _ , @xmath19 , and _ reduced separation _ , @xmath20 of the binary .",
    "the reduced mass is defined as @xmath21 .",

    "the reduced separation is given by @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the separation at which the two black holes become gravitationally bound ( this happens at @xmath30 ) .",
    "binary systems have @xmath31 , while unbound pairs of sbh have @xmath32 .      two sbh in a merger galaxy are expected to form a binary system at a separation @xmath33 , with an initial orbital speed @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "assuming that the relative speed of the two black holes reaches asymptotically its keplerian value , the _ approach speed _ can be defined as @xmath35 .",
    "both black holes are assumed to have active accretion disks at early stages of the merger .",
    "the separations @xmath36 at which the accretion disks are disrupted and eventually destroyed can be estimated for each of the two black holes by equating the approach speed to the keplerian velocity at the outer edge of the disk : @xmath37 .",
    "this yields @xmath38 .",

    "the resulting reduced separation is @xmath39 , where @xmath40 $ ] and @xmath41 is the collimation angle of the outflow carrying the excess energy and angular momentum from the immediate vicinity of the black hole .",
    "this corresponds to a critical mass @xmath42 for which an equal mass binary system will undergo disk destruction at the time of gravitational binding ( at @xmath43 . in systems with @xmath44 the destruction of accretion disk around the secondary will occur before the formation of a gravitationally bound system . for typical values of @xmath16 and @xmath45@xmath46",
    ", @xmath47 reaches @xmath48@xmath49 .",
    "it implies that most of active galaxies formed by galactic mergers should undergo destruction of the disk around the secondary bh before or during the formation of a gravitationally bound systems .",
    "since masses of the nuclear black holes in galaxies rarely exceed @xmath50 , this offers a natural explanation for the observed lack of active galaxies with double nuclei , since it predicts that _ in most galaxies with binary black hole systems the secondary companion will be inactive_.    denoting @xmath51 , the disruption distances are @xmath52 for the primary and secondary black hole , respectively .",

    "it shows that the most powerful agn with @xmath71 should be found in binary sbh with nearly equal masses of the primary and secondary black holes .",

    "the model described above can be applied effectively to high - resolution optical studies and data from large surveys that can be used to obtain estimates of the nuclear luminosities and black hole masses in active galaxies .",
