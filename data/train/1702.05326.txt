    "controlling the lifetime and basin of attraction of chimera states is therefore crucial in practical application , and some progress in this direction has been made only recently @xcite .",
    "it is well known that generally time - delayed feedback or coupling is a powerful method to control the stability in nonlinear systems @xcite and networks @xcite .    in this paper , we investigate the influence of time delay on chimera states in delay - coupled oscillator networks , specifically , the dynamical regimes and the lifetime of amplitude chimeras in a ring network of stuart - landau oscillators with nonlocal time - delayed coupling .",

    "note that the sawtooth - wave modulation of the delay does not have a significant influence on the various regimes if compared to the constant delay case ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "there is , however , an occasional appearance of partially incoherent states at small values of coupling strength @xmath9 and different values of the number of nearest neighbours @xmath10 .",
    "they survive the simulation time , but the main region of amplitude chimeras around @xmath129 and small @xmath10 is mostly unchanged with increasing modulation amplitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the square - wave delay modulation is rather interesting , since in this case by increasing the modulation amplitude , the domains corresponding to partially incoherent states become drastically reduced , almost disappearing for larger values of modulation amplitude .",
    "the impact of the modulation of the coupling delay on the network dynamics in the square - wave case becomes more visible in the parameter plane of the coupling range @xmath10 and the amplitude of delay modulation @xmath122 for constant coupling strength @xmath98 ( fig . [ fig12 ] ) .",
    "one can clearly see that increasing the modulation amplitude @xmath122 results in a sequence of appearance and disappearance of the amplitude chimera regions .",
    "such behavior is a characteristic feature of systems under square - wave delay modulation , and it has already been reported , for instance , in variable - delay feedback control with respect to the sequence of stability islands for successful fixed - point control @xcite .         +              +          and modulation amplitude @xmath122 , for time - varying delay coupling with a square - wave modulation , and constant value of the coupling strength @xmath98 .",
    "color scale and other parameters as in fig .",
    "[ fig10].,title=\"fig : \" ] +      finally , we consider distributed - delay coupling .",
    "it has been shown that a time - varying delay system with a high - frequency modulation of the delay time is effectively equivalent to a distributed - delay system with a related delay distribution in the interval of delay variation , and this holds both analytically and numerically with respect to the _ steady - state solutions _ of the dynamical equations of the delayed system @xcite . with this in mind , to check if this still holds for other dynamical states of the network , we aim to investigate distributed - delay coupling kernels which correspond to the ones for the time - varying delayed coupling in the previous subsection in the high - frequency limit of the delay modulation .",
    "thus , we choose a uniform distribution kernel : @xmath130\\\\ \\\\ 0 , & \\text{elsewhere } \\end{array } \\right . \\label{uniformkernel}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and a two - peak distribution kernel : @xmath131 where @xmath132 denotes the dirac delta function . in this case",
    "@xmath133 is the mean time delay of each distribution , and @xmath122 is the distribution width .",
    "they correspond to the average ( nominal ) delay value and the modulation amplitude , respectively , in the time - varying delay coupling case .",
    "the uniform distribution kernel corresponds to the high - frequency limit of a sawtooth - wave modulation of the coupling delay , and a two - peak distribution kernel represents the high - frequency limit of a square - wave modulation of the coupling delay . in the previous subsection ,",
    "the delay modulation frequency was chosen as @xmath134 , where @xmath135 is the intrinsic angular frequency of the uncoupled system .",
    "for those parameter values , the time - varying delay systems can be considered in the high - frequency limit , which is confirmed by our simulations .",
    "the resulting diagrams show that the network dynamics with distributed - delay coupling indeed corresponds to the dynamics with time - varying delay coupling with a high - frequency delay modulation .",
    "the resulting simulations show excellent matching of the maps of dynamic regimes and chimera lifetimes between the systems with distributed - delay coupling and time - varying delay coupling .",
    "since the dynamic regimes include various synchronous and asynchronous solutions , and combinations of both , we may conclude that approximating the high - frequency time - varying delay system by a distributed - delay system with a corresponding distribution kernel is quite general , extending well beyond steady state solutions of the complex network dynamics .",
    "in conclusion , we have investigated a ring network of stuart - landau oscillators coupled non - locally and through the real part of the complex variable .",
    "while analyzing various space - time patterns observed in this network , special attention has been payed to the transition from transient amplitude chimera states to phase - lag synchronization ( traveling waves ) and higher - order coherent structures .",
    "since the kuramoto order parameter can not be used as an indicator for such a transition , we have developed a measure which generalizes the global kuramoto mean - field order parameter and allows us to detect the transition from partially incoherent states ( e.g. , amplitude chimeras ) to any type of coherent structures .",
    "further , we have systematically studied the impact of time delay in the coupling on the dynamics of the system , comparing the results for constant , distributed , and time - varying delays with different modulation types .",
    "it has been shown that time delay changes the structure of dynamical regimes of the network in different parameter planes . in particular , time delay induces novel long - living patterns and significantly enhances the lifetime of transient states , specifically amplitude chimeras and related partially incoherent states .",
    "therefore , time delay can be used to control the lifetime of chimera states .",
    "additionally , time delay allows us to construct a desired type of amplitude chimera , for example , with a certain number of clusters or asymmetric cluster configuration . by appropriately adjusting the modulation of the coupling delay ( e.g. , square - wave modulation ) , or equivalently , changing the type and the parameters of the distributed - delay kernel ( e.g. , two - peak distribution kernel )",
    ", one can as well reduce the lifetime of amplitude chimeras .",
    "therefore , time delay in the coupling provides a powerful tool to control chimera patterns and their lifetimes in networks of coupled oscillators .",
    "another result that we found numerically is that at high - frequency delay modulation , the system with time - varying delay coupling is equivalent to distributed delay coupling with related delay - distribution kernels .",
