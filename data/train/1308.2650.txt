    "the entanglement of quantum states plays an important role in quantum information  @xcite . sharing an entangled quantum state , such as an einstein - podolski - rosen ( epr ) state  @xcite , makes it possible to perform quantum communication processes like quantum dense coding  @xcite , quantum teleportation  @xcite , quantum cryptography  @xcite and quantum computational tasks  @xcite .",
    "the experimental realizations of these protocols have been achieved in several physical systems such as photons , trapped ions , atoms in optical lattices , nuclear magnetic resonance , etc ,  @xcite .",
    "a wide range of theoretical and experimental schemes have been also proposed to generate , observe and/or exploit entanglement using macroscopic objects  @xcite .",

    "such strong cv  entanglement can therefore be exploited to implement quantum information tasks , like dense coding as studied in this paper .",
    "quantum dense coding , originally proposed for qubits  @xcite , provides a method by which two bits of information can be transmitted by sending only one qubit , provided that an entangled resource was previously shared by the parties .",
    "this idea was then extended to the cv setting where the rate at which information is transmitted can potentially be doubled by the use of epr states as the source of the entanglement  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show how we can successfully implement the protocol of cv dense coding by exploiting the optical entanglement at the output of an optomechanical cavity with a membrane - in - the - middle geometry  @xcite .",
    "this system consists of a high finesse cavity with two fixed - end mirrors and a perfectly - reflecting movable middle mirror , such as a dielectric membrane .",
    "we show the ability of the mechanical resonator to generate strong entanglement between two output optical beams , in a way which is robust with respect to the various optomechanical parameters , like the cavity damping rates , the laser input powers and bandwidths , and the temperature of the membrane .",
    "then , using this optical entanglement , we prove that we can perform dense coding with an information rate which closely approximates the dense coding capacity at small photon numbers , and is also good enough to outperform the ( one - way ) classical capacity of the noiseless quantum channel .",
