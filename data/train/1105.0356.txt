    "wvr is very remarkable because it connects two different theories : qcd with quarks and its pure - gauge , ym counterpart .",
    "the latter , however , has much higher characteristic temperatures than qcd with quarks : the  melting temperature \" @xmath82 where @xmath34 starts to decrease appreciably was found on lattice to be , for example , @xmath83 mev @xcite or even higher , @xmath84 mev @xcite . in contrast , the pseudocritical temperatures for the chiral and deconfinement transitions in the full qcd are lower than @xmath82 by some 100 mev or more ( e.g. , see ref .",

    "there is still more to the relatively high resistance of @xmath34 to temperature : not only does it start falling at rather high @xmath82 , but @xmath34 found on the lattice is falling with @xmath1 _ relatively _ slowly .",
    "in some of the applications in the past ( e.g. , see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , it was customary to simply rescale a temperature characterizing the pure - gauge , ym sector to a value characterizing qcd with quarks .",
    "( for example , refs . @xcite rescaled @xmath89 mev found by ref .",
    "@xcite to 150 mev ) .",
    "however , even if we rescale the critical temperature for melting of the topological susceptibility @xmath34 from @xmath82 down to @xmath2 , the value of @xmath87 still increases a lot @xcite for the pertinent temperature interval starting already below @xmath2 .",
    "this happens because @xmath34 falls with @xmath1 more slowly than @xmath79 .",
    "( it was found @xcite that the rescaling of @xmath82 would have to be totally unrealistic , to less than 70% of @xmath2 , in order to achieve sufficiently fast drop of the anomalous contribution that would allow the observed enhancement in the @xmath0 multiplicity . )",
    "these wvr - induced enhancements of the @xmath0 mass for @xmath90 were first noticed in ref .",
    "this reference used a concrete dynamical model ( with an effective , rank-2 separable interaction , convenient for computations at @xmath91 ) @xcite of low energy , nonperturbative qcd to obtain mesons as @xmath21 bound states in dyson - schwinger ( ds ) approach @xcite , which is a bound - state approach with the correct chiral behavior ( [ m2_prop_m ] ) of qcd .",

    "by contrast , in refs . @xcite and here , as well as earlier works @xcite at @xmath4 , a ds dynamical model is used ( as far as masses are concerned ) to obtain only the nonanomalous part of the light pseudoscalar meson masses ( where the model dependence is however dominated by their almost - goldstone character ) , while the anomalous part of the masses in the @xmath0-@xmath24 complex is , through wvr , dictated by @xmath149 . in this ratio ,",

    "[ chi1757_qq_f ] , and fig . 2 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and by fig . 6 in ref . @xcite .",
    "such @xmath33 behaviors are also in agreement with the @xmath1-dependence expected of the dchsb order parameter on general grounds : a pronounced fall - off around @xmath2  but exhibiting , in agreement with lattice @xcite , a smooth crossover pattern for nonvanishing explicit chsb , a crossover which gets slower with growing @xmath51 [ e.g. , compare @xmath33 with @xmath151 in fig .",

    "in contrast to the qcd topological susceptibility @xmath102 , the ym topological susceptibility and even its @xmath1-dependence @xmath34 , including its  melting \" temperature @xmath152 , can be extracted @xcite reasonably reliably from the lattice @xcite .",
    "thus , it was not modeled in ref .",
    "hence our assertion that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite unavoidably imply that the straightforward extension of wvr to @xmath3 is falsified by experiment @xcite , especially if one recalls that even the sizeable @xmath1-rescaling @xcite @xmath153 was among the attempts to control the @xmath0 mass enhancement @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we have also shown that there is a plausible way to avoid these problems of the straightforward , naive extension of wvr to @xmath3 , and this is the main result of the present paper . thanks to the existence of another relation , eq .",
    "( [ chitilde ] ) , connecting the ym quantity @xmath28 with qcd quantities @xmath102 and @xmath154 , it is possible to define a quantity , @xmath117 , which can meaningfully replace @xmath34 in finite-@xmath1 wvr .",
    "it remains practically equal to @xmath28 up to some 70% of @xmath2 , but beyond this , it changes following the @xmath1-dependence of @xmath155 . in this way , the successful zero - temperature wvr is retained , but the ( partial ) restoration of u@xmath14(1 ) symmetry [ understood as the disappearing contribution of the gluon anomaly to the @xmath0 ( @xmath67 ) mass ] is naturally tied to the restoration of the su@xmath14(3 ) flavor chiral symmetry and to its characteristic temperature @xmath2 , instead of @xmath152 .",
    "it is very pleasing that this fits in nicely with the recent _ ab initio _ theoretical analysis using functional methods @xcite , which finds that the anomalous breaking of u@xmath14(1 ) symmetry is related to dchsb ( and confinement ) in a self - consistent manner , so that one can not have one of these phenomena without the other .    of course",
    ", the most important thing is that this version of the finite-@xmath1 wvr , obtained by @xmath156 , is consistent with experiment @xcite for all reasonable strengths of @xmath1-dependence [ @xmath157 in eq .",

    "this should be noted because the @xmath67 mass inside the fireball is possibly even more relevant .",
