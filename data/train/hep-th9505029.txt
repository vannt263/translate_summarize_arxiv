    "we see that solutions of type ( i ) and ( ii ) require a finite interval of @xmath7 .",
    "that is , a finite @xmath97 corresponds to the initial situation @xmath98 , and after a finite string time @xmath99 we are to find ourselves at the point @xmath92 .",
    "these solutions correspond to strings that originate at the big bang [ @xmath100 , that collapse to zero size at @xmath92 in a finite cosmological time .",
    "the posterior oscillatory behaviour of the worldsheet is given by type ( iii ) solutions , for which the @xmath7 interval is also finite .",
    "the initial , type ( i ) or ( ii ) behaviour give rise to a unique type ( iii ) solution : equation ( [ ecuared ] ) is singular at the point @xmath92 .",
    "therefore , the solution is not unique : it is not determined by the initial value @xmath101 . as a matter of fact",
    ", it follows from the equation that for consistency @xmath102 .",
    "so the solutions to the equation are characterized by the second derivative of @xmath34 with respect to @xmath33 at the point @xmath103 : @xmath104 [ see eq.([eta0 ] ) ] . for the physical reasons previously mentioned ,",
    "it is clear that @xmath62 .",
    "after some manipulations , we can relate @xmath105 to physical quantities , namely the scale factor at this point , @xmath106 , and the energy of the string , @xmath107 , at this same instant , by use of the expression @xmath108 it follows that the solutions which reach this point are uniquely characterized by this physical quantity ( here , by solutions we mean solutions in the @xmath46 plane , which can each be mapped to a class of equivalent physical solutions for @xmath2 and @xmath109 ) .",
    "moreover , by the simultaneous mapping @xmath42 and @xmath41 , we can identify the solution in the physical strip that corresponds to an ingoing one with the calculated @xmath105 , and we see that for the solutions coming from @xmath91 to the point @xmath92 the continuing solution is of the oscillatory form iii ) .    therefore , no multistring behaviour with infinite number of strings is found .",
    "the reason being that all the solutions previously stated require a semiinfinite interval of string time , thus making it impossible to have more than two strings present in each solution .",
    "furthermore , in order to have even these two strings , it would be necessary to tie them together at @xmath110 .",
    "but the behaviour ( [ infuno ] ) forbids this ; from which it follows that within our ansatz no multistring solutions exist for @xmath68 .",
    "let us now analyze the exceptional solutions , the separatrices . both of them traverse a finite @xmath7 interval , and both of them correspond to strings originating at the big bang which collapse later on .",
    "the difference with the previously mentioned type ( i ) and",
    "( ii ) solutions is that whereas solutions ( i ) and ( ii ) exhibit dual to unstable behaviour [ see eq.([infuno ] ) ] and @xmath111 near @xmath77 , for the @xmath95 to @xmath92 separatrix there is also dual to unstable behaviour [ see eq.([unouno ] ) ] near @xmath95 but there @xmath112 . for the other one , @xmath96 to @xmath92 ,",
    "there is unstable behaviour near @xmath96 and @xmath113 as @xmath114 .",
    "there are two kinds of solutions in the physical strip : @xmath92 joined with @xmath96 , and @xmath92 joined to @xmath94 .",
    "additional to these , one finds a separatrix @xmath92 to @xmath95 .",
    "the @xmath7 interval for the @xmath92 to @xmath96 solutions is finite , and the strings thus described correspond to [ see eq.([incekn ] ) ] @xmath115 as @xmath116 , with @xmath117 .",
    "for these superinflationary spacetimes , there are then strings that start at @xmath118 $ ] and proceed to collapse , then continuing with an oscillatory motion ( the second class of solutions ) , similarly to what happens in the previous @xmath68 case .",
    "the separatrix is also analogous to the previous case , and no multistring solutions with an infinite number of strings are present in the ring solutions to the string equations of motion for these spacetimes .",
    "nonetheless , the argument against the existence of two - string solutions valid for @xmath68 fails in the case at hand , and two - string solutions exist within our ansatz for @xmath3 .",
    "this is depicted in figs .",
    "[ figdedos ] .",
    "this is due to the fact that the behaviour for @xmath119 is now given by eqns .",
    "( [ incekn ] ) .",
    "there are four kinds of solutions to equation ( [ ecuared ] ) in the physical strip , and four corresponding separatrices .",
    "the solutions join    * @xmath96 to @xmath95 , * @xmath95 to @xmath94 , * @xmath92 to @xmath94 , * @xmath92 to @xmath96 ,    with separatrices from the point @xmath120 to each of the points @xmath121 , @xmath95 , and @xmath96 .",
    "the @xmath96 point corresponds to @xmath122 , [ see eq.([infcero ] ) ] and is reached in finite @xmath7 time from the non - singular points connected to it .",
    "the points @xmath121 , as before , correspond to finite @xmath123 and @xmath64 , and @xmath124 .",
    "the points @xmath95 and @xmath120 , however , are more complicated .    as was mentioned before",
    ", the point @xmath120 is a solution of the equations of motion of the string that we had previously called the instanton for @xmath125@xcite .",
    "for this solution , invariant string size and string energy are both proportional to cosmological time .",
    "the point @xmath95 is a node for @xmath12 .",
    "writing eq .",
    "( [ ecuared ] ) as a system of two differential equations , we obtain the linearized solution close to this point : @xmath126 with @xmath127 some constant .",
    "it should be noticed that for @xmath53 this linearized solution involves a logarithmic term . from this equation , or from a direct analysis of eq .",
    "( [ ecuared ] ) we see that the leading behaviour of @xmath128 is given by @xmath129 . the value @xmath130 is reached by @xmath2 in a finite time from the non - singular points connected to @xmath95 .",
    "it is then clear that the interval @xmath55 of @xmath2 is obtained from a finite interval of string time , this being the prerequisite for the presence of multistring configurations .",
    "the point @xmath110 corresponds to the singular point @xmath120 and to @xmath131 . disregarding the separatrix for the moment ,",
    "consider a string that comes out of @xmath110 with positive @xmath132 ( i.e. , from @xmath133 ) . by following the evolution in the physical strip ,",
    "we see it eventually reaches @xmath65 , in finite string time .",
    "similarly if the starting point is @xmath134 : in its evolution in the @xmath46 plane , the string moves towards the point @xmath92 . by the usual identification , this is the same as the point @xmath94 , from which it comes out , and then either goes on to an oscillatory behaviour , as before , or is driven to the point @xmath95 , which is again reached in a finite time .    in",
    "what concerns the point @xmath120 , it can only be reached via the separatrices .",
    "it should be observed that it is a saddle point , and there are then two separatrices corresponding to @xmath119 as we approach this singular point , and another two such that @xmath135 .",
    "so , if we were to start from @xmath76 , we would reach the point @xmath120 through the more  horizontal \" separatrices ( either going through the points @xmath121 or not ) .",
    "this would happen in infinite string time .",
    "on the other hand , the separatrix connecting the singular point @xmath120 with @xmath95 corresponds to @xmath110 as we approach @xmath120 , and @xmath135 as we approach @xmath95 .",
    "this also needs infinite string time @xmath7 to take place .",
    "notice that an infinite string time @xmath7 is needed to reach the point @xmath120 .",
    "this is the only point which such property .",
    "the requirement for a multistring configuration is that both @xmath128 and @xmath136 be functions of @xmath7 such that        in principle , the very fact that a finite @xmath7 interval is mapped into the whole physical range allows us to write multistring configurations , and we have already shown some two - string solutions .",
    "for instance , in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] we portray a sequence of graphics for the case @xmath137 . first comes @xmath138 as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "note in this respect that only the absolute value of @xmath2 is relevant here ; and , furthermore , that eqs .",
    "( [ ecuaciones ] ) are invariant under the mapping @xmath139 .",
    "it should also be remarked that since the interval in @xmath7 is finite , more strings can be accommodated onto the same worldsheet .",
    "[ fig4]b shows @xmath109 as a function of @xmath2 for this solution : it is clear that at least two strings are present at the same time .",
    "both strings start at @xmath110 .",
    "their radius is the same only at @xmath110 , as depicted . to give a more complete picture , we next display @xmath58 for this solution .",
    "the question remains posed , whether something similar to what has been achieved in de sitter can be transposed to the more general context . in order to understand the problem",
    "better we shall study the results of @xcite,@xcite , translated into our formulation . as we have already pointed out , in de sitter",
    "spacetime @xmath33 is the proper size of the string , and @xmath140 , so we can use the expressions given in @xcite to obtain solutions to our equation ( [ ecuared ] ) . in particular , the hyperbolic solutions @xmath141 and @xmath142 ( @xcite ) are given by @xmath143 when we make use of the invariance under @xmath41 , @xmath42 , we see that this solution corresponds exactly to the separatrices in the physical strip , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , by considering also the solution @xmath144 notice that @xmath145 for the solution @xmath141 and @xmath146 for the solution @xmath142 .",
    "therefore , @xmath147 corresponds to @xmath141 and @xmath148 to @xmath142 .",
    "these two solutions , taken together , describe a total of three strings .",
    "one string solution corresponds to starting at the point @xmath149 and following @xmath150 downwards and to the left until it reaches @xmath92 , whence , by the usual mapping , we jump to @xmath94 and follow @xmath151 until the point @xmath149 is reached from the left .",
    "this requires infinite string time .",
    "another string solution is given by the rest of @xmath150 .",
    "that is starting at the point @xmath149 upwards until the point @xmath95 is reached ( in infinite string time ) , and then continuing by the line joining @xmath95 to @xmath96 , which needs finite time to be traversed .",
    "a further string corresponds to the separatrix from @xmath96 to the point @xmath149 , requiring infinite time , and which is given by @xmath151 .      in @xcite",
    "another class of multistring solutions is analyzed .",
    "their explicit expressions in terms of elliptic functions are not illuminating for our present purposes , but their asymptotic behaviour close to the point @xmath95 in the @xmath46 plane can be extracted , thus becoming amenable to comparison with eq .",
    "( [ unun ] ) .",
    "the result is that @xmath155 close to @xmath156 . on comparison with eq .",
    "( [ unun ] ) we see it tallies perfectly , as it should .",
    "we then conclude that for this type of multistring solutions to be present , we need some way of continuing solutions in the @xmath46 plane through the singular point @xmath95 .",
    "notice that this demand is not fulfilled by the already depicted two - string solutions , and that this way of obtaining / identifying multistring solutions is different from the continuation through @xmath157 ( i.e. @xmath110 ) previously considered .",
    "we can obtain multistring solutions by continuing solutions in the @xmath46 plane through the singular point @xmath95 ; that means computing a solution of eq .",
    "( [ ecuared ] ) which is well behaved through the point @xmath95 , and then use eqs .",
    "( [ etaz ] ) and ( [ integraltau ] ) with a judicious choice of integration constants for the two branches of the @xmath46 solution which come out of the point @xmath95 . in order to do this",
    "consistently it is required that there be continuous , well - behaved solutions in the @xmath46 plane through the singular point . from the leading behaviour in eqn .",
    "( [ unun ] ) we see that a necessary condition for this construction to work is that @xmath158 : for these spacetimes multistring solutions exist with more than two strings .",
    "another alternative for the consistent construction of multistring solutions is given from the examination of eq.([unouno ] ) , whence we see that @xmath2 and @xmath109 are real near @xmath95 in both sides of the point @xmath159 provided @xmath160 is an integer .",
    "hence we find real multistring solutions for @xmath161 where @xmath162 is a natural number .",
    "for @xmath163 we recover de sitter spacetime .",
    "in addition , we find from eq.([unouno ] ) near the point @xmath164 , @xmath165 this shows that the string always stays within the physical strip @xmath166 when @xmath7 goes beyond @xmath167 . in summary , an extra string appears for each point @xmath167 exhibiting the behaviour ( [ unouno ] ) near @xmath95 .",
    "the conclusion holds for generic solutions of the equations of motion , so the statement is even stronger than the mere existence of multistring solutions : for spacetimes with @xmath4 there exists a whole continuous class of multistring solutions to the ( classical ) string equations of motion .",
    "the conclusion is that multistring solutions will always be allowed for spacetimes with scalar factor of the form @xmath168 with @xmath1 . for",
    "@xmath1 two - string solutions will be possible . for @xmath4 an infinite number of strings can be present in multistring solutions . for @xmath158 multistring solutions are allowed with more than two strings .",
