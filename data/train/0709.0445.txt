    "disks are commonly observed around low - mass young stellar objects .",
    "they play a central role in star formation .",
    "it is generally believed that most of the mass of a sun - like star is assembled through a disk .",
    "the disks may also be responsible for regulating the rotation rates of young stars , through disk - stellar magnetosphere interaction @xcite , and for launching powerful jets and winds through the magnetocentrifugal mechanism @xcite .",
    "they are also the birthplace of planets .",
    "low - mass stars form in dense cores of molecular clouds .",
    "the cores are observed to rotate slowly @xcite .",
    "it is generally expected that the conservation of angular momentum during the core collapse would automatically lead to the formation of a rotationally supported disk .",
    "the expectation is borne out by both semi - analytic calculations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and numerical simulations ( ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; for reviews of early work , see and @xcite ) .",
    "however , the median value of the angular momenta measured for the cores @xcite is much higher than that inferred for circumstellar disks @xcite , by an order of magnitude or more .",
    "apparently , a considerable amount of angular momentum must be lost from the system in the process of core collapse and disk formation .",
    "a well - known mechanism for angular momentum removal is magnetic braking .",
    "magnetic fields are believed to play an important role in the formation of low - mass stars in relative isolation .",
    "polarization maps of dust continuum emission have revealed ordered magnetic fields in many dense cores ( see @xcite for a spectacular example ) .",
    "the field strengths have been determined through zeeman measurements in a number of them @xcite .",
    "the importance of magnetic field is usually measured by the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath2 in units of the critical value @xmath5 . for l1544 ,",
    "arguably the best studied starless core , @xcite inferred @xmath6 using the line - of - sight components of the field strength and column density . correcting for projection effects may reduce @xmath2 by a factor of 2 or more . in any case",
    ", there is ample observational evidence for both magnetic fields and rotation on the core scale .",
    "how the fields affect disk formation through magnetic braking of rotation is the focus of our investigation .",
    "previous studies of magnetic braking have mostly concentrated on the core formation phase of cloud evolution prior to the formation of a central object @xcite or stopped shortly after a `` seed '' star has formed (; see , however , recent work by and ) .",
    "what happens in the later , main protostellar mass accretion phase is less explored .",
    "* hereafter als03 ) followed numerically the protostellar collapse of moderately strongly magnetized cores ( with the dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath7 ) , and found that rotationally supported disks were not able to form in the ideal mhd limit .",
    "in hindsight , the suppression of disk formation is not too surprising , given that any disk that did form would be magnetically linked to a slowly rotating envelope of much larger moment of inertia and would lose its angular momentum quickly through magnetic braking .",
    "the braking is greatly enhanced by the equatorial pinching of field lines , which lengthens the magnetic lever arms ( als03 , * ? ? ?",
    "the catastrophic magnetic braking stood the traditional `` angular momentum problem '' of star formation on its head ; the braking can be so efficient as to inhibit disk formation for a moderate level of cloud magnetization in the ideal mhd limit .",
    "the question is : under what condition will the rotationally supported disk reappear ? to address this question , we go beyond als03 in two ways .",
    "first , we follow the collapse of magnetized , rotating dense cores using the spherical ( as opposed to the cylindrical ) version of the zeus2d mhd code @xcite .",
    "the spherical geometry enables us to better resolve the angular distributions of the matter and magnetic field at small radii , where most of the magnetic braking is expected to occur .",
    "second , we explore a wider range in the degree of cloud magnetization , @xmath8 .",
    "we find that the rotationally supported disk begins to be disrupted by magnetic braking for a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath9 , corresponding to an extremely weak field strength of order 1  @xmath10 g for typical parameters of low - mass cores .",
    "an implication is that @xmath11 is not the only criterion for judging the dynamical importance of a magnetic field , as is often assumed .",
    "a relatively weak field of @xmath12 can dominate the angular momentum evolution in the main accretion phase , because the field is amplified both by collapse and by rotation , and because the disk is braked over many rotation periods .",
    "indeed , we find that even in the weakest field case that we have considered ( @xmath13 ) , the field is amplified enough for the magnetic pressure to dominate the thermal pressure in the disk and its surrounding region , at least in 2d .",
    "the ideal mhd calculations provide a limiting case for calibrating calculations that include nonideal effects , particularly ambipolar diffusion , that are currently underway ( mellon & li , in preparation ) .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the problem setup and the code used for computation in   [ setup ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented and discussed in   [ standard ] through   [ rotation ] . in ",
    "[ discussion ] , we discuss the generic outcomes of the interplay between magnetic field and rotation during the protostellar mass accretion phase , including an extended region supported by a combination of toroidal magnetic field and rotation  a `` magnetogyrosphere .",
    "'' plausible observational evidence for such a structure in the class 0 source iram 04191 is discussed . the last section   [ conclusion ] contains the main conclusions .",
    "the early stage of low - mass star formation can be divided conceptually into two phases : a prestellar and a protostellar phase .",
    "the two are separated by a pivotal state @xcite , in which the central density formally goes to infinity .",
    "the pivotal state marks the end of core formation and the beginning of protostellar mass accretion .",
    "it is characterized by a large ( formally infinite ) density contrast between the center and the edge of the core . idealizing the pivotal ( t=0 ) state as a static singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , @xcite was able to obtain the well - known self - similar inside - out collapse solution for the protostellar phase of star formation .",
    "the present investigation is an extension of this work to those pivotal states that are both magnetized and rotating .",
    "the self - similarity of the sis is preserved in the presence of a dynamically important magnetic field , provided that the mass - to - flux ratio along each field line is constant .",
    "this condition , termed `` isopedic '' by @xcite , is roughly satisfied in ambipolar diffusion - initiated formation of dense cores out of strongly magnetized clouds @xcite . in more weakly magnetized clouds , the nearly scale - free prestellar contraction of the isothermal gas right before the point mass formation would also drag the magnetic field of the dense core into a nearly isopedic configuration .",
    "als03 found a family of self - similar solutions for the isopedically magnetized , rotating , singular isothermal pivotal state , which turned out to be toroids .",
    "they have carried out an initial study of the collapse of the pivotal cores described by such solutions .",
    "our investigation is a refinement and extension of theirs .",
    "the singular isothermal toroids ( sits ) are described , in a spherical polar coordinate system ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 ) , by @xmath17 @xmath18 @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the isothermal sound speed , which we take to be a constant , and the functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 describe the angular distributions of the density @xmath24 , magnetic flux @xmath25 , and rotation speed @xmath26 .",
    "we choose a fiducial value for the sound speed @xmath27  km / s ( somewhat higher than @xmath28  km / s , the sound speed of molecular gas at 10  k ) , to account for the ( typically subsonic ) nonthermal motions in dense cores @xcite .",
    "the choice of @xmath23 is discussed in depth in als03 .",
    "following their example , we set the rotation speed to a constant , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "the density and magnetic flux distributions @xmath21 and @xmath22 are determined from a set of coupled ordinary differential equations ( eqs .",
    "[ 14 ] through [ 17 ] of als03 ) and associated boundary conditions .",
    "the toroid solutions are characterized by two free parameters , @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the parameter @xmath30 specifies how fast the toroid rotates , while @xmath31 measures the amount of extra mass over the sis that is supported by magnetic fields and rotation . for a given @xmath30",
    ", @xmath31 controls the magnetic field strength .",
    "als03 considered a number of combinations of @xmath30 and @xmath31 , including @xmath32 and @xmath33 for @xmath34 , and @xmath35 and @xmath33 for @xmath36 .",
    "they found no evidence for a rotationally supported disk in any of their simulations , which have dimensionless mass - to - flux ratios ranging from @xmath37 to 10 .",
    "the result indicates that magnetic braking is very efficient , even for a magnetic field that is too weak to provide the bulk of support against self - gravity as a whole . on the other hand , a rotationally supported structure ( a disk or a ring )",
    "is expected in the limit of zero magnetic field . as the field strength increases from zero , there must be a transition from a regime where a rotationally supported structure is formed to a regime where it is completely suppressed .",
    "quantifying how this transition occurs is one of the main goals of the current investigation .",
    "we will first focus on a specific combination of parameters , @xmath38 and @xmath39 . for a fiducial isothermal sound speed @xmath27  km / s",
    ", the choice @xmath38 corresponds to an angular speed 3  km  s@xmath40  pc@xmath40 on the scale of @xmath41  pc , the typical radius of a dense core @xcite .",
    "the angular speed is within , although on the high side of , the range of velocity gradient inferred observationally by @xcite for a collection of nh@xmath42 cores ( see their fig .",
    "the relatively high rotation rate is chosen so that any rotationally support structure that may form is adequately resolved ; slower rotations are expected to be braked more easily . for @xmath38 ,",
    "the choice @xmath39 yields a dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio along each field line @xmath43 , consistent with the value inferred in the well - studied core l1544 @xcite , after correcting for projection effects .",
    "it produces a distribution of ( vertical ) magnetic field on the equator @xmath44    the rotating , magnetized singular isothermal toroid specified by @xmath38 and @xmath39 is shown in fig .",
    "[ initial ] . compared with the sis of the same isothermal sound speed",
    ", the sit has an enhanced density on the equator ( by a factor of 2.25 ) , due to extra support by the magnetic field and , to a lesser extent , rotation .",
    "the density is depleted in the polar region as matter settles along the field lines , producing the toroid appearance .",
    "the magnetic pressure dominates the thermal pressure in the evacuated polar region , within a half opening angle of @xmath45 of the axis .",
    "outside the region ( where most of matter resides ) , the thermal pressure dominates , with a plasma-@xmath46 on the equator .",
    "this magnetic field , although too weak to prevent the core from collapsing inside out , is strong enough to suppress the formation of a rotationally supported disk completely , as we demonstrate below ( see also als03 ) .",
    "indeed , even a much weaker magnetic field can modify the process of disk formation significantly in the ideal mhd limit .    to quantify the effects of field strength on magnetic braking and disk formation",
    ", we will reduce the field strength of the toroid shown in fig .",
    "[ initial ] by various constant factors everywhere , keeping the distributions of density and rotation speed fixed .",
    "we consider a wide range in the degree of magnetization , corresponding to @xmath13 , 200 , 133 , 80 , 40 , 20 , 13.3 , 8 , and 4 ( see table  1 ) . for reference , @xmath47 corresponds to a field strength of merely @xmath48 g on the core scale of @xmath41  pc ( for the fiducial value of sound speed ) , well below the median field strength ( @xmath49 ) in the cold neutral structures of hi gas @xcite .",
    "the field strength in dense cores of molecular clouds is unlikely to be as low as @xmath48 g , but we include cases with high values of @xmath2 to illustrate the transition from disk formation to suppression .",
    "for more turbulent ( perhaps massive star formation ) regions where the effective sound speed is much higher than 0.3  km / s , even the very large @xmath2 cases may become relevant , as we emphasize in the discussion section .",
    "a potential drawback of reducing the field strength without changing the distributions of density and rotation speed correspondingly at @xmath50 is that the initial configuration is out of force balance .",
    "the weakening of magnetic support will induce large - scale infall motions at times @xmath51 .",
    "infall motions on the core scale are observed , however , in a number of dense cores , including l1544 @xcite , with speeds typically of order half the sound speed .",
    "such a subsonic motion is present in our standard model to be discussed in depth in   3 .",
    "the reduction of field strength by a uniform factor everywhere at @xmath50 has the added advantage that the core collapse at @xmath52 remains self - similar , which provides a powerful check on the numerical solution .",
    "the same advantage is preserved when we reduce the fiducial rotation speed at @xmath50 by a uniform factor everywhere .",
    "the effects of initial rotation speed are discussed separately from those of initial field strength in   [ rotation ] .",

    "once a central point mass is formed , it will carry along with it a finite amount of magnetic flux .",
    "the trapped flux would formally produce a split magnetic monopole @xcite , causing the field strength to increase rapidly with decreasing radius ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "the rapid increase of field strength makes the courant condition associated with the alfvn speed prohibitively small close to the origin , where the grid is necessarily very fine , especially in the @xmath15 direction of the adopted spherical polar coordinate system .    to alleviate the numerical problem associated with the formation of a split magnetic monopole",
    ", we put the inner boundary of our computation domain at a fixed radius , @xmath56  cm , or @xmath57  au .",
    "we are unable to follow the evolution of the flow inside @xmath58 . however , for our adopted initial conditions , only a small fraction of the core mass has a low enough specific angular momentum to fall through the inner surface ( or `` inner hole '' ) without magnetic braking ; for the majority of the mass , extensive braking must occur in the computation domain to bring it to the inner surface . on this surface",
    ", we impose the standard `` outflow '' boundary conditions for the hydrodynamic quantities , i.e. , the density , energy and tangential ( to the surface ) velocity components are copied from the first active zones into the ghost zones along the radial direction .",
    "the radial velocities in the ghost zones are set to the lesser of the radial velocity in the first active zone and zero .",
    "these conditions are a standard feature already implemented in the zeus2d code @xcite that is employed for our simulations .",
    "the inner boundary conditions for the magnetic field require special attention .",
    "since the poloidal components of the magnetic field are evolved through the method of constrained transport @xcite in zeus2d , their boundary conditions are imposed on the electromotive force ( emf ) @xmath59 .",
    "we apply the standard zeus2d `` outflow '' boundary conditions on the emf to evolve the poloidal magnetic field .",
    "they produce a poloidal field that varies smoothly across the inner surface .",
    "the toroidal component of the magnetic field @xmath60 is not evolved through the method of constrained transport , and it is possible to impose boundary conditions on @xmath60 directly .",
    "we pick the simplest possible condition for the toroidal field in the ghost zones : @xmath61 .",
    "it is in effect a torque - free boundary condition .",
    "the choice is motivated in part by the realization that , by the time a piece of core material reaches the ( small ) inner surface , most of its angular momentum would have been stripped away already . the remaining angular momentum would be too little to significantly twist the strong ( split - monopole ) field lines that thread the inner surface ( see * ? ? ? * for a related discussion ) .",
    "other prescriptions are possible . for example",
    ", @xcite enforced the negative stress condition @xmath62 , whereas @xcite set the transverse components of the magnetic field to zero in their simulations of black hole accretion in a cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "we have experimented with other prescriptions for @xmath60 in the ghost zones , including copying values from the first active zones , which produced a somewhat stronger outflow along the axis compared with the torque - free case .",
    "the outflow is weak by the standard of the powerful jets and winds observed in young stars ( als03 ) , and will be easily masked by them . in any case",
    ", the simple torque - free boundary condition does not directly affect the braking of the bulk of the core material that accretes through the equatorial region ( including any disk that may form ) , the main focus of our investigation .",
    "boundary conditions are also required at the outer boundary .",
    "we set the outer radius of the computation domain to @xmath63  cm , slightly larger than the fiducial core radius of @xmath41  pc . within this radius , there is @xmath64  @xmath65 of material for the initial density distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ initial ] ( for @xmath27  km / s ) , more than enough to form a typical low - mass star of 0.5  @xmath65 . on the outer boundary",
    ", we impose the standard zeus2d `` outflow '' boundary conditions for all quantities , including @xmath60 .",
    "we assume that the core collapse remains symmetric with respect to the polar axis and the equatorial plane at all times .",
    "we adopt the standard zeus2d boundary conditions for the axis . to enforce the equatorial boundary conditions , we mirror all quantities ( including the three components of the magnetic field ) in the upper quadrant to the lower quadrant at the beginning of each time step , and evolve the governing equations in both quadrants . this implementation of equatorial boundary conditions , although somewhat more expensive than the one already in zeus2d , guarantees that the symmetry is enforced exactly .",
    "spontaneous symmetry breaking is observed in mhd simulations of black hole accretion @xcite .",
    "we will relax the equatorial symmetry in future 3d simulations .      for our axisymmetric problem , we use the zeus2d mhd code of @xcite in spherical polar coordinate system .",
    "the code is well suited for our investigation of magnetic braking , since the propagation of ( torsional ) alfvn waves is treated accurately with the method of characteristics .",
    "the main modification that we made to the code is to improve the method for obtaining the values of gravitational potential at the inner and outer boundaries ; they are needed for solving the poisson equation for the self - gravity of the material inside the computational domain .",
    "the method of multipole expansion in zeus2d performs poorly when mass is near a boundary and requires a large number of terms to accurately determine the gravitational potential .",
    "instead , we transform green s function from the multipole solution to an elliptic integral solution @xcite",
    ". we can then directly sum up the contributions of the masses in all active cells to the gravitational potential at a given location on the boundary , as in @xcite .",
    "we also modified the equation of state to change smoothly from isothermal to adiabatic around a critical density of @xmath66  gm  @xmath67 , to mimic the effects of radiation trapping at high densities .    to ensure good resolution on both large and small scales ,",
    "a logarithmically spaced grid is used in the radial direction .",
    "we divide the computational domain between the inner ( @xmath56  cm ) and outer radius ( @xmath68  cm ) into 120 shells , each having a width that is 6% larger than that of the shell interior to it .",
    "since both @xmath69 and @xmath70 vary linearly with the radius , the grid does not contain cells of large aspect ratios often seen in logarithmic grids in cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "the width of the first shell is @xmath71  cm , much smaller than the inner radius @xmath58 . in the polar direction ,",
    "we divide the region between the upper ( @xmath72 ) and lower axis ( @xmath73 ) into 119 uniform wedges , each with an opening angle of @xmath74 .",
    "as mentioned earlier , half of the grid ( between @xmath75 and @xmath76 ) is used for enforcing mirror symmetry across the equator .",
    "we begin the collapse calculation with a static , dense core . to initiate the collapse ,",
    "we add a point mass of @xmath77 ( where @xmath20 is the isothermal sound speed and @xmath58 the radius of the inner hole ) at @xmath50 .",
    "this mass is 1.5 times the mass enclosed within @xmath58 for a sis of sound speed @xmath20 , and slightly larger than that enclosed within the same radius for the magnetized sit shown in fig .",
    "[ initial ] ( @xmath78 ) . as the collapse proceeds ,",
    "the density is depleted preferentially in the polar region , where the magnetic field is strong and matter slides more or less freely along the field lines to the center ( als03 ) . to prevent the alfvn time step from dropping to prohibitively small values",
    ", we adopt a density floor of @xmath79  gm  @xmath67 on the inner half of the ( logarithmic ) radial grid ( within @xmath80  cm ) .",
    "the occasional use of density floor in the polar region is expected to have little dynamical effect , since the dynamics there are controlled by the magnetic field .",
    "we have experimented with different choices of the floor value and confirmed the expectation .",
    "the rotating , magnetized core that we adopt as the initial configuration for the collapse calculation is specified by two parameters : the dimensionless mass - to - flux ratio @xmath2 and the rotation speed @xmath30 in units of the sound speed .",
    "we will explore a wide range of values for @xmath2 in   [ fieldstrength ] and several values for @xmath30 in   [ rotation ] . in this section ,",
    "we focus on a model with a particular combination of parameters @xmath81 and @xmath38 ( model b7 in table  1 ) ; it serves as the standard against which others models are compared .",
    "the choice @xmath81 corresponds to a moderate field strength of @xmath82  @xmath10 g on the scale of the typical core radius @xmath41  pc ( not much higher than the median field strength of @xmath83  @xmath10 g inferred by @xcite for the cold neutral hi structures ) , and @xmath38 is chosen to ensure that any rotationally supported structure that may form is large enough to be adequately resolved .",
    "more importantly , it turns out that the combination yields a collapse solution that is roughly self - similar in time , as expected from the self - similar initial configuration adopted .",
    "the self - similarity gives us confidence on the numerically obtained solution .",
    "[ snap ] shows a snapshot of the standard model at a representative time @xmath84  sec ( or @xmath85  yrs after the initiation of collapse ) , comparable to the typical ages estimated for class 0 sources .",
    "the snapshots at other times are largely similar ( to be quantified below ) , which motivates us to introduce a set of dimensionless variables : @xmath86 if the collapse is strictly self - similar , the dimensionless density @xmath87 , magnetic field @xmath88 and velocity @xmath89 would be functions of the dimensionless self - similar radius @xmath90 and polar angle @xmath15 only , and the solution would look identical at different times except for a scaling factor . equation ( 5 ) can be used to obtain the dimensional units for any dimensionless quantity to be used below , particularly in figures ; the plotted quantities will be dimensionless unless noted otherwise explicitly .    broadly speaking , there are four dynamically distinct regions . at large ( cylindrical ) distances ,",
    "the core material collapses inward , dragging along magnetic field lines , particularly in the equatorial region .",
    "we term this region the `` collapsing envelope '' or `` region i. '' most of the collapsing material from the envelope is channeled into the equatorial region , forming a flattened `` pseudodisk '' or `` region ii . ''",
    "the pseudodisk is squeezed from above by an expanding `` magnetic bubble '' ( or `` region iii '' ) that lies at intermediate latitudes .",
    "the pseudodisk supports the bubble from below . on the other side of the bubble ,",
    "closer to the polar axis , lies `` region iv , '' where matter slides down well - ordered field lines , forming a low - density `` polar funnel . ''",
    "we consider the outflowing region near the axis part of `` region iii ; '' it is a continuation of the bubble to large distances .",
    "the boundaries between the various regions show up most clearly in the map of the magnetic twist , defined as the ratio of the toroidal to poloidal field strength @xmath91 ( see fig .",
    "[ twist ] ) . to be specific",
    ", we define the region dominated by the ( negative ) toroidal magnetic field ( i.e. , @xmath92 ) as the bubble ( `` region iii '' ) .",
    "it is surrounded by the polar funnel to the left , the collapsing envelope to the right , and the pseudodisk from below .",
    "the collapsing envelope is separated from the bubble by a `` magnetic wall , '' produced by the deceleration of the magnetized collapsing envelope against the bubble ; the deceleration leads to a pileup of the field lines .",
    "the decelerated material slides along the compressed field lines nearly vertically towards the equator . before hitting the equator ,",
    "the downward moving material is deflected towards the origin by a strong ( thermal ) pressure gradient to join the pseudodisk beneath the magnetic bubble .",
    "the equatorial part of the collapsing envelope joins onto the pseudodisk more directly .",
    "it slows down near the outer edge of the pseudodisk before being reaccelerated towards the center by gravity .",
    "the deceleration and reacceleration show up more clearly in fig .",
    "[ vrvphi_eq ] , where we plot the radial component of the velocity on the equator as a function of radius .",
    "the curve of radial speed has a peak around @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is close to zero ; indeed , the gas there is actually slowly expanding rather than collapsing .",
    "we identify the region near the stagnation radius @xmath95 as a `` magnetic barrier '' , as opposed to a `` centrifugal barrier . ''",
    "the reason is that , at this location , the rotation speed is well below that needed for the centrifugal force to balance the gravity ( see fig .  [ vrvphi_eq ] , where both speeds are plotted ) .",
    "there is tantalizing evidence for such a structure in the class 0 source iram 04191 , as we discuss in ",
    "[ magnetogyrosphere ] .",
    "it bounds the pseudodisk from outside .",
    "note that the infall speeds at large distances are close to half the sound speed , comparable to that inferred observationally in the dense core l1544 ( as mentioned earlier ) and in the envelope of iram 04191 , except near the outer boundary , where the edge effect becomes significant .",
    "the large - scale infall is induced by the reduction of the full field strength at @xmath50 ( from @xmath43 to 13.3 ) , which weakens the initial magnetic support relative to self - gravity .    after passing through the stagnation region at the magnetic barrier ,",
    "the pseudodisk material on the equator collapses quickly inward .",
    "the rapid infall leads to a spinup of the collapsing material , as shown in fig .",
    "[ vrvphi_eq ] . the inward increase in rotation speed",
    "is slowed down around a dimensionless radius @xmath96 , and levels off near @xmath97 .",
    "a glance at fig .",
    "[ twist ] shows that this is the region where the magnetic bubble is initiated . in this region ,",
    "the radial infall is temporarily slowed down , as a result of increased centrifugal support ; in other words , a centrifugal barrier is encountered .",
    "the slowdown of infall allows more time for the magnetic braking to operate .",
    "interior to @xmath98 is a strongly magnetized region dominated by the central split monopole . here , the rotation speed drops steadily with decreasing radius , as a result of efficient braking by the strong magnetic field .",
    "the loss of centrifugal support causes the equatorial material to resume its rapid collapse towards the center .",
    "the rapid infall and slow rotation leave no doubt that a rotationally supported disk is not produced in this standard model .",
    "in particular , the rotation speed at small radii is well below that needed to provide centrifugal support against gravity ( compare the top two curves in fig .",
    "[ vrvphi_eq ] ) . upon arriving at the inner hole ,",
    "the infall material has lost most of its original angular momentum along the way .",
    "the questions is : how does the stripping of angular momentum occur mechanically ?",
    "the key to answering the above question lies in the magnetic bubble ( region iii ) .",
    "it is powered by the pseudodisk ( region ii ) .",
    "the material in the pseudodisk spins up as it collapses , producing a growing toroidal magnetic field , which in turn leads to a buildup of magnetic pressure .",
    "the over - pressure in the region is relieved by expansion along the path of least resistance .",
    "expansion is restricted to the left of the region or vertically up by the strong monopole field .",
    "it can not freely expand horizontally outward either ; it is contained by the ram pressure of the infalling material .",

    "after a short period of initial adjustment ( of order @xmath100  sec ) , the mass - time curve becomes remarkably straight , although there are low - amplitude oscillations . as we discuss in detail in ",

    "note that the combination @xmath113 on the right hand side of the second equality is simply the speed with which the sphere is expanding relative to the material that moves at a radial speed of @xmath94 .",
    "the dimensionless mass distribution @xmath114 can be evaluated in another way , using equations  ( [ mass_dimensionless ] ) , which states that the mass inside a given radius is simply the sum of all mass ( including the point mass ) up to that radius . in a strictly self - similar solution ,",

    "perfect agreement is not to be expected , given the finite sizes of the inner and outer boundaries of the computation domain .",
    "the good agreement suggests that the collapse solution fluctuates around a well defined self - similar solution , with a mass distribution close to those shown in the figure .",
    "a similar closure relation can be derived for the angular momentum , allowing further verification of the approximate self similarity of this solution .",

    "the contribution to @xmath114 due to the advection term ( proportional to the infall speed @xmath134 ) has a minimum value of @xmath135 near the radius @xmath122 , where the infall is slowed down at the magnetic barrier .",
    "it increases inwards as the temporarily slowed down material picks up infall speed ( see fig .",
    "[ vrvphi_eq ] ) .",
    "the dip is compensated , to a large extent , by a peak in the contribution due to volume expansion ( for a sphere of fixed dimensionless radius @xmath107 ) .",

    "this mass is nearly twice the classical value for the inside - out collapse of a singular isothermal sphere ( sis ) , which has @xmath138 in our mass units @xcite .",
    "part of the increase comes from the fact that the initial configuration for collapse is , on average , denser than the sis .",
    "another reason is that , unlike the sis , the initial configuration is out of exact force balance , which induces a subsonic , global contraction .",
    "the mass accretion onto the point mass is hindered , on the other hand , by rotation , which tends to slow down the collapsing material through centrifugal force .",
    "indeed , in the absence of a magnetic field , most of the collapsed material in the standard model would be rotationally supported rather than falling to the center .",
    "the relatively high rate of _ central _ mass accretion is made possible by continuous magnetic braking .    to understand the effects of magnetic braking on the angular momentum evolution in more detail , we plot in fig .",

    "a crucial difference is that , unlike @xmath114 , @xmath128 does not asymptote to a finite value near the origin .",
    "rather , it approaches zero at small radii .",
    "the implication is that , _ although mass falls onto the central object at a relatively high rate , little angular momentum is accreted_. the angular momentum removal can be seen most clearly by comparing the angular momentum advected into a sphere by mass motion ( second term ) and that removed by magnetic braking from the same surface ( third term ) .",
    "> from fig .",
    "[ l_av ] , we find that these two terms nearly cancel each other over an extended region ( up to @xmath139 )",
    ". the near cancellation points to a detailed balance of inward and outward transport of angular momentum , which enables a large amount of matter to be accreted , but little angular momentum .",
    "the balance is at the heart of the magnetic braking - driven mass accretion .",
    "the magnetic bubble plays a key role in the angular momentum redistribution .",
    "angular momentum is transported outward in this region through both outflowing gas and magnetic torque . in the standard model ,",
    "roughly half of the angular momentum advected across a given radius by the equatorial , infalling , pseudodisk is carried away by the outflowing material ; the other half by the highly twisted magnetic field .",
    "it is the toroidal field that drives the expansion of the bubble , as in the so - called `` magnetic tower '' investigated by @xcite .",
    "the strength of the toroidal field is determined by the ambient pressure that confines the bubble in the lateral direction . in fig .",
    "[ pressures ] , we plot the total pressure and its various components as a function of angle at a representative radius @xmath140 ( roughly the middle radius of the bubble ) .",
    "the total pressure does not vary much at different angles , but it is dominated by different components in different regions . in the pseudodisk near the equator ( @xmath75 ) , it is dominated by the thermal pressure , because of high density .",
    "the pressure due to the toroidal magnetic field dominates at intermediate latitudes inside the bubble .",
    "it is more than an order of magnitude stronger than the pressure due to the poloidal field , and a factor of @xmath141 times larger than the thermal pressure .",
    "the bubble is therefore magnetically dominated , with a plasma-@xmath142 less than unity .",
    "the polar region is even more strongly dominated by the magnetic field , although by the poloidal rather than the toroidal component .",
    "the kinematics of the three regions are also quite distinct . over most of the equatorial pseudodisk , the infall and rotation speeds are comparable",
    ". both are supersonic and super alfvnic .",
    "the infall dominates the rotation in the polar funnel .",
    "it is supersonic but sub - alfvnic ( because of a high alfvn speed associated with the strong poloidal field and low density ) .",
    "the bubble , on the other hand , is a toroidally dominated structure in both magnetic field ( by definition ) and velocity field .",
    "the mass - weighted average rotation speed inside the bulk of the bubble ( within a dimensionless radius @xmath143 ) is about @xmath144 , whereas that for the average poloidal speed is slightly less than the sound speed @xmath20 , which is smaller than the alfvn speed .",
    "the meridian flow inside the bubble is thus generally sub - alfvnic .",
    "it is in contact , through magnetosonic waves , with the base of the bubble , where a toroidal magnetic flux is constantly generated out of the poloidal flux ( dragged in from large distances ) by differential rotation .",
    "it is the continuous insertion of new toroidal flux into the bubble that drives it to expand @xcite .",
    "the sub - alfvnic motions indicate that the bubble can be viewed as being more or less quasi - static in the meridian plane .",
    "it is then natural to ask : what supports the bubble against the gravity ( which comes mostly from the point mass at the radii of the bubble , with some contribution from the self - gravity ) ?",
    "it turns out that the support is provided mainly by the rotation and toroidal magnetic field ; the latter acts on the bubble material through a combination of magnetic pressure gradient and tension force . in some sense ,",
    "the slowly expanding bubble is a partly rotationally and partly magnetically supported structure that forms in place of the purely rotationally supported structure that would form in the absence of magnetic braking .",
    "it is a generic , potentially observable structure that we will discuss in some depth in ",
    "[ magnetogyrosphere ] .",
    "the bubble is a depository of mass and angular momentum .",
    "the dimensionless mass and angular momentum are more or less constant in time , with small fluctuations due to reconnection events .",
    "the bubble has an average mass @xmath145 within a radius of @xmath143 , which is about 64% of the central point mass ( @xmath146 ) .",
    "it carries a total dimensionless angular momentum of @xmath147 .",
    "the average specific angular momentum is therefore @xmath148 .",
    "it corresponds to a centrifugal radius of @xmath149 if a fraction of the rotating bubble material were to recollapse at a time @xmath103 in the absence of further magnetic braking , it would form a disk of size comparable to the centrifugal radius @xmath150 around the central object .",
    "we will discuss the possibility of late - time disk formation in   [ magnetogyrosphere ] .",
    "another way to gauge the dynamic state of the bubble is to consider its energies .",
    "the total ( thermal , kinetic and magnetic ) energy is close to the gravitational binding energy in the potential of the central point mass .",
    "it is well below the gravitational binding energy when the self - gravity of the core is also taken into account .",
    "the bulk of the bubble material can not escape to infinity by itself .",
    "it is expanding slowly outward only because it is being pushed continuously from below , as more and more mass and toroidal magnetic flux being inserted into the bubble .",
    "if for some reason the insertion were to stop suddenly , the bubble ( at least a portion of it ) may recollapse to form a disk .",
    "the existence of a large amount of bound ( bubble ) material of high specific angular momentum not far from the center indicates that , _ although magnetic braking can allow mass to fall into the center at a high rate , the overall angular momentum problem is not decisively resolved .",
    "_ we will speculate in the discussion section implications of this situation , including the possible role of protostellar winds in dispersing away the bubble and the angular momentum accumulated in it .",
    "having examined in some detail a standard model with a specific mass - to - flux ratio of @xmath81 , we now turn our attention to cases with different degrees of magnetization .",
    "we will first concentrate on the relative weak field cases with @xmath2 between 400 and 13.3 (   [ weakfield ] ) .",
    "the strong field cases with @xmath43 and @xmath151 behave quite differently ; they will be discussed separately in   [ strongfield ] .",
    "before going into details of the various collapse solutions , we first discuss their general behaviors based on the dimensionless central mass @xmath108 .",
    "it is defined as @xmath152 , where @xmath99 is the central mass .",
    "the dimensionless mass @xmath153 at any given time is simply the averaged mass accretion rate up to that time , normalized by @xmath154 .",
    "it is plotted as a function of time in fig .",
    "[ mstar_lowb ] for all cases with @xmath2 between 13.3 and 400 .",
    "since mass accretion is driven by magnetic braking , which in turn depends on the field strength , one expects @xmath108 to decrease as @xmath2 increases . this trend",
    "is indeed seen in fig .",
    "[ mstar_lowb ] , except for the three most weakly magnetized cases ( @xmath13 , 200 and 133 ) . for these extremely weak field cases , the trend is not as clear , especially at late times .",
    "it turns out that these are the cases where a rotationally - supported , equilibrium disk is present .",
    "they are discussed in   [ weakextreme ] .",
    "even the weakest field case has a significant mass accretion , however , at a rate well above that in the non - magnetic case ( @xmath155 ; the lowest curve in the figure ) at late times .",
    "the initial burst of mass accretion in the non - magnetic case comes from the finite size of the inner hole and the presence of a small `` seed '' mass that was placed at the center to induce collapse , rather than any angular momentum redistribution .",
    "the initial burst in mass accretion is also present in the magnetized cases , although it is relatively inconspicuous in the two strongest field cases ( @xmath81 and @xmath156 ) . in both cases ,",
    "the ( average ) mass accretion rate quickly approaches a plateau , indicating that a nearly self - similar state is reached ; the small oscillations are related to magnetic flux accumulation in the central hole ( see   [ strongfield ] below ) .",
    "indeed , the collapse solution in the @xmath157 case is very similar to that of the standard @xmath81 case discussed in the last section .",
    "it will not be discussed separately further .",
    "the intermediate cases with @xmath158 and 80 are particularly interesting .",
    "they represent the transition from the weaker field cases where a rotationally - supported , equilibrium disk is present to those where the disk formation is suppressed .",
    "these cases are discussed in   [ transition ] .",
    "the rotating collapse is modified significantly by the magnetic field in the case of @xmath13 , which corresponds to a field strength of merely @xmath159 at the typical core radius of 0.05  pc . in the absence of any magnetic field , the initial configuration collapses into a self - gravitating ring ( centered at a dimensionless radius @xmath160 ) .",
    "the ring formation is suppressed by the weak field , and a disk is produced in its place , as shown in fig .",
    "[ snap_bpt01 ] .",
    "the figure is a snapshot at a representative time @xmath161  sec , plotted in self - similar quantities .",
    "the snapshots at other times are similar to the one shown .",
    "prominent in the figure is a flatten high - density disk , surrounded by a lower density , more puffed up `` corona . ''",
    "despite the weakness of the initial field , the magnetic pressure due to toroidal field actually dominates the thermal pressure , by a factor of @xmath141 on average .",
    "the inner part of the disk is more strongly magnetized , with the ratio of magnetic to thermal pressures greater than 10 inside a radius of @xmath162 , perhaps as a result of a shorter orbital period , which allows the field lines to wind up more turns in a given time .",
    "the poloidal magnetic field inside the disk is , on the other hand , very weak , with an energy of order @xmath163 of the thermal energy on average .",
    "the weak poloidal field is susceptible to magnetorotational instability ( mri ; * ? ? ?",
    "the role of mri , as opposed to simple twisting of a pre - existing poloidal field , in redistributing angular momentum in the disk remains to be quantified ( see discussion in   [ lowbetadisk ] below ) .",
    "the disk is rotationally supported .",
    "the best evidence for rotational support comes from fig .",
    "[ disk_speeds ] , where the rotation speed of the material on the equator is compared to the equilibrium rotation speed computed from the ( total ) gravitational potential at the representative time shown in fig .",
    "[ snap_bpt01 ] . inside the disk ( within a radius of about @xmath164 ) , the actual rotation speed is close to , but slightly less than , the equilibrium value .",
    "the small deviation is caused by additional supports from thermal pressure and magnetic forces . outside the disk ,",
    "the rotation speed is substantially less than the equilibrium value .",
    "also plotted in fig .",
    "[ disk_speeds ] is the radial component of the velocity of the material on the equator .",
    "it shows an outer region that infalls supersonically , and an inner region that is nearly static .",
    "the former is expected of the collapsing envelope , whereas the latter is consistent with a rotationally - supported disk that is close to an equilibrium in the radial direction .",
    "the disk does have a small , non - zero , radial velocity , which is responsible for transporting material from the outer disk to the inner disk .",
    "the transport , driven by angular momentum redistribution , enables mass accretion onto the central object , at a dimensionless rate @xmath165 , which is about 1/3 of the rate for sis @xcite .",
    "the rate of mass accretion from the disk to the central object is small compared to that from the envelope to the disk . as a result ,",
    "the bulk of the material collapsed from the envelope is stored in the disk rather than the central object .",
    "the relative smallness of the central mass is also evident from the equilibrium rotation curve shown in fig .",
    "[ disk_speeds ] , which deviates significantly from a keplerian curve , especially in the outer part of the disk . the deviation ,",
    "particularly the bump near the disk edge around @xmath166 , is an indication that self - gravity is important ; indeed , it dominates the gravity of the central mass beyond a dimensionless radius @xmath167 .",
    "the @xmath168 and 133 cases are qualitatively similar to the @xmath13 case .",
    "they all produce a persistent , rotationally supported disk .",
    "there are some quantitative differences , however .",
    "the magnetic barrier , barely noticeable in the weakest field case , are rather prominent in the stronger field cases . also , as the field strength increases , the disk becomes more dynamically active in the radial direction .",
    "the infall speed can occasionally become supersonic in some ( usually narrow ) regions , indicating that sporadic disk disruption has begun already in localized places , especially in the @xmath169 case .",
    "the disruption becomes more widespread and persistent as the field strength increases further .",
    "sustained disk disruption happens in the case of @xmath170 . the disruption is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ vr_specmom_bpt05 ] , where the radial component of the velocity , @xmath94 , on the equator is plotted at a representative time @xmath171  sec . unlike the weaker magnetic field case of @xmath13 shown in fig .",
    "[ disk_speeds ] , where the radial velocity nearly vanishes everywhere in the disk , @xmath94 is close to zero in four discrete ( narrow ) regions , with rapid , transonic or even supersonic , infall in between .",
    "the stagnation point at the largest radius is the magnetic barrier , as in the standard , stronger field case ( see fig .  [ vrvphi_eq ] ) . in the standard case",
    ", there is a second stagnation point interior to the magnetic barrier , which we have interpreted as the centrifugal barrier , where the infall is slowed down temporarily and the magnetic braking is locally enhanced . in the @xmath170 case ,",
    "the stagnation points interior to the magnetic barrier are also centrifugal barriers .",
    "the reason for the existence of more than one barriers can be seen from the upper curve in fig .",
    "[ vr_specmom_bpt05 ] , where the specific angular momentum is plotted as a function of radius .",
    "even though a good fraction ( about half ) of the angular momentum is removed at the first centrifugal barrier , there is still a significant amount left interior to it .",
    "the material recollapses quickly towards the center , spinning up at the same time , until a second centrifugal barrier is encountered .",
    "the slowdown allows more time for the fluid rotation to twist up the field lines .",
    "the magnetic braking removes enough angular momentum from the material in the equatorial region to enable it to recollapse for a third time , all the way to near the inner boundary , where the infall is rearrested by rotation . in some sense",
    ", the rotating material tries to settle into a rotationally supported disk , but the attempt is repeatedly frustrated by magnetic braking .",
    "the result is a collection of discrete rings that are temporarily supported by the centrifugal force , separated by regions of rapid collapse , where the rotational support is insufficient to balance the gravity .",
    "note that in 3d , the rings may break up into arcs or clumps , some of which may become self - gravitating and form ( sub-)stellar objects .    the material in the stagnation region near a centrifugal barrier loses a large fraction of its angular momentum , and collapses quickly inwards after exiting the region .",
    "why is it possible to remove a large fraction of the angular momentum before the material begins collapsing dynamically ?",
    "one may expect the gas to move ( inward ) out of the stagnation region as soon as its specific angular momentum is reduced slightly below the local equilibrium value , because of an imbalance of gravity and centrifugal force .",
    "if this were true , the amount of angular momentum reduction achievable in the region will be quite limited .",
    "however , it takes a finite amount of time for even the full gravity to reaccelerate the material to ( say ) the sound speed from at rest , no matter how small a value its angular momentum has been reduced to ; in many cases , the gravity must first reverse the ( slowly ) expanding motion often found near the centrifugal barrier , which takes additional time .",
    "if the magnetic torque is strong enough , it can remove a large fraction , if not all , of the angular momentum of the gas within that time .",
    "in other words , it is the inertia of the stalled gas that enables the magnetic braking to reduce the specific angular momentum significantly below the local equilibrium value .",
    "the efficient , localized , braking is responsible for the unique , `` hopping , '' pattern of alternating stagnation and rapid infall seen in fig .",
    "[ vr_specmom_bpt05 ] .",
    "the rotationally supported rings show up clearly in the density map ( fig .",
    "[ disk_unitvec_bpt05 ] ) .",
    "they are overdense regions near the equator created by stalled infall , which leads to a pileup of matter .",
    "the slowdown also allows more time for magnetic braking to operate .",
    "the clearest evidence for enhanced braking comes from the outer most ring near the dimensionless radius @xmath166 : there is an outflow driven from that location at an acute angle with respect to the equatorial plane , as in the magnetic bubble of the standard case .",
    "evidence for braking - driven outflows from the inner two rings is less clean - cut ; they may be masked by the chaotic meridianal flow pattern in the puffed - up region outside the equatorial rings .",
    "the chaotic motions are generally subsonic .",
    "they are dominated in 3d by supersonic rotation .",
    "indeed , the puffed - up structure is equivalent to the magnetic bubble in the standard model : both are supported by a combination of ( mostly toroidal ) magnetic fields and rotation . in some sense ,",
    "the puffed - up structure is a collection of ( relatively weak ) bubbles , driven from multiple centrifugal barriers whose locations vary in time .",
    "such a structure is also present in the somewhat stronger field case of @xmath158 .",
    "we believe it is a generic feature of the magnetized rotating collapse when the field is strong enough to disrupt the rotationally supported disk but too weak to channel the outflowing material into a single , coherent bubble .",
    "this feature is discussed further in   [ magnetogyrosphere ] .",
    "we note that the number of discrete centrifugal barriers depends on the field strength .",
    "as the field strength decreases , more and more centrifugal barriers appear , until they start to overlap and merge into a single , more or less contiguous structure  a rotationally supported disk ( see the @xmath13 case discussed above ) .",
    "conversely , the disk is replaced by fewer and fewer centrifugal barriers as the field strength increases . for the standard , @xmath81 case ,",
    "the number of identifiable centrifugal barriers is one at most times .",
    "this number can drop to zero for more strongly magnetized cases , to which we turn our attention next .",
    "we first focus on the time evolution of the central point mass ( fig .",
    "[ mstar_highb_noscaled ] ) , which provides an overall measure of the collapse solutions .",
    "the point mass at a give time remains similar or even becomes smaller as the field strength increases , unlike the moderately weak field ( @xmath170 to 13.3 ) cases .",
    "the trend is especially clear for the strongest field case of the whole set ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "this change in the dependence of point mass on the field strength indicates a change in the solution behavior . in the weak field cases ,",
    "the mass accretion is limited by angular momentum removal , whose rate generally increases with the field strength .",
    "angular momentum removal is no longer the limiting factor in the strong field cases : the ( poloidal ) fields at small radii are apparently strong enough , especially after amplification from collapse , that a relatively small twist can remove most of the angular momentum of the collapsing material and redistribute it to large distances .",
    "the limiting factor shifts instead to the magnetic tension , which replaces the rotation as the main impediment to mass accretion .",
    "the tension is stronger ( relative to gravity ) for a smaller mass - to - flux ratio @xmath2 . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath172 ( i.e. , a magnetically subcritical core ) , the tension force would prevent core collapse and mass accretion altogether .    unlike angular momentum , the magnetic flux can not be removed in the ideal mhd limit that we are working in .",
    "it accumulates near the central object  in the central hole in our simulation .",
    "the flux accumulation and its sudden release through reconnection allow the magnetic tension to suppress mass accretion onto the central object over an extended period of time even in a magnetically supercritical core with an @xmath2 significantly larger than unity .",
    "they are responsible for the step - like variations of the point mass shown in fig .",
    "[ mstar_highb_noscaled ] . before discussing magnetic reconnection in",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ snap_b1pt0 ] a snapshot of the @xmath43 case at a representative time before reconnection .",
    "although one can still divide the collapse solution into four regions as in the standard case ( collapsing envelope , equatorial pseudodisk , magnetic bubble and polar funnel , see fig .  [ snap ] ) , these regions are less distinct .",
    "in particular , the magnetic bubble ( defined as the region where the toroidal field is stronger than the poloidal field ) is much less prominent than in the standard @xmath81 case .",
    "it is located at a larger distance from the center and contains a much lower mass and angular momentum . within a radius of @xmath173 ,",
    "the dimensionless mass of the bubble is only 0.18 and angular momentum is 0.28 .",
    "these are to be compared with the bubble mass of @xmath174 and angular momentum of @xmath147 estimated earlier for the standard case .",
    "indeed , the bubble can be more profitably viewed as part of a broader magnetic braking - driven wind , where the field lines are twisted to varying degrees .",
    "the ( poloidal ) field is strong enough that even a relatively small twist can exert an appreciable torque on the gas : for a fixed twist angle , the magnetic torque is proportional to the field strength squared . compared to the standard case , the twisted field lines unwind faster because of a higher alfvn speed .",
    "another difference is the absence of a prominent magnetic wall in which the field lines are severely compressed ; the stronger fields are more difficult to compress . as a result ,",
    "the collapsing envelope merges more smoothly into the equatorial pseudodisk , which is now much thicker .",
    "the centrifugal force inside the pseudodisk remains substantially below the gravity in general . in some sense ,",
    "parcels of infalling material are chasing their centrifugal barriers but unable to reach them because of efficient magnetic braking , which continuously moves the barriers inward .",
    "we conclude that the formation of a rotationally supported disk is completely suppressed in the relatively strong field regime , in agreement with the earlier work of als03 .",
    "a feature not apparent in the early work is episodic mass accretion . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ mstar_highb_noscaled ] , most of the central mass in the @xmath43 case is accreted in discrete bursts , which are caused by magnetic reconnection . to determine how the bursts are triggered , we focus on the large burst around @xmath175  sec .",

    "[ burst ] .",
    "note the nearly radial field lines that thread the surface of the inner hole .",
    "together with their mirror images ( of opposite polarity ) in the lower quadrant ( not shown ) , they form a split magnetic monopole .",
    "the monopole compresses the material in the equatorial region into a thin , dense ( pseudo)disk , which collapse supersonically . as more and more disk material falls into the point mass , more and more field lines",
    "are added to the central hole .",
    "the growing monopole pushes on the disk material harder and harder from above and below . when field lines of opposite polarities are pressed into a single cell on the equator , they reconnect quickly due to numerical diffusion .",
    "we observe a maximum in the magnetic flux that threads the inner hole shortly before the onset of violent reconnection .",
    "there is a brief period of time when matter falls into the central hole but not the field lines .",
    "the separation indicates that significant magnetic diffusion is present before the violent reconnection .",
    "the reconnected field lines pull the disk material outward ( see the right panel of fig",
    ".  [ burst ] ) , leaving behind an evacuated region that is unable to keep the oppositely directing , monopolar field lines apart . as a result , the field lines threading the central hole rush onto the disk , adding to the reconnected field lines that accelerate the equatorial material outward . except for a tiny amount of mass falling into the central hole in the polar region , mass accretion",
    "is essentially terminated .    as the dense blob ( or ring in 3d ) shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ burst ] moves outwards , it gradually slows down for several reasons .",
    "first , it ploughs into infalling material , which cancels some of its outward momentum .",
    "second , as the mass of the blob increases , through both sweeping up material along its path and accretion from above and below along field lines , the gravitational pull of the central point mass increases as well .",
    "in addition , the magnetic tension that pushes the blob outwards from behind weakens with time , as the bent field lines straighten up .",
    "sooner or later , there will be enough material accumulated for the gravity to overwhelm the magnetic forces and pull the matter toward the center again .",
    "the recollapsing flow in the equatorial region typically moves at a speed well below the local free fall speed , because it has to drag along with it a rather strong magnetic field , which resists the gravitational pull through tension force .",
    "once the bulk of the recollapsing material reaches the inner hole , it produces a burst in mass accretion . at the same time , the accreted material deposits its magnetic flux on the surface of the inner hole , creating a growing split magnetic monopole that , in time , would shut off the mass accretion through reconnection , and eject the remaining material to larger distances , starting another cycle of mass accumulation , collapse , and ejection . in some sense",
    ", the split monopole acts as an ever tightening `` magnetic gate : '' as magnetic flux accumulates , mass accretion becomes more and more difficult , until shut off almost completely by reconnection ; the reconnection allows a large amount of magnetic flux ( associated with the central point mass ) to act on a small amount of ( disk ) matter .    in summary ,",
    "we have computed the collapse of rotating , strongly magnetized cores with much higher angular resolution at small radii than the previous calculations that employ a cylindrical coordinate system .",
    "we confirmed the conclusion of als03 that the magnetic braking in such cores is too strong for the rotationally supported disks to form in the ideal mhd limit .",
    "we went one step further , showing that the disk suppression holds true even in the presence of ( numerically triggered ) reconnection .",
    "the main effect of the reconnection events is to generate episodic mass accretion .",
    "the initial rotation speed @xmath38 ( in units of sound speed ) adopted in the standard simulation is on the high side of the observationally inferred range . here",
    "we discuss three variants of the standard model , with @xmath176 , @xmath177 and @xmath178 , respectively . without rotation , the collapsing envelope",

    "this episodic behavior is therefore independent of rotation , in accordance with the interpretation based on reconnection that we advanced in the last section .",
    "the value of the dimensionless point mass , @xmath179 , corresponds to a mass accretion rate that is about 4 times higher than the rate for the collapse of a static sis ( 1.95 ; * ? ? ?",

    "[ multi_diffrot ] a representative snapshot for each of the cases with @xmath176 , @xmath177 , @xmath178 and @xmath33 . in the absence of rotation ,",
    "three of the four dynamically distinct regions that we have identified in the standard ( rotating ) model are clearly present : the polar funnel flow ( region iv ) , equatorial pseudodisk ( region ii ) , and collapsing envelope ( region i ) .",
    "they are separated by a magnetic wall , which divides the outer collapsing envelope from the inner two regions , both of which are dominated by the central split magnetic monopole .",
    "this magnetic structure is remarkably similar to the one sketched in fig .  1 of @xcite .",
    "rotation changes the appearance of the collapse solution by inflating a bubble in between the polar funnel and the pseudodisk .",
    "it is bounded from outside by the envelope .",
    "as one may expect intuitively , the size ( mostly the width ) of the bubble increases with the initial rotation speed ; for the same initial magnetic field , a faster rotation should wind up the field lines more , generating a larger magnetic bubble , as shown in the figure .",
    "the difference in the rotation speed does not appear to change the dynamics of the core collapse and magnetic braking fundamentally , however .",
    "our most important result is that the rotationally supported disk can be disrupted by a weak magnetic field corresponding to a mass - to - flux ratio @xmath181 .",
    "this result may seem surprising at the first sight , in view of the general expectation that the field is dynamically important only when @xmath182 . to illuminate the reason behind this seemingly unexpected result",
    ", we provide an order - of - magnitude estimate of the characteristic mass - to - flux ratio for significant magnetic braking from the following equation : @xmath183 where @xmath184 , @xmath185 and @xmath186 are the mass , specific angular momentum and radius of the disk in the absence of magnetic braking at time @xmath103 , and @xmath60 and @xmath187 are the toroidal and vertical components of the magnetic field on the disk surface . the equation is simply a condition on the rate of magnetic braking that would be required to remove all of the disk angular momentum within the time @xmath103 .",
    "the disk mass @xmath184 is related to the magnetic flux threading the disk , @xmath188 , through the dimensional mass - to - flux ratio @xmath189 , which is conserved along any field line during the core collapse in the ideal mhd limit . eliminating @xmath187 in terms of @xmath184 and @xmath2 from equation ( [ leqtaut ] )",
    ", we have @xmath190 to simplify the right hand side of the equation further , we assume that the disk is self - gravitating and rotationally supported ( as in the @xmath13 case shown in fig .",
    "[ [ snap_bpt01 ] ] ) , with a rotation speed @xmath191 and specific angular momentum @xmath192 .",
    "the above equation then becomes @xmath193 where @xmath194 is the disk rotation period .",
    "clearly , the characteristic mass - to - flux ratio can greatly exceed unity for two reasons : ( 1 ) tight wrapping of the disk magnetic field , @xmath195 , which increases the rate of angular momentum removal through magnetic braking ( @xmath196 ) , and ( 2 ) long braking time compared to the disk rotation period , @xmath197 .",
    "the braking time @xmath103 can be identified with the time for core collapse .",
    "the two factors are not entirely independent of each other . since the toroidal magnetic field is created out of the poloidal field by rotation , the field line is expected to become increasingly more twisted with time .",
    "indeed , it may not be unreasonable to approximate the magnetic twist by the number of turns that the disk has rotated around the center within time @xmath103 , so that @xmath198 in this case , the characteristic mass - to - flux ratio reduces to @xmath199    to obtain concrete numbers , let us consider a disk formed at time @xmath103 out of a singular isothermal toroid with an ( angle - averaged ) initial mass distribution @xmath200 and spatially constant rotation speed @xmath201 .",
    "suppose , as in the case of sis @xcite , half of the mass within a radius @xmath202 falls into the collapsed object , the disk , at any given time @xmath103 .",
    "in this case , the disk mass @xmath203 and specific angular momentum @xmath204 , yielding a disk radius @xmath205 and rotation period @xmath206 substituting equation  ( [ period ] ) into equation  ( [ lambda3 ] ) , we finally have @xmath207    for the initial mass distribution with @xmath39 and rotation speed @xmath208 adopted in   [ fieldstrength ] , we obtain a characteristic mass - to - flux ratio for significant magnetic braking of @xmath209 .",
    "this number is remarkably close to our numerically determined value for the disk disruption to begin , which is around 100 .",
    "given the crudeness of the estimate , the agreement is encouraging .",
    "the analytic estimate brings out the key ingredient for efficient disk braking by even weak magnetic fields : short disk rotation period compared to the core collapse time .",
    "in addition , it indicates that the disk in a more slowly rotating core can be disrupted by a weaker magnetic field , which makes physical sense .    besides the rotation rate , another factor that may also affect",
    "the value of the mass - to - flux @xmath2 for significant magnetic braking is ( non - axisymmetric ) gravitational torque .",
    "the torque can speed up mass accretion through a self - gravitating disk , shortening the time available for field line wrapping and magnetic braking .",
    "this additional means of angular momentum redistribution is expected to decrease the efficiency of magnetic braking somewhat . to fully quantify this effect ,",
    "high resolution 3d simulations are required .",
    "our 2d ( axisymmetric ) calculations , while idealized in several ways ( see   [ future ] below ) , allow us to concentrate on the role of magnetic braking in disk dynamics without extra complications from gravitational torques and fragmentation .",
    "we believe the basic conclusion that even weak magnetic fields with @xmath181 are dynamically important in disk formation and evolution is robust .",
    "surrounding the strongly braked disk is a vertically extended structure where the bulk of the angular momentum of the material collapsed from the envelope is parked .",
    "the structure is supported by a combination of ( toroidal ) magnetic field and rotation .",
    "we term it `` magnetogyrosphere , '' to distinguish it from the purely magnetically dominated `` magnetosphere '' or the rotationally supported disk .",
    "an example of the magnetogyrosphere is shown in fig .",
    "[ disk_unitvec_bpt05 ] , where @xmath170 . in this particular case ,",

    "the braking of the equatorial material , particularly at the multiple centrifugal barriers , is what powers the rather chaotic motions inside the slowly expanding magnetogyrosphere .",
    "the dimensionless size of the magnetogyrosphere is @xmath210 , corresponding to a physical size of @xmath211  au at a time of @xmath212  sec , for a sound speed of @xmath27  km / s . by this time",

    "most of the material collapsed from the envelope is therefore stored in the magnetogyrosphere , rather than going into the central object .",
    "it is prevented from falling into the center by the combined effect of magnetic field and rotation . to be quantitative ,",
    "the mass weighted flow speed in the poloidal plane is only @xmath217  km / s inside the magnetogyrosphere , which is less than half of the sound speed @xmath27  km / s .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the size of the magnetogyrosphere is increasing slowly , at a rate of roughly a quarter of the sound speed . for comparison , the free fall speed @xmath218^{1/2}$ ] at the outer edge of the magnetogyrosphere at @xmath216  au is @xmath219  km / s , an order of magnitude higher than the average poloidal speed .",
    "the bulk of the magnetogyrospheric material is levitated against the gravity by a combination of ( mostly magnetic ) pressure gradient and centrifugal force from rotation ; the mass averaged rotation speed is @xmath220  km / s , not far from the free fall speed .",
    "qualitatively similar behaviors are found in other moderately weakly magnetized models of @xmath158 , 20 , and 13.3 .",
    "for example , in the standard model with @xmath81 , the magnetic braking is strong enough that only a single centrifugal barrier exists . after exiting the barrier",
    ", the equatorial material falls straight to the center whereas the extracted angular momentum is stored in a slowly expanding bubble  the magnetogyrosphere , an extended structure again dominated by a combination of magnetic field and rotation ( see   [ ss ] ) .",
    "compared with the @xmath221 case , the magnetogyrosphere contains less material ( with a mass somewhat less than , rather than well exceeding , the central mass ) , which moves faster on average and in a more ordered fashion in the poloidal plane .    to illustrate what the magnetogyrosphere may look like observationally , we show in fig .",
    "[ columndensity ] the column density distributions of the @xmath170 and @xmath222 viewed perpendicular to the axis . in both cases , there is a highly - flattened , dense equatorial region , sandwiched by a more puffed - up structure .",

    "the latter is the slowly expanding magnetogyrosphere .",
    "it is held up mostly by the ( toroidal ) magnetic field in the vertical direction and laterally by rotation .",
    "magnetogyrospheres should exist in some form .",
    "fundamentally , this is because a rotating , collapsing core will necessarily develop a differential rotation , which inevitably interacts strongly with a poloidal magnetic field , as long as the matter and field are well coupled .",
    "the interaction is especially strong near the centrifugal barrier , where the slowdown of infall motion allows more time for the differential rotation to wrap up the field lines .",
    "when the field is strong enough to remove angular momentum from the collapsing material , but too weak to transport most of the removed angular momentum out of the system , a magnetogyrosphere develops . in principle",
    ", the magnetogyrosphere can be distinguished easily from the collapsing ( inner ) envelope , since both the velocity and magnetic field are dominated by the toroidal component in the former and by the poloidal component in the latter .",
    "they also have different volume and column densities , which may also help separating the two . in practice , the mass distribution and especially the kinematics of both the magnetogyrosphere and the inner envelope are expected to be modified by the powerful protostellar winds , which sweep the ambient medium into bipolar molecular outflows . to search for observational evidence for the magnetogyrosphere ,",

    "one of the best studied class 0 sources is iram 04191 .",

    "this region could be part of the magnetogyrosphere .",
    "alternatively , it could be material accelerated outwards by the fast protostellar wind @xcite .",

    "a natural possibility for the structure is the magnetogyrosphere , which can provide confinement through both thermal pressure and magnetic `` hoop '' stresses associated with the toroidal field .",
    "indeed , a glance at the density distribution in fig .",

    "a unique model prediction is the existence of more than one centrifugal barriers interior to the magnetic barrier , depending on the field strength and assuming good coupling between the field and matter .",
    "detection of such a feature would clinch the case for disk disruption by ( repeated ) magnetic braking .",
    "if the bulk of the angular momentum of the collapsed material is indeed deposited in the magnetogyrosphere , what eventually happens to the magnetogyrosphere becomes an important issue in the angular momentum evolution of the system .",
    "we believe the fate of the magnetogyrosphere is tied to that of the dense core material , the majority of which is not incorporated into stars .",
    "for example , in the taurus molecular clouds , the dense hco@xmath237 cores typically contain a few to several solar masses @xcite , whereas the typical mass of the ysos is only @xmath135  m@xmath214 @xcite .",
    "it is likely that the bulk of the core material is removed by the powerful protostellar wind .",
    "since the specific angular momentum of the core material tends to increase with distance , it follows that the protostellar wind blows away the majority of not only the mass , but also the angular momentum , of the system , independent of magnetic braking and magnetogyrosphere formation .",
    "the formation of a magnetogyrosphere in place of a rotationally supported disk can make the wind - stripping of angular momentum potentially more efficient ; it should be easier to blow away the more spherical , lower density , magnetogyrosphere than a disk .",
    "the dispersal of the magnetogyrospheric material allows the wind to remove the angular momentum associated with not only the portion of the core material that does not collapse into the central object but also the collapsed portion ; the latter is parked mostly in the magnetogyrosphere .",
    "wind - stripping is a powerful mechanism of angular momentum removal that deserves close attention .",
    "the total angular momentum retained in a stellar system may be determined to a large extent by the amount of the high specific angular momentum magnetospheric and/or core material that survives the wind - stripping .",
    "the left - over material may recollapse towards the center , perhaps forming a rotationally supported disk , which could persist once the massive , slowly rotating envelope that strongly brakes the disk rotation at earlier times has been cleared away .",
    "it takes only a small fraction of the mass and angular momentum of a typical dense core to form a minimum solar nebula .",
    "removal of the braking material  the slowly rotating envelope  is one way for the all - important , rotationally supported disk to appear in the collapse of a magnetized core .",
    "another possibility , to be discussed briefly in ",
    "[ future ] below , is through nonideal mhd effects , such as ambipolar diffusion .",
    "we find persistent , rotationally - supported , equilibrium disks only in the three weakest field cases , with @xmath13 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 .",
    "these mass - to - flux ratios correspond to initial values of equatorial plasma-@xmath142 of @xmath240 , @xmath241 and @xmath242 , respectively .",
    "one may not expect such weak fields to have any significant effect on the dynamics .",
    "however , they are strongly amplified , through both infalling motion and differential rotation .",
    "the amplification is so efficient that , even in the weakest field case of @xmath13 , the magnetic pressure dominates the thermal pressure everywhere in the disk ( except near the equatorial plane , where the toroidal field is forced to zero by symmetry ) , especially in the inner part , where the orbital period is shorter .",

[ beta ] the predicted plasma @xmath142 distribution based on @xmath247 , where @xmath245 is the equilibrium rotation speed shown in fig .  [ disk_speeds ] .",
    "the rough agreement between the predicted and actual distributions lends some support to the conjecture , even though the toroidal field in our simulation is generated mostly by simple twisting of a pre - existing poloidal field , rather than mri .",
    "the condition for a rotationally supported disk _ not _ to be affected significantly by magnetic braking in the ideal mhd limit , @xmath248 , may be difficult to satisfy in the galaxy at the present time .",
    "for a typical low - mass core , the field strength must be less than @xmath249 g on the 0.05pc scale .",
    "the required strength is well below the median value inferred by @xcite for the cold neutral structures of hi gas .",
    "a potential exception is the massive cores of molecular clouds , where column densities as high as 1  g  @xmath250 are often inferred @xcite .",
    "if their field strength is about @xmath251  @xmath10 g or less , the mass - to - flux ratio @xmath2 would be of order 100 or more .",
    "such a weak field ( relative to mass ) should not significantly disrupt disk formation , particularly around massive stars that may form in such cores @xcite , although it can still be amplified to the extent that its pressure dominates the thermal pressure inside the disk , at least in 2d .",
    "if the cores are more strongly magnetized , as is the case for the nearest region of ongoing massive star formation omc1 @xcite , the field may suppress the formation of a rotationally supported disk altogether , as long as it remains well coupled to the matter . in this case",
    ", most of the mass would be accreted through a still rotating but rapidly infalling pseudodisk that is strongly braked by magnetic fields . quantifying this possibility for",
    "massive star formation fully would require 3d simulations that include both radiative transfer ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and magnetic fields , as well as a treatment of ionization and magnetic coupling .",
    "we have performed calculations of disk formation in rotating dense cores magnetized to different degrees under a number of simplifying assumptions .",
    "these include axisymmetry , ideal mhd , and ignoring protostellar winds . the calculations provide a starting point for future refinements .",
    "the most straightforward refinement is to increase spatial resolution .",
    "higher resolution 2d ( axisymmetric ) simulations are desirable in the weakest field cases , where rotationally - supported , equilibrium disks are formed .",
    "such disks can evolve through the twisting of a pre - existing , poloidal field dragged into the disk from large distances by collapsing material .",
    "the disk evolution can be aided , perhaps even dominated , by mri . to adequately quantify the role of mri in driving disk evolution , one need to resolve the fastest growing mri mode @xcite , whose wavelength decreases as the field weakens .",
    "another straightforward refinement is to relax the mirror symmetry imposed at the equator .",
    "we have explored a few cases without the equatorial symmetry , and found qualitatively similar results .",
    "they will be discussed in the future along with 3d simulations .",
    "high resolution , global 3d simulations that include both the core and the disk will be a natural , but challenging , extension of our weak field calculations . they are needed for determining the importance of gravitational torques in redistributing the disk angular momentum relative to hydromagnetic stresses ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , including those arising from possible mri associated with the dominant , toroidal component of the disk magnetic field that can not be treated in 2d .",
    "3d calculations are also needed for treating potential ( sub-)stellar companion formation through fragmentation .",
    "equally challenging will be detailed treatment of nonideal mhd effects .",
    "such effects have been investigated over the years , most systematically by nakano and collaborators ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but have yet to be incorporated into multi - dimensional _ protostellar _ collapse calculations . particularly vulnerable to non - ideal effects",
    "are two prominent features of our relatively strong field cases : the split magnetic monopole near the center and the associated episodic mass accretion .",
    "sharp kinks in field lines ( across the midplane ) , such as those shown in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ burst ] , are expected to be smoothed out by nonideal mhd effects ( see * ? ? ? * for an example ) .",
    "however , there will still be a tendency for the magnetic flux to accumulate at small radii even when realistic nonideal effects are present .",
    "indeed , episodic mass accretion due to repeated flux accumulation and escape can be seen in the nonideal mhd calculations of @xcite under the thin - disk approximation .",
    "whether the deviation from ideal mhd in a collapsing core is strong enough to enable disk formation is uncertain .",
    "@xcite investigated the effects of ambipolar diffusion on magnetic braking and disk formation under the self - similar assumption and thin - disk approximation .",
    "they showed that rotationally supported disks can indeed form even in strongly magnetized cores , although this is by no means guaranteed .",
    "a particular complication is the hydromagnetic accretion shock of c - type produced by the magnetic flux left behind by the mass that has gone into the central object @xcite .",
    "the increase in field strength and decrease in infall speed inside the shock and in the postshock region tend to enhance the magnetic braking ( in a manner akin to the quasistatic phase of subcritical cloud evolution , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , whereas the slippage of field lines relative to neutral matter in the azimuthal direction tends to decrease it . whether there is enough angular momentum left in the accreting material after passing through the c - shock to form an appreciable disk is uncertain , as demonstrated by @xcite semi - analytically in 1d",
    "numerical study of this problem in 2d is underway ( mellon & li , in preparation ) .",
    "theory of disk formation will be incomplete without a treatment of protostellar wind .",
    "it is likely that the wind removes the bulk of not only the mass , but also the angular momentum , of a ( low - mass ) star forming core , at least for regions like the taurus clouds , where the typical mass of a core is well above that of a yso .",
    "as discussed in [ dispersal ] , there is the possibility of late - time disk formation after the wind has stripped away most of the ( slowly rotating ) envelope that impedes disk formation through magnetic braking .",
    "the role of protostellar wind in the evolution of angular momentum in star formation in general and disk formation in particular remains to be quantified .",
    "the various refinements outlined above are not mutually exclusive .",
    "however , it will be a daunting , if not impossible , task to implement all of them at the same time .",
    "fortunately the calculations can be guided by high resolution observations with increasingly powerful interferometers , especially alma .",
    "we have performed a set of axisymmetric calculations of protostellar collapse phase of star formation in rotating cores magnetized to different degrees , expanding on the work of als03 .",
    "the goal is to determine how magnetic braking affects disk formation in the ideal mhd limit .",
    "the main conclusions are :    \\1 .",
    "protostellar disks can be disrupted by weak magnetic fields corresponding to mass - to - flux ratio @xmath181 .",
    "this is made possible by the tight wrapping of the disk field lines , which increases the rate of magnetic braking , and the long braking time compared with the disk rotation period . in our illustrative calculations ,",
    "the disk disruption begins around @xmath1 .",
    "magnetic braking disrupts the rotationally supported disk by creating regions of rapid , supersonic collapse in the disk .",
    "these regions are separated by one or more centrifugal barriers , where the rapid infall is halt temporarily and the magnetic braking is locally enhanced .",
    "the number of centrifugal barriers decreases as the core becomes more strongly magnetized .",
    "multiple centrifugal barriers , if observed , would clinch the case for disk disruption by magnetic braking .",
    "surrounding the strongly braked disk of spatially alternating collapse and stagnation is a vertically extended structure supported by a combination of ( toroidal ) magnetic field and rotation  a `` magnetogyrosphere ''  where the bulk of the angular momentum of the collapsed material is stored .",
    "the magnetogyrosphere may be detectable interferometrically , although the detection may be complicated by interaction with protostellar winds .",
    "we suggest that the wind may play a key role in determining not only the mass but also the angular momentum of a stellar system .",
    "\\4 . even in the extremely weak field cases of @xmath252 , where a rotationally - supported , equilibrium disk is formed in the ideal mhd limit",
    ", the magnetic field can still be dynamically important .",
    "it can be amplified to the extent that its pressure dominates the thermal pressure both in the disk and its surrounding region , at least in 2d .",
    "the field may affect the fragmentation properties of the disk , and seed the mri , although high resolution 3d simulations are required to fully quantify its dynamical effects .",
    "\\5 . in relatively strongly magnetized cores of @xmath253 , the disk formation",
    "is completely suppressed , and the bulk of the angular momentum of the collapsed material is ejected out of the system via a low - speed , magnetic braking - driven wind , as found previously .",
    "a new feature is that the mass accretion on to the central object is highly episodic , because of magnetic reconnection .",
    "how this and other behaviors are modified by nonideal mhd effects , particularly ambipolar diffusion , remains to be quantified .    in summary",
    ", our calculations have shown that in the ideal mhd limit the magnetic braking is strong enough to prevent the formation of a persistent , rotationally supported , protostellar disk in all but the unrealistically weak field cases . since disks are observed around many , if not all , young stellar objects , this result presents an interesting conundrum that must be resolved .",
    "for such a disk to form in dense cores magnetized to a realistic level , magnetic braking must be weakened one way or another , perhaps through a combination of nonideal mhd effects and protostellar winds . quantifying these effects should be a major goal of future research in this area .",
