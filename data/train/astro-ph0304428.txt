    "fundamental research on the structure and evolution of stars , molecular clouds , and galaxies is still very important @xcite . as a rule",
    ", a family of the lane - emden ( le ) equations classified by the polytrope indices @xmath0 is known to be the most powerful tool to investigate the self - gravitating polytropic equilibria @xcite .",
    "so far , many numerical and semi - analytical works have been devoted to seeking solutions @xcite , which include the non - singular function with @xmath1 for an isothermal polytropic sphere @xcite . removing infinite divergence of the enclosed mass , some modified models are used to depict the globular clusters , intergalactic media , clusters of galaxies , and so forth @xcite .",
    "prior to modern numerical methods @xcite , the pioneering stellar model proposed by eddington , which is based on the solution of the le equation with the polytrope index of @xmath2 , could be useful to envisage stellar interiors , although the complexities such as transport processes and non - ideal equation of state ( eos ) have been omitted .",
    "regarding the study of the interstellar medium ( ism ) , it seems that some classes of the le equations shed light on dark molecular clouds and their condensations @xcite .",
    "however , in the general case that the pressure which supports the celestial objects is provided largely by the thermal motions of particles , we need to pay attention to the extensive use of the le equation with a specified index . for heuristic ways",
    ", we explain this crucial point below .",
    "let us suppose that the object sustains its own self - gravity due to the total pressure of @xmath3 , where the partial pressures of gas and radiation field are described by the eos of @xmath4 ( t / v)$ ] and @xmath5 , respectively . here",

    "hence , we obtain the polytropic relation as follows : @xmath15^{1/3 } v^{-4/3}(r).\\ ] ] if we assume @xmath16 @xcite , equation ( 1 ) has the form of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 ^ 4 ( 3/a ) [ ( 1- \\beta)/\\beta^4 ] \\}^{1/3}$ ] is the adiabatic constant . in this aspect , such a _ radiative _ polytrope leads to the le equation of index @xmath2 for gravitational equilibria .",
    "hereafter , we refer to this scheme , namely , the eddington model , as le@xmath19 , without further notice . apparently , for _ gaseous _ objects of @xmath20 , equation ( 1 ) does not match with the relation of @xmath21 involving @xmath22 for a perfect monatomic gas .",
    "the possible scenario that recovers the physical consistency is to allow the spatial variation of polytrope index . in equation",
    "( 1 ) such changes can be achieved by invoking the density dependence of @xmath23 $ ] , and a trivial solution of @xmath24 ( not shown ) .",
    "of course , these are not mathematical artefacts . in the astronomical context",
    ", the present scheme is applicable to study , especially , the high - density adiabatic cores deeply immersed in the isothermal molecular cloud , which are so - called first cores @xcite . as yet , there has been no distinct detection of the first cores .",
    "we hope for future - planed observations of molecular cloud cores in the range of millimetre and submillimetre wavelengths with high angular resolution @xcite .    in this paper , we present a self - consistent solution of a polytropic sphere for self - gravitating gaseous and radiative systems , going beyond the le framework . in the following ,",
    "we derive a generic equation for hydrostatic equilibria . in the present scheme ,",
    "if we know the whole mass and the mean molecular weight of the system , then the pressure ratio of gas / total pressure at the centre , which contributes to the boundary condition , is identified .",
