( [ wp ] ) . from general arguments",
    "one expects that @xmath122 @xmath123 @xmath124 to derive the uncertainty relations , we proceed with the variance matrix approach . the elements of the variance matrix in the basis of the phase - space variables @xmath125 in the non - commutative plane is obtained as @xcite @xmath126 where @xmath127 for example , it turns out that @xmath128 , @xmath129 , indicating that the particle represents by packet ( [ wp ] ) is located at @xmath130 and has a mean momentum @xmath131 .",

    "the above equations ( [ spread1 ] ) and ( [ spread2 ] ) determine the space - space and phase - space uncertainties under the effect of non - commutative dynamics . for instance , the variances are clearly enhanced in the non - commutative case ( @xmath143 ) .",
    "this suggests that by increasing the uncertainty , i.e. , the fuzziness of the unit cells in phase space , the effect of non - commutativity is to decrease the available degrees of freedom ( the total number of unit cells ) if the overall volume of the phase space is held fixed .",
    "the number of allowed states in a noncommutative system is essentially @xmath144 for a planar system of large but finite area @xmath145 .",
    "the fact that this number is reduced in presence of non - commutativity , was utilized to address the issue of fractional quantum hall effect in ref.@xcite in a fermionic system involving electrons , where the entropy gets reduced generically , which also displays non - extensive behaviour @xcite .",
    "one therefore expects a similar reduction in entropy in the bosonic case also , just on the basis of enhanced phase - space uncertainity ( [ spread2 ] ) , which in turn is expected to play a vital role in the entanglement property as well .",
    "the consequences on the entanglement of two particles will be evident later when we present explicit computations of the entanglement of bipartite systems in the presence of non - commutative dynamics .",

    "the same form of this commutative variance matrix @xmath149 can also be obtained alternatively from @xmath147 by making use of the linear transformation ( [ lt1 ] ) to express it in terms of the commutative coordinates .",
    "the various uncertainty relations can now be read off from this as @xmath150 clearly , by taking the spread @xmath138 of the momentum space gaussian wave packets arbitrarily large @xmath151 , we can find @xmath152 .",
    "this disappearance of the @xmath153 from @xmath149 , or the various uncertainty relations following from it , is a reflection of the fact that one does not expect to observe any non - commutative effect at the single particle level , if the commuting variables are used .",
    "we shall see subsequently that this feature does not persist in the presence of two or more particles , as the symplectic eigenvalues of the effective commutative variance matrix will start displaying @xmath0-dependence ( non - commutative effect ) , thus inheriting the original non - commutative features",
    ". however , in the limit of @xmath151 , the space - space uncertainty relations involving non - commutative coordinates diverges ( [ spread1 ] ) : @xmath154 , which is minimized only at @xmath155 as we have seen earlier .      for a commutative system the correlation properties of the two - dimensional gaussian state",
    "is completely determined by an @xmath156 real symmetric variance matrix @xmath16 . to study the correlation properties it is convenient to transform the variance matrix @xmath16 to some standard form through symplectic transformations .",
    "let us choose the basis vector for the phase space variables to be @xmath157 , where the subscripts @xmath13 and @xmath158 refer to the @xmath159 and @xmath160 components , respectively , and the superscripts @xmath13 and @xmath158 ( within parenthesis ) refer to the first and second particle , respectively .",
    "any variance matrix can be written in terms of @xmath9 block matrices @xmath138 ,  @xmath161 and @xmath162 as @xmath163 where @xmath164 represent the single particle ( co-)variances for the first and second particle , respectively , and @xmath165 represents the correlations between the two particles .",
    "we now extend the procedure presented in ref.@xcite to the case of a ( spatial ) two - dimensional system to transform any general variance matrix ( [ varmat ] ) to a standard symplectic invariant form .",
    "( refer to appendix i for details of this procedure ) .",

    "the stage is now set to formulate our prescription for studying the entanglement of a non - commutative system . to discuss the entanglement properties of two identical particles in two - dimensional non - commutative space",
    ", we must first define such states appropriately .",
    "we briefly recall here the arguments provided in @xcite that give the correct construction .",
    "in noncommutative spacetime , generators of symmetry transformations act differently , because this action has to be compatible with the star - product .",
    "the correct implementation of , say , the rotation operator @xmath169 requires that @xmath169 act on a two - particle state not via the usual product @xmath170 but through the deformed co - product defined as , @xmath171 , where @xmath172 $ ] is the inverse of the twist operator .    in usual quantum mechanics of identical particles ,",
    "all observables commute with the statistics ( or flip ) operator @xmath173 that exchanges the two particles : @xmath173 is _ superselected_. the twisted two - particle rotation operator @xmath174 does not commute with @xmath173 , but does so with the twisted flip operator @xmath175 ( an easy way to verify the second equality is to look at the action of @xmath176 on , say , plane waves ) .",
    "to ensure that statistics remains superselected , we therefore require that the two - particle wave function be @xmath177 where @xmath178 is the normalization constant .",
    "such a wavefunction transforms correctly under the action of spacetime symmetries ( roughly speaking , the wavefunction remains twist symmetric in all reference frames ) .",
    "it has been shown recently that these twisted particles can have some non - trivial consequences like violation of pauli principle @xcite and energy shift in the system of degenerate electron gas @xcite .",
    "though @xmath179 turns out to be an @xmath68 scalar as mentioned earlier and the technique of twist symmetrization is motivated by its generalizability to higher dimensions . indeed , general arguments coming from diffeomorphism invariance @xcite and quantum integrability @xcite support this .",
    "how does one generalize the phase space operators to the two - particle sector ?",
    "in standard quantum mechanics , the position operator in the two - particle sector is @xmath180 , of which we intuitively identify the first piece @xmath181 as the `` position of the first particle '' .",
    "this identification is strengthened by the observation that on applying the flip operator @xmath173 to this , we get @xmath182 , which is the `` position of the second particle '' . in the noncommutative case ,",
    "the phase space operators are the exact analogues of these : they are given by @xmath183 and @xmath184 , as one can be obtained from the other by applying @xmath185 .",
    "for notational convenience , one can formally divide the @xmath186 matrix into four blocks , i.e. , @xmath187 the left - hand upper corner block and the right hand lower corner block contains the elements of @xmath188 and @xmath189 , respectively .",
    "the other two symmetric blocks contains the mixed terms .",
    "the above matrix @xmath190 is obtained from the symmetric part of the matrix @xmath191 , where @xmath192 .",
    "the important condition of positive semi - definiteness that is preserved under symplectic transformations for commutative systems ( [ semidef ] ) , however does not generally hold true for non - commutative systems .",
    "this is because @xmath112 is preserved only by the matrix @xmath193 , i.e. , @xmath194 where @xmath195 is given by @xmath196 with @xmath109 is defined in eq.([twoancilla ] ) @xcite .",
    "thus , the strategy employed here will be to transform the variance matrix @xmath111 , to the effective commutative variance matrix @xmath16 using eq.([lt1 ] ) , which also corresponds to the ( co-)variances in terms of observables , as discussed earlier in section iib .",
    "the rest of the analysis parallels the one used for commutative systems , discussed in section iia . as a result of the transformation",
    "the non - commutative parameter @xmath0 enters into the effective commutative variance matrix elements .",
    "our prescription will be to first transform a general form of the noncommutative variance matrix to an effective commutative variance matrix , and then use the standard form for the latter to compute its symplectic eigenvalues ( see eqs.([vm4])([phys.y ] ) below ) .",
    "in general , any non - commutative variance matrix of two particles when transformed to the effective commutative plane will acquire @xmath0-dependence .",
    "it follows from williamson s theorem@xcite that the effective commutative variance matrix @xmath16 can be transformed by symplectic transformations to the canonical scaled diagonal form where one can separate out the @xmath0-dependence of the various terms .",
    "thus , one can write @xmath197 in the commutative limit ( @xmath105 ) , the uncertainty relation imposes the condition @xmath198 on the eigenvalues ( see , section iia ) .",
    "it thus follows , that the effective variance matrix @xmath16 is physical if and only if @xmath199 now , consider the matrix @xmath200 .",
    "it can be shown that this matrix has a spectrum of eigenvalues given by @xmath201/2 $ ] , for @xmath202 .",
    "since the matrices @xmath42 and @xmath203 are related through a symplectic transformation , it follows that the positivity condition is preserved , i.e. , @xmath204 if @xmath205 which turns out to be true in the example we are considering here .",
    "we therefore transform the non - commutative variance matrix into the effective commutative variance matrix using the relations ( [ lt1 ] ) .",
    "we then proceed in the same way as for the commutative system . due to the @xmath0-dependence of the symplectic eigenvalues of the effective commutative variance matrix , the condition analogous to the physicality condition ( [ phys0 ] ) for the commutative case",
    "is modified to a @xmath0-dependent relation here , given by @xmath206 where @xmath207 is the lowest symplectic eigenvalue of the effective commutative variance matrix when the space - space uncertainty @xmath208 is minimized . note that @xmath209 when @xmath105 ( since @xmath210 in this case ) , i.e. , for the commutative case , one recovers back the usual physicality condition for commutative systems . as a result the similar condition on the smallest symplectic eigenvalue of the partially transposed variance matrix ( ppt criterion ) also gets modified , showing that the entanglement criterion for noncommutative systems @xmath211 also acquires a @xmath0-dependence we will derive the explicit form for @xmath207 in the context of the example that we will study in section iiid .",
    "in this section we will provide examples of specific gaussian states for which bipartite entanglement will be computed using the formalism presented in the previous section . though our ultimate goal is to study the effect of non - commutativity on the entanglement of two particles , we will proceed towards this direction step - by - step . hence , following the sequence of the previous section , we will proceed by considering examples of entanglement in usual commutative dynamics in one and two dimensions , before launching into the non - commutative computations .",
    "this is in order to illustrate systematically the formalism provided in the previous section .",
    "let us consider two particles in one dimension described by the two normalized wave functions @xmath212 and @xmath213 given respectively , by @xmath214 where @xmath138 and @xmath161 denote respectively the spread of the two wave packets . if we now construct a joint two - particle state given by eq.([s1 ] ) , with @xmath215^{-1}$ ] as the normalization constant , one can observe that this @xmath216 two - particle state can not be written as a product of two wave functions of the single particle states unless the parameters @xmath138 and @xmath161 are equal and @xmath217 .",
