    "starting from pioneering works by zeldovitch and novikov [ 1 ] , and also by hawking [ 2 ] , the primordial black holes ( hereafter pbh s ) were subject of extensive ivestigations .",
    "the presence of pbh s may significantly influence on physical processes and effects in the universe ( such as nucleosynthesis , cmbr spectral distortions , or distortions of @xmath2-ray background radiation ) due to hawking effect [ 3 ] , pbh s may be a component of dark matter ( see e.g. [ 4 ] , [ 5 ] ) .",
    "the formation of pbh s is determined by small scale , but large amplitude inhomogeneities in the early universe , and the processes of pbh s formation , evolution and decay link the physical conditions of early universe with conditions in the radiation - dominated epoch and present - day cosmology . even the very absence of pbh s may significantly constraint the models of the beginning of cosmological evolution .",
    "usually the processes of pbh s formation are associated with production of the scalar mode of perturbations during inflation ( see e.g. [ 5 - 9 ] ) or phase transitions in the early universe [ 10 ] . in this paper",
    "we are going to discuss the first possibility , which allows to use the powerful and well - elaborated theory of instability of the expanding universe for analysis of conditions , under which pbh s can form .",
    "the theory of generation of adiabatic perturbations during inflation started from pioneering papers [ 11 - 13 ] .",
    "it was established that the rms - amplitude of metric perturbations @xmath3 is connected with the parameters of inflationary theory by means of relation @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the hubble parameter , @xmath6 is the velocity of the field , evolving during inflation . to get pbh s abundance in an observable amount",
    ", one should have @xmath7 ( see , e. g. [ 14]).on the other hand cobe cmbr data , as well as analysis of large - scale structure formation constraint the amplitude of perturbations @xmath8 at super - large scales . therefore to get pbh s one should increase the amplitude of the perturbations by a factor @xmath9 at small scales . unfortunately this can not be reached in the simplest inflationary models , since in these models @xmath3 logarithmically grows with increase of scale , and one should use nonstandard models having additional power at small scales to obtain significant pbh s amount .",
    "recently , several models of such type were proposed . for instance , carr and lidsey [ 6 ] proposed toy model having blue type spectrum ( the spectrum @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the wavenumber , and @xmath12 is the spectral index ) , and investigated the constraint on the spectral index @xmath12 associated with possible pbh s formation in such model .",
    "linde [ 15 ] has shown that blue type spectra can be naturally obtained in the two - field model of so - called hybrid inflation .",
    "another type of model having a spike in the power spectrum at some scale @xmath13 was proposed by ivanov , naselsky and novikov ( [ 5 ] , hereafter inn ) and kates _",
    "et all _ [ 17 ] , who employed similar models in contest of large - scale structure formation theory ] .",
    "they considered one - field inflationary model with inflaton @xmath14 and assumed that the potential @xmath15 has a `` plateau '' region at some scale @xmath13 , and has a standard form ( say , power - law form ) outside the `` plateau '' region .",
    "the field @xmath14 slows down in the `` plateau '' region giving increase of the spectrum of perturbations at the scale @xmath13 according to eqn .",
    "one can adjust the parameters of `` plateau '' region to obtain the desired increase of the spectrum , and consequently the desired pbh s amount .",
    "garcia - bellido _",
    "et all _ [ 8 ] and also randall _ et all _ [ 9 ] considered more realistic two field models having a saddle point in two - dimensional form of potential @xmath17 . like the one - field model , the evolution of the system of fields slows down near the saddle point giving an increase of the spectrum power .",
    "randall et all pointed out that such models solve several fine - tuning problems of the standard inflation , and therefore look very natural from the point of view of high energy physics .",
    "garcia - bellido _",
    "et all _ carefully investigated the process of pbh s formation in such models ( see also recent work by yokoyama , [ 18 ] ) .    if the primordial black holes are not super - large , they probably collapse during the radiation dominated epoch of the evolution of the universe .",
    "this means that the amplitude @xmath18 of the metric inhomogeneities inside the regions going to pbh s should be of order of unity to overcome the strong pressure forces during collapse of the perturbed region [ 14 ] .",
    "these large amplitude metric inhomogeneities are assumed to be generated during inflation as rare events in the random field of the metric perturbations .",
    "since the amplitude of the inhomogeneities @xmath18 is rather large , the natural question appears : to what extent we can rely on the linear theory of perturbations which usually gives gaussian probability distribution of pbh s formation ?    to answer this question",
    "we can apply the formalism of coarse - grained fields ( introduced by starobinsky [ 19 ] ) as an alternative approach to the linear theory that can describe large amplitude deviations of the field and the metric from the background quantities . according to this approach",
    ", the spatially inhomogeneous field @xmath19 is divided into two parts : the large - scale part @xmath20 , which consists of the modes with physical wavelengths @xmath21 greater than some characteristic scale @xmath22 , and the small scale part which consists of modes with @xmath23 . during inflation ,",
    "the physical wavelengths are stretched , and new perturbations are added to @xmath20 . this effect may be considered as a new random force @xmath24 in the equation of motion of the field @xmath20 , and usually the dynamics of @xmath20 is described in terms of diffusion equation for probability density @xmath25 .",
    "this equation was subject of a number of works in connection with problems of quantum gravity and large - scale structure formation .",
    "recently , it was pointed out , that this equation can be employed for calculations of the probability to find large amplitude peaks in the random distribution of field @xmath20 , and it was mentioned that such approach can be applied to the problem of pbh s formation [ 20 ] .    here",
    "we would like to note that when studying the effects originating after the end of inflation , such as pbh s formation , one should use the large scale part of metric instead of large scale part of field .",
    "contrary to the field @xmath20 , the large scale part of the metric , namely the `` inhomogeneous scale factor @xmath26 '' ( see eqns .",
    "@xmath27 for exact definition ) is the quantity conserving during the evolution outside the horizon , and this property allows to connect the physical conditions during inflation with the physical conditions during radiation - dominated epoch , when pbh s are formed .",
    "moreover , the criterion for pbh s formation can be directly formulated in terms of @xmath26 ( refs . [ 21 ] , [ 22 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the calculation of @xmath26 gives a tool to describe quantitatively the generation of non - linear metric perturbations , and the evolution of these perturbations into pbh s .    in this paper",
    "we calculate the probability distribution function @xmath28 in the model with almost flat region in the inflaton potential .",
    "the main idea of our calculations has already been applied in the models of so - called stochastic inflation ( see , e. g. [ 23 ] and references therein ) , and is very simple .",
    "when the field @xmath20 evolves inside the plateau region it slows down , and the random kicks ( described by the force @xmath24 ) significantly influence on its evolution .",
    "so , the trajectory of the field inside the plateau region becomes stochastic , and the time @xmath29 that the field spends on the plateau , depends on the realization of the stochastic process .",
    "the total increase of the scale factor @xmath30 during the field evolution on the plateau , is obviously determined by @xmath29 : @xmath31 . since different regions of the universe separated by distances greater than @xmath32",
    "evolve independently , the increase of @xmath30 corresponding to different regions is determined by different realizations of the random process .",
    "thus the scale factor @xmath30 varies from one region to another after the field passes the plateau , that is the quantum effects generate the coordinate dependence of the scale factor .",
    "the shape of function @xmath26 is conserved during the subsequent evolution of the universe until the scale of inhomogeneity crosses horizon at the second time . at that time , in the regions with significant contrast of @xmath26 the primordial black holes are formed .    using the approach described above",
    "we calculate the probability distribution function @xmath28 .",
    "with help of a simple criterion of pbh s formation we relate @xmath28 to the probability of pbh s formation .",
    "we show that in our case the non - linear effects over - produce pbh s .. ] although this result is very important qualitatively , it does not significantly change the estimate based on the linear theory .",
    "we use the simple one - field model , proposed by inn ( see also refs . [ 24 ] , [ 25 ] ) . due to simplicity of this model",
    "the bulk of our results are obtained analytically .",
    "we hope that our approach provides a reasonable approximation to the case of more complicated two - field models .",
    "we are going to discuss these models in our future work .",
    "the paper is organized as following .",
    "we introduce our model and discuss the classical dynamics of the metric and field in section 2 . in section 3 we obtain an expression for @xmath28 .",
    "we consider the role of non - linear effects on the statistics of pbh s production in section 4 .",
    "we summarize our conclusions and discuss applicability of our approach in section 5 .",
    "in this section we consider the classical dynamics of spatially homogeneous parts of metric and field in the simplest inflationary model with a single scalar field ( inflaton ) and with the peculiarity in the inflaton potential . in this case",
    "the system of dynamical equations contains only two dynamical variables -scale factor @xmath33 and spatially homogeneous part @xmath34 of the field @xmath14 , and reduces to the hamiltonian constraint equation @xmath35 and to the equation of motion for field @xmath36 @xmath37 where @xmath38 , and another symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "we hereafter use the natural system of units .",
    "we assume that the effective potential @xmath15 has a small almost flat region ( plateau ) between some characteristic values of field @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the potential is also assumed to be proportional to @xmath41 outside the plateau region @xmath42 at @xmath43 @xmath44 at @xmath45 , and @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "here @xmath48 , @xmath49 .",
    "as we will see below the size of the flat region is very small @xmath50 , @xmath51 so we can set @xmath52 . at sufficiently large values of @xmath53",
    "the kinetic term in the equation @xmath54 is negligible in comparison with the potential term @xmath55 and the equation @xmath54 reduces to an algebraical relation between @xmath5 and @xmath36 ( so - called slow - roll approximation ) @xmath56 from the equation @xmath57 it follows that the universe expands quasi - exponentially ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) at @xmath53 .",
    "it can also be easily shown that outside the plateau region the field moves with large friction at @xmath53 , so @xmath60 the friction dominated condition @xmath61 helps to simplify the integration of the system @xmath62 . integrating the eqns .",
    "@xmath62 with help of inequalities @xmath63 , @xmath61 at @xmath64 , we have @xmath65 and @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are some initial values of the field and scale factor .",
    "@xmath69 is the number of e - folds of the scale factor during the field rolling down starting from some initial value of @xmath14 and down to the field @xmath40 .",
    "the similar formulae hold at @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the number of e - folds up to the end of inflation : @xmath76 , where we assume that inflation ends at standard ( for @xmath77 theory ) value of @xmath78 .",
    "note , that @xmath79 should be rather large .",
    "for example , to get a feature in the spectrum at scales , corresponding to the solar mass , we should have @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , the value of @xmath39 should be greater than unity ( @xmath81 for @xmath82 ) .",
    "now let us consider the dynamics of inflaton in the `` plateau '' region @xmath83 . in this region the equation @xmath84",
    "is simplified to @xmath85 where @xmath86 .",
    "the solution of eqn .",
    "@xmath87 can be written as @xmath88 and for the field velocity we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the field velocity at the moment @xmath91=0 of entrance of the field in the `` plateau '' region . the second term in the eqn . @xmath92 and the first term in the eqn",
    ". @xmath93 are due to inertial influence of initial velocity @xmath94 , and the last terms in the both equations are due to nonzero slope of potential in the plateau region .",
    "the evolution of the field in the plateau region can be divided into two stages . at first stage",
    "the field evolves mainly due to inertial term , and velocity exponentially decreases with time .",
    "after some characteristic time @xmath95 the nonzero slope of potential @xmath96 starts to determine the evolution , the velocity tends to the constant value @xmath97 , and the field amplitude starts to decrease linearly with time .",
    "the time @xmath95 can be estimated by equating the inertial and potential terms in the eqn .",
    "@xmath92 , and is determined by the condition @xmath98 , where @xmath99 . as we discussed in introduction ,",
    "the spectrum amplitude is inversely proportional to the field velocity @xmath100 , therefore we need to slow down the velocity approximately by @xmath101 times to get the increase of the spectrum amplitude from the initial value @xmath102 up to the typical for pbh production @xmath7 .",
    "for that , we should fix the `` amplification '' parameter @xmath103 .",
    "our model has two possible limiting variants depending on the relation between the time @xmath104 of the crossing of plateau region by the field @xmath36 ( @xmath105 ) and @xmath95 . if @xmath106 the field crosses the plateau mainly due to inertia . in this case",
    "the parameter @xmath107 determines the number of e - folds during plateau crossing @xmath108 , and therefore the width of produced bump in the spectrum remains small and fixed .",
    "the model of similar type was discussed by inn .",
    "here we consider another possible case @xmath109 , where the field spends some time on the plateau , evolving in the friction - dominated approximation . in this case",
    "the width of the spectrum is determined by the value of @xmath104 , which is the free parameter of our model . instead of @xmath104",
    "we will parameterize our model by the quantity @xmath2-the ratio of wave numbers , corresponding to the fields @xmath39 , @xmath40 , respectively , @xmath110 .",
    "the parameter @xmath2 can not be too small @xmath111 and we take @xmath112 in the estimations . if @xmath2 is not extremely large @xmath113 , the size of plateau @xmath114 is of order of typical size @xmath115 .",
    "the typical relative size of plateau is very small @xmath116 thus , the correction due to the presence of plateau practically does not influence on the dynamics of the field outside plateau region and we can set @xmath117 . on the other hand , the size of plateau is much greater than @xmath118 - the typical size of quantum fluctuations , @xmath119 .",
    "typically , the estimate @xmath120 holds for arbitrary power - low potentials @xmath121 provided power @xmath122 is not very large .",
    "however the opposite limiting case is also possible .",
    "for example , bullock and primack [ 20 ] proposed the potential of the form @xmath123 @xmath124 where the constant @xmath125 is chosen to normalize the large - scale part of spectrum to the rms - amplitude @xmath126 .",
    "the flat region in this potential starts from @xmath127 and ends at @xmath128 , and inflation ends itself at @xmath129 .",
    "it was mentioned by bullock @xmath130 primack that this potential leads to strongly non - gaussian statistics of field perturbations .",
    "it is well known that there are two equivalent ways to describe inhomogeneous universe .",
    "the first way is to consider inhomogeneities as a small corrections to the homogeneous space - time and study them in the frameworks of linear theory of perturbations .",
    "another approach splits the metric and the field into large - scale part ( coarse - grained over some scale greater than horizon scale ) , and small - scale part . during inflation , the dynamical equations for coarse - grained field @xmath20 and coarse - grained scale - factor @xmath30 are equivalent to eqns .",
    "@xmath131 provided the quantum effects are switched off .",
    "the quantum effects continuously produce new inhomogeneities of random amplitude with scales greater than the scale of coarse - graining .",
    "these inhomogeneities should be added to @xmath20 and @xmath30 and effectively this leads to the presence of stochastic force term in the equations of motion .",
    "therefore , the dynamics of coarse - grained variables can be described in terms of the distribution functions of @xmath20 and @xmath30 , and in principal these distribution functions can provide the same information as the power spectrum of perturbations , and furthermore the coarse - grained formalism gives a tool for description of the metric perturbations with amplitude , greater than 1 .",
    "the effective dynamical equation for the field @xmath20 has the form [ 19 ] and references therein . ]",
    "@xmath132 where @xmath133 , and @xmath24 is delta - correlated random force , @xmath134 .",
    "the equation for coarse - grained scale factor @xmath30 remains unchanged @xmath135 the solution of the set of eqns .",
    "@xmath136 is extremely difficult problem , and can be done under some additional simplifying assumptions .",
    "for example if we choose the featureless potential , and consider the friction - dominated solutions of the eqn .",
    "@xmath137 , we can obtain the solutions describing self - reproduced inflationary universe ( provided the stochastic term in @xmath137 dominates over potential term , see for example linde [ 23 ] ) . in our case",
    "we can not use the friction - dominated condition in the beginning of the field evolution inside the plateau region .",
    "however we can adopt another simplifying assumptions : first we can set @xmath138 inside and near the plateau region , and second , we can omit the stochastic term in the eqn . @xmath137 outside the plateau region , assuming the field moves along the classical trajectory there . under these assumptions the statistics of the scale factor @xmath30 is totally determined by the time @xmath29 that field @xmath20 spends in the plateau region @xmath139 where @xmath140 is the value of scale factor at the time @xmath141 of entrance of the field in the plateau region , and @xmath142 corresponds to the moment @xmath29 , when the field leaves the plateau region . to see that let us consider the evolution of the scale factor @xmath30 in the comoving coordinate system . outside the horizon the hypersurfaces of constant comoving time @xmath143 practically coincide with hypersurfaces of constant energy density @xmath144 .",
    "on the other hand , the field @xmath20 evolves slowly during inflation and hypersurfaces of constant energy density are close to hypersurfaces @xmath145 , and therefore we can put @xmath146 . after the field passes the plateau region , the evolution of @xmath147",
    "can be described by the standard expression @xmath148 , so we have @xmath149 where @xmath150 is nearly constant inside of coarse - grained regions with comoving scale @xmath151 , but changes from one region to another .",
    "thus , the metric outside horizon has the quasi - isotropic form @xmath152 where we represent the scale factor @xmath147 as a multiplication of two factors : @xmath153 and @xmath154 . here",
    "@xmath155 and @xmath34 are determined by the classical equations @xmath156 , @xmath148 , and the spatial coordinates @xmath157 are coarse - grained over the regions with scale @xmath158 . to estimate the change of metric from one region to another quantitatively",
    ", we introduce the definition of non - linear metric perturbation @xmath159 ( remind , that @xmath160 is the time which the field spends in the plateau region moving along the classical trajectory when the stochastic term in @xmath137 is switched off ) .",
    "note , that in the limit of small @xmath161 , the metric assumes the form @xmath162 and the definition @xmath163 is reduced to the standard expression for growing mode of adiabatic perturbation outside the horizon .",
    "namely , in this case @xmath0 reduces to gauge independent quantities , introduced by a number of authors [ 11 - 13 ] , [ 27 ] up to a constant factor .",
    "the variables @xmath164 do not depend on time outside the horizon . therefore , using of these variables is very convenient to match the perturbations , generated during inflation with the perturbations , crossing horizon at the normal stage of the universe evolution .",
    "as one can see from @xmath163 the metric perturbations are determined by stochastic variable @xmath29 and the distribution of @xmath29 must follow from the solution of eqn .",
    "note , that the definition of non - linear metric perturbations should be taken with a caution . in principal , one can use another definition relating to @xmath163 by some non - linear transformation , and having the same limit @xmath165 in the case of small @xmath0 . for example ,",
    "bond and salopek [ 28 ] used the quantity @xmath166 to define non - linear metric perturbations .",
    "however , the criterion for pbh s formation can be directly expressed in terms of the quantity @xmath163 ( see next section ) , and therefore this quantity is the most natural variable for our purposes .",
    "although the assumption of constant @xmath118 greatly simplifies the problem it still remains rather complicated for a simple analytical treatment [ 29 ] .",
    "the general solution of this problem demands too much formalism [ 30 ] , and is not considered here .",
    "note , however that the simple asymptotic estimates are still possible in this case [ 30 ] , [ 31 ] . ]    for further progress we have to make some additional assumptions .",
    "we will consider below the plateau region of sufficiently large size . for this case",
    "the field approaches to the end of plateau in the friction - dominated approximation , which greatly simplifies the treatment of diffusion processes . to estimate the relevance of friction - dominated approximation",
    "we should compare the time @xmath104 and the time @xmath167 of the decay of the inertial term @xmath168 in the eqns .",

    "we assume this transition to be sharp , and therefore set the condition of absorbing wall at the downstream point @xmath189 @xmath191 note , that this boundary condition was used by aryal and vilenkin [ 32 ] for analysis of stochastic inflation in the theory with top - hat potentials . in that paper",

    "@xmath225 , the non - gaussian effects over - produce the metric perturbations of high amplitude in our model .",
    "to understand this fact , let us discuss the origin of non - gaussian effects in our model .",
    "there are two sources for such effects .",
    "first , note that the `` effective dispersion '' @xmath226 in eqn .",
    "@xmath219 depends itself on the value of the stochastic variable @xmath227 .",
    "qualitatively , it can be explained as follows . in the linear theory",
    "the dispersion @xmath228 is proportional to the time spent by the classical background field @xmath36 on the plateau . in non - linear theory the coarse - grained field @xmath216 plays the role of background field , and therefore the distribution of the family of neighboring to @xmath229 paths",
    "should be described in terms of the probability distribution with dispersion @xmath230 , which is proportional to the time spent by field @xmath20 on the plateau .",
    "second , the amplitude of large metric perturbations @xmath0 depends on @xmath227 exponentially ( @xmath231 ) , so order of magnitude increase of @xmath227 leads to exponential increase of @xmath0 .",
    "obviously , these two effects increase the probability of large amplitude metric perturbations .",
    "although the distribution @xmath219 provides very important information about the geometry of spatial part of metric outside horizon , it can not be directly applied to the estimates of pbh s formation .",
    "indeed , the distribution @xmath219 is formed by the field inhomogeneities with wave - numbers @xmath11 in the range @xmath232)$ ] . the process of pbh formation is determined mainly by the field modes with wave - numbers @xmath233 , where @xmath13 is the typical pbh wavenumber .",
    "the modes with @xmath234 compose the large - scale background part of metric at the moment of pbh formation , and do not influence on the formation of pbh s significantly .",
    "the modes with @xmath235 lead to high - frequency modulation of the perturbation with @xmath236 , which is also unimportant , provided the mode with @xmath236 crosses the horizon second time at the radiation - dominated epoch .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain the probability of pbh s formation , we should subtract the contribution of the large - scale and small - scale metric perturbations .    in general it",
    "is very difficult to separate the perturbations of a given scale in the frameworks of non - linear approach .",
    "however , we can estimate the probability density of the perturbations , corresponding to the smallest scale @xmath237 . ) . ] for that we simply put @xmath238 in eqns .",
    "@xmath239 , assuming that the random process starts when the mode with wavenumber @xmath240 crosses horizon .",
    "this procedure automatically subtracts the large - scale contribution of modes with @xmath241 .",
    "the small - scale contribution is also absent due to our absorbing boundary condition .",
    "we have @xmath242 from the eqn .",
    "@xmath219 , where @xmath243 , and in the limit of small @xmath0 we obtain again the gaussian distribution @xmath244 the distribution @xmath245 has nonzero first momentum @xmath246 ( the lower limit of integration should be -1 , since the metric perturbations with @xmath247 are cut off ) .",
    "the contribution of @xmath248 should be added to the background part of metric , and further we will use the renormalized metric perturbation @xmath249 instead of @xmath0 . the probability to find the metric perturbations @xmath250 with amplitude greater than some threshold value @xmath18 @xmath251 can be estimated as @xmath252 where @xmath253 , and we assume @xmath254 .",
    "the same quantity , but calculated for the gaussian distribution takes the well - known form @xmath255    the observed quantities ( such as , e.g. the matter density of pbh s in different cosmological epochs ) can be easily expressed in terms of the probability @xmath256 , provided the mass of pbh s and some criterion for pbh s formation are fixed . in our case the criterion for pbh s formation should give the information about the threshold value @xmath18 .",
    "since this criterion plays very important role , let us discuss it in some details .",
    "first let us note that pbh s are formed from high amplitude peaks in the density distribution which are approximately spherically - symmetric ( see e.g. ref .",
    "it can also be easily shown that the maxima in the matter density correspond to the maxima in the function @xmath26 .",
    "the form of @xmath26 totally specifies the number of regions going to pbh s as well as dynamics of the collapsing regions .",
    "therefore we formulate the criterion of pbh s formation in terms of conditions imposed on the function @xmath26 .",
    "the first criterion was formulated by carr in his seminal paper [ 14 ] .",
    "it was shown that an over - dense region forms pbh if the density contrast at the horizon scale @xmath257 lies approximately within the limits @xmath258 .",
    "the first part of this inequality tells that the over - dense region should stop expansion before the scale of the region crosses the sound horizon .",
    "the second part requires that the over - dense region does not collapse before crossing the causal horizon , and consequently the perturbation does not produce a closed world separated from the rest of the universe .",
    "then the criterion for pbh s formation was improved by nadegin , novikov and polnarev [ 21 ] ( hereafter nnp ) , and also by biknell and henriksen [ 22 ] with help of numerical computations .",
    "the initial condition used by nnp was chosen as a non - linear metric perturbation having the form of a part of the closed friedman universe matched with the spatially flat universe through an intermediate layer of negative density perturbation .",
    "the conditions for pbh s formation depend on the size of this part ( i.e. the amplitude of the perturbation ) , as well as on the size of the matching layer .",
    "the smaller matching layer is , the larger the pressure gradients needed to prevent collapse will be .",
    "therefore , the amplitude of the perturbation forming pbh must be greater in the case of narrow intermediate layer . in terms of our function",
    "@xmath259 the nnp criterion reads @xmath260 where @xmath261 is the value of @xmath259 at the maximum of the perturbation and @xmath262 is the same quantity outside the perturbed region .",
    "( see , e.g. [ 27 ] ) .",
    "therefore the estimate @xmath263 is in agreement with carr s result . ]",
    "the first number on the right hand side of @xmath263 corresponds to the matching layer of size comparable with size of the over - dense region , and the second number corresponds to the narrow matching layer .",
    "assuming the matching layer to be sufficiently large we take @xmath264 as a criterion of pbh s formation .",
    "once the criterion is specified , we can link the desired pbh s abundance @xmath265 with the parameters of our model .",
    "for instance , consider the model having the matter density of pbh s equal to the critical one ( the density parameter @xmath266 ) . in this model",
    "we have [ 3 ] , [ 6 ] @xmath267 equating the expression @xmath268 to the probability function @xmath245 , we have the equation determining the amplitude @xmath269 required for pbh s abundance @xmath268 as a function of @xmath270 @xmath271 and equating the expressions @xmath272 and @xmath268 we obtain the analogous equation for determining the reference amplitude @xmath273 when the non - gaussian effects are switched off .",
    "the solution of these equations is given in fig .",
    "one can see from this fig . that the quantities @xmath269 and @xmath273 increase with increasing of @xmath270 and @xmath269 is always smaller than @xmath273 .",
    "it means that non - gaussian effects over - produce pbh s in our model ( at least when the simple criterion @xmath263 is used ) , and the slope of potential can be steeper than that required in the gaussian case . typically , the ratio @xmath274 is about @xmath275 .",
    "say , for the case of @xmath276 , we have @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "we plot the probability function @xmath223 for @xmath279 in fig .",
    "2 .    in this fig .",
    ", we also plot the gaussian probability function @xmath280 for @xmath281 ( dashed line ) and the same quantity for @xmath279 ( dotted line ) . comparing the curves that correspond to the same pbh s abundance",
    ", we see that the non - gaussian curve is flatter having larger values of @xmath223 at large @xmath0 .",
    "the values of the gaussian curve with the same plateau parameter @xmath282 is smaller by many orders of magnitude than the values of the non - gaussian curve in the case of large @xmath0 .    finally , let us note , that the non - gaussian effects does not modify significantly the estimates based on the gaussian theory .",
    "as we have seen , the ambiguity in the choice of the plateau slope due to these effects is about @xmath275 .",
    "this ambiguity seems to be less than the ambiguity in other parameters and can be obviously absorbed by a small change of the potential slope .",
    "we have demonstrated that the non - gaussian effects related to the dynamics of the coarse - grained field ( inflaton ) and to the evolution of the large - scale part of metric over - produce large - amplitude inhomogeneities of the metric compared to the prediction of the gaussian ( linear ) theory of perturbations . we have derived an analytical expression for non - gaussian probability distribution for non - linear metric perturbations , and estimated the influence of non - linear effects on the probability of primordial black holes formation .",
    "we used the simple single field inflationary model with peculiarity in form of the flat region in inflaton potential @xmath15 , and power - law slope of the potential outside the peculiarity region .",
    "the key point of our approach is in the using of inhomogeneous coarse - grained metric function @xmath259 instead of the coarse - grained field @xmath20 as a basic quantity .",
    "this allows to match the physical condition of production of inhomogeneities during inflation with the `` observable '' quantities .",
    "our results can be considered as semi - qualitative only .",
    "the uncertainties come fromthe phenomenological character of our inflationary model as well as from the oversimplified treatment of the process of pbh s formation .",
    "the uncertainties related to the choice of parameters of inflationary model are mainly due to unknown form of the potential between the steep and flat regions , and also due to our friction - dominated assumption in the consideration of the stochastic process .",
    "these uncertainties can be eliminatedwith help of numerical simulations of stochastic process in more realistic models of inflation .",
    "the ambiguities concerning the criterion of pbh s formation are mainly due to the one - point treatment of this process .",
    "actually , pbh formation is nonlocal , and dynamics of collapsing region depends strongly on the form of the spatial profile of the density perturbation ( see e.g. refs . [ 22 ] , [ 35 ] for discussion of this point ) .",
    "the form of the spatial profile can be studied by means of n - point correlation functions of the coarse - grained metric and field .",
    "unfortunately , the formalism of n - point correlation functions is still not elaborated ( see , however the ref . [ 35 ] for the first discussion ) .",
    "note , that probably the influence of the spatial profile of the collapsing region may be taken into account by a redefinition of the threshold value @xmath18 , and this value might be effectively less . in this case",
    "the role of the non - linear effects would be damped .",
    "finally we would like to note that the form of the distribution @xmath219 does not depend explicitly on the specific parameters of our model .",
    "this allows to suppose that similar distributions can be obtained in more complicated models , say , in two - field models proposed in refs .",
    "[ 8 ] , [ 9 ] .",
    "we are going to check this very interesting assumption in our future work .",
