    "the benefits of using multiple antennas for wireless communication systems are well known .",
    "when antenna arrays are present at the transmitter and/or receiver , multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) techniques can utilize the spatial dimension to yield improved reliability , increased data rates , and the spatial separation of users . in this paper ,",
    "the methods we propose will focus on exploiting all of these features , with the goal of maximizing the sum data rate achieved in the mimo multiuser downlink .",
    "the optimal strategy for maximizing sum rate in the multiuser mimo downlink , also known as the broadcast channel ( bc ) , was first proposed in  @xcite ; the authors prove that costa s dirty paper coding ( dpc ) strategy  @xcite is sum capacity achieving for a pair of single - antenna users .",
    "the sum - rate optimality of dpc was generalized to an arbitrary number of multi - antenna receivers using the notions of game theory  @xcite and uplink - downlink duality  @xcite ; this duality is employed in @xcite to derive iterative solutions that find the sum capacity .",
    "dpc has been shown to be the optimal precoding strategy not only for sum capacity , but also for the entire capacity region in the bc  @xcite . unfortunately , finding a practical realization of the dpc precoding strategy has proven to be a difficult problem .",
    "existing solutions , which are largely based on tomlinson - harashima precoding ( thp )  @xcite , incur high complexity due to their nonlinear nature and the combinatorial problem of user order selection .",
    "thp - based schemes also suffer from rate loss when compared to the sum capacity due to modulo and shaping losses .",
    "linear precoding provides an alternative approach for transmission in the mimo downlink , trading off a reduction in precoder complexity for suboptimal performance",
    ". orthogonalization based schemes use zero forcing ( zf ) and block diagonalization ( bd ) to transform the multiuser downlink into parallel single - user systems  @xcite . a waterfilling power allocation",
    "can then be used to allocate powers to each of the users  @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of these approaches comes at the expense of an antenna constraint requiring at least as many transmit antennas as the total number of receive antennas .",
    "these schemes , therefore , restrict the possibility of gains from additional receiver antennas .",
    "the constraint is relaxed under successive zero forcing  @xcite , which requires only partial orthogonality but incurs higher complexity in finding an optimal user ordering .",
    "coordinated beamforming  @xcite and generalized orthogonalization  @xcite are able to avoid the antenna constraint via iterative optimization of transmit and receive beamformers .",
    "it is also possible to improve the sum rate achieved with zf and bd by including user or antenna selection in the precoder design .",
    "the sum - rate maximizing zf precoder can be found by comparing precoders for all possible subsets of available receive antennas  @xcite ; however , this strategy incurs exponential complexity on the order of the total number of receive antennas .",
    "greedy and suboptimal strategies for user selection  @xcite may also be applied with lower computational cost .",
    "however , user selection is outside the scope of this paper ; our goal here is to focus on the rates achievable under linear precoding . while all of these schemes possess lower complexity than the thp based methods , the use of orthogonalization results in suboptimal performance due to noise enhancement . in this paper",
    ", we consider the optimal formulation for sum rate maximization under linear precoding .",
    "much of the existing literature on linear precoding for multiuser mimo systems focuses on minimizing the sum of mean squared errors ( smse ) between the transmitted and received signals under a sum power constraint  @xcite .",
    "an important recurring theme in most of these papers is the use of an uplink - downlink duality for both mse and signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) introduced in  @xcite for the single receive antenna case and extended to the mimo case in  @xcite .",
    "these mse and sinr dualities are equally applicable to sum rate maximization .",
    "linear precoding approaches to sum rate maximization have been proposed for both single - antenna receivers  @xcite and for multiple antenna receivers  @xcite . in  @xcite",
    ", the authors suggest an iterative method for direct optimization of the sum rate , while  @xcite and  @xcite exploit the sinr uplink - downlink duality of  @xcite . in  @xcite and  @xcite , two similar algorithms",
    "were independently proposed to minimize the product of the mean squared errors ( pmse ) in the multiuser mimo downlink ; these papers showed that the pmse minimization problem is equivalent to the direct sum rate maximization proposed in  @xcite .",
    "the work of  @xcite was motivated by the equivalence relationship developed between the single user minimum mse ( mmse ) and mutual information in  @xcite .",
    "each of the approaches in  @xcite yields a suboptimal solution , as the resulting solutions converge only to a local optimum , if at all .    given this prior work in linear precoding ,",
    "an important motivation for this paper is to determine the performance upper bound achievable under linear precoding and to evaluate how closely pmse minimization comes to approaching this upper bound . in the single - user multicarrier case , minimizing the pmse is equivalent to minimizing the determinant of the mse matrix and thus is also equivalent to maximizing the mutual information  @xcite .",
    "this equivalence does not apply to the multiuser scenario . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the relationship between the mse - matrix determinants , the mutual information , and the maximum achievable sum rate under linear precoding in the multiuser mimo downlink , resulting in an optimization problem based on minimizing the product of the determinants of all users mse matrices ( pdetmse ) .",
    "furthermore , we underline the differences between the joint ( multi - stream ) optimization that arises from the pdetmse approach and the scalar ( per - stream ) pmse - based solution . while chronologically , the pmse approach was developed before the pdetmse formulation , we present pmse in this paper as a lower complexity approximation of the pdetmse formulation .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are :    * deriving the maximum achievable information rates for both joint and scalar processing under linear precoding and formulating the joint ( pdetmse ) and scalar processing ( pmse ) based sum rate maximization problems using mse expressions . *",
    "proposing solutions to these optimization problems based on uplink - downlink duality , and addressing several issues regarding algorithm implementation . * analyzing the performance of our proposed schemes in comparison to the dpc sum capacity and to orthogonalization based approaches .",
    "we demonstrate that a performance improvement is made in narrowing the gap to capacity at practical values of transmit snr , and show that the pdetmse approach provides the best performance of all proposed schemes .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ section : model ] describes the system model used and states the assumptions made .",

    "can then be formulated as @xmath95      in this section , we show that an mse - based formulation using joint processing of all streams ( rather than treating each user s own data streams as interference ) leads to an equivalent optimal formulation of the rate maximization problem under linear processing .",
    "we develop this relationship by using the mse matrix determinants .",
    "first , consider the linear mmse decoder for user @xmath30 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 when using this matrix as the receiver in ( [ eqn : msedlmodel ] ) , the downlink mse matrix for user @xmath30 in can be simplified as @xmath98    consider the following optimization problem which minimizes the product of the determinants of the downlink mse matrices under a sum power constraint : @xmath99    under linear mmse decoding at the base station , the sum rate maximization problem in ( [ eqn : ratemax ] ) and the pdetmse minimization problem in ( [ eqn : logdetmin ] ) are equivalent .",

    "we then see the relationship to ( [ eqn : linearachievable ] ) , @xmath102 with this result , we can see that under mmse reception using @xmath96 as defined in  ( [ eqn : mmserx ] ) , minimizing the determinant of the mse matrix @xmath103 is equivalent to maximizing the achievable rate for user @xmath30 .",
    "it follows that minimizing the product of mse matrix determinants over all users is equivalent to sum rate maximization , @xmath104 where ( [ eqn : mserateequiv ] ) holds since since @xmath105 is a monotonically increasing function of its argument .",
    "note that this new result represents an upper bound on the sum rate on all linear precoding schemes in the broadcast channel .",
    "the covariance matrices @xmath106 and @xmath107 in the mse matrix @xmath108 are each functions of all precoder and power allocation matrices .",

    "finding @xmath109 and @xmath110 jointly or finding only the power allocation @xmath110 for a fixed @xmath109 are both non - convex problems and are just as difficult to solve as the rate maximization problem .    in the sum capacity and smse problems , the problem of non - convexity is addressed by solving a convex virtual uplink formulation and applying a duality - based transformation .",
    "unfortunately , the sum rate expression under linear precoding in the virtual uplink is nearly identical to that derived above for the downlink , and does not admit a cancellation or grouping of terms to decouple the problem across users",
    ".    direct solution of the non - convex downlink problem for minimizing the product of mse matrix determinants requires finding a complex @xmath111 precoder matrix .",
    "we consider the application of sequential quadratic programming ( sqp )  @xcite to solve this problem .",
    "sqp solves successive approximations of a constrained optimization problem and is guaranteed to converge to the optimum value for convex problems ; however , in the case of this non - convex optimization problem , sqp can only guarantee convergence to a local minimum .",
    "this computationally intensive approach is the only available option in the absence of a convex virtual uplink formulation .",
    "moreover , the numerical techniques used for solving nonlinear problems do not guarantee convergence to the global minimum .",
    "this is clearly not a desirable method for finding a practical precoder , especially when one of our major motivations for using linear precoding is reducing transmitter complexity .",
    "we do not suggest that this method be practically implemented ; rather , we use it to illustrate the difference in performance between the solutions to the optimal pdetmse formulation and the more practical pmse algorithm that we propose in the following section .",
    "given the complexity of the pdetmse solution , we consider pmse minimization as a suboptimal ( but likely feasible ) approximation to rate maximization in the multiuser mimo downlink . in  @xcite ,",
    "the single - user rate maximization problem using linear precoding is solved by minimizing the determinant of the mse matrix .",
    "this solution is equivalent to minimizing the product of individual stream mses because the problem is scalarized by diagonalization of both the channel and mse matrices .",
    "it was recently demonstrated in  @xcite that the mse matrices can also be diagonalized in the multiuser case by applying unitary transformations to the precoder and decoders ; however , in the absence of orthogonalizing precoders ( e.g. , bd or zf ) , minimization of the pmse yields a different solution from minimizing the pdetmse .",
    "the pmse approach , based on scalar processing of the individual stream mses for each user , follows from the treatment of the optimization problems in  @xcite , where non - convex problems in the downlink are transformed to convex problems in the dual uplink . with this motivation in mind , we consider formulating the scalar optimization problem directly in the virtual uplink , and transforming the resulting solution to the downlink using the uplink - downlink mse duality in  @xcite .",
    "in the scalarized version of the rate maximization problem , the user s own data streams @xmath112 are considered as self - interference in addition to the multiuser interference .",
    "the achievable rate for user @xmath30 s substream @xmath41 can thus be expressed as @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the sinr and @xmath115 is the virtual uplink interference - plus - noise covariance matrix for stream @xmath41 of user @xmath30 .",
    "the scalar rate maximization problem with a sum power constraint under linear precoding can thus be written as @xmath116      with this scalar processing rate maximization problem in mind , we consider the mse - equivalent formulation .",
    "we begin by finding the optimum linear receiver , and can see from ( [ eqn : sinrul ] ) that @xmath40 does not depend on any other columns of @xmath109 .",
    "furthermore , it is the solution to the generalized eigenproblem @xmath117 within a normalizing factor , this solution is equivalent to the mmse receiver , @xmath118 when the mmse receiver in ( [ eqn : u_mmse ] ) is used , the virtual uplink mse matrix ( [ eqn : mseulmodel ] ) reduces to @xmath119 thus , the mean squared error for user @xmath30 s @xmath120 stream is entry @xmath41 in block @xmath30 of @xmath121 , @xmath122    now consider another optimization problem , minimizing the product of mean squared errors ( pmse ) under a sum power constraint , @xmath123    under linear mmse decoding at the base station , the optimization problems defined by ( [ eqn : ratemaxscalar ] ) and ( [ eqn : minpmse ] ) are equivalent .    using ( [ eqn : sinrul ] ) , we can rewrite @xmath124 as @xmath125 it follows that by using the mmse receiver from ( [ eqn : u_mmse ] ) , @xmath126 this relationship is similar to one shown for mmse detection in cdma systems  @xcite . by applying ( [ eqn : invsinr ] ) to ( [ eqn : ratemaxscalar ] ) , we see that @xmath127    since the constraints on @xmath128 and @xmath129 are identical in ( [ eqn : ratemaxscalar ] ) and ( [ eqn : minpmse ] ) , the problem of maximizing sum rate in ( [ eqn : ratemaxscalar ] ) is therefore equivalent to minimizing the pmse in ( [ eqn : minpmse ] ) .    note that this result has been independently derived in  @xcite .",

    "this drop in spectral efficiency may reflect a fundamental gap between the ( optimal ) nonlinear dpc capacity and the rate achievable under linear precoding , but it may also be caused by the algorithms convergence to local minima due to the non - convexity of the optimization problems .",
    "the pmse algorithm outperforms the bd and zf methods over the entire snr range when the orthogonalization - based schemes are forced to use all @xmath2 receive antennas .",
    "however , this this approach to orthogonalization is suboptimal ; the optimal bd and zf precoders may be found by selecting the best precoder from all @xmath167 possible subsets of receive antennas . at high snr ,",
    "the pmse and pdetmse precoders perform equivalently to the bd precoder with selection ; we have observed that the pmse and pdetmse precoders ( in conjunction with the mmse receivers ) behave like the bd precoder in orthogonalizing the channel at high snr .",
    "the biggest gain in performance over orthogonalization - based solutions occurs at low to mid - snr values , where bd and zf suffer due to noise enhancement .",
    "figure  [ fig : theoretical4rx ] presents simulation results for a similar system as fig .",
    "[ fig : theoretical2rx ] , but with @xmath165 receive antennas per user . in this system ,",
    "there are fewer transmit antennas than receive antennas ( @xmath168 ) , so bd / zf can not be employed without selection .",
    "we include simulation results for bd / zf with selection , but note the large computational complexity required ( selecting the best of 162 candidate precoders ) .",
    "we compare these results to a generalized orthogonalization based approach , referred to as nullspace - directed svd ( nusvd ) in  @xcite , and observe a large difference in performance at high snr .",
    "this gain in spectral efficiency can be attributed to nusvd s ability to use all @xmath169 receive antennas , whereas bd and zf are limited by an antenna constraint .    once again , fig .  [",
    "fig : theoretical4rx ] illustrates that the pmse / pdetmse approaches outperform orthogonalization , particularly at low to mid - snr values .",
    "this improvement in performance comes at the expense of additional complexity .",
    "even though nusvd and pmse / pdetmse are iterative algorithms , nusvd requires only one ( concave ) waterfilling power allocation after convergence of precoder direction iterations , whereas the pmse / pdetmse minimization methods employ numerical optimization algorithms ( sqp ) in each iteration .",
    "figure  [ fig : kplot ] shows how the sum throughput scales with the number of users @xmath29 , for @xmath170 transmit antennas and @xmath163 receive antennas per user at 5 db average snr .    ,",
    "@xmath170 , @xmath171 , @xmath172    the number of transmit antennas @xmath28 is chosen so that bd and zf can be implemented without selection , as selection - based bd and zf are exponentially complex with @xmath173 possible precoders .",
    "this plot illustrates how the proposed scheme takes advantage of the available degrees of freedom at the transmitter and provides throughput significantly better than the orthogonalization based bd and zf schemes .",
    "the pmse and pdetmse algorithms do not require the explicit selection of @xmath32 ; rather , this parameter is determined implicitly by the power allocation .",
    "however , we can force the pmse algorithm to allocate a maximum number of substreams @xmath32 to each user to gain further insight into its behaviour . in fig .",
    "[ fig:22vs31 ] , the number of streams in the @xmath165 system described above is varied from @xmath174 to @xmath175 and @xmath176 .    ,",
    "@xmath162 , @xmath165[fig:22vs31 ] ]    the achievable sum rate in this system decreases in the latter case , as the asymmetric stream allocation does not correspond to the symmetric ( statistically identical ) channel configuration .",
    "in this case , user 2 is restricted to only a single data stream , and thus can not take full advantage of good channel realizations . if the goal is always maximizing the sum rate , the users should be allocated the maximum number of data streams in as balanced a manner as possible .",
    "note however that the pmse algorithm can provide unbalanced allocations if desired for other reasons ( e.g. , quality of service provisioning ) .",
    "in contrast to the previous results based on gaussian codebooks , we now consider the selection of constellations for modulation to achieve a maximum throughput for a specified bit error rate ( ber ) target of @xmath177 on user @xmath30 s @xmath120 substream . since the pmse algorithm assumes unit energy symbols , we use @xmath28-psk constellations in our implementation .",
    "note that the prior assumption of gaussian noise - plus - interference still holds for a sufficient number of interferers under the central limit theorem .",
    "we propose two approaches for selecting the modulation scheme for each substream .",
    "this approach selects the largest psk constellation of @xmath178 bits per stream that satisfies the required ber constraint .",
    "the constraint is satisfied using a closed form ber approximation  @xcite , @xmath179 where @xmath180 is the size of the psk constellation .",
    "we apply the least aggressive of the bounds proposed in  @xcite by using the values @xmath181,@xmath182,@xmath183 , and @xmath184 .",
    "we note that this approximation only holds for @xmath185 ; as such , one can use the exact expression for bpsk : @xmath186    the bpsk expression can be used as a test of feasibility for the specified ber target ; if the resulting ber under bpsk modulation is higher than @xmath177 , then we have two options : either declare the ber target infeasible , or transmit using the lowest modulation depth available ( i.e. bpsk ) . in this work",
    ", we have elected to transmit using bpsk whenever the pmse stage has allocated power to the data stream .",
    "the naive approach is quite conservative in that there may be a large gap between the ber requirement and @xmath187 , the ber achieved for each channel realization .",
    "we suggest a _",
    "_ bit allocation scheme that switches between @xmath178 bits ( as determined by the naive approach ) and @xmath188 bits with probability @xmath189/ \\left[\\mathrm{ber}_{b_{kj}+1 } - \\mathrm{ber}_{b_{kj}}\\right]$ ] .",
    "this modulation strategy may not be appropriate for systems requiring instantaneous satisfaction of ber constraints ; however , the probabilistic method will still achieve the desired ber in the long - term over multiple channel realizations .",
    "figure  [ fig : sumrate ] shows the sum rate achieved in the same system configuration as in fig .  [",
    "fig : theoretical2rx ] ( @xmath166 , @xmath162 , @xmath163 ) under the @xmath28-psk modulation scheme described above .    ,",
    "@xmath162 , @xmath171 ]    the simulations use two data streams per user and a target bit error rate of @xmath191 ; @xmath192 data and noise realizations are used for each channel realization .",
    "the plot illustrates the average number of bits per transmission for user 1 ; due to symmetry , the corresponding plot for user 2 is identical .",
    "note that in contrast to the previous results based on gaussian coding using spectral efficiency , the sum rate in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate ] is the average number of bits transmitted per realization using symbols from a psk constellation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate ] , we consider using the psk modulation scheme for the pmse precoder and the smse precoder designed in  @xcite .",
    "examination of this plot reveals that using the pmse criterion is justified at practical snr values with improvements of approximately one bit per transmission near 15 db .",
    "furthermore , using the probabilistic modulation scheme ( designated `` pmse - p '' ) yields an additional improvement of more than half a bit per transmission across all snr values .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : ber ] , we plot average ber versus snr for the same system configuration as in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate ] .    , @xmath162 , @xmath171 ]    this plot illustrates how the naive bit allocation algorithm attempts to achieve the target ber of @xmath193 for all data streams under pmse , but also overshoots the target , converging to a ber of approximately @xmath194 .",
    "this can be attributed to the looseness of the ber bound mentioned above .",
    "in contrast , the probabilistic rate allocation algorithm not only increases the rate , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sumrate ] , but also converges to a ber that is much closer to the desired target ber .",
    "the remaining gap between the actual ber achieved and the target ber can again be attributed to looseness in the approximations of ( [ eqn : mpsk ] ) and ( [ eqn : bpsk ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have considered the problem of designing a linear precoder to maximize sum throughput in the multiuser mimo downlink under a sum power constraint .",
    "we have compared the maximum achievable sum rate performance of linear precoding schemes to the sum capacity in the general mimo downlink , without imposing constraints on the number of users , base station antennas , or mobile antennas .",
    "the problem was reformulated in terms of mse based expressions , and the joint processing solution based on pdetmse minimization was shown to be theoretically optimal , but computationally infeasible . a suboptimal framework based on scalar ( per - stream ) processing",
    "was then proposed , and an implementation was provided based on pmse minimization and employing a known uplink - downlink duality of mses .",
