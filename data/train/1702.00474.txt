    "the _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope , launched in june 2008 , has marked a revolution in our knowledge of the @xmath0-ray sky , thanks to the unprecedented performances of its large area telescope ( lat ; atwood et al .",
    "2009 ) . the third _ fermi_-lat gamma - ray source catalogue ( 3fgl ; acero et al .",
    "2015 ) , based on its first four years of operations , contains 3033 sources .",
    "this is a factor of ten more @xmath0-ray sources than known before the launch of _",
    "fermi_. interestingly ,",
    "only 238 @xmath0-ray sources in the 3fgl were firmly identified , e.g. through a characteristic timing signature , such as pulsations , for @xmath0-ray pulsars , or long - term variability , for active galactic nuclei ( agn ) .",
    "another 1785 @xmath0-ray sources were _ associated _ with objects in master catalogues based upon positional coincidence but were not yet formally identified , though .",
    "the remaining 1010 sources , i.e. about one third of the sample , had not even a tentative association and were referred to as _",
    "unassociated_. among the identified @xmath0-ray sources , pulsars are the most numerous class , with 205 of them identified to date - ray pulsars detected by the lat , see https://confluence.slac.stanford.edu/x/5jl6bg ] ( see grenier & harding 2015 for a recent review on @xmath0-ray pulsars ) . of these ,",
    "144 are radio loud ( rl ) , i.e. they are detected as radio pulsars , whereas 61 are radio quiet ( rq ) , i.e. no radio pulsations have been detected in spite of deep searches .",
    "one surprising result of the _ fermi _ mission has been the unexpected discovery that nearly half of the @xmath0-ray pulsars are milli - second pulsars ( msps ) , old ( @xmath2 1 gyr ) , less energetic ( @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 ) and low - magnetised ( @xmath5@xmath6 g ) pulsars , whose rotation has been spun - up by accretion of matter from a companion star . out of the 93 @xmath0-ray msps ,",
    "73 are indeed in binary systems with white dwarf ( wd ) or low mass main sequence ( ms ) companions .",
    "of particular interest are a class of msps with tight orbital periods ( @xmath7 d ) : the black widows ( bws ) , with companion masses @xmath8 , and the redbacks ( rbs ) , with @xmath9 ( roberts 2013 ) .",
    "they owe their nicknames to female spiders of certain species that devour their male companions after mating , either completely ( bws ) or partially ( rbs ) .",
    "indeed , it is thought that in these systems the low masses of the companions are the result of their ablation caused by irradiation from the pulsar wind , which ultimately forms an isolated msp .",
    "some rbs alternate states of accretion from the companion , with enhanced x - ray emission and radio silence , to states of no accretion , with lower x - ray emission and radio loudness ( e.g. , patruno et al .",
    "2014 ) . therefore",
    ", rbs are key to understand the msp recycling scenario and the ablation process , eventually producing isolated msps , and the link between msps and low mass x - ray binaries .    before _",
    ", only a handful of such systems were known in the galactic field , i.e. not in globular clusters .",
    "now , this number has increased by a factor of five .",
    "one peculiarity of bws and rbs is their elusiveness in radio , owing to radio eclipses and radio pulse delays caused by the intra - binary plasma from the irradiated companion star surface .",
    "for this reason , optical and x - ray observations have been key to identify _ fermi _ sources as bws / rbs , prior to the detection of radio/@xmath0-ray pulsations .",
    "indeed , some of them have been identified as such from the discovery of @xmath10 day periodic modulation of the companion flux , which were associated with the orbital period of a tight binary system .",
    "these sources are 1fgl j1311.7@xmath13429 ( romani et al .",
    "2012 ) and 1fgl j2339.7@xmath10531 ( kong et al .  2012 ) , now identified as @xmath0-ray pulsars , with 2fgl j1653.6@xmath10159 ( romani et al .",

    "2016 ) being the next most - likely candidates .",
    "many unassociated @xmath0-ray sources at high galactic latitude might be either bws or rbs that escaped radio detection so far , but that can be pinpointed in multi - wavelength observations . therefore , back in 2014 we started a project to search for bws / rbs in a selected sample of unassociated _",
    "fermi_-lat sources based on the detection of optical modulations with a few hour periods from the putative msp companions ( see mignani et al .",
    "2016 for a brief account of this project ) .",
    "our manuscript is structured as follows : in sectn .",
    "2 , we describe the selection of the msp candidates and the multi - wavelength observations . in sectn .",
    "3 , we present the results , and discuss their implications in sectn .",
    "as a first step , we selected a starting sample of msp candidates from the unassociated _ fermi_-lat sources . since our project started back in 2014 , we originally selected these sources from the 2fgl catalogue ( nolan et al .",
    "2012 ) , which was the reference catalogue of _",
    "fermi_-lat sources available back then .",
    "all the sources selected below are also listed in the 3fgl catalogue ( acero et al .",
    "2015 ) , which thereon we assume as a reference .",
    "the candidate selection was based on their @xmath0-ray spectral and temporal characteristics and was implemented through the results of an artificial neural network classification code , fully described in salvetti ( 2016 ) .",
    "the success of our candidate selection method has been confirmed a posteriori by the results of the classification code of saz parkinson et al .",
    "( 2016 ) , which classified all our candidates as msps .    as a second step , we narrowed down the candidate selection to those @xmath0-ray sources with small @xmath0-ray error ellipses ( @xmath11 ) and with x - ray coverage from either _ xmm - newton _ , _",
    "chandra _ or _",
    "swift_. this is because msps are also x - ray sources , with the x - ray emission produced from the pulsar magnetosphere ( or hot polar caps on the pulsar surface ) and/or from the intra - binary shock ( roberts 2013 ) .",
    "finally , we selected candidates for which multi - epoch photometry measurements were available from public optical sky surveys and/or for which we obtained follow - up imaging observations with ground - based optical facilities ( see sectn .  2.1 for details ) . in this way , we selected a sample of 12 msp candidates , including the now known rb candidates 3fgl j0523.3@xmath12528 , j1653.6@xmath10158 , and j2039.6@xmath15618 ( table  [ opt ] ) .",

    "( 2016 ) for the description of their classification as msp candidates .",
    "an account of the available x - ray and optical observations is given in the next two sections and is summarised in table  [ opt ] .",
    "all our targets have an adequate x - ray coverage of the lat error boxes with either _ swift _ ( burrows et al .",
    "2005 ) or _ xmm - newton _",
    "( strder et al .  2001 ; turner et al .  2001 ) .",

    "( garmire et al .  2003 ) .",
    "we reduced and analysed the _ xmm - newton _  data through the most recent release of the _ xmm - newton _  science analysis software ( _ sas _ ) v15.0 .",
    "we performed a standard data processing , using the epproc and emproc tools , and screening for high particle background time interval following salvetti et al .",
    "for the _ chandra _  data analysis we used the chandra interactive analysis of observation ( _ ciao _ ) software version 4.8",

    "swift _  data were processed and filtered with standard procedures and quality cuts using ftools tasks in the heasoft software package v6.19 and the calibration files in the latest calibration database release .",
    "ten sources in our sample were observed as part of the catalina sky survey , a program of three optical sky surveys covering the whole sky @xmath12 above and below the galactic plane ( drake et al .",
    "2009 ) . in the northern hemisphere ,",
    "the catalina sky survey is carried out with two wide - field telescopes : the 0.7 m schmidt at the mount bigelow observatory ( arizona ) , which produces the catalina schmidt survey ( css ) , and the 1.5 m reflector at mount lemmon observatory ( arizona ) , which produces the mount lemmon survey ( mls ) . in the southern hemisphere",
    ", the 0.5 m schmidt telescope ( siding spring , australia ) was retired at the end of 2013 and only archival observations produced by the siding spring survey ( sss ) are available .",
    "the catalina sky survey is carried out with a cadence of days to months down to limiting magnitudes @xmath1321.5 per pass .",
    "we carried out dedicated follow - up observations of seven of the msp candidates in our sample with the gamma - ray burst optical / near - infrared detector ( grond ; greiner et al .",
    "2008 ) at the mpi / eso 2.2 m telescope on la silla ( chile ) . for five of these candidates",
    "we have also multi - epoch data from the catalina sky survey .",
    "we carried out simultaneous observations in the optical @xmath14 and near - infrared @xmath15 bands repeated with a regular cadence on two or more consecutive nights .",
    "the observations were split into sequences of four 115 s dithered exposures in the optical and forty eight 10 s dithered exposures in the near - ir . to cope with the right ascension distribution of our targets , the observations were distributed in two runs , in august 2014 and february 2015 .",
    "the data were processed and calibrated using the grond pipeline ( krhler et al .",
    "2008 ; yoldas et al .  2008 ) .",
    "the astrometry calibration was computed on single exposures against stars selected from the usno - b1.0 catalogue ( monet et al .",
    "2003 ) in the optical bands and the 2mass catalogue ( skrutskie et al .",
    "2006 ) in the near - ir bands , yielding an accuracy of 03 with respect to the chosen reference frame .",
    "the photometric calibration in the optical was computed against close - by fields from the sloan digital sky survey ( york et al .",
    "2000 ) , whereas in the near - ir it was computed against 2mass stars in the grond field of view .",
    "the accuracy of the absolute photometry calibration was 0.02 magnitudes in the g@xmath16 , r@xmath16 , i@xmath16 , z@xmath16 bands , 0.03 magnitudes in j and h , and 0.05 in the k@xmath17 band .",
    "a separate automated variability analysis was then executed on the photometry result files of the standard grond pipeline for all sources in the field of view using a code specifically developed at mpe .",
    "as a first step , we looked for candidate x - ray counterparts to the lat sources that are not yet firmly identified in the x - rays , i.e. all sources in table  [ opt ] except the three rb candidates .",
    "we performed a standard data analysis and source detection in the 0.310 kev energy band of the _ xmm - newton_-epic , _ chandra_-acis and _ swift_-xrt observations ( e.g. , salvetti et al .  2015 and marelli et al .",
    "we focused on the x - ray sources detected at a significance @xmath18 inside , or close to , the 95% confidence 3fgl error ellipse to search for the possible counterparts to each @xmath0-ray source .",
    "for each of these x - ray sources we performed a spectral and timing analysis using _ xspec _ v12.9 and _ xronos _",
    "v5.21 , respectively .",
    "we extracted x - ray fluxes by fitting the spectra with a power - law ( pl ) model using either a @xmath19 or the c - statistic ( cash 1979 ) in the case of low counts ( @xmath20 100 photons ) . for sources characterised by a low statistics",
    ", we fixed the column density to the value of the galactic @xmath21 integrated along the line of sight ( dickley & lockman 1990 ) and , if necessary , the x - ray pl photon index ( @xmath22 ) to 2 .",
    "all quoted uncertainties on the spectral parameters are reported at the 1@xmath23 confidence level . for all sources we computed the corresponding @xmath0to",
    " x - ray flux ratio . as reported in marelli et al .",
    "( 2015 ) , this could give important information on the nature of the source .",
    "for all sources , we also generated background - subtracted x - ray light curves with at least 25 counts per time bin in order to evaluate the variability significance through a @xmath19 test .",
    "since bws and rbs are characterised by an x - ray flux modulation with a period smaller than 1 day , which is associated with emission from the intra - binary shocks ( salvetti et al .",
    "2015 ) , we searched for periodic modulations in the barycentred data using the standard power spectrum analysis . finally , for all observations , we computed the @xmath24 x - ray detection limit based on the measured signal  to  noise ratio , assuming a pl spectrum with @xmath25 and the integrated galactic @xmath21 .",
    "as a second step , we looked for variable optical counterparts to the detected x - ray sources in either the catalina sky survey or in the grond data ( or both ) .",
    "therefore , our strategy is tailored on the identification of binary msps .",
    "only whenever we found a potentially interesting counterpart , i.e. with clear evidence of periodic flux modulation , we also exploited multi - band observations in optical , ultraviolet , and infrared archives for a better counterpart characterisation .",
    "we note that it was not possible to use the catalina surveys periodic variable star catalogue ( drake et al .",
    "2014 ) to carry out a systematic search for variable sources across the entire 3fgl error ellipses of our @xmath0-ray sources since this catalogue only covers the declination region @xmath26 and all our targets , with the only exception of 3fgl j1625.1@xmath10021 , j1630.2@xmath273733 , and j1653.6@xmath10158 , are south of it .",

    "interestingly , its multi - band uv  to  mid - ir spectrum shows a bump in the near / mid - infrared emission , that can be explained by the presence of two bb components ( sectn .",
    "[ sect_j2039 ] ) . since modulations are seen in the grond optical bands ( salvetti et al .",
    "2015 ) the hotter bb component is likely associated with the emission from the tidally - distorted companion star .",
    "since the same modulations are also seen in the jhk grond light curves , the emission from the companion star must contribute in the near - ir as well .",
    "the colder bb , however , can not be entirely associated with emission from the star , and its origin is unclear .",
    "more likely , it is associated with emission from cold intra / extra - binary material , perhaps associated with the ablated gas from the companion or a residual of an accretion disk , or both .",
    "interestingly , the size of the emission region is a few times that of the star roche lobe , which would corroborate the latter hypothesis . setting tighter constraints on the absence of periodicity in the multi - epoch _ wise _ data ( sectn .",
    "[ sect_j2039 ] ) of the source would be important to confirm the hypothesis that the mid - ir emission from the system indeed comes from diffuse gas and not from the surface of the msp companion .    for 3fgl j0744.1@xmath12523 , the detection of a 0.115 d periodicity in its candidate optical counterpart would exclude the association with a binary system consisting of two classical stars ( w uma or @xmath155 lyr binaries ) because their orbital period is greater than 0.22 days ( geske et al .",
    "the association with a cataclysmic variable ( cv ) would also be very unlikely because the period is within the 23 hours period gap of the cv period distribution ( southworth et al .",
    "2015 ) . however , we note that a period of 0.230 d , i.e. two times the value that we found , can not be excluded a priori since a light curve with two peaks gives a comparably good fit",
    ". such a period would make alternative scenarios more difficult to rule out .",
    "only the detection of the source in the x - rays , or even very constraining limits on its x - ray emission , together with an optical spectroscopy analysis aimed at measuring the radial velocity curve of the star will allow us to determine which period is the real one and which is an alias and , thus , to firmly discriminate between different scenarios .",
    "we note that it is possible that some of the @xmath0-ray sources that have a candidate x - ray identification , but are not associated with an optical counterpart ( i.e. 3fgl j1035.7@xmath16720 , j1744.1@xmath17619 , j2112.5@xmath13044 ) , are isolated rather than binary msps .",
    "however , this hypothesis can not be verified with the current x - ray / optical data .",
    "indeed , the low x - ray flux of the candidate x - ray counterpart to 3fgl j1035.7@xmath16720 makes the constraint on the x - ray  to  optical flux ratio @xmath210 obtained from the grond observations not compelling enough to identify this @xmath0-ray source as an isolated pulsar / msp . for instance , for an @xmath211 , typical of isolated pulsars ( e.g. mignani 2011 ) , the flux of the candidate x - ray counterpart to 3fgl j1035.7@xmath16720 ( @xmath197 erg @xmath37 s@xmath4 ) would require an upper limit to its optical flux corresponding to a magnitude @xmath212 , clearly unattainable with grond .",
    "this is even more so for the candidate x - ray counterparts to 3fgl j1744.1@xmath17619 and 3fgl j2112.5@xmath13044 , for which the optical flux upper limits that can be obtained from the catalina data are at least 23 magnitudes shallower than the grond ones .",
    "deep observations with 10-m class telescopes are , thus , required to obtain constraining @xmath210 values for all these sources .",
    "we exploited the value of the @xmath145 ratio as a diagnostic to determine whether some of the x - ray sources detected in the 3fgl error ellipses could be plausible msp candidates .",
    "the distribution of this ratio for different classes of msps ( isolated , rbs , bws , binary with wd companions ) detected as @xmath0-ray pulsars is shown in figure [ histo ] ( left ) compared to that of the young rl and rq @xmath0-ray pulsars ( figure [ histo ] , right ) , updated from marelli et al .",
    "we computed the histograms for the msps using the same criteria as in marelli et al .",
    "( 2015 ) for young rl and rq pulsars .",
    "we selected a starting sample of @xmath0-ray msps from the public list of lat - detected gamma - ray pulsars .",
    "then , from the literature we selected those msps with a clear , non - thermal x - ray spectrum , either associated with emission from the pulsar magnetosphere and/or an intra - binary shock in the case of bw and rb systems ( roberts 2013 ) , and we assumed the non - thermal x - ray flux as a reference .",
    "we warn here that for bws and rbs the emission from the intra - binary shock can not be easily disentangled from that of the msp magnetosphere , unless the detection of x - ray pulsations makes it possible to carry out phase - resolved spectroscopy to separate the pulsed component , so that some uncertainty on the latter component is expected .",
    "for msps with a composite spectrum , i.e. featuring also thermal x - ray emission from hot polar caps , we considered only the non - thermal component .",
    "finally , we filtered out transitional msps , whose x - ray emission can , at times , result from matter accretion from the companion star .",
    "we used the classifications reported in the on - line millisecond pulsar catalogue compiled by a. patruno as a reference to select the different classes of msps .    as we see , there is no substantial difference in the values of the @xmath145 for different classes of msps , although possible differences might be hidden by the still relatively small samples and be uncovered through future detections .",
    "the peak of the @xmath145 distribution for msps is somewhere in between the two peaks of the corresponding distribution for rl pulsars .",
    "differences in distribution of @xmath145 values for rq and rl pulsars are usually interpreted in differences in geometries and/or emission zones of x- and @xmath0-rays in the magnetosphere .",
    "msps have a more compact magnetosphere than young pulsars , so that we can argue that the emission zones for different wavelengths should be nearer to each other in msps and , therefore , less dependent on the pulsar geometry . in a way",
    ", such a sharp distribution in the @xmath145 for msps , with a mean value consistent with that of the rl pulsars , is expected .",
    "with such a rapidly increasing sample of new msps , new observations and theoretical models for msps magnetosphere are fundamental to study the mechanisms involved in pulsars emission .",
    "interestingly , the @xmath145 ratios of the candidate rbs 3fgl j0523.3@xmath12528 , 3fgl j1653.6@xmath10158 , and 3fgl j2039.6@xmath15618 , and that of the new binary msp 3fgl j1630.2 + 3733@xmath209psr j1630 + 3734 are all in the range @xmath213170 , close to that of the know msps identified in @xmath0-rays . the @xmath145 ratios for 3fgl j1035.7@xmath16720 and 3fgl j1744.1@xmath17619 , which have been recently announced to be @xmath0-ray pulsars ( clark et al .",
