    "recent data on the basic double - pionic fusion reactions @xmath12 and @xmath13 demonstrate that the so - called abc effect is tightly correlated with a narrow resonance structure in the total cross section of this reaction @xcite .",
    "the abc effect denoting a huge low - mass enhancement in the @xmath14 invariant mass spectrum is observed to happen , if the initial nucleons or light nuclei fuse to a bound final nuclear system and if the produced pion pair is isoscalar . since as of",
    "yet no quantitative understanding of this phenomenon has been available , it has been named after the initials of abashian , booth and crowe , who first observed it in the inclusive measurement of the @xmath15hex reaction more than fifty years ago @xcite .    the resonance structure with @xmath16 @xcite observed in the @xmath17 total cross section at @xmath3  =  2.37 gev",
    "is situated about 90 mev below @xmath18 , the peak position of the conventional @xmath6-channel @xmath8 process , and has a width of only 70 mev , which is about three times narrower than this process . from the dalitz plots of the @xmath12 reaction",
    "it is concluded that this resonance must decay nevertheless via the intermediate @xmath19 system into its final @xmath20 state .",
    "if this scenario is correct , then also the @xmath0 reaction should be affected by this resonance , since this channel may proceed via the same intermediate @xmath19 system . from isospin coupling",
    "we expect that the resonance effect in the @xmath21 system should be half that in the @xmath22 system . and from the estimations in refs .",
    "@xcite we expect the resonance effect in the @xmath22 channel to be about 85@xmath23 of that in the @xmath20 system .",
    "since the peak resonance cross section in the latter is 270 @xmath24b @xcite sitting upon some background due to conventional @xmath6-channel roper and @xmath8 excitations , we estimate the peak resonance contribution in the @xmath21 system to be in the order of 100 @xmath24b .    in the following",
    "we will demonstrate that in this particular reaction the resonance is not correlated with the abc effect for two reasons .",
    "first , the isovector @xmath14 system here is not in relative @xmath5-wave , but in relative @xmath25-wave . and second , in case of unbound nucleons in the final state the form factor introduced for the description of the abc - effect in ref .",
    "@xcite does not act on the pions primarily , but on the nucleons .    henceforth we will denote the resonance structure by @xmath26  following its notation in refs .",
    "@xcite , where a resonance with the same quantum numbers has been predicted at just about the mass , where we see this particular resonance structure . actually , the first prediction of such a resonance dates back to dyson and xuong @xcite ( @xmath27 in their nomenclature ) postulating a mass amazingly close to the one we observe now . also , a very recent fully relativistic three - body calculation of gal and garzilaco @xcite finds this resonance at exactly the position we observe . for a recent review of the dibaryon issue see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "since in the reaction of interest here the pion pair is produced in the @xmath28 channel , it provides also unique access to the question , whether this resonance can contribute to @xmath28 production and thus to @xmath29 production in @xmath30 collisions .",
    "known as the so - called dls puzzle the dilepton production at @xmath31 1.2 gev is strongly enhanced in the mass range 0.3 gev / c@xmath32 0.6 gev / c@xmath33 compared to what is expected from a conventional reaction scenario , whereas the @xmath34 induced dilepton production is in agreement with it @xcite . as a possible solution of this puzzle @xmath29 production via the @xmath26 resonance has been proposed @xcite .",
    "in fact , first simulations of this resonance scenario are very promising @xcite , if the @xmath26 production in the @xmath21 channel turns to be , indeed , in the order of 100 @xmath24b .",
    "finally , we note that this basic two - pion production reaction has been looked at so far only by low - statistics bubble - chamber measurements . as a result there exist no data on differential observables , just total cross sections at a few energies @xcite .",
    "therefore not only from the aspect of resonance search it appears desirable to collect high - quality data for this reaction channel , but also from the more general aspect to investigate , to what extent this reaction channel can be understood by conventional reaction mechanisms , which have been shown to work well for all @xmath34 induced two - pion production channels  see discussion section below .",
    "in order to investigate this reaction in more detail experimentally , we have analyzed a @xmath1 run at @xmath2 = 1.2 gev taken in 2009 with the wasa detector facility at cosy using the deuterium pellet target @xcite .",
    "the hardware trigger utilized in this analysis requested at least one charged hit in the forward detector as well as two neutral hits in the central detector .    the quasi - free reaction @xmath35 has been selected by requiring two proton tracks in the forward detector , an @xmath36 track in the central detector as well as two photons originating from a @xmath37 decay . that way the non - measured proton spectator four - momentum could be reconstructed by a kinematic fit with two over - constraints .    in fig .",

    "the requirement that the two protons have to be in the angular range covered by the forward detector and that the @xmath36 and the gammas resulting from @xmath37 decay have to be in the angular range of the central detector reduces the overall acceptance to about 25@xmath23 .",

    "since such a large failure has not been observed in @xmath34 induced , _",
    "i.e. _ isovector two - pion channels  and since there is no @xmath6-channel resonance process known , which could feed this low - energy region ",
    ", the reason for this striking failure must be in a low - energy two - pion production process , which is not taken into account in the valencia model and which has not much influence on the well - measured @xmath34 initiated two - pion production channels .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it has been shown that the so - called nucleon - pole term could possibly be such a process . according to their calculations it provides even the largest contribution close to threshold in the @xmath0 reaction .",
    "still , its contribution is far too low to account for these discrepancies here .",
    "we conclude that this failure points to an important isoscalar reaction component , which is not included in the @xmath6-channel treatment of two - pion production .",
    "it is intriguing that this failure appears to be largest in the energy region , where the abc - effect and its associated resonance in the total cross section have been observed in the isoscalar part of the double - pionic fusion to deuterium .",
    "hence we add tentatively the amplitude of this resonance at m = 2.37 gev and @xmath10 = 70 mev to the conventional amplitude . according to the consideration in the introduction we have chosen a peak cross section of 100 @xmath24b for this resonance contribution .",
    "it is amazing , how well the resulting curve ( solid line in fig.2 ) describes the data .",

    "3 - 9 ) . at the highest energy bin",
    "the observed invariant mass distributions follow closely the shapes expected from the @xmath8 process .",
    "this gets particularly clear in the @xmath61 ( see fig .  4 ) and @xmath72 ( not shown ) spectra , where pronounced peaks due to the @xmath54 excitation develop ",
    "compare corresponding spectra in the @xmath73 channel @xcite .",
    "actually all spectra are qualitatively similar in shape to those obtained in the @xmath74 channel with the exception of the @xmath75 spectra ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "these observations are understandable by the fact that on the one hand the @xmath8 process is the leading process at high energies in both channels , but on the other hand the @xmath14 systems have different relative angular momenta in these cases due to bose symmetry .",
    "whereas the isoscalar @xmath76 system is in relative @xmath5-wave , the isovector @xmath4 system has to be in relative @xmath25-wave .",
    "the @xmath25-wave condition favors large relative momenta between the pions and hence causes a suppression of intensity at low @xmath14-masses and an enhancement at large masses compared to phase space  and that is what is indeed observed in the @xmath60 spectra .    from fig .",
    "5 we see that the observed @xmath59 spectra exhibit distributions , which are substantially narrower then the corresponding phase - space distributions .",
    "obviously large relative momenta between the two protons are suppressed in the reaction of interest .",
    "again the situation is very similar to that in the @xmath52 channel and may be traced to the dominant @xmath8 contribution .",
    "the modified valencia calculations reproduce these spectra very well ( dashed curves in fig .  5 ) .    the @xmath62 spectra ( fig .  6 ) peak at @xmath77 as expected for a @xmath78 subsystem within the @xmath8 excitation process .",
    "the proton angular distributions exhibit a strongly anisotropic shape in agreement with a peripheral reaction process ( fig .",
    "also the pion angular distributions exhibit a pronounced anisotropy ",
    "see figs .  8 and 9 . both for protons and pions",
    "the anisotropy is significantly larger than observed in the @xmath52 channel . in the latter the two pions can be in relative @xmath5-wave , whereas here in the @xmath21 channel they have to be in relative @xmath25-wave .",
    "both the modified valencia calculations ( dashed curves in figs .  3 - 9 ) and those including the @xmath26 resonance ( solid curves ) provide very similar shapes for the differential distributions in reasonable agreement with the data .",
    "this similarity may appear surprising on a first glance and hence needs some detailed consideration .",
    "first , the observed strongly anisotropic proton angular distribution is very close to the one expected for a @xmath79 resonance  see ref .",
    "however , it is also equally well accounted for by @xmath6-channel pion exchange , which produces a prominent u - shape at energies far above the @xmath14 threshold , see also refs . @xcite .",
    "second , we expect a sizable effect from the dipole form factor at the @xmath8 vertex , which was introduced phenomenologically for the description of the abc effect , _ i.e. _ the low - mass enhancement in the @xmath80 distribution , in the @xmath12 reaction @xcite . different from the bound nucleus case , where the relative momentum between the two @xmath54s is essentially made up by the relative momentum between the two emerging pions , in the unbound case the relative @xmath8 momentum",
    "is mainly transferred to the two emerging nucleons  the heavy partners of the @xmath54 decays .",
    "hence in the case of unbound nucleons in the final state we expect the low - mass enhancement due to this form factor not to be in the @xmath75 spectrum , but in the @xmath59 spectrum . and",
    "this is also , what initially calculations with the inclusion of form - factor for the @xmath26 resonance show .",
    "however , this effect is counterbalanced by the requirement that the two protons have to be in relative @xmath25-wave , in order to build a @xmath5-channel resonance with @xmath81 . in case of a @xmath20 final state",
    "this spin - parity can be easily achieved by combining the spin 1 of the deuteron with the p - wave decays of the two @xmath54 states into the @xmath82 system such that in total we have a @xmath76 system in relative @xmath5-wave , which again is in relative @xmath83-wave to the deuteron . in case of the @xmath21 channel",
    "we have an isovector @xmath4 system , which by bose symmetry need to be in relative @xmath25-wave . to fulfill the required spin - parity",
    ", the @xmath34 system can no longer be in relative @xmath5-wave , but needs to be at least in a relative @xmath84 state .    that way , _",
    "i.e. _ by inclusion of the @xmath26 resonance , we obtain a description for both integral ( solid curve in fig .  2 ) and",
    "differential cross sections ( solid curves in figs .  3 - 9 ) , which is comparable in quality to what was achieved for the description of the the purely isovector channels @xmath52 and @xmath53 .    concerning the @xmath8 vertex form factor , which was introduced for the phenomenological description of the abc effect in the @xmath12 reaction",
    ", we would like to mention an alternative ansatz proposed recently by platinova and kukulin @xcite .",
    "they assume the @xmath26 resonance not only to decay into the @xmath20 channel via the route @xmath85 , but also via the route @xmath86 .",
    "since @xmath87 is a spin zero object , it has to be in relative @xmath83-wave to the deuteron in this decay process , in order to satisfy the resonance condition of @xmath88 . in consequence the available momentum in the decay process",
    "is concentrated in the relative motion between @xmath83 and @xmath87 leaving only small relative momenta between the two emerging pions .",
    "therefore the @xmath80 distribution is expected to be peaked at low masses .",
    "_ i.e. _ , the low - mass enhancement ( abc effect ) in this model is made by the @xmath89 decay branch and not by a form factor as introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . the enhancement in this model",
    "is further increased by interference of the @xmath89 decay amplitude with the decay amplitude via the @xmath19 system . applying this scenario to the @xmath21 channel we have in this case no decay branch via the isoscalar @xmath87 configuration , since the @xmath4 pair is purely isovector .",
    "hence the @xmath26 decay into this channel proceeds solely via the @xmath19 system and does not exhibit any low - mass enhancement ( abc effect )  neither in the @xmath60 nor in the @xmath59 system .",
    "this situation corresponds just to a @xmath26 calculation without form factor at the @xmath19 vertex .",
    "since then the @xmath25-wave condition for the @xmath34 subsystem is no longer counterbalanced by the effect of the form factor , the calculated @xmath59 distribution gets wider and close to phase - space worsening thus somewhat the agreement with the data .",
    "the first exclusive and kinematically complete @xmath0 measurements of solid statistics have been carried out in quasifree kinematics with a proton beam hitting a deuterium target . utilizing the nucleons fermi motion in the deuterium target an energy region of 2.35 gev @xmath67",
    "2.46 gev could be covered corresponding to an incident lab energy range of ( 1.07 - 1.36 ) gev .",
    "this energy region also covers the region of the abc effect and its associated narrow resonance structure around 2.37 gev .",
    "no evidence for a low - mass enhancement ( abc effect ) is found in the data for the @xmath4-invariant mass distribution .",
    "its absence is easily understood from the fact that the isovector @xmath4 pair has to be in relative @xmath25-wave and  even more important  that in this case of unbound nucleons the form factor introduced for the description of the abc effect in the @xmath90 channel causes a low - mass enhancement in @xmath59 and not in @xmath75 . in the latter , however , the impact of the form factor is counterbalanced by the condition that the two protons have to be in relative @xmath25 wave , in order to reach the @xmath81 requirement for the resonance .",
    "the differential data are reasonably well accounted for by conventional @xmath6-channel calculations with the modified valencia model @xcite .",
    "these calculations also give a good description of the total cross section at the highest measured energies .",
    "however , at lower energies these calculations lack up to at least a factor of four in cross section .",
    "since such a big failure has not been observed in @xmath34-induced reaction channels and since it concerns the low energy region , where no @xmath6-channel resonance processes are known to contribute , it has to be ascribed to an unconventional isoscalar process .",
    "one such process is the excitation of the @xmath26 resonance .",
    "its inclusion in the model description for the @xmath0 reaction leads to a much improved understanding of both differential and total cross section data .",
    "the necessary peak cross section of about 100  @xmath24b for the @xmath26 contribution agrees very well with expectations .",
    "after the experimental evidences found in the @xmath20 and @xmath91 channels , the @xmath92 channel is now the third channel , which is consistent with the @xmath26 hypothesis .",
    "if true , then this resonance should also been sensed in the @xmath93 reaction and  most importantly  in @xmath94 scattering , the _ experimentum crucis_. data for these reactions have been taken already by the wasa collaboration .",
    "their analysis is in progress .",
    "we acknowledge valuable discussions with c. hanhart , v. kukulin , e. oset , a. sibirtsev and c. wilkin on this issue .",
    "we are particularly indebted to l. alvarez - ruso for using his code .",
    "this work has been supported by bmbf ( 06tu9193 ) , forschungszentrum jlich ( cosy - ffe ) , the polish national science centre and the foundation for polish science .",
