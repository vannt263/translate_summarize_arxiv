    "nucleon counterpart in a number of interesting applications : both the total dis cross section as well as diffractive dis amplitudes exhibit the linear @xmath0factorization property . for these observables the nuclear dependence is fully contained in @xmath20 , which simply takes the place of the free  nucleon quantity @xmath23 in the relevant formulas . due to the color  singlet nature of the virtual photon , the same holds true for single ",

    "here we report on recent progress @xcite in extending the nonlinear nuclear @xmath0factorization to processes of the type @xmath26 , such as excitation of open charm and jets , @xmath27 in hadron  nucleon / nucleus scattering and/or dis at @xmath28 . from the lab frame point of view",
    "all of the above processes can be viewed as excitation of the perturbative @xmath29 fock state of the physical parton @xmath30 , by means of multiple gluon exchanges with the target nucleus . here",

    "gluon exchange approximation , one obtains the standard results of linear @xmath0factorization , with the gain of very convenient representations in terms of light  cone wavefunctions . for the nuclear target , all the pertinent single  jet cross section have unambiguous representations in terms of the collective nuclear glue @xmath20 , but now they become manifestly _ nonlinear _ functionals of the target glue . for illustration",
    "we cite the single  particle spectrum for @xmath44 : @xmath45 here @xmath46 is the fraction of the lightcone  momentum of the gluon carried by the measured jet .",
    "the first term is linear in @xmath24 , has the same structure as the free nucleon cross section , and is suppressed by the absorption factor @xmath47 $ ] , which vanishes in the strong absorption limit ( @xmath48 , the dipole cross section for large dipoles ) .",
    "the dominant contribution at strong absorption is the second one , which is quadratic in @xmath24 .",
    "similar formulas have been obtained for the transitions @xmath49 as well as @xmath50 , which both show a quadratic nonlinearity , and for @xmath51 , which displays a cubic dependence on the nuclear glue @xcite . here",

    "two simple corollaries on the excitation of _ slow _ ,",
    "@xmath52 partons are worth to mention : first , for all processes cited above , the spectra of _ slow _ partons universally allow a linear @xmath0factorization .",
    "second , the spectrum of _ slow _ gluons in dis from the excitation @xmath53 also allows for an exact linear @xmath0factorization representation of the form @xmath54 these findings are in line with the results obtained on slow gluon production in @xcite . for practical applications",
    "the linear factorization of slow parton spectra is of limited relevance though : one would have to ask for the transverse momentum @xmath55 of the produced jet to be compensated by particles from a widely separated region of rapidity .",
    "our results being fully differential in both transverse momentum @xmath55 as well as longitudinal momentum parametrised by @xmath46 also solve the problem of the @xmath55dependence of the landau ",

    "if one decomposes the single jet cross section into the contributions of the direct and resolved interactions of the fragmenting parton @xmath57 , then the cronin effect can be shown to be a nuclear modification of the resolved part @xcite .",
    "the seed for the cronin effect is contained in the antishadowing enhancement of the collective nuclear glue first discussed in @xcite .",
    "remarkably , although the saturation scale for a realistic nuclear glue is a modest @xmath58 gev , the cronin enhancement takes place at perturbatively large @xmath59 gev . in fig.[fig : cronin ] we show the cronin effect in the resolved parton interactions as a function of the transverse momentum @xmath55 of the jet parton for several multiplicities of effective rescatterings @xmath60 .",
