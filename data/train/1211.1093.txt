    "the self - assembly of macromolecules and particles is a fundamental processes in many physical and chemical systems .",
    "although particle nucleation and assembly have been studied for many decades , interest in this field has recently intensified due to engineering , biotechnological and imaging advances at the nanoscale level @xcite .",
    "aggregating atoms and molecules can lead to the design of new materials useful for surface coatings @xcite , electronics @xcite , drug delivery @xcite and catalysis @xcite .",
    "examples include the self - assembly of dna structures @xcite into polyhedral nanocapsules useful for transporting drugs @xcite or the self - assembly of semiconducting quantum dots to be used as quantum computing bits @xcite .",
    "other important examples of molecular self - assembly may be found in cell physiology or virology where proteins aggregate to form ion channels , viral capsids and plaques implicated in neurological diseases .",
    "one example is the rare self - assembly of fibrous protein aggregates such as @xmath0amyloid that have long been suspected to play a role in neurodegenerative conditions such as alzheimer s , parkinson s , and huntington s disease @xcite . in prion diseases , individual prp@xmath1 proteins misfold into prp@xmath2 prions which subsequently self - assemble into fibrils .",
    "the aggregation of misfolded proteins in neurodegenerative diseases is a rare event , usually involving a very low concentration of prions .",
    "fibril nucleation also appears to occur slowly ; however once a critical size of about ten proteins is reached , the fibril stabilizes and the growth process accelerates @xcite .",
    "free monomers . at a specific intermediate time @xmath3 in this depicted realization , there are six free monomers , four dimers , four trimers , and one cluster of size four . for each realization of this process , there will be a specific time @xmath4 at which a maximum cluster of size @xmath5 in this example is first formed ( blue cluster).,width=326 ]    viral proteins may also self - assemble to form capsid shells in the form of helices , icosahedral , dodecahedra , depending on virus type .",
    "a typical assembly process will involve several steps where dozens of dimers aggregate to form more complex subunits which later cooperatively assemble into the capsid shell .",
    "usually , capsid formation requires hundreds of protein subunits that self - assemble over a period of seconds to hours , depending on experimental conditions @xcite .",
    "in addition to these two examples , many other biological processes involve a fixed  maximum \" cluster size  of tens or hundreds of units  at which the process is completed or beyond which the dynamics change @xcite . at times , the assembly process may involve coagulation and fragmentation of clusters as well , such as in the case of telomere aggregation in the yeast nucleus @xcite . developing a stochastic self - assembly model with a fixed `` maximum '' cluster size",
    "is thus important for our understanding of a large class of biological phenomena .",
    "theoretical models for self - assembly have typically described mean - field concentrations of clusters of all possible sizes using the well - studied mass - action , becker - dring equations @xcite . while master equations for the fully stochastic nucleation and growth problem have been derived , and initial analyses and simulations performed @xcite , there has been relatively less work on the stochastic self - assembly problem .",
    "we have recently shown that in finite systems , where the maximum cluster size is capped , results from mass - action equations are inaccurate and that in this case a discrete stochastic treatment is necessary @xcite .    in our previous examination of equilibrium cluster size distributions derived from a discrete , stochastic model @xcite , we found that a striking finite - size effect arises when the total mass is not divisible by the maximum cluster size .",
    "in particular , we identified the discreteness of the system as the major source of divergence between mean - field , mass action equations and the fully stochastic model . moreover , discrepancies between the two approaches are most apparent in the strong binding limit where monomer detachment is slow . before the system reaches equilibrium , or when the detachment is appreciable , the differences between the mean - field and stochastic results are qualitatively similar , with only modest quantitative disparities .    in this paper",
    ", we will be interested in the distribution of the first assembly times towards the completion of a full cluster , which can only be determined through a fully stochastic treatment .",
    "specifically , we wish to compute the time it takes for a system of @xmath6 monomers to first assemble into a complete cluster of size @xmath7 .",
    "we do not consider coagulation and fragmentation events , but , as a starting point , focus on attachment and detachment of single monomers .",
    "statistics of the first assembly time @xcite may shed light on how frequently fast - growing protein aggregates appear . in principle , one may also estimate mean self - assembly times starting from the mean - field , mass action equations , using heuristic arguments .",
    "we will show however that these mean - field estimates yield mean first assembly times that are quite different from those obtained via exact , stochastic treatments .",
    "in the next section , we review the becker - dring mass - action equations for self - assembly and motivate the formulation of approximate expressions for the first assembly time distributions .",
    "these will be shown to be poor estimates of the true distribution functions , leading us to consider the full stochastic problem in section iii . here",
    ", we derive the backward kolmogorov equation associated with the self assembly process and illustrate how to formally solve it through the corresponding eigenvalue problem . in section iv , we explore three limits of the stochastic self - assembly process and derive analytic expressions for the mean first assembly time in the strong and weak binding limits . results from kinetic monte - carlo ( kmc ) simulations are presented in section v and compared with our analytical estimates .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our results and propose further extensions in the summary and conclusions .",
    "the classic mass - action description for spontaneous , homogeneous self - assembly is the becker - dring model @xcite , where the concentrations @xmath8 of clusters of size @xmath9 obey    @xmath10    where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the monomer attachment and detachment rates to and from a cluster of size @xmath9 .",
    "a typical initial condition is @xmath13 , representing an initial state comprised only of free monomers . for simplicity we set the volume @xmath14 .",
    "the above equations can be numerically integrated to find the time - dependent concentrations @xmath8 for any set of attachment and detachment rates .",
    "we have previously shown that eqs .",
    "[ homoeqn0 ] provide a poor approximation to the expected number of clusters when the total mass @xmath6 and the maximum cluster size @xmath7 are comparable in magnitude @xcite .",
    "although mass action equations provide approximations to mean concentrations , they do not directly describe any statistical property of the modeled system .",
    "nonetheless , one may be able to heuristically derive estimates of quantities such as mean first assembly times . to estimate the mean time to completion of the first maximum cluster",
    ", we must consider a truncated set of mass - action equations which treats maximum clusters as `` absorbing states '' so that once maximum clusters are formed , the process is stopped and the time recorded .",
    "thus , we set @xmath15 in eqs .",
    "[ homoeqn0 ] so that once clusters of size @xmath7 are formed , no detachment is allowed .",
    "this choice ensures that completed assembly events will not influence the dynamics of any of the remaining smaller clusters .    to estimate the mean first assembly time we may invoke the statistical concept of survival probabilities , and heuristically combine it with the deterministic solutions of eq .",
    "[ homoeqn0 ] . following standard notation ,",
    "we denote by @xmath16 the probability that the system has not yet formed a maximal cluster .",
    "this quantity is also known as the `` survival '' probability .",
    "its dynamics can be expressed using the probability flux @xmath17 out of the last not fully formed maximal cluster state , or equivalently into the maximal one , conditioned on the system still surviving so that     ( dashed line ) and as a function of the detachment rate @xmath18 , for @xmath19 , @xmath20 in panel ( a ) and for @xmath21 , @xmath22 in panel ( b ) . here",
    "we also show the exact results ( solid line ) obtained via the stochastic formulation in eq.[analytic ] which we derive in section iii .",
    "qualitative and quantitative differences between the two approaches arise , which become even more evident for @xmath24 , @xmath25 , as we shall later discuss .",

    ", the derived first assembly time will always be infinitely large , since the system has a finite survival probability even for @xmath38 , making the approximation invalid .",
    "alternatively , we may approximate eq.[flu ] as    @xmath39    this relationship assumes that the system is always is a surviving state ( not yet formed a maximum - sized cluster ) .",
    "however , eq .  [ sj ] also yields unphysical results at long times .",
    "a deterministic approximation that yields physically reasonable results can be obtained by finding the time at which the concentration of clusters of size @xmath7 reaches unity @xmath40 and imposing @xmath41 in eqs.[homoeqn0 ] . as an example , we consider the case @xmath19 , @xmath20 for @xmath42 ( and @xmath43 as illustrated above ) , find @xmath44 from eqs.[homoeqn0 ] , and plot the mean first assembly time obtained via eq.[heur ] in fig .",
    "[ heur_n=3](a ) . for completeness we also show the exact results obtained via the full stochastic treatment in eq .",
    "[ analytic ] , the derivation of which we will focus on below .",
    "what clearly arises from fig .",
    "[ heur_n=3](a ) is that while the mean first assembly times obtained stochastically and via the mean - field equations are of the same order of magnitude , they are also quite different and show even qualitative discrepancies .",
    "for example , the stochastic mean first assembly time is non - monotonic in @xmath45 , while the simple mean - field estimate is an increasing function of @xmath45 .",
    "discrepancies between the heuristic and exact stochastic results exist also for the case @xmath21 , @xmath22 shown in fig.[heur_n=3](b ) . here , most notably we can point out that for @xmath46 , while the exact mean first assembly time calculated according to our stochastic formulation diverges , it remains finite in the heuristic derivation .",
    "we shall later see that this trend will persist for all choices @xmath47 and that the heuristic approach does not yield accurate estimates .",
    "a stochastic treatment is thus necessary and is the subject of the remainder of this paper .",
    "to formally derive first assembly times for our nucleation and growth process it is necessary to develop a discrete , stochastic treatment .",
    "we thus define @xmath48 as the probability that the system contains @xmath49 monomers , @xmath50 dimers , @xmath51 trimers , etc , at time @xmath28 , given that the system started from a given initial configuration @xmath52 at @xmath53 . in this representation ,",
    "the forward master equation corresponding to self - assembly with exponentially - distributed monomer binding and unbinding events is given by @xcite    @xmath54    where @xmath55 if any @xmath56 and    @xmath57    is the total rate out of configuration @xmath58 .",

    "this leads us to expect that mean - field approximation to the first assembly time will be inaccurate when @xmath137 , but small . here , the trapped states ( when @xmath46 ) retain the system for a long time .    since infinite mean first assembly times are a consequence of the existence of trapped states one may ask what is the mean first assembly time _ conditioned _ on traps not being visited .",
    "to this end , we explicitly enumerate all paths towards the absorbed states and average the mean first assembly times only over those that avoid such traps @xcite . to be more concrete , we first consider the case @xmath20 . here , in order to reach the absorbing state where @xmath138 , one or more dimers must have formed .",

    "similar calculations can be carried out for larger @xmath7 ; however , keeping track of all possible configurations before any absorbed state can be reached becomes quickly intractable .",
    "for example , when @xmath22 one would need to consider paths with a specific sequence of @xmath157 dimers formed between the creation of @xmath9 and @xmath158 trimers until @xmath159 trimers are formed .",

    "since the mean arrival time to an absorbing state is the sum of the probabilities of each pathway , weighted by the time taken along each of them , we expect that the dominant contribution to the mean assembly time in the small @xmath45 limit can be approximated by the shortest mean time to transition from a trapped state to an absorbing state .",
    "this assumption is based on the fact that the largest contribution to the mean assembly time will arise from the waiting time to exit a trap , of the order of @xmath163 , since detachment is the only possible path out of the otherwise trapped state .",
    "the time to exit any other state will be of order 1 since monomer attachment is allowed . for sufficiently small detachment rates",

    "this quantity can be evaluated by considering the different weights of each path leading to the trapped state .",
    "an explicit recursion formula has been derived in our previous work @xcite in section 4 and in eq.a.12 . in the @xmath20 case however , the paths are simple , since only dimers or trimers are formed , leading to    @xmath170    which is the same as what was derived in eq.[w2 ] .",
    "the first assembly time @xmath171 starting from state @xmath165 is    @xmath172    here , the first term is the total exit time from the trap , given by the inverse of the detachment rate @xmath45 multiplied by the number of dimers .",

    ". however , the magnitude of this term would be much smaller than @xmath173 , since detachment rates are of order @xmath179 .",

    "we can generalize our estimate of the leading @xmath173 term for the first assembly time to larger values of @xmath7 via    @xmath185    where @xmath186 are trapped state configurations for @xmath46 .",

[ 1cluster ] ) . by using the symmetry properties of the associated matrix @xmath363 we can find the laplace transform of the first assembly time distribution @xmath364 @xcite in the @xmath214 limit    @xmath365    where @xmath366 is a unitary polynomial of degree @xmath235 , given by the following recurrence    @xmath367    thus , @xmath368 .",
    "note that the first assembly time is given by    @xmath369    by comparing eq.[eq : laplace ] with eq.[tlag ] we note that the term @xmath370 that appears in the above expansion for @xmath366 , corresponds to the quantity in the square brackets in eq.[tlag ] so that    @xmath371    and @xmath372 h.o.t .",
    "one can also calculate the variance of the first assembly time distribution to obtain    @xmath373    and similarly all other moments of the distribution .",
    "finally , we can also estimate the first assembly time distribution @xmath374 by considering the inverse laplace transform of eq.[eq : laplace ] , specifically by evaluating the dominant poles associated to @xmath366 . in the large @xmath45 limit , @xmath366 as evaluated via the recursion relations eqs.[distr ] can be approximated as    @xmath375    yielding the slowest decaying root @xmath376",
    "@xmath377    the above estimate allows us to write @xmath378 in the large @xmath45 limit as an exponential distribution with rate parameter @xmath376    @xmath379",
    "a more general hybrid approximation can be implemented by assuming that only cluster of size @xmath223 and smaller pre - equilibrate .",
    "we integrate eq.[master ] over all configurations but with @xmath381 fixed and obtain a reaction network for the remaining @xmath224 clusters :    @xmath382 { \\langle n_1 n_r | \\{n_{r+1}\\ } \\rangle_{\\rm eq } } & n_{r+1 } & \\xrightleftharpoons[q n_{r+2 } ] { \\langle n_1 | \\ { n_{r+1 } \\}\\rangle_{\\rm eq } n_{r+1 } } & n_{r+2 } & \\cdots & \\xrightarrow [ ] { \\langle n_1 | \\ { n_{r+1 } \\ } \\rangle_{\\rm eq } n_{n-1 } } & n_n , \\end{array } \\end{large}\\ ] ]      in the reaction chain ( [ jackson_network ] ) the last cluster size @xmath255 is treated as an absorbing state since we are only interested in the first assembly time , when @xmath275 . the question still remains of properly evaluating @xmath388 and @xmath389 .",
    "for @xmath198 it is reasonable to argue that that most of the mass is distributed among the fast clusters @xmath390 . indeed ,",
    "if we now assume that _ all _ the mass is contained in the fast cluster sizes , @xmath389 and @xmath391 may be obtained via a distribution of @xmath223 clusters with total mass @xmath392 .",
    "the rates in ( [ jackson_network ] ) become independent of @xmath393 , for @xmath394 .",
    "we can also drop the slow cluster size condition on the averaged quantities , and simply write @xmath395 and @xmath396 .",
    "the cluster network in ( [ jackson_network ] ) is a so - called linear jackson queueing network @xcite .",
    "entry of particles in queue @xmath397 occurs at rate @xmath398 , each of them moving independently according to the forward @xmath399 and backward @xmath45 transition rates . starting with no particles in the queue at @xmath53 , the time - dependent probability distribution for this queueing network is well known @xcite . in particular , the number of particles in the last queue follows a poisson distribution with mean      where @xmath401 is the probability that a single particle is in the @xmath402 queue at time @xmath28 after its entry in the system .",
    "because the last queue is absorbing , and from the definition of the first assembly time , the survival probability of our clustering process can be identified with the probability of having no particles in the last queue so that            as before , this technique requires an estimation of the first and second moments @xmath408 and @xmath409 from the equilibrium distribution for clusters up to size @xmath223 with total mass @xmath6 .",
    "a first crude way of approximating these asymptotic moments is to use the mean - field results      we can also derive moment equations for @xmath408 and @xmath411 directly from eq.[master ] . here ,",
    "due to non - linear couplings between cluster sizes , the lower order moments will necessarily be described in terms of higher order ones .",
    "for instance , to determine the first and second moments we are interested in , we would need an expression for the third moment . to close moment equations",
    ", one usually assumes that the probability distribution for all cluster sizes obeys a certain form  either gaussian , log - normal or negative binomial which are among the most standard .",
    "the third moment may then be written as a function of the first two , thus closing the system .",
    "the closed equations of the first two moments become non - linear and a numerical solver is typically used to solve them @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath284 has been extensively analyzed in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we follow the same approach , using a gaussian distribution to approximate higher moments , thus deriving a closed system of @xmath223 equations for @xmath412 and @xmath413 equations for @xmath414 , where @xmath415 .",
    "finally , note that the hybrid approach described above is based on the assumption that all mass is initially contained within the first @xmath223 clusters and are distributed according to the becker - dring equilibrium distribution .",
    "we expect this approach to be valid for moderate and large values of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , with @xmath214 in order for the production of small clusters to be faster than the production of larger ones . how to choose the optimal cutoff value @xmath223 is a delicate issue and depends on the specific parameters @xmath222 , although in general we find that all values of @xmath416 give qualitatively similar results .",
