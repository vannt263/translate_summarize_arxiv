    "recently , the atlas collaboration of the lhc experiment reported anomalies in their search for high - mass diboson ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 ) resonances with boson - tagged jets at the diboson invariant mass 2 tev  @xcite . @xmath10 and @xmath11 bosons resulting from high - mass resonance are highly boosted , so each boson s hadronic decay products are reconstructed as a single fat jet @xmath12 in this search .",
    "the reported local significances of anomalies are @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xmath14 , and @xmath16 @xmath14 for @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 channels , respectively .",
    "if we explain the atlas @xmath17 anomaly in the @xmath0 model , we need to introduce a narrow high - mass @xmath0 boson with @xmath20 tev , @xmath21 gev , and @xmath22 note here the above cross section is the best fit value . a @xmath0 particle with a little bit smaller production cross section may also be consistent with the atlas diboson anomaly .",
    "the cms collaboration also reported their results of search for high - mass diboson resonance in the same decay channel  @xcite . although the cms collaboration reported a small excess around 1.8 tev , at the resonance mass of 2 tev",
    ", cms only gives the upper limit on @xmath23 , @xmath24 fb .",
    "the atlas collaboration also reported their search for high - mass diboson resonance @xmath25 in the @xmath26 decay channel  @xcite . here",
    "@xmath27 stands for @xmath10 or @xmath11 .",
    "the atlas limit on @xmath23 in this decay channel is about @xmath28 for 2 tev narrow resonance @xmath25 .",
    "the limit ( [ eq : tension ] ) causes a tension with the best fit value of the atlas diboson anomaly @xmath29 fb .",
    "we use the value @xmath30 fb as a reference for our interpretation of the atlas diboson anomaly in this paper , though only 70% of the atlas diboson excess can be explained with this cross section .",
    "the cms collaboration recently reported their search limit on the @xmath0 production in the @xmath31 decay channel in ref.@xcite .",
    "although the cms collaboration found a small excess of event numbers around @xmath32tev , they found rather severe upper limit for @xmath20 tev resonance , i.e. , about @xmath33 fb . as we will see later , this upper limit causes a severer tension with the atlas diboson anomaly . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the cms collaboration reported their search result for high - mass resonance @xmath0 in the decay channel @xmath34 .",
    "again , they found an excess at @xmath35 tev .",
    "after the atlas collaboration reported the 2 tev diboson anomalies  @xcite , many studies of possible theoretical interpretations have appeared in the market  @xcite .",
    "one of the biggest questions raised in these interpretations is whether the atlas diboson anomaly at @xmath36 tev is related with the cms excesses at @xmath37 tev or not .",
    "given the situation where the jet mass resolutions of atlas and cms detectors are much better than 100 gev , it seems unlikely that the cms 1.8 tev excesses are directly related with the atlas 2 tev anomalies , however .",
    "if this is not so , the next theoretical challenge is to make viable models of @xmath0 explaining the atlas diboson anomalies without causing conflicts with the cms upper limit on the @xmath38 decay channel , @xmath39 fb at @xmath20 tev .",
    "this is a tough challenge , however , if we take the cms 7 fb upper limit seriously .",
    "the higgs boson is the @xmath40 partner of the would - be nambu - goldstone boson ( ngb ) in the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "the equivalence theorem of the longitudinal @xmath10 boson and the eaten would - be ngb amplitudes then suggests us a relation @xmath41 for sufficiently heavy @xmath0 .",
    "see , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite for a typical @xmath0 model satisfying this relation ( [ eq : equivalence ] ) .",
    "the relation ( [ eq : equivalence ] ) implies that the @xmath0 branching fraction to the @xmath42 mode is identical to the @xmath0 branching fraction to @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath43 .",
    "the cms 7 fb upper limit on the @xmath42 channel therefore gives an upper limit on @xmath44 fb .",
    "less than only a half of the atlas diboson anomaly excess @xmath45 fb can be explained !    although this tension may be explained by a statistical fluctuation at the present stage , it is tempting to consider scenarios free from the relation ( [ eq : equivalence ] ) . in this paper , we point out that the relation ( [ eq : equivalence ] ) is true only if the couplings of the 125 gev higgs boson with @xmath8 and @xmath9 are same as the sm predictions .",
    "we investigate the relation ( [ eq : equivalence ] ) from the viewpoint of the perturbative unitarity of the longitudinal @xmath10 and @xmath0 boson scattering amplitudes .",
    "we derive a set of unitarity sum rules among coupling strengths of @xmath0 and @xmath10 bosons , which should be satisfied in any perturbative model of @xmath0 .",
    "we then obtain a relation among the @xmath2 coupling , the @xmath3 coupling , and the @xmath46 coupling by using these unitarity sum rules .",
    "we find that , if the 125 gev higgs is a non - sm higgs boson , the relation ( [ eq : equivalence ] ) should be modified as @xmath47 here @xmath48 is defined as @xmath49 , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 being the @xmath3 coupling strength and its corresponding sm value , respectively . the atlas 2 tev diboson anomalies may be consistent with the cms limits on the @xmath42 decay channel , if we consider a model with @xmath52 .  .",
    "]    inspired by the unitarity sum rules and the custodial @xmath53 symmetry arguments , we then introduce a parametrization of @xmath0 and @xmath6 couplings , and survey the parameter space to find phenomenologically viable models consistent with the existing limits on the @xmath0 and @xmath6 particles .",
    "we then show that the three site moose model  @xcite , a linear sigma model generalization of the three site higgsless model  @xcite , can explain the parameter space consistent both with the atlas anomalies and with the existing limits on @xmath0 and @xmath6 .",
    "note that the three site higgsless model is a deconstruction@xcite version of the extra dimension higgsless model@xcite .",
    "the gauge symmetry breaking structure of the three site moose model thus resembles the structure of extra dimension models containing bulk weak gauge fields .",
