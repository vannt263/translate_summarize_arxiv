    "using a @xmath5 renormalization - group - improved iwasaki  @xcite gauge action , we study the chiral properties of hadrons on a @xmath1 lattice with the overlap fermion  @xcite and massive overlap operator  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the usual wilson fermion operator , except with a negative mass parameter @xmath10 in which @xmath11 ; we take @xmath12 in our calculation which corresponds to @xmath13 .",
    "we use the optimal partial fraction expansion with a 14th - order zolotarev approximation of the matrix sign function  @xcite ; the sign function approximated to better than @xmath14 parts in @xmath15 .",
    "as the conjugate - gradient inverter accommodates multi - mass  @xcite we obtain the quark propagator at @xmath16 masses including @xmath17 masses at or below the strange quark mass with less than 10% overhead .",
    "the renormalized pion decay constant is @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the unrenormalized quark mass , @xmath21 is the unrenormalized pseudoscalar decay constant , and @xmath22 is the amplitude of the two - point local - local correlator , @xmath23 .",
    "since @xmath24 is free of quenched chiral logs , and since we determine it quite precisely , we use @xmath24 to set the scale and obtain @xmath25 .    as a bonus",
    ", we obtain the axial - vector renormalization constant , @xmath26 , via the axial ward identity @xmath27 and the relations @xmath28 protected by the chiral symmetry of the overlap fermion .",
    "thus @xmath29 which is plotted in fig .  1 .     _",
    "vs_.  bare mass , @xmath30 . ]",
    "a covariant polynomial fit yields @xmath31 so @xmath32 and @xmath33 terms are small .",
    "vs_.  bare quark mass , @xmath30 . ]    our plot of @xmath34 in fig .  2 , with @xmath17 data points at or below the strange quark mass , dramatically reveals the presence of the quenched chiral log .",
    "we fit @xmath35 to the form  @xcite @xmath36\\right\\ } %    & + & b m_{0}^{2}a^{2 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] using a single multi - parameter ( weakly ) constrained fit ( the constraint lifts the degeneracy of the three - parameter fit ) .",
    "we obtain simultaneously ( the preliminary results ) @xmath3 and @xmath37 , which _ are quite stable _ against changing the window , [ @xmath38,@xmath39 , of masses in the fit provided ( a ) @xmath40 ; thereafter , @xmath41 monotonically decreases rapidly with increasing @xmath42 ( e.g.  @xmath43 for @xmath44 , @xmath45 for @xmath46 ) , and ( b ) @xmath47 ; adding a term @xmath48 to the fit formula increases the region of stability to @xmath49 .",
    "the pseudoscalar decay constant @xmath50 has similar behavior and fit results to @xmath34 .",
    "( this is automatic for overlap fermions since @xmath51 implies @xmath52 . )",
    "our value of @xmath41 is significantly higher than other recent values  @xcite most of which are well below the prediction of @xmath53 from the quenched @xmath54 loop ( using the witten - veneziano model of the @xmath54 mass ) in chiral perturbation theory ; however , we have exact chiral symmetry and , to date , use the largest spatial volume and probe the lightest pion masses . indeed , the effect of the chiral log makes the data points rise as the pion mass drops below @xmath55@xmath56 .",
    "notice that if one restricts the data to pion masses in the range of @xmath57@xmath46 to @xmath58 , then the curve can be well approximated by a constant within errors .",
    "equivalently , a plot of @xmath59 versus @xmath60 over this range would show no deviation from linearity , as is also seen in  @xcite .",
    "the effects of chiral logs are seen only at lower pion mass ; one is unlikely to see the effect at all without data below @xmath61 . with adequate spatial volume",
    ", the extraction of @xmath41 would give a low value without data below @xmath62 .",
    "our spatial lattice size is @xmath63 so finite - volume effects are expected to be small ; our lightest ( unrenormalized ) quark mass of @xmath64 corresponds to a pion of about @xmath65 . with a lattice scale of @xmath66 ( set from @xmath67 ) then @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "to renormalize our estimates of the quark mass , we follow  @xcite to determine the renormalization constants @xmath70 and thus @xmath71 : the value of the bare quark mass @xmath30 that reproduces a given fiducial pseudoscalar mass ( through @xmath72 , with @xmath73 for our lattice ) is obtained by interpolation of our data for the pion mass . from this",
    "we obtain @xmath74 at three values of quark mass ( the lowest two quark masses are roughly half - strange and strange ) .",
    "the operators and action are @xmath75 improved . for @xmath26",
    "we find small @xmath32 and @xmath33 dependence as well ; @xmath18 is well approximated ( to @xmath76 ) by a constant up through the strange mass region .",
    "thus we fit @xmath74 to a constant and obtain @xmath77 as a first approximation .",
    "our lightest pion mass is @xmath79 so we need nt extrapolate far to obtain @xmath30 at the physical pion mass ( fig .",
    "furthermore , exact chiral symmetry ( zero residual mass ) and the form of the fit function as determined by quenched chpt provide an end point at zero mass .",
    "last year s result  @xcite from a @xmath86 lattice with a lscher - weisz gauge action was @xmath87 .",
    "( the result quoted in the proceedings was an average of this number with an attempt to subtract out the effects of the chiral log . )",
    "a recent estimate  @xcite of the world average is @xmath88 .",
