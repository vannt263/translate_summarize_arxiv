    "spatially - indirect excitons in coupled quantum wells ( cqws ) present a model system for the study of a statistically degenerate bose gas in solid - state materials .",
    "this is due to the long optical lifetime of indirect excitons in comparison to their thermalization time which permits the creation of a cold and dense exciton gas @xcite .",
    "the exciton lifetime depends on the overlap of electron and hole wave functions . for indirect excitons ,",
    "this can be varied over several orders of magnitude @xcite by changing the electric field applied perpendicular to the growth direction .",
    "numerous studies on indirect excitons have focused on bose - einstein condensation @xcite , spatial pattern formations @xcite and spin transport phenomena @xcite .",
    "transport of indirect excitons has been studied extensively .",
    "their dipolar nature provides a probe of the density via a blue shift in the emission @xcite .",
    "it also facilitates transport of excitons over tens of micrometers @xcite as indirect excitons can screen the qw disorder potential due to interface roughness and defects @xcite .",
    "moreover , the dipole - orientation of the excitons provides the possibility to control transport via patterned electrodes positioned adjacent to the cqws @xcite .",
    "exciton transport has been studied in electrostatic traps @xcite , linear potential gradients @xcite and stationary @xcite and moving @xcite lattices .",
    "the high degree of control led to demonstrations of devices such as excitonic optical transistors @xcite .",
    "the properties of indirect excitons are also important for understanding a new breed of quasi - particles known as dipolaritons @xcite .",
    "such states are realized by embedding cqws inside a planar bragg - mirror microcavity @xcite . at the resonant tunneling condition ,",
    "the dipolariton is a superposition of a cavity photon , a spatially - direct and an indirect exciton and thus acquires a static dipole moment @xcite .",
    "dipolaritons have been suggested for observation of super radiant thz emission @xcite and continuous thz lasing @xcite .",
    "the application of magnetic fields to the cqw structure provides an extra degree of control . in exciton systems ,",
    "magnetic fields are used for trapping @xcite , control of superfluidity @xcite , tuning of exciton resonances @xcite and studying spin - splitting phenomena @xcite .",
    "the focus of this paper is the exciton effective mass enhancement due to a magnetic field @xcite . from a qualitative view point , this effect can be understood by considering a simple classical analogy . the lorentz force experienced by two oppositely charged particles that travel perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field acts to increase their relative separation .",
    "this comes at an energy cost as it is opposed by the coulomb attraction between the charges .",
    "the energy cost manifests itself as a resistance to change in momentum and thus an effective mass increase , dependent on the applied magnetic field strength .",
    "we consider the case where both electric and magnetic fields are normal to the qw plane . by finding a numerically exact solution of the exciton schrdinger equation",
    ", we perform a precise calculation of the mass enhancement .",
    "this description is an important ingredient for simulating exciton transport kinetics in a magnetic field where the exciton effective mass is a critical parameter @xcite .",
    "several works ( @xcite for example ) used variational methods to study indirect excitons in magnetic fields .",
    "however , these all lacked a calculation of the effective mass enhancement .",
    "a theoretical study of excitons in cqws with finite barrier and well width was done in @xcite , using two - dimensional ( 2d ) free electron - hole pair states in magnetic field as a basis for expansion of the exciton wave function .",
    "this approach is only well suited for treating high magnetic fields .",
    "also , a calculation of the exciton mass renormalization was absent .",
    "the mass renormalization in the 2d limit was calculated for excitons in single qws @xcite and indirect excitons in double qws @xcite . in those works ,",
    "the electron and hole wave functions in the qw growth direction were approximated by delta functions located at the qw positions .",
    "this corresponds to the limit of infinitely deep qws of zero width and is applicable only for the analysis of either purely direct or purely indirect excitons in the case of high electric field and strong qw confinement .",
    "it can not describe in any detail the smooth crossover between direct and indirect exciton states at intermediate electric fields .",
    "the recently developed rigorous multi - sub - level approach @xcite ( msla ) was previously used to calculate the cqw exciton states in perpendicular electric fields .",
    "the outcomes , which included a calculation of the dependence of the absorption spectrum and optical lifetime on electric field , were in good agreement with available experimental data .",
    "here , we use the msla to solve the exciton schrdinger equation in cqws with both electric and magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the qw plane .",
    "this method solves the exciton in - plane problem by a numerical discretization in real space and is thus equally well suited for both low and high magnetic fields .",
    "we have refined the msla to a highly accurate scheme by using numerov s algorithm @xcite , a fourth - order linear multistep method , for obtaining the energies and wave functions of the exciton states .",
    "it is found that the direct - to - indirect exciton crossover with varying electric and magnetic fields is an important ingredient in describing the magnetic field induced exciton effective mass renormalization , which was not captured in earlier works .",
    "we note that the msla can also be used to solve the exciton schrdinger equation coupled to maxwell s equations in order to model microcavity polaritons @xcite .",
    "however , modelling polaritons in magnetic fields is beyond the scope of this paper and forms the subject of future study .    in section [ model ] , we describe the schrdinger equation for a cqw exciton in the presence of electric and magnetic fields pointing in the growth direction and provide details of the msla .",
    "the perturbative approach used to obtain the electric and magnetic field dependence of the exciton effective mass is outlined in section [ massrenorm ] . in section",
    "[ results ] , we present calculations of exciton states and their associated properties for 8 - 4 - 8 nm gaas / algaas cqws . comparisons with 2d methods are made in section [ 2dcomparison ] and we show that our method converges to these in the limit of zero qw thickness .",
    "conclusions are made in section [ conclusions ] .",
    "to calculate the bound exciton states in a semiconductor nanostructure with external bias and magnetic field orientated normal to the qw plane , we consider the following hamiltonian : @xmath0 with @xmath1 here , @xmath2 are the electron and hole coordinates . for a multi - layered heterostructure , we adopt a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath3 with the @xmath4-axis along the qw growth direction .",

    "it can be shown @xcite that the solution to the equation @xmath14 has the following variable - separable form : @xmath15 with the center of mass motion of an exciton carrying 2d momentum @xmath16 described solely by @xmath17 \\cdot \\frac{{\\bf r}}{\\hbar}\\right\\ } , \\label{com2}\\ ] ] where @xmath18 and @xmath19 are the 2d in - plane center of mass and relative coordinates , respectively , @xmath20 is the in - plane exciton mass , and @xmath21 is the exciton magnetic quantum number .",

    "the schrdinger equation @xmath41 , in which @xmath42 is an exciton state in a cqw in finite electric and magnetic fields , is solved using the msla developed in @xcite .",
    "the principle of the method is that we expand the exciton wave function @xmath43 in ( [ com1 ] ) into the set of coulomb uncorrelated electron - hole pair states leading to @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the mapping @xmath46 leads to @xmath47 pair states formed from @xmath48 electron and @xmath49 hole states .",
    "we then calculate the radial components of the wave function @xmath50 , using a matrix generalization of the shooting method with numerov s method incorporated in the finite difference scheme .",
    "this solved the problem of the electron and hole in - plane and perpendicular motion mixed by the coulomb interaction , leading to the exciton quantization labeled here by the index @xmath51 .",

    "the outer limit @xmath54 of the wave functions is sufficiently large that all radial components asymptotically approach zero .",
    "the existence of such a limit is guaranteed for non - zero @xmath55 as the potential @xmath56 grows with @xmath57 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of @xmath58 where truncation of the solution range leads to a discretization of the unbound _ e - h _ continuum states .",
    "for the range of electric fields considered ( @xmath59 ) , it was previously found for @xmath58 that high accuracy is achieved using two electron and hole states ( @xmath60 ) @xcite .",

    "the oscillator strength , @xmath62 , is calculated from the overlap of the electron and hole wave functions , @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the dipole matrix element between the conduction and valence bands .",
    "for an exciton with a finite center of mass momentum @xmath65 , the hamiltonian ( [ mainhamiltonian ] ) is modified to @xmath66 where the perturbation @xmath67 is given by ( see [ appa ] ) @xmath68 and @xmath69 . to calculate the exciton mass renormalization in a magnetic field",
    ", we treat @xmath70 as a small parameter and use perturbation theory up to 2nd order",
    ". the 1st term of ( [ pert ] ) contributes to the exciton energy in 1st order only leading to the bare mass .",
    "the 2nd term , vanishing in 1st order , gives rise to a quadratic in @xmath70 correction in 2nd order and is thus responsible for the mass renormalization . neglecting non - parabolicity of the exciton band , which would be accounted for by treating the 2nd term in higher perturbation orders , we find the correction to the exciton energy proportional to @xmath71 and renormalized effective mass @xmath72 of exciton state @xmath73 in magnetic field : @xmath74 here the index @xmath75 counts over the eigenstates with the angular momenta @xmath76 which only contribute in 2nd order and which are calculated at given values of electric and magnetic field .",
    "details of the calculation of the matrix elements in ( [ effectivemass ] ) are given in [ appb ] .",
    "the advantage of our approach compared to some previous calculations of the exciton mass renormalization is that the perturbation is in @xmath70 only , allowing the @xmath55-field to be arbitrarily large .",
    "in contrast , the approach developed in @xcite used the magnetic field as a small parameter of the perturbation theory . consequently , the applicability of the latter is restricted to low magnetic field ( up to @xmath77 in the structure considered in this paper , see also the comparison in section [ 2dcomparison ] ) .",
    "another significant benefit of our approach is that the full 3d solution of the exciton schrdinger equation ( [ mainhamiltonian ] ) describes the inter - well coupling that is neglected by any 2d approximation @xcite .",
    "all results in this section refer to the structures studied in @xcite which consist of symmetric @xmath34 qws with barrier and well thickness of 4 nm and 8 nm , respectively .",
    "a complete list of parameters used in the calculations are given in table [ parameters ] .",
    "although we restrict the present analysis to two qws , the method is applicable to any number of qws since one can always obtain , either analytically or numerically , eigenstates of the single particle electron and hole hamiltonians in ( [ weh ] ) .",

    "the absorption spectrum converged for sufficiently large @xmath54 . in the present case , however , the magnetic field removes any need to consider the continuum states .",
    "the potential due to the magnetic field , ( [ bpotential ] ) , contains a term in @xmath57 which naturally closes the domain of the solutions .",

    "figure [ all](a ) shows the electric and magnetic field dependence of the in - plane bohr radius , @xmath87 .",
    "increasing the electric field increases @xmath88 due to a reduction in the _ e - h _ coulomb interaction which is caused by their increased separation in the @xmath4 direction .",
    "increasing the magnetic field has the reverse effect and shrinks the wave function in the qw plane .",
    "this shrinkage enhances the @xmath89-@xmath90 interaction which , in turn , leads to a more likely localization of the electron within the same qw as the hole and thus the ground state becomes a direct exciton .",

    "the value of @xmath55 at which this transition occurs increases with @xmath10 as a stronger confinement of the in - plane wave function is needed to sufficiently enhance the @xmath89-@xmath90 interaction and to induce the indirect - to - direct transition . in the indirect exciton regime at high electric field ( @xmath33 ) , the dipole moment corresponds to approximately the center - to - center distance of the qws which is 12 nm .",

    "@xmath93 is inversely proportional to the overlap of the electron and hole wave functions ( see figure [ zwfn ] ) .",
    "therefore , we find a decrease in @xmath93 with decreasing @xmath10 or increasing @xmath55 , consistent with the shrinking of the exciton radius shown in figures [ all](a ) and [ all](b ) .",
    "we note that in experiments @xcite , contrary to our results , the radiative lifetime of qw excitons is found to increase with increasing magnetic field .",
    "this , however , can be explained by considering the thermal distribution of excitons .",
    "only exciton states inside the light cone , i.e. those with in - plane momentum @xmath94 , can decay optically .",
    "the momentum @xmath95 corresponds to the intersection of the exciton and photon dispersions .",
    "the increase in the exciton effective mass ( see figure [ massfig ] ) causes a reduction in @xmath95 which reduces the fraction of excitons coupled to light .",
    "this increases the effective lifetime of the exciton gas  the quantity which is measured in experiments via the decay rate of the photoluminescence intensity @xcite .",
    "figure [ all](d ) shows the binding energy @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the calculated exciton ground state energy in magnetic field , @xmath98 is the energy of the unbound _ e - h _ pair state in zero magnetic field , and the last term takes into account the landau quantization energy of the free pair in magnetic field .",
    "the decrease in the size of the exciton , caused by either increasing @xmath55 or decreasing @xmath10 , leads to an enhancement of the @xmath89-@xmath90 interaction @xcite .",
    "this causes a tighter binding of the exciton and , therefore , an increase in @xmath99 .",
    "the effective exciton mass , @xmath72 , is calculated using second order perturbation theory ( see section [ massrenorm ] ) .",
    "figure [ massfig ] shows the electric and magnetic field dependence of the effective mass , @xmath100 , for the exciton ground state .",
    "we identify two limiting cases : firstly , for small electric fields ( @xmath101 ) where the exciton ground state is predominantly direct , there is a monotonic increase of the effective mass with increasing magnetic field .",
    "the rate of this increase is weakly dependent on the electric field .",
    "secondly , for electric fields greater than @xmath102 , there is an initial increase in the effective mass with increasing magnetic field , followed by an eventual decrease . at higher magnetic fields ,",
    "the effective mass asymptotically approaches the direct exciton effective mass .",

    "the curves for @xmath114kv / cm and 6kv fully describe the main trends seen in the full calculation and even demonstrate to some extent a quantitative agreement . for larger electric and magnetic fields",
    "this classical model fails because the spring constant @xmath110 becomes too small and the linearization of the restoring force used in the model no longer works .",
    "the classical model allows us to understand the exciton mass dependence in figure [ massfig ] .",
    "indeed , from the calculation presented in figure [ all ] , we find a greater @xmath110 for direct excitons than indirect excitons .",
    "qualitatively , this is because the indirect exciton has a weaker binding due to the increased spatial separation of the electron and hole .",
    "the difference in @xmath110 leads to a greater rate of effective mass increase with magnetic field for indirect excitons than for direct excitons .",
    "this explains the effective mass dependence in the low and high electric field limits in figure [ massfig ] . at intermediate fields ( @xmath115 ) , the initial increase and",
    "then decrease of the effective mass is a consequence of the ground state tending from an indirect to a direct exciton .",
    "this happens due to a shrinkage of the exciton wave function caused by the magnetic field . in turn , the _ e - h _ coulomb attraction is enhanced , making the direct state lower in energy than the indirect state .",
    "in order to verify our model , we make comparisons with previous results in which the limiting case of 2d excitons were treated . to make this comparison , we include just one electron and one hole state [ @xmath116 in ( [ solution ] ) ] taking the wave functions in the form @xmath117 and @xmath118 , where @xmath119 is the dirac delta function and @xmath120 is the nominal distance between the qws .",

    "in particular , our calculations demonstrate a non - monotonous behavior of the exciton effective mass in magnetic field which is understood in terms of the direct - to - indirect exciton transition and also illustrated in a simple classical model .",
    "our results for the quantum well width tending to zero are in good agreement with different 2d approaches available in the literature . however , in contrast to the 2d approaches , the full msla captures the direct - to - indirect transitions of the exciton ground state for varying electric and magnetic fields which are necessary for a full and detailed description of the system .",
