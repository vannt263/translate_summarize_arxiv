    "two quite different aspects of the studies of qcd thermodynamics on the lattice gained most attention in the heavy ion community during recent years  studies of the qcd phase diagram at non - zero baryon chemical potential and the analysis of the influence of a thermal heat bath of ( quarks and ) gluons on basic properties of hadrons , e.g. their masses and widths . in this review",
    "we will focus on the latter aspect of lattice studies but will also briefly discuss studies of the qcd phase diagram in this introduction .",
    "there has been considerable progress in extending studies of the qcd phase diagram to small but non - zero values of the baryon chemical potential @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "this led to a first analysis of the equation of state at non - vanishing baryon number density @xcite and estimates for the location of the chiral critical point ( second order phase transition ) @xcite at which the transition to the high temperature phase of qcd turns from a rapid crossover to a first order phase transition .",
    "recent calculations suggest a critical value @xmath4  mev @xcite .",
    "this is much larger than the estimate for the baryon chemical potential which characterizes the chemical freeze - out of hadron resonances at rhic , @xmath5  mev @xcite and suggests that the transition at @xmath6 as well as in the almost baryon free region produced at mid - rapidity at rhic is characterized by a rapid crossover from a hadronic resonance gas to the quark gluon plasma .",
    "the analysis of the equation of state for @xmath7 shows , on the one hand , that thermodynamics in the low temperature phase of qcd is well approximated by thermal properties of a hadronic resonance gas @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it also shows that the strong increase of baryon number fluctuations , which for @xmath8 and @xmath9 is consistent with the rise of baryon number fluctuations in a resonance gas , is suppressed once the system enters the plasma phase @xcite .",
    "the resulting pronounced peak in the baryon number fluctuations indicates the proximity of the chiral critical point in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "although it has been suggested since a long time that these kind of fluctuations should result also in visible event by event fluctuations in heavy ion collisions , it remains to be seen to what extent the experimentally observed increase in the @xmath10 ratio @xcite and its fluctuation @xcite can be attributed to the qcd phase transition .",
    "confinement and chiral symmetry breaking are main characteristics of qcd which explain the basic properties of the hadron spectrum in the vacuum .",
    "qualitative features like the existence of a light goldstone particle , the pion , and the excitation spectrum of heavy quark bound states can be understood through the mere existence of a non - vanishing , spontaneously generated chiral condensate @xmath11 , and the linearly rising heavy quark potential with a non - vanishing string tension @xmath12 , respectively .",
    "quantitative properties of the spectrum depend , however , on the actual value and @xmath13-dependence of @xmath14 and @xmath12 as well as on other properties of qcd like the running of the coupling with temperature or the generation of a thermal , debye screening mass .",
    "it recently has been pointed out that despite of chiral symmetry restoration and deconfinement it is well conceivable that a complicated quasi - particle structure may persist in the qcd plasma phase at temperatures @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "in fact , the non - perturbative structure of the plasma phase for @xmath16 is already evident from the strong deviation of bulk thermodynamic quantities , e.g. the pressure , from their perturbative form @xcite .",
    "the influence of a thermal heat bath on hadron properties immediately becomes evident when one compares euclidean time ( @xmath17 ) correlation functions of mesons in different quantum number channels . at low temperature chiral symmetry breaking and",
    "the breaking of the axial @xmath18 symmetry lead to a splitting of hadronic states , which would be degenerate otherwise and would then also have identical correlation functions . in we",
    "show pseudo - scalar ( @xmath19 ) and scalar ( @xmath20 ) meson correlation functions in a gluonic heat bath ( quenched qcd ) at temperatures below ( left ) and above ( right ) the deconfinement transition temperature ; @xmath21 with @xmath22 denoting a hadron current with the appropriate quantum numbers of the hadronic channel @xmath23",
    ". the spectrum in the pseudo - scalar and scalar channels differs at low temperature because of the explicit breaking of the axial @xmath18 symmetry which consequently leads to quite different correlation functions in ( left ) .",
    "the almost perfect degeneracy of both correlation functions above @xmath24 , however , suggests that this symmetry is effectively restored in the deconfined phase of qcd ( ( right ) ) .",
    "the hadron correlation functions , @xmath25 , are directly related to spectral functions @xmath26 which contain all the information on thermal modifications of the hadron spectrum in certain channels of hadron quantum numbers , @xmath23 , @xmath27 lattice studies of in - medium properties of hadrons greatly advanced in their predictive power through the exploitation of the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite .",
    "this allows the reconstruction of @xmath28 at non - zero temperature for light as well as heavy quark bound states .",
    "we will concentrate here on the heavy quark sector and , in particular , will discuss in how far potential model calculations , which generally led to an early dissociation of heavy quark bound states @xcite can be made consistent with recent studies of charmonium spectral functions in the high temperature phase of qcd @xcite , which find charmonium bound states even at @xmath29 .",
    "this will require to reconsider the relation between heavy quark free energies calculated on the lattice and temperature dependent potentials used in potential model calculations .",
    "we will start with a discussion of this problem in the next section and present recent results on charmonium spectral functions in section 3 .",
    "the original idea of charmonium suppression as a signature for plasma formation in heavy ion collisions @xcite relies on the occurrence of fundamental changes in the heavy quark potential ( vanishing string tension , debye screening ) in the high temperature phase of qcd . while there is no doubt that this does happen in qcd it was clear right from the beginning of studies of @xmath0-suppression in potential models @xcite that a quantitative determination of dissociation temperatures depends on the detailed structure of the heavy quark potential at high temperature .",
    "information on the latter can be extracted from an analysis of heavy quark free energies @xcite calculated on the lattice which describe the change in free energy of a thermal medium due to the presence of static quark and anti - quark sources , @xmath30 here the static sources are represented by polyakov loops @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and @xmath33 denote the qcd partition functions in presence or absence of these sources , respectively .",
    "quite often @xmath34 itself has been interpreted as the heavy quark potential at finite temperature and as such has been used in potential model calculations .",
    "this , however , ignores the fact that aside from modifying the energy of the thermal heat bath the external sources also change the entropy of the system .",
    "the change of energy and entropy will depend on temperature as well as the separation of the @xmath35-pair , @xmath36 the relative importance of energy and entropy contributions to the free energy at different @xmath35 separations becomes evident after a proper renormalization of polyakov loops @xcite .",
    "when renormalizing @xmath31 by matching @xmath37 at short distances to the zero temperature heavy quark potential @xcite one readily finds that at short distances the temperature dependence of @xmath38 is weak .",
    "this indicates that after subtraction of a simple statistical entropy term ( @xmath39 ) the short distance part of the free energy reflects the change in energy due to the presence of static quark anti - quark sources .",
    "this , however , is not sufficient to obtain the ( potential ) energy at all distances . at large distances",
    "a strong temperature dependence remains even after the subtraction of @xmath40 .",
    "in fact , @xmath41 and @xmath34 will approach @xmath42 for @xmath43 ( see a ) . as seen in b",
    ", @xmath44 decreases almost linearly in @xmath13 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath45 .",
    "this shows that the free energies contain a substantial entropy contribution at large distances while the energy contribution almost vanishes , which according to is reflected by the weak temperature dependence of @xmath46 .",
    "this complicated @xmath47-dependent entropy contribution makes a direct use of free energies in potential models questionable .",
    "a further obstacle for a direct use of lattice calculations of heavy quark free energies in potential models arises because at non zero temperature @xmath48 does not directly give the singlet free energy from which one could determine the singlet energy or potential used in phenomenological approaches .",
    "the free energy defined through the polyakov loop correlation function in gives a weighted average over singlet and octet contributions @xcite . at non - zero temperature the definition of a singlet free energy requires gauge fixing . at present",
    "most studies of the singlet free energy have been performed in coulomb gauge , where the singlet free energy is given by , @xmath49 some results for @xmath50 are shown in . as expected from the discussion given above it is clear that at short distances free energy and energy will coincide while at large distances the asymptotic value of the heavy quark energy will be larger than the corresponding free energy value as the entropy contribution has been removed .",
    "this suggests that heavy quark bound states could survive in the qcd plasma up to temperatures significantly higher than those estimated previously in potential model calculations , which have been based on input obtained from calculations of the heavy quark free energy . to quantify these statements",
    "it is necessary to extent the analysis discussed here in the context of quenched qcd also to the case of qcd with a realistic light quark spectrum .",
    "it should have become clear from the discussion in the previous section that an analysis of thermal properties of heavy quark bound states in terms of potential models and probably even the determination of singlet potentials from lattice calculations will require additional phenomenological consideration . on the other hand ,",
    "as pointed out in the introduction , an ab - initio approach to thermal hadron properties through lattice calculations exists and is based on the calculation of thermal hadron correlation functions , @xmath25 . as indicated in @xmath25",
    "is related to the spectral functions @xmath26 . however , an inversion of this integral equation is generally not possible because lattice calculations only yield information on @xmath25 at a finite , discrete set of euclidean time steps , @xmath51 with @xmath52 , with @xmath53 denoting the temporal extent of the lattice .",
    "it is , however , possible to determine the _ most probable _ spectral function which describes the calculated data set @xmath54 and respects known constraints on @xmath28 ( positivity , asymptotic behavior , ... ) .",
    "this can be achieved using a bayesian data analysis , e.g. the maximum entropy method ( mem ) @xcite . in the context of qcd calculations",
    "this has been introduced in @xcite .",
    "a first feeling for the influence of a thermal heat bath on the structure of correlation functions and the size of medium modifications of a thermal spectral function can be obtained by comparing directly the numerically calculated correlation functions at temperature @xmath13 with a correlation function , @xmath55 , constructed from the spectral function calculated at a smaller ( zero ) temperature , @xmath56 with @xmath57 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath58 in this way the trivial temperature dependence of the integration kernel is taken care of and any remaining discrepancies between the reconstructed correlation function and the actually calculated correlation function at temperature @xmath13 can be attributed to changes in the spectral function . some results for charmonium correlation functions are shown in @xcite .    the ratio of correlation functions shown in would equal unity , if the spectral functions would not depend on temperature .",
    "however , as can be seen the correlation functions for @xmath59-state charmonia ( left ) show strong thermal modifications already at temperatures slightly above @xmath24 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath60-state correlators ( right ) show only little modifications up to @xmath61 .",
    "in fact , no temperature dependence is visible in the pseudo - scalar channel ( @xmath1 ) up to @xmath62 while modifications in the vector channel ( @xmath0 ) are of the order of @xmath63 at this temperature .",
    "the reconstruction of charmonium spectral functions has been performed using technically different approaches , e.g. using point - like @xcite or smeared @xcite hadron sources on isotropic @xcite or anisotropic @xcite lattice with standard wilson fermion @xcite or improved wilson fermion @xcite actions .",
    "the different calculations agree to the extent that no significant modification of @xmath60-state spectral functions is observed up to @xmath64 , _",
    "i.e. _ the @xmath0 survives as a narrow bound state with unchanged mass up to this temperature .",
    "this is shown in the upper part of .",
    "current lattice calculations .",
    "in fact , only the first , low energy peak in the spectral functions shown in is physical and insensitive to changes of the lattice cut - off .",
    "the other two peaks have been shown to be lattice artifacts arising from  wilson doublers ",
    "] differ , however , on the structure of spectral functions for larger temperatures ( lower part of ) .",
    "while it is concluded in @xcite that the @xmath0 resonance disappears quite abruptly at @xmath65 the analysis of @xcite suggests that the resonance disappears gradually ; a resonance peak with reduced strength is still visible at @xmath66 and finally disappears completely at @xmath67 .    to get control over the detailed pattern of dissolution of the heavy quark resonances clearly requires more refined studies .",
    "it also should be noted that so far all existing lattice studies have been performed in the quenched approximation .",
    "although virtual quark loops are not expected to modify the qualitative picture obtained from these calculations in the heavy quark sector of qcd one clearly has to understand their influence on a quantitative level .",
    "( 10.0,8.0 ) ( 4.3,5.11 ) ( 4.2,2.77 ) ( 4.3,1.41 ) ( -1.7,-1.0 ) ( -0.7,2.8 ) ( -0.7,6.3 ) ( -1.45,7.1 )",
    "studies of spectral functions of charmonium states suggest that the @xmath68 ground states , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , exist as well localized resonances with masses essentially equal to their vacuum values at least up to temperatures @xmath69 . whether these states disappear abruptly at higher temperatures or whether their contribution to the spectral functions gradually weakens requires further studies .",
    "we also discussed the reanalysis of heavy quark free energies and showed that these can not directly be identified with the potential energy of a static quark anti - quark pair .",
    "the elimination of entropy contributions to the free energy leads to ( potential ) energies which generally have a larger dissociation energy for a @xmath68-pair . taking this into account in potential model calculations , which in the past suggested a rather early dissociation of heavy quark bound states ,",
    "can well lead to dissociation temperatures consistent with results obtained from the analysis of spectral functions .",
    "i would like to thank all my collaborators at bielefeld , bnl and swansea that contributed to the various research projects that led to many of the results discussed here .",
    "in particular , i would like to thank saumen datta , peter petreczky and felix zantow for their critical comments on this write - up .",
