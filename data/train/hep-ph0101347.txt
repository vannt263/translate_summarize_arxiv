    "the standard model ( sm ) is built upon the fact that neutrinos have no right - handed components and are massless .",
    "thus , lepton flavors are conserved .",
    "so far , experiments have not yet observed any lepton - flavor violation ( lfv ) .",
    "nevertheless , the evidence of small neutrino masses ( implied from oscillation analyses of solar and atmospheric neutrino data @xcite ) implies a small amount of lfv .",
    "many new physics models beyond the sm predict a certain amount of lfv , in relation to neutrino mass generation or otherwise .",
    "an important criterion for a viable model is that it should give an acceptable neutrino mass spectrum while staying within the experimental limits of lfv . among the latter processes ,",
    "the radiative decay of muon , @xmath3 , provides the most stringent bound @xcite .",
    "the current limit is @xcite @xmath4 a proposal is underway , which can improve this limit by three orders of magnitude@xcite .    in the lagrangian of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , apart from the soft supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking part , there are no lepton - flavor violating terms that would induce lepton - flavor changing processes such as @xmath3 .",
    "it is , however , well known that soft susy breaking parameters can have all types of flavor - changing terms .",
    "limits on such parameters from @xmath3 have been extensively studied @xcite . on the other hand , flavor - changing soft susy breaking parameters",
    "are often expected to be suppressed by the source of susy breaking of a more fundamental theory .",
    "a particularly interesting example is the gauge mediation models @xcite .",
    "models with ",
    "right - handed neutrinos \" provide other interesting alternatives with potentially large lfv@xcite .",
    "it is no surprise that issues of lfv are often tied up with the generation of neutrino masses . within the mssm ,",
    "apart from the soft terms , both lfv and neutrino masses are indeed forbidden by an _",
    "ad hoc _ discrete symmetry  r parity .",
    "note that the soft terms by themselves still conserve total lepton number , and hence do not generate neutrino masses .    in the supersymmetric standard model without r - parity imposed , there is however another important source of lfv . a major part of this comes simply from the r - parity violating ( rpv ) terms in the superpotential .",
    "we would like to emphasize that the latter is independent of susy breaking and mediation mechanisms .",
    "in fact , the only theoretical means to suppress the flavor - changing effects from rpv couplings would be a generic flavor theory , or some _ ad hoc _ symmetries such as r - parity itself .",
    "hence , it is important to obtain all the available experimental bounds on the rpv couplings .",
    "we show that the experimental limit on the radiative decay of muon , @xmath3 , provides one of the most stringent constraints on the rpv couplings .",
    "an improvement of a few orders of magnitude in the experiment may , in fact , discover susy as well as the lfv , if the model under consideration does explain the nature .",
    "we first explain a new contribution to the @xmath1-slepton mass mixings involving the bilinear @xmath5 and trilinear @xmath6 rpv superpotential parameters .",
    "such an important interplay between the bilinear and trilinear couplings was first discussed in refs.@xcite in the context of neutrino mass .",
    "there is also an analogous contribution to the @xmath1-squark mixings , with implications to 1-loop neutrino masses@xcite and fermion electric and magnetic dipole moments @xcite .",
    "with nonzero @xmath7 and @xmath8 , the ( off - diagonal ) @xmath1-mixing involving the @xmath9 generations is proportional to @xmath10 . with no particular arguments or theories to enforce @xmath8 to be diagonal in the last two indices , the lfv proportional to @xmath11 turns out to be quite natural . the combination @xmath11 conserves the overall lepton number but violates lepton flavor .",
    "there is another similar contribution to slepton masses in the @xmath0 mixing part in the form of @xmath12 .",
    "so far as we know , the implication of such terms in the slepton mass matrix is discussed here for the first time .",
    "the structure also illustrates very clearly the basics of the lfv structure , which comes into @xmath3 , for example , in other ways too , as we will see below .    in this article , we presented a systematic analysis of the @xmath3 emphasizing the new rpv contributions .",
    "we work within the framework of the single - vev parametrization ( svp)@xcite , which is an optimal choice of flavor basis that helps to guarantee a consistent and unambiguous treatment of all kinds of admissible rpv couplings and to maintain a simple structure for rpv effects on tree - level mass matrices for all states including scalars and fermions@xcite .",
    "note that under the svp , the above - mentioned terms with lfv represent the full rpv contribution to the corresponding entries in the ( charged ) slepton mass matrix . obviously , the @xmath12 combinations contribute equally to the neutral scalar (  sneutrino \" ) masses .",
    "there are other interesting rpv contributions that mix the sleptons with the other scalars (  higgses \" ) . among the latter",
    "are the interesting contributions from the soft @xmath13 parameters .",
    "they come into @xmath3 at a different level .",
    "the present work differs from previous ones on the topic @xcite in a few important ways .",
    "ours is based on the most generic theory of susy without r - parity , _",
    "i.e. _ , no assumptions on the form of r - parity violation , while most of the previous authors worked in various limited rpv scenarios .",
    "the only exception is the recent paper of ref.@xcite , which basically works under the same framework as ours .",
    "they include the @xmath1-slepton mixing contribution , following the suggestion of ref.@xcite , where the closely related subject of fermion electric dipole moments is discussed",
    ". however , the results presented are not as complete and systematic as our treatment here .",
    "in particular , there is no discussion of the lfv from the bilinear rpv parameters only .",
    "in addition , their bounds on @xmath11 have a @xmath14 dependence , which we disagree with .",
    "other than that , the above new rpv contributions have not been studied before .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we give the general formulas in the basis of mass eigenstates .",
    "the focus is on the @xmath15 amplitude from 1-loop diagrams without colored intermediate states .",
    "though the small deviations of the external physical charged lepton mass eigenstates ( @xmath16 s ) from the electroweak states @xmath17 s are neglected , full attention is given to such deviations for the particles running in the loop when we analyze the diagrams .",
    "likewise , exact mass eigenstates are always used in the numerical calculations of the 1-loop amplitudes .",
    "the formulas can be easily adapted for the radiative @xmath18 decay with simple substitutions .",
    "guided by the formulas and results from our exact numerical calculation , we analyze in detail the important pieces of 1-loop contributions in sec .",
    "numerical results are presented and discussed in sec .",
    "iv ; after which we conclude the article in sec .",
    "v. for the readers who are more interested in the major features of the result , rather than the sophisticated details on how each rpv parameter comes into play in the process , sec .",
    "iii can simply be skipped .",
    "the section also serves as an analytical confirmation of the correctness of the numerical results , for the more serious readers .",
    "here we calculate the decay rate of @xmath3 through colorless 1-loop diagrams using exact mass eigenstates for particles appearing inside the loop .",
    "however , as stated above , for the external legs to the loop , we use only electroweak states ( @xmath19 s ) .",
    "each of the latter has a minimal deviation from the corresponding @xmath20- or @xmath21-handed component of the physical charged lepton states as a result of the corresponding small rpv @xmath5 terms@xcite .",
    "we work in the framework of the generic supersymmetric standard model@xcite , known as susy without r - parity . here",
    "one could simply give up the notion of r - parity ; however , the latter terminology is convenient for comparison with the more popular mssm , as well as other limited studies of r - parity violations .",
    "we adopt exactly the same notation as in refs.@xcite , to which readers are referred for more details .",
    "let us summarize some of the useful notation here , starting from the generic superpotential @xmath22 +   \\frac{1}{2}\\ , \\lambda_{ijk}^{\\!\\prime\\prime }    \\hat{u}_i^{\\scriptscriptstyle c } \\hat{d}_j^{\\scriptscriptstyle c }    \\hat{d}_k^{\\scriptscriptstyle c }   \\;\\ ] ] ( with @xmath23 going from @xmath24 to @xmath25 , @xmath26 from 1 to 3 , and @xmath27 ) .",
    "the essential features of the svp adopted include @xmath28 and the identification of @xmath29 as @xmath30 ; related to that is the fact that @xmath31 is the diagonal  leptonic yukawa \" couplings , while @xmath32 for @xmath33 .",

    "it is obvious that in order to have a contribution to @xmath115 , a term must reduce @xmath113 and increase @xmath112 by exactly one unit while leaving @xmath114 unchanged .",

    "the aim is to understand the exact role played by each of the rpv parameters in the process , and the strength of each contribution .",

    "take @xmath116 , for example , among the three terms in eq.([a2l ] ) , the one with @xmath117 corresponds to the diagrams with the chirality flip on the internal fermion line .",
    "hence , the diagrams with the two chargino states ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath118 ) would potentially dominate over the other diagrams with external chirality - flipping mass insertion ( @xmath119 or @xmath120 ) .",
    "we first look at the contributions with a ( @xmath121 ) structure . taking only one @xmath97-coupling vertex",
    ", one can then take the gauge coupling term ( first term ) from @xmath122 .",

    "here we have dropped the pseudoscalar part just for simplicity in this discussion .",
    "this is exactly valid when there is no mixings between scalars and pseudoscalars .",
    "however , we find it more transparent in illustrating the basic features .",
    "if the loop function @xmath123 could be factored out from the double summation , we would have a @xmath124 summation over fermions and a @xmath125 summation over ( real ) scalars .",
    "however , the fermionic sum gives exactly the @xmath126@xmath127 mass term , which is zero .",
    "this is well illustrated by the loop diagram with electroweak state notation , as given in fig .  1 .",
    "hence , one expects a gim - like cancellation mechanism , here violated only to the extent that @xmath123 is not universal .",
    "the violation is , however , quite substantial , as illustrated in the similar case of quark electric dipole moments@xcite and by our exact numerical calculation here . the case of degenerate charginos is an obvious exception , which , however , needs too large a complex phase for @xmath128 to be phenomenologically viable .",
    "a similar situation goes with the scalar sum  @xmath129 by unitarity .",

    ", we see that @xmath143 in particular , is very likely to be predominantly diagonal .",
    "off - diagonal elements in the @xmath75 matrix then measure the small mixings .",
    "the largest terms among the different @xmath89 s are then given by @xmath144 or @xmath145 with a suppression factor of magnitude @xmath146 .",
    "this result is an example of the @xmath20-slepton flavor mixing from the coupling of the form @xmath147 mentioned in the introduction  something that is also useful for our discussion below .",

    "this is the most intuitive contribution involving the combination of parameters that we mentioned in the introduction .",
    "numerically , this contribution is , typically , only similar to other neutralino - like terms with one gauge coupling vertex , and hence smaller than the dominating chargino - like term discussed above .",
    "the reason here is that the larger gauge coupling effect is offset by the suppression factor coming from the @xmath1-mixing .",

    "the mixing of the corresponding complex scalars , however , involves a 32- entry of the @xmath166 matrix . from the result given in the sec .",
    "iia , we see that the mixing does have a @xmath165 .",
    "but it comes in the combination @xmath167 the latter is , by the tadpole equation ( [ tp3 ] ) , @xmath168 . detailed analysis of the full scalar mass matrix , with the first - order mixings among the higgs states , does not change the @xmath168 dependence of the result .",
    "hence , the lfv structure here is given by the rpv parameter combination @xmath169 , which is related to the @xmath170 combination through the tadpole equation .",
    "given in terms of @xmath171 , the contribution has an explicit @xmath141 dependence . in general , one expects this contribution to be of comparable magnitude to the previous one .",
    "the last contribution we want to discuss here is the one with two @xmath97 couplings . extracting the part similar to expression ( [ 1st ] ) , we have [ maj ] _ m^ _",

    "right \" signs ( or with @xmath75 , as in the case of the first gauge coupling term ) would give identical contributions from the two parts ; while the  wrong \" signs would give an exact cancellation instead .",
    "to put it in another way , a majorana - like scalar mass insertion along the scalar line is needed to have the contribution nonzero , as depicted in fig .",

    "an illustration of the majorana - like scalar mass terms is shown explicitly in fig .",

    "an interesting point , at least from the theoretical point of view , is that the contribution could have a different flavor structure from the more familiar two-@xmath97 loop diagrams with the chirality flip on the external muon line@xcite , and a @xmath178 instead of @xmath179 dependence too .",
    "for instance , we could have a new contribution from the @xmath180 combination .",
    "finally , we want to remark that the remaining contributions with internal chirality flip can be analyzed again by using the extended flavor structure with the  leptonic yukawa coupling \" @xmath96 identified as @xmath99 , as discussed above .",

    "contributions from the terms with the chirality flip on the external muon line is expected to be suppressed by a @xmath162 ( @xmath187 ) factor .",
    "however , we have seen that apart from the @xmath188-type combination , other combinations of rpv parameters that come into the diagrams with an internal chirality flip do have extra suppressions .",
    "hence , it is still of interest to see if there are important terms with an external chirality flip that are comparable to those discussed in the previous section .",
    "therefore , we mainly look for terms depending on only two rpv parameters without further extra suppressions , apart from the one dictated by the chirality flip .    for the chargino - like diagrams , for instance ,",
    "our candidates here are from the @xmath189 part of @xmath105 and the @xmath190 part of @xmath191 .",

    "it is easy to see then that it is impossible to choose a combination of @xmath243 such that it does not cause further changes in any of the lepton - flavor numbers , unless more rpv parameters are involved .",
    "a term of the latter case has been discussed analytically [ _ cf .",
    "_ expression ( [ maj ] ) ] . the same situation holds for @xmath260 .",
    "we will not further investigate such contributions here .",
    "we have discussed above the implication of the tadpole equations relating the @xmath13 s to the @xmath5 s .",
    "our numerical strategy isolates terms explicitly proportional to a @xmath13 or a @xmath5 .",
    "here we discuss the contributions involving the @xmath13 s .",
    "first , there are combinations @xmath220 and @xmath221 .",
    "for @xmath220 an illustrative contribution has been discussed analytically in the previous section [ _ cf .",
    "_ expressions ( [ blam ] ) and ( [ blam2 ] ) ] .",
    "the bounds obtained on these combinations are shown in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "contours of @xmath262 in the real @xmath263 plane are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . understanding the result analytically is more complicated here .",
    "our analysis does suggest more than one factor of yukawa suppression , hence the weakness of the bound obtained .",
    "numerically , the part with external chirality flip from a @xmath189 contribution [ _ cf . _ expression ( [ blam2 ] ) ] can dominate over the part with the chirality flip inside the loop [ _ cf .",
    "_ expression ( [ blam ] ) ] depending on @xmath264 .",
    "the overall bound looks stronger than the analytical estimate . this is to be explained by the larger loop function @xmath265 with the much lighter muon propagator compared with that of a chargino , and the @xmath216 dependence .",
    "however , the relation between a @xmath266 and a @xmath7 and the weakness of the present result compared to the @xmath267 or @xmath268 result suggests that the @xmath269- or @xmath270- type contribution is really of less significance .",
    "next , we have the @xmath217 combination . recall that according to our strategy ,",
    "this is probed with @xmath241 and @xmath271 set to zero .",
    "it clearly has a  muon yukawa \" suppression [ _ cf .",
    "_ expression ( [ 2murl2 ] ) ] .",
    "numerically , the bound is similar to that on @xmath205 .",
    "the number shown in table  [ table2 ] actually looks better than the corresponding @xmath205 number .",
    "however , @xmath272 comes in with a @xmath216 dependence .",
    "therefore , @xmath273 should be compared with @xmath274 , hence explaining the difference .",
    "again , we give contours of @xmath234 in the real @xmath275 plane , in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] .",
    "the analogous contribution of the type coming from @xmath218 has a  electron yukawa \" suppression .",
    "numerically , it is confirmed to be much smaller .",
    "likewise , we find no important contribution from an explicit @xmath219 combination .",
    "in fact , one obviously can not make a simple @xmath3 diagram with a @xmath171 and a @xmath271 rpv insertions .      in this section",
    ", we illustrate the effects of varying the input parameters on the bounds , using @xmath276 and @xmath277 as examples .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ table3 ] .",
    "basically , the effects of varying the mass parameters ( @xmath278 ) reflect on what particles are inside the loop of the dominant diagrams . in the case of @xmath279 ,",
    "the dominant diagram involves mainly the @xmath280 , while the @xmath277 case involves the mixing between @xmath280 and @xmath281 .",
    "therefore , varying @xmath203 does not have much effect on the bounds while varying the corresponding entries in @xmath202 changes the bounds significantly .",
    "obviously , a large ( relevant ) scalar mass suppresses the @xmath3 amplitude and thus weakens the bounds [ see parts ( iii ) and ( iv ) ] .",
    "increasing @xmath128 and @xmath282 essentially increases the chargino and neutralino masses [ see parts ( i ) and ( ii ) ] . here , the variation of the bound is more complicated . for illustration",
    ", we show more details of the @xmath128 variations in part ( i ) . taking @xmath279 as an example ,",
    "the bound is most stringent for small @xmath156 .",
    "however , for negative @xmath128 , apart from the general weakening trend as @xmath156 increases , there is an extra structure in the dominating chargino contribution , namely , there is a dip at @xmath283 , where it essentially vanishes .",
    "this is a special feature of the type of rpv contribution also observed in the similar contribution to neutron electric dipole moment@xcite . for the relatively large value of @xmath141 , used here , however , this is already well inside the large @xmath156 region where the pure gauge loop contribution becomes dominant .",
    "the latter case generally happens when the bino mass @xmath157 is small relative to @xmath156 .",
    "note that the pure gauge loop contribution is independent of @xmath128 .",
    "apart from the dip mentioned , the dominant chargino contribution does decrease with increasing @xmath156 , as shown in column  1 of table  [ table3 ] .",
    "as for the @xmath277 case , the variation of the bound with @xmath156 is more complicated . unlike the previous case , the contribution has , analytically , an explicit chargino mass dependence [ as shown by comparing expression ( [ 2murl1 ] ) with expression ( [ 1st+ ] ) ] .",
    "hence , we do not expect a simple weakening of the result as @xmath156 increases .",
    "another important issue here is that there is more than one important piece of contribution of this type in most regions of the parameter space .",
    "for example , if we stick to setting @xmath284 as we do to obtain the numbers given in column  2 of table  [ table3 ] , we still have the pieces corresponding to fig .  2 and fig .",
    "4a [ _ cf .",
    "_ expressions ( [ 2murl1 ] ) and ( [ ext12 ] ) ] in interference with one another . besides , at very large @xmath156 ( and relatively small @xmath285 ) the pure gauge - gauge term of the neutralino - like contribution is increasing and dominates over the chargino - like contribution .",
    "in addition , we have shown in column  3 of the table  [ table3 ] , an interesting case with @xmath286 instead .",
    "then the @xmath287- and @xmath169-type contributions exist simultaneously . as given in eq.([tp3 ] ) , we then have @xmath288 , and the contribution of @xmath169 type such as that given by expression ( [ 2murl2 ] ) comes along and interferes with that of the @xmath192 .",
    "our result in table  [ table2 ] suggests that the @xmath169 type contribution is smaller than the @xmath192 type but are of the same order ; a destructive interference of the two parts then weakens the overall result .",
    "note that our analytical discussions in the previous section [ _ cf .",
    "_ expressions ( [ 2murl1 ] ) and ( [ 2murl2 ] ) ] indicate that the terms come in with a different sign . with larger @xmath156 ,",
    "the bounds shown in column  3 of the table are much weaker , because of a stronger cancellation as the @xmath169 term increases .",
    "this is mainly a result of the increase in the @xmath272 value ( for fixed @xmath241 ) , however , the contribution from the term has more complicated dependence on the @xmath156 .",
    "similarly , the same increase in cancellation with larger @xmath289 , as shown in the table can be understood from comparing the two terms .",
    "the results shown in column  3 , hence , further illustrate the importance of the tadpole condition given by eq.([tp3 ] ) emphasized throughout the paper .",
    "finally , we comment briefly on the @xmath141 dependence of the results , also illustrated in part ( v ) of table  [ table3 ] . from the table",
    "we can see that varying @xmath141 has only a little effect on @xmath279 but a rather significant effect on @xmath277 .",
    "the lack of sensitivity to @xmath141 in the former case has been suggested in our analytical discussion [ _ cf",
    ". _ expression ( [ 1st+ ] ) ] and further confirmed over the range of the @xmath141 value . in the latter case",
    ", the numerical result shows that the bound is strengthened by a factor of @xmath290 .",
    "this simply illustrates the @xmath291 dependence of the yukawa coupling @xmath162 .",
    "in this paper , we have performed a comprehensive study on the radiative decay of muon ( @xmath201 ) in the framework of the generic supersymmetric standard model ( without r parity ) .",
    "we have identified a few combinations of a minimal number of rpv couplings contributing to the decay . among them",
    "the most interesting are @xmath292 and @xmath293 .",
    "the upper bound on the combinations obtained from the experimental limit on @xmath294 is @xmath295 which is as stringent as the ones that can be obtained from the constraint of sub - ev neutrino masses .",
    "note that different combinations of rpv parameters are involved in the generation of neutrino masses though .",
    "furthermore , our result , in contrast to a similar result given in ref.@xcite , has little sensitivity to @xmath141 .",
    "another combination , @xmath296 , contributing to @xmath3 involves the @xmath0-slepton mixing .",
    "this contribution is identified for the first time .",
    "the upper bound on the combination obtained from the experimental limit on @xmath294 could be important , especially in the region of large @xmath216 .",
    "we have also discussed the related role of the soft susy breaking @xmath13 parameters in the process .",
    "\\(i ) the combinations @xmath297 and @xmath298 participate directly in the @xmath1-slepton mixings , while @xmath299 participate in the @xmath0-slepton mixings .",
    "the combinations also highlight the major @xmath82 contributions . under our formulation ( svp ) , the only rpv soft susy",
    "breaking parameters that contribute to ( tree - level ) slepton masses are the @xmath13 s and the @xmath79 s .",
    "\\(ii ) in relation to the rpv parameters ( under svp ) , the tadpole equations say that @xmath300 for each @xmath301 are not independent .",
    "this fact is often overlooked in the literature . in our study , we single out the contribution from @xmath5 or @xmath302 with a matching nonzero @xmath79 .",
    "we have also illustrated a case with @xmath286 , and thus combined the effects of both @xmath303 and @xmath302 .",
    "this case shows that there could be strong cancellations between them .",
    "hence , the overall contribution from the bilinear rpv parameters only is tied up with how the tadpole equations among @xmath300 s are chosen to be satisfied .",
