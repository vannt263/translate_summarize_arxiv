    "@xcite we construct a differentially rotating hmns with mass @xmath2 and angular momentum @xmath3 .",
    "this hmns is similar to one found in a bns merger simulation  @xcite .",
    "a small seed poloidal magnetic field is introduced into the hmns as described in shibata et al .",
    "these calculations are the first in general relativity to self - consistently generate a candidate grb central engine ( i.e. , a rotating bh surrounded by a magnetized torus ) from non - singular initial data .",
    "in figure  1 , we show snapshots of the meridional density contours , velocity vectors , and poloidal magnetic field lines at the initial time and at a late time .",
    "the differential rotation of the hmns winds up a toroidal magnetic field , which then begins to transport angular momentum from the inner to the outer regions of the star ( magnetic braking ) , inducing quasistationary contraction of the hmns  @xcite . after the toroidal field growth saturates ,",
    "the evolution is dominated by the mri  @xcite , which leads to turbulence , thus contributing to the angular momentum transport .",
    "the star eventually collapses to a bh , while material with high enough specific angular momentum remains in an accretion torus .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath4 gradually decreases and eventually settles down to @xmath5s , giving an accretion timescale of @xmath6 .    to explore the properties of the torus",
    ", we calculate the surface density @xmath7 and the typical thermal energy per nucleon , @xmath8 .",
    "we find @xmath9  mev / nucleon , or equivalently , @xmath10 k. because of its high temperature , the torus radiates strongly in thermal neutrinos  @xcite .",
    "however , the opacity inside the torus is approximately @xmath11  @xmath12  @xmath13 .",
    "the optical depth is then estimated as @xmath14 , so that the neutrinos are effectively trapped  @xcite . here , @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "this regime of accretion has been described as a neutrino - dominated accretion flow ( ndaf )  @xcite .",
    "we note that the properties of the torus are not specific to the chosen initial data .",
    "for example , we consider the model labeled star  a in duez et al .",
    "this is also an hmns model which collapses to a bh surrounded by a hot accretion torus under the influence of magnetic fields .",
    "however , star  a has simple @xmath1-law eos ( not a hybrid eos ) and has a different rotation profile and compactness . in this case",
    ", we find that the disk has @xmath17  mev / nucleon , which gives an optical depth of about 70 .",
    "thus , the evolution of star  a also produces a hyperaccreting ndaf .",
    "returning to the hybrid eos hmns model , we estimate the neutrino luminosity in the optically - thick diffusion limit .",
    "@xcite we obtain @xmath18 , which is comparable to the neutrino eddington luminosity  @xcite . a model for the neutrino emission in a similar flow environment with comparable @xmath19 gives for the luminosity due to @xmath20 annihilation @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "since the lifetime of the torus is @xmath22 ms , the total energy , @xmath23 , may be sufficient to power sgrbs as long as the emission is somewhat beamed  @xcite .",
    "our numerical results , combined with accretion and jet models  @xcite , thus suggest that magnetized hmns collapse is a promising candidate for the central engine of sgrbs .    _",
