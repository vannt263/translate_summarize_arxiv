    "cosmic acceleration is mainly inferred through geometrical measures of the expansion history , most notably from the dimming of high redshift supernovae @xcite . in order to be certain of this interpretation ,",

    "an alternative mechanism has been proposed for the dimming of supernovae @xcite . here",
    "photons are converted into an unseen particle during transit .",
    "this mechanism is based on a generic interaction between the photon and a pseudo - scalar field .",
    "other cosmological consequences of this pseudo - scalar ( p - p ) coupling include faraday - like rotations , spontaneous generation of polarization , and primordial magnetic fields generation @xcite .    mediated by an external magnetic field",
    ", this coupling also produces the conversion that dims supernovae .",
    "this mechanism is similar to that exploited by axion direct detection experiments @xcite but in the reverse direction .",
    "previous works examining the viability of this alternative dimming mechanism have largely focused on constraints from the observed achromaticity of the dimming @xcite .    in this paper , we reconsider this alternate mechanism in light of recent cosmological measurements .",
    "first , we show that there exists large regions in the parameter space that both satisfy current luminosity distance measurements and avoid achromaticity constraints by saturating the conversion .",
    "hence exclusion of this alternate explanation solely through supernovae data is difficult .    on the other hand , cosmological probes of acceleration that do not involve luminosity distances are immune to dimming effects .",
    "specifically , expansion history constraints based on angular diameter distances from the measurement of standard rulers can be used to directly test the dimming hypothesis .",
    "the acoustic oscillations set by the photon - baryon fluid before recombination imprints the sound horizon as a standard ruler in both the cosmic microwave background and galaxy power spectra .",
    "we combine measurements from wmap @xcite which give the angular diameter distance to recombination with the recent detection of baryon oscillations in the sdss lrg galaxy survey @xcite which provides the distance ratio between the galaxies and the cmb .",
    "our result exclude a non - accelerating species of dark energy at the 4@xmath1 level even allowing for the possibility of photon conversion .",
    "furthermore , within the 95% confidence limits there exists separate solutions with no dimming and strong dimming of supernovae both of which require cosmic acceleration .",
    "these possibilities can be distinguished in the future with better constraints from the acoustic oscillations .    in an appendix",
    ", we also consider spectral constraints from cobe firas on the dimming of the cmb itself .",
    "these constraints , which are more robust than and equally powerful compared to cmb anisotropy constraints @xcite , are useful for eliminating astrophysically disfavored regions of the parameter space that involve large external magnetic fields with a short coherence length .",
