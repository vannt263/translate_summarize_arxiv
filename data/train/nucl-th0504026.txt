    "the main theoretical framework to understand the behavior of the density of states of a fermionic system has been , and still is , the independent particle model . in the degenerate gas approximation , when the excitation energy of the gas is much smaller than the fermi energy @xmath1 , the excitation spectrum relies on the properties of the single  particle ( sp ) spectrum near @xmath1 . in most theoretical calculations only the average sp density of states , @xmath2 , is taken into account . for a system of @xmath3 noninteracting fermions moving in a mean  field potential , the number of excited states of the many  body ( mb ) system contained in a small energy window @xmath4 at energy @xmath0 , @xmath5 , is @xcite @xmath6 here @xmath0 is measured with respect to the ground state energy of the gas . for a given potential ,",
    "@xmath2 is in general a function of @xmath3 .",
    "besides the condition @xmath7 , this expression assumes that the excitation energy is large compared to the sp mean level spacing @xmath8 . for simplicity , and because our aim here is not to compare with experimental data , we ignore angular momentum conservation , isospin , etc .",
    "after bethe s work , more accurate calculations of @xmath9 were made @xcite .",
    "schematic shell corrections related to a periodic fluctuation of the sp density were computed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , introducing the so  called back - shifted bethe formula .",
    "several phenomenological modifications of eq.([bethe ] ) have been proposed to match the experimental results .",
    "these models take into account , for example , shell effects , pairing corrections and residual interactions @xcite , introducing a multitude of coexisting phenomenological parameterizations .",
    "the present status of the understanding do not allow to draw a clear theoretical picture of the functional dependence of @xmath9 with @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "our purpose is , within a sp picture , to further develop the theoretical analysis to include several important effects that are missing in eq.([bethe ] ) .",
    "this presentation is based on the work reported in @xcite .",
    "there are different ways in which eq.([bethe ] ) can be improved . as mentioned before , it is the leading term of an expansion valid for a large number of particles @xmath3 and for high energies @xmath0 ( compared to the sp mean level spacing @xmath10 ) .",
    "for instance , assuming the gas is confined by a woods  saxon like mean field potential , then @xmath11 where we used the approximation @xmath12 mev .",
    "this expression of @xmath2 is the leading order term of an expansion in decreasing powers of @xmath3 .",
    "corrections to it can be incorporated by considering lower order terms in the weyl series , that includes surface corrections , curvature corrections , etc @xcite .",
    "a similar expansion in decreasing powers of @xmath3 holds for the energy or mass of the nucleus ( the liquid drop formula ) .",
    "as is well known , the coefficient of each term in the expansion of the energy obtained from a fermi gas is not correct , since the renormalization due to interactions is out of the range of the model .",
    "similarly , the coefficient @xmath13 in eq.([afermi ] ) does not give a good description of the average trend of the experimental data obtained from neutron resonances , which is closer to @xmath14 ( cf fig.1 ) .",
    "although of great interest , we will not discuss these @xmath3 corrections and their renormalization due to interactions , but concentrate on two other corrections that are within the scope of a noninteracting model . the first one ( next section ) leads to smooth lower order terms in the excitation energy @xmath0 .",
    "the second type of corrections incorporates oscillatory terms in @xmath3 and @xmath0 .",
    "these oscillations , superimposed to the smooth @xmath15 trend mentioned above , are clearly visible in the experimental data shown in fig.1 .",
    "appearing in the fermi gas level density formula as a function of the mass number @xmath3 ( taken from ref.@xcite ) . ]",
    "the only property of the sp spectrum in eq.([bethe ] ) is the average density of levels @xmath2 .",
    "this approximation treats the sp spectrum as a continuum , and ignores the influence in the many  body density of states of the discreteness of the spectrum and of the exact position of the sp levels .",
    "one step beyond , that incorporates the discreteness but ignores the fluctuations , is to consider a locally perfectly regular sp spectrum ( 1d harmonic oscillator ) , given by the sp energies @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is an arbitrary integer , and @xmath18 is the distance between neighboring levels .",
    "the fermi gas model consists of @xmath3 noninteracting fermions that occupy the equidistant levels , with occupation number 0 or 1 . in the ground state the particles",
    "fill the lowest @xmath3 sp states .",
    "we restrict the analysis to the approximation @xmath7 , in which the number of excited particles is small compared to the total number @xmath3 , and effects due to a finite number of particles can be ignored . in the excited states particles",
    "occupy sp levels above @xmath1 , thus creating holes in the fermi sea .",
    "the possible excited energies , measured with respect to the ground state energy , are @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is an arbitrary positive integer .",
    "the excitation energies are thus trivial .",
    "the nontrivial information comes from the degeneracy of each of theses energies , since there are many different many ",
    "body configurations with the same excitation energy .",
    "the problem then is how to compute the degeneracy of each excited state of energy @xmath21 .",
    "( next five columns ) of a gas of noninteracting fermions in a perfectly regular sp spectrum .",
    "each excited state is identify with a decomposition of the excitation energy 4 as a sum of integers ( bottom of each column ) . ]",
    "the solution is obtained by realizing that the problem we are facing is exactly equivalent to a well known problem in mathematics , i.e. in how many different ways an integer can be decomposed as a sum of integers ( partitions of an integer , @xmath22 ) .",
    "we will simply provide here a graphical illustration of this equivalence ( fig.2 ) .",
    "consider for example the case @xmath23 , the argument easily generalizes to any @xmath20 .",
    "@xmath23 can be decomposed as a sum of integers in 5 different ways ( and thus @xmath24 ) : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "as fig.2 shows , each of these decompositions is in a one - to - one correspondence with one of the possible excited states of the fermi gas of total energy @xmath30 .",
    "the ground state is shown on the left column . in the second column from the left four particles",
    "have been pushed one level up , hence the equivalence with @xmath25 ( other mappings may be used as well ) . in the third column the upper particle was pushed up by two , the next two by one . etc .",
    "as has been emphasized many times , there is also a ( trivial ) one  to ",
    "one correspondence between the partitions of an integer and the excited states of a gas of noninteracting bosons in a one  dimensional harmonic oscillator potential . in this case",
    "each integer in the decomposition of the excitation energy indicates the level occupied by one of the excited particles .",
    "the partition of an integer grows very fast with @xmath20 : it is 5 for @xmath23 , whereas @xmath31 ( this number was computed by hand by p. macmahon in 1918 ) .",
    "the generating function of @xmath22 was obtained in 1753 by l. euler .",
    "an explicit expression for @xmath22 came much later , under the form of an asymptotic ( exact ) formula ( initially obtained by hardy and ramanujan @xcite , improved and made rigorous later on by rademacher @xcite ) . to facilitate the comparison with more general approaches , we express the result in terms of @xmath32 , where here @xmath33 is the inverse of the exact spacing between neighboring levels .",
    "the first terms of the expansion are given by , @xmath34 we emphasize with the notation @xmath35 that this is the many",
    " body density of states for a fermi gas in a 1d harmonic oscillator spectrum .",
    "as expected , the first two terms of this equation reproduce bethe s formula .",
    "however , eq.([shr2 ] ) goes much further : it is a truncation of the _ exact _ asymptotic expansion of the density of states , whose precision can be improved by adding further terms .",
    "notice that all the terms in eq.([shr2 ] ) are smooth functions of the excitation energy @xmath0 .",
    "it is natural to ask about the relevance of eq.([shr2 ] ) in realistic systems , where the true sp spectrum consists of discrete energy levels arranged , in most cases , with no particular order .",
    "equation ( [ shr2 ] ) clearly goes beyond bethe s result , since it describes the exact behavior of the many ",
    "body density of states of a gas of particles that occupy a discrete , perfectly regular arrangement of sp levels .",
    "it is therefore not unreasonable to expect that the result is valid for an arbitrary spectrum having the same average density @xmath2 , and that the effects of the fluctuations of the sp energy levels with respect to a perfectly regular arrangement come on top of it .",
    "although we do not have for the moment an explicit proof of this statement , numerical simulations to be presented below seem to confirm this hypothesis .",
    "the exact dependence of @xmath9 on @xmath3 and @xmath0 is sensitive to the detailed arrangement of the sp energy levels around the fermi energy .",
    "strong deviations with respect to a regular spacing , with possible degeneracies , may be produced by the presence of symmetries of the confining self  consistent potential .",
    "these deviations induce , in turn , oscillations in the thermodynamic functions of the gas .",
    "shell effects are therefore due to deviations ( or bunching ) of the sp levels with respect to a perfectly regular spectrum .",
    "the degeneracies of the electronic levels of an atom produced by the rotational symmetry are an extreme manifestation of level bunching . in general , in systems that have other symmetries , or have no symmetries at all , there will still be level bunching , but its importance will typically be minor . therefore , depending on the presence or absence of symmetries , the shell effects may be more or less important .",
    "the level bunching , and more generally the fluctuations of the sp energy levels , are thus a very general phenomenon .",
    "the theories that describe those fluctuations make a neat distinction between systems with different underlying classical dynamics ( e.g. , regular or chaotic ) .",
    "our understanding of these fluctuations and of their connections with the regular or chaotic nature of the sp motion has greatly increased in the last decades .",
    "for a recent review see @xcite .",
    "oscillations in the many  body density of states of nuclei are clearly visible in the experimental data available from neutron resonances as a function of the mass number @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter @xmath36 extracted from the data , plotted in fig.1 , shows oscillations around an average growth ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "the effective description of the oscillations through the parameter @xmath36 is an artifact of the analysis , since the fermi gas model relates @xmath36 to @xmath2 , a smooth function .",
    "as we will see below , the theoretical analysis leads to oscillatory corrections that enter as an additional term in the exponent of @xmath9 , and thus can not in general be interpreted as an effective @xmath36 .",
    "there are two distinct and important scales to describe the sp fluctuations . the first one , the smallest one , is the mean spacing between sp energy levels @xmath10 .",
    "the fluctuations of the sp energy levels on that scale have been shown to be , for a large class of systems , _",
    "universal_. their statistical properties are described by uncorrelated sequences for integrable systems , and by random matrix theory in chaotic ones .",
    "the second relevant energy scale is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is of the order of the time of flight across the system ( a precise definition will be given below ) .",
    "for @xmath3 large , the ratio @xmath39 is much larger than one ( for instance , @xmath40 in a three dimensional cavity ) .",
    "in contrast to the fluctuations on scales @xmath10 , the fluctuations on scales @xmath41 are long range modulations of the sp spectrum whose structure and amplitude are system specific . there is therefore no universality on this scale .    for an arbitrary sp spectrum",
    "the computation of the density of excited states of a fermionic system is a difficult combinatorial problem for which no exact solution is known .",
    "what we are seeking here are the variations of the mb density of states due to fluctuations of the sp spectrum with respect to a perfectly ordered spectrum , described in the previous section .",
    "an explicit formula that includes these effects has been obtained recently @xcite .",
    "the result , obtained from a saddle point approximation of an inverse laplace transform of the mb density , takes the form @xcite",
    "@xmath42 \\right\\ } \\ .\\ ] ] the function @xmath43 is the fluctuating part of the energy of the gas at chemical potential @xmath44 and temperature @xmath45 , defined as follows .",

    "the fluctuating part of the energy is defined as @xmath52^{-1 } \\ .\\ ] ]    in eq .",
    "( [ rhodef ] ) the arguments of @xmath53 are functions of @xmath3 and @xmath0 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "these two functions are determined by inversion of the equations @xmath56 the function @xmath57^{-1}$ ] is the particle number .",
    "we are ignoring here ( small ) variations of the chemical potential with temperature .",
    "to lowest order , in which only the average behavior of the energy and of the particle number is taken into account , the second equation in ( [ spc ] ) leads to the usual relation between temperature and excitation energy @xmath58 and @xmath44 is simply a function of @xmath3 , @xmath59 .",
    "for instance , for a fermi gas in a 3d cavity of volume @xmath60 and particle mass @xmath20 , @xmath61    equation ( [ rhodef ] ) shows that , superimposed to the smooth growth of the density described by eq.([bethe ] ) , there are oscillatory corrections in the exponent of the density of states .",
    "these corrections are directly related to energy fluctuations of the system .",
    "the oscillatory nature of the new corrections is clearly displayed through a semiclassical theory , that expresses the quantum properties of the fermion gas in terms of classical solutions of the sp equations of motion . in this approach @xmath43 is written as a sum over the classical periodic orbits of the mean  field potential @xcite @xmath62 each orbit is characterized by its action @xmath63 , stability amplitude @xmath64 , and maslov index @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath66 is the period of the periodic orbit , and @xmath67 is a temperature factor that introduces the time scale @xmath68 conjugate to the temperature .",
    "this expression describes the departures of @xmath69 with respect to its mean behavior due to the fluctuations of the sp spectrum .",
    "the behavior of @xmath53 strongly depends on whether @xmath44 or @xmath45 ( or @xmath3 or @xmath0 ) are varied .",
    "a temperature variation modifies the prefactors of the summands in @xmath53 ( through the function @xmath70 ) , and therefore produces gentle variations of the fluctuating part in the exponent of the density of states @xmath71 \\ .\\ ] ] in contrast , @xmath64 , @xmath66 and @xmath63 depend on @xmath44 ( and therefore on @xmath3 ) . for large values of @xmath44 , @xmath72 and the dominant variation with the particle number ( or any other parameter that modifies the actions ) comes from the argument of the cosine function in @xmath53 .",
    "rapid oscillations of @xmath73 are therefore generically expected when the number of particles is varied .",

    "the spectrum of periods @xmath66 has no upper bound .",
    "it has , however , a lower bound , given by the period @xmath38 of the shortest periodic orbit . since @xmath38 is usually the smallest characteristic time scale in the system , it determines the largest energy scale @xmath37 in which modulations ( bunching ) of the sp energy levels occur    if the classical periodic orbits are known in a particular system , the corrections can be computed explicitly . the periodic ",
    "orbit sum is dominated by the short orbits , and rapidly gives a good approximation of the result . to illustrate our findings",
    "we have tested some of the predictions by a direct numerical counting of the mb density of states in a particular system .",

    "we compute the mb density of states at three different temperatures , measured in units of @xmath78 the theoretical curve is computed according to the expression @xmath79 where @xmath73 is calculated from the periodic orbits of the rectangle .",
    "if the smooth corrections to the density of eq.([shr2 ] ) are not included , and only the result of bethe is used , a systematic deviation is observed in the average behavior of @xmath9 between theory and numerics . although the theoretical analysis of ref.@xcite does not include those corrections , the numerical results seem to indicate that their validity goes beyond the simple 1d harmonic oscillator spectrum .",
    "notice the extremely good accuracy of eq.([hro ] ) , either for the average value of the density as well as for the fluctuations .",
    "notice also that the typical size of the fluctuations can be quite important ( it is of the order of the average for the lowest excitation energy computed ) .",
    "equation ( [ hro ] ) decomposes the exponent of the density of states into a smooth part ( given by the hardy  ramanujan result ) plus oscillatory contribution , @xmath80 , associated in a semiclassical theory to a sum over periodic orbits .",
    "@xmath80 relates the shell corrections in the mb density of states to the fluctuations of the energy of the gas .",
    "@xmath53 depends on temperature only through the function @xmath70 ( cf eq.([grandosc ] ) ) .",
    "the effect of this function is to exponentially suppress the contribution of periodic orbits whose period @xmath81 @xcite . since there is no suppression at @xmath82 ( because @xmath83 ) , only orbits whose period @xmath84 contribute to the difference @xmath85 . at temperatures such that @xmath86 , the term @xmath43 becomes exponentially small , and only @xmath87 remains .",
    "the shell correction @xmath80 therefore decays as @xmath88 at @xmath89 .",
    "this decay contrasts with the more common exponential damping observed in other thermodynamic quantities @xcite .",
    "a clearer picture of how the fluctuations behave may be obtained through a statistical analysis .",
    "the most simple property of the fluctuations is @xmath90 , where the brackets denote an average over a suitable chemical potential ( or particle number ) window .",
    "this result is valid only to first order in the expansion leading to eq.([rhodef ] ) @xcite ; it can be shown that higher order terms contribute to a non  zero average .",
    "the next non ",
    "trivial statistical property is the variance @xmath91 , that may be computed using eq.([grandosc ] ) .",

    "it describes system  dependent features for @xmath95 of the order of @xmath96 , while it is believed to be universal for @xmath97 .",

    "taking into account the basic properties of @xmath93 , in * chaotic systems * three different regimes for @xmath91 as a function of temperature are found @xcite ( remember the relation ( [ tq ] ) between @xmath45 and @xmath0 ) :    * low temperatures @xmath98 . in this regime @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the value at @xmath101 of the constant @xmath102 ^ 2 \\",

    "the situation is different in * integrable systems * , where only two regimes are found . at low temperatures the result is identical to that of chaotic systems .",
    "the linear growth at low temperatures is thus totally universal and independent of the system .",
    "the difference is that in integrable systems the growth extends up to much higher temperatures , @xmath109 , without saturation . at that temperature",

    "is therefore reached at @xmath109 , and its typical size is much larger than in chaotic systems . at high temperatures @xmath89",
    "the decay is almost identical to that of chaotic systems ( the coefficient 8 is replaced by a 12 ) .",
    "a schematic representation of the temperature dependence of the variance of the fluctuations for chaotic and integrable systems is given in fig.4 .    .",
    "]    it has been shown @xcite that @xmath43 is dominated , at any @xmath45 , by the shortest classical periodic orbits .",
    "in contrast , the difference @xmath110 depends on orbits whose period @xmath84 . for temperatures",
    "@xmath111 the statistical properties of these orbits are universal , and correspondingly the probability distribution function of @xmath73 is expected to be universal , in the sense that at a given temperature it should only depend on the nature of the underlying classical dynamics ( regular or chaotic ) , and the symmetries of the system .",
    "this statement is supported by the fact that in the limit @xmath112 , @xmath113 .",
    "the probability distribution of the latter quantity was studied in ref.@xcite ; it was shown that it coincides at low temperatures with that obtained from a poisson spectrum for integrable systems and from a random matrix spectrum for chaotic ones .",
    "this confirms the universality of the distribution at low temperatures .",
    "as the temperature is raised , the universality of the probability distribution of @xmath73 will be lost for temperatures of the order or greater than @xmath41 , where system specific features ( i.e. , short periodic orbits ) are revealed . in this respect ,",
    "the decay ( [ htr ] ) is only indicative .",
    "its exact form depends on the details of the short periodic orbits spectrum , treated here only through a rough approximation .",
    "two improvements with respect to bethe s formula of @xmath9 have been discussed .",
    "the first one incorporates the discreteness of the sp spectrum by considering a set of equidistant sp states ( 1d harmonic oscillator ) .",
    "the exact many  body density of states is obtained by mapping the problem to the computation of the number of decompositions of an integer as a sum of integers .",
    "the exact formula adds finite@xmath0 corrections to the asymptotic result .",
    "although a proof is missing , numerical simulations suggest that the range of validity of this result extends beyond the 1d harmonic oscillator spectrum to any spectrum , in the sense that it describes with good accuracy the smooth part of the growth of @xmath9 in systems with an arbitrary sp spectrum ( cf fig.3 ) .    beyond the smooth behavior , the second improvement concerns the fluctuations or shell effects in @xmath9 .",
    "in a semiclassical theory , each periodic orbit has been shown to contribute to @xmath114 with a fluctuating term as a function of the number of particles @xmath3 , of wavelength @xmath115 at low excitation energies long orbits contribute to the fluctuations while short ones are exponentially suppressed , leading to wild oscillations and universality of their statistical properties .",
    "as the temperature increases , the situation is reversed , long orbits are exponentially suppressed while short orbits come into play . at @xmath116 ,",
    "oscillations of wavelength of order @xmath117 are predicted .",
    "these oscillations are clearly visible , with the correct wavelength , in fig.3 . with the raise of the short periodic orbits as @xmath45 increases",
    ", the universality of the statistical properties of the fluctuations disappears for @xmath45 of the order or higher than @xmath118 .    concerning the typical size of the oscillations , a nontrivial dependence as a function of excitation energy ( or temperature ) was found .",
    "the results are summarized in fig.4 .",
    "the behavior is quite different in chaotic and integrable systems . at low temperatures the variance grows linearly with @xmath45 in all cases .",
    "however , a plateau is rapidly reached at @xmath119 in chaotic systems , whereas the amplitude of the fluctuations continue to grow in regular ones . at @xmath116",
    "the differences reaches its maximum amplitude , where the variance in regular systems is @xmath76 times larger than in chaotic ones ( remember , moreover , that @xmath120 in a three dimensional cavity , so that the difference increases with an increasing number of particles ) . at this point",
    "the situation is similar to what was found for the ratio of the variance of the fluctuations of the nuclear mass due to regular and chaotic motion @xcite . at @xmath89",
    "the variance decreases as @xmath121 for both types of dynamics .",
