    "quantum mechanical systems with topological excitations are , in principle , ideally qualified for quantum information processing as the state of the topological sector is not accessible to local operators , and hence local perturbations can not lead to decoherence .",
    "the best studied example of topologically ordered states are fractional quantum hall ( qh ) systems , where braiding of quasiparticles changes the ground state wave function . while in conventional qh states with odd denominator filling fraction only the phase of the wave function",
    "is changed by quasiparticle ( qp ) braids , the more recently discovered quantum hall state at filling fraction 5/2 is expected to support non - abelian qps , whose braiding corresponds to transformations in a degenerate ground state manifold .",
    "@xcite the ground state degeneracy can be used to store information in the form of quantum bits , with one qubit for a pair of qps , and quantum gate operations may be performed by the braiding of qps . in principle , the read - out of quantum bits is possible by means of interference experiments .",
    "@xcite    one possible device for the readout of a topological quantum bit is the fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "it consists of two narrow constrictions in a hall bar which act as quantum point contacts and allow backscattering between counter - propagating edges modes .",
    "interference between partial waves backscattered at the first and at the second quantum point contact is sensitive to the phase acquired during a trip around the interferometer cell .",
    "proposals for using a fabry - perot interferometer for the readout of a topological quantum bit rely on the fact that there is a relative change of the interference phase by @xmath2 depending on the state of the qubit enclosed in the cell .",
    "@xcite    the 5/2 quantum hall state can be described as a p - wave superconductor of composite fermions .",
    "@xcite in this picture , qp excitations are vortices accompanied by an electric charge @xmath3 .",
    "these vortices have a zero energy bound state at their core , which is described by a majorana degree of freedom .",
    "the majorana operators associated with two such vortices can be combined into a complex fermion and constitute a two level system suitable for quantum information processing .",
    "the state of this two level system can be changed by moving a third qp around one partner of the pair .",
    "@xcite depending on the occupancy of this two level system , the interference phase obtained by a partial wave that encircles the two level system is predicted to change by @xmath2 . more generally , the influence of bulk particles localized inside the interference cell on the fabry - perot interference phase can be used to provide evidence for the non - abelian character of 5/2-qp excitations .    as an example",
    ", we may consider the phase change when voltage is applied to an ideal side gate , which is able to vary the area @xmath4 enclosed by the interferometer path , without changing the electron density inside .",
    "if the interference signal is caused by backscattering of @xmath1 quasiparticles at the constrictions of the interferometer , and if there are no localized qps inside the loop , then the phase of the interferometer signal will change by @xmath5 when the area is varied by an amount @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the magnetic field strength and @xmath8 is the flux quantum for an electron . for an odd number of bulk qps inside the interferometer cell",
    ", however , the leading sinusoidal dependence of the interference current on this phase is expected to vanish , while it is restored for an even number of bulk qps.@xcite this dependence of the interference signal on the parity of bulk qps in the interferometer cell constitutes the so - called even - odd effect .    in order for the even - odd effect to be observable ,",
    "it is necessary that the quantum state of the localized qps remain independent of time during the course of the current measurement .",
    "this can be a problem , in real systems , because of tunnel coupling between the bulk qps and the edge . in principle",
    ", one can imagine two types of tunnel couplings : tunneling of charged @xmath1 qps into and out of the interferometer cell @xcite , and coupling between bulk majorana degrees of freedom and the majorana mode along the edge .",
    "the former process should be suppressed by the requirement of charge neutrality due to the coulomb interaction , which is expected to be strong in small interference devices .",
    "the latter process is likely to be experimentally relevant , and it is this process which is the focus of the current paper .",
    "as tunnel matrix elements typically depend on distance in an exponential way , qps localized near the sample edge can have a sizable tunnel coupling . in device geometries defined by etch trenches or top gates",
    ", the electron density typically changes from its maximum value to zero over a distance of many magnetic lengths , such that one can expect the filling factor to deviate from the ideal value of 5/2 in some region near the interfering edge states .",
    "however , any deviation from the ideal filling fraction 5/2 implies a finite density of qps near the edge . due to the spatial proximity to the interfering edge states",
    ", these localized qps can have a significant tunnel coupling to the edge , and a realistic description of a non - abelian fabry - perot interferometer needs to take bulk - edge coupling into account .",
    "the case of one weakly coupled bulk qp was analyzed in perturbation theory by overbosch and wen @xcite , and the case of two bulk qps coupled to opposite edges was studied by the present authors .",
    "@xcite while for weak coupling , an analytic perturbative solution was possible , the strong coupling regime was analyzed numerically for a lattice model . it was found that at @xmath9 , the dimensionless parameter describing the strength of the bulk - edge coupling may be written as @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the tunnel - coupling strength , @xmath12 is the velocity of the majorana edge mode , @xmath13 is the source - drain voltage , and @xmath14 is the qp charge . for small values of this parameter ,",
    "bulk qps effectively decouple from the edge , while for a large coupling strength they are absorbed by the edge . in this manuscript , we present an exact solution for the influence of bulk - edge coupling on the magnitude and phase of interference in a non - abelian fabry - perot interferometer .",
    "for example , we analyze the case of a single bulk qp whose majorana mode is coupled to one edge of the interferometer .",
    "we find that the interference current can be exactly evaluated in the regime where the length @xmath15 of the interferometer is short compared to @xmath16 .",
    "the interference current is reduced relative to the case of no bulk impurity by the modulus of @xmath17 and the interference phase is shifted by the phase of this expression .",
    "thus , in the presence of bulk - edge coupling the even - odd effect is modified in an important way : instead of the absence of the leading harmonic of the interference current , this harmonic grows with decreasing voltage at a rate which is enhanced relative to the behavior in the absence of a bulk majorana mode ( the intensity grows @xmath18 instead of @xmath19 in the high voltage regime ) .",
    "in addition , there is a universal phase shift of @xmath20 in the low voltage regime relative to the high voltage regime . the result eq .",

    "we have also been able to examine the phase shift in the interference pattern introduced by the presence of a finite coupling between the bulk qps and the edge .",
    "in addition , the current paper presents various details of the analysis that had to be omitted from ref . due to lack of space .    in our work",
    ", we have particularly examined the case of a short interferometer , or relatively low voltage , where the interference visibility is largest . specifically , we assume @xmath46 , where , @xmath44 is the time needed for a neutral excitation to move along one edge , from one constriction the other , and @xmath278 is the extension in time of a qp wave packet transferred from one edge to the other by backscattering at one of the constrictions .",
    "we shall summarize here the qualitative results of our studies , and then say a few words about their implications for experiments .",
    "we start by discussing the case of a single bulk majorana mode inside the interferometer . in the absence of bulk - edge coupling , the leading harmonic of the interference signal vanishes . in agreement with previous analyses of this problem @xcite",
    ", we find that for weak coupling , at @xmath9 , interference can be observed but is reduced by a factor proportional to @xmath279 , where @xmath280 is the characteristic tunneling time associated with the exchange of a majorana particle between the localized qp and the edge . for large values of the effective coupling constant @xmath281 , the bulk majorana mode is effectively absorbed by the edge and the interference signal is fully restored , such that the strong coupling case corresponds to an interferometer with no bulk degree of freedom .",
    "in addition , on the way from weak to strong coupling , the phase of the interference signal is shifted by @xmath282 .",
    "although bulk - edge coupling enforces a modification of the way one looks at the even - odd effect , it actually enriches this effect with a new direction in parameter space , as the dimensionless coupling strength @xmath281 depends on source drain voltage .",
    "the signature for an odd number of impurities , with just one of them coupled to the edge , is not the complete absence of the leading harmonic , but rather a reduced amplitude , which depends on the applied voltage .",
    "the interference intensity grows with decreasing voltage at a rate which is enhanced relative to the behavior in the absence of a bulk majorana mode ( the intensity grows @xmath283 instead of @xmath19 ) until the reduction factor saturates at unity .",
    "in addition , when the reduction factor is small compared to unity , the interference factor will have universal phase shift of @xmath282 relative to the pattern in the strongly coupled regime .",
    "our results for a single bulk qp at @xmath9 can be readily generalized to the case of finite temperatures .",
    "qualitatively , the temperature will make relatively little difference as long as @xmath284 is small compared to @xmath285 .",
    "however in the opposite limit , temperature will be important , and its effect may be roughly estimated by replacing the the voltage time @xmath286 , in the formulas above , by the thermal time @xmath287",
    ". a more quantitative analysis can be given , but it will not be discussed here .    in the case of two bulk majorana modes coupled to opposite edges , with comparable coupling strengths , the average value of the interference signal shows the same qualitative behavior as in the case of a single impurity .",
    "however , the average value of the interference current now has a more subtle interpretation than in the case of a single impurity : due to the presence of the factor @xmath69 in the tunneling operator , the interference signal is sensitive to the state of the two bulk majorana modes even in the absence of bulk - edge coupling .",
    "although in the absence of bulk - edge coupling the expectation value of @xmath69 does not change in time once it is prepared in an eigenstate , the quantum statistical average @xmath288 is zero , as the average is taken over both possible states of the system .",
    "experimentally , then , the quantum statistical average corresponds to a situation where the interference signal is averaged over different initializations of the bulk states .    in the presence of weak but non - zero coupling between the bulk and edge modes ,",
    "two things happen : i ) the quantum mechanical average @xmath289 $ ] is now finite ; and ii ) for a single experiment starting with the bulk states initialized in an eigenstate of @xmath69 , the interference phase will fluctuate on the time scale @xmath290 , so that the time average of the interference current over these quantum mechanical fluctuations is equal to the quantum statistical average .",
    "now we must distinguish between two experimental situations .",
    "if the experimental measurement is averaged over a time @xmath291 that is long compared to one or both of the switching times @xmath292 , then the experiment will measure the statistical average interference signal , which will be very close to zero if @xmath293 is much longer than @xmath286 and @xmath294 . on the other hand ,",
    "if the bulk modes are so weakly coupled to the edge that for both bulk qps , @xmath295 , then the experiment will not measure a statistical average , but will see only one or the other of two possible fermion states . in this case",
    "one will see a full interference signal , with the same amplitude as if the impurities were not there at all , but with a phase that depends on the starting configuration of the system .",
    "more generally , we may distinguish three ranges of coupling strengths for a qp localized in the bulk . if coupling to the edge is so weak that @xmath295 , we may say that the bulk state is  decoupled \" from the edge . if the coupling is in the range where @xmath292 is small compared to @xmath286 and @xmath294 , then qp is  strongly coupled \" to the edge .",
    "if the coupling strength is in the range where @xmath292 is small compared to @xmath296 , but large compared to either @xmath286 or @xmath294 , then we may say that the qp is  weakly coupled \" to edge .    in an experiment",
    "where the interfering edge encloses two or more localized qps , we may ignore any strongly coupled qps , as they will be effectively incorporated into the edge .",
    "if there are no  weakly coupled \" qps inside the loop , then the presence or absence of the interference signal corresponding to charge e/4 will be determined by the number of decoupled qps inside the loop",
    ". the interference pattern will be present if this number is even , and absent otherwise .",
    "if there are any weakly coupled qps inside the loop , however , with relaxation time @xmath297 small compared to the experimental averaging time , then the interference pattern will be absent , regardless of the number of decoupled qps that may also be present .    in a recent experiment by willett et al .",
    "@xcite , resistance oscillations in a fabry - perot device were studied experimentally . for magnetic fields near a bulk filling fraction @xmath21 , oscillations in the longitudinal resistance",
    "were observed as a function of side gate voltage .",
    "depending on the range over which the side gate voltage was varied , consecutive doubling and halving of the voltage period of resistance oscillations was observed .",
    "the side gate voltage was interpreted as changing the area of the interferometer cell .",
    "if the bulk filling fraction deviates slightly from the exact value of @xmath298 , a change of area will once in a while change the number of qps inside the interferometer cell by one . if the number of qps changes from even to odd , the fundamental harmonic is suppressed and the period of the interference signal is halved , while for a change from an odd to an even number of localized qps inside the cell , the period is doubled .",
    "a reduced voltage period in the presence of an odd number of localized qps can arise from interference of abelian charge @xmath299 qps or from non - abelian charge @xmath3 qps encircling the interferometer cell twice .",
    "this interpretation of the experiment  @xcite is discussed in more detail in ref .  .",
    "a difficulty with this interpretation is that it seems to require that all qps inside the edge are either completely decoupled from the edge , or strongly coupled so that they are incorporated into the edge .",
    "if there any qps in the intermediate weakly coupled range , where the majorana state changes back and forth many times during the averaging time of the experiment , then the interference corresponding to charge e/4 would be completely absent , or at least greatly reduced in size .",
    "it is not clear to us , why there should be no weakly coupled qps inside the interferometer in the interference experiments of ref .",
    ", nor is it clear why one should be rid of their effects if such qps are present .",
    "we do note , however , that one possible ingredient that is missing from our analysis is a tunnel coupling that allows for an exchange of majorana fermions between bulk quasi - particles . in the presence of such a coupling",
    ", the degeneracy of the localized bulk majorana states is removed . the resulting spectrum is then composed of several states .",
    "each of these states corresponds to an interference pattern , whose amplitude and phase are determined by the expectation value and fluctuations of the parity operator in that state .",
    "the coupling of the bulk states to the propagating majorana mode of the edge introduces a width to these states , equilibrates them to the temperature of the edge , and thermally averages the interference pattern .",
    "then , if the splitting between the bulk states is large compared to their width and to the temperature , a well defined interference pattern will be observed .",
    "a recent estimate @xcite for the tunnel splitting between quasi - particles is rather sizeable , about @xmath300 for a separation of @xmath301 micron .",
    "this effect and the overall problem clearly require further investigation .",
    "altogether , the experimental results obtained so far are not yet well understood by theory , and it is not yet clear that the observed effects originate from the unique properties of non - abelian quasi - particles at @xmath21 .",
    "it is possible that a clue to that question may be obtained from the transition region between two different periods , when a change in the number of localized qps happens due to a change in area of the interferometer cell , and when the distance between edge and bulk qp decreases as a function of side gate voltage .",
    "then , the bulk - edge coupling should change from small to large values , and one can expect that the theory developed in this manuscript is applicable .",
    "it would be interesting to analyze the data of ref .",
    "from the point of view of bulk - edge coupling , and to test the theoretical prediction that in the transition region between different gate voltage periods the interference current has a modified power law dependence on source - drain voltage and that there is a @xmath302 phase shift as a function of source - drain voltage .",
