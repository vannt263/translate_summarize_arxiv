    "different issues have been raised in the context of the net neutrality debate . for tim berners - lee @xcite , it means that `` if i pay to connect to the net with a certain quality of service , and you pay to connect with that or greater quality of service , then we can communicate at that level . '' for tim wu @xcite , the main idea is that `` a maximally useful public information network aspires to treat all content , sites , and platforms equally . ''",
    "according to @xcite , it `` usually means that broadband service providers charge consumers only once for internet access , do not favor one content provider over another , and do not charge content providers for sending information over broadband lines to end users . ''",
    "these definitions raise different questions , including connectivity , non - discrimination of application , based on type or origin , and network access pricing .",
    "net neutrality is a subject involving a range of issues regarding the regulation of public networks @xcite : ( a ) content neutrality , ( b ) blocking and rerouting , ( c ) denying ip - network interconnection , ( d ) network management , and ( e ) premium service fees .",
    "( b ) pertains to providers discriminating packets in favor of their own or affiliated content , while ( c ) is related to agreements between last - mile and backbone providers .",
    "( d ) has been a central argument for isps protesting the enforcement of net neutrality principles : they defend their right to manage their own networks , especially in order to deal with congestion issues ( due to high - volume peer - to - peer ( p2p ) traffic , see the `` comcast v. the fcc '' decision @xcite ) .",
    "they claim that regulations would act as a disincentive for capacity expansion of their networks .    in this paper ,",
    "considering usage - based revenues , we address issues from topic ( a ) : side payments among providers and application neutrality .",
    "massive copyright infringements led copyright holders to seek remuneration from isps , while congestion due to p2p file sharing led some providers to adopt not application - neutral policies ( comcast throttling bittorrent traffic ) and to consider usage pricing ( as a congestion penalty , for overage of a monthly quota , or for premium service , @xcite ) . in what follows ,",
    "we study side payments ( from internet service ( access ) providers ( isps ) to content providers ( cps ) , or in the reverse direction ) and consider the impact of not application - neutral pricing independent of congestion .",
    "that is , we assume consumers are , to some extent , willing to pay usage - dependent fees .",
    "providers are then competing to settle on their usage - based prices , their goal being to maximize revenues coming from these charges .",
    "note that a null price in the following does not mean a provider has no income , but rather that all their monthly revenues come from flat - rate priced service components .",
    "study of the flat - rate regime is , however , out of the scope of this paper .",
    "see , @xcite for a comparison of both regimes for a simple model of congestion management .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss related work in subsection [ subsec : related ] and describe our problem framework in section [ sec : setup ] . in section [ sec : side ] , we study the impact of side payments on the competition between providers .",
    "we extend our framework in section [ sec : app ] to analyze the effect of not application - neutral pricing by the isps .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] and discuss future work .",
    "previously , we considered certain net neutrality related issues like side payments and premium service fees ( e ) , limiting our consideration to monopolistic providers @xcite . in the following , we extend this model to include competition between multiple identical providers ( actually based on an idea sketched in section iv of @xcite ) .",
    "the validity of the isps argument that net neutrality is a disincentive for bandwidth expansion has been studied in @xcite . in the proposed framework , incentives for broadband providers to expand infrastructure capacity turned out to be higher under net neutrality , with isps tending to under- or over - invest in the non - neutral regime .",
    "ma @xcite advocate the use of shapley values as a fair way to share profits between providers .",
    "this approach yields pareto optimality for all players , and expects in particular cps , many of whom receive advertising revenues , to take part in network - capacity investments . however , this approach is coalitional and there are many obstacles to its real - life implementation .",
    "@xcite deals with the question of side payments and deploys a framework in which cps can subsidize consumers connectivity costs .",
    "the authors compare an unregulated regime with a `` net neutral '' one where restrictions apply on the maximum price isps can charge content providers .",
    "they find out that , even in the neutral case , cps can benefit from sharing revenue from end users if the latter are sufficiently price sensitive ( and the cost of connectivity is low enough ) .",
    "their framework is insightful , but does not take cp revenues into consideration .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors address whether local isps should be allowed to charge remote cps for the `` right '' to reach their end users ( again , this is the side payment issue ) . through study of a two - sided market",
    ", they determine when neutrality regulations are harmful depending on the parameters characterizing advertising rates and consumer price sensitivity .",
    "we study a similar issue in section [ sec : side ] , yet with a significantly different scenario . in @xcite ,",
    "the isps invest in network infrastructure , and then the cps invest depending on the quality of the resulting network .",
    "the difference in time and scale of these investments justifies a leader - follower dynamics .",
    "now in our model we suppose that the network is already deployed and that providers are setting up usage - based pricing to leverage ongoing revenues .",
    "for example , our scenario could be at&t beginning to charge google would like to do is use my pipes free , but i ai nt going to let them do that because we have spent this capital and we have to have a return on it . '' ] and its customers on a usage - based basis , while the leader - follower scenario would be closer to isps investing in optical fiber connections and high - quality video - on - demand providers coming to the new market .",
    "otherwise , both models share some assumptions , including a fixed number of players , homogeneous providers , and a uniform distribution of consumers among providers once the price war has ended .",
    "however , our cps revenues come from usage - based fees rather than advertising how to take both into account . ] , and our content consumption model is different : users subscribe to one cp and get all their content from him",
    ". this could be the case , with online newspapers , music stores , video on demand , though this setting is more restrictive than a network where users are willing to access all cps , it is of practical use and fits more to the homogeneity assumption .",
    "the net neutrality debate is discussed in @xcite in light of historical precedents , especially dealing with the question of price discrimination .",
    "a conclusion about the way customers value the network is that connectivity is far more important than content .",
    "our model encompasses three types of players : the internauts ( end users ) , modeled collectively by their demand response , @xmath0 last - mile isps , and @xmath1 cps .",
    "consumers pay providers usage - dependent fees for service and content that requires one isp and one cp .",
    "providers then compete in a game to settle on their usage - based prices , which may turn out to be 0$/byte , only flat - rate fees would apply .",
    "let us denote by @xmath2 ( resp .",
    "@xmath3 ) the usage - based price of the @xmath4 isp ( resp . @xmath5",
    "these prices act as disincentives on consumers demand for content and bandwidth .",
    "we model this with a simple linear response : the amount users are ready to consume , given that they chose isp @xmath6 and cp @xmath7 , is @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the demand _ sensitivity _ to price paid to provider of type @xmath10 ( the first subscript @xmath11 for isp and @xmath12 for cp ) .",
    "we are dealing here with a set of homogeneous users sharing the same response to price variations .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 reflects demand under pure flat - rate pricing .",
    "note that all providers may not measure demand on the same scale : isps focus on bandwidth consumption and express demand in bytes , while cps are concerned with content consumption and/or advertising revenues , thus expressing demand in number of clicks or products sold ( books , music albums , _ etc .",
    "however , using a single demand metric is very convenient for our purposes here , and other metrics can be approximated from this one using an appropriate scaling factor .    in what follows",
    ", we furthermore suppose that users are only concerned with the total usage - based price they are charged , they do nt care whether they are giving money to an isp or a cp .",
    "equal demand sensitivies to price ensue , @xmath14 . since @xmath15 , define the maximum price @xmath16      as we suppose all providers of a given type propose the _",
    "same _ type / quality of content / service , user decisions are only based on price considerations . for example , if an isp charges a price significantly lower than the other isps , in the long run all customers will choose it and the others will have no choice but to align their prices or opt out of the game .",
    "therefore , our homogeneity hypothesis means all @xmath0 isps ( and similarly all @xmath1 cps ) have roughly the same prices : @xmath17 as providers play the usage - based pricing game , first - order differences between these prices may appear ( + the @xmath4 isp reducing his price by @xmath18 to attract new end users ) .",
    "consumers are then more likely to go to the cheapest providers of each type , but price differences may be too small to convince all of them to move and some will stay with their current provider .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ customer stickiness _ , _ inertia _ or _",
    "loyalty_. to model it , we define the fraction @xmath19 of users committed to the @xmath4 provider of the @xmath20 type ( @xmath11 for isps and 2 for cps ) as a function of @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "properties expected of the `` stickiness function '' @xmath23 include :    * @xmath24 and @xmath25 ; * if @xmath26 , then @xmath27 ; and * @xmath28 .    in other words ,",
    "the distribution is uniform if all providers of a given type charge exactly the same price , and ensures otherwise that cheaper providers attract more consumers .",
    "we chose the following model which satisfies these properties : @xmath29 the average usage - based price charged by a provider of type @xmath10 for a customer is then @xmath30 the harmonic mean of @xmath31 .      in",
    "a `` neutral '' setting with no side payments nor application discrimination , the @xmath4 isp s expected usage - based revenue is given by @xmath32 and similarly @xmath33 for the @xmath5 cp .",
    "then , @xmath34 u_{1i}.\\ ] ] a necessary condition for an interior equilibrium is @xmath35 , which in this case yields @xmath36 . combining with the similar condition for cps , we get a non - singular linear system whose solution is @xmath37 demand and revenues are then given by @xmath38 for @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "this solution is actually a nash equilibrium point ( nep ) since @xmath41 which means it is a local maximum in revenue for all players .",
    "as expected , customers benefit from competition among the providers .",
    "see figure [ fig : neutral - d ] . with 2 isps and 2 cps ,",
    "demand is only @xmath42 of its potential @xmath13 , while it is about @xmath43 of @xmath13 with 5 isps and 5 cps .",
    "this base model also encompasses two expected behaviors : providers of one type benefit from increased competition among those of the other , while their revenues are significantly reduced by increased competition in their own group ( see figure [ fig : neutral - u ] ) .",
    "note that competition in a provider s own group has much greater impact on their income than competition in the other .",
    "suppose now that there are side payments between the two types of providers .",
    "we introduce a usage - based fee @xmath44 from the cps to the isps .",
    "when @xmath45 , cps remunerate the isps , to support the bandwidth costs or share in advertising revenue . on the other hand , if @xmath46 , isps give money to the cps , for copyright remuneration .",
    "we suppose isps or cps receive side payments collectively and ultimately share the aggregate amount proportionally to their customer shares .",
    "hence , provider revenues become : @xmath47 where all demand and price factors are non - negative .",
    "it is expected that @xmath44 is _ not _ a decision variable for any player or group of players .",
    "indeed , since revenues are monotonic in @xmath44 , those controlling it would always be incented to increase or decrease it ( if they are isps or cps respectively ) , leading the other players to opt out of the competition .",
    "therefore , @xmath44 would normally be regulated and we will consider it a _ fixed _ parameter from now on .    necessary conditions for an interior equilibrium ( null first - derivatives of revenues ) yield : @xmath48 ( \\bp_1 + p_s ) + p_s & = & 0 , \\\\",

    "so , we begin with a study of a simplified setting where @xmath49 .      first ,",

    "we can rewrite equilibrium conditions as @xmath53 now , change variables to @xmath54 and @xmath55 to simplify these conditions to @xmath56 where ( [ e1 ] ) @xmath57 ( [ c1 ] ) @xmath58 ( [ c2 ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) @xmath57 ( [ c1 ] ) @xmath59 ( [ c2 ] ) .",
    "equilibrium prices , demand and revenues are now solvable in closed form .",
    "an important observation we can make at this point is given by the following theorem :    [ thm : side - threshold ] when @xmath49 , there is an interior nep iff @xmath60 } \\sqrt{\\frac{(1-x)(1 - 2x)^2(4x-1)}{36x } }      \\ \\approx \\ 4.64 \\% .\\ ] ]    in other words , regulated side payments can only occur _ to a small extent _ ( @xmath61 of @xmath62 ) , otherwise there will be _ no interior _ nep , which means one of the two groups of players will opt out of the usage - based pricing game .",

    "there are two solutions to ( [ side - equ1 ] ) and ( [ side - equ2 ] ) . for any solution @xmath95 to this system ,",
    "@xmath96 given that @xmath97 for @xmath39 ( in a valid solution , players paying side payments can not get negative revenues ) . thus ,",
    "both the critical points we computed are also interior nash equilibrium points ( neps ) .",
    "generally , additional neps may exist on the boundary of the play - action space .",
    "demand and revenues at @xmath98 and @xmath99 are shown in figures [ fig : side - nep1 ] and [ fig : side - nep2 ] .",

    "we presented an idealized framework to study the impact of two net - neutrality related issues , side payments and application neutrality , on the interactions among end users , isps and cps .",
    "our revenue model relied on a simple , common linear demand response to usage - based prices , and it accounted for customer loyalty .",
    "we studied the effect of regulated side payments between the isps and cps .",
    "the two possible outcomes of the competition both showed the same paradox : side payments are actually a handicap for those who receive them insofar as they reduce nash equilibrium revenues .",
    "we also studied the issue of application neutrality in a simple setting involving two types of content , web content and file sharing , the latter showing lower price sensitivity and higher willingness to pay under our assumptions of relative demand sensitivity to price .",
    "our analysis suggested that isps and web cps benefit from application non - neutral practices , while providers that enable content dissemination by p2p means are better off in a neutral setting .",

    "is to add advertisers to the game , reacting to prices @xmath192 set by cps in a way similar to consumers , with linear demand - response and advertiser stickiness .",
    "their demand @xmath193 should be increasing with consumers demand , and decreasing with @xmath189 , @xmath194 ( cps revenues being @xmath195 ) .",
