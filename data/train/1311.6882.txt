    "among different nontrivial magnetization distributions in the nanoscale , magnetic vortices attract a special interest because the vortex configuration can form a ground state in nano- and micron - sized ferromagnets .",
    "it takes place when the sample size exceeds the single - domain size due to the competition between exchange field and a stray one in magnets with small magnetocrystalline anisotropy @xcite .",
    "nontrivial topological properties of vortices @xcite attract interest to their study with perspective application to the high - density magnetic storage devices , nonvolatile magnetic vortex random - access memories @xcite .    in common with stray field effects which favour the vortex configuration , the vortex can form the lowest energy state in magnets with a surface anisotropy @xcite .",
    "such anisotropy , which always appears in real samples , is originated from the symmetry breaking for the boundary sites of the lattice and can result in the specific uniaxial single - ion anisotropy of different sings @xcite . in the disk - shaped magnets the edge surface anisotropy",
    "can pin the magnetization along the border in the circular , i.e. in the vortex , configuration @xcite .",
    "similarity between the effects of the stray field and the surface anisotropy is not casual : effective surface anisotropy in thin nanomagnets is known to be induced by the dipolar interaction @xcite .    in this work we study analytically and numerically the influence of the single - ion uniaxial surface anisotropy of different types , easy ",
    "surface ( es ) and easy  normal ( en ) , on the three - dimensional ( 3d ) vortex shape for the heisenberg magnet .",
    "we show that the presence of the surface anisotropy breaks the symmetry of magnetization structure in the axial @xmath0direction , which naturally leads to @xmath0dependence of the vortex core width : there appears the barrel- and the pillow- deformation of the core for the es and en anisotropies , respectively .",
    "the model we consider is a ferromagnetic system , described by the classical heisenberg hamiltonian    [ eq : h - total ] @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the exchange integral , @xmath3 is the length of classical spin , @xmath4 is the normalized magnetic moment on a 3d site position @xmath5 , the 3d index @xmath6 runs over the nearest neighbours , and @xmath7 is the anisotropy part of the hamiltonian .",
    "we take into account the bulk on  site anisotropy with the constant @xmath8 ( easy  plane anisotropy ) and the surface one with the surface anisotropy constant @xmath9 @xcite @xmath10    here the last term describes the nel surface anisotropy with the unit vector @xmath11 connecting the magnetic moment @xmath12 from the surface site @xmath13 to its nearest neighbour @xmath14 .",

    "the total energy , the continuum version of the hamiltonian , normalized by @xmath21 has the following form @xmath22,\\\\ \\mathscr{e}_s & = \\frac{\\varkappa a}{2}\\int \\mathrm{d}s ( { \\bm{m}}\\cdot { \\bm{n}}_{s})^2 \\end{split}\\ ] ] with @xmath23 being the magnetic length .",
    "the last term @xmath24 is the transverse surface anisotropy , the continuum analogue of nel surface anisotropy with @xmath25 being the normal to the surface and the parameter @xmath26 being the surface anisotropy rate . in the further study",
    "we consider the cases of both es anisotropy when @xmath27 and the en one when @xmath28 .",
    "the equilibrium magnetization structure can be found by variation of the energy functional , which results in the following boundary - value problem : @xcite    [ eq : bvp - tot ] @xmath29 = 0,\\\\ \\label{eq : bvp - tot-2 } \\ell^2\\frac{\\partial { \\bm{m}}}{\\partial { \\bm{n}}_s}\\biggr|_{s } = \\varkappa a ( { \\bm{m}}\\cdot{\\bm{n}}_s )   \\left [ ( { \\bm{m}}\\cdot{\\bm{n}}_s ) { \\bm{m } } - { \\bm{n}}_s\\right]\\biggr|_{s}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    one can see that the presence of the surface anisotropy changes the symmetry of boundary conditions , leading to the robin boundary conditions instead of the neumann ones @xcite . as a result",
    "the symmetry breaking the magnetization structure becomes @xmath30dependent .",
    "in particular , we will see that the vortex core width takes different values in a volume and on the surface .",

    "supposing that @xmath48 , we can replace the boundary condition by @xmath49    the problem is the nonlinear boundary  value problem for the partial differential equation for the function . to simplify the analysis we use the variational approach with ansatz ",

    "surface surface anisotropy the total anisotropy coefficient per site @xmath87 on the face surface sites is larger than inside volume ones .",
    "it results in the decreasing of the effective magnetic length @xmath88 on the face surfaces . due to the exchange coupling between lattice layers a smooth change of the @xmath89 occurs .",

    "the equilibrium value of the reduced vortex width in the absence of the surface anisotropy is @xmath90 .",

    "the inset shows the comparison of the vortex shape from simulations with the ansatz  .",
    "let us discuss how the predicted effects can influence the vortex statics and dynamics in nanomagnetic particles .",
    "typical magnetic nanodots are the samples of confined ferromagnet with weak anisotropy",
    ". the vortex configuration in such magnets can be their ground state .",
    "for example , in permalloy disk - shaped samples the vortex state is realized if the disk diameter exceeds 50 nm@xcite .",
    "the reason is that the vortex configuration favours the dipolar interaction ( the stray field is absent for the pure vortex state ) .",
    "this can be explained by the language of effective anisotropy , induced by the dipolar interaction @xcite . for thin magnets",
    "the effective spatial - dependent anisotropy contribution is localized near the edge of the particle so that magnetization will be tangent to the boundary @xcite .",
    "this confirms the notion of a surface edge anisotropy .",
    "the vortex core creates nonvanishing surface magnetostatic charges of opposite signs on the different face surfaces .",
    "their minimization leads to a complicated vortex profile both in plane and in the axial direction  @xcite .",
    "when the nanodot thickness becomes comparable with a few exchange lengths , the thickness of the bloch line appreciably varies along the thickness coordinate , see  @xcite .",
    "this conclusion agrees with our statement about the varying width @xmath51 defined in eq .  .",
    "in this context it is instructive to make a link with another way to describe the inhomogeneity of the vortex width proposed in ref .",
    "the trial functions @xmath91 $ ] and @xmath92 was used to describe an influence of magnetostatics , where @xmath93 and the radial component of magnetization is obtained from the condition of the absence of the total volume magnetostatic charge .",
    "the unknown coefficients @xmath94 , @xmath95 and @xmath96 were calculated through minimization of the total energy . in the our surface anisotropy",
    "approach the expression for @xmath64 can be obtained directly with enough accuracy .    in conclusion ,",
    "the shape of the vortex in the 3d heisenberg magnet with single - ion bulk and surface anisotropies is studied analytically and numerically .",
    "it is shown that the vortex width varies along the disk axis and its shape is dependent on the sign of the surface anisotropy coefficient .",
    "vortex becomes barrel  shaped for the easy ",
    "surface surface anisotropy and pillow  shaped for the easy ",
    "normal one .    taking into account surface anisotropy ,",
    "the magnetization distribution naturally becomes inhomogeneous in the axial direction . in the effect of the axial dependence of the magnetization it is similar to the influence of the stray fields .",
    "the demagnetizing field in the vortex core region causes the twisting of the in - plane core magnetization and barrel  shaped vortex width along the nanodisk axis  @xcite . for sufficiently thin samples a homogeneous magnetization distribution along thickness",
    "is usually used  @xcite and the polarity reversal occurs through the planar vortex formation . in the permalloy nanodisks of thickness  50 nm is was shown numerically that it is accompanied by the bloch points nucleation  @xcite .",
    "we expect that the surface anisotropy for the nanoparticles in the vortex state allows to expect the change of the polarity switching mechanism to the second one .",
