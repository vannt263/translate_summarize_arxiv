    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are powered by mass accretion onto a supermassive black hole .",
    "but while most of the gas is accreted by the black hole , some fraction of the gas is blown out of the central engine in powerful winds .",
    "these outflows are seen as the blue - shifted absorption lines primarily in the rest - frame uv spectra for about @xmath8%  of agn as narrow absorption lines @xcite and for about @xmath9 to 40%  as broad blue - shifted absorption troughs ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "outflows are an essential part of the agn phenomenon because they can carry away angular momentum and thus facilitate accretion through a disk .",
    "winds are important probes of the chemical abundances in agn , which appear to be elevated @xcite .",
    "they can distribute chemically - enriched gas through the intergalactic medium @xcite .",
    "they may carry kinetic energy to the host galaxy , influencing its evolution , and contributing to the coevolution of black holes and galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "physical properties , including the mass and origin of agn outflows , remain largely mysterious .",
    "it is particularly important to understand the acceleration mechanism .",
    "resonance - line absorption ( i.e. , continuum photons are absorbed as permitted transitions in ions ) is a promising mechanism , and there is compelling evidence that it is present in a few objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other mechanisms include hydromagnetic acceleration @xcite and acceleration due to dust @xcite .",
    "as discussed by @xcite , different acceleration mechanisms may dominate in different parts of the outflow .",
    "these models could in principle be distinguished by measuring the properties of the outflow .",
    "so , for example , while resonance - line absorption is a compelling mechanism ( since we see the troughs created by absorption ) , there is evidence in some cases that the mass - outflow rates may be too high for it to be feasible ( e.g. , hamann et al .   1997 ; leighly et al .",
    "thus , kinetic energy is a sensible discriminant for these models ; e.g. , we ask , is there sufficient energy available to accelerate wind of a particular column density to a particular velocity ?",
    "determining the kinetic energy deposited into the wind requires measurement of the velocity , which can be obtained directly from the absorption line profile , assuming that the flow is radial , and the column density , which is much more difficult to measure .",
    "the uv lines have apparent optical depths generally less than one , so it appears that column densities could be determined by simply integrating over the apparent optical depth profile .",
    "however , it is now known that the lines are generally saturated , although not black , implying that the absorbing material only partially covers the source ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the column density and covering fraction can be solved for in special cases when two or more lines from the same lower level can be measured ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for example , atomic physics requires that the 1548  component of the doublet have twice the optical depth of the 1551  component .",
    "partial covering gives an apparent optical depth ratio of less than two .",
    "the measurements of the two lines can be used to solve for the two unknowns , the optical depth and covering fraction .",
    "this method , while powerful , has limitations .",
    "blending can be a problem when the lines are broad .",
    "for example , the doublet at 1548 and 1551 is a suitable pair of lines for this method , since these two transitions have the same lower level .",
    "however , their separation is only 2.6 , corresponding to only @xmath10 .",
    "while these lines may be resolved in narrow - line objects , they will be profoundly blended in objects with broad lines .",
    "in addition , this method fails if the lines are saturated .",
    "lines from permitted transitions in ions from relatively abundant elements saturate easily at relatively low column densities .",
    "examples of such lines are those that are most easily recognized in balqsos , such as .",
    "@xmath11 has been recognized as a valuable probe of higher column densities @xcite because of its low elemental abundance , only @xmath12 that of carbon @xcite .",
    "so , from the observation of in a quasar , we can generally infer that and similar lines are saturated , even though they may not be black",
    ".    however , has the problem in that it falls in the far uv part of the spectrum .",
    "it is therefore , in practice , accessible only by space - based observatories , except in balqsos with redshifts greater than @xmath13 . in high - redshift objects , however ,",
    "ly@xmath14 forest lines ablate the spectrum in the far uv , and may be difficult to measure .    in this paper , we report the discovery of the first * @xmath0 broad absorption line quasar fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 .",
    "absorption has been seen in the * @xmath15 transition ( a transition to 3p from the metastable 2s level in the triplet ) in several quasars and seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , mrk  231 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but it has never before been reported in the 10830 transition ( a transition to 2p from the metastable state ) .",
    "we also discuss the use of * absorption lines at 3889 and 10830 for detecting low - redshift , high - column - density balqsos .",
    "* offers a number of advantages .",
    "the metastable state is populated by recombination from he@xmath16 , so it is a high - ionization line , produced in the same gas as the usual resonance lines such as @xmath17 .",
    "the metastable state has a low abundance , comparable to that of @xmath18 .",
    "the two * transitions are widely separated and located in a region of the spectrum where there are few other absorption lines , so blending is not a problem .",
    "they are located in the optical and infrared , so observation is possible from the ground .",
    "observation is then limited to lower - redshift quasars , but turns out to be a valuable property because there are now only a handful of low - redshift balqsos known , many discovered serendipitously in space - uv spectra taken for other reasons .",
    "finally , these two lines have a high ratio of @xmath19 , compared with @xmath20 for the usual resonance lines .",
    "this means that the two lines together are useful over a larger range of high column densities .",
    "although the * @xmath0 line has so far not been used extensively in the study of quasars , its value has been recognized for the study of other objects , including winds in young stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "how metastable is the * 2s triplet state ?",
    "the calculation of the rate of decay for this and for * 2s has a fascinating history .",
    "electric dipole transitions are strictly forbidden .",
    "electric quadrupole and magnetic dipole transitions are forbidden . however , decay via a two - photon process is possible @xcite .",
    "the rate for the two - photon process was computed for and discussed for by @xcite .",
    "they found that while the lifetime of the singlet state of should be similar to that of hydrogen , at @xmath21@xmath22 seconds , the lifetime of the triplet state should be about @xmath23 times smaller , or @xmath24 days .",
    "the lifetime was then calculated by @xcite to be about 0.5 days . but @xcite showed that the analysis performed by @xcite was not applicable to the triplet state , because while the singlet state decay has net @xmath25 , the triplet state decay transports one quantum of angular momentum .",
    "in @xcite they show that the lifetime of the metastable state for the two - photon decay should be 7.9 years .",
    "but then features from transitions from the triplet state to the ground from helium - like ions were observed in the laboratory and the sun , implying that there must be a direct transition from the metastable state to the ground @xcite .",
    "the key lay apparently in the relativistic corrections to the magnetic dipole transition .",
    "@xcite derived rates commensurate with the observation using an approximate dirac theory . finally , @xcite calculated the rate using higher order terms yielding the current best estimate of then lifetime of 2.2 hours .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in  2 , we describe the infrared and optical observations of fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 , the extraction of the apparent optical depth profiles , and application of partial covering models to extract the true column density and covering fraction . in  3 , we use _ cloudy _ modeling to extract column density information from the results , and to compute synthetic uv spectra .  4",

    "the infrared spectroscopic observations were made at the nasa infrared telescope facility ( irtf ) using the spex spectrograph @xcite in the short cross - dispersed mode ( sxd ) with an effective bandpass of 0.82.4@xmath32 as part of another project .",
    "the observations were made 2008 march 2830 and 2008 august 2224 .",

    "we use the spectra from fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 , pg  1543@xmath1489 , phl  1811 , and fbqs  j1702@xmath13247 ; these were all observed with a 0.8  slit for effective exposures of 2 , 1.7 , 2.9 and 1 hour(s ) respectively .",
    "flat - field lamps and line lamps were observed along with each object .",
    "a nearby early a - type star was also observed along with each object .",
    "the spectra were reduced using the idl software spextool @xcite .",
    "the flux calibration and correction for telluric features was performed using the a star spectrum and employing distributed idl software that use the methods described in @xcite . in the vicinity of the absorption feature ( at approximate 1.4@xmath32 in the observed frame ) ,",
    "the fwhm resolution measured from the line - lamp spectra ranged from @xmath33 to @xmath34 at the short wavelength end of the 4th spectral order to @xmath35 at the long wavelength end of the 5th spectral order . the spectrum is shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] .",
    "the short wavelength end of the absorption feature occurs at the long wavelength end of the 5th spectral order .",
    "there is a prominent telluric absorption band between @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in addition , the effective area is dropping off at the end of the order .",
    "unfortunately , our feature is partially compromised by these issues .",
    "is it possible that the absorption feature is somehow an artifact of the data reduction ?",
    "this is not likely , primarily because the long wavelength end of the absorption feature is found on both the long wavelength end of the 5th spectral order , and on the short wavelength end of the 4th spectral order , and both have the precisely the same shape .",
    "in addition , fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 is a relatively bright quasar for the _ irtf _ , and the telluric correction method is very reliable @xcite .",
    "the spectra were corrected for galactic reddening using @xmath38 ( derived from the infrared cirrus , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) using the ccm reddening curve @xcite .",
    "the redshifts were derived from the _ irtf _ spectra assuming that h@xmath14 , paschen @xmath39 and paschen @xmath14 are observed at the rest wavelengths . for fbqs",

    "these are insignificantly different from the values listed in ned .",
    "the spectra were shifted into the rest frame using these redshift values .",
    "finally , the spectra were modestly smoothed . ] .      as discussed in e.g. , @xcite , the apparent optical depth of an absorption feature",
    "is given by @xmath40 $ ] , where @xmath41 is the observed spectral intensity , and @xmath42 is the unabsorbed spectral intensity . the irtf spectrum of fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 yields @xmath41 , of course . in order to obtain the apparent optical depth , we need to obtain the intrinsic continuum @xmath43 .",
    "the lines in the near ir spectra of quasars are relatively unblended , compared with the optical and near uv bands ; however , the continuum in this region of the spectrum transitions from the agn power law at longer wavelengths to the dust - reprocessing feature at shorter wavelengths ( fig .  [ fig1 ] ) . in fbqs",
    "j1151@xmath13822 , it appears that this change in the continuum occurs very near the absorption feature .    to obtain @xmath43 ,",
    "we used the following procedure .",
    "first , we determined that of the 12 objects that we observed , pg  1543@xmath1489 , phl  1811 , and fbqs  j1702@xmath13247 had spectra most similar to that of fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 outside of the absorption region .",
    "in addition , we downloaded the spectra presented by @xcite and found two additional objects that resemble fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 : pds  456 and he  1228@xmath1013 .",
    "the spectra were similar to that of fbqs j1151@xmath13822 in terms of emission lines , but different in their continuum slopes .",
    "we used line - free regions in fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 and each of the comparison objects to determine power laws that the comparison - object spectra could be divided by so that their continua would match that of fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 .",
    "we then performed this continuum transformation .",
    "the procedure above works quite well for the continuum correction",
    ". however , several of the objects have significantly higher equivalent widths than fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 . to scale the lines , we need to divide each spectrum by its continuum .",
    "we focus on a limited wavelength range between 0.79 and 1.4@xmath32 and fit the line - free continuum bands of each object with a 4th order polynomial . each spectrum",
    "was then divided by this polynomial .",
    "finally , the spectra were suitably scaled .",
    "the following scale factors were used : pg  1543@xmath1489 : 0.73 ; phl  1811 : 1.1 ; fbqs  j1702@xmath13247 : 0.75 ; pds  456 : 1.0 ; he  1228@xmath1013 : 0.61 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the figure shows that all objects are rather similar over most of the range shown except for the long - wavelength side of the /pa@xmath44 feature . in particular , in the region of the absorption feature which is seen to stretch between 1.044 and 1.082@xmath32 ,",
    "most objects are quite similar except for pds  456 which is seen to exhibit some strange feature near 1.07 microns @xcite .",
    "since phl  1811 has by far the best signal - to - noise ratio of all of the spectra presented , we use the scaled version shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] as the intrinsic spectral intensity @xmath43 . except for pds  456 ,",
    "the other spectra match that of phl  1811 within about 5% , and we take that value as the systematic uncertainty in our estimate of @xmath43 .",
    "the resolution of the irtf spectra in the region of the feature is about @xmath45 .",
    "binning the fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 spectrum by a factor of two yields slightly more than two bins per resolution element .",
    "the phl 1811 spectrum was resampled on the same wavelengths as the fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 spectrum .",
    "the irtf spectra were were extracted using the optimal extraction technique @xcite .",
    "this method produces statistical errors that appear to be too small .",
    "specifically , the standard deviation in the data in relatively flat and smooth regions of the continua are systematically several factors larger than the assigned errors . to account for this trend",
    ", we increase the size of the error bars by a factor of 6 for the phl 1811 spectrum , and a factor of 4 for the fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 spectrum .",
    "then , between 1.0 and 1.1 microns , in the region of the absorption feature , the signal to noise ratios range between about 16 and 130 for the fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 spectrum and are about 200 uniformly for the phl 1811 spectrum .    using these spectra ,",
    "the ratio and apparent optical depth were computed as a function of velocity .",
    "the resulting ratio is shown in fig .",
    "the maximum velocity @xmath46 is @xmath47 , showing that fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 is truely a broad absorption line quasar .",
    "we analyzed two optical spectra of fbqs j1151@xmath13822 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey observed the object 2005 march 11 for 4600.4 seconds .",
    "the spectrum was extracted from the archive , rewritten in text format , and a moderate amount of smoothing was applied as mentioned in  2.1 .",
    "the sdss redshift was @xmath48 .",
    "we remeasured the redshift using the balmer lines and estimated it to be 0.3341 .",
    "the spectrum was corrected for redshift and reddening as above .",
    "the object was also observed at the mdm observatory 2.4 meter hilter telescope and the ccds spectrograph on january 3 , 2009 for 1 hour .",
    "we used a grating with @xmath49 and a 1  slit yielding observed - frame spectra between @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "conditions were non - photometric .",
    "the spectra were reduced in a standard way independently using midas ( md ) and iraf ( kml , sb ) ; the results were consistent . the signal - to - noise ratio of the fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 was estimated to be approximately 70 .",
    "the fwhm resolution in the vicinity of the @xmath15 line was found to be about @xmath52 from the line lamps .",
    "extraction of the apparent optical depth of the * @xmath15 feature from either the sdss or mdm spectrum is challenging .",
    "first , as can be seen in fig .  [ fig4 ] , the apparent optical depth of the 3889  feature is quite small .",
    "this is expected , since the ratio of @xmath53 between the 10830 and 3889 components is 23.3 , which means that on the linear part of the curve of growth , the true optical depths of these lines should have the a ratio of 23.3 @xcite .",
    "second , the continuum is not a power law ; rather , fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 is a strong emitter and the continuum includes a forest of lines .",
    "in fact , to the casual observer , the only clearly apparent absorption lines are the h&k lines . without knowing that there is a 10830 absorption trough in this object , the lines are easily confused with the continuum .",
    "thus , fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 had never before been recognized to be a balqso .",
    "we need a suitable estimation of the continuum to extract the optical depths .",
    "the usual i  zw  1 template @xcite is inadequate because it does not cover the shorter wavelengths around * @xmath15 that we need , so we developed a template from sdss spectra .",
    "we selected a sample of 28 bright low - redshift quasars that have sufficiently narrow lines that the complexes near h@xmath39 are resolved . from these , we constructed an average line spectrum as follows .",
    "the spectra , de - reddened and transformed to the rest frame , were resampled onto a common wavelength range between 2869 ( the lower wavelength limit of the sdss spectrum of fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 ) and 4750 ( considered the upper limit to avoid h@xmath39 , as that line can be quite variable between objects ) .",
    "the spectra were normalized by dividing by the average flux obtained from a 21-element bin located in the middle of the chosen wavelength range .",
    "the power law slope of the continuum was estimated by fitting a power law to the flux in line - free bands , and all spectra were normalized using this estimated value to slope of 1.96 ( i.e , where @xmath54 ) . at each wavelength , the mean spectrum was computed , and finally , the power law estimated from the line - free bands was subtracted yielding an average line spectrum .",
    "the sdss and mdm spectra were then fitted using this line model excluding the regions where absorption lines , both originating in and , may be present . for the sdss spectrum",
    "the excluded regions were 30153188.7 and 36783958  .",
    "for the mdm spectrum , with its more limited wavelength coverage , only the second region was excluded .",
    "four parameters were fit : the reddening of the input spectrum ( i.e. , the observed spectrum was dereddened by an input amount ) , the power law index , the power law normalization , and the line normalization .",
    "a figure of merit was computed at each grid point , and the minimum of the grid identified the best fit .",
    "the figure of merit used was the absolute value of the difference between the unreddened input spectrum , and the power law plus line flux model , divided by the unreddened uncertainty in the case of the sdss spectrum ( the mdm spectrum , produced by iraf , had no formal uncertainties ) .",
    "the sdss spectrum includes a notable feature between @xmath553300 probably originating in multiplets m6 and m7 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. , ) .",
    "the shape of the iron continuum varies from object to object in the uv ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and so it is possible that it also varies in the optical .",
    "we therefore create an alternative line spectrum from seven of the 28 objects which shows the largest excess variance between 31703300  .",
    "a large value of excess variance chooses objects which both have prominent features and good signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "we then fit the mdm and sdss spectra with this alternative continuum .",
    "it is clear that the uncertainty in the results produced by the procedure described above will be dominated by the systematic errors associated with the fact that the spectrum is not identical among agns .",
    "an estimate of the systematic error can be obtained from the standard deviation of the mean spectrum from the sample used to create the continuum .",
    "the standard deviation in the region of the absorption feature has an offset due to normalization offsets in the average spectra , plus fluctuations with scales of tens of angstroms with an amplitude of about 2% .",
    "the offset is unimportant since the fitting routine will remove uncertainty associated with that .",
    "however , the fluctuations in the standard deviation are important since they measure the differences in the spectrum among agn .",
    "thus , we assign a systematic uncertainty of 1% to the model spectrum . the statistical uncertainty in the sdss spectrum in the region of interest is about 2% .",
    "thus the ratio will have an uncertainty of about 2.2% , and the apparent optical depth should have an uncertainty of about the same value . based on the number of counts in the mdm raw spectrum , we estimate a statistical uncertainty of about 1.5% . propagating our estimated 1% uncertainty in the model spectrum",
    "yields an uncertainty in the ratio for the mdm spectrum of about 1.8% .",
    "the results of fitting the 28-sdss - spectra model to the sdss spectrum of fbqs  j1151@xmath13889 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; the other combinations of spectra and model were similar .",
    "the resulting ratio of data to model for the sdss and mdm spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    in principle",
    ", we should also observe * @xmath56 absorption in the sdss spectrum .",
    "but @xmath57 is 79.4 times smaller for that component than that of * @xmath0 , so it is expected to be even weaker than * @xmath15 , where the @xmath57 ratio is 23.3 .",
    "furthermore , the region of the spectrum around 3188 has exceptionally strong and complex emission in it .",
    "in addition , the emission in this region seems to vary from object to object more profoundly than it does around 3889 .",
    "so while there is some suggestion of absorption in this object ( fig .  [ fig4 ] ) , we can not robustly extract an apparent optical depth profile and therefore ignore this line for the rest of the analysis .",
    "we do not see any significant balmer line absorption in these spectra . however , it may be present at low equivalent widths .",
    "we fitted the sdss spectrum in the vicinity of the h@xmath14 emission line with a power law continuum , a lorentzian profile for the balmer line , two templates ( which will be described in leighly et al .  in prep . ) , and the optical depth profile obtained from the * @xmath0 absorption line .",
    "the resulting component was transformed to a ratio as a function of velocity , which could be used to estimate the balmer column density upper limit (  2.8 ) .",
    "the mdm spectral bandpass did not cover h@xmath14 .",
    "the irtf bandpass does ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , but the spectrum had lower signal - to - noise ratio in the vicinity of this line compared with the sdss spectrum .",
    "therefore , we use the limit obtained from the sdss spectrum henceforth .",
    "h&k absorption lines are visible in the optical spectra .",
    "there are two relatively narrow ( @xmath58 fwhm ) features that peak at @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "both sets of features lie redward of the * absorption .",
    "these two features have low apparent optical depth and are a challenge to analyze .",
    "we begin with the ratio of continuum to model derived in  2.4 for the mdm and sdss spectra obtained using the two models for the emission discussed in  2.4 .",
    "the mdm and sdss profiles appear consistent , so we average the ratios for each model , leaving us with two spectra .",
    "we extract the apparent optical depths from both and display the results for the 28-spectrum model in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] .    is a lithium - like ion and like other resonance transitions in lithium - like atoms , the @xmath57 for the 3934 component is about 2 times that of @xmath57 for the 3969 ( actually equal to 2.05 ) .",
    "we found that the apparent optical depths shown in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] appear to have a ratio of 2:1 , and indeed , if we double the apparent optical depth of the 3969 component ( dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) we find a good correspondence with the apparent optical depth of the 3934 component ( solid line ) .",
    "this implies that partial covering is not important for these lines and that they are not saturated .",
    "indeed , if we use the apparent optical depth profiles to estimate the column density of ca@xmath16 ions , we find that the measured column density from the two lines among the two spectra ranges between @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "these estimates are consistent , given the uncertainties on the ratio spectra .",
    "we take the mean of these estimates ( @xmath63 ) to be the column density of the ca@xmath16 ions .",
    "we believe that this absorption arises in different gas than the * absorption .",
    "first , the * absorption profile is much broader ; had that broad profile been present in the lines , the 3969 component would have severely altered the 3934 component , as these two lines are separated by only @xmath64 . likewise , the 3934 component would have altered the low velocity region of the * line , and strong absorption would have been seen between the * @xmath15 and the @xmath65 lines ( separated by @xmath66 ) .",
    "these features are not seen .",
    "in addition , the _ cloudy _ simulations discussed in  3.1 for the relatively high - ionization * lines do not produce significant ca@xmath16 column density .",
    "the highest log column density predicted is @xmath67 , a factor of five too low ; the highest column densities are found at the lowest ionization parameters . generally speaking ,",

    "as an interesting combination of the above , @xcite propose that different models may be appropriate for different regions of the outflow .",

    "a difficulty is that for high column densities , the transmitted continuum is attenuated significantly by thompson scattering .",

    "above we computed the radius of the wind from the density and the ionization parameter used in the _ cloudy _ modeling .",
    "this is the radius at which the wind has reached its observed velocity and is absorbing the continuum , and so this value would be somewhat larger than the launch radius .",
    "@xcite point out that a general characteristic of radiation - driven winds is that most of the acceleration occurs on a length scale comparable to the starting radius .",
    "therefore , for a rough estimate , we use a launch radius that is half the radius of the absorbing wind derived from the _ cloudy _ simulations .",

    "although most of parameter space is characterized by an outflow , the maximum velocity ( @xmath211 ) is almost a factor of two below the terminal velocity observed in this object .",
    "still , that we can attain high positive velocities in this object is perhaps not surprising as it is radiating at a large fraction of the eddington limit .",
    "could this outflow be a disk wind ?",
    "it does not seem likely that it is .",
    "the disk wind model predicts acceleration to @xmath212 at about @xmath213 from the central engine in a @xmath214 black hole @xcite .",
    "our photoionization modeling results show that the minimum radius predicted in our parameter space is about 1 parsec for the models with the highest density , out to hundreds of parsecs for lower density models .",
    "the distances then range from 10 to thousands of times larger than the disk wind radius .",
    "the above estimate does not take into account the fact that the opacity due to a single line is enhanced by the velocity gradient in an optically - thin outflowing gas .",

    "working through the approximations given above , we find : @xmath234    this equation shows that larger column densities require larger region sizes to accelerate all the gas to the terminal velocity .",
    "the terminal velocity appears on the bottom of the equation as it was originally part of @xmath229 , the differential expansion rate .",
    "the region size has to be larger for smaller differential expansion rates in order to attain the same terminal velocity .",
    "the log of the ratio of the region size to the radius where the absorption occurs is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig16 ] .",
    "this shows that at densities lower than @xmath235 , the flow is unphysical since the region size is larger than the absorption radius .",
    "this happens because low density flows occur at larger radii , and at a large radius the flux is low , so a large equivalent electron optical depth scale is needed to counteract the low flux and accelerate the flow to the observed terminal velocity .",
    "the equivalent electron optical depth scale is linearly dependent on @xmath225 .",

    "if we now compare with previous results from @xcite , we find that fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 has an absorbing region relatively close to the central engine , a higher than average column density , a relatively high kinetic luminosity , but a relatively low mass outflow rate .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the allowed region lies in the area where we expect * @xmath4 to be a useful density diagnostic .",
    "we would also expect to be weak in the uv spectrum as the ionization parameter is now constrained to be between @xmath238 and @xmath239 ( fig .  [ fig12 ] ; middle panel ) .",
    "this analysis assumes that radiative line driving is the acceleration mechanism operating in this balqso ; however , that is the favored acceleration mechanism for the uv absorbing gas . at any rate , it implies that radiative line driving is feasible for higher densities in our parameter space .",
    "lower densities would require an additional acceleration mechanism , perhaps hydromagnetic .",
    "in addition , we have assumed that the flow is radial .",
    "it may be simply crossing our line of sight ; in that case , the terminal velocity would be larger than the observed @xmath240 .",
    "following @xcite , we can compute the size of the absorbers . reviewing their argument ,",
    "since partial covering is significant , the upper limit on the size of the individual absorbing structure is the size of the emitting region .",
    "this is an upper limit since the absorbers can be smaller , and there can be many of them .",
    "we compute the size of the emission region using classical relations from accretion disk theory , namely , for a sum - of - blackbodies accretion disk , @xmath241 we use the black hole mass and accretion rate derived in  4.2 , namely @xmath242 and @xmath243 .",
    "this equation yields a temperature that decreases with radius as @xmath244 .",
    "it has been argued that this radial dependence is too steep ( e.g. , @xcite , who suggests that the index should be 0.57 ) yet may be acceptable for the estimations made here . using this equation , we find that the 3888 and 10830 are emitted at 0.011 and 0.045 pc , respectively .",
    "thus , the 10830 emission region is a factor of 3.9 times larger than the 3888 emission region ; for a flatter temperature dependence of @xmath245 , that difference increases to a factor of 5.8 .",
    "these sizes are comparable to those inferred by @xcite , despite the fact they are examining far uv lines .",
    "the reason for this coincidence is that the black hole mass in their object is much larger .",

    "a comparison of the covering fractions of * and in the same object could be interesting due to the large differences in size of the emitting region ( a factor of 2050 , depending on the radial dependence of the temperature ) .",
    "note that the covering fractions of these lines can be directly compared because the gas presents the same optical depth in these lines ( fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] ) ; as discussed by @xcite , lines that have higher optical depths may have naturally higher covering fractions .",
    "it is possible that the swarm of small clouds may completely cover the 1121 emitting region , but not cover the entire 10830 emitting region .",
    "if this were the case , the covering fraction would be different .",
    "high - column - density outflows are of great interest in balqsos . for radiative acceleration models , the force multiplier is predicted generally to decline with column density ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "so high - column flows place the most stringent constraints on radiative acceleration models .",
    "in addition , the kinetic luminosity depends linearly on the column density , so , depending on the velocity and radius , these outflows may have the largest kinetic luminosities , thus placing the most stringent constraints in general on outflow - acceleration models .",
    "the study of balqsos underwent a paradigm shift about 15 years ago .",
    "previously , it was thought that the absorber completely covered the continuum , and column densities could be measured directly from the troughs .",
    "but the observation of strong in some objects was puzzling , given that the solar abundance of phosphorus is about 765 times lower than that of carbon .",
    "this conundrum was resolved with the realization that the column densities were much larger than previously thought , but the troughs are not black because the absorber only partially covers the continuum source @xcite .",
    "the low abundance of phosphorus means that lines will be present only when the column densities are high .",
    "thus , is a good probe of high - column outflows .",
    "but there is a practical problem with using to detect high - column outflows in general : the resonance lines are in the far uv ( at 1118 and 1128 ) and shortward of ly@xmath14 .",
    "so low - redshift objects must be observed from space , while in high - redshift objects , when is shifted in to the optical bandpass ( for redshifts larger than @xmath249 ) , can be obscured by ly@xmath14 forest absorption .",
    "we propose that * is an equally effective probe of high column densities in balqsos .",
    "we discuss the situation analytically first , and then investigate using simulations .",
    "as shown in @xcite , the optical depth is a function of @xmath250 , where @xmath75 and @xmath251 are the wavelength and the the oscillator strength of the transition , respectively , and @xmath252 is the column density of the relevant ion . for , @xmath57 is 752 ( for both of the resonance transitions for this doublet ) . for * @xmath15 ,",

    "metastable is more monotonic ; for a fixed radiation - bounded slab depth , the number of metastable helium ions increases as the depth of the helium ionization front increases .      as discussed above , * is a valuable probe of high column density in quasars .",
    "moreover , using both the * @xmath96 and * @xmath0 lines , we can solve for the true column density and covering fraction . in this section",
    ", we discuss the range of columns that can be probed using * , and we discuss the prospects of identifying low - reshift balqsos using * .",
    "each quasar absorption line is sensitive to a certain range of column density .",
    "if the column is too low , the absorption line will not be distinguishable from the continuum .",
    "if the column is too high , the absorption line will be saturated .",
    "obviously , the sensitivity will depend on the properties of the transition , through the oscillator strength , and it will depend on the abundance of the ion .",
    "but it will also depend on the properties of the outflow ; in particular , it will depend on the the range of velocity over which the line is spread , @xmath275 .",
    "a low column density is detectable in a narrow line , where @xmath275 is small , while absorption spread over a large range of velocity would be indistinguishable from the continuum .",
    "the sensitivity depends on the data properties , i.e. , signal - to - noise ratio , obviously , with this factor being more important for weak lines .",
    "in addition , in some cases , there is systematic uncertainty , such as the uncertainty in defining the continuum .",
    "we explore the sensitivity of the * lines using simulations .",
    "we use the optical depth profile as a function of velocity obtained from the infrared spectrum .",
    "furthermore , we use this for both lines , that is , we ignore velocity dependence of the optical depth and covering fraction .",
    "we smooth the profile slightly using the function mentioned in  2.1 .",
    "we investigate the region around the 3889 and 10830 lines in velocity space .",
    "we add gaussian noise to the initial ratio of observed to continuum ( equal to 1 ) so that the resulting signal - to - noise ratio is 150",
    ". clearly , there will be sensitivity dependence on the signal - to - noise ratio , but since we are more interested in the characteristics of the lines , we do not explore that dependence here .",
    "we investigate log * column densities between 14.0 and 17.0 .",
    "as discussed above , this corresponds to approximate log hydrogen column densities of 20.2523.25 .",
    "we emphasize again that the results depend on the absorption profile assumed here to have @xmath276 .",
    "we also investigate a range of covering fractions between 0.1 and 0.9 . for each input column density of * , we scale the optical depth profile appropriately to produce the desired column density . then , for each input covering fraction , and using equations 3 and 4 from @xcite , we simulate the observed ratio of absorbed to continuum spectra for both the 3889 region and the 10830 region .",
    "finally , we fit the two resulting simulated ratios with the partial covering model using the technique discussed in  2.8 . for each combination of parameters ,",
    "we run 10 simulations and plot the mean .    as discussed qualitatively above",
    ", metastable helium is a valuable probe of high column densities because helium in this state is relatively rare in the gas . in that way ,",
    "metastable helium absorption is similar to p@xmath253 absorption .",
    "but the * @xmath0 and * @xmath15 lines have another unique property : the high @xmath57 ratio of 23.3 .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath11 lines , like other lithium - like ions , have a @xmath57 ratio of 2",
    ". what effect does the @xmath57 ratio have on the sensitivity ? to explore this question , we do another set of simulations in which @xmath7 for the 3889 line is a factor of two lower than @xmath7 for the 10830 line , instead of the normal case where the ratio is 23.3 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig18][fig21 ] .",
    "we plot the measured properties as a function of the input parameters .",
    "we first plot the number of points retained in fig .",
    "[ fig18 ] .",
    "the optical depth profile had 69 points , and as noted in  2.8 , the software removes unphysical points where @xmath95 is not obeyed .",
    "we see that the number of points retained is lower for the lowest and highest column densities .",
    "this makes sense for the lowest column densities , since in that case , the optical depth of both lines is low , and it is more likely that a fluctuation due to noise will cause a point to become unphysical . at highest column densities ,",
    "the lines become saturated , and the ratio of the observed to continuum looks the same for both lines . again , in this case , is it likely that a fluctuation due to noise will cause a point to become unphysical .",
    "the number of points retained drops less rapidly for @xmath277 as the low value of the oscillator strength of the 3889 line means that it is not saturated until the column density becomes very high .",
    "next , we plot the measured covering fraction and column density from the partial covering model in fig .",
    "[ fig19 ] .",
    "the measured covering fraction and column density is consistent with the input for intermediate @xmath278 * column densities for both sets of simulations . for lower column densities ,",
    "the measured covering fraction is consistently low , while the column density is consistently high . at lower column densities ,",
    "the weaker line becomes indistinguishable from the continuum , and unphysical points are dropped .",
    "points are deemed physical if there is a downward fluctuation in the 10830 component , and an upward fluctuation in 3889 .",
    "this situation looks the same as a higher column and a lower covering fraction . for the highest column densities ,",
    "the measured column is consistent with the input for the @xmath7 ratio @xmath279 case , while it is consistently underestimated for the @xmath57 ratio @xmath280 case .",
    "this is because at high column densities , both lines become saturated when @xmath57 ratio@xmath280 .",
    "how would we fare if we had only one of the two * lines ?",
    "[ fig20 ] shows the apparent column densities measured from the 10830  line and the 3889 lines separately .",
    "we find that the column density is uniformly less than the observed , as expected .",
    "the discrepancy is less for high covering fractions ; the presence of significant partial covering , i.e. , small values of the covering fraction , makes the optical depth look too low .",
    "there is also a saturation of column at high column densities for a given covering fraction .",
    "this is due to saturation of the lines .",
    "the 3889 line ( with @xmath57 ratio @xmath279 ) performs the best at high column densities because the low oscillator strength of this line prevents it from becoming saturated .",
    "the apparent column density is lower than the input for small values of the covering fraction , for the same reason as above : low values of the covering fraction make the apparent optical depth low .    finally , in fig .  [ fig21 ]",
    "we plot the difference between the log of the measured average column density and the log of the input average column density .",
    "recall that the average column density for the partial covering model is the product of the covering fraction and the column density .",
    "this is the relevant parameter for the photoionization and dynamical modeling . for smaller column densities ,",
    "the accuracy is better for larger covering fractions ; for smaller covering fractions , the observed column is overestimated but by less than an order of magnitude .",
    "more importantly , this plot shows that the average column is accurately reproduced for input log * column densities larger than @xmath281 when the @xmath57 ratio @xmath279 . for a @xmath57 ratio @xmath280 ,",
    "both lines become saturated at high column densities , and the input column density is estimated to be too low by an order of magnitude .    in summary , these simulations show that while there is some bias in measuring parameters at low column density ( which is not surprising since as the lines become indistinguishable from the continuum ) , the large @xmath57 ratio @xmath279 for @xmath0 and @xmath15 makes it superior for measuring high column densities .",
    "basically , the large ratio gives these lines an increased dynamic range for measuring high column densities .",
    "an important point , though , is that the values in these simulations apply for the optical depth profile derived for @xmath57 for fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 ; the columns measurable will vary depending on the distribution of column over velocity , @xmath282 .      in this paper , we report the discovery of the first * @xmath0 broad absorption line quasar .",

    "how can we identify objects with * @xmath15 ? as discussed in  2.4 , it can be difficult as it is generally a weak line that can be confused with strong emission .",
    "one way is to look at objects that have both and * @xmath15 in the bandpass .",

    "@xmath0 limits us to low redshift objects .",
    "if we observe * @xmath15 in the optical band , we will observe the 10830 component in the 0.8@xmath284 short - wavelength band ; then , we are limited to objects with redshifts less than 1.2 .",
    "but these nearby objects may be quite interesting .",
    "only a handful of low - redshift balqsos are known ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "many of these were discovered serendipitously ; for example , they were observed because they are pg quasars , or because they have weak [ ] in their optical spectra @xcite .",
    "these low - redshift objects have lower luminosities than the sdss and lbqs balqsos ( e.g. , fig .  7 in",
    "* ) , and so they define the low-@xmath46 end of the correlation between @xmath46 and luminosity .",
    "that region of the plot is rather sparsely populated , but it may be important in our understanding of outflows in agn as it bridges the very low velocity outflows seen in seyfert galaxies ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the high velocity balqsos beyond @xmath285 .",
    "fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 is a luminous object ; for @xcite s cosmology , the dereddened 3000 @xmath286 is 45.9 ( without the reddening correction , @xmath287 ; fig .  [ fig13 ] ) .",
    "from @xcite we see that lower luminosity objects of interest should have @xmath288 , or greater than 2 magnitudes fainter than fbqs  j1151@xmath13822 .",

    "the procedure was straightforward for the 10830 line because the ir continuum is fairly simple .",

    "this result implies that the absorber does not fully cover the source .",
    "since the two transitions have the same lower ( metastable ) level , we can solve two - parameter inhomogeneous covering models as a function of velocity .",

    "the hydrogen @xmath108 limit depends on the details of the population of the @xmath292 and the @xmath293 states ; assuming that the @xmath293 metastable state was solely populated yielded an upper limit of log hydrogen @xmath108 column of 13.5 . *",

    "this simply shows that the depth of the p@xmath253 region shifts in the gas in the same way as the he@xmath300 region as a function of sed .",
    "thus , there appears to be little relative dependence on spectral energy distribution between these two lines .",
    "the metallicity of the gas will also influence the results .",
    "we briefly investigate the effect of metallicity by running a grid of models with the @xcite agn kirk continuum and a metallicity five times that of solar ( @xmath301 ) . as discussed in (",
    "* table 2 ) , this means that each metal element is five times more prevalent with respect to hydrogen than at solar abundance , with the exception of nitrogen , which because of the secondary production process is 25 times more abundant than at solar metallicity . in addition , helium is enhanced by a factor of 1.29 .",
    "notable differences were seen between the @xmath301 metallicity results and the solar metallicity results presented in  3.1 .",
    "first , there is a difference in the hydrogen column density required to produce the observed metastable helium column density , namely , the allowable solutions extend to lower ionization parameters , down to @xmath302 versus @xmath2 for solar metallicity . at these lower ionization parameters ,",
    "we expect lower ionization species to be more prominent ; that could potentially be recognized in the uv spectrum ( see below ;  3.2.2 ) .",
    "one might imagine that the column densities from the higher metallicity grid might differ from the solar metallicity grid by a constant factor reflecting the abundance differences .",
    "however , the presence of enhanced metals changes the cooling in the gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and so the results are not so simple .",
    "we show the difference in the log column between the @xmath301 and the @xmath303 results in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , both for the total hydrogen column and the p@xmath253 column density .",
    "we include only regions of parameter space were both solutions exist .    for the total hydrogen density , we see that the difference in the log of the column density is negative in all cases .",
    "this means that the column required is lower in the @xmath301 case , as expected .",
    "as mentioned above , in the @xmath301 experiment , the abundance of helium is enhanced by a factor of 1.29 .",
    "this corresponds to a difference in log of 0.11 .",
    "we observe a much larger range of differences , with the largest difference up to almost @xmath304 for lower densities .",
    "we suspect this is a consequence of enhanced cooling at low densities due to the higher metallicity .",
    "as mentioned above , the metastable state is populated by recombination from he@xmath305 and depopulated chiefly by collisions @xcite .",
    "when the temperature is lower , a larger fraction remains in the metastable state .",
    "so a smaller total hydrogen column is necessary to attain the required column of * .",
    "the effect is enhanced at low densities where the gas generally has more trouble cooling than it does at higher densities .    for p@xmath253",
    ", we see that the difference is positive in all cases .",
    "this means that there are more p@xmath253 at @xmath301 than at solar metallicity , as expected .",
    "but at @xmath301 , the number of phosphorus atoms is larger by a factor of five , while the enhancement in the number of p@xmath253 reaches that value only at the highest ionization parameters .",
    "part of the difference between the naive expectation and the _ cloudy _ results is caused by the lower hydrogen column density .",
    "the remainder of the difference may again be due to enhanced cooling at higher metallicities ; as discussed by @xcite , an increase in the metal abundance leads to enhanced cooling and nearly constant flux ratios with respect to e.g. , ly@xmath14 .",
    "this effect is most prominent at low ionization parameter where there are plenty of species to cool the gas . at high ionization parameter ,",
    "the number of lines accessible decreases , and the difference in cooling between the @xmath303 and @xmath301 cases decreases .",
    "in the _ cloudy _ simulations presented in  3.1 , we assumed that the slab of gas was stationary .",
    "this is probably not a realistic model for the data given that we are modeling an outflow .",
    "the presence of a differential velocity field can influence the radiative transfer of ly@xmath14 . in a stationary slab and at high densities",
    ", this line can be trapped .",
    "that will increase the rate of pumping of into @xmath108 , and it may increase the rate of photoionization of * . in this section , we explore the effects of a differential velocity field by including turbulence in the _ cloudy _ modeling .",
    "initially , we include @xmath306 in the model .",
    "we found that the execution time increased with @xmath307 , so we chose this value to start with .",
    "as discussed in  3.1 , we ran models using a large column density , used the output to determine the column density required to produce the * column density measured from the data , then ran the models again .",
    "the grid sampled a slightly smaller range of ionization parameter than in  3.1 , as _ cloudy _ crashed for the highest ionization parameters where @xmath308 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig22 ] . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , we see that the column densities are nearly the same , as well as the ionization constraint on the allowed parameter space . but higher densities are allowed , up to @xmath309 for @xmath310 .",
    "this happens because as @xmath307 increases , ly@xmath14 is less trapped , so the column density of in @xmath108 decreases , and so the upper limit on in @xmath108 is attained at higher densities .",
    "we note that we see no evidence for destruction of * by ly@xmath14 .",
    "if that were important , we would expect an increase in required hydrogen column at high densities , because we would have to go deeper into the gas to attain sufficient * .",
