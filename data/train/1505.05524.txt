    "radiation heat waves play important roles in many high energy density physics ( hedp ) phenomena . in particular",
    ", they have major importance in inertial confinement fusion ( icf ) and in astrophysical and laboratory plasma  @xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "laser beams deliver energy to the interior of a high - z hohlraum that is converted into x - rays .",
    "re - emission and further absorption of the x - rays in the cavity walls helps achieving a thermal source which acts as the drive for the experiments .",
    "the radiation is absorbed and contained within the cavity in a form of a radiative heat wave propagating through the hohlraum walls .",
    "it is therefore important to understand this phenomena , as a key to interpreting the experiments and the numerical simulations .",
    "the mechanism of the radiative heat waves is as follows : we consider a semi - infinite wall , whose boundary is held at a high temperature .",
    "usually , the temperature and density in this regime are such that the radiation energy is negligible compared to the matter energy , but the radiation heat flux is the dominant energy transport mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the hot boundary radiates and heats the rest of the wall via photon transport . in the optically thick limit , a diffusive heat wave , characterized by a sharp temperature rise , propagates through the wall .",
    "if the wave propagates much faster than the speed of sound , hydrodynamic motion is negligible in the problem , and the wave is considered to be  supersonic \" ( fig .",
    "[ plots_basic](a ) ) . if , however , the wave propagates slower than the speed of sound , the high matter pressure causes ablation of matter in the opposing direction of the heat wave .",
    "in addition , the heat wave is overtaken by a shock wave ( fig .",
    "[ plots_basic](b ) ) , generated by the ablation pressure ( from momentum conservation ) .",
    "the nature of the heat wave is temperature and density dependent , and can vary with time , as a supersonic diffusive front decelerates and becomes subsonic if the boundary temperature does nt change by much .",
    "if the temperature rises fast enough , the diffusive front accelerates and becomes more and more supersonic . in this work , we assume that the radiation and matter are in local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) , which means they are strongly coupled .",
    "the first description of heat waves was proposed by marshak  @xcite , who obtained exact solutions for the radiative flow in the supersonic regime , in which hydrodynamic motion is negligible . for the subsonic case , in which hydrodynamics can not be neglected ,",
    "a full self - similar solution combining the ablation region and the shock region can not be proposed for the general case , since the problem is not self - similar altogether .",
    "pakula and sigel  @xcite , obtained self similar solutions of the heat wave in the subsonic case of an infinitely dense wall , thus solving the ablation region only .",
    "hammer and rosen  @xcite proposed new solutions in this region , based on a perturbation theory .",
    "self - similar solutions of the ablative subsonic regime in specific cases were obtained in many other works  @xcite . in particular , garnier et .",
    "@xcite proposed a self - similar solution that includes both the ablative and shock regions , for a specific case that ensures constant density over time ( which is in this particular case , self - similar ) .",
    "these solutions are widely used for obtaining a better understanding of the heat wave phenomenon , evaluating the achieved temperature in icf experiments  @xcite , or modeling hydrodynamical instabilities via linear perturbation amplification technique  @xcite .    however",
    ", none of the previous works provides a full treatment of the shock wave and the ablation - shock interface for the general case . only naive approximations , considering a constant ablation pressure were used to describe the shock region  @xcite .",
    "these approximations are inaccurate in many cases , where the ablation pressure varies significantly over time . in this work ,",
    "we propose a complete solution for both parts of the heat wave .",
    "we solve each part separately , in a self - similar fashion , and find a continuous way to mathematically patch them .",
    "for the ablative region we follow the solution of ref .",
    "@xcite and expand it , finding a relation between the units of the conserved physical quantity and the temporal behavior of the boundary condition .",
    "furthermore , we derive explicit expressions for the heat wave front coordinate and the energy contained within the heat wave , for general boundary conditions . in the shock region",
    ", we obtain a self - similar solution assuming a time - dependent pressure boundary condition .",
    "then , the pressure at the ablation front , as obtained in the ablation region solution , is used as the boundary condition of the shock solution . the full solution is composed of these self - similar solutions .",
    "the results agree with full numerical simulation of the problem .",

    "the lack of perfect agreement between the full solution and the analytic one , may be due to the fact that in early times , the heat front is not subsonic ( and the ablation density is not infinite ) .",

    "the solution was found to be in agreement with numerical simulation ( fig .",
    "[ shock_check ] ) .    finally , we set the resulting @xmath123 and @xmath91 that the ablation heat wave solution yielded , substitute them as input to the shock solution , and patched both solutions at the interface . using this method",
    ", we obtained a full analytic solution to the non self - similar problem , composed of two different solution , each one of them is self - similar by itself and is valid in a different region of the problem .",
    "this simple technique was tested with numerical simulations and was found to be accurate to within @xmath124 .    as mentioned in the introduction",

    "<S> 443 , * 28 * , 232 ( 1985 ) ] , present self - similar solutions for the ablation region alone , since in general , the shock region and the ablation region are not self - similar together . analytic results for both regions were obtained only for the specific case in which the ratio between the ablation front velocity and the shock velocity is constant . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a full analytic solution for the whole problem in general boundary conditions . our solution is composed of two different self - similar solutions , one for each region , that are patched at the heat front . </S>",
    "<S> the ablative region of the heat wave is solved in a manner similar to previous works . </S>",
    "<S> then , the pressure at the front , which is derived from the ablative region solution , is taken as a boundary condition to the shock region , while the other boundary is described by hugoniot relations . </S>",
    "<S> the solution is compared to full numerical simulations in several representative cases . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical and analytic results are found to agree within @xmath0 in the ablation region , and within @xmath1 in the shock region . </S>",
    "<S> this model allows better prediction of the physical behavior of radiation induced shock waves , and can be applied for high energy density physics experiments . </S>"
