    "though discovered in 1951 by jack,@xcite @xmath0-fe@xmath1n@xmath2 ( with crystal structure pictured in figure  [ fig : struct ] ) first drew the attention of the magnetics community in 1972 .",
    "it was then , 20 years later , that kim and takahashi@xcite reported polycrystalline , mixed - phase fe - n films with a saturation magnetization exceeding that of both @xmath6-fe and co@xmath7fe@xmath8 ( @xmath9 a / m ) .",
    "however , it took another 20 years for the result to be reproduced ( and , in fact , surpassed ) by sugita _",
    "et al._@xcite throughout the 1980s and 90s , other measurements of fe@xmath1n@xmath2 thin films were reported that generally did not find this large magnetic moment.@xcite    n@xmath2 , belonging to space group @xmath10 .",
    "we use the pbe - relaxed structure in all calculations with @xmath11  , @xmath12  , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",
    "we will frequently refer to the three inequivalent fe wyckoff sites : @xmath15 ( red ) , @xmath16 ( green ) , and @xmath17 ( blue ) ( the n sites are black ) . ]    concurrently , density - functional theory ( dft ) electronic structure calculations were performed,@xcite finding the moment per fe ion to be modestly increased with respect to bulk bcc fe but far short of the 3.5 @xmath5 reported by sugita _",
    "_ it was shown@xcite that lsda+u@xcite calculations could yield an average moment comparable to that of some experiments ( @xmath18 per fe ) , but the parameters ( @xmath19 , 1.0 , and 1.34 ev on the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 sites , respectively , with @xmath20 ) were obtained via an embedded - cluster method with a small screening constant and were not calculated from first principles . additionally , the @xmath21 parameter is smaller than usually considered appropriate for transition metals ( typically one chooses either an atomic - like @xmath21 of about @xmath22 ev or else a more screened @xmath21 of about 0.6 - 0.7 ev ) .",
    "recently , further experimental evidence for the large magnetization has arisen,@xcite as well as a companion theoretical paper@xcite reporting enlarged fe moments achieved using lsda+u ( using @xmath23 ev for the @xmath15 site , 4.0 ev for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sites , and @xmath21 = @xmath24 ) .",
    "_ motivate their parameters by proposing that the fe sites in the n - fe octahedra form strongly correlated clusters in a metallic fe environment , choosing a small @xmath3 for the ( within their model ) more metallic @xmath15 sites and a large @xmath3 ( chosen to be intermediate between that of feo and fe ) for the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sites .",
    "they suggest that this model is supported by xmcd spectra that show additional features at the fe sites not seen in bcc fe or other fe - n phases.@xcite    in the present work , we perform an extensive search for the proposed large magnetization ; we calculate the hyperfine field at the three fe sites and compare with published mssbauer spectra ; we search for additional energy minima at moments away from the theoretical prediction as a function of tetragonal distortion ; we apply the hse06 hybrid - functional method@xcite and the gw approximation@xcite as implemented in ` vasp`@xcite to @xmath0-fe@xmath1n@xmath2 , testing the two methods on bcc fe to ensure that any enhancement of the moment we obtain is genuine .",
    "further , we compute the effective on - site coulomb interaction ( hubbard @xmath3 ) between localized 3@xmath4 electrons employing the constrained random - phase approximation ( crpa ) @xcite ( as implemented in the ` spex`@xcite extension of the ` fleur`@xcite code ) , allowing us to provide for the first time first - principles predictions for the @xmath3 and @xmath21 parameters",
    ". finally , we present new pbe+u@xcite calculations using these parameters and discuss their implications for existing models .",
    "the hyperfine field calculation and the study of the dependence of the total energy on cell moment ( fixed spin moment or fsm ) and tetragonal distortion was performed using the ` fplo ` code.@xcitewe implemented the full relativistic expression for the hyperfine field @xmath25 as given in ref .   and references therein into ` fplo`@xcite .",
    "note , that here we give the general pre - factor to accomodate for proper units .",
    "@xmath26 are the solutions of the kohn - sham - dirac equation , while @xmath27 , with @xmath28 being the vector of the pauli matrices .",
    "@xmath29 is the direction of the nuclear spin moment .",
    "the wave functions @xmath30 are expanded in local atom centered orbitals in ` fplo ` .",
    "the effective integrand @xmath31 leads to a damping factor for matrix elements between orbitals from different sites , which allows to introduce the approximation that only terms with orbitals belonging to the atom at which the nuclear spins sits will be taken into account .",
    "the scalar relativistic hyperfine fields only contains the fermi contact term , while the full relativistic version contains all terms ( including fermi contact , orbital and spin dipole - nuclear dipole ) , due to the intrinsic 4-component formulation of eq .   and the use of 4-spinors .",
    "a non - relativistic limit of this expression reveals all of the separate terms .",
    "the major contributions come form the @xmath32-orbitals , for whom only the fermi contact term contributes . although , the core states contribute a large amount to the hyperfine field it has been shown@xcite that valence contributions can be sizable .",
    "the core contribution depends on the spin polarization of the core wave functions including the effects of the crystal exchange potential and hence should be influenced and scaled by the local spin moment . in ` fplo ` the semi - core ( fe 3s,3p ) states are treated like valence states .",
    "for this reason we include the valence and semi - core contributions via the onsite approximation as explained above .",
    "the fsm calculation was carried out within the pbe approximation using a @xmath33 @xmath34-point mesh in a linear tetrahedron method with blchl corrections .",
    "our ` vasp ` pbe+u ( using the fully - local double - counting term ) , hse06 and gw calculations used a plane - wave cut - off of 400 ev ( 29.4 ry or 5.42 @xmath35 ) .",
    "the pbe+u ( hse06 and gw ) calculations used an @xmath33 ( @xmath36 ) @xmath37-centered monkhorst - pack @xmath34 mesh ( also using the tetrahedron method with blchl corrections ) , employing a smaller @xmath38 mesh for the exact - exchange sums .",
    "all of our ` vasp ` calculations use the paw@xcite pseudopotentials of kresse and joubert,@xcite and all ` vasp ` moments are calculated within a sphere of radius 1.3   on the fe sites .    to calculate the hubbard @xmath3 parameter",
    "we employ the constrained random - phase approximation ( crpa ) @xcite within the full - potential linearized augmented - plane - wave ( flapw ) method using maximally localized wannier functions ( mlwfs ) .",
    "@xcite the crpa approach offers an efficient way to calculate the effective coulomb interaction @xmath3 and allows to determine individual coulomb matrix elements , e.g. , on - site , off - site , inter - orbital , intra - orbital , and exchange as well as their frequency dependence .",
    "we use the flapw method as implemented in the ` fleur ` code @xcite with the pbe exchange - correlation potential@xcite for ground - state calculations . a dense @xmath39 @xmath40-point grid is used .",
    "the mlwfs are constructed with the ` wannier90 ` code @xcite .",
    "the effective coulomb potential is calculated within the recently developed crpa method @xcite implemented in the ` spex ` code @xcite ( for further technical details see refs .",
    ", , and ) .",
    "we use a @xmath38 @xmath34-point grid in the crpa calculations .    in all calculations",
    "we use the pbe - relaxed structure with @xmath41   and @xmath12   ( except in the fsm survey ) and internal parameters @xmath42 and @xmath14 . as a final note ,",
    "we consider all employed electronic structure schemes ( ` vasp ` , ` fleur ` , ` fplo ` ) to be equivalent with respect to numerical accuracy at the level required in the present study .",
    "the use of three different packages is motivated by the different implementations available in these codes .",
    "the hyperfine field provides a picture of the local magnetic structure that , unlike measurements of the saturation magnetization , does not require accurate estimation of the volume of a sample or its component phases .",
    "mssbauer spectroscopy has been performed in many previous works@xcite , and the hyperfine field has been calculated@xcite from dft .",
    "our calculated @xmath43 ( found along with our calculated fe moments in table  [ tab : bhf ] ) agrees well with these past results ; we find that the fe sites with n nearest - neighbors exhibit approximately the same field ( -23 and -22 t on the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sites ) , while @xmath44 t for the @xmath15 sites .",
    "if we note , as previous authors have,@xcite that dft underestimates the hyperfine field by a substantial , though nearly static , amount ( @xmath45 t in this case ) , then we also find reasonable agreement with some of the experimental reports .",
    "particularly , we agree well with refs . , , and .",
    "although our hyperfine fields agree numerically with those of moriya _",
    "et al._,@xcite they claimed that the largest hyperfine field was to be found in the @xmath17 site , a claim that is difficult to reconcile with the predicted relative magnitudes of the moments and the similar environment of the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sites .",
    "we note , however , that this assignment of the hyperfine fields agrees better with the moments in the recent lsda+u study of ji _",
    "et al._.@xcite we can not offer any new explanation for sugita _ et al .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we have examined the electronic and magnetic structure of @xmath0-fe@xmath1n@xmath2 within pbe , pbe+u , hse06 , and gw . within pbe , we find spin moments and hyperfine fields that agree with past results , and we do not find that any high - magnetization state arises as @xmath46 changes from the experimental value .",
    "we have provided effective coulomb interaction parameters calculated via crpa and have used them in our pbe+u calculations .",
    "we find that pbe+u and hse06 gives average spin moments per fe of 2.71 and 2.86 @xmath5 but also greatly overestimate the moment of bcc fe ( experimentally about 2.2 @xmath5 ) .",
    "gw gives smaller moments , 2.57 - 2.70 @xmath5 per fe , a slight increase over the pbe moment .",
    "g@xmath47w@xmath47 , gw@xmath47 , and gw all overestimate the bcc fe spin moment by different amounts despite their similar predictions for fe@xmath1n@xmath2 , with g@xmath47w@xmath47 giving the most reasonable bcc fe moment due to its close dependence on the pbe result . in all cases , we find that the @xmath16 and @xmath17 sites have smaller moments than that on the @xmath15 site",
    ".    we have also presented calculations of the orbital moment on the fe sites obtained within pbe , pbe+opc , pbe+u , and g@xmath47w@xmath47 .",
    "we find that the orbital moment is not completely quenched and may add 0.1  0.2 @xmath5 to the average total moment per fe , a small increase over bcc fe .    in order to evaluate the varying results found above",
    ", one must understand the purposes of and approximations inherent in the methods presented .",
    "in addition to the shortcomings of the mean - field - like treatment of correlations within pbe+u , there are two notable avenues for error in this method : the need to choose the @xmath3 and @xmath21 parameters and the lack of _ a priori _ justification for the double - counting corrections .",
    "dependence on the choice of interaction parameters is not a fundamental problem and can be alleviated as we have done here by computing them through some appropriate first - principles method .",
    "the choice between the fll or amf double - counting corrections , while straightforward when treating insulators , can be less obvious in semi - localized magnetic systems , and furthermore no method exists for determining the exact form of the correction .",
    "the hybrid functional method s dependence on parameters is fundamental to the approach , although it is mitigated somewhat by the use of predetermined parameters such as in hse06 .",
    "however , these parameters were primarily chosen to produce reasonable band gaps and may need to be altered to properly treat metallic systems . in principle , the gw approximation should be the most accurate of those presented here .",
    "the g@xmath47w@xmath47 and gw@xmath47 methods maintain good contact with the pbe results while incorporating first - order exchange and correlation effects .",
    "however , some care must still be taken ; we have shown that the results do depend on which electrons are treated as valence and which are absorbed into the core pseudopotential .",
    "lastly , we note the need for additional , repeatable experiments that probe the electronic structure of the material in order to provide a better basis for comparison with theory .",
