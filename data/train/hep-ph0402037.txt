    "recently , new models have been proposed as possible solutions to the hierarchy problem of the standard model .",
    "this problem , also referred to as the fine - tuning problem , is most easily phrased as follows .",
    "if radiative corrections to the higgs mass are computed using an ultra - violet cut off @xmath8 , the resulting value of the higgs mass is of order @xmath8 unless there is a very delicate cancellation .",
    "the `` little higgs '' models @xcite provide just enough new physics to generate cancellations and preserve a light higgs boson while raising the ultra - violet cut off to a scale of several tens of tev where constraints on new particles from existing experiments are very weak . in the standard model ,",
    "there are three contributions to radiative corrections to the higgs mass that dominate the hierarchy problem . in order of importance",
    "they are the top quark , the electro - weak gauge bosons , and the higgs itself . if the loop integrals are cut off at scale @xmath9 tev , these corrections are :    * from the top loop @xmath10 ; * from the @xmath11 loops @xmath12 ; * from the higgs loop @xmath13 .",
    "the `` little higgs '' models implement the idea that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson @xcite .",
    "they are constructed by embedding the standard model inside a larger group with an enlarged symmetry .",
    "the larger symmetry is then broken at some high scale @xmath14 , so that the higgs mass is protected from radiative corrections at one loop that are dependent quadratically on @xmath15 . from a phenomenological point of view",
    ", the effect of this symmetry is to require the existence of new particles whose couplings ensure that the large contributions to the higgs mass are canceled .",
    "there must be three types of new particles corresponding to the three contributions listed above . in this paper",
    "we study the observability , using the atlas detector at the lhc , of these new particles . for definiteness we will use the `` littlest higgs '' model @xcite although many of our results can be reinterpreted in other models . in this model , a new charge 2/3 quark , @xmath16 , which is an electroweak singlet is predicted .",
    "it mixes with the top quark and decays via this mixing to @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 final states .",
    "since this particle is canceling the largest contribution to the higgs mass , its mass can not be too large or the fine tuning problem will reappear : @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "the model is based on an extended gauge group containing the gauged subgroup @xmath21\\otimes [ su(2)_2\\otimes u(1)_2]$ ] which itself implies , in addition to the @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 of the standard model , four new gauge bosons @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "since these new gauge bosons are canceling the contributions from @xmath11 loops , their masses are less strongly constrained : @xmath28 .",
    "the model also predicts new higgs particles forming an @xmath29 triplet ( @xmath30 ) which contains a doubly charged state .",
    "as the higgs contribution to the fine - tuning problem is the smallest , these masses are the least constrained : @xmath31 tev .",
    "precision electroweak data severely constrain the model considered here @xcite .",
    "we will not take these constraints into account as they can be avoided in other models whose lhc phenomenology is similar to the one we consider @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we discuss the channels available for the discovery and measurement of the properties of the @xmath16 quark in the next section .",
    "we then discuss the new gauge bosons and the doubly charged higgs boson and finally we draw some conclusions regarding the lhc sensitivity to little higgs models .",
    "specific masses are chosen for the the simulations shown below .",
    "our main purpose is to assess the potential of atlas for the little higgs model , so we have chosen masses that are rather large as observation is more difficult in these cases due to the smaller event rates . in a few cases where",
    "we were concerned that the signal to background ratio might get worse with reduced masses , we show a lower mass case to allay this concern .",
    "a higgs mass of 120 gev was assumed and we comment on the effect of this choice in the conclusion .",
    "we further assume that the higgs boson has been discovered and that its mass is known .",
    "pythia 6.203 @xcite with suitably normalized rates was used to generate events which were passed through the atlas fast simulation@xcite which provides a parametrized response of the atlas detector to jets , electrons , muons , isolated photons and missing transverse energy .",
    "this fast simulation has been validated using a large number of studies @xcite where it was compared with , and adjusted to agree with , the results of a full , geant based , simulation @xcite .",
    "the performance for high luminosity environment is assumed .",
    "the fast simulation provides a standard definition of isolated leptons and photons that is used throughout . using these definitions , fake electrons arising from misidentified jets are negligible for our purposes .",
    "jets are reconstructed using a cone algorithm with a cone of size @xmath32 .",
    "performance for the high luminosity ( @xmath33 @xmath34 sec@xmath35 is assumed .",
    "there is one case , that of identifying jets containing @xmath36hadrons ( @xmath36tagging ) , where the validation was in a kinematic range different from that needed in this study . in this case , a full simulation was performed and its results used to reparametrize the tagging efficiency and the rejection against non@xmath37 jets used in fast simulation .",
    "( see details in section  3.3 . )",
    "the event selections are based on the characteristics of the signal being searched for , and are such that they will pass the atlas trigger criteria .",
    "the most important triggers arise from the isolated leptons , jets or photons present in the signal .",
    "these event selections exploit the experience gained in devising the stratgies for other new physics searches @xcite .",
    "the selections have not been optimized in detail for the particular cases under study . in some cases ,",
    "the cuts have been varied when the particle masses were changed ; for example raising the threshold on particular physics objects as the mass of the new particle increases .",
    "it is not claimed that the event selections are optimal .",
    "detailed optimization is not wise at this stage due to uncertainties in the background estimates .",
    "pythia was also use for simulation of the backgrounds . in a few cases ,",
    "discussed explicitly below , other event generators were used if the backgrounds are needed in regions of phase space where pythia is known to be less reliable ( mainly for processes with large numbers of well - separated jets ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties in the level of the backgrounds are , in many cases , difficult to estimate . since we are only interested in the observability of the signals , but are not , at this stage , attempting to evaluate the precision with which cross - sections can be measured , these uncertainties are not expected to affect significantly the results .",
    "indeed , in most cases , the signals appear as clear peaks above a smooth background .",
    "the precision with which masses can be measured will ultimately depend on the calibration of the detector .",
    "previous studies can be consulted for a discussion of these issues @xcite .",
    "the @xmath16 quark can be produced at the lhc via two mechanisms : qcd production via the processes @xmath38 and @xmath39 which depend only on the mass of @xmath16 ; and production via @xmath22 exchange @xmath40 which leads to a single @xmath16 in the final state and therefore falls off much more slowly as @xmath41 increases .",
    "this latter process depends on the model parameters and , in particular , upon the mixing of the @xmath16 with the conventional top quark .",
    "the yukawa couplings of the new @xmath16 are given by two constants @xmath42 and @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the standard model higgs doublet , @xmath46 is a doublet containing the left - handed top and bottom quarks ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 ) , and @xmath49 is the right - handed top quark ; ( for details see @xcite whose notation is followed here ) .",
    "the physical top quark mass eigenstate is a mixture of @xmath50 and @xmath16 .",
    "these couplings contain three parameters @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath51 that determine the masses of @xmath16 and the top quark as well as their mixings .",
    "two of the parameters can be reinterpreted as the top mass and the @xmath16 mass .",
    "the third can then be taken to be @xmath52 .",
    "this determines the mixings and hence the coupling strength @xmath53 which controls the production rate via the @xmath40 process .",
    "the production rates are shown in figure [ han1 ] from @xcite .",
    "it can be seen that single production dominates for masses above 700 gev . as we expect that we are sensitive to masses larger than this , we consider only the single production process in what follows .",
    "we assume the following cross - sections : for @xmath54 tev , @xmath55 @xmath56 for @xmath57 .",
    "events generated using pythia were normalized to these values .",
    "the decay rates of @xmath16 are as follows @xmath58 with @xmath59 implying that @xmath16 is a narrow resonance .",
    "the last of these decays would be expected for a charged 2/3 4@xmath60 generation quark ; the first two are special to the `` little higgs model '' .",
