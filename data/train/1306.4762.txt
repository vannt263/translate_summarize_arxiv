    "in 1744 , euler introduced the analytic formula @xmath0 for calculating the critical buckling load of a perfect straight column of elastica subject to an axial end - load with the pinned - pinned boundary conditions . in this formula",
    ", @xmath1 denotes the young s modulus of the material , @xmath2 the area moment of inertia , and @xmath3 the length of the straight column .",
    "the euler s formula is limited to applications for elastic columns . for a prior history to the theory of elastic stability of columns ,",
    "see @xcite . in 1859",
    ", kirchhoff extended the theory to geometrically non - linear large deflections and provided a solution of the deflection curve in terms of elliptic integrals . in around 1889 , engesser ( @xcite ) presented the tangent modulus critical buckling load formula @xmath4 , replacing the young s modulus by the tangent modulus @xmath5 defined as the slope of the stress - strain curve at the start of the plastic strain range , or at the elastic yield point . in 1895 , jasinsky ( @xcite ) noted a problem with engesser s theory , which in 1898 , engesser himself corrected ( @xcite ) by modifying his tangent modulus theory ( or double modulus theory ) , and introducing the euler - engesser reduced modulus load . assuming that the neutral axis passes through the centroid , it has a simple form : @xmath6 for @xmath7 and where @xmath8 and @xmath9 represent the area moments of inertia relative to the compressed portion and the strain reversed portions of the cross section at the buckling state . for a detailed description of the reduced modulus load and the terms used here see ,",
    "e.g. , @xcite . around that time",
    ", various attempts were made to extend euler s result for various elastic and/or inelastic columns .",
    "for example , engesser ( 1891 ) and haringx ( 1948 - 49 ) each derived a euler - type load formula by taking into account the influence of transverse shearing force .",
    "these formulae were presented by timoshenko and gere ( 1961 ) in @xcite . for details , also see @xcite .    for a modern account of the history of stability of columns , names of people who made important contributions to the buckling analysis of beam columns , and the associated bifurcation theory ,",
    "see @xcite . in particular , the seminal work of j. w. hutchinson @xcite provides technical and historical details of the theory of plastic buckling of columns under axial compression and the associated bifurcation theory . to this day , many studies of stability of various columns are still based on euler s and engesser s assumptions . furthermore , several formulas of the euler - type are available in the literature for nonlinear beam columns .",
    "also , the development of numerical methods , such as the finite element and finite volume methods , along with the development of high - speed computers , have allowed researchers to arrive at better approximations of buckling solutions , specially for nonlinear columns . among other numerical methods ,",
    "the incremental methods are frequently used to linearize the nonlinear equations and the nonlinear solutions are approximated by the linear ones with refined linear steps .",
    "the euler - type formulas can be used successfully at each linear substep for linear materials undergoing large deformations or even for nonlinear materials .",
    "one of the most popular methods is the rik s method .",
    "however , the method is time consuming and computationally expensive .",
    "the unconverged solution is used to indicate that the column is unable to carry any more load and buckling has occurred .",
    "the load applied to the column in the last converged step previous to the unconverged solution is then considered as the critical buckling load of the column .",
    "however , like the rik s method , most of these methods are performed under the assumption that the column is not perfectly straight . in most nonlinear finite element buckling analysis ,",
    "the standard procedure is to initiate a small deformation on the column and then incrementally increase the magnitude of the load until a yield criteria is reached for a new stress - strain relationship . at this point",
    ", buckling is said to have occurred .",
    "therefore , these methods of nonlinear buckling analysis are , in essence , the regular stress analysis for imperfect columns and the solutions are fundamentally different from buckling of a perfect column .",
    "euler s critical load formula states clearly that even perfect elastic columns buckle . for additional buckling analysis and various classical euler - type formulas for critical loads of elastic and plastic columns , see ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , many steel - column design manuals are written by using euler - type formulae as the basic design guides due to their simplicity and convenience ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . therefore , obtaining analytic formulae for critical buckling loads of inelastic columns remains very important .    in this work",
    ", we provide critical buckling load and mode formulae for some perfect columns of a large class of work - hardening metals subject to three sets of boundary conditions .",
    "the nonlinear material properties are given by the hollomon s stress - strain equation @xcite @xmath10 where the material is assumed to be isotropic . in ( [ eq : h ] ) , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are , respectively , the true stress and true strain defined in the classical theory of elasticity and plasticity , @xmath13 is the bulk modulus , and @xmath14 the hardening index .",
    "the hollomon s materials are also referred to as ludwik power law materials and the true stress and true strain are referred to as cauchy stress and logarithmic plastic strain , see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the novel critical buckling loads derived in this paper can be used to help designers of work - hardening columns determine more precisely the criteria for stability of columns made of hollomon materials .",
    "these results can be useful for a variety of applications in the design of oil and gas pipelines @xcite , transportation vehicles ; such as airplanes , automobiles , ships ( @xcite,@xcite ) and earthquake - proof infrastructure made of high - strength metal columns .",
    "one of the boundary conditions we will examine in this paper , are the pinned - pinned boundary conditions ( see ( [ eq : bc])i ) below ) . in this case , our extension of the euler critical load formula will be given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 denotes the generalized area moment of inertia and @xmath17 .",
    "notice that this formula reduces to euler s formula when @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , the corresponding buckling mode will be presented in terms of a generalized trigonometric sine function to be introduced in section 2 . for deriving the critical load formulae",

    "the derivation of ( [ eq : prob ] ) can be carried out by the standard euler s assumption that the cross section of a column remains perpendicular to the axis at the deformed equilibrium state .",

    "ss ] , we construct a solution to ( [ eq : probscaled ] ) with sign - changing curvature under the ss setting ( [ eq : bc2])iii ) . although the bvp ( [ eq : probscaled])-([eq : bc2])iii ) may be physically plausible for columns with large cross - sections supported by rollers fixed to the ends of the columns , it is mainly considered here to demonstrate how formulas for solutions satisfying other boundary conditions may be derived through a rather intuitive approach . in section [ sec : cp ] , we introduce simple criteria that allows us to write an equation relating our critical loads with the corresponding euler - engesser s reduced modulus load .",
    "even though the comparison will be done for the case of pp boundary conditions only , a similar argument extends to other cases .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : ex ] we compute critical loads for beams of several well - known materials satisfying the pp boundary conditions and with either circular or rectangular cross - sections .",
    "these results are then compared to the euler - engesser s reduced modulus loads with the strain yield value @xmath34 .",
