    "many nonlinear phenomena appearing in physics are described by first - order quasilinear systems in both their hyperbolic and elliptic regions .",
    "these systems have been mostly studied in the case of two independent variables . however , until now , no satisfactory complete theory exists for those systems . for example , with the exception of certain particular results , the existence and uniqueness theorem for solutions of initial and boundary value problems is not available in general .",
    "such exceptions include the necessary and sufficient conditions for the temporal existence of smooth solutions of hyperbolic systems admitting conservation laws @xcite .",
    "solutions of hyperbolic quasilinear systems do not exist for an arbitrary period of time , even for smooth conditions .",
    "they usually blow up at the end of a finite time interval . in general , the first derivatives of the solution become unbounded after a finite time @xmath1 , and for a time @xmath2 , smooth solutions no longer exist .",
    "this well - known phenomenon is called the gradient catastrophe @xcite .",
    "it can even occur in situations where physical intuition would lead us to expect the existence of continuous solutions after time @xmath3 .",
    "in other words , the difficulty which appears here is to determine initial data for the quasilinear hyperbolic system which allows sufficiently large time interval before the gradient catastrophe occurs .",
    "it has been proved ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) that even for sufficiently small initial conditions , there exists a time interval @xmath4}$ ] in which the gradient catastrophe does not occur . in this interval",
    ", the problem of propagation and superposition of waves can be posed and solved by the method of characteristics . through this method , the existence , uniqueness and continuous dependence of the solution with respect to the initial conditions has been established by many authors ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the obtained results are significant in the sense that the solution is constructed in the domain where its existence is predicted .",

    "they are building blocks for the construction of more general solutions describing the superposition of many waves , @xmath0-waves ( solutions of rank @xmath0 ) , that are more interesting from the physical point of view @xcite .",
    "recently , the applicability of the conditional symmetry method ( csm ) has been extended to the construction of multiwave solutions obtained by the gmc @xcite .",
    "the csm is not limited to hyperbolic systems , but can also be applied to elliptic systems .",
    "the links between the two methods is an interesting problem which was addressed in @xcite .",
    "the adaptation of the gmc in the context of the analysis of the symmetry group of first - order quasilinear elliptic systems requires the introduction of complex integral elements instead of simple real integral elements ( which are used in the construction of solutions of hyperbolic systems @xcite ) .",
    "in particular , for first - order elliptic systems , we are interested in the construction of multimode solutions corresponding to nonlinear superpositions of elementary solutions ( simple modes ) .",
    "we demonstrate that the method of conditional symmetries @xcite is an efficient tool for reaching this goal . this approach is applied to hydrodynamic - type equations in their elliptic and hyperbolic regions and has been studied through both the gmc and the csm .",

    "this decomposition of the matrix of derivatives is no longer in the specific form restricted to the sum of homogeneous and inhomogeneous integral elements as required by the gmc . in the latter case ,",
