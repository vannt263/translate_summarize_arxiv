    "there is a strong incentive to develop `` mesoscopic '' numerical techniques to model the dynamics of fluids with different characteristic length scales .",
    "mesoscopic simulations make it possible to analyze processes that take place on length and time scales that are out of reach for purely atomistic simulations such as molecular dynamics ( md ) . in md ,",
    "one retains the full atomic details in the description of the system , but at the expense of restricting the studies to short times .",
    "in contrast , models that describe the system at mesoscopic scales , employ a certain degree of coarse graining , which allows one to analyze longer times .",
    "however , care should be taken that the loss of `` atomic '' information associated with the coarse - graining process does not lead to unrealistic features on larger length and time scales .",
    "in particular , the coarse - grained models should provide an adequate description of the equilibrium properties of the system .",
    "some of the mesoscopic models that have been proposed previously in the literature were derived in a systematic way from underlying microscopic models , as is the case with the lattice - boltzmann method@xcite , which can be viewed as a preaveraged lattice gas model@xcite .",
    "coming from the opposite side , smoothed particle dynamics was introduced as a lagrangian discretization of the macroscopic equations of fluid motion@xcite .",
    "a different strategy to simulate structured fluids is to assume that the solvent is passive , and that the suspended objects have a diffusive dynamics with diffusion coefficients that are known _ a priori_. this has led to the development of brownian@xcite and stokesian dynamics@xcite .    in the early nineties , dissipative particle dynamics ( dpd )",
    "was introduced as a novel way to simulate fluids at a mesoscopic scale@xcite . in dpd ,",
    "the fluid is represented by a large number ( @xmath0 ) of point particles that have a pairwise additive interaction .",
    "the interparticle forces are the sum of three contributions .",
    "in addition to the usual conservative forces that can be derived from a hamiltonian , dpd includes dissipative and random forces . these mimic the effect of viscous damping between fluid elements and the thermal noise of the fluid elements , respectively .",
    "flekky and coveney @xcite have shown that , in principle , a particular dpd - like model can be derived from an atomistic description .",
    "however , no such derivations exist for the commonly used dpd models .",
    "nonetheless , even without such a link to the underlying microscopics , it has been shown that thermal equilibrium can be ensured by an appropriate choice of the ratio between dissipative and random forces@xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamic behavior of the dpd model has been explored in some detail@xcite , although the link between the mesoscopic and the macroscopic description is not completely understood .    in conventional dpd ,",
    "all interparticle forces have the same finite interaction range @xmath1 . their amplitudes decay according to a weight function @xmath2 that has been made to vanish at @xmath1 in order to avoid spurious jumps at the cut - off distance . in this paper",
    "we employ a more general description of the conservative interactions . in the existing literature",
    ", the conservative forces have usually been assumed to depend explicitly on the distance between a pair of particles .",
    "for the sake of computational convenience , the conservative forces between dpd particles are taken smooth and monotonic functions of the distance - in fact , the smoothness of the forces is one of the advantages of dpd . when the forces depend linearly on the interparticle separation , the equation of state ( eos ) of the dpd fluid is approximately quadratic in the density and exhibits no fluid - fluid phase transition . even though the forces between dpd particles are smooth , they still induce structure in the fluid ( reminiscent of atomic behavior ) on a length scale of order @xmath1 . in this respect ,",
    "the conventional dpd scheme is similar to other mesoscopic models for non - ideal fluids but differs from the - computationally more demanding - scheme of flekky and coveney that was mentioned above@xcite .",
    "our aim in this paper is to arrive at a formulation of dpd that allows for a description of the behavior of non - ideal fluids and fluid - mixtures . to this end , we look for a model in which there is a direct link between the macroscopic equation of state and the effective interparticle forces .",
    "as we will show , as an additional advantage , our approach results in rather weak structural correlations in the fluid . in the next section we describe in detail the model and how conservative forces are derived .",
    "we will subsequently elaborate the general method on three characteristic examples : a non - ideal fluid without a gas - liquid phase transition that has been studied previously with a different choice of conservative forces , a van der waals fluid , and a mixture with a miscibility gap . in section [",
    "sect : inter ] we look at the interfacial properties of these examples to gain some insight in the physical meaning of the conservative forces that we introduce , and subsequently analyze their equilibrium behavior and compare with previous models .",
    "we conclude with a discussion of our main results .",
    "in dpd one has @xmath0 point particles of mass @xmath3 that interact through a sum of pairwise - additive conservative , dissipative and random forces .",
    "these particles can be interpreted as fluid elements , and the dissipative forces are introduced to mimic the viscous drag between them .",
    "the random force equilibrates the energy lost through friction between the particles , enabling the system to reach an equilibrium state . to be specific ,",
    "if we call @xmath4 the set of particle positions and momenta of the @xmath0 point particles , their dynamics are controlled by newton equations of motion    @xmath5    where we have used the notation @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "@xmath8 denotes a unit vector in the direction of @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the velocity of particle @xmath11 .",
    "the dissipative force , @xmath12 , depends both on the relative positions and velocities of the interacting pair of particles and its amplitude is characterized by the parameter @xmath13 .",
    "this parameter is related to the viscosity of the dpd fluid .",
    "the third term in eq.([eqts - dpd ] ) , @xmath14 , is a random force acting on each pair of dpd particles - @xmath15 stands for a random variable with gaussian distribution and unit variance .",
    "the random force has an amplitude @xmath16 and is also central .",
    "central pair interactions ensure angular momentum conservation ( although the dynamics can be generalized to account for non - central forces @xcite ) .",
    "the dissipative and random forces are completely specified once the weight functions , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are specified- these are smooth and of finite range .",
    "although they can be chosen at will , espaol and warren showed@xcite that @xmath19 and @xmath20 must be related to ensure that the probability to observe a particular configuration of dpd particles is given by the boltzmann distribution in equilibrium .",
    "specifically , if they are chosen such that @xmath21 , then the correct equilibrium distribution is recovered , and the equilibrium temperature of the dpd fluid is fixed by the ratio of the amplitudes of the dissipative and random forces , @xmath22 .",
    "we stress that the dpd equations of motion , eq.([eqts - dpd1]-[eqts - dpd ] ) , can not be derived from a hamiltonian .",
    "traditionally , and for simplicity , the conservative forces in dpd have been taken as pairwise - additive and central , with a weight function related to @xmath23 , and with a variable amplitude that sets the temperature scale in the system .",
    "as long as the force is sufficiently weak that it does not induce appreciable inhomogeneities in the density around a dpd particle , it can only lead to an equation of state with a quadratic dependence in the density , irrespective of the precise choice for the weight function ( see below ) .",
    "one consequence is that phase separation between disordered phases can not occur in a pure system ; at least a binary mixture of different kinds of particles is needed@xcite .",
    "we will first consider the general form that the free energy of a dpd system can have , in order to elucidate the generic shape of consistent conservative forces . in agreement with the idea that the dpd particles refer to lumps of fluid",
    ", it seems natural to assume that the relevant energy associated to their configurations is a free energy , rather than a strictly `` mechanical '' potential energy .",
    "we can express quite generically the free energy @xmath24 of an inhomogeneous system with density @xmath25 as    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is the expression for the local free energy per particle ( in units of @xmath28 ) , and @xmath29 is related to the density of the system at @xmath30 .",
    "this formulation is reminiscent of the strategy followed in density functional theory to study the equilibrium properties of the fluids @xcite .",
    "in fact , the particular case @xmath31 corresponds to the local density approximation in density functional theory , and if @xmath32 is chosen to be an average of the density over an interval around @xmath30 , it can be understood as a weighted density approximation for the true free energy .",
    "we can separate the total free energy , @xmath33 , as the sum of the ideal @xmath34 plus the excess contribution , where @xmath35 is the thermal de - broglie wavelength .",
    "our purpose is to obtain the equivalent expression for a dpd system , in which we have @xmath0 particles distributed in the space .",
    "since the free energy is an extensive quantity , the total free energy of a dpd system can be obviously expressed in terms of the free energy per dpd particle , @xmath36 , as    @xmath37    where we have introduced the symbol @xmath38 to refer to the generalized density defined above , although now expressed in terms of the positions of the discrete @xmath0 dpd particles ( see below ) . comparing eqs.([free_part ] ) and ( [ freevol ] ) , we can easily identify @xmath39 which obviously implies that we can decompose @xmath36 into its ideal and excess contributions .    if the free energy determines the relevant energy for a given configuration of dpd particles , we can then derive the force acting on each particle as the variation of such an energy when the corresponding particle is displaced .",
    "however , the motion of the particles themselves , due to the action of the dissipative and random forces , already accounts for the ideal contribution to the free energy of the system , which is not related to the interactions among the particles .",
    "therefore , only the excess part of the free energy will be involved in the effective interactions between the dpd particles .",
    "accordingly , we can write the conservative force acting on particle @xmath11 , @xmath40 , as    @xmath41    we have derived the generic form for the conservative force acting on a dpd particle as a function of the excess free energy that characterizes the system , which is in general not pair - wise additive .",
    "these forces are analogous to the ones derived from semi - empirical potentials@xcite in md , used to model effectively the many - body interactions in condensed systems .",
    "however , we have started from the macroscopic properties of the system , i.e. its free energy , rather than ensuring microscopic consistency .",
    "we can then fix the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the system beforehand , and derive a set of conservative forces consistent with the desired equilibrium macroscopic behavior .",
    "this procedure is reminiscent of an approach used in other mesoscopic simulation techniques that deal with generic non - ideal fluids@xcite .    given that the free energy has been defined as a functional of a certain local density , local variation in such a density are responsible for the effective forces among the dpd particles .",
    "the particular expression for the forces will then depend both on the specific form of the free energy and on the choice of the local density @xmath38 .",
    "it seems natural to define the local density of a particle @xmath11 as its average on the corresponding interaction range . for simplicity",
    ", we weight this average with the same functions used to define the dissipative and random forces , as introduced in eq.([eqts - dpd ] ) .",
    "therefore , we write @xmath42}\\sum_{j}w(r_{ij } )   \\label{dens}\\ ] ] where @xmath43 $ ] refers to the spatial integral of a given quantity @xmath44 .",
    "the normalization factor @xmath45 $ ] ensures that @xmath46 is indeed a density , so that in a homogeneous region , @xmath47 .",
    "this is in spirit similar to the weighted density approximation in density functional theory@xcite .",
    "the use of a continuous and smooth weight function that vanishes at the cut - off distance , @xmath48 , ensures a smooth sampling of the environment of each particle , avoiding spurious jumps .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason to choose @xmath49 equal to any of the other weight functions , although the particular case of a constant weight function constitutes a pathological limit - in this case the conservative force will only act when one particle enters or leaves the interaction range .",
    "the dependence of the energy of a particular configuration on the particles positions enters implicitly through the weighted densities . for densities of the form given by eq.([dens ] ) , the conservative force acting on particle @xmath11 can be rewritten as    @xmath50}{\\bf e}_{ij}\\equiv \\sum_{j}{\\bf f}_{ij }   \\label{pairwise}\\ ] ]    where we have introduced the notation , @xmath51 , and where the primes denote derivatives with respect to the corresponding variables .",
    "although the free energy of each particle depends on the local density , and leads in general to many - body effective forces , for the particular local density introduced in eq.([dens ] ) , the forces between dpd particles can still be written down as additive pairwise forces- a computational advantage .",
    "the fact that the forces depend on the positions of many particles through their corresponding local weighted densities suggests that in general the local structure of the fluid phase will be smoother than in the case in which forces are derived from a pair - potential .",
    "this is an attractive feature of the present model ; the local structure in a fluid should only be related to its microscopic structure , and should be smeared out at mesoscopic , coarse - grained , scales . in this respect ,",
    "the density - dependent interactions of these dpd models enforce an appropriate length scale separation . in the next sections we will analyze these properties in detail .    before considering specific examples , as a consistency check",
    ", we will analyze the predictions for the pressure of a fluid following the free energy , @xmath52 , and the virial , @xmath53 , routes .",
    "if we start from the free energy per particle , eq.([free_part ] ) , the pressure for a fluid will be    @xmath54    on the other hand , since we have derived the force between particles from the free energy , we can also obtain the pressure of the fluid following the virial route . in this case the pressure is given    @xmath55    where we have approximated the discrete sum over the @xmath0 dpd particles by an integral . introducing the pair correlation function , @xmath56",
    ", we can rewrite the previous equation as @xmath57}\\right\\ } = k_{b}t\\rho -\\frac{\\rho ^{2}}{d}\\frac{\\partial \\psi ^{ex}}{% \\partial \\rho } \\frac{[rw^{\\prime } ] } { [ w ] }   \\label{p : virial}\\ ] ] in the last equality we have assumed that the density is nearly homogeneous , and that therefore @xmath58 is effectively a constant .",
    "otherwise , it is not possible to express the force in terms of the relative coordinates only . if there is no local structure in the fluid , and @xmath59 , then @xmath60=-d[w]$ ] , and then eq.([p : virial ] ) coincides with the prediction for the `` thermodynamic '' pressure , eq.([p : thermo ] ) for any weight function@xcite .",
    "otherwise , a discrepancy between the two pressures will appear because the averaged density @xmath38 is always centered on the corresponding dpd particle- a conditional density- and it is therefore related to the @xmath56 .",
    "we will see in some examples in subsequent sections how such local structure may develop .",
    "theoretical studies have shown that in the fluid phase of dpd , in the hydrodynamic limit the usual navier - stokes equation is recovered@xcite , and that the equilibrium pressure term is related to the pairwise forces through the usual virial expression , as we have derived previously .",
    "this corresponds to dynamics which conserves momentum locally ( as in model - h@xcite ) , instead of being purely relaxational ( as happens in certain dynamical models that start from density functional theories@xcite ) .",
    "by analogy with the usual non - ideal dpd models , in equilibrium we recover a probability distribution for a given configuration in agreement with boltzmann fluctuation theorem : the probability of observing a fluctuation is proportional to the exponential of the deviation of the appropriate thermodynamic potential- the free energy ( as introduced in eq.[freevol ] ) for dpd models at constant volume , temperature and number of particles .    in the following subsections",
    "we will consider three particular examples , where we will compute explicitly the form of the conservative forces .",
    "let us first derive the expression for the conservative force that corresponds to the non - ideal fluid studied by groot and warren @xcite .",
    "they introduce a conservative force of the form    @xmath61    for this conservative force , they have shown that the eos is @xmath62 , where by a numerical fit they found @xmath63 . using the expressions of the previous section ,",
    "the corresponding pairwise force is @xmath64}{\\bf e}_{ij } & , r_{ij}<r_c \\\\   0 & , r_{ij}>r_c \\end{array } \\right .",
    "\\label{eosgw}\\ ] ] it corresponds to an excess free energy per particle @xmath65 , which is linear in the density . as stated in the introduction , an interaction with a smooth , monotonic dependence in position",
    "does not induce a fluid - fluid phase separation .      the van der waals fluid is the classic example of a fluid with a liquid - gas phase transition .",
    "it is characterized by the equation of state @xmath66 ( and excess free energy per particle , @xmath67 ) .",
    "we can recover this eos in a dpd system with pairwise conservative forces of the form ,    @xmath68 } { \\bf e}_{ij } \\label{eosvdw}\\ ] ]    for reasons that will be discussed below , it is helpful to generalize slightly the van der waals fluid allowing for a contribution cubic in the density .",
    "the eos then becomes @xmath69 .",
    "the critical point of this model corresponds to the parameters    @xmath70    @xmath71    the compressibility of the fluid , @xmath72 , in turn , can be written down as @xmath73 in fig.[fig : xi ] we show the behavior of the compressibility for two different values of the parameter @xmath74 , for temperatures close to the critical temperature @xmath75 .",
    "the increase in @xmath76 reduces @xmath72 both above and below the critical temperature .",
    "as expected , @xmath72 becomes negative in a region below @xmath75 that is bounded by a spinodal .    controlling the compressibility of",
    "the fluid is a desirable feature ; a low compressibility helps reducing fluctuations of the fluid interface , which may be useful in simulations .",
    "it also provides a way of modifying properties of the fluid , such as the speed of sound .",
    "moreover , it gives an additional parameter to select the surface tension which , as we will explain , may even change sign in this dpd - van der waals fluid .",
    "finally , it proves useful to reduce the amplitude of the density fluctuations to compare with mean field theoretical predictions , as the ones developed in the next section .      a binary mixture composed of particles of two",

    "the interfacial tension is a function only of the parameter @xmath108 characterizing the long range attraction between the particles , whereas now it depends on all the parameters , @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath76 .",
    "this qualitative difference can already be traced back to the coefficient of the gradient square term in free energy expansion , eq.([free_exp2 ] ) - for the standard van der waals fluid the gradient energy cost is only related to @xmath108 . as a result , in this dpd van der waals fluid there are different contributions to the gradient energy term with different signs .",
    "therefore , depending on their relative strength , it is possible either to favor or penalize the appearance of density gradients in the fluid ; hence , the sign of the interfacial tension may change .    in an atomic fluid ,",
    "the repulsion parameter , @xmath109 , in the van der waals eos arises from the hard core repulsion , while the attraction parameter , @xmath108 , comes from a long range weak attraction .",
    "therefore , they appear in different length scales , and accordingly , only the parameter @xmath108- related to the long - range structure- is responsible for the behavior the interfacial tension . on the contrary , for a dpd fluid",
    "there is no excluded volume interaction , and all interactions between the particles take place at the same length scale , @xmath48 .",
    "then , the relative strength of the different contributions will determine their overall net effect .",
    "it is known that a microscopic model in which both attractions and repulsions are long ranged leads to a van der waals equation of state in which the interfacial behavior can either favor or penalize the presence of interfaces@xcite .",
    "the van der waals fluid introduced in this paper shares these same properties . even if we can ensure a van der waals eos for a fluid , a careful tuning of the parameters @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath76 may lead to a van der waals model for lamellar fluid , whenever interfaces are favored .",
    "although unrealistic for atomic fluids , this behavior is relevant , e.g for nanoparticles , for which repulsive and attractive interactions act on similar length scales@xcite .",
    "therefore , depending on the kind of fluid that needs to be modeled at mesoscopic scales , the parameters in the free energy should be chosen appropriately .",
    "for example , in order to get a positive surface tension , the densities of the fluid phases is restricted because one must ensure that both the pressure and the surface tension are positive . in fig.[fig",
    ": stability ] we display the curves where the pressure and the surface tension vanish for two different values of @xmath76 .",
    "the area defined in between the corresponding set of curves defines the region of phase space where the fluid is mechanically stable with a positive surface tension .",
    "remember that the values of @xmath108 and @xmath109 set the critical values @xmath110 and @xmath95 . the allowed regions do not change very much as the parameter @xmath76 is modified .",

    "as we have mentioned in subsection [ subsec : gw ] , there is no fluid - fluid phase separation in this model ; therefore this negative value of the surface tension does not lead to a proliferation of interfaces .",
    "however , the negative value of @xmath112 implies that the structure factor will have a minimum at a finite wave vector .",
    "we can define a characteristic length , @xmath113 , on which local structure in the fluid will develop . if we expand the free energy eq.([free_dft ] ) to next order in gradients we can estimate this length to be @xmath114}{12 [ w r^2]}}\\ ] ] which does not depend on the amplitude @xmath108 ; only on the shape of the weight function @xmath115 . except for rapidly decaying weight functions ,",
    "this length is of order of the interaction range @xmath48 .",
    "this fact is consistent with the local structure observed in the radial distribution functions for this model ( see section [ sec : gw ] ) .",
    "we have also verified numerically the presence of a minimum in the structure factor @xmath116 .",

    "..    we have performed simulations for a dpd fluid in 3 dimensions , taking as parameters @xmath141 and @xmath142- which corresponds to those used in @xcite . in fig.[fig : gw ] we compare the predictions for the eos given by our model and by running a dpd simulation with the groot - warren model .",
    "groot and warren used the same weight function for all pairwise forces .",
    "the proposed model for this non - ideal fluid shows neatly that for the present class of models a linear weight function is not suitable to sample the local density of each dpd particle , because it leads to a pairwise conservative force that exhibits a discontinuity at the edge of the interaction region , @xmath143 .",
    "we have analyzed the effect of such a jump on the thermodynamic and structural properties of this system . to this end , we have considered both decreasing linear and quadratic @xmath115 s .    in fig.[fig",
    ": gw ] we compare the eos obtained from simulations ; for a quadratic @xmath115 , our model coincides with that of groot - warren .",
    "however , for a linear @xmath115 , the agreement survives only at low densities .",
    "this dpd model has a transition to a solid state at high densities , and the results obtained indicate that the location of such a transition is sensitive to the shape of the weight function - the characteristic force felt by each particle depends on the shape of @xmath115 for a given density . in figs.[fig :",
    "gr_gw_n3]-[fig : gr_gw_n8 ] we compare the radial distribution functions for our model and that of groot - warren , and for for different @xmath115 s , at increasing values of the density .",
    "it is clear that the shape of @xmath115 plays an important role in the local structure of the fluid , and will influence the location of the fluid - solid transition . in section [",
    "sect : fvdw ] we have noted that for the present model there exists a characteristic length , @xmath113 , associated with density fluctuations and which is of order @xmath48 . only for fairly narrow weight functions",
    "will this length become much smaller than @xmath144 .",
    "at low densities , a linear @xmath115 generates less local structure , a pleasant feature for a mesoscopic model .",
    "however , as the density is increased , the local structure develops faster for a linear weight function , leading sooner to a transition to the ordered phase .",
    "the use of a quadratic weight function leads to results identical to those of the gw model , while a linear force tends to smooth the structure at short distances .",
    "the mean repulsion between particles is larger with a linear @xmath115 rather than with a quadratic one .",
    "moreover , it seems plausible to assume that the discontinuity in the force induces a higher sensitivity to local density fluctuations .",
    "these results show how the modifications of the shape of the weight function can be used to tune fine details of the behavior of a fluid , once the eos has been fixed .",
    "next , we focus on the liquid - gas equilibrium properties of a two - dimensional van der waals fluid .",
    "taking a homogeneous system , we can analyze the effect of the density fluctuations on the eos , and compare it with the predictions coming from the macroscopically assumed eos . in fig.[fig : a3 ] , we show the pressure values obtained in simulations run at fixed homogeneous density , volume and temperature . in this case",
    "we can recover the characteristic van der waals loop .",
    "the actual coexistence curve should be derived from it using the equal area maxwell s construction .",
    "the agreement with the expected eos from the macroscopic free energy is very good , and only small deviations are observed , due to particle correlations .",
    "we have also analyzed the density and pressure profiles when we bring into contact a liquid and a gas in the coexistence region .",
    "as mentioned in section [ sect : model ] , the compressibility of the fluid , especially in the coexistence region , is very sensitive to the parameter @xmath76 that characterizes the amplitude of the term cubic in the pressure .",
    "for @xmath145 the density profiles tend to fluctuate substantially .",
    "note that our estimates for the parameters and ranges of stability are all based on a mean field description , which may be no longer quantitatively correct under such conditions . due to this",
    ", a series of simulations will be needed for each set of selected parameters whenever a detailed , quantitative comparison , may be required .",
    "when the parameter @xmath76 is increased ( we have taken the value @xmath146 ) , imposing an initial slab of liquid in coexistence with a slab of gas the interface remains stable , and the density fluctuations in the liquid phase are not too large .    in fig.[fig : templg ] we show the temperature , pressure and mean square displacement of the system during the extension of the simulation .",
    "one can see that the temperature does not shift , and corresponds to its nominally assigned value .",
    "the pressure exhibits important fluctuations , but if we subtract the normal and tangential components ( in the figure we only display the averaged pressure ) , their difference , which is twice the surface tension , gives a value with a well - defined positive mean .",
    "also the mean square displacement shows that particles have had the time to diffuse the interfacial width , which is roughly proportional to the interaction range , @xmath147 , indicating that the droplet is stabilized .",
    "fig.[fig : denslg]a shows the density profiles obtained by starting with a step density profile in the liquid - gas coexistence region , where the numerical errors are smaller than the fluctuations , as in the rest of the plots .",
    "the shape of the drop is stable and the interfaces fluctuate around their initial location , as could be expected . the density ratio between the two fluid phases ,",
    "@xmath148 makes it reasonable to call the two phases liquid and gas .",
    "the density in the gas phase is @xmath149 , which ensures that in both phases the number of interacting particles is sufficiently high . by looking at the density profiles one can also observe that the density fluctuations in the dense phase are small , as expected on the basis of the small compressibility of the fluid .    finally , we have also computed the components of the pressure tensor across the profiles . for an inhomogeneous fluid",
    "there is no unambiguous way of computing the local components of the pressure tensor ; we follow here the procedure described in ref.@xcite and display them in fig.[fig : denslg]b .",
    "they follow basically the increase in density , exhibiting larger fluctuations in the liquid phase . in the bulk phases ,",
    "the two components of the pressure tensor have to be equal .",
    "this is clearly shown in fig.[fig : diffpress ] , where the differences in the two components are confined to the interfaces , if we compare the location of the differences with the density profiles of fig.[fig : denslg]a .",
    "moreover , the increase in fluctuations in the dense phase is clearly displayed .",
    "the equilibration of the drop can also be monitored by analyzing the time scale at which the pressure profile becomes symmetric at both interfaces . together with the pressure differences ,",
    "we have also plotted in thin line the integral of the pressure difference across the profile .",
    "this quantity is the surface tension , and indeed , the values we get when the profile is equilibrated agree with the predictions extracted from the mean pressures , displayed in fig.[fig : templg ] .",
    "we have also computed the excess free energy profile .",
    "its integral gives us an alternative ( thermodynamic ) route to compute the surface tension .",
    "we have verified that the values of the surface tension obtained integrating the excess free energy profile coincides with the value presented above , computed along the virial route .",
    "another appealing feature of these conservative interactions is that their density dependence induces smooth local structure . indeed ,",
    "if we analyze the radial distribution functions for a homogeneous phase , we can see that the structure in this case is almost non - existent .",
    "when an interface is present it is hard to assess the spurious structure that the model may induce through the density profile .",
    "all we can say is that the decay of the density is monotonic from one phase to the other , and avoids therefore spurious structure close to the interface .",
    "such a structure would be spurious on the mesoscopic scale modeled by the dpd fluid .",
    "in contrast , the onset of structuring of the liquid - vapor interface on an atomic scale ( beyond the fisher - widom line ) is a real effect@xcite .",
    "finally , we have run simulations for a binary mixture corresponding to the model described in section [ sect : model].c . as in the previous subsection ,",
    "we concentrate on the equilibrium properties of the fluid in the coexistence region .",
    "we have simulated a 2d fluid , starting with an initial step profile in concentration . in fig.[fig : tempmix ] we show the evolution of the temperature and pressure , which remain essentially constant through the simulation .",
    "we also display the root mean square displacement of the two species .",
    "one can clearly see that after a short initial period , when the species start to feel the presence of the interfaces their effective diffusion slows down .",
    "the fact that the mean square displacement is much larger than the interfacial width , which remains of the order of the interaction range , @xmath48 , ensures that the initial configuration has relaxed to its proper equilibrium shape .",
    "we have computed the concentration profiles as a function of time . in fig.[fig : densmix ] we show the concentration profiles of one of the species at an initial and late stage of the relaxation towards the equilibrium coexistence . as was the case in the van der waals fluid , the fluctuations are greater in the concentrated phase .",
    "although the concentration of each species goes basically to zero in one of the two coexisting phases , the interface does not broaden and keeps its width within @xmath1 . despite this large concentration gradient ,",
    "the mean density barely changes across the interface .",
    "these normalized mean densities are displayed in also in fig.[fig : densmix ] as thin curves .",
    "although a small dip in the normalized mean density appears at the interfaces , its value is not large compared with the typical bulk density fluctuations ( which are due to the compressibility of the fluid ) .",
    "again , this indicates that the use of concentration dependent conservative forces suppresses the appearance of spurious structure at interfaces , while still being able to drive the phase separation .",
    "we can also test the predictions of section [ sec : interbin ] for the interfacial properties on the basis of a binary mixture . to this end , we have integrated numerically eq.([eq : gammaexp ] ) using the concentration profiles obtained from the simulations , and we have compared the results with the theoretical prediction , eq.([eq : sigmabin ] ) .",
    "we display the results in fig.[fig : tension ] , where we have multiplied the theoretical curve by an overall numerical factor , since the numerical prefactors in eq.([eq : sigmabin ] ) are approximate .",
    "one can observe that the overall good agreement is lost at small temperatures , where the interface is very sharp , and close to the critical point , where fluctuations are expected to play a relevant role .",
    "we have presented a new way of implementing conservative forces between dpd particles . rather than assuming a force that depends on the interparticle separation , we have introduced a conservative interaction that depends on the local excess free energy .",
    "in this way , it is possible to fix beforehand , at the mean field level , the desired thermodynamic properties of the system .",
    "however , this procedure neglects the effect of particle correlations .",
    "whenever an accurate quantitative comparison is needed , a set of numerical simulations will be required to determine accurately the appropriate phase diagram .",
    "we could equally use the free energy to carry out monte carlo simulations to analyze the static properties of fluids ; this procedure will suffer from similar drawbacks as a result of the ignored particle correlations .    when the free energy per particle depends on the averaged local density , it is possible to recover central pairwise additive forces- an important computational feature .",
    "the only assumption we have made is that the system is isothermal , although it should be straightforward to generalize it to include energy transport , along the lines developed previously@xcite .",
    "these models can be viewed as a dynamical density functional theory ( dft ) for smooth conservative forces with local momentum conservation . however , since the dpd particles do not have a local structure , these models can only describe the dynamics at a mesoscopic level , while the usual dynamical dft can account for the dynamics down to the microscopic scale .",
    "in addition to the freedom in the choice of the free energy , this new type of proposed forces leads to weaker structure at short distances .",
    "hence , we can enforce a proper length and time scale separation , avoiding the appearance of microscopic features of the system at distances of order @xmath48 .    at the mean - field level , and using standard techniques , it is easy to derive expressions for the interfacial properties .",
    "we have shown that the absence of internal structure of the dpd particles ( implying that all forces act on the same length scale ) leads to qualitatively new behavior not present in atomic fluids . from the physical point of view",
    "it shows that , for example , the same thermodynamic system can be tuned to favor macroscopic or microscopic phase separation .",
    "although it may seem unrealistic , the competition of attractive and repulsive effective potentials on the same length scales correspond to certain physical situations , and they are probably more common on the mesoscopic than in the microscopic domain . in this respect , the models we have introduced are quite flexible because , for a given bulk thermodynamic behavior ( e.g. a given eos ) , it is still possible to modify the parameters to control other physical properties .",
    "for example , the mean interaction strength can be changed by modifying the way in which the local density is sampled , or for the van der waals fluid , it is possible to modify the compressibility ( and hence the speed of sound ) . as in any diffuse interface model , the typical interfacial width sets a minimum length scale in the system . for dpd ,",
    "the natural scale is @xmath48 , unless the parameters are chosen carefully .",
    "the work of the fom institute is part of the research program of `` stichting fundamenteel onderzoek der materie '' ( fom ) and is supported by the netherlands organization for scientific research ( nwo ) .",
