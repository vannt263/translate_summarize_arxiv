    "for fourier transform spectroscopy in the far ir @xmath3 a pellicle mylar is commonly used for the beamsplitter .",
    "the mylar thickness is chosen to give an interference enhancement of the beamsplitter efficiency at the frequencies of interest .",
    "nevertheless , the maximum efficiency is about 35@xmath4 and absorption in the mylar further reduces the efficiency over much of the far infrared",
    ". moreover , the interference zeros of the mylar etalon generally necessitates the use of several different thickness mylar beamsplitters to obtain the desired spectral information .",
    "a final disadvantage of the mylar beamsplitter is that the low frequency response , which is where the signal is usually especially weak , has an @xmath5 fall off below the lowest etalon peak .",
    "while some of these disadvantages are overcome by the use of beamsplitters comprised of a thin film of si evaporated on a thin mylar pellicle , there remain the problems of the low frequency response and the mylar losses .    for many applications of far ir spectroscopy only modest spectral resolution is required . under these conditions",
    "a relatively thick si plate provides a nearly ideal beamsplitter for the entire far infrared up to where caf2 or kbr can be used for @xmath6 .",
    "the si beamsplitter has an average efficiency of 37@xmath4 over this entire spectral range .",
    "for a 2 mm thick si beamsplitter a useful spectral resolution of @xmath7 is achievable . in this paper",
    "we describe the performance of the 2 mm si beamsplitter as implemented on a bomen da-3 ftir .",
    "it is found to be equal or superior in throughput to the mylar over the @xmath8 range and allows spectroscopy over this range without the need to change beamsplitters .",
    "we studied the efficiency of a 2 mm thick silicon beamsplitter over the far infrared frequency range from zero to 1000 @xmath1 which we compare with that of several mylar beamsplitters .",
    "the silicon beamsplitter was fabricated from @xmath9 si and optically polished to with a flatness about 1 micron . using a combination of sources , detectors and filters appropriate for different ranges",
    ", we measured the raw output of the spectrometer under vacuum . while we have not directly measured the throughput , the ratio of their outputs equals the ratio of their throughputs .",
    "the result is a relative throughput comparison .",
    "we find that the silicon shows greater throughput than the mylars over most of this range , and is roughly equal in most of the rest of the spectrum . in this spectral range",
    "the throughput of the silicon has no zeroes at 4 @xmath1 resolution , whereas the mylars all have broad intervals of zero intensity with widths on the order of 10 @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : thruput_0_to_700 ] shows the throughput of the silicon along with that of the 3@xmath10 and 25@xmath10 mylar beamsplitters in the mid infrared . in each case",
    ", we measured the output of the spectrometer with the globar lamp source and a 4k bolometer detector .",
    "the silicon shows greater throughput than the mylars over most of this range , and is significantly weaker only in a tiny window between 600 and 640 due to the optical phonon absorption in si . unlike the @xmath11 mylar",
    ", the silicon beamsplitter has no broad zeroes in this range .     throughput spectrum of si beamsplitter compared with that of the @xmath12 and @xmath11 mylar beamsplitters with globar source , 4 k bolometer , at 4 @xmath1 resolution.,width=325 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig : thruput_0_to_250 ] characterization of the throughput of the silicon and the 6 , 12 , and @xmath13 mylar beamsplitters in the far infrared was made using a mercury lamp source and a 2k bolometer .",
    "we find that the silicon dominates the others from 25 @xmath1 to 250 @xmath1 and is roughly equal to them below that .",
    "again , the silicon has no zeroes at this resolution , while one of the mylars does .",
    "[ fig : thruput_0_to_50]shows the throughput of the silicon and the @xmath14 beamsplitters below 50 @xmath1 . in both cases , we measured the output of the spectrometer configured with the mercury lamp source , the 2k bolometer detector and 2 mm thick fluorogold used to filter out radiation above 50 @xmath1 to minimize baseline errors in the spectrum . in figure 3",
    "we see that the output of the silicon ( and therefore its throughput ) is greater over most of this range , and only slightly less between 12 and 17 @xmath1 .",
    "in particular the si beamsplitter throughput is seen to rise above that of the @xmath14 mylar below 10 @xmath1 .",
    "throughput spectrum of si beamsplitter compared with 6 , 12 and @xmath13 mylar beamsplitter .",
    "hg vapor lamp , 4 k bolometer , at 4 @xmath1 resolution.,width=325 ]     throughput spectrum of si beamsplitter compared with @xmath14 mylar beamsplitter with hg vapor lamp , 4 k bolometer , with 2 mm fluorogold filter at 4 @xmath1 resolution.,width=325 ]",
    "like any parallel plate transparent material , both the silicon and mylar beamsplitters show etalon interference in their transmittance spectra .",
    "both have periodic bands of zero transmission in their spectra . in the mylar beamsplitter",
    "the bands are very broad , and give rise to bands of near zero throughput where the beamsplitter ca nt be used .    in the case of the 2 mm",
    "si beamsplitter the bands are narrow , with a width of about 1 @xmath1 and an etalon spacing of about 0.7 @xmath1 .",
    "[ fig : rawhires]shows the throughput of the si beamsplitter for a spectral resolution of 0.1 @xmath1 . for a resolution",
    "@xmath15 the etalon is averaged and the effective throughput has no zeros .",
    "this allows optical measurements over the whole range of the far ir with a single beamsplitter .",
    "however , for resolution below about 2 @xmath1 the zeros in the si etalon have an effect this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : rescomparison ] where the transmission spectra of a 0.1 mm single crystal quartz sample is shown in the range near the low frequency optical phonon in quartz at 132 @xmath1 with a resolution of 0.1 @xmath1 .",
    "the width of the phonon was varied by varying the sample temperature down to 5 k. these spectra were taken with a globar lamp source and a bolometer , scanning with a resolution of 0.1 @xmath1 .",
    "the transmission data was normalized with the spectrum of an open hole .",
    "the silicon etalon has a period of about 0.7 @xmath1 but the etalon minima are only about 0.1 @xmath1 wide .",
    "the si and mylar beamsplitters yielded nearly identical spectra apart from sharp noise spikes near the etalon minima of the si . from this",
    "it is seen that the 2 mm si beamsplitter can be successfully used for spectral features with widths down to @xmath16 .",
    "accurate spectral data for narrower features requires that the position of the feature does not lie within @xmath17 range of one of the low throughput regions of the beamsplitter etalon .",
    "comparison of transmission spectrum of 0.1 mm crystal quartz near the low frequency optical phonon with the si beamsplitter and @xmath18 mylar beamsplitter at various temperatures .",
