    "@xmath5the distribution of projected rotational velocities of our sample shows a two - component structure : a low - velocity peak at around 80 @xmath2 and a high velocity - tail starting at about 200 kms@xmath6 and extending up to @xmath3600 @xmath2 ( see fig .",

    "these stars thus rotate at less than 20% of their break - up velocity . for the bulk of the sample , mass loss in a stellar wind and/or envelope expansion",
    "is not efficient enough to significantly spin down these stars . if massive - star formation results in fast rotating stars at birth , as one may think from angular momentum conservation considerations , most massive stars have to spin down quickly by some other mechanism to reproduce the observed distribution .",

    "we have estimated projected rotational velocities for the presumably single o - type stars in the vfts sample ( 216 stars ) .",
