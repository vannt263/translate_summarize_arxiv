    "youtube is a representative example of online platforms in which items ( videos in this case ) compete for the attention of users  @xcite .",
    "the popularity of videos vary by orders of magnitude , resembling the fat - tailed distributions that have been reported in other online systems  @xcite , in income and wealth  @xcite , in finance  @xcite , and in disciplines such as ecology , earth science , and physics  @xcite .",
    "the origin of such fat - tailed distributions is a century - old problem that lies at the heart of complex - systems science  @xcite . at the core of the different proposed models",
    "lies the idea that the current popularity ( wealth ) determines the future popularity gain ( income ) and enhances the inequality ( rich - get - richer ) . indeed ,",
    "such ( linear ) _ proportional growth _ is the essential ingredient of gibrat s law ( used to describe the growth of firms  @xcite and cities  @xcite ) , the yule - simon model ( to model species genera  @xcite and language  @xcite ) , scientific memes  @xcite and the preferential attachment model of network growth  @xcite .",
    "proportional growth suggests that the big hits are very predictable because they originate from early advantages that are amplified over time .",
    "the application of growth models to describe the popularity of online items bring new opportunities and challenges .",
    "on the one hand , due to the increasing availability of datasets , it becomes possible to compare models with an unprecedent accuracy . on the other hand ,",
    "the expectations we have of the models are higher .",
    "for instance , a central question is to forecast and identify the origins of the big hits  @xcite , the most successful videos which capture most of the attention and produce most of the revenue through advertisement . to address this and other questions ,",
    "the characterization of the heavy - tailed distribution of aggregated activity is not enough .",
    "one has to : ( i ) improve the description of the dynamics of individual items ; and ( ii ) go beyond the average growth and analyze the stochastic fluctuations  @xcite .",
    "the importance of these factors is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig.1 ] , where we show trajectories ( views vs. time ) of videos with the same early success ( the same number of views , 3 days after publication ) .",
    "we see that trajectories quickly spread and that many trajectories with a weak start become popular in time .",
    "this suggests that big hits have a low predictability ( i.e. , they are hard to anticipate ) .     as a function of the time @xmath0 after publication .",
    "after @xmath1 days the distribution of views is already heavy - tailed ( orange histogram ) .",
    "videos having initially the same amount of views ( blue @xmath2 and green @xmath3 ) show very distinct future evolutions . on the back ,",
    "histograms of the selected videos at @xmath4 days . ]    in this paper , we investigate the predictability of big hits using stochastic models of individual items .",
    "predictability is the possibility of anticipating the future based on present information and we confront the predictability expected from models to observations in the data .",
    "we compare traditional growth models to data ( @xmath5 , views over time ) of more than 10 million youtube videos .",
    "we find that previously proposed models are unable to correctly account for the ( random ) fluctuations observed in the data , which we find to be described by a lvy - stable distribution .",
    "we propose and validate a stochastic model that explains such reduced predictability by incorporating both proportional growth and lvy noise .",
    "this shows that , even if present , proportional growth is not the only responsible for the origin of fat - tailed distributions .",
    "finally we show that our model substantially improves the prediction of the probability of big hits , but that unexpected big hits have an even higher probability in real data due to temporal correlations not accounted by this class of models .",
    "youtube is a website where videos generated by third parties are shared .",
    "it is the third most visited website of all internet .",
    "we collected more than 10 million time series of the daily number of views of videos published between dec 2011 and mar 2013  @xcite .",
    "the number of views a video receives depends on the interplay between its content and various factors .",
    "videos related to ongoing events are strongly influenced by their development , its media coverage , and other factors exogenous to the online activity of users .",
    "videos are also influenced by endogenous factors , such as the sharing and recommendation in online media , generating cascades of actvity in the social network  @xcite .",
    "additionally , a video can be viewed by following a link from a related video , i.e. hopping through the videos network which changes continuously according to youtube s recommendation algorithms .",
    "the interplay and feedback between these and other factors lead to the complex dynamics we observe in the time series .",
    "modeling specific factors  @xcite and differentiating between them ( e.g. , between exogenous and endogenous factors  @xcite ) are topics of recent research .",
    "this approach is difficult to be pursued because it requires detailed information of user activities and the possibility of isolating the factors . instead",
    ", here we aim at a coarse - grained description of the dynamics of attention in which the combination of the different factors described above are _ effectively _ accounted by deterministic and stochastic terms .",
    "let @xmath5 be the cumulative number of views that a video received in the first @xmath0 days after its release .",
    "a very general stochastic model for the growth of @xmath5 in @xmath0 is the diffusion process  @xcite @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a wiener process ( @xmath8 and @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 is the average growth , and @xmath11 scales the fluctuations ; an additional cutoff in @xmath12 is added to ensure that @xmath13 .",

    "our results bring new insights on the attention economy of the internet .",
    "the fact that the multiple factors affecting the popularity of videos can be effectively modeled by a lvy - stable distribution shows that the decision of different individuals are correlated to each other and lead itself to strong fluctuations .",
    "the lvy - stable distribution is invariant under convolution , i.e. if @xmath85,@xmath86 are stable , also @xmath87 is stable , and therefore it is a natural attractor for the combination of multiple ( fat - tailed ) processes , as the ones that creates the bursty activity patterns that characterize online social media as well .",
    "one challenge for future work is to identify mechanistic models of the spreading of information on the internet ( e.g. , models in which viral items spread through a social network ) that are compatible with these fluctuations  @xcite .",

    "the estimation is quite sensitive to the fluctuations where most data is located , and for this reason it can fail when it comes to the determination of the tail exponent if no threshold is set  @xcite ; this causes many histograms that seem to have the same tail to be fitted with very different values of @xmath42 . on another side , once the parameters of the fits for each @xmath136 are extracted , it is not clear how to obtain the best parametrization of them , because of the presence of lvy - distributed errors ; the main limitations here are the truncation of fluctuations at @xmath137 ( not to be confused with the lower positive limit on @xmath5 of scheme 1 described in sec . 1 of the si ) , and the discretization of the @xmath15 variable , which prevents a fit on the rescaled variable @xmath138 .    the choice of maximizing the likelihood that we propose in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of the main text avoids these problems in a natural way , by using maximizing the likelihood of the all the data in the same process .",
    "the maximization of the likelihood is performed by minimizing @xmath139 numerically through the nelder - mead algorithm , implemented in the python package ` scipy ` as ` optimize.fmin ` .",
    "the optimization is repeated @xmath140 times with different , random , initial conditions , in order to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum of the likelihood .",
    "finally , the minimum of all the minima found is chosen .",
    "we compare the models with the bayes information criterion ( bic  @xcite ) , a way of penalizing the increase of likelihood due to the addition of parameters : @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the likelihood ( as computed in eq .",
    "( 3 ) of the main text ) , @xmath24 is the total amount of data and @xmath143 is the total amount of parameters .    in fig .",
    "sm[fig.sm1 ] we plot the difference of the bic of model @xmath144 and other model @xmath126 , @xmath145 . a higher value of the bic difference indicates a higher support for the s3 model .",
    "overall , the s3 model is the best . while the s2 model is already performing better than the ln ,",
    "the difference with s3 is considerably larger .",
    "instead , the difference of bic between s3 and s4 is not so big , and sometimes the value of the parameters of the s4 model coincide with the s3 ( @xmath146 close to 0 ) . so while the addition of the @xmath52 term to the s2 model is of crucial importance , the addition of @xmath146 is not improving the model in the same way .",
    "the parameters of the s3 model ( eq.(2 ) of the main text ) are explicitly time dependent . in fig .",
    "sm[fig.sm2 ] the values of these are shown for the first 30 days after the publication of the videos .",
    "two main features are worth noticing .",
    "first , the parameters seem to relax to a particular value after the first week , including the exponent of the lvy distribution , @xmath147 .",
    "second , the value of @xmath21 becomes negative ; at first sight it can seem that is in contradiction with the positive slope of @xmath148 ( see fig .",
    "2(a ) of the main text ) , however , this is not the case , because the truncation of the stable distribution at @xmath137 makes the average of the distribution * not * to be @xmath149 .",
    "if the average is computed from the fitted distribution , then the real average is recovered ."
