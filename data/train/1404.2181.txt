    "[ gk - fig](b ) ) .",
    "this is faster than diffusion , but slower than ballistic motion .",
    "faster than diffusive motion is to be expected ; if a distant particle is going to be the first invader , it needs to do so quickly or else another particle that is initially closer to the origin will be the first invader .",

    "the earliest hitting time is of the order of the diffusion time , but modified by a logarithmic function of the gas density .",
    "this weak dependence means that it requires an extremely high density of the gas to reduce the first hitting time much below the diffusion time .",

    "both analytically and from simulations , we found that the controlling factor in this probability decays at large @xmath5 as the stretched exponential function @xmath158 , with @xmath159 exactly calculable and whose numerical value is @xmath160 .",
    "correspondingly , the characteristic time @xmath8 for the @xmath4 particle to hit the origin scales as @xmath9 .",
    "this is much less than the diffusion time , which scales as @xmath161 , but much larger than the ballistic time , which scales as @xmath5 .",

    ", we have assumed the deterministic initial condition of a fixed number of particles at each lattice site .",
    "if the particles are initially placed with a poisson distribution of separations , @xmath116 still behaves asymptotically as @xmath162 , but with @xmath163 distinct from the above constant @xmath164 , and with a different @xmath5-dependence in the pre - exponential factor  @xcite .",
    "finally , it is worth mentioning that the first hitting probability for an @xmath149-particle system is , in principle , computable from a corresponding electrostatic formulation .",
    "the diffusion of the @xmath149 particles on the half line is equivalent to the diffusion of a single effective particle in the positive @xmath165-tant in @xmath149-dimensional space  @xcite .",
