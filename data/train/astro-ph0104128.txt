    "the current standard model for gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) and their afterglows is the fireball shock model ( see piran 1999 for a recent review ) .",
    "it involves a large amount of isotropic equivalent energy release , @xmath0 ergs , within a few seconds and in a small volume with negligible baryonic load , which leads to a fireball that expands ultra - relativistically into the external medium .",
    "a substantial fraction of the kinetic energy of the baryons is transferred to a non - thermal population of relativistic electrons through fermi acceleration in the shock ( e.g. mszros @xmath1 rees 1993 ) .",
    "the accelerated electrons cool via synchrotron emission and inverse compton scattering in the post - shock magnetic fields and produce the radiation observed in grbs and their afterglows ( e.g. paczyski & rhoads 1993 ; katz 1994 ; sari et al .",
    "1996 ; vietri 1997 ; waxman 1997a ; wijers et al .",
    "the shock could be either @xmath2 due to collisions between fireball shells caused by outflow variability ( paczyski @xmath1 xu 1994 ; rees @xmath1 mszros 1994 ) , or @xmath3 due to the interaction of the fireball with the surrounding interstellar or wind media ( mszros @xmath1 rees 1993 ; dai & lu 1998 ; chevalier & li 1999 ) .    when the relativistic ejecta encounters the external medium , a relativistic _ forward _ shock expands into the external medium and a _ reverse _ shock moves into and heats the fireball ejecta . the shocked ambient and ejecta materials are in pressure balance and separated by a contact discontinuity . the forward shock continuously heats fresh gas and accelerates electrons , producing long - term afterglows through the synchrotron emission ( e.g. waxman 1997a , b ; wijers et al",
    "1997 ; vietri 1997 ; wang et al .",
    "2000a , b ; dai & lu 1999 , 2000 ; dai et al .",
    "1999 ; huang et al .",
    "1998 , 2000 ; gou et al . 2001 ) . on the other hand , the reverse shock operates",
    "only once and after that emission from the fireball ejecta are suppressed after the reverse shock crosses the ejecta , since then the ejecta expands and cools adiabatically .    when a reverse shock crosses the shell , the shocked shell and the forward shocked external medium carry comparable amount of energy . however , the typical temperature of the shocked shell electrons is lower since the particle number density is higher .",
    "so , the typical frequency of the synchrotron radiation from the shocked shell is considerably lower .",
    "a strong prompt optical flash ( akerlof et al . 1999 ) and late time radio flare behavior ( kulkarni et al . 1999 ) , accompanying grb990123 , have been attributed to the synchrotron emission process from this reverse shock ( sari & piran 1999 ; mszros & rees 1999 ) .    in a recent paper ( wang , dai & lu 2001 ; hereafter wdl )",
    ", we analytically study the high energy @xmath4-ray emission from the ssc process in the reverse shocks .",
    "the result showed that this emission dominates over the components of the the synchrotron and ic emissions from forward shocks at high energy @xmath4-ray bands from tens of mev to tens of gev .",
    "furthermore , we suggest that this mechanism may explain the observations of the prompt high energy gamma - rays detected by egret , such as those from grb930131 .    in this work ,",
    "we numerically calculate the ssc radiation components in the forward and reverse shocks .",
    "we also consider another two combined - ic processes , i.e. scatterings of reverse shock photons on the forward shocked electrons and forward shock photons on the reversely shocked electrons . for a wide range of shock parameters ,",
    "the present numerical results confirm our previous suggestions that the ssc emission from reverse shocks is the most important at the energy bands to which egret is sensitive .    while ic emissions from afterglow forward shocks ( e.g. sari et al .",
    "1996 ; totani 1998a ; waxman 1997 ; panaitescu & mszros 1998 ; wei & lu 1998 , 2000 ; chiang & dermer 1999 ; dermer , b@xmath5ttcher & chiang 2000 ; dermer , chiang & mitman 2000 ; panaitescu & kumar 2000 ) and grb internal shocks ( papathanassiou & mszros 1996 ; pilla & loeb 1998 ; panaitescu & mszros 2000 ) have attracted a lot of investigation , the studies for ic process in reverse shocks and combined - ic scatterings between reverse and forward shocks ( i.e. very early afterglows ) are still quite preliminary ( see e.g. mszros , rees & papathanassiou 1994 ) .    in section 2 ,",
    "we briefly describe the hydrodynamics evolution of a fireball shell .",
    "we present in section 3 the synchrotron seed spectra and shocked electron distributions , then perform a numerical calculation of ic emissions in section 4 .",
    "finally , we give a summary and discussion .",
    "let s consider an ultrarelativistic cold shell with energy @xmath6 , initial lorentz factor @xmath7 and a width @xmath8 in the observer frame expanding into a cold external interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "when the shell sweeps up a large volume of ism matter , it begins to be decelerated significantly .",
    "the interaction between the shell and the ism matter leads to two shocks : a forward shock propagating into the ism and a reverse shock moving back into the shell .",
    "there are four regions separated by the two shocks and a contact discontinuity : the cold ism ( denoted by the subscript 1 ) , the shocked ism ( 2 ) , the shocked shell material ( 3 ) and the unshocked shell material ( 4 ) . from the shock jump conditions and the equalities of pressure and velocity along the contact discontinuity , we can evaluate the lorentz factor @xmath4 , the pressure @xmath9 and the number density @xmath10 in the shocked regions in terms of three variables @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath7 ( blandford & mckee 1976 ; sari & piran 1995 ) .",
    "sari & piran ( 1995 ) showed that , if the shell is thin : @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is the sedov length , the reverse shock is newtonian ( with shell spreading , the reverse shock can be mildly relativistic ) , which means that the lorentz factor of the shocked shell material @xmath15 is almost unity in the frame of the unshocked shell and @xmath16 . on the other hand , if the shell is thick : @xmath17 , the reverse shock is relativistic with @xmath18 and it then considerably decelerates the shell material ( kobayashi 2000 ) .",
    "after the shell being decelerated , the evolution of the adiabatic forward shock follows the blandford - mckee solution ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) . for the shocked shell",
    ", its dynamic evolution may be complex .",
    "kobayashi & sari ( 2000 ) showed that if the fireball shell has relativistic temperature , the blandford - mckee solution can be regarded as an adequate description quite early on .",
    "but for the case that the reverse shock is only mildly - relativistic , the evolution of the shocked shell may deviate the blandford - mckee solution",
    ". this may affect the time evolution of the late - time reverse shock emission , but does not affect our computation of the peak - time emission .",
    "the ic emissions depend on both the seed photon spectrum and the shocked electron distribution .",
    "we assume the synchrotron seed spectrum to be described by four broken power - law segments as given in sari et al .",
    "the distributions of newly - shocked electrons in both the forward and reverse shocks are assumed to be a power law of index @xmath9 ( @xmath19 ) , with the minimum lorentz factor of shocked electrons in the shell rest frame being @xmath20 , where @xmath21 is the fraction of thermal energy carried by electrons ( sari , piran & narayan 1998 ) . here for the forward shock @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the reverse shock . assuming that @xmath24 is the fraction of the thermal energy carried by the magnetic field , the magnetic field strength is @xmath25 , where @xmath26 , and @xmath27 .",
    "the shocked relativistic electrons cool through synchrotron emission and ic scatterings of the synchrotron photons ; thus the lorentz factor of the electrons that cool on a timescale equal to the dynamic timescale is given by @xmath28 where @xmath29 denotes the time in the observer frame , @xmath30 is the compton parameter , @xmath31 is the redshift of the burst source and @xmath32 is the thomson scattering cross section .",
    "the compton parameter @xmath30 , defined to be the ratio between the inverse compton luminosity of electrons and the synchrotron luminosity , can be expressed as @xmath33 , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the energy density of synchrotron radiation and magnetic field , respectively , and @xmath36 represents the fraction of the electron energy that was radiated away ( sari & esin 2001 ; panatescu & kumar 2000 ) . for fast cooling electrons ,",
    "@xmath30 is estimated to @xmath37 and it may be smaller for slow cooling electrons .",
    "however , as the two combined - ic processes ( i.e. scattering of reverse shock photons on the electrons in forward shocks and forward shock photons on the electrons in reverse shocks ) are considered here , the ic cooling of the electrons in both shocks should be dominated by the larger of the two photon fields . because both shocks have comparable energy , the magnetic filed energies in the two shocks are comparable , and therefore @xmath30 in two shocks is almost the same and equals to @xmath37 as long as one shock is in the fast cooling regime .    according to the shell thickness",
    ", we divided our discussion into two cases : the thin shell case and the thick shell case .",
    "the thin shell case implies that the deceleration timescale @xmath38 ( defined as the observer time at which the heated ism energy is comparable to the initial energy @xmath6 ) , i.e. @xmath39 is larger than the shell crossing time ( @xmath40 ) , where @xmath41 and @xmath42 , while the thick shell has @xmath43 . the reverse shock emission peaks at @xmath38 for the thin shell case and at @xmath40 for the thick shell .",
    "our following calculations of the ic spectra correspond to this peak time .",
    "as described by sari et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , the synchrotron radiation from the shocked electrons can be approximated by a broken power - law spectrum with three characteristic break frequencies .",
    "one is the self - absorption frequency , @xmath44 .",
    "the other two are the peak frequencies of the emission from the electrons with the characteristic lorentz factor @xmath45 and the cooling lorentz factor @xmath46 , denoted as @xmath47 and @xmath48 , respectively . as usual",
    ", the fraction of thermal energy carried by electrons , @xmath49 , and magnetic field , @xmath24 , is assumed to be similar in the forward and reverse shock . at the peak time @xmath38 of the reverse shock emission ,",
    "the break frequencies @xmath47 from the two shocks are , respectively , @xmath50 and @xmath51 the equipartition values are chosen to be the ones inferred for grb970508 : @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( granot et al .",
    "1999 ; wijers & galama 1999 ) .",
    "similarly , the cooling break frequencies of both shocks are given by @xmath54 the peak flux of the synchrotron radiation is given by ( wijers & galama 1999 ) @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the peak spectral power and @xmath57 is the luminosity distance of the burst . note that for the forward shock , @xmath58 is the total number of swept - up ism electrons while for the reverse one , @xmath58 is the total number of shocked shell electrons .",
    "then , we obtain the peak flux of the two shocks at the time @xmath38 : @xmath59 @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "now we derive the synchrotron self - absorption frequency of the reverse shock emission . in the comoving frame of the shocked gas ( denoted with a prime ) , the absorption coefficient @xmath62 scales as @xmath63 for @xmath64 and as @xmath65 for @xmath66 . in this frame , the absorption coefficient for @xmath66 is given by ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ) @xmath67 where @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the electron charge and @xmath71 is the gamma function . noting that the shocked shell width in the comoving frame @xmath72 and setting @xmath73 we get the synchrotron self - absorption frequency @xmath74 in the observer frame , @xmath75 for @xmath76 .",
    "similarly , one can obtain the synchrotron self - absorption frequency of the forward shock emission , @xmath77 please note that because the forward shock always locates in front of the reverse shock , there will be almost no detected reverse shock emission below the self - absorption frequency of the forward shock .",
    "thus , the synchrotron spectrum of the slow - cooling reverse shock is described by @xmath78 while for the forward shock , which is in the fast cooling regime for typical shock parameters , @xmath79      in a thick shell case , the reverse shock becomes relativistic before it crosses the entire shell and begins to decelerate the shell material .",
    "it crosses a thick shell at @xmath80 and the peak time of the reverse shock emission is comparable to the grb duration @xmath81 .",
    "the lorentz factor of the shocked shell scales with time as ( sari 1997 ) @xmath82 thus the lorentz factor of the reverse shock at this peak time is @xmath83 the reference values of the comoving width and the initial lorentz factor of the thick shell have been chosen to be @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively . the shock radius at the peak time of the reverse shock emission is @xmath86 using the expressions of @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath30 parameter , and eq.(7 )",
    ", we obtain the break frequencies and peak flux of the reverse shock synchrotron spectrum : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 noting that the shocked shell width in the comoving frame @xmath90 and the number density @xmath91 , we can also obtain the self - absorption break frequency @xmath44 using eq.(10 ) for the thick shell case . since for a thick shell , the reverse shock is generally in the fast cooling regime , the synchrotron spectrum is described in a way similar to eq.(14 ) .",
    "the electron distribution @xmath92 in shocked shell or shocked external medium is determined by the initial shocked electron distribution @xmath93 and by electron cooling effect through synchrotron and ic radiation and possibly by the self - absorption of the synchrotron photons .",
    "if the newly - shocked electrons with typical lorentz factor @xmath45 cools faster than the shock dynamics timescale , the resulting electron distribution takes the form @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the maximum lorentz factor of shocked electron , which is determined by equating the electron acceleration timescale with the synchrotron cooling timescale ( e.g. mszros , laguna & rees 1993 ) , i.e. @xmath96 . in the opposite case ,",
    "most electrons have a random lorentz factor @xmath45 , and the electron distribution is @xmath97",
    "after having obtained the seed photon spectrum and the electron distribution , now we can compute the up - scattering emissions of the synchrotron radiation by relativistic electrons in the very early external shocks .",
    "we consider only the first - order ic and neglect higher order ic processes , because a once - scattered typical photon by a typical electron with @xmath98 has energy of order @xmath99 in the rest frame of the second scattering electron .",
    "then we can no longer use thomson limit to the scattering cross section , and the energy gained of the scattered photon in each successive scattering will be reduced due to electron recoil and to the necessity of using klein - nishina scattering cross section ( sari & esin 2001 ) .    for single scattering , the ic volume emissivity in the comoving frame for a distribution @xmath100 of scattering electrons",
    "is given by ( rybicki & lightman 1979 ; sari & esin 2001 ) @xmath101 where @xmath102 , @xmath103 is the incident specific flux at the shock front in the comoving frame , and @xmath104 reflects the angular dependence of the scattering cross section for @xmath105 ( blumenthal & gould 1970 ) . noting that @xmath106 and the synchrotron flux @xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the comoving width of the shocked shell or ism medium and @xmath109 is source distance",
    ", we obtain the ic flux in the observer frame @xmath110 by transforming eq.(23 ) into the observer frame .",
    "apart from the ssc scattering processes in the reverse and forward shocks , another two combined - ic scattering processes are also present .",
    "because approximately one - half of the photons arised in one shock region will diffuse into the another shock region from the point of view of the comoving frame , the ic flux eq.(24 ) for the combined - ic scatterings should be divided by a factor of two .",
    "though the scattered photons move isotropically in the comoving frame , the beaming effect makes these photons moving along the direction to the observer .",
    "our main calculation results are as follows :    \\i ) the ic spectral flux from a relativistic thin shell expanding into an ism at the deceleration time are shown in fig .",
    "typical shock parameters are used : @xmath111 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath76 and @xmath112 .",
    "four ic spectra are displayed in the figure , including two ssc spectra from the reverse shock ( _ solid curve _ ) and forward shock ( _ dotted curve _ ) , respectively , scatterings of the reverse shock photons on the forward shocked electrons ( _ dash - dotted curve _ ) and the forward shock photons on the reversely shocked electrons ( _ dashed curve _ ) . from fig.1",
    ", it can be clearly seen that the ssc from the reverse shock dominates over the other three ic components at gamma - ray bands less than a few tens of gev with a peak around a few mev . at @xmath113 ,",
    "the ssc component of the reverse shock exceeds other ic components by about two orders of magnitude .",
    "although the peak location of ssc emission strongly depends on this unknown parameter @xmath114 , this emission dominates over other ic emissions for a wide range of shock parameters .",
    "\\ii ) in fig.2 , we present the energy spectra ( @xmath115 ) of the ic emissions with various shock parameters for the thin shell case . we find that a ) for a wide range of shock parameters , the ssc component from reverse shocks is the most important at energy bands from tens of mev to tens of gev , to which egret is sensitive .",
    "it dominates over both other ic and the synchrotron emission components .",
    "b ) the ssc spectra from reverse shocks above the turnover ( @xmath116 ) are logarithmically more flattening than that of the seed synchrotron spectrum and varying continuously . for small values of @xmath9",
    ", we even find that the ic energy output peak well above @xmath117 , which is the peak emission frequency for the approximate power - law ic spectrum .",
    "a similar result was reached by sari & esin ( 2001 ) for the ssc of afterglow emission . moreover , for small value of @xmath9 ( e.g. @xmath118 ) , the ssc emission from the reverse shock dominates over the synchrotron and ic processes even in the tev energy bands ( see fig .",
    "c ) fig.2 also suggest that strong tev emission should also be emitted from the two combined - ic and forward shock ssc processes for most grbs . for a moderate steep distribution of the shocked electrons ( e.g. @xmath76 ) , the combined - ic and/or forward shock ssc become increasing dominated at tev bands .",
    "however , it would only be detected from nearby , low - redshift bursts for which the attenuation due to intergalactic infrared emission is small .",
    "\\iii ) egret has detected prompt emission above @xmath119 from several bright grbs triggered by batse ( catelli et al .",
    "1998 ) , among which gev photons have been detected from grb930131 ( sommer et al . 1994",
    "; ryan et al . 1994 ) and grb940217 ( hurley et al . 1994 ) .",
    "grb940217 even exhibits delayed gev emission 90 minutes after the trigger .",
    "several models have been proposed to explain the delayed and prompt gev emissions .",
    "for example , mszros & rees ( 1994 ) proposed that the impact of a relativistic wind from the central engine on the external matter may cause the delayed gev emission ; katz ( 1994 ) suggested that the impact of the fireball on a dense clouds could produce high - energy gamma - ray emission via @xmath120 decay process ; vietri ( 1997 ) and totani ( 1998a , b ) suggested that the synchrotron radiation of the protons may be responsible for the gev emissions ; etc . in a recent paper ( wdl ) , we have suggested that the ssc emission from the reverse shock could explain both the flux level and the spectrum of the high energy gamma - rays detected by egret .",
    "we here compute the slope of the photon spectrum at high energy bands and plot it in fig .",
    "3 . we can see that at energy bands from tens of mev to tens of gev , the photon spectrum index @xmath121 ( the photon number @xmath122 ) ranges from 1.7 to 2.15 , which is consistent with the observed high energy gamma - ray photon spectrum by egret from some bright grbs ( e.g. sommer et al . 1994 ) .",
    "\\iv ) then , we investigate the ssc emission from the reverse shock of a thick shell .",
    "we compute the time - integrated ssc energy spectrum for a thick shell with typical parameters as @xmath123 , @xmath111 , @xmath76 and @xmath112 , but with different values of the initial lorentz factor @xmath7 : @xmath124(_dash - dotted curve _ ) , @xmath125(_dashed curve _ ) and @xmath126 ( _ dotted curve _ ) .",
    "they are plotted in fig .",
    "4 . in comparison with the thin shell case ( _ solid curve _ ) . as @xmath7 increases , the peak frequency of the time - integrated ssc energy spectrum increase accordingly .",
    "the peak frequency of ssc emission of the thick shell is not far from that of the thin shell case with the same @xmath7 and typical shock parameters , though the reverse shock of the thick shell is relativistic .",
    "this is because that this ic emission peaks at @xmath127 ( this reverse shock is in the fast cooling regime ) , which is close to @xmath128 for the thin shell .",
    "fig.4 also shows that the peak flux is much lower than the thin shell case .",
    "the reason is that at the peak time of the reverse shock emission , the shell has traveled to a larger distance , resulting a lower electron scattering optical depth in the shell .",
    "the fireball model for grbs involving an ultrarelativistic fireball ejecta expanding into an external medium has two successful predictions : one is the afterglow emission from the synchrotron process in the forward shock region ( katz 1994 ; mszros & rees 1997 ) , and another is the prediction of bright optical emission when a reverse shock is present ( sari & piran 1999b ) .",
    "subsequent observations of multiwavelength afterglows ( e.g. wijers , rees & mszros 1997 ) and a bright optical flash ( akerlof et al .",
    "1999 ) gave basic confirmation of this model .",
    "in this paper , we calculate the ssc and combined - ic emissions from these two shock regions at very early phases . for a wide range of shock parameters , the ssc emission from the reverse shock dominates over the synchrotron and other ic emissions at energy bands from tens of mev to tens of gev , while the combined - ic and/or the forward shock ssc emissions become increasingly dominant at tev energy bands .",
    "we further compute the photon spectrum index @xmath121 ( viz .",
    "@xmath129 ) of the reverse shock ssc emission , which is @xmath130 for typical shock parameters at energy bands to which egret is sensitive .",
    "based upon this and the ssc spectral flux level , we suggest that this process can provide a plausible explanation for the prompt high energy gamma - rays detected from some bright bursts , such as those from grb930131 , grb910503 and grb940217 etc . in wdl , we also derived the decaying light curves of ssc emission after the reverse shock peak time and found that it decays quite rapidly , regardless whether the observed band locates above or below the cooling break frequency of the inverse compton component .",
    "the planned gamma - ray large area space telescope ( glast ) mission will have larger effective area and field of view than egret , and so will likely be able to monitor the time evolution of the high energy gamma - ray flux .    at tev",
    "energy bands , the combined - ic emissions and the ssc emission from the forward shock become dominant over the ssc from the reverse shock for intermediate values of @xmath9 ( e.g. @xmath76 ) .",
    "nevertheless , for small values of @xmath9 , the ssc from the reverse shock still dominates even in tev energy bands .",
    "recently the milagro group reported evidence for tev emission from grb970417a , one of the 54 batse grbs in the field of view of their detector , milagrito ( atkins et al . 2000 ) .",
    "an excess of gamma - rays above background is seen during the durations of this burst and the chance probability for detecting such an excess is estimated to be less than @xmath131 .",
    "totani ( 2000 ) suggested that proton - synchrotron model of grbs provides a possible explanation for these observational results .",
    "our calculation is also consistent with detection of tev emission from grbs that are near enough to avoid serious attenuation due to intergalactic infrared radiation field .",
    "two currently popular models for grbs are the mergers of compact objects ( neutron stars or black holes ) and the cataclysmic collapse of massive stars . in the former model ,",
    "compact objects are expected to have significant spacial velocities so that their mergers would take place at many kiloparsecs outside their birthplaces .",
    "thus , grbs produced by this model would occur in the interstellar medium ( ism ) with density @xmath132 .",
    "however , if a collapsing massive star ( woosley 1993 ; paczyski 1998 ) is the origin of the grbs , the circumburst medium is the wind ejected by the star prior to its collapse , whose density decreases outwards . in the wind circumburst",
    "medium case , the external medium density is much higher than the ism case at the deceleration length - scale and the magnetic field is much higher accordingly .",
    "therefore , from eq.(2 ) , we know that most of the shocked electrons cool to be sub or trans - relativistic ones ( @xmath133 ) on the deceleration time @xmath38 ( also see eq.(14 ) in dai & lu 2001 ) . with such low values of @xmath46 , the self - absorbed cyclo - synchrotron radiation and multiple compton scatterings of these cooled electrons",
    "may construct the low - energy part of the resulting spectrum . at the high - frequency part ,",
    "the spectrum is similar to the fast - cooling spectrum of relativistic electrons , i.e. the spectrum is still in the form of @xmath134 extending up to @xmath47 and then @xmath135 upward , produced by the cooling of newly - shocked electrons .",
    "the resulting ic spectra in this case is therefore much more complicated . also , we estimate that the ic spectra flux at gev to tev bands may be as high as that of the ism case .",
