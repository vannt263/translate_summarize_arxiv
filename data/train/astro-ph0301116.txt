    "recent near infrared ( nir ) surveys reveal isophote twists in the central regions of barred galaxies , which are thought to be the signature of a bar within a bar ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "recent models of double - barred galaxies have had some success in reproducing relatively long - lived central features that can explain the isophote twists .",
    "@xcite model galaxies as gravitational stars and dissipative gas clouds and find that the nir isophote twists are caused by viscous and gravitational torques that drag the central regions of the main bar out of alignment with the rest of the bar .",
    "@xcite suggest that the nir isophote twists are the result of a kinematically distinct `` nuclear bar '' that can rotate with up to six times the pattern speed of the large - scale bar .",
    "one thing these models have in common is the need for dissipation .",
    "both groups have to include large amounts of molecular gas in order for the models to be able to reproduce and sustain the observed features .",
    "the models of barred galaxies by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite produce very different nuclear morphologies by varying the amount of gaseous component included in the simulations .",
    "more problematically , the models of @xcite and @xcite exhibit different central morphologies by simply changing the _ properties _ of the interstellar medium .    in an attempt to test these models ,",
    "we have undertaken a study of the molecular gas properties of a sample of galaxies believed to contain double bars based on the nir isophote twists observed in their nuclei ( see tables [ galaxytable ] and [ nucleustable ] ) . in paper",
    "i @xcite we find that , despite similarities in the nir images , the co maps show very different morphologies .",
    "for example , the co maps of ngc 2273 , ngc 2782 , and ngc 4736 exhibit what may be interpreted as nuclear bars that align with the nuclear nir isophote twists @xcite , while ngc 6951 shows twin peaks of molecular gas collecting at an inner lindblad resonance @xcite .",
    "ngc 5728 shows a very disordered co structure where the clumps of co emission do not seem to align with any structures seen at other wavelengths @xcite .",
    "simulations of galaxies ( both single- and double - barred ) have shown that the details of the nuclear structure and inflow rates depend on the assumed gas properties of the models .",
    "for example , @xcite demonstrated that the nuclear bar of a double - barred galaxy can either be phase locked ( as predicted by * ? ? ? * ) or kinematically separated from the primary bar ( as predicted by * ? ? ? * ) depending on the gas viscosity in the models .",
    "more recently , @xcite modeled the flow of gas in a realistic double - barred potential and found that the inflow rates depend on the sound speed of the interstellar medium .",
    "galaxies with high sound speeds had greater inflow rates and the gas was able to reach all the way into the nucleus . in the galaxies with lower sound speeds , the infalling gas is trapped into a circumnuclear ring near the inner lindblad resonance ( ilr ) and even the torques exerted by the nuclear stellar bar are not enough to transport the gas inwards beyond the ring .",
    "this model suggests that nuclear bars may not be an effective means of fueling active galactic nuclei ( agn ) as originally proposed by @xcite .    while the current generation of millimeter and submillimeter telescopes are not capable of resolving molecular gas on the parsec scales needed to resolve the agn fueling mechanisms directly , we can study the gas within the regions of the ilr . in this paper",
    "we present a detailed set of molecular gas data for a sample of double - barred galaxies . we have chosen 7 galaxies that are known to contain nuclear stellar bars based on their nir images",

    "the properties of these galaxies are summarized in table [ galaxytable ] .",
    "this sample will allow us to determine if variations in molecular gas properties are linked in some way to the wide variety of co morphologies in a sample of galaxies with similar nir morphologies , as hinted at by the models of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "in  [ obs ] we discuss the observations and data reduction techniques . in ",
    "[ phys ] we determine the molecular gas physical condition using the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) and large velocity gradient ( lvg ) approximations . in  [ morph ]",
    "we discuss observed correlations between our co line ratios with the high resolution co morphology and simulations of double - barred galaxies . in  [ disc1 ]",
    "we speculate on possible origins of the observed correlations .",
    "this work is summarized in  [ conc ] .",
    "the nuclei of seven double - barred galaxies were observed using the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) over the period of 1998 - 2001 .",
    "we have obtained @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21 , @xmath3co @xmath1=2@xmath21 , and @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22detections for all galaxies listed in table [ galaxytable ] except @xmath3co @xmath1=2@xmath21  in ngc 3081 .",
    "the half - power beam width of the jcmt is @xmath4 at 230 ghz ( @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21 ) and @xmath5 at 345 ghz ( @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22 ) . @xmath0co",
    "@xmath1=3@xmath22  data were obtained on a five - point cross offset by @xmath6 in order to allow convolution to match the 21@xmath7 beam of the jcmt at 230/220 ghz .",
    "all observations were obtained using the digital autocorrelation spectrometer in beam switching mode with a 180  throw .",
    "the calibration was monitored by frequently observing spectral line calibrators .",
    "the spectral line calibrators showed very little scatter from the published values with individual measurements differing by typically @xmath8 from standard spectra .",
    "thus , we adopt the nominal main beam efficiencies ( @xmath9 ) from the jcmt users guide of 0.69 at 230/220 ghz and 0.63 at 345 ghz .",
    "initially , similar data sets were averaged together using the software package specx .",
    "spectra were output to fits files and then the data were further reduced using the bell labs data reduction package comb .",
    "the data were binned to 10 km s@xmath10 resolution ( 7.8 and 11.5 mhz at 230 and 345 ghz respectively ) and zeroth or first order baselines were removed .",
    "the emitting regions were quite wide ( @xmath11 200 km s@xmath10 ) but the spectrometer bandwidth was at least 800 km s@xmath10 , which allowed for accurate baseline determination .",
    "the exception is ngc 5728 which had lines that were @xmath11 450 km s@xmath10  wide and for which the @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21  spectrum ran off the low velocity end of the spectrometer .",
    "for this reason , only the high velocity continuum was used in baseline removal for this galaxy .",
    "finally , the five @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22spectra for each galaxy were convolved to simulate a @xmath4 beam .",
    "the spectra for each galaxy are shown in figure [ spectra ] , and the spectral line intensities are summarized in table [ spectratable ] .",
    "the data were then binned to 20 km s@xmath10  resolution .",
    "this allowed the calculation of line ratios for each channel within the spectral line .",
    "the ratios for each channel were averaged using equal weights to obtain the final line ratios . only those channels with a signal - to - noise ratio of at least two in the line ratio were used in the calculation .",
    "the uncertainty in the line ratio is taken as the standard deviation of the mean . as a final step ,",
    "the spectra and line ratios were scaled to the main beam temperature scale using the appropriate values for @xmath9 ( see above ) .",
    "a summary of the line ratios is given in table [ ratiostable ] and channel by channel histograms of the ratios are shown in figure [ ratios ] .",
    "we note that the @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21spectral line for ngc 5728 is truncated somewhat ( see figure [ spectra ] ) .",
    "we feel that the truncation of the @xmath1=2@xmath21  spectra will have less effect on our co line ratios , since they were calculated channel by channel , rather than integrated intensity over the entire spectral line .",
    "the channel - by - channel @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratios for ngc 1097 and ngc 6951 shown in figure [ ratios ] show evidence for gradients .",
    "this may be caused by pointing offsets in the observations of one transition relative to the other , or may reflect a true gradient in excitation temperature across the nuclei of these galaxies .",
    "the individual line profiles for the central positions are similar in the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22  and @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21  data for these galaxies , suggesting that large pointing offsets are not present .",
    "evidence for similar gradients has been seen in the nearby starburst galaxy m82 @xcite and may be caused by variation in star formation strengths across the nuclei . in the case of ngc 1097 , the slight gradient could easily be produced by slight pointing offsets , but the gradient in ngc 6951 is strong enough that it may reflect true variations in excitation temperature across the nucleus of this galaxy . in either case , we are averaging the gas properties across the entire nucleus , so the gradients ( real or artificial ) will not significantly affect our results .    for  [ lvg ] , the large velocity gradient models contain four free parameters , so we need more line ratios in order to place stronger constraints on the molecular gas physical conditions .",
    "we have searched the literature and have obtained @xmath0co @xmath1=1@xmath20  line strengths for all galaxies except ngc 3081 .",
    "all @xmath0co @xmath1=1@xmath20  spectra were taken with the nobeyama radio observatory ( nro ) with 16  resolution except for ngc 2273 which was taken at the iram 30 m telescope with a 22  beam ( see table [ spectratable ] for references ) . since",
    "our jcmt @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21  data are taken at 21  resolution , we have created beam - matched @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=1@xmath20  ratios with the jcmt and nro data and divided them by our beam - matched @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  ratio . in the case of ngc 4736 , we used the @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21/@xmath1=1@xmath20  line ratio taken at iram with a 22  beam by @xcite ( since they did not publish the individual line strengths ) .",
    "for the line ratios we took from the literature or created using jcmt and published data , we adopt a 30% uncertainty to account for cross calibration uncertainties .",
    "all of these galaxies were initially chosen because the nir images suggested the presence of a nuclear stellar bar .",
    "the similarities in the nir images suggest that the gravitational potentials are similar in these galaxies ( see table [ nucleustable ] ) .",
    "models of double - barred galaxies indicate that the gas may behave differently within similar potentials if the gas properties are varied . in this section",
    ", we will model the co line ratios to determine the true physical conditions of the molecular gas , such as excitation temperature , kinetic temperature , density , and column density .",
    "determining the physical conditions of molecular clouds in other galaxies can be very difficult .",
    "for single dish observations , the beam size is usually larger than the angular diameter of typical molecular clouds , and so the line strengths are beam - diluted .",
    "in addition , molecular clouds are known to be very clumpy ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) and the high resolution @xmath0co @xmath1=1@xmath20  maps of the galaxies in our sample show a variety of distributions within the inner 21@xcite , so the average emission likely originates in a mixture of high and low density material with different beam filling factors . for extragalactic sources , the filling factor of the co emission within the primary beam may be small and is difficult to determine accurately .",
    "thus , for low resolution , single dish studies such as this one , it is preferable to study the ratios of line strength , rather than the individual fluxes .",
    "as long as the two co transitions are observed with the same size primary beam , the division of the two eliminates the unknown filling factor of the emission within the beam of the telescope ( assuming the two frequencies originate from the same region , which is likely true for these distant sources ) .",
    "the high resolution co maps of these galaxies suggest that most of the emission originates from the regions at or interior to the ilr ( as traced by star forming rings or the ends of nuclear bars ) .",
    "the exception is ngc 4736 for which at 4 mpc the 21primary beam of the jcmt does not cover the entire ilr region ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see figure [ radial ] ) . in all galaxies",
    "though , the jcmt beam entirely covers the strongest emission regions , which suggests that the physical conditions determined here represent a good approximation of the _ average _ gas properties within the ilr regions .",
    "in  [ lte ] we will analyze the line ratios under the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) approximation . in this model ( in addition to the unknown filling factor , @xmath12 ) , assumptions have to be made about the optical depth of the emission lines . in  [ lvg ]",
    "we will analyze the line ratios under the large velocity gradient ( lvg ) assumption , which is more complicated but does not require any assumption regarding optical depths .",
    "calibration differences between different telescopes can introduce ( often large ) uncertainties in spectral line ratios ( see discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "* for example ) . to prevent the introduction of such uncertainties",
    ", we will limit our analysis in ",
    "[ lte ] to the interpretation of only those co line ratios taken with the jcmt , namely @xmath3co/@xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21  and @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21 . in the lvg approximation",
    ", we will need more than two co line ratios to place strong constraints on the molecular gas conditions , so in  [ lvg ] we will use all of the line ratios listed in table [ ratiostable ] .      in the lte approximation",

    "there are generally three basic limits with which we are concerned :    1 .",
    "both lines are optically thick ( @xmath13 ) , in which case the integrated intensity line ratio ( e.g.  @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21 ) can be written as @xmath14 \\over{[j_{\\nu_{21}}(t_{21 } ) - j_{\\nu_{21}}(t_{\\rm bg } ) ] } } \\label{thickratio}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is proportional to the planck function ( see * ? ? ? * ) and @xmath16 k. in lte ( @xmath17 ) @xmath18 for @xmath19 k ( see figure [ lteplots ] ) .",

    "the ratio of @xmath23 s can be expressed as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath24 , co - specific constants , and the boltzmann equation ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "one line is optically thick and the other is optically thin , as is likely the case when we compare integrated intensity line ratios for different isotopomers of co in the same @xmath1 transition ( e.g.  @xmath3co/@xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21 ) .",
    "if we assume @xmath25 and that @xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21  is optically thick and @xmath3co @xmath1=2@xmath21  is optically thin , we have @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the @xmath0co/@xmath3co  abundance ratio ( which is measured to be 43 - 62 in the milky way ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "assuming optically thick @xmath0co  and optically thin @xmath3co  emission , the @xmath3co/@xmath0co @xmath1=2@xmath21line ratio suggests that the @xmath0co  optical depth in all six galaxies is consistent with @xmath29 .",
    "this indicates that the molecular gas is on the border between optically thin and optically thick in all of our galaxies .    in the lte approximation , we are unable to determine densities accurately , but we can say that , given the similarities in optical depth between the galaxies , the higher @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratios indicate warmer gas .",
    "we will discuss the implications of this in later sections .      as a double check of the lte analysis",
    ", we have performed a lvg analysis using a code written by lee mundy and implemented as part of the miriad data reduction package .",

    "the integrated intensity line ratios are shown as bands which indicate the @xmath3030% upper and lower limits of the line ratios .",

    "a single component model provided an adequate fit to the observed line ratios in most cases .",
    "there are four main variables in the lvg models : co column density per unit velocity ( @xmath31(co)@xmath32 ) , molecular hydrogen density ( @xmath33(h@xmath34 ) ) , kinetic temperature ( @xmath35 ) , and the @xmath0co/@xmath3co  abundance ratio ( [ @xmath0co]/[@xmath3co ] ) . with only three line ratios",

    ", we will assume that individual clouds in all galaxies have similar co line widths of 10 km s@xmath10 , similar to the milky way .    in the case of ngc 6951",
    ", our jcmt line ratios do not overlap in figure [ lvgplots ] .",
    "thus we can not place strong constraints on the gas properties in the center of this galaxy .",
    "the values listed in table [ lvgsols ] are determined using only the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio , and are not as firm as those determined for the other galaxies .",
    "adopting a line width of 10 km s@xmath10  gives co column densities of 10@xmath45 @xmath39 for most of the galaxies in our sample . in order for star formation to occur , it is believed that the molecular gas must exceed some critical column density .",

    "the @xmath48 , @xmath49 , and @xmath50 levels of co lie at 5.5 k , 17 k , and 33 k above the ground state , respectively .",
    "in addition , in the optically thin limit where all co emission escapes the cloud , the critical densities of h@xmath34 needed to collisionally excite @xmath0co  at the same rate that it spontaneously decays are @xmath44 10@xmath51 , 10@xmath52 , and 10@xmath53 @xmath39 for the @xmath1=1@xmath20 , @xmath1=2@xmath21 , and @xmath1=3@xmath22  transitions , respectively .",

    "this similarity in optical depths makes the conclusions regarding temperature and density drawn from the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio more convincing because we do not have to worry as much about variations in optical depth modifying the line ratio .",
    "the existence of nuclear stellar bars in these galaxies strongly suggests that all of them contain an ilr @xcite . based on existing data",

    "more detailed observations at high resolution of the dynamics of these galaxies are needed to confirm this , and thus validate the following discussion .",
    "the nuclear co morphology of ngc 5728 resembles a clumpy structure that is not centered on the galactic center .",

    "we note that it is more centrally concentrated than the bar - like features seen in co in ngc 2273 and ngc 470 .",
    "there are currently no published high resolution co maps of ngc 3081 and ngc 1097 ( likely because of their low declination ) . as such",

    "this is confirmed by the maps by @xcite , so we will include this galaxy in our comparisons .    the data in table [ ratiostable ] show evidence that galaxies containing elongated molecular bar - like features in their central regions have lower @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  integrated intensity line ratios .",
    "this effect is emphasized in figure [ radial ] where we show the azimuthally averaged @xmath0co @xmath1=1@xmath20  radial profile compared with the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio and the properties determined in  [ lte ] .",
    "the profiles are ordered in decreasing value of the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio .",
    "clearly the degree of central concentration increases as you reach the cooler gas near the bottom of the figure . in the lvg approximation ,",
    "the warmer and/or denser gas is at the top of the plot , and temperature and/or density decreases downward .",
    "we point out that there are resolution effects at work for the bottom three galaxies ( ngc 4736 , ngc 470 and ngc 2273 ) .",
    "since ngc 4736 is the closest galaxy in our sample , we are seeing it at the highest spatial resolution .",
    "thus , in ngc 4736 , our central peak appears much narrower than in ngc 2273 and ngc 470 , but in reality , the width of each central peak is comparable to the resolution limit of the interferometer with which they were observed . despite this",
    ", there is still an increasing tendency for the galaxies with lower @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21line ratios to have more centrally concentrated gas distributions , while the warmer ( and possibly denser ) gas appears to avoid the nucleus .",
    "possible causes for this effect are discussed in  [ disc1 ] .",
    "previous models have indicated that in order to create and sustain nuclear bars and rings , there must be some form of viscous gas component that can dissipate energy @xcite .",

    "some of these models have attempted to vary the gas viscosity parameter , which is usually assumed to be some numerical viscosity or some percentage of energy loss during cloud collision and kept constant for all trials .",
    "our observational result is the first indication that gas properties may be related to the variety of molecular gas morphologies seen in the centers of double - barred galaxies .    particularly relevant to this study",
    "are the studies of double - barred systems by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the motions of molecular gas in a double - barred potential and found that in galaxies with more viscous gas , the nuclear bar becomes kinematically separate from the main bar ( as predicted by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while in the less viscous model , the nuclear bar is actually rotating at the same pattern speed as the large - scale bar ( as predicted by * ? ? ?",
    ". in both cases , the molecular gas in the nucleus takes the form of a nuclear bar .",
    "we do not see these nuclear gas bars in all of the co maps , so it is difficult to compare the observations with these models .",
    "@xcite modeled the gas response to a double - barred potential that could possibly be the result of purely stellar orbits . in this model ,",
    "the gas distribution need not resemble the stellar distribution . in their models",
    ", they find that the double - barred potential is not capable of transporting molecular gas into the nucleus with the efficiency predicted by @xcite .",
    "the gas still becomes trapped at the ilr , unless they increase the sound speed . in the simulations with higher sound speeds , the gas is capable of flowing all the way into the nucleus .",
    "it is interesting to note that our observations suggest that the galaxies with centrally concentrated gas distributions contain cooler , less dense gas , which could correspond to a higher sound speed .",
    "thus , the gas in our double - barred galaxies may be flowing inward more efficiently in the galaxies with higher sound speeds as predicted by the models of @xcite , resulting in the more centrally concentrated co profiles .",
    "however , until we can accurately measure the sound speed , this conclusion must remain rather speculative .",
    "it seems more likely , though , that the variations in the gas distributions are affected strongly by star formation activity , which is not yet accounted for in these models .",
    "future models of double - barred galaxies will need to include the effects of star formation in order to determine its effect on the flow of molecular gas into the centers of double - barred galaxies .",
    "we were unable to find estimates of the star formation rates ( sfr ) of all these galaxies at high resolution using the same technique . in an attempt to keep the data sets used to compare the properties of the galaxies in our sample as uniform as possible ,",
    "we have estimated the sfrs from the iras fluxes .",
    "while this may be the most accurate method for these dusty star forming galaxy centers @xcite , the large beam of the iras satellite means that in all cases we are likely measuring the global sfr rather than the rates for the inner 21  ( the beam size of the jcmt ) . for",
    "now , we will assume that the majority of the star formation in these galaxies is occurring in the central few kiloparsecs .",
    "to estimate the sfr , we use the iras 60 @xmath56 m and 100 @xmath56 m fluxes to determine the infrared luminosity as described in @xcite .",
    "we then convert this luminosity to a star formation rate using the technique described in @xcite . to test the accuracy of our method , we compared the star formation rates for the entire galaxies determined from the iras fluxes to the direct measurement for the star formation rates using h@xmath57 data for the inner 45  of a sample of different galaxies in @xcite .",
    "we find that our star formation rates are generally @xmath58 times higher than those determined by @xcite , with somewhat larger discrepancies ( up to 5 times higher ) for the galaxies with low rates ( @xmath59 m@xmath60yr@xmath10 ) .    in figure [ sfr ]",
    "we see that the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio tends to be higher in the galaxies that show higher star formation rates .",
    "given that we are likely overestimating the star formation rates of ngc 4736 and ngc 2273 to a higher degree than we are for ngc 5728 and ngc 6951 ( for reasons described in the previous paragraph ) it is likely that our result will hold when using a different technique to determine the star formation rates .",
    "it is interesting to note that the variation in the gas properties with star formation activity discussed above , in conjunction with the correlation noted in ",
    "[ morph ] ( and shown in figure [ radial ] ) indicates that the galaxies with higher star formation rates are depleted of molecular gas in their centers .",
    "one possible cause could be that the star formation and subsequent regions and supernovae deplete , photo - dissociate , and disrupt the clouds , leaving the galaxies with higher star formation rates more gas deficient in the nucleus , while heating and compressing the surrounding molecular gas . without uniform ,",
    "high resolution observations of the star formation rates and locations , we can not draw any firm conclusions from this analysis .      in the previous section we assumed that the dynamics in these galaxies were similar based on the similarity of the nir images .",
    "there are several unmeasured quantities that can change the central gas dynamics of these galaxies .",
    "one example is the bar pattern speed . changing the pattern speed , will change the strength of the ilr .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that the variation in gas distributions are caused by different strength ilrs .",
    "if this is the case , then the variations in star formation activity may be caused by the locations of the peaks in the gas distributions .",
    "for example , if the majority of gas is located at the ilr radius ( a local stable point ) it may be able to accumulate until it exceeds the critical density needed for star formation to occur ( see , for example * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "conversely , if the ilr is weak , the majority of the gas could accumulate in the central regions of the galaxy , where the local epicycle frequency ( hence , critical density ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) may be high enough to inhibit strong star formation in these galaxies .",
    "this may result in higher star formation rates in galaxies like ngc 6951 and ngc 1097 where the gas is concentrated near the ilr @xcite than those galaxies with strong central concentration such as ngc 4736 @xcite .",
    "a detailed study of a larger sample of galaxies combined with a more detailed analysis of the star formation histories and dynamics of these galaxies will help clarify this picture among double - barred galaxies .",
    "we have taken @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22 , @xmath3co @xmath1=3@xmath22 , and @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22  spectra of the ilr regions of a sample of galaxies that show a double - barred nucleus in the near infrared .",
    "we find that that @xmath0co/@xmath3co @xmath1=2@xmath21  integrated intensity line ratio is uniform at the 2@xmath28 level while the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio varies dramatically from galaxy to galaxy .",
    "we find that the co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio is higher in galaxies with non - centralized co distributions and lower in galaxies that contain centralized concentrations .",
    "the uniform @xmath0co/@xmath3co @xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratios suggest that the molecular gas is marginally optically thick , with @xmath61 in all galaxies .",
    "the similarity in optical depths suggests that the variation in the @xmath0co @xmath1=3@xmath22/@xmath1=2@xmath21  line ratio is indicating real variations in the gas properties .",
    "this result suggests that the molecular gas is cooler and/or less dense in galaxies that contain central concentrations and warmer and/or denser in galaxies with less centrally concentrated co distributions .",
    "there is some evidence that the star formation rates are higher in the galaxies that have warmer / denser , non - centrally concentrated gas distributions .",
    "this result suggests that the star formation activity may be depleting the central gas while heating and compressing the surrounding molecular gas resulting the the observed variety of gas distributions and physical conditions .",
    "it is also possible that bar dynamics alone is responsible for modifying the gas distributions , densities , and star formation rates . in this scenario",
    "the enhanced star formation is the result of stronger ilrs allowing molecular gas to accumulate to high ( super - critical ) densities near the ilr radius . a more detailed study of the star formation activity and internal dynamics of these galaxies at higher resolution is needed to disentangle these .",
    "it seems evident based on these observations that future models of double - barred galaxies will need to include star formation in order to disentangle the effects of dynamics and star formation activity .",
