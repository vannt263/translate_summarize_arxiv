    "blue stragglers ( bss ) are stars that have remained on the main sequence for a time exceeding that expected , for their masses , from standard stellar evolution theory .",
    "the existence of bss indicates an incomplete understanding of stellar evolution and also of star formation within clusters @xcite . *",
    "since * they are bright and blue , these objects may affect the integrated spectra of their host clusters by contributing excess spectral energy in the blue and ultraviolet .",
    "bss are therefore important in studies of population synthesis @xcite .",
    "much evidence shows that these strange objects are relevant to primordial binaries @xcite .",
    "binary coalescence from a contact binary is a popular hypothesis for single bss and it is believed that these contact binaries are mainly from case a mass transfer @xcite .",
    "mass transfer is another channel to produce bss from primordial binaries . during roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) , the less massive star accretes some material and goes upward along the main sequence , if it is still a main - sequence star .",
    "the accreting component may then be observed as a bs when it is more massive than the turnoff of the host cluster @xcite .",
    "previous studies show that both case a and case b mass transfer are only responsible for some short- and mid - period bss @xcite , which are rare in some old open clusters , and case c mass transfer may account for bss in long - orbital period spectroscopic binaries . during rlof , the orbital period will decrease at first , however , if the primary continues to transfer material to the companion after the primary is less massive than the secondary , the binary will become wider and the orbital period will increase . since dynamical instability often happens when the mass donor is a giant star , there is little work to focus on for this channel to bss .    as is well known , a fully convective star will increase in radius with mass loss and decrease in roche lobe radius if it is more massive than its accreting companion * @xcite*. this means that the mass donor will overfill its roche lobe by an ever - increasing amount , leading to mass transfer on a dynamical time - scale , the formation of a common envelope ( ce ) and a spiral - in phase . the critical mass ratio ( the mass donor /the accretor )",
    "is about 2/3 from a polytropic model with a polytropic index @xmath2 for conservative mass transfer , indicating that mass transfer would be dynamically unstable if the mass donor has a mass larger than 2/3 of the mass of the companion star .",
    "if stellar wind is not included before rlof to decrease the primary s mass , case c mass transfer is always dynamically unstable for a binary with initial mass ratio @xmath3 ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the * initial * masses of the primary and of the secondary , respectively ) , and * therefore makes no contribution to bss .",
    "* however , there are some problems when we use the * above criterion * in a real binary system for the following facts .",
    "( 1 ) giant stars have large condensed cores ( usually they are degenerate ) , so they can not be modelled by a fully convective star .",
    "the critical mass ratio increases substantially because of the condensed core @xcite .",
    "they conform to the formula as follows@xcite :    @xmath7    where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are * the core mass and the total mass , respectively , of the donor as rlof begins .",
    "* ( 2 ) the condition for dynamical instability also depends on the amount of mass and angular momentum loss during rlof . assuming that the lost mass carries away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to the mass donor , soberman et al .",
    "gave a fitted roche lobe mass - radius exponent @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is mass transfer efficiency determined as the mass fraction of the lost mass from the primary accreted by the secondary .",
    "we * may then * obtain the critical mass ratio @xmath0 by setting the adiabatic mass - radius exponent @xmath12 , where @xmath13 can be fitted from the data of * numerical calculations of * hjellming & webbink and soberman et al .",
    "( see also han et al .",
    "[ qc ] clearly shows the dependence of @xmath0 on the mass transfer efficiency @xmath11 . ( 3 ) stellar wind prior to rlof , which will be strongly enhanced due to the tidal interaction with the companion , will increase the core fraction in equation ( 1 ) and allow the system to * stabilize * more easily .",
    "possibly , a more fundamental problem of such a criterion is that it does not take into account the detailed dynamics of the mass transfer process .",
    "there are some systems , * observationally , * which should experience dynamical mass transfer while appearing to avoid a ce phase @xcite .",
    "several recent full binary evolution calculations also show that the simplistic criterion above is not really appropriate .",
    "for example , it is shown by podsiadlowski et al . that mass transfer is dynamically stable for all giants up to a mass of about @xmath14 , in the case of giants transferring mass to a neutron star of @xmath15 . the study of han et al . showed that @xmath0 may be up to about 1.3 as @xmath16 .    in this paper",
    ", we will study the critical mass ratio for dynamical stability in mass transfer from a giant star to a main sequence companion from detailed binary evolutions , and adopt the results to estimate the contribution to bss from the mass transfer . in section 2",
    ", we simply describe the numerical codes we have employed * in the study .",
    "the results * of the critical mass ratio are shown in section 3 . in section 4 ,",
    "we show some examples of binaries which eventually form long orbital period bss .",
    "the consequences from monte carlo simulations are shown in section 5 .",
    "discussions and conclusions are given in section 6 .",
    "the binary evolution code we employed was originally developed by eggleton , which has been updated with the latest input physics over the last three decades as described by han et al . and pols . some characteristics of the code , i.e. a self - adaptive non - lagrangian mesh , the treatment of both the convective and semi - convective mixing as diffusion processes , the simultaneous and implicit solution of both the stellar structure equations and the chemical composition equations , etc .",
    "make the code very stable and easy to use .",
    "the current code uses an equation of state that includes pressure ionization and coulomb interaction , recent opacity tables derived from rogers & iglesias and alexander & ferguson ( see chen & tout , 2007 ) , nuclear reaction rates from caughlan et al . and caughlan & fowler , and neutrino loss rates from itoh et al .",
    "the ratio of mixing length to the local pressure scaleheight @xmath17 is set to 2 , which fits to the sun @xcite .",
    "convective overshooting is included by incorporating a condition that mixing occurs in a region with @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the ratio of radiative pressure to gas pressure and @xmath20 is a specified constant .",
    "@xmath21 gives the best fit to the observed systems @xcite , which corresponds to an overshooting of about 0.25@xmath22 .",
    "rlof is included from the boundary condition @xmath23,\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are the radii of the mass donor and its roche lobe , respectively .",
    "@xmath26 gives the mass loss rate of the primary , and @xmath27 is a constant . in our study , we set @xmath28 , with which rlof proceeds steadily and the lobe - filling star overfills its roche lobe as necessary but never overfills its lobe by much , typically @xmath29 .    if mass transfer is non - conservative , i.e. @xmath11 is less than 1.0 , some matter will * be lost * from the system , taking away some angular momentum . in our study ,",
    "the accretor is a main - sequence star , and it is much * more compact * than a giant .",
    "so we assume that the lost mass carries away the same specific angular momentum as pertains to that of the accretor , similar to the case of a compact component . the study of beer et al .",
    "shows that this assumption is appropriate for main - sequence components .",
    "we only follow the evolution of the primary ( initially more massive component ) in a binary system when we study the critical mass ratio , since the structure of the primary is the main factor for the formation of ce in this phase . *",
    "we adopted the solar metallicity ( @xmath30 ) in our calculations . * as we are mainly concerned * with bss which originate from mass transfer , * only low- and intermediate - mass binaries are studied here .",
    "the initial mass of the primary increases from 1 to @xmath31 by step of about @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath5=1.00 , 1.26 , 1,58 , 2.00 , 2.51 , 3.20 , 3.98 , 4.95 , 6.31 and @xmath33 , respectively ) .",
    "when the mass donor evolves to * the * giant branch , it dramatically expands , and then its radius @xmath34 may well represent the evolutionary phases .",
    "so we systematically vary the radius of the mass donor at the onset of rlof , since the primary is just filling of its roche lobe at that time .",
    "if the mass ratio @xmath35 is given , the corresponding initial orbital separation @xmath36 can be calculated from @xmath37 $ ] ( eggleton , 1983 ) . for convenience ,",
    "we only show the radius of the primary at the onset of rlof in this paper . * ] and the mass of the companion star for each primary mass .",
    "if @xmath38 , the primary has * a * degenerate he core and undergoes * a * he flash as * the * central he is ignited . before the he flash , the star can approach a very high luminosity as well as a very large radius .",
    "so we choose an increase of the radius @xmath39 by * steps * of 0.2 from the base of the first giant branch ( fgb ) to the tip of * the * fgb to study the critical mass ratio .",
    "when @xmath40 , he burns quietly in the center and the radius difference of the primary from the base to the tip of fgb is not very large .",
    "we therefore set @xmath41 for this case .",
    "if a star has not * filled * its roche lobe before central he burning , it will not * fill * its roche lobe * during * he burning , because the star will contract after he ignition .",
    "we * therefore * have not considered the he - burning phase in the studies .",
    "after the exhaustion of * its * central he , the star expands again and its radius may become larger than that at the tip of * the * fgb .",
    "if @xmath42 , we continue the study on * the * agb when the stellar radius equals to that at the tip of * the fgb * , and increase the radius by * steps * of @xmath41 .",
    "[ grid ] shows the positions of the primaries as rlof begins , corresponding stellar radii are presented in table 1 .",
    "if @xmath43 , the code breaks down when the he flash occurs . to investigate the case on * the * agb for * a * mass donor with @xmath44 , we constructed some stellar models after * the * he flash .",
    "considering that some of the mass donors on * the * agb may have evolved from some initially more massive stars , becomes less than @xmath14 because of stellar wind , then * the star has * not passed through a phase with a high radius before he burning .",
    "] we choose the point at the minimum stellar radius at the tip of * the * fgb for stars with @xmath45 ( i.e. @xmath46 ) to start our studies and increase the radius by * steps * of @xmath47 .",
    "the stellar radii and corresponding @xmath1 are listed in table 2 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the contribution to bss from eagb+ms , in comparison to that of tpagb+ms , is very small , although the value of @xmath0 for eagb+ms is likely larger than that of tpagb+ms because of the small radii at the onset of rlof .",
    "this is relevant to the mass loss by wind prior to rlof during the two phases .",
    "the stellar wind is generally much less in eagb than that in tpagb .",
    "our study indicates that the mass loss prior to rlof during eagb phase is usually not enough to make @xmath48 , while * a lot of * matter in the envelope of the primary has left the system by wind prior to rlof for binaries of tpagb+ms .",
    "so * for systems of tpagb+ms , the mass transfer is easily stabilized and leads to * the formation of long - orbital period binaries after rlof .",
    "the influence of @xmath11 on the bs formation from tpagb+ms binaries is non - monotonic , i.e .",
    "the bs number first increases , and then decreases with the increase of @xmath11 ( see table [ 6 ] ) .",
    "this non - monotonic phenomenon is induced by the criterion of @xmath0 and the mass of the ms companion after accretion . with the increase of @xmath11 ,",
    "@xmath0 becomes smaller and smaller , which leads @xmath48 to be fulfilled * more unlikely * , but the ms companion may accrete more material from the primary to increase the mass to be larger than the turn - off of the cluster .",
    "the results of table [ 6 ] indicate that , when @xmath49 , the mass of the ms companion is the main factor to determine the formation of bs from this way , but the dynamical instability is the crucial * factor * when @xmath50 .    from fig .",
    "[ m2p3 ] we see that , for the bss from mass transfer between an fgb star and a ms companion , their masses increase and the range of the orbital period becomes narrower ( mainly some long orbital period bss disappear ) with the increasing @xmath11 , since a large @xmath11 means more matter accreted by the secondary ( leading to a larger final mass ) and less angular momentum lost from the system ( resulting in a shorter orbital period ) .",
    "furthermore , a long - orbital period indicates a larger stellar radius at the onset of rlof , and then a smaller @xmath0 as shown in section 3 .",
    "therefore , with the increase of @xmath11 , the rlof in relatively long - orbital - period binaries firstly changes from dynamically stable to dynamically unstable , * and * directly leads to the disappearance of long - orbital - period bss .",
    "the orbital period of the bss from this * channel * has a wide range , i.e. from several days to hundreds of days for @xmath51 .",
    "however , bss with @xmath52 days can only be produced when @xmath53 and their masses are near the turnoff because only a very small fraction of the lost matter from the primary is accreted by the secondary .",
    "all the possible candidates contributing to bss in m67 from fgb+ms are low - mass binaries , since the secondaries from intermediate - mass fgb+ms binaries have left the main sequence at 4 gyr . for a @xmath14 star ,",
    "the minimum mass of the secondary is about @xmath54 for @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "the stars with this mass have left the main sequence in the old open cluster .",
    "different from the case of fgb+ms , the bss resulting from eagb+ms and tpagb+ms have similar orbital periods for various @xmath11 ( see figs .",
    "[ m2p5 ] and [ m2p6 ] ) . meanwhile , the mass difference of the bss from different @xmath11 is also not as obvious as that from fgb+ms binaries .",
    "* in the cases of eagb+ms and tpagb+ms , some bss have masses similar to those from fgb+ms , and some have lower masses , when @xmath11 is larger than 0.1 . the lower mass bss mix with those from @xmath11 with lower than the given value .",
    "stellar wind may account for this consequence .",
    "when the primary evolves from fgb to eagb , then to tpagb , its mass becomes less and less due to stellar wind .",
    "correspondingly , the minimum mass of the ms companion for stable mass transfer also becomes smaller .",
    "the companions may then have lower masses after rlof with evolution . as a result , the masses of blue stragglers in figs .",
    "15 and 16 extend to lower values than those in fig.14 . *    from the * criteria * of * the * polytropic model and hurley et al .",
    ", only long - orbital period bss ( with orbital period greater than 1600 d ) may be produced from giants transferring matter to the ms companions .",
    "since case a and early case b ( the mass donor is during hertzsprung gap at the onset of rlof ) mass transfer are only responsible for some short- and mid - period bss ( up to 100 d , chen & han , 2004 ) , there seems to be a period gap of hundreds days from the two * criteria * above .",
    "however , this period gap will not appear from the criterion of this paper .",
    "the bss from different giant binaries cover the period range from several days to thousands of days ( see figs .",
    "[ m2p3 ] to [ m2p6 ] ) .    as an example",
    ", we show the mass ratio versus the mass of bss for the case of tpagb+ms binaries at the onset and at the termination of rlof in fig .",
    "[ m2q6 ] . from the figure",
    ", we see that the mass ratio at the onset of rlof is located in a triangle region , where the upper boundary is determined by the dynamical instability and the lower boundary is dertermined by the mass of the accretor after the rlof .",
    "we have not included example 3 in section 4 in the above study .",
    "systematic investigation for this case is difficult at present , since we have little knowledge * of * the conditions for binaries to avoid ce during initially dynamically unstable rlof .",
    "the conditions are possibly relevant to the parameters such as the mass ( and the core mass ) of the primary , the mass ratio of the components , the orbital period etc .. furthermore , it may also be affected by the detailed process of mass transfer .",
    "the study of the conditions is beyond the scope of * this * paper . if case 3 is a real case , only a very small fraction ( less than 1 per cent ) from those with dynamically unstable rlof is enough to produce bss in m67 .",
    "the products here have much longer main - sequence lives in comparison to those from dynamically stable rlof , since the secondaries in general have much lower mass due to the initially large mass ratio ( greater than @xmath0 ) and are less evolved before rlof . from table",
    "[ 2 ] , we see that at @xmath57 , a star with @xmath58 has already formed and it becomes a bs when @xmath59 . is for a cluster with a turnoff of around @xmath58.]the material around the bss might give us some clues on their parent stars .",
    "several works focus on the bss in m67 from observations @xcite . in the new catalogue of bss in open clusters @xcite , there are 30 bss in this old open cluster .",
    "since * there is * no orbital information for these bss in ahumada & lapasset , the main observational data we adopted here are from some earlier studies .",
    "milone & latham reported the radial velocities for 13 bss in the open cluster m67 according to observations * over * about 9 years .",
    "three of the 13 bss rotate too rapidly to allow reliable velocity determinations @xcite .",
    "among the ten bss left , only one ( f190 ) shows a short orbital period , about 4.2 d , while five * have * long - orbital periods in the range from 800 to 5000 d. the other four bss are considered as single stars by some studies ( e.g hurley et al . , 2001 ) .",
    "three of the five long - orbital period bss have obvious orbital eccentricities and the other two are in near - circular orbits .",
    "sandquist & shetrone presented an analysis of the time series photometry of m67 for w uma systems , bss and related objects .",
    "there are 24 possible bss observed in their study and most of them show no variation in * their * light curves .",
    "two bss , s968 and s1263 , which * were * considered as single stars before , are possible variables in the study of sandquist & shetrone .",
    "the bss resulting from the criterion of hurley et al .",
    "have orbital periods beyond 1600 d ( @xmath60 as seen in fig .",
    "[ h2 ] ) . however , four of the five observed long - orbital period bss have orbital periods less than this value .",
    "the simulation from the polytropic model * gives * a similar result .",
    "the bss from the criterion of this paper may well cover the orbital period range , but it seems that none of the five bss is from the mass transfer between an fgb and a ms , since the smallest orbital period is 846 d ( @xmath61 ) , which is far greater than the maximum orbital period resulting from the fgb+ms binaries , as seen in fig .",
    "the bss with mid orbital period ( i.e. from tens of days to hundreds of days ) are possibly from * fgbs transferring matter to their ms companions * , but it needs more observational evidence to comfirm the existence of these bss .    the orbital eccentricity is a puzzle from mass transfer , since the orbit should be circularized by tidal interaction of the two components of a binary , which is just undergoing , or after , rlof . some studies considered that dynamical collision is necessary to explain the observed orbital eccentricities .",
    "recently , marinovic et al . found that , due to the enhanced mass loss of the agb component at orbital phases closer to the periastron , the net eccentricity growth rate in one orbit is comparable to the rate of tidal circularisation in many cases .",
    "they reproduced the orbital period and eccentricity of * the * sirius system with this eccentricity enhancing mechanism .",
    "their study provides an explanation for the eccentricities of long - orbital period bss without dynamical collision .",
    "our study shows that the critical mass ratio , @xmath0 , for dynamically stable mass transfer between a giant star and a ms companion depends on the stellar radius at the onset of mass transfer . for * any given * mass , a more evolved star is less stable for rlof , since the evolutionary timescale for a more evolved star is shorter and hence the mass transfer rate is higher than that * for less - evolved ones*. the results including stellar wind @xcite are consistent with the tendency in this paper , except for * cases where @xmath62 * , which have a larger @xmath63 and a larger @xmath0 in comparison to those of @xmath64 .",
    "the behaviour of the cases of @xmath62 here is similar to the consequences of a polytropic model .",
    "meanwhile , from table 3 in the paper of han et al . , we see that , _ at a similar core mass _ , * binaries * with a low primary mass ( or a large @xmath63 ) * have larger @xmath0 , also * consistent with equation(1 ) except for the binaries with @xmath65 . our results for @xmath16 in this paper",
    "* match those * of han et al .",
    "( see the upper panel of fig.[low - fit ] ) .",
    "due to the various core masses , however , the dependance of @xmath0 on @xmath63 is completely scattered as shown in the upper panel of fig.[low - fit ] .",
    "so , it is very likely that both @xmath8 and @xmath63 have influences on @xmath0 , but the effect is different for binaries * of different * masses , i.e. @xmath8 dominates the case * where * the primary s mass * is * larger than @xmath66 while @xmath63 is critical for the less * massive * ones . the thickness of the envelope might be an important cause here and the transition is possibly a gradual process .",
    "the non - monotonic behaviour of @xmath67 results from the low degeneracy degree of the core in * primaries * with this mass .    * from the criterion in this paper , we obtained some bss with intermediate orbital period when @xmath11 is less than 0.4 .",
    "however , there is no one reported at present located in the orbital period range from fgb+ms binaries , as we compare our results to observations .",
    "there might be two factors for this contradiction .",
    "one is the fact that the mass of the bss formed from such a low @xmath11 is very close to the turnoff of m67 , making them hard to distinguish from normal stars around the turnoff ( as seen in figure 14 ) .",
    "the other might be that the value of @xmath11 is substantially larger than 0.1 during mass transfer between fgb stars and ms companions in a real case , so few bss are produced in this way .",
    "orbital determinations ( in the future ) might provide some constraints on the value of @xmath11 .",
    "for example , since the products of fgb+ms have a wide range of orbital periods , from several days to hundreds of days , there would be some bss with intermediate orbital periods ( if @xmath11 is low enough ) , which are possibly absent from the criterion of hurley et al . .",
    "*    the possibility that a main sequence star becomes a bs via wind accretion was first suggested by williams .",
    "this idea lacked attention for a long time , since an isolated star can hardly accrete enough matter to become a bs .",
    "however it is likely different if the main sequence star is bound in a binary system where the primary is undergoing a large mass loss . in general , the mass loss rate of stellar wind is in the range of @xmath68 to @xmath69 as a star approaches * the tip of the agb * , and some fraction of the lost material ( up to 10 per cent , tom et al . 1996 ) * is * probably accreted by its companion .",
    "this means that the secondary may significantly increase its mass when the primary undergoes a large mass loss at the tip of * the * agb .",
    "although the mass increase is likely not enough to produce a bs , the secondary still has chances to obtain matter from the primary in the following stable rlof if it happens .",
    "so bss with very long orbital periods ( greater than 1000 days ) are likely the consequences of both rlof and wind accretion .    in * this * paper",
    "we present an example of a binary which avoids ce formation from initially dynamically unstable rlof and eventually evolves to a bs with a long orbital period . *",
    "we * only assume that * a * ce has not formed in the initially dynamically unstable rlof , but no critical conditions are shown . how to discriminate whether * a * ce has developed or not during this phase is unclear , as mentioned in section 5 .",
    "many parameters , such as the mass ( and the core mass ) of the primary , the mass ratio of the components , the orbital period * etc*. are relevant to this condition , which * is * also affected by the detailed process of mass transfer .",
    "the study * of * this will be * complex * and difficult , while interesting .",
    "as long as the possibility of this case exists , only a very * small fraction of systems * with dynamically unstable rlof may provide an important contribution to bss .",
    "mass transfer efficiency , @xmath11 , is an important parameter .",
    "both the criterion of dynamical instability , @xmath0 , and the final mass of the accretor , @xmath70 ( * which are the two critical characters to determine the formation of a bs * ) are relevant to this parameter . from our simulation for m67 ,",
    "the peak of the contribution from fgb+ms binaries is * probably * about @xmath51 , with which the bs mass is near @xmath71 . with the increase of @xmath11 ,",
    "the orbital period decreases and the bs mass increases , as was explained in section 5 .",
    "however it is unclear * what the value of @xmath11 is * in binaries . in general",
    ", @xmath11 will be very small for rlof in binaries with a giant mass donor and a compact companion @xcite .",
    "so @xmath70 will not be very large , * similar to the turnoff mass .",
    "*    the detailed evolution calculations in the paper show that @xmath1 decreases with the stellar radii of the primaries at the onset of rlof , except for cases at or near the base of * the * giant branch , where the core is not very degenerate and the envelope is not yet fully convective . non - conservative assumptions will strongly affect @xmath0 while stellar wind before mass transfer has little influence on it . to conveniently use the result",
    "we give a fit of @xmath0 as a function of the stellar radius of the primary at the onset of rlof , and of the mass transfer efficiency during rlof .",
    "theoretically , dynamically stable mass transfer occurs once the mass ratio is less than the critical * value*. however , it is delayed in real binaries . usually the stable mass transfer occurs after the reversion of the mass ratio .",
    "the monte carlo simulations show that some binaries with the mass donor * on * the first giant branch , which have no contributions to the blue stragglers from the earlier * criteria * , will contribute to this population with the criterion obtained in this paper .",
    "meanwhile , from our criterion , the blue stragglers resulting from the mass transfer between an agb star and a ms companion may be more numerous and have a wider range of orbital periods than those * formed from previous criteria*. although the result from our criterion may well cover the observed orbital period range , it seems that none of the five observed long - orbital period bss is from the mass transfer between an fgb and a ms companion .",

    "<S> binary population synthesis shows that mass transfer from a giant star to a main - sequence ( ms ) companion may account for some observed long - orbital period blue stragglers . </S>",
    "<S> however , little attention * is paid to this blue straggler formation scenario * as dynamical instability often happens when the mass donor is a giant star . in this paper , we have studied the critical mass ratio , @xmath0 , for dynamically stable mass transfer from a giant star to a ms companion using detailed evolution calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the results show that a more evolved star is generally less stable for roche lobe overflow . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , @xmath1 almost linearly increases with the amount of the mass and angular momentum * lost * during mass transfer , but has little dependance on stellar wind . to conveniently use the result , we give a fit of @xmath0 as a function of the stellar radius at the onset of roche lobe overflow and of the mass transfer efficiency during the roche lobe overflow .    to examine the formation of blue stragglers from mass transfer between giants and ms stars , we have performed monte carlo simulations with various @xmath0 . * </S>",
    "<S> the simulations show that some binaries with the mass donor on the first giant branch may contribute to blue stragglers with @xmath0 obtained in this paper but will not from previous @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , from our @xmath0 , blue stragglers from the mass transfer between an agb star and a ms companion may be more numerous and have a wider range of orbital periods than those from the other @xmath0 . *    binaries : close -stars : evolution - blue stragglers </S>"
