    "the cosmic ray composition near the knee region ( @xmath0 up to almost @xmath1 ) is a challenging problem @xcite .",
    "recent measurements by kascade @xcite have suggested an increased proportion of heavier nuclei in cosmic ray flux at these energies .",
    "however , these results are still far from conclusive as the results derived from electron , muon and hadron data differ and the composition measurements from cerenkov arrays show even decreasing trend @xcite,@xcite .",
    "although more precise determination of the chemical composition is not yet feasible , the presence of @xmath2 nuclei at @xmath3 level in the primary flux at @xmath4 seems quite plausible .",
    "this result presents an interesting opportunity to observe iron  nitrogen and iron  oxygen nucleus - nucleus interactions at energies beyond the possibilities of terrestrial accelerators .",
    "though both @xmath5 and @xmath6 are light nuclei may also happen but these are suppressed by a factor larger than @xmath7 100 according to corsika simulations .",
    "] , the number of participating nucleons in head - on collisions with iron nuclei may go upto several tens .",
    "thus , given the very high energy per nucleon available with the incoming iron nuclei , the formation of quark - gluon plasma seems to be a likely possibility in a fraction of the primary interactions .",
    "although the baryon density is only half of the density in pb - pb interactions ( due to the interaction with lighter nuclei ) , the energy density @xmath8 can reach sufficiently high value .",
    "this will be shown in section  [ secs ] the conditions in which such interactions are taking place are unique .",
    "however they provide an opportunity to investigate some characteristics of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) which are not available presently in terrestrial experiments .",
    "the interactions of iron nuclei take place at altitudes higher than 20 km and secondary charged pions have large probability to decay into muons due to the thin air at these altitudes .",
    "while the decay products of neutral pions undergo further interactions leading to the development and absorption of the electron - photon casacde in the middle and lower atmosphere , the muons , in some sense , decouple from the shower development and are subjected only to energy loss through ionization and multiple scattering .",
    "moreover , the large lorentz factor helps in keeping the secondary particles collimated within a narrow cone . as a result",
    ", there is a possibility to observe differences in the characteristics of the muon component in some extensive air showers from what one would expect on the basis of standard models of high energy interactions .",
    "the fact that the hard component of muons in extensive air showers carries information on the pion production in the initial stages of the shower development is of great importance .",
    "hence , aside from qgp , it is also interesting to study the sensitivity of energetic muons to the details of the primary interaction dynamics . in this regard",
    "the qgp effects observed in the muon component of air showers will also indicate the extent of the above mentioned sensitivity .",
    "of course it is necessary to determine in more quantitative way the notion of hard component in terms of energy and the methodology to observe it .",
    "one simple method is to place a large area high resolution muon detectors underground at such depth that the overburden will filter out the less energetic muons and preferentially provide the information on the initial interaction .    due to the absence of a comprehensive theory on the formation and evolution of qgp and also due to the lack of solid experimental evidence",
    "there are many phenomenological models with quite different and sometimes even opposite predictions .",
    "the same is also true for results on secondary particles multiplicity .",
    "there are predictions of a decrease of multiplicity @xcite in high energy nuclear collisions . on the other hand , many statistical thermal models predict increase of multiplicity @xcite . anyway",
    "the secondary particle multiplicity is an important variable and a change in the interaction dynamics may be observable through change in the characteristics of particle production , depending on the size of the effect and the sensitivity of measurements .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study such phenomena through detailed simulations and to learn about conditions necessary to observe at least some of the features which would reveal the formation of qgp in cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere . to achieve this , a very simple model of qgp formation",
    "is presented in section  [ secs ] this model is then used to simulate the formation of qgp and the results are compared with the outcome of programs currently used for simulations of extensive air showers .",
    "the analysis of simulated data and comparisons are presented in section  [ secr ] the conclusions are discussed in the final section .",
    "the standard package used for simulation of cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere is the program corsika @xcite supplemented by several models of high energy interactions of elementary particles .",
    "the properties of these models have been extensively studied in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "good agreement with experimental data of kascade has been achieved using qgsjet @xcite and venus @xcite models with qgsjet giving somewhat better results .",
    "venus predicts slightly larger number of muons per shower than qgsjet at energies in the range , @xmath9 .",
    "as this feature might blur or hide the muon component contributed by the qgp , the venus model has been used for comparisons while searching for the observable effects due to the qgp .",
    "another reason for this choice is the availability of good documentation for venus and the fact that qgp simulations supplemented by venus simulations were possible without any intervention with the venus code .",
    "the key factor in qgp modelling is the number of nucleons , @xmath10 , participating in the first interaction of an iron nucleus with the atmospheric nucleus .",
    "if @xmath10 is larger than a certain limit , @xmath11 , nucleons are supposed to melt down into qgp .",
    "the values for the fraction of melted nucleons used in simulations were 10 % , 20 % and 40 % and the corresponding threshold values of @xmath10 were chosen to be 13 , 15 and 19 nucleons .",
    "we shall denote this fraction as @xmath12 .",
    "thus , in the case of @xmath13 , only two nucleons can melt . for values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 ,",
    "this minimum is 3 and 8 nucleons respectively .",
    "the aim was to keep the minimum @xmath10 leading to qgp production to be above 10 nucleons . in the process of simulation ,",
    "@xmath11 nucleons are taken aside and rest of the particles participates further in collision simulated with the venus code .",
    "the total energy of @xmath11 nucleons , denoted @xmath16 , is used to produce again @xmath11 nucleons , but this time with the kinetic energy generated according to the boltzmann distribution and isotropically in the overall centre of mass system .",
    "the remaining @xmath16 is used for production of @xmath17 and @xmath18 , again with boltzmann distributed kinetic energy and isotropically in the centre of mass system .",
    "the pion production is stopped when the @xmath16 is reduced to @xmath19 . afterwards this remnant cluster is passed to corsika for further processing . for each of the three values of @xmath20",
    "considered , the pions were generated with boltzmann distribution parameters corresponding to the mean pion momenta @xmath21 values of @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "the wide range of the values of the fraction , @xmath20 , together with a range of possible values of the mean momentum of generated pions are intended to account for uncertainties in the description of the qgp freeze out .",
    "the properties of eventual qgp formed in light nuclei interactions are also unknown .",
    "for example , the temperature might not be high enough to produce @xmath26 or even @xmath27 quark pairs .",
    "also the isotropy of pions radiated during the freeze out is not assured and the mean momentum along the shower axis may differ from momenta in the transverse plane . however , it turns out that the results are not sensitive to this .",
    "the results of simulations with @xmath28 and @xmath29 do not differ significantly from those with overall @xmath30 .",
    "hence , for the sake of simplicity , the pion production is considered to be isotropic .",
    "the mean number of all kinds of pions produced under different conditions in this simple approach are given in the table  [ tab : hotpions ] .",
    "the number of pions produced per nucleon - nucleon interaction and its dependence on the primary energy are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : npipernn ] . the two extreme cases - one with maximum pion production , i.e. 40 % of @xmath10 nucleons melting down and pions evaporating with mean momentum of @xmath31 ( henceforth we shall abbreviate this as @xmath32 ) , and the other with minimum pion production ( @xmath33 ) are shown .    .mean numbers of pions ( both @xmath17 and @xmath18 ) produced in qgp",
    ". figures given in the parentheses represent the r.m.s . values . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the underground muon size @xmath34 ( necessarily truncated by the design of experimental area ) reveals notable differences already in the case of unmodified models ( table  [ tab : ugsize ] ) .",
    "the value used to define the tail of the underground muon size distribution , 990 muons , has been chosen so that in the case of pure venus simulations 400 events pass the limit and the statistical error is only 5 % .",
    "the effects of qgp are clearly detectable when the fraction of melted nucleons becomes larger .",
    "the muon size at medium depth underground also shows differences between venus and qgsjet in the case of proton showers .",
    "the muon ldf obtained from venus have systematically higher values , both for iron nuclei and protons , than those generated by qgsjet ( fig .",
    "[ fig : uldfm ] ) . in all cases compared here , the statistical errors are smaller than the marker size .",
    "apparently such an underground experiment can essentially help to tune the models which is an indispensable condition for any further studies on chemical composition of cosmic rays and search for qgp effects in cosmic ray showers .",
    "the underground muon ldf with qgp simulation differs from the reference ldf obtained from data simulated by venus code only .",
    "[ fig : uldfrat ] a)-d ) show the underground muon lateral distribution functions corresponding to different values of the ratio @xmath20 divided by the reference ldf .",
    "each picture summarises the distributions with the same value of @xmath21 .",
    "the functions correspond to the events with large underground muon size - @xmath35 , where the differences were most notable .",
    "the ldf of venus and qgsjet with the same condition , @xmath35 , are mutually much less different than the ldf without any conditions in fig .",
    "[ fig : uldfm ] - within the statistical errors they practically coincide over the whole range @xmath36 .",
    "hence the effects caused by qgp production are in this sense model independent .",
    "[ fig : uldfrat ] a)-d ) show that the effects of more abundant pion production caused by increasing @xmath20 can be offset by increasing @xmath21 to a certain extent . near the centre of the shower , both scenarios give similar results .",
    "but at greater distances from the shower core the ldf with qgp contribution decreases slower than the reference one and starts to differ .",
    "this point of departure moves away from the shower centre with increasing @xmath21 and becomes more prominent with the increase of @xmath20 .",
    "as we are not dealing with real data it is not considered necessary to increase the statistics to pinpoint exactly the values of @xmath20 and @xmath21 at which the distinction between models with and without qgp can be made .",
    "the comparison of the ldf s shows that with increasing @xmath21 one has also to increase the distance upto which the ldf can be measured in order to be able to see possible qgp effects . at small",
    "@xmath20 one has to increase the observation time or the detection area to achieve the same result .",
    "thus the resolving power of the experiment is related to the dimensions of the detector available underground .",
    "assuming the detection area to be @xmath37 and 10 % iron nuclei and 90 % protons in the primary flux , one can get in @xmath38 ( 75 % of a year ) @xmath39 iron initiated events and 34 000 proton initiated events , with @xmath35 .",
    "these numbers correspond to showers initiated by particles with @xmath40 . in the case of @xmath41",
    "the overall flux is smaller and one would get only about 200 iron events and 400 proton events , assuming the same fraction for events above 990 muons cut as at @xmath40 .",
    "actually the percentage of events above this cut increases with energy and the yield of observed events should be higher .",
    "results obtained from simulations discussed above can not be compared at present with real data as the muon detectors are either located at ground level where the high energy component is entirely hidden in the overall muon flux or they are located so deep underground that the muon momentum cutoff is of the order of tev or larger and only few muons penetrate to the detector ( @xcite,@xcite,@xcite , @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the few experiments with medium overburden have either crude spatial resolution like the underwater experiments @xcite and @xcite or they have relatively small detection area like @xcite ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the present study is based on the assumption that the high energy interactions of cosmic rays in the atmosphere may lead to the production of qgp in the initial stage of the shower development .",
    "the inclusion of a very simple model of qgp production and freeze - out into high energy interactions of iron nuclei with air in cosmic ray showers has shown that under certain kinematical conditions one could observe the qgp induced effects in the high energy muon component of extensive air showers .",
    "these kinematical conditions are mainly the availability of sufficient energy @xmath16 of melted nucleons and not too high mean momentum @xmath21 of the evaporated pions .",
    "the model has been intentionally chosen so simple so that it can cover sufficiently large interval of these two quantities with minimum parameters .",
    "moreover the simulations have shown that the underground data on muons are rather insensitive to the isotropy of initial qgp pion distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : qgmpidec ] ) .",
    "it is interesting that none of the simulated qgp systems increases the muon density in the very centre of the shower and this number is essentially determined by the unmodified high energy interaction model ( venus in this case ) .",
    "even in the situation when there is no apparent difference in the underground muon size @xmath34 or underground ldf , like in the case of @xmath33 , the qgp production can still be detected provided there is an independent measurement of the shower energy , e.g. the muon size @xmath43 on the surface .",
    "this quantity is proportional to the energy of the incident nucleus and the proportionality holds even underground ( fig .",
    "[ fig : edefic ] ) .",
    "since the creation of qgp distorts the @xmath44 relation , a comparison of the muon sizes on the surface and underground may indicate deviation from the standard scenario .",
    "events under the diagonal of proportionality @xmath45 are what one would expect - as the abundant pion production in qgp mimics higher energy of the projectile nucleus .",
    "the events above the diagonal are more intriguing . in this case",
    "clearly the muons produced from qgp are not able to offset the loss which is due to several factors .",
    "one of them is that in normal interactions the leading particle effect constrains the lateral energy dissipation .",
    "no such effect has been included into qgp simulation and this combined with sometimes very high altitude of the primary interaction leads to the spraying of the qgp originated muons on a very large area .",
    "moreover the pions from qgp mostly do not start particle cascades and their energy is not converted into secondary particles any more .",
    "thus one can take roughly the muon multiplicity deficit in a standard interaction as @xmath46 while the gain in multiplicity from qgp is @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the detection efficiency factor which is quite small ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : qgmpidec ] ) , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are the slope parameters and @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the intercepts .",
    "the net result @xmath53 is apparently a linear function with positive intercept and negative slope . at smaller @xmath16",
    "while the intercept prevails one gets higher multiplicity than normal and when higher energy portion is lost from standard production one gets events with lower muon multiplicities underground .",
    "another factor contributing to the multiplicity deficit is the exemption of @xmath11 nucleons from further interactions - there are only @xmath54 nucleons with the energy @xmath55 .",
    "the baryons evaporated from qgp can not provide enough muons to balance the loss of forward production initiated by @xmath11 nucleons in standard interaction .",
    "this part of the deficit is quite difficult to express quantitatively in terms of linear relations",
    ". otherwise it would be much easier to measure chemical composition of cosmic rays !",
    "in fact , events with lower muon multiplicity underground could be mistaken as products of interactions of lighter primary nuclei .",
    "therefore , the resolution in energy measurement both at surface and underground will be crucial to make the distinction .",
    "the measurements on energetic muons in cosmic ray showers at medium depth underground can reveal information on the initial stages of interactions which are otherwise inaccessible through measurements on the surface . provided the qgp is formed in interactions of lighter nuclei , the number of produced muons will grow linearly with c.m.s .",
    "energy per nucleon .",
    "the ratio @xmath20 should , in naive expectation , also grow with the energy .",
    "hence the observable effects are likely to become more apparent at higher energies ( in the simple model used here , @xmath20 was considered to be energy independent ) .",
    "thus , in principle , one should be able to study some of the scenarios of qgp deflagration or detonation at the freeze out described in @xcite .",

    "i am very grateful to jiri masik for his continuing and patient help in solving all problems connected with computing .",
