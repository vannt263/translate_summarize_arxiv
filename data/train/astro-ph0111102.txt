    "the s235 star - forming region includes small optical nebulosities ( s235a , s235b , and s235c ) , and it is located about 10@xmath1 south of s235 , which is a well known hii region .",
    "this star - forming region has been identified by @xmath2 maser ( lo et al .",
    "1975 , genzel & downes 1977 ) , infrared emission ( krassner et al . 1997 , evans et al .",
    "1981 , felli et al.1997 ) , radio continuum ( krassner et al . 1979 ,",
    "felli et al .",
    "1997 ) , and molecular line spectra ( evans et al . 1981 , makoto et al .",
    "1986 , snell et al .",
    "1990 , felli et al .",
    "according to previous results , the region has several components with somewhat different spatial distributions .",
    "we present the initial findings of a major observing campaign aimed at understanding the complexity of s235 with greater lucidity .",
    "we observed the dust emission from s235 at 350 @xmath0 with the submillimeter high angular resolution camera ( sharc ) at the cso during december 1997 and show the resulting map , with a resolution of about 11 , in figure 1 .",
    "there are two dust cores ; the northern one is close to and , presumably , related to the compact hii region , s235a , and the infrared source , irs3 .",
    "krassner et al . (",
    "1979 ) found two 2.2 @xmath0 point source in s235a , and felli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) observed molecular hydrogen emission distributed around the hii region .",
    "this @xmath3 emission is along the southeast edge of our northern dust core .",
    "several infrared point sources observed at 2.2@xmath0 ( felli et al .",
    "1997 ) are located between the two dust cores . on the other hand ,",
    "the southern dust core is not associated with any optical nebula , hii region , or nir point source to heat it . s235b and irs4 ,",
    "the nearest signposts of activity , are about 0.3 pc away from the peak of this core .",
    "therefore , we suggest that this is a less evolved star - forming core .",
    "we observed over 50 transitions of 23 molecules ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 ) at the cso from 1998 to 2000 .",
    "the typical line width of these molecular spectra is about 3kms@xmath27 at the peak for the northern molecular core .",
    "the cs @xmath28 integrated intensity map ( figure 1 ) clearly resolves two molecular cores , of which the southern core is less pronounced .",
    "the two dust cores , however , are not resolved due to poorer angular resolution ( 25 ) , but we do see a slight extension of the northern molecular core in the direction of the southern dust core .",
    "further molecular line observations with better angular resolution are needed to study gas components associated with the two dust components ."
