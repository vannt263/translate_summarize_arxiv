    "inflationary models are designed to produce a universe which is sufficiently homogeneous on all observable scales @xcite . however ,",
    "on much larger scales the universe is expected to be extremely inhomogeneous .",
    "the evolution of the field @xmath0 , whose vacuum energy drives inflation , is influenced by quantum fluctuations .",
    "these fluctuations can be pictured as a random walk of @xmath0 superimposed on its slow roll down the slope of its potential . as a result ,",
    "thermalization of the vacuum energy does not occur simultaneously everywhere in the universe , and at any time there are parts of the universe that are still inflating @xcite .    on very large scales ,",
    "the universe is expected to consist of isolated thermalized regions embedded in the inflating background .",
    "the boundaries of the thermalized regions expand into this background , and new regions are constantly being formed , but the high expansion rate of the intervening inflating domains prevents these regions from filling up the universe .",
    "thermalization inevitably occurs at any given co - moving location , and the co - moving volume of the inflating regions decreases exponentially with time . at the same time , the physical volume of these regions is exponentially growing .",
    "the geometry of the inflating regions is that of a self - similar fractal of dimension @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "it is illustrated in fig.1 for the case of `` open''inflation , where the false vacuum decay occurs through bubble nucleation @xcite .",
    "for `` new '' or `` chaotic '' inflation the picture would be similar , except the thermalized regions would have irregular shapes .    in the present paper we are going to argue that this picture of the superlarge - scale structure of the universe can be significantly modified by quantum fluctuations that bring localized parts of already thermalized regions , such as our observable universe , back to the inflating false - vacuum state .",
    "the modification is particularly important in models where the post - thermalization true vacuum is characterized by a positive vacuum energy ( cosmological constant ) . in this case",
    "the thermalized regions asymptotically approach de sitter geometry , and the rate of fluctuations back to the false vacuum ( per unit spacetime volume ) approaches a constant .",
    "even with an exceedingly small rate , the probability for true vacuum to survive at any co - moving location is exponentially decreasing with time .",
    "hence , ( almost ) all the co - moving volume of thermalized regions will eventually be recycled back to the inflationary phase .",
    "each nucleated false vacuum region will serve as a seed for a new eternally inflating domain , whose internal structure will resemble that shown in fig.1 .",
    "the thermalized regions formed in this domain will in turn produce new false vacuum seeds , _ etc_. we call this kind of model a recycling universe .",
    "quantum nucleation of regions with a higher energy density can not occur from a flat - spacetime vacuum characterized by a vanishing cosmological constant : such processes are forbidden by energy conservation .",
    "however , upward fluctuations of this kind can occur in an expanding cosmological background , and have been previously discussed by a number of authors @xcite .",
    "the most relevant for our purposes here is the paper by lee and weinberg @xcite who considered a model of a scalar field @xmath0 with a potential @xmath2 shown in fig.2 .",
    "note that both false and true vacua have positive energy densities , @xmath3 .",
    "it has been known for some time that the high - energy false vacuum at @xmath4 can decay by nucleation of true vacuum bubbles .",
    "the corresponding instanton ( `` bounce '' ) has been found by coleman and de luccia @xcite .",
    "the bubble nucleation rate is given by @xmath5 , \\label{bouncet}\\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the bounce action and @xmath7 is the action of the euclideanized false - vacuum de sitter space ( we use planck units throughout the paper ) .",
    "lee and weinberg conjectured that the same instanton also describes the inverse process of true vacuum decay , where false vacuum bubbles nucleate in a true vacuum background .",
    "the nucleation rate suggested by eq.([bouncet ] ) is @xmath8 \\label{bouncef}\\ ] ] with @xmath9 .",
    "lee and weinberg argued that the pre - exponential factors in eqs .",
    "( [ bouncet ] ) and ( [ bouncef ] ) are the same .",
    "these conjectures were later verified @xcite in the case of @xmath10-dimensional universes , where bubble nucleation can be identified with the production of particle - antiparticle pairs .",
    "note that the rate ( [ bouncef ] ) vanishes if the true vacuum has zero energy .",
    "as it stands , the potential in fig.2 is not suitable for inflationary cosmology .",
    "this potential has no slow - roll region , so most of the vacuum energy remains in domain walls and never gets thermalized .",
    "we shall see , however , that models incorporating both realistic inflation and true vacuum decay can be constructed by a trivial modification of `` open '' inflationary models .",
    "moreover , we shall argue that nucleation of inflating regions is possible even with the simplest slow - roll potentials , for which the coleman - de luccia instanton does not exist .",
    "the recycling nature of inflationary universe may have important implications for the question of whether or not the universe had a beginning in time .",
    "as we already mentioned , inflation is generically eternal to the future , so it is natural to ask if the inflationary models can be continued into the infinite past , resulting in a `` steady - state '' non - singular cosmology .",
    "this possibility was discussed in the early 80 s , soon after the inflationary scenario was proposed , with the conclusion that the idea could not be implemented in the simplest model in which the inflating universe is described by an exact de sitter space @xcite .",
    "a more general proof of impossibility of steady state inflation was given in refs .",
    "@xcite , but we shall see later in this paper that some of the assumptions made in the proof do not apply in the case of a recycling universe .",
    "the question of the necessity of the beginning is therefore re - opened .",
    "recycling may also be relevant to the question of making predictions in an inflationary universe .",
    "recently , there have been a number of attempts @xcite to find probability distributions for cosmological parameters such as the effective cosmological constant @xmath11 or the density parameter @xmath12 .",
    "these `` predictions '' are based on the principle of mediocrity @xcite , by which we are most likely to live in the most abundant type of civilization that can result from the thermalization of a fase vacuum .",
    "however , in the inflationary universe , there will be an infinite number of infinite thermalized regions , and one faces the difficulty of comparing infinities @xcite .",
    "regularization procedures were introduced in @xcite to deal with this problem , but these can not be directly applied to a recycling universe .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we shall give some examples of inflationary models which allow nucleation of false vacuum bubbles .",
    "the geometry of the nucleated bubbles will be analyzed in section 3 . in section 4",
    "we shall discuss the implications of the recycling universe model for the question of the beginning of the universe .",
    "the superlarge - scale structure of a recycling universe will be studied in section 5 using the methods of stochastic inflation .",
    "the issue of predictions will be discussed in section 6 , and our conclusions will be summarized in section 7 .",
    "in all realistic inflationary models , the potential of the inflaton field @xmath0 is required to have a sufficiently flat slow - roll region in which @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the expansion rate and @xmath15 is the horizon size corresponding to the vacuum energy @xmath2 , @xmath16 on the other hand , coleman - de luccia - type solutions for vacuum bubbles exist only when the potential is sufficiently curved near the barrier separating true and false vacua @xcite , @xmath17 the meaning of this condition is easy to understand .",
    "the bubble wall thickness is @xmath18 ) is valid everywhere in the inflationary range of @xmath0 .",
    "a similar problem arises in the `` open '' inflation scenario , where false vacuum decay through bubble nucleation is followed by a period of slow roll in bubble interiors @xcite .",
    "one way to deal with this problem is to consider a two - field model , with one field doing the tunneling and the other doing the slow roll @xcite .",
    "the potential can be chosen as @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the tunneling field and the potential @xmath21 has the form as in fig.2 with a metastable minimum at @xmath22 and a true minimum at @xmath23 .",
    "the full potential @xmath24 is independent of @xmath0 ( has a flat direction ) at @xmath22 , and as a result the expansion rate in the false vacuum is also independent of @xmath0 .",
    "the potential @xmath25 is assumed to have a slow - roll range and a minimum at @xmath26 with @xmath27 , at which thermalization eventually occurs . in a variant of this model @xcite",
    ", the two fields can be taken to represent the radial and angular parts of a single complex field , @xmath28 .",
    "the stage for open inflation is set by inflating false vacuum with energy density @xmath29 .",
    "nucleating bubbles expand into this background , but because of the high expansion rate of the intervening false vacuum regions , bubble collisions are rare .",
    "the interior geometry of each bubble is that of an open robertson - walker universe .",
    "the bubbles have different initial values of @xmath0 , and if this value falls in the slow - roll range of the potential , then there is a period of inflation inside the corresponding bubble .",
    "inflation is followed by thermalization and standard cosmological evolution , but since we assumed a non - zero cosmological constant , the bubble interiors are eventually dominated by the true vacuum energy , @xmath30 .",
    "false vacuum bubbles will now be formed in the true vacuum background , resulting in the endless succession of stages of the recycling universe .",
    "it should be noted that tunneling back to the false vacuum can occur not only from the true vacuum @xmath31 , but also from the slow - roll , as well as radiation and matter - dominated periods .",
    "in fact , the rate of false vacuum bubble nucleation is expected to be the highest during the slow - roll inflation [ due to the higher energy density at that time , see eq.([bouncef ] ) ] . however , since all these periods last only for a finite time , and the rate of false vacuum bubble formation is extremely low , only a tiny fraction of the co - moving volume will be affected by such processes . on the other hand ,",
    "the true - vacuum - dominated stage persists indefinitely , and practically all the co - moving volume will be recycled by bubbles nucleating in the true vacuum .",
    "an alternative to the two - field model ( [ lm ] ) is a model of a single scalar field @xmath0 with a potential of the form shown in fig.3 @xcite .",
    "the false vacuum at @xmath4 is separated from the slow - roll region by a sharp barrier .",
    "( the coexistence of flat and highly curved regions in the same potential is a somewhat unnatural feature of this model ) .",
    "the field @xmath0 tunnels through the barrier and after a period of slow roll , ends up in the true vacuum , which we assume to have a non - zero energy density , @xmath32 .",
    "an important difference of this model from that of eq.([lm ] ) is that now , in order to tunnel from true to false vacuum , the field @xmath0 has to go across the whole slow - roll region .",
    "false vacuum bubbles will therefore consist of a false vacuum core surrounded by a domain wall , which is in turn surrounded by layers of slow roll , radiation , and matter - dominated regions ( see fig.4 ) .",
    "intuitively , we would expect that the nucleation of such a complicated structure should be extremely unlikely , and thus the nucleation rate of false vacuum bubbles in this one - field model should be strongly suppressed compared to the two - field model ( [ lm ] ) .",
    "however , according to eq.([bouncef ] ) this would not be so .",
    "the bounce solution depends only on the form of the potential @xmath2 in the vicinity of the barrier .",
    "thus the tunneling rate given by the expression ( [ bouncef ] ) is essentially independent of what happens in the slow - roll region and would not be much different if that region was absent .",
    "it should be remembered though that the use of euclidean methods in de sitter space has never been justified from first principles , and therefore the results obtained using these methods should be taken with caution @xcite .",
    "this issue needs further investigation , but we will not attempt to address it in the present paper",
    ". the specific value of false vacuum bubble nucleation rate will not be important for our conclusions , as long as this rate is non - zero .",
    "if the barrier in the inflaton potential is too wide to satisfy the condition ( [ cond ] ) , then the coleman - de luccia instanton does not exist .",
    "however , there is always a homogeneous hawking - moss instanton @xcite in which @xmath0 takes the value @xmath33 corresponding to the top of the barrier . this instanton is usually interpreted as describing quantum tunneling from false vacuum to the top of the barrier in a horizon - size region .",
    "( coleman - de luccia instanton reduces to that of hawking and moss as the barrier width is increased ) . in the spirit of lee and weinberg @xcite",
    ", we can interpret the same instanton as describing tunneling from true vacuum to the top of the barrier .",
    "the corresponding nucleation rate is @xmath34 , \\label{bouncehm}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 .    in models of `` new '' inflation , the generic potential",
    "is illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "there is no barrier in this case , but still there is a hawking - moss instanton with @xmath33 corresponding to the maximum of the potential .",
    "there are also approximate homogeneous instanton solutions with @xmath0 sufficiently close to the maximum . such approximate instantons also exist in models of `` chaotic '' inflation where the potential may have no maxima . a constant field @xmath0 is a good approximation as long as the evolution of @xmath0 is slow on the hubble scale @xmath15 , that is , in the slow roll range .",
    "the euclidean expression for the tunneling rate from true vacuum to @xmath0 in this range is given by eq.([bouncehm ] ) with @xmath37 .",
    "once again , we find the formula ( [ bouncehm ] ) somewhat suspicious , and emphasize the need for a derivation of the nucleation rate without relying on euclidean methods .",
    "linde @xcite has given an estimate of the probability of tunneling to false vacuum on rather general grounds . in de sitter space , a field @xmath0 fluctuates on scales bigger or comparable to the hubble radius around a local minimum @xmath38 of the potential with amplitude given by @xcite @xmath39 strictly speaking , the result is only true for a free field and for small fluctuations , so that the mass @xmath40 and the expansion rate @xmath14 are well defined .",
    "extrapolating to the case of an interacting field and ignoring the gravitational backreaction of the fluctuations on the expansion rate , the probability that a region of size @xmath41 will tunnel from @xmath38 to a different value @xmath0 sufficiently close to the maximum of @xmath2 can be estimated as @xmath42.\\ ] ] for the case of a quadratic potential with @xmath43 and @xmath44 , the exponent in the previous expression reproduces the exponent @xmath45 $ ] which appears in eqn .",
    "( [ bouncehm ] ) , with @xmath37 @xcite .    in any case",
    ", we expect the rate to be non - zero in the general case .",
    "the reason is simply that the nucleation is not forbidden by any conservation laws , and thus should have a non - zero probability .",
    "to study the geometry of false vacuum bubbles , we shall first assume that the bubble wall thickness is much smaller than all other relevant dimensions of the problem .",
    "the wall can then be treated as infinitely thin , and the spacetime regions on the two sides of the wall are de sitter spaces of different vacuum energy .",
    "we now briefly review some properties of de sitter space .",
    "it is well known that de sitter space can be pictured as a hyperboloid embedded in a flat 5-dimensional spacetime , @xmath46 where @xmath47 is a 3-vector .",
    "a section of the hyperboloid by the @xmath48-plane is shown in fig.6 .",
    "the euclideanized de sitter space , which is used for constructing instantons , is obtained by analytic continuation @xmath49 , @xmath50 geometrically , this is a 4-sphere of radius @xmath15 .",
    "let @xmath60 and @xmath61 be de sitter horizons corresponding respectively to the false and true vacuum energy densities , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "clearly , @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "the thin wall approximation requires that the wall thickness be much smaller than @xmath60 . in this case",
    ", the coleman - de luccia instanton for bubble nucleation can be obtained by matching two 4-spheres of radii @xmath60 and @xmath61 ( see fig.7 ) .",
    "the two spheres are joint at a 3-sphere which represents the euclideanized worldsheet of the domain wall . its radius @xmath66 is determined by @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and the wall tension @xmath67 @xcite .",
    "the 5-dimensional coordinates can always be chosen so that this worldsheet lies in a plane of constant @xmath68 . in the figure it is @xmath69 , where @xmath70 the lorentzian evolution of the bubble is given by two hyperboloids",
    "similarly matched along a constant-@xmath68 plane ( fig.8 ) .",
    "descriptions of both true and false vacuum bubbles can be obtained with an appropriate slicing of this spacetime by equal - time surfaces .    in the case of false vacuum bubbles ,",
    "equal - time surfaces can be chosen to be the surfaces @xmath71 ( fig.8 ) .",
    "then , each constant-@xmath56 slice consists of a spherical region of false vacuum embedded in an infinite , spatially - flat region of true vacuum . since the spatial geometry of these slices is flat both inside and outside the bubble , the volume that is removed from true vacuum by the appearance of the bubble is equal to the volume of false vacuum which replaces it ( this would not be the case if we used closed spatial sections , for instance ) .",
    "we can use the coordinates ( [ desitter ] ) with @xmath72 to describe the exterior true - vacuum region .",
    "the wall worldsheet is at @xmath69 , and from eq.([hyp - ds ] ) the radius of the bubble at time @xmath56 is @xmath73 where @xmath74 .",
    "we see that the radius approaches the horizon size @xmath61 at @xmath75 .",
    "the bubble wall accelerates in the direction of the false vacuum , so that its co - moving radius @xmath76 is contracting , but the physical radius grows exponentially due to the expansion of the universe . a conformal diagram for the bubble spacetime",
    "is shown in fig.9 .",
    "since @xmath77 is a monotonically growing function of time , there is no `` bounce '' moment at which one can say that the nucleation occurs .",
    "the situation here is similar to that for nucleation of topological defects in de sitter space @xcite , and as in the latter case , we shall regard the bubble ( [ rf ] ) as `` formed '' at @xmath78 , when its radius begins to grow exponentially .    for the trajectory given in eqn .",
    "( [ rf ] ) , the region of true vacuum which has been removed and replaced by true vacuum was centered at the point @xmath79 ( see figs . 6 and 8) .",
    "we shall refer to this point as the center of symmetry of the bubble trajectory .",
    "( notice that this point may not belong to the actual classical spacetime , because it is precisely in the region where bubble nucleation takes place , but it does belong to the five - dimensional embedding space . ) performing lorentz transformations in the embedding space , we can obtain bubbles whose center of symmetry is at any time @xmath80 and at any location .",

    "our main interest in this paper is in models with @xmath94 . in such models ,",
    "the radius of false vacuum bubbles is @xmath95 , and thus the thin wall approximation can be used to describe the bubble evolution even when the wall thickness is @xmath96 .",
    "( note however that in this case the thin wall approximation breaks down for the instanton itself and for the early evolution of true vacuum bubbles ) .    in a single - field model of open inflation , with a potential as in fig .",
    "3 , the conformal diagram for a false vacuum bubble is shown in fig.10 .    so far in this section we assumed that the true vacuum has a positive energy density . if the vacuum energy is in fact zero , then the horizon radius in thermalized regions keeps growing with time , and false vacuum bubbles eventually come within the horizon .",
    "the bubbles are then seen as black holes from the outside .",
    "the bubble nucleation in this case is similar to the quantum creation of baby universes , as discussed in refs .",
    "black holes eventually evaporate and baby universes pinch off .",
    "assuming that some rather general conditions are met , it was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that inflationary models can not be geodesically complete to the past , that is , they require some sort of a beginning .",
    "the assumptions that lead to this result are the following .",
    "a. the universe is causally simple @xcite .",
    "b. the universe is open .    c. the null convergence condition @xcite .",
    "d. the finite past - volume difference condition .    the first two of these assumptions do not appear to be crucial for the proof , and extensions of the theorem",
    "have been obtained to some closed universes @xcite and to some universes with a more complicated causal structure @xcite .",
    "the null convergence condition is closely related to the weak energy condition , which requires that the energy density is non - negative when measured by any observer .",
    "classically , this is satisfied by all known forms of matter , including a relativistic scalar field , but violations of the null convergence condition are possible as a result of quantum fluctuations .",
    "such violations tend to occur in the inflating regions of spacetime whenever quantum fluctuations result in a local increase of the expansion rate , @xmath97 @xcite",
    ". they are sufficient to invalidate the theorem in models characterized by a substantial variation of @xmath2 in the range of @xmath0 where quantum fluctuations are non - negligible .",
    "this includes all models of `` chaotic '' inflation , but not some open and `` new '' inflationary models .",
    "turning now to the effects of recycling , we shall argue that they invalidate both assumptions c and d , so that the theorem as it stands does not apply to any inflationary model . in the case of assumption c ,",
    "the reason is the same as before : quantum fluctuations from thermalized regions back to the inflating phase increase the expansion rate in the affected regions of space , and the null convergence condition is violated .",
    "the finite past - volume difference condition ( @xmath98 ) can be formulated as follows .",
    "given a point @xmath99 in the inflating region and a point @xmath100 to the past of @xmath99 , consider the difference of their pasts .",
    "this is a spacetime region including all points to the past of @xmath99 , but not of @xmath100 .",
    "the condition @xmath98 requires that the spacetime volume of this region should be finite .",
    "the original motivation for this condition was based on the picture of eternally inflating universe without recycling , as illustrated in fig.1 .",
    "it can be shown that thermalization surfaces , which separate inflating and thermalized regions of spacetime , are spacelike surfaces @xcite . therefore ,",
    "if @xmath100 is a point in an inflating region , then , disregarding recycling , all points in its past must also lie in the inflating region . for inflation to persist from @xmath100 to @xmath99 ,",
    "no thermalized regions should be formed in the difference of the pasts of the two points .",
    "now , it seems plausible that there is a zero probability for no thermalized regions to form in an infinite spacetime volume .",
    "then it follows that condition @xmath98 is necessary for inflation to persist in the future time direction .",
    "this condition is difficult to satisfy , since the spacetime region representing the difference of the pasts of the two points has an infinite extent along the past - directed null geodesics .    in a recycling universe",
    ", this logic does not apply , since points in inflating regions can have thermalized regions in their past . in this case",
    ", the spacetime region relevant for persistence of inflation between a pair of points is not the entire difference of their pasts , but only the part of this difference which lies in the same inflating region as the two points . in other words",
    ", it is the part of the difference of the pasts which is to the future of the `` nucleation surface '' ( see fig.9 ) .",
    "the volume of this region is obviously finite .",
    "hence , assumption @xmath98 is not suitable for a recycling universe .    in models with a vanishing true vacuum energy , only a small fraction of thermalized volume",
    "gets recycled .",
    "however , there still appears to be a possibility that the universe has a nested structure , with all inflating regions originating as quantum fluctuations inside thermalized regions .",
    "we thus conclude that the theorems of refs . @xcite",
    "no longer apply when the recycling nature of the universe is taken into account .",
    "this may open the door for constructing non - singular , steady - state inflationary models .",
    "we emphasize , however , that our analysis does not imply that such models do in fact exist .",
    "it has been argued in refs .",
    "@xcite that inflation , when continued to the past , is necessarily preceeded by a period of contraction , as in the exact de sitter space . during this period",
    ", the thermalized regions would merge , the density perturbations would grow very fast , and the universe would rapidly reach a grossly inhomogeneous state from which it is not likely to recover .",
    "the arguments in @xcite do not rely on weak energy or finite past - volume difference conditions , and may possibly be extended to the case of a recycling universe .",
    "these arguments , although suggestive , fall short of a proof , and the problem requires further investigation .",
    "a quantitative description of the recycling universe can be given using the formalism of stochastic inflation developed in refs .",
    "@xcite . a straightforward extension of this formalism will be required , and to introduce the necessary modifications , we shall first consider the lee - weinberg model @xcite with a potential as in fig.2 .",

    "the bubbles take time @xmath113 to traverse this distance , but in the stochastic inflation formalism we shall be interested in quantities smeared over a spacetime scale @xmath41 , so we shall disregard this time delay and write @xmath114 where @xmath115 is the rate of bubble nucleation per unit spacetime volume .    in an expanding universe , however , the rate of nucleation per unit spacetime volume has to be defined with some care .",
    "this is because this rate depends on what we choose as the nucleation time , which is not always sharply defined ( especially when the size of bubbles becomes comparable to the hubble radius . ) for instance , we can change our definition of nucleation time from @xmath116 to @xmath93 , where @xmath116 is defined by eqn ( [ rttn ] ) as the time at which the physical radius of the bubble reaches its minimum value @xmath66 , and @xmath93 is defined as the center of symmetry of the bubble wall trajectory as seen from the outside ( as explained in sect .",
    "iii ) . in changing the definition of nucleation time ,",

    "we have to conclude that , despite some effort , none of the approaches suggested so far appears to be particularly compelling .",
    "it may turn out that , after all , an eternally inflating universe does not admit a uniquely defined probability distribution for the constants of nature .",
    "if so , this does not necessarily mean that all possible sets of constants consistent with our existence are equally likely .",
    "although the ratio @xmath312 may depend on the choice of cutoff procedure , it is conceivable that in some cases @xmath313 for all reasonable choices .",
    "we would then `` predict '' that @xmath314 is much more likely than @xmath315 .",
    "it is possible that we will have to restrict ourselves to such `` stable '' predictions , which are insensitive to the choice of cutoff @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the picture of the superlarge - scale structure of the inflationary universe is significantly modified by quantum fluctuations which bring parts of already thermalized regions back to the false vacuum , a process which we call recycling .",
    "in particular , the question of whether or not the universe had a beginning is reopened . ignoring recycling , and under certain rather general conditions",
    ", it has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite that inflationary models require a beginning in time . in the recycling picture , this conclusion does not apply because it is only necessary that any false vacuum region has a beginning in time .",
    "one can therefore imagine a nested structure where all false vacuum regions are just bubbles which nucleated inside preexisting true vacuum bubbles , which in turn nucleated inside false vacuum bubbles and so on . whether or not this pattern can be continued to the infinite past is an interesting open question .",
    "we have extended the standard formalism of stochastic inflation @xcite to study the probability distribution of phases in which co - moving observers ( or co - moving volume ) find themselves in the recycling universe . instead of the fokker - planck equation ,",
    "one now has a more general master equation .",
    "we found that , in the case of complete recycling , all solutions of this equation rapidly approach a stationary form .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard case , where the probability disribution decreases exponentially with time , due to the loss of co - moving volume at thermalization .    in the absence of recycling ,",
    "the fractal dimension of the false vacuum co - moving volume at large times is lower than three . including recycling , this dimension is @xmath237 because co - moving volume in false vacuum is continually replenished by nucleating false vacuum bubbles .",
    "the universe ends up in a highly convoluted state , where the fractal dimension of any connected false or true vacuum region is lower than three .",
    "finally , we have considered the question of `` making predictions '' for the constants of nature in the context of a recycling universe .",
    "the principle of mediocrity has been invoked in the past in order to obtain probability distributions for the constants . for the case of finite inflation",
    "the procedure is unambiguous : the probability is proportional to the number of civilizations that observed a given set of constants in the entire history of the universe . in the case of eternal inflation ,",
    "the principle is not so easy to implement , because the number of thermalized regions with given values of the constants is infinite ( even in a finite co - moving region ) , and one has to introduce a regulator . if one simply counts all civilizations below some cut - off time , then the result depends strongly on the choice of time variable @xcite .",
    "a gauge invariant cut - off prescription ( i.e. one which does not depend on the time variable ) was introduced in @xcite , but this prescription is not unique @xcite . to make matters more complicated ,",
    "the methods discussed so far can not be directly applied to a recycling universe .",
    "we have considered some generalizations and alternative approaches , but none of them is particularly compelling .",
    "therefore , it seems that while the principle of mediocrity may offer some valid guidance , it may not be sufficient to unambiguously determine the probability distribution for the constants of nature .",
    "if this turns out to be the final answer , then `` predictions '' would only be possible in those cases when all reasonable cut - off methods or implementations of the principle yield a similar answer .",
