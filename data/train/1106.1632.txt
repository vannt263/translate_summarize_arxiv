    "this paper describes spectral methods designed with a specific application in mind : numerical solution of a mixed - type problem arising in gravitational physics . in reviewing an ongoing program to construct helically symmetric solutions to the einstein equations",
    ", this introduction recalls the origins of this problem below .",
    "however , this paper also serves another purpose ; it demonstrates that spectral - tau _ integration preconditioning _ yields highly accurate numerical solutions to the helically reduced wave equation ( hrwe ) , a mixed - type , variable coefficient , linear partial differential equation ( pde ) problem , here posed on a nontrivial three - dimensional ( 3d ) domain . ref .",
    "@xcite offered spectral - tau integration preconditioning as a general - purpose strategy for spectral approximation of differential equations , and that reference provides the most thorough description and analysis of the technique ; related techniques were explored in @xcite ( integration postconditioning ) and @xcite ( nodal integration preconditioning ) , with applications described in , for example , refs .  @xcite .",
    "however , heretofore , spectral - tau integration preconditioning has primarily been studied either in the ode context or for pde problems posed on single and basic two - dimensional ( 2d ) domains ( rectangles , annuli , and disks ) , although we have earlier studied a 2d multidomain scenario @xcite as a warm - up to this work . while the current paper only considers the hrwe , a challenging model problem for the aforementioned target application , it shows how to implement the technique in a 3d multidomain setting , addressing several key conditioning issues which would seem to generically arise in higher dimensional settings .",
    "therefore , our work should facilitate the use of spectral - tau integration preconditioning for other elliptic or mixed - type pde problems .",
    "we provide more context and a fuller description of these issues below , but now turn to the physical problem which has motivated our work .",
    "the advent of gravitational wave detection has driven theoretical studies of gravitational wave sources .",
    "a source that is possibly interesting for ground - based detectors , and perhaps the most exciting source for space - based detectors , is the inspiral of two comparable mass black holes and their merger to form a single black hole .",
    "the early stage of inspiral is modeled with reasonable accuracy by perturbations of the newtonian analysis , and the post - merger stage can be analyzed with black hole perturbation theory .",
    "the most difficult stage to analyze is the intermediate stage , when a few orbits remain .",
    "this epoch of inspiral is too late for a modified newtonian approach , but too early for black hole perturbation theory . yet",
    "this is the epoch in which a large part of the gravitational wave energy is generated .",
    "the importance of , and difficulty in , analyzing this epoch was the original motivation for an innovative approximation , the periodic standing wave ( psw ) method .",
    "this approach uses the fully nonlinear field interactions , but models the binary compact objects to be forever on circular orbits of constant radius .",
    "therefore , both the compact source motions and the fields exhibit helical symmetry .",
    "not only does this symmetry reduce the number of independent variables , it also completely changes the nature of the governing pdes , turning the problem from the hyperbolic evolution of initial data to one of mixed - type that is elliptic near a rotation axis and hyperbolic well outside the axis and beyond the orbits in the wave zone of the system .",
    "more details of this astrophysical background are given in @xcite .",
    "here we only point out that recent supercomputer evolutions of initial black hole binary data have been run stably for many orbits in the intermediate epoch .",
    "see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ( not an exhaustive list ) , and @xcite for a recent review .",
    "even the inspiral of binaries with large mass ratios @xcite or high spins @xcite , both particularly challenging cases , can now be computed . to be sure ,",
    "recent successes with purely hyperbolic numerical evolutions have undercut the original motivation for the psw approximation .",
    "nevertheless , there remains a niche for the psw approximation for the following reasons .",
    "first , it should provide a test bench for understanding nonlinear gravitational radiation reaction as a local process .",
    "second , a helically symmetric solution of the einstein equations would be , of its own accord , of bewitching interest .",
    "the numerical computation of psw fields has , in fact , already been carried out , using a single grid and a unique method devised especially for the problem by one of us ( rhp ) and coworkers .",
    "these computations were done in a series of steps @xcite moving from linearized scalar fields up to and including the nonlinear tensor fields of general relativistic gravity . however , the method used proved inherently too limited in accuracy to be useful . furthermore , despite the attractive simplicity of the computational method , its implementation for general relativistic tensor fields proved very challenging . the astrophysical psw problem , therefore , can be viewed as not yet solved . the spectral methods described here",
    "are designed to solve this astrophysical problem to high accuracy . in any case , as mentioned above , our work is relevant as a successful use of spectral - tau integration preconditioning for the solution of pdes ( even of mixed - type ) on nontrivial 3d domains . from this standpoint , the astrophysical problem simply provides a convenient application , with a particularly interesting feature . in the astrophysical problem , the region in which the pdes are hyperbolic the distant wave zone is a region in which the pdes have only very small nonlinearities .",
    "the strong linearities , near the source objects , are confined to a region in which the pdes are elliptic . while we do not consider nonlinearities in the current paper , the methods we introduce for our linear model problem deliver sufficient accuracy that nonlinearities can almost surely be included .",
    "multidomain spectral methods for the binary inspiral of compact relativistic objects are not new . in pioneering work , nodal ( i.e.  collocation ) methods",
    "were used by pfeiffer _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite for the elliptical problem of constructing binary black hole initial data , and are now being used by the caltech - cornell - cita collaboration ( see , for example , @xcite ) in the fundamentally hyperbolic evolution problem .",
    "this work , now highly developed , relies on spec ( the spectral einstein code @xcite ) , a large c++ project chiefly developed by pfeiffer , kidder , and scheel , but also involving many other researchers and developers .",
    "one certainly might attack the problem we consider with that software ; in particular with spec s ellipticmodule which uses finite - difference preconditioning @xcite and is also already configured to solve nonlinear problems .",
    "indeed , the ellipticmodule has been used to solve the initial value constraint equations on essentially the same type of domain we consider below , and we suspect that spec could be used to solve our problem to high accuracy . in any case , to date the 3d mixed problem considered here has not been numerically solved via spectral methods .",
    "our previous study @xcite applied a modal multidomain spectral - tau method to a model nonlinear problem of two strong field sources in binary motion with only two spatial dimensions .",
    "that study also relied on integration preconditioning , although the relevant linear systems were inverted by direct rather than iterative methods ( which was possible since the 2d problem was less memory intensive ) .",
    "our 2d study , a proof of concept , showed that high accuracy could be achieved with relatively modest memory and run - time requirements . here",
    "we generalize our 2d method to 3d , that is to three spatial dimensions and one time dimension , reduced to a problem with three independent variables by the imposition of helical symmetry . due to",
    "the larger set of modes needed for the 3d problem , iterative solution of the relevant linear system is now necessary .",
    "we use the generalized minimum residual method ( gmres ) @xcite .",
    "since the amount of work and storage per iteration increases with the iteration count @xcite , preconditioning is a crucial issue ( and here we mean further , one might even say _ genuine _ , preconditioning on top of the  integration preconditioning \" ) . through a multilevel preconditioning scheme",
    ", we will achieve near round - off accuracy for large truncations ( @xmath0 600,000 unknowns ) with modest iteration counts .",
    "moreover , as we achieve a sparse formulation of the relevant linear system , each iteration is also fast .      before writing down our mixed - type pde problem",
    ", we describe the two - center ( hereafter 2-center ) domain @xmath1 on which the problem is posed , first recalling the coordinate conventions of @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2 represent the inertial cartesian system related to the spherical - polar system @xmath3 in the usual physicist s convention ( @xmath4 and @xmath5 are respectively the polar and azimuthal angles ) .",
    "we then introduce a  comoving \" cartesian system @xmath6 where @xmath7 is a fixed rotation rate .",
    "note that the @xmath8 and @xmath9-axes coincide , and both are the azimuthal axis . via a simple permutation",
    ", we then define a new comoving system @xmath10 for which the @xmath11-axis is not the azimuthal axis . if we imagine two compact objects with",
    " centers \" located at @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the inertial @xmath2 system , then the @xmath11-axis connects those compact objects .",
    "that is , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "we introduce the coordinates @xmath16 as spherical coordinates relative to the comoving @xmath17 system .",
    "we will exclusively work with the _ comoving _ systems ( or simple translations or polar versions thereof ) , but we will often suppress tildes when doing so will not cause confusion .",

    "notice that the problem includes dirichlet conditions set on the inner boundaries of the spherical shells @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "the boundary condition set on the outer boundary of the spherical shell @xmath21 is of radiative type , and is here expressed in terms of the polar coordinates @xmath51 relative to @xmath52 .",
    "although this radiation condition is described precisely below , it may here be thought of as an inhomogeneous sommerfeld condition .",
    "( the inhomogeneity @xmath53 in ( [ eq : introhrwe ] ) is a nonlocal expression . )",
    "this paper will consider only the variable - coefficient _ linear _ problem ( [ eq : introhrwe ] ) .",
    "for numerical tests , @xmath50 is taken as zero on @xmath1 , but with distributional support , point sources , located at the centers , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . for this choice of @xmath50 , an exact solution is described in the appendix . while we only consider the linear scalar problem ( [ eq : introhrwe ] ) , the helical reduction of the einstein equations described in @xcite involves a tensorial field resolved into ten coupled  helical scalars \" @xmath56 each of which obeys a copy @xmath57 of the above equation .",
    "however , for this formulation @xmath58 is now not an external source , but rather is a nonlinear coupling function of the helical scalars built with lower - order terms including some first derivatives .",

    "mostly focusing on the 3d hwre in three cartesian variables on a rectangular block , this subsection gives a short overview of integration preconditioning for spectral - tau methods , in particular focusing on the kronecker product representations necessary for 3d .",
    "we hope that this overview will provide the reader with enough context to follow the heavy details encountered later when applying the technique on 3d spherical and cylindrical shells .",
    "our earlier paper @xcite gave a fuller account of essentially the same issues for 2d , many of which change little in going to 3d .",

    "that reference also discusses the necessary rescalings of these matrices for work with an arbitrary interval rather than the standard interval @xmath73 $ ] for chebyshev polynomials .",
    "of course , ref .",
    "@xcite also considered such expressions and identities , even for more general basis functions .",
    "a function on any of our 3d subdomains is encoded by the modal coefficients for its spectral expansion , and this set of modal coefficients is often here viewed as a direct ( kronecker ) product .",
    "for example , let us consider a rectangular block delineated by the above comoving coordinates @xmath74 , but for the rest of this overview let us suppress the tildes on these coordinates .",
    "suppose a function @xmath75 on the block is formally represented as a triple chebyshev expansion @xmath76 where @xmath77 maps our block to the standard cube @xmath73 ^ 3 $ ] .",
    "to get an approximation of @xmath75 , we consider the truncated series @xmath78 so that @xmath75 is represented ( either exactly or approximately ) by a three - index set @xmath79 of modal coefficients .",
    "we represent this finite collection of modal coefficients as a column vector @xmath80 , with components @xmath81 determined by the direct product representation ] which might prove advantageous for representation of the @xmath82 term in ( [ eqn : block_ibp ] ) .",
    "our choice ( [ eq : block_dprep ] ) has been determined by technical decisions made during the initial construction of our code . in any case , based on some experimentation , we believe this choice makes little difference , at least for @xmath83 ( well in the range of rotation rates we aspire to treat ) . ] @xmath84 a single matrix operating on the vector @xmath80 ( all modal coefficients representing the given function ) may then equivalently be considered as having block - elements which are other matrices .",
    "we always view the modal set for a function on a cylindrical or rectangular subdomain as a direct product of _ three _ one - dimensional sets .",
    "however , in the case of the spherical shells ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath21 ) , we sometimes view the set of modal coefficients as the direct product of only _ two _ sets , the set corresponding to the radial modes and the set corresponding to the spherical harmonic modes ( which involve both the polar and azimuthal angles ) .    in our notation , operators corresponding to a single dimension , that is `` simple '' matrices ( whose elements are numbers , not matrices ) , are usually represented by a capital in an ordinary font , such as the identity operator / matrix @xmath85 or the matrix @xmath86 which realizes differentiation by @xmath87 . matrices which act on the full set of modal coefficients are represented by a calligraphic capital , for example @xmath88 .",

    "that is , if @xmath75 has modal coefficients @xmath80 , then formally @xmath93 has modal coefficients @xmath94 .",

    "this choice would fix the integration constant ( a function of @xmath91 and @xmath92 ) in @xmath93 , but this empty row might also be subsequently filled with a  tau - condition , \" that is another vector chosen to fix a different constant .",
    "let us briefly review the key ideas behind the technique of integration preconditioning , continuing to assume a rectangular block subdomain and also assuming the operator ( [ eqn : hrweoperator ] ) for the hrwe .",

    "@xcite for nonlinear scenarios , @xcite for more complicated 1d operators , and refs .",

    ", we may express the operator in ( [ eqn : hrweoperator ] ) ( again with tildes suppressed ) as @xmath99 we view this equation as an _ operator identity _ , that is the partial derivatives see both terms like @xmath100 and @xmath101 to the right , and also the function ( not shown ) on which @xmath102 will eventually act .",
    "the chebyshev polynomials @xmath103 obey the three - term recurrence @xmath104 . here",
    "@xmath105 may be viewed as a suitable rescaling of either @xmath91 , @xmath92 , or @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , multiplication by the independent variable ( here @xmath105 ) is represented in the corresponding space of modal coefficients by a banded ( evidently a tridiagonal ) matrix @xmath106 . in fact , multiplication by a polynomial @xmath107 is similarly represented by a banded matrix @xmath108 .",
    "now , the matrix which represents @xmath102 is @xmath109 where each @xmath26 represents differentiation in the space of modal coefficients for one coordinate .",

    "as designed , the technique yields an algorithmic way to achieve a sparse spectral formulation of the pde problem with consistent incorporation of boundary conditions .",
    "however , particularly in higher dimensional settings , an integration ",
    "preconditioner \" may not be an optimal approximate inverse in any known sense ; as a result the technique would not seem practical in and of itself .",

    "further preconditioning_. in particular , studying our problem on a given subdomain ( spectral element ) , we have empirically demonstrated that block jacobi preconditioning ( with each block inverted by @xmath236 factorization ) is effective for the banded matrix produced by integration preconditioning . moreover , for the matching of subdomains in our multidomain approach the alternating schwarz method ( an elementary domain decomposition preconditioner ) works well .",
    "given that little seems known about preconditioning for modal methods , whereas preconditioning for nodal methods is well developed , we believe that our demonstration of effective modal preconditioning based on rather standard methods is remarkable .",
    "in addition to modal preconditioning , other aspects of our work are new from the standpoint of modal spectral methods , in particular its multidomain character and focus on a mixed - type problem . ref .",
    "@xcite already presented the outline for applying the integration preconditioning technique to higher dimensional problems , that is to pdes .",
    "while we have carried out and presented the details of such an application , our work has gone further in developing a 3d _ multidomain _ version of the technique ( ref .",
    "@xcite consider the _",
    "case in 2d ) . in particular , we have presented the details of gluing constituent subdomains , and how this gluing is reflected in the overall linear system . as another new , and unusual , aspect",
    ", our work is the first successful application of integration preconditioning to a three dimensional mixed - type problem , a problem with both elliptic and hyperbolic regions .",
    "whence it has numerically confirmed once more ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) that such problems can be well - posed ; see @xcite for a theoretical discussion .",
    "the use of a multidomain decomposition is of special interest for mixed problems like ours , since the type change need not occur in all subdomains .",
    "indeed , for our example , it occurs on a cylinder that intersects only the outer spherical shell .",
    "when the nonlinearities of the actual physical problem are included , this feature of our domain decomposition may prove useful , because the true physical equations will be only mildly nonlinear on the outer shell , with the strongest nonlinearities confined to subdomains on which the equations are elliptic .",
    "our work therefore suggests that we might treat the outer shell differently from the inner subdomains when solving the full nonlinear problem .      while we have demonstrated that our mix of methods delivers efficiency and remarkable accuracy when applied to a nontrivial 3d model problem , a number of issues merit further investigation .",
    "these include both particular challenges in the application of this paper s methods to helically symmetric general relativistic binary fields ( the problem of our interest ) , and numerical analysis questions pertaining to integration preconditioning as a method for more general problems .    the numerical analysis issues center on the value of integration preconditioning , or sparsification , in the solution of higher dimensional pdes , particularly in the context of a multidomain approach .",
    "here we have applied the method to only one linear pde , with an empirical demonstration of its success . for any given linear equation , a fuller investigation of integration sparsification for",
    "multidomain scenarios would focus on the interplay between condition number , field of values ( rayleigh quotients ) , and computational efficiency ( iteration counts ) .",
    "all of these issues would be examined both before and after some form of `` ordinary '' preconditioning , e.g.  the combination of block-@xmath236 and alternating schwarz preconditioning used in this paper .",
    "the sparse matrices produced by integration sparsification allow for quicker matrix multiplies in a krylov method like gmres .",
    "our work suggests that this advantage might be gained without large iteration counts , but the issue deserves more careful study .",
    "the efficient treatment of nonlinearities is also worthy of investigation , and any such study would build upon the results already given in ref .",
    "@xcite . at present , we are in process of evaluating integration sparsification in the context of these issues , mostly with 2d model problems .",
    "several challenges remain if we are to apply some variant of our method to the problem of helically symmetric general relativistic binary fields .",
    "first , we must test the efficiency of our method in solving a nonlinear hrwe . in practice , this should not be a problem .",
    "the strongest nonlinearities will occur closest to the black hole sources , i.e.  near the surfaces on which the inner boundary conditions are set . by choosing these boundaries some distance from the sources ,",
    "we can , at the cost of accuracy in mathematically representing the physical problem , reduce the severity of the nonlinearities . the real question , then , is not whether we can handle nonlinearities , but how close to the sources the inner boundaries can be placed .",
    "second , we must replace the outgoing radiative boundary conditions with  standing wave boundary conditions , \" as described in ref .",
    "this change is straightforward in a linearized problem , and , as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , should not pose great difficulty in nonlinear general relativity .",
    "third , we must move from the scalar problem considered here to the actual tensor problem .",
    "solution of the helically symmetric problem of a binary in full general relativity will require all the information in the tensorial fields , and the coupling of those fields .",
    "this proved to be the greatest challenge for the solution method presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , and it severely limited the achievable accuracy .",
    "we are confident that the method described in this paper will deliver the accuracy needed to find useful solutions .",
    "the methods developed here have been motivated by the problem of binary inspiral in general relativity . however , our methods may find broader use ; they might be applied to problems distinct from the helically symmetric mixed pdes of the periodic standing wave approximation . as a salient example , multidomain spectral methods are already being used in the elliptical problem of generating binary black hole initial data @xcite .",

    "<S> we describe a multidomain spectral - tau method for solving the three - dimensional helically reduced wave equation on the type of two - center domain that arises when modeling compact binary objects in astrophysical applications . </S>",
    "<S> a global two - center domain may arise as the union of cartesian blocks , cylindrical shells , and inner and outer spherical shells . </S>",
    "<S> for each such subdomain , our key objective is to realize certain ( differential and multiplication ) physical - space operators as matrices acting on the corresponding set of modal coefficients . </S>",
    "<S> we achieve sparse banded realizations through the integration  preconditioning \" of coutsias , hagstrom , hesthaven , and torres . since ours is the first three - dimensional multidomain implementation of the technique , we focus on the issue of convergence for the global solver , here the alternating schwarz method accelerated by gmres . </S>",
    "<S> our methods may prove relevant for numerical solution of other mixed - type or elliptic problems , and in particular for the generation of initial data in general relativity . </S>"
