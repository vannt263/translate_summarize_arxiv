    "the two - level model of atoms interacting with light fields  @xcite has often been used to explore optical cooling mechanisms  @xcite . its inherent simplicity ",
    "the atom has one ground state and one excited state  makes the resulting models amenable to analysis , but also suppresses mechanisms  @xcite that , in the appropriate parameter regimes , dominate the interaction .",
    "a notable example of such an initially overlooked mechanism in atomic physics is three - dimensional optical molasses  @xcite . by means of the two - level model",
    ", one can predict the equilibrium temperature , the so - called `` doppler '' temperature @xmath0 , of atoms in molasses to be @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the ( half - width at half - maximum ) linewidth of the transition from the excited to the ground level  @xcite .",
    "data from early three - dimensional molasses experiments contradicted this  @xcite , showing that the achievable equilibrium temperature was in fact much lower .",
    "this discrepancy was resolved independently by two groups  @xcite , both explanations relying on the inclusion of the manifold of magnetic sublevels in each of the ground and excited states . in particular",
    ", the motion of the atoms in the optical field leads to a non - adiabatic following of the magnetic sublevel populations , which gives rise to a strong viscous force and efficient cooling to temperatures significantly lower than the doppler temperature .",
    "we recently  @xcite explored a new scattering theory that deals with the interaction of light and matter in a unified form applicable from microscopic to macroscopic systems . in that work we only considered the two - level atom model and showed , in particular , how our model can explain such mechanisms as standard optical molasses and mirror - mediated cooling  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we extend this model to deal with magnetic sublevels , in much the same spirit as ref .",
    "in due course , this extension will enable us to deal with multilevel atoms interacting with an arbitrarily complex system composed of immobile mirrors , cavities , mems devices , etc .",
    ", without resorting to a quantized model for such a system .",
    "+ after we introduce the general extension in the next section , we then proceed to explore two prototypical systems  the @xmath3 transition , leading to the `` sisyphus '' cooling mechanism , and the @xmath4 transition  in section  [ sec : linperplin ] and section  [ sec : sigmasigma ] , respectively .",

    ", this interaction is accounted for by the multiplication of the various transfer matrices of the elements making up the system ; this model is , in principle , applicable to systems of arbitrary complexity .    finally , we recall that the diagonal elements , @xmath37 , of @xmath31 are the populations in each of the sublevels , whereas its off - diagonal elements , @xmath38 , are the respective coherences . the matrix elements of @xmath31 are obtained from the appropriate optical bloch equations ( see , for example , the procedure outlined in ref .",

    "we denote the diagonal element @xmath41 of @xmath40 , the population in sublevel @xmath42 , by @xmath43 , and the off - diagonal element @xmath44 , the coherence between sublevels @xmath42 and @xmath45 , by @xmath46 .    here",

    "the velocity - dependent force terms in the above expression arise through the doppler shifting of photons both between field modes in the same polarization and between field modes in different polarizations ; these mechanisms are accounted for by the diagonal and off - diagonal terms in @xmath9 , respectively .",
    "these terms emerge through the velocity - dependent terms in the generalised transfer matrix .",
