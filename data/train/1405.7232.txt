    "strongly correlated electron systems show a rich variety of unconventional phenomena such as high temperature superconductivity @xcite and quantum criticality @xcite  and their theoretical description and understanding constitutes a particular challenge . the origin of these correlations is the strong coulomb interaction , as particularly found in materials with partially filled @xmath11- or @xmath12-bands , such as transition metals , their oxides , rare earth and lanthanide compounds .    the coulomb interaction between two electrons , which scatter from orbitals @xmath13 , @xmath14 to @xmath15 , @xmath16 in the course of the interaction , is simply given by @xmath17 here , @xmath18 and vacuum permittivity @xmath19 ; @xmath20 is the electron wave function for orbital @xmath13 ; no screening by further electrons has been included in this bare interaction @xmath21 .",
    "we do not consider relativistic corrections such as the spin - orbit coupling here so that the one - electron eigenstates simply need to be multiplied with a spinor and the integrals @xmath21 are independent of spin ; the @xmath15 and @xmath13 one - electron eigenstates ( as well as @xmath16 and @xmath14 ) need to have the same spin though .    for practical calculations , it is essential to reduce the number of interaction parameters .",
    "often , e.g.  in dft+@xmath2 ( density - functional theory augmented by a hubbard-@xmath2 interaction in a static mean - field approximation ) @xcite and dft+dmft ( dynamical mean - field theory ) , @xcite one considers only the _ local _ interaction .",
    "that is , all orbitals @xmath22 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) are on the same site ; they might correspond to wannier orbitals @xcite localized around the same lattice site .",
    "this is justified not only because this on - site interaction is by far the largest interaction parameter , but also since non - local interactions between orbitals on different sites can be treated in simple ( hartree ) mean field theory in the limit of a large number of neighbors .",
    "@xcite certainly there are situations where such non - local interactions can be of importance , particularly in one- and two - dimensions , or also between transition metal @xmath11 and oxygen @xmath23 orbitals .",
    "@xcite    a further reduction of parameters can be achieved using the so - called slater integrals @xcite @xmath24 here , the underlying assumption is spherical symmetry , which allows for an analytical angular integration so that eventually only the integrals eq .",
    "( [ eq : slater ] ) over the radial part @xmath25 of the wave functions remain , see appendix .",
    "these slater integrals , the simpler kanamori @xcite interaction , and or even just a single @xmath2-parameter are commonly used in dft+@xmath2,@xcite dft+dmft,@xcite or full - multiplet configuration - interaction calculations .",
    "@xcite however , a crystal lattice is not spherically symmetric .",
    "it has a lower , e.g.  cubic , symmetry .",

    "[ sec : numeric ] , we calculate the quantitative deviations from spherical symmetry by means of maximally localized wannier orbitals . while the bare interaction in @xmath28 is still described reasonably well by spherically symmetric interaction parameters , the stronger @xmath23-@xmath11 hybridization in @xmath29 results in larger deviations ( @xmath6 ) . in a wannier basis which includes both the transition metal @xmath0and the oxygen @xmath23 orbitals , working with spherically symmetric interactions is justified . even for deviations between cubic and spherical symmetric interactions are only @xmath30 in this case .",
    "the effect of screening within the thomas - fermi approximation is considered in section [ sec : screening ] . for short screening lengths , deviations from spherical symmetry",
    "are even larger than in the unscreened case ; for realistic screening lengths , deviations are reduced but still significant for in a 3-orbital wannier basis ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "we consider the typical situation for transition metal oxides with an octahedron of oxygens surrounding each transition metal atom as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : octahedron ] .",
    "while an isolated transition metal atom would be spherically symmetric and the parameterization in terms of slater integrals exact , the oxygen octahedron reduces the symmetry to cubic point group symmetry @xcite around the transition metal atom .",
    "therefore , the fivefold degeneracy of the atomic @xmath11 level is partially lifted , leaving a threefold degenerate @xmath0and a twofold degenerate @xmath31level in the cubic environment . in the cases we consider ,",
    "the octahedron vertices are occupied by negatively charged ions . in this case , the @xmath31states , which have a lot of weight along the  lines , are higher in energy than the @xmath0states , whose weight resides predominantly in the space between the ions , see fig .  [",
    "fig : octahedron ] ( right ) .",
    "the effective @xmath0orbitals are a combination of predominantly transition metal @xmath11 orbitals admixed with oxygen @xmath23 orbitals . for many transition metal oxides ,",

    "since often @xmath61 in transition metal oxides , we consider in the following only the leading terms in the limit of large distance between transition metal and oxygen site . in this limit , the direct overlap @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( which is the overlap with respect to the one - particle hamiltonian , @xmath64 ) , and coulomb integrals between orbitals on different sites are small . in the following we",
    "hence restrict ourselves to all terms of up to second order in ( any ) of the above off - site overlaps , and obtain the following three contributions :    directly from the @xmath65 terms in eq .",

    "since for large oxygen - transition metal distances the inter - site overlap decays exponentially while the coulomb interaction decays like @xmath76 , we keep the term eq .",
    "( [ eq : ppdd ] ) .    finally , there is a contribution involving only one @xmath70 in eq .",

[ fig : octahedron ] ( right ) map the @xmath79 orbital onto a linear combination of the three @xmath32 orbitals , this is not possible any longer with the oxygen admixture @xmath81 in @xmath80 except for 90 degrees rotations .",
    "non - cubic rotations will put the rotated orbitals into positions where there is actually no oxygen site .    employing the cubic symmetry",

    "for the latter we have the three possibilities : the inter - orbital interaction @xmath85 , the hund s exchange @xmath86 , the pair hopping term and @xmath87 which for real - valued wave functions has the same amplitude as @xmath4 .",

    "for example with @xmath158 we obtain a similar deviation of 14% ( @xmath159ev , @xmath160ev , and @xmath161ev ) .",

    "the reason for this is that the exchange integral @xmath4 includes positive _ and _ negative contributions ; and for large @xmath150 , the negative contributions are more strongly reduced than the positive ones .",
    "for example at @xmath163 we obtain @xmath164ev for , which is larger than the unscreened @xmath165ev .",
    "as the increase is very small , the results are given to a higher precision than elsewhere in the paper . with @xmath166ev and @xmath167 ev , deviations are 6.2% for this screening strength .    in the limit of infinite screening ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath168 , one can show that @xmath169 .",
    "that is , one can describe this limit by one kanamori interaction parameter @xmath170 for spherical symmetry , and two ( @xmath2 and @xmath171 ) for cubic symmetry .",
    "numerically , we get however also for cubic `` @xmath11-only '' wannier functions @xmath172 for both and . the limits of strong and weak screening show that the idea that screening strongly reduces @xmath3 and hardly reduces @xmath4 is not true in general . for strong screening , @xmath4 is reduced as much as @xmath3 , since they are equal , while for weak screening @xmath4 is even enhanced .",
    "we have analyzed the physical origin and the magnitude of the difference between a spherically symmetric and a cubic interaction for @xmath0 orbitals .",
    "deviations are quite large for @xmath5 orbitals of heavy transition metals . since for these systems hund s exchange is paramount for electronic correlations,@xcite we conclude that a kanamori interaction with three instead of two independent parameters is necessary .",
    "unfortunately , this requires the calculation of one additional interaction parameter and hence a more thorough analysis of the interaction in dft+dmft calculations than customary hitherto .",
    "only if the oxygen degrees of freedom are included in the wannier projection , this is not necessary . in this case , however , the ( different ) @xmath11-@xmath23 coulomb interactions should be taken into account . for @xmath98 orbitals",
    "there is no such difference between spherical and cubic interaction .",
    "depending on the screening length , screening enhances or reduces the difference between spherically symmetric and cubic interaction parameters .",
    "screening can even enhance @xmath4 whereas @xmath2 and @xmath3 are always reduced . for thomas - fermi screening",
    ", @xmath173 is still significantly violated for @xmath5 .",
    "let us note that the simple thomas - fermi screening employed here is spherically symmetric , whereas the physical screening function obeys the cubic , not the spherical symmetry .",
    "this effect is an additional source of deviations from spherically symmetric interaction parameters .    for both @xmath98-only and @xmath0-only low - energy effective models",
    ", we have a kanamori interaction for cubic symmetry .",
    "this makes continuous - time quantum monte - carlo simulations @xcite very efficient because of an additional local symmetry , see ref .  .",
    "for the sake of completeness , let us briefly add the representation of the coulomb interaction eq .",
    "( [ eq : u ] ) by slater integrals . expressing @xmath174 in terms of spherical harmonics @xmath175 and with @xmath176 where @xmath25 is independent of @xmath177 ( or @xmath13 ) , the coulomb interaction eq .",
