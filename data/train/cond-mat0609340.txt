    "the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) describes many features of bose - einstein condensates ( becs ) of dilute atomic gases in an external potential at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "the properties of the ground state of the gpe with external potential have been extensively studied ; and many interesting phenomena have been reported .",
    "of special interest is that the mean filed interaction profoundly modifies the density profiles and the stability of the ground state @xcite .",
    "recently , the properties of the nonground - state stationary solutions of the gpe have attracted more attention both theoretically and experimentally @xcite .",
    "for example , the dark solitons have been created in the atomic gases with positive scattering length by phase engineering optical techniques @xcite .",
    "based on @xcite , one can classify the stationary solutions of gpe as symmetry preserving and symmetry breaking solutions . whereas the vortices and solitons observed in experiments @xcite are symmetry preserving solutions , which can be reduced to the eigenstates of the corresponding linear schrdinger equations , the macroscopic quantum self - trapping state in the two states @xcite and non - bloch state @xcite in periodical potential are symmetry breaking solutions , and they can not be reduced to the eigenstates of the corresponding linear schrdinger equations .    the system of gpe with double well is a good system to investigate the properties of the stationary solutions of gpe and also good for studying the special nonlinear dynamics , for example , the nonlinear self - trapping effect which was predicted theoretically in 1997 @xcite and realized experimentally @xcite last year .",
    "it has been shown that there are stationary solutions , which are either symmetry preserving or symmetry breaking , both numerically and analytically in this system @xcite . with the help of the double square well @xcite , which allows one kind of analytical solution for gpe , reinhardt and",
    "his collaborators have confirmed the numerical calculation for gpe with double - well trap @xcite .",
    "this provides one possible way to investigate the properties of the stationary solution for gpe with double well .",
    "it is interesting to know how the stationary solutions change as the nonlinear interaction increases or decreases , how the symmetry breaking stationary solutions emerge and how many kinds of the stationary solutions there are for the fixed nonlinear interaction .    in this paper",
    ", we present new stationary analytical solutions for gp equation with double square well .",
    "compared with the solutions of @xcite , ours can be reduced to the eigenstates of the corresponding linear schrdinger equations .",
    "it is this feature which enables us to understand the above - mentioned interesting problems concerning the stationary solutions for gpe .",
    "it allows us to obtain the critical nonlinear interaction value , over which the symmetry breaking solution emerges . and from the relation of the profiles of the stationary solutions and chemical potentials with the nonlinear interaction , we can directly see the means of the symmetry and symmetry - breaking and different stationary solutions for special nonlinear interaction .",
    "considering that the becs of dilute atomic gases are confined by a very anisotropic harmonic potential ( @xmath0 , where @xmath1 are the confined frequency in the y - z space and x direction ) and that the becs are loaded in a double square well in the weak confined direction ( x direction ) , then the dynamics of this system is governed by the 1-d g - p equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the 1-d reduced nonlinear interaction constant .",
    "the potential is of the form @xmath4 the stationary solution can be written as @xmath5 and after re - scaling the equations , we arrive at the equation for @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the total number of the atom .",
    "the energy and the potential are measured in unit of @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the length of the total space ( here @xmath12 ) . due to the double well case ,",
    "the stationary solution is just the real function , so we have assumed that our solution @xmath6 is real function . as in ref .",
    "@xcite , the solution of ( [ str ] ) can be written in terms of the jacobi elliptical function .",
    "generally , we have two different solutions depending on the relation of the chemical potential and the barrier height . first for @xmath13    @xmath14    where @xmath15 this solution is also valid for @xmath16 , which corresponds to the region of @xmath17 .",
    "it is easy to check that when @xmath18 , our solution is reduced to @xmath19where @xmath20 , @xmath21 this is nothing but the eigenstates of linear shrdinger equations for @xmath13 .",
    "we have two different jacobi functions for @xmath22 , corresponding to the region of @xmath23 .",
    "to the case with one node in the barrier region , the solution is    @xmath24    @xmath25    .",
    "the modular transformation of jacobi elliptic function [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]         in fig.3 , the symmetry breaking solution for negative nonlinear interaction has been presented up to @xmath26 .",
    "when @xmath27 , they are the same as the fig . 4 in @xcite but with a different order .",
    "same as the symmetry breaking solutions in positive nonlinear interaction , the first and fourth solutions emerge from the symmetry preserving solution at @xmath28 and at @xmath29 respectively .",
    "please note that the first kind of symmetry breaking solution emerges from the ground state and its chemical potential is less than that of the ground state .",
    "therefore this state is the ground state of the system ( from fig.4 ) .",
    "this is what is called the quantum phase transition in this system @xcite .",
    "this solution does not have any node and its profile show that the particle would stay in one of the wells for negative nonlinear interaction .",
    "the fourth solution includes one fixed node and a moving one .",
    "now the node moves from the well into the barrier region with the decrease of the nonlinear interaction .",
    "around @xmath30 the node is in the barrier region .",
    "again , the second and the third solution occur from the isolated point at @xmath31 in the diagram of the chemical potential with the nonlinear interaction .",
    "now their nodes become fixed . again",
    "the density profile has completely different behavior with the decrease of the nonlinear interaction .",
    "the second solution will collect the particles to one well but the third one keeps them in two wells .",
    "there is still another crossover between the third and the fourth solution near @xmath26 .",
    "that is why my order of the solution is different from @xcite at @xmath32 .        in fig .",
    "we plot the chemical potential as the function of nonlinear interaction both for symmetry preserving and breaking solutions . due to the high barrier ,",
    "the quantum tunneling effect between the two wells is small and the chemical potential difference between the ground state and the first excited state is small too . from fig.4",
    ", one can directly see that the symmetry preserving solution can be reduced to the eigenstate of the linear schrdinger equations ( @xmath18 ) , while the symmetry breaking one can not .",
    "to see this more clearly , we amplify the figure around @xmath18 ( fig(a ) is for the ground state and the first excited state and fig(b ) is for the second excited state and the third excited state ) . the embedded figure in fig.4 ( left )",
    "shows the critical point for the quantum phase transition @xcite .",
    "we denote the symmetry preserving solutions as `` l '' , and the symmetry breaking solutions and positive nonlinear interaction as `` np '' , and the symmetry breaking solutions and negative nonlinear interaction as `` n '' .",
    "it is clearly shown that the symmetry breaking solution can emerge from two kind of points .",
    "one is the bifurcation and the other one is the isolated point in this diagram .",
    "we arrange our solution in fig.1 , fig.2 and fig.3 in the chemical potential order .",
    "it is easy to see that the nature of the mean - field ground - state and the structure of the energy spectrum of the nonlinear system depend on the value of the nonlinear interaction .",
    "we have presented one new analytical solution which could be reduced to eigenstates of the corresponding linear schrdinger equations . and we have shown the clear and direct evidence to the relation of the symmetry preserving stationary solution and the eigenstates of the linear schrdinger equations . based on the origin of the symmetry breaking state , one can find two kinds of different symmetry breaking solutions , neither of which can be reduced to the eigenstates of the corresponding linear schrdinger equations and have one critical nonlinear interaction , over which the symmetry breaking solution emerge .",
    "one of the interesting things is that the first kind of symmetry breaking solution can exist under the following conditions : 1 . for positive nonlinear interaction ,",
    "it emerges from the first excited state and the third excited state ; 2 . for negative nonlinear interaction",
    ", it emerges from the ground state and the second excited state .",
    "we understand this based on the superposition of the eigenfunctions of the linear schrdinger equations . and",
    "high accuracy of the critical value of the nonlinear interaction has been found for the first kind of symmetry breaking solution which emerges from the symmetry preserving one .",
    "this explains why we can not find the symmetry breaking solution from the ground state for the positive nonlinear interaction @xcite .",
    "as this method is just valid for the small nonlinear interaction , we can not yet understand the second kind of symmetry breaking solution .",
    "but how the profile of the stationary solution change with the nonlinear interaction has also been presented .",
    "our calculation shows that the symmetry breaking solution satisfies the self - trapping condition .",
    "this will help to understand this effect from stationary solutions .",
    "considering the situations realized in the experiment , our model can be regarded as too simple . but this model can be solved analytically and is good enough to provide qualitative description .",
    "usually , one can understand the realistic double well by the quartic function @xmath33 .",
    "the chemical potential or the eigenvalue of gpe may show a little difference from the results of our simple model , but they are consistent quantitatively @xcite .",

    "this work is supported by the nsf of china ( no . 10444002 ) , srf for rocs , sem of china and srf for rocs of the shanxi province .    _ note added . _",
    "recently , we noted two papers @xcite which approach the same problem with similar techniques . in the present work we provide a more detailed analysis of the density profiles of stationary solutions as a function of the nonlinear interaction and",
    "we find a symmetry - breaking solution ."
