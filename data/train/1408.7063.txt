    "the discovery of the top quark at the tevatron in 1995  @xcite was the starting point of a new era of precision studies for the standard model ( sm ) . with the amount of data already collected by the lhc experiments ( atlas and cms ) ,",
    "precision tests of the top quark properties have become more and more common .",
    "nonetheless , the possibility of existence of physics , beyond the sm , hidden in the uncertainties of the experimental measurements , requires a criterious survey of the parameter space in the quest for signs of new contributions in the top quark sector . in the sm",
    ", the top quark decays almost exclusively to a @xmath1-boson and a @xmath5-quark and the decay vertex has the typical ( v - a ) structure .",
    "one way to probe the structure of the vertex and test the sm is to study the helicity fractions of the @xmath1-bosons produced in top quark decays , and/or the observables which depend on these helicity fractions  @xcite _ i.e. _ , angular and spin asymmetries , ratios of fractions , etc .",
    "the tevatron results on the helicity fractions , obtained by cdf and d0 , have been combined  @xcite , showing good agreement ( within 10% ) with the nnlo sm predictions  @xcite . at the lhc , both atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite",
    "have measured the @xmath1-boson helicity fractions in top quark decays .",
    "the production cross sections can play an important role , as well , in constraining the allowed phase space for the new couplings .",
    "the @xmath6-channel single top quark production is particularly relevant given its magnitude .",
    "measurements of the @xmath6-channel cross section have been performed by both the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite experiments at centre - of - mass energies of 7 and 8  tev . although smaller then the @xmath6-channel , the @xmath7 associated production cross section is also important .",
    "in fact , as the @xmath7 cross section is not affected by new physics contributions like , for instance , four - fermion contact interactions , it can probe the @xmath0 vertex in a model independent way .",
    "atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite measured the @xmath7 associated production at 7 and 8  tev .    in this paper , the results of the most precise measurements of the single top quark production cross section at a centre - of - mass energy of 8  tev at the lhc , are combined with the @xmath1-boson helicity fractions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) , obtained by the cms experiment to set limits on the real and imaginary parts of possible new anomalous couplings that could be present at the @xmath0 vertex . the topfit  @xcite code is used to perform the combination of the observables , as well as to extract the corresponding anomalous couplings allowed regions at 95% confidence level ( cl ) .",
    "the real and imaginary part of the couplings are considered . in order to describe the interaction , an effective field theory approach",
    "is used  @xcite .",
    "the most general vertex can be described by  @xcite    @xmath8    where @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 are dimensionless couplings that are , in general , complex . at tree level and in the sm ,",
    "@xmath13 and all the other couplings vanish .",
    "however , if new physics appear at the @xmath0 vertex , the new couplings @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 may acquire important corrections .",
    "these anomalous couplings can be tested in top quark decays by measuring the @xmath1-boson helicity states  @xcite .",
    "the results can be combined with the single top quark production measurements to improve the limits on the anomalous couplings  @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to recall the sensitivity to the new couplings at the lhc , in top quark decays , can be largely surpassed at a future linear collider ( ilc )  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1-boson helicity fractions in this paper were measured by the cms experiment at a centre - of - mass energy of 8  tev using a sample of @xmath14 events which decayed to the muon+jets channel .",
    "the sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 19.6  fb@xmath15 .",
    "the longitudinal and left handed helicity fractions are , respectively  @xcite , @xmath16 with a correlation coefficient @xmath17 and assuming a top quark mass @xmath18 gev . the measurement is clearly dominated by the systematic uncertainties .",
    "the most precise measurement of the @xmath6-channel single top quark production cross section used in this paper , was performed by the cms experiment  @xcite at 8  tev .",
    "signal events were considered whenever top - quark decay products were accompained with a high rapidity light quark together with a low @xmath19 @xmath5-quark .",
    "events were selected if they contained one isolated lepton ( electron or muon ) .",
    "the value of the top quark mass assumed in all simulated monte carlo samples was @xmath18 gev .",
    "the measurement , using a total integrated luminosity of 19.7  fb@xmath15 is , @xmath20    the effect of the @xmath7 associated production in the anomalous couplings fits , is also investigated .",
    "the measurement with smaller uncertainty , normalized to the sm cross section expectation , is  @xcite , @xmath21 the measurements of the single top quark production cross sections are assumed to be uncorrelated .",
    "by taking into account the analytic expressions introduced in  @xcite and  @xcite for the helicity fractions and single top quark production cross section as a function of the complex anomalous couplings , respectivelly , it is possible to determine , using topfit , the allowed regions for the couplings , provided a minimal set of measurements is specified . in the current paper ,",
    "the cms results of the helicity fractions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and the @xmath6-channel single top quark production cross section are , initially , used as input parameters to topfit .",
    "it should be stressed that no four - fermion contributions to the @xmath6-channel single top quark production cross section is considered  @xcite .",
    "no correlations are assumed between the helicities and the cross section measurements .",
    "the total uncertainty associated to each measurement is defined by adding in quadrature the corresponding statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the results are presented in terms of two dimensional plots of subsets of anomalous couplings ( assuming the others vanishing ) or individual limits ( assuming all other anomalous couplings vanishing ) , as convenient , to ilustrate each physics case .",
    "it should be stressed that the approach , although not fully general , is justified once different couplings indeed arise from different gauge invariant operators and the limited number of observables and their precision makes a global fit almost useless for the time being .",
    "limits are set by topfit , at 95%  cl , for a top quark mass of @xmath18 gev ( as for the lhc experiments ) , @xmath22 gev and @xmath23 gev .",
    "two different scenarios are considered :      in both scenarios several combinations of couplings are considered in order to ilustrate the potential of the physics case and give an idea of the order of magnitude of the 95%  cl allowed regions for the anomalous couplings , given the current results at the lhc .",
    "the effect of the @xmath7 associated production cross section at the lhc , as well as the recent results on the @xmath1-boson helicity fractions and the @xmath4 single top quark production cross section measured at the tevatron , are finally combined with the previous measurements to set 95%  cl limits on the anomalous couplings allowed regions .      in the following discussion , all couplings are assumed real .",
    "the @xmath1-boson helicity fractions ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) and the @xmath6-channel single top quark production cross section at the lhc were used as input parameters to topfit . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lim1 ] the limits obtained with the 2012 cms  @xcite results are compared with the previous results obtained in 2010  @xcite . in the left plot ,",
