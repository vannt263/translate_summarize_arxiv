    "ultracold atomic gases are increasingly used as quantum simulators to probe many - body physics @xcite .",
    "recent efforts have focused in particular on understanding superfluidity and cooper pairing in interacting fermi systems , including _",
    "_ the effects of varying the interaction strength , introducing population imbalance , and reducing the dimensionality .",
    "when these fermionic superfluids are described in the path integral formalism , the thermodynamic potential @xmath1 of the interacting fermi gas ( as a function of temperature @xmath2 and chemical potentials @xmath3,@xmath4 of spin - up and spin - down components ) is rewritten as a functional integral over a bosonic field @xmath5 that represents the field of the pairs .",
    "this field is introduced through the hubbard - stratonovich transformation that allows the exact elimination of the fermionic degrees of freedom and results in an action functional for the bosonic field @xcite . at first sight",
    ", one has only succeeded in rewriting an unsolvable functional integral over fermionic fields by an equally unsolvable functional integral over the bosonic fields .",
    "however , the bosonic field lends itself to an obvious simplification when one intuits that a ( uniform ) bose - einstein condensation of pairs is present . in that case",
    ", one can surmise that @xmath6 , i.e. all pairs are in the zero - momentum state so the field is a constant in real space .",
    "the functional integral can then replaced by its saddle - point value , substituting @xmath6 and dropping the integrations .",
    "the optimal value of @xmath7 is found by extremizing the action or , equivalently , by minimizing the thermodynamic potential @xmath8 with respect to the saddle point . when @xmath9 , the ( non - interacting ) normal fermi gas is obtained , when @xmath10 , the saddle - point approximation bears out a bose - einstein condensate of pairs .    in two - dimensional superfluid systems , the interpretation of the bosonic field is more subtle . to be precise",
    ", the condition for bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) has been defined by penrose , onsager @xcite and yang @xcite as the presence of off - diagonal long range order , i.e. @xmath11 . at the level of the saddle point , @xmath6 ,",
    "it is clear that a nonzero @xmath7 implies bec .",
    "however , as mermin , wagner @xcite and hohenberg @xcite pointed out , in the two - dimensional system fluctuations play a crucial role : they will prohibit off - diagonal long range order in uniform systems .",
    "these fluctuations around the saddle point are commonly taken into account through the bogoliubov shift @xmath12 , whereafter @xmath13 is treated as a small fluctuation so that only terms up to second order in @xmath14 are retained in the action functional .",
    "then , for a given @xmath7 , the thermodynamic potential @xmath15 is expressed as a functional integral over the fluctuation fields , with a quadratic action .",
    "the quadratic functional integral can be performed , and we obtain a fluctuation correction @xmath16 to the thermodynamic potential .",
    "the fluctuation fields need not be written down as complex fields @xmath14 resulting from the bogoliubov shift : equivalent results are obtained by introducing ( real ) amplitude and phase fluctuation fields through @xmath17 .",
    "the culprit suppressing off - diagonal long range order in 2d is precisely the phase fluctuation field @xmath18 .",
    "indeed , mermin and wagner show that @xmath19 due to the long - wavelength behavior of @xmath20 , the relative phase .",
    "according to the penrose - onsager - yang criterion this means that bose - einstein condensation does not occur .",
    "however , we can identify other interesting phases from a study of the bosonic pair field @xmath5 .",
    "firstly , @xmath21 does not imply that @xmath22 as noted by kagan in his study of quasicondensation @xcite .",
    "we can identify @xmath10 with the presence of pairing , and search for a transition temperature @xmath23 for pair formation separating the @xmath9 phase from the @xmath10 low temperature phase .",
    "second , although bec is suppressed , superfluidity can still be present in the two dimensional system below the berezinski - kosterlitz - thouless @xcite ( bkt ) temperature @xmath24 .",
    "the order parameter for superfluidity is @xmath25 , the superfluid density , defined as the phase stiffness and calculated as the prefactor of the @xmath26 term in the lagrangian for the phase field , as explained in more detail below .",
    "kosterlitz and thouless @xcite described a mechanism whereby phase stiffness can be lost , namely through the appearance and unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs that start to proliferate at @xmath24 and scramble the phase field .",
    "this mechanism was observed experimentally in an 2d atomic bose gas by dalibard and co - workers @xcite .",
    "when the bosons under consideration are composite particles , such as cooper pairs , a third relevant temperature can be identified , related to the density of states of excitations , or equivalently the spectral function for the fluctuations .",
    "as we will show below , the fluctuation terms in the density can be expressed through a spectral function @xmath27 describing the contribution of fluctuations with a given wave number @xmath28 and momentum @xmath29 . in the nozires and  schmitt - rink ( nsr ) formalism @xcite for the two dimensional system @xcite , the integral over the spectral function is divergent , invalidating the number equations @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "we show that this divergency is absent when we apply the formalism of hu , liu and drummond @xcite , which these authors dubbed the gaussian pair fluctuation ( gpf ) approach , to the two dimensional case .",
    "as we show below ( section [ gpf ] ) , the gpf approach allows to set up and simultaneously solve the gap and number equations also in the two - dimensional case .",
    "this allows us to derive results for @xmath32 that take into account fluctuations ( both phase fluctuations and amplitude fluctuations ) .",
    "the resulting fluctuation spectra can then be used to obtain the finite - temperature thermodynamics of the two - dimensional fermi superfluid , following the approach of salasnich for the three - dimensional case @xcite .    in studying the fluctuation spectra",
    ", we find that for temperatures above a critical temperature @xmath33 , the fluctuation spectral function @xmath27 becomes negative at long wavelengths ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this happens at a temperature above @xmath24 and ( obviously ) below @xmath23 .",
    "we interpret this temperature @xmath33 as the pairing temperature at which the pseudogap is open , inspired by the recent experiments @xcite which investigated pairing in ultracold 2d atomic fermi gases . for the ultracold atomic gases in 3d , the pseudogap state above the critical temperature is a subject of an intense study , both experimental and theoretical @xcite , and the similarity with the pseudogap physics in superconductors has not gone unnoticed @xcite . in the experiment @xcite , the spectral function for excitations of the fermi gas",
    "is determined through momentum - resolved photoemission spectroscopy . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the momentum - integrated photoemission spectra are measured , and the evolution of fermion pairing was followed from three to two dimensions by varying the strength of the confining optical lattice .",
    "both experiments reveal a non - zero pairing gap . while the experiments in @xcite were interpreted to reveal the pseudogap , i.e. pairing in a non - superfluid state ,",
    "superfluidity itself has not been observed in 2d yet .",
    "therefore , the existence of the pseudo - gap regime is not experimentally settled until superfluidity itself is observed at temperatures lower than the temperature for pair formation .",
    "we compare the fluctuation spectral functions derived from our microscopic ( gpf - based ) theory to the measured spectral functions for excitations , and we also compare the measured pseudogap temperatures with the calculated @xmath33 as a function of the interaction strength . we find that fluctuations indeed greatly lower the temperature range of existence of the pseudogap phase , especially in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "consequently , in order to obtain a complete phase diagram for the fermi gas in 2d , we must consider each phase taking in account fluctuations .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this problem has hitherto not yet been satisfactorily solved for the case of fermions in 2d because of the aforesaid divergence of the density due to fluctuations at finite temperatures . here , as mentioned above",
    ", we tackle the problem by correcting the nsr approach using the gaussian pair fluctuation theory ( gpf ) proposed by hu , liu and drummond @xcite for the three dimensional fermi gas .",
    "moreover , we extend the results to the case of imbalance .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ formalism ] , we present the divergence - free method for the self - consistent calculation of thermodynamic parameters of interacting imbalanced fermions in 2d taking into account both amplitude and phase fluctuations . in sec .",

    "[ phasediagrams ] , we discuss finite - temperature phase diagrams for the imbalanced fermi gas in 2d . in sec .",
    "[ experiment ] , the theory is applied to the interpretation of the experiment on pairing of cold atoms in 2d .",
    "the discussion is followed by conclusions , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] .    before going forward in the next section with presenting the functional integral approach in the gpf framework , it is useful to note that the gpf approach that we follow here is not the only way to avoid the divergence problem that occurs in the nsr description for the fermi gas in two dimensions .",
    "the nsr scheme and its modifications are related to the @xmath2-matrix perturbation approach , in which the effective interaction between pairs is taken into account diagrammatically . in this context , the divergence problem for a fermi gas in two dimensions can be remedied by taking into account higher orders of the @xmath2-matrix expansion  via an effective interaction between pair fluctuations @xcite .",
    "this interaction stabilizes the superfluid phase of the 2d fermion system at very low temperatures .",
    "however , in 2d the @xmath2-matrix method does not predict the universal jump in the superfluid density @xcite related to the bkt phase transition .",
    "a correct description of the superfluid density becomes possible by explicitly focusing on the phase fluctuations , as in the approach of refs .",
    "@xcite . within that approach , bosonic pair field",
    "is gauge transformed @xmath35 and a subsequent gradient expansion of the fluctuation action is performed for phase fluctuations assuming that phase gradients are small .",
    "this leads to a quadratic effective action functional of the phase field @xmath36 , which , as distinct from the scheme of ref .",
    "@xcite , has no divergence for @xmath37 .",
    "as far as gradients of the fields are assumed to be small , the resulting effective action is treated as a hydrodynamic action ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "the gradient expansion does not contain the _ a priori _ assumption that fluctuations themselves are small . in this connection",

    "@xcite to derive the effective hydrodynamic action for a fermi gas with a population imbalance",
    ". a non - perturbative approach was also the key to develop a description free of infrared and ultraviolet divergences for the 2d bose gas @xcite , that successfully describes the crossover between the mean - field regime and the critical fluctuation range corresponding the bkt transition @xcite .",
    "we consider a gas of interacting fermions in 2d , with a contact interaction and with @xmath38-wave pairing . in the ultracold regime where only @xmath38-wave interactions matter",
    ", these interactions only take place between spin - up  and spin - down  fermions ( in practice , these are usually two different hyperfine states of an atomic species ) .",

    "correspondingly , we will use the average chemical potential @xmath52 and the chemical potential difference @xmath53 . note that the total density is equal to @xmath54 in our units , so this means that we need to solve the number equation to fix @xmath55 ( in the non - interacting case , @xmath56 in our units ) . only with respect to the imbalance",

    "below , we demonstrate the key significance of taking into account of the last terms ( [ numeq - gpf1 ] ) for the convergence of fluctuation contributions to the fermion density in 2d .",
    "as stated in the introduction , in order to treat the fluctuations , there is an alternative to the bogoliubov shift @xmath102 , namely the parametrization in amplitude and phase fluctuations @xmath103 .",
