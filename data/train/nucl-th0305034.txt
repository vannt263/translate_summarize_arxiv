    "recent experimental activities on drip - line nuclei have opened up a renewed interest in the continuum spectra of finite many - body systems .",
    "these nuclei are often weakly bound , or may even be unbound , and a proper treatment of the positive - energy states is crucial for their theoretical description .",
    "the continuum influences the properties of loosely bound nuclei mainly through the resonant states , which have a dominant contribution both in the ground state , e.g. , through the correlations induced by the virtual pair scattering , and in the excited states @xcite .",
    "it is thus becoming more and more important to approach the structure of unstable nuclei from the nuclear reaction point of view@xcite .",

    "a single - particle resonance state can be obtained relatively easily when the mean field potential has a spherical shape . in this case , the single - particle angular momentum is conserved , and the schrdinger equation is reduced to a one dimensional differential equation for the radial motion . approximated resonance states are easily found by putting a system in a box and imposing a condition that the wave function vanishes at the edge of the box . with this boundary condition",
    ", the continuum spectra are discretized .",
    "it has been recognized that , for a resonance state , the single - particle energy is stabilized against the box size , while it changes significantly as a function of the box radius for non - resonant continuum states @xcite .",
    "a more consistent treatment for the resonance state is also possible for a spherical system .",
    "the resonance states are associated with poles of the @xmath0-matrix in the complex energy plane .",
    "one way to obtain the resonance states is to impose the outgoing wave boundary condition in the asymptotic region with a complex energy .",
    "the state which satisfies this boundary condition is referred to as the gamow state in the literature .",
    "a similar approach is used in the complex scaling method , which has been developped originally in atomic and molecular physics @xcite and subsequently been applied to nuclear systems @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the resonance states can also be found by monitoring the energy derivative of the phase shift along the real energy axis @xcite , where a maximum appears at the resonance energy . for a scattering wave function in a spherical potential ,",
    "a simple factorization formula has been derived for its energy and radial dependences in the vicinity of an isolated resonance state @xcite .",
    "this factorization property has been used recently in order to estimate the effect of resonant states on pairing correlations in loosely bound nuclei @xcite .",
    "a resonance structure is much more complicated for a deformed system , where several angular momentum components of the single - particle wave function are coupled to each other .",
    "a standard method to solve this problem is to expand the wave function on a discrete basis , which may be deformed harmonic oscillator wave functions @xcite or eigenfunctions of a spherical potential@xcite .",
    "the positive energy states obtained by diagonalizing the hamiltonian in such basis can describe properly the main properties of the resonant states@xcite , but this may require a large number of the basis set . a more direct method to obtain resonance states in a deformed system",
    "is to setup the coupled - channels equations for the radial motion and solve them for a complex energy by imposing the outgoing wave boundary condition at infinity for all the open channels@xcite .",
    "recently , this method has been successfully applied to the proton emission decay of proton - rich nuclei @xcite .",
    "this method has an advantage over the matrix diagonalization method that the wave functions are subject only to the radial mesh discretization error for the schrdinger equation and that the desired asymptotic boundary condition can be imposed independently of the size of the mesh interval .",
    "however , the description of resonant states with such complex wave functions is generally difficult to use in nuclear models , since all the evaluated observables become complex quantities if the rest of the complex non - resonant states is not taken into account .",
    "we thus prefer to keep the energy as a real variable here .",
    "the aim of this paper is to develop a practical method to obtain scattering wave functions in the vicinity of a multi - channel resonance state .",
    "a difficulty is that there are @xmath1 linearly independent solutions of the coupled - channels equations at a given energy @xmath2 ( @xmath1 is the number of included channels ) , whose asymptotic behavior are all different .",
    "for example , a physical scattering boundary condition is defined by requiring that asymptotically there is an incoming wave only in the incident channel . in this case , the equations have @xmath1 degenerate solutions depending on which channel is the incident one .",
    "since any linear combination of these @xmath1 solutions is also a solution of the coupled - channels equations , a problem arises as to which combination one should take in order to study efficiently a multi - channel resonance state .",
    "if the resonance width is extremely small , as in the case of proton decay , one can easily construct a resonance wave function by matching to a standing wave solution@xcite .",
    "however , this procedure is not applicable to a broad resonance .",
    "our method presented in this paper is to start with discretized states whose wave functions vanish at a given radius .",
    "this is an extension of the box boundary condition for a spherical system into the deformed regime . as in the spherical case ,",
    "resonances can be identified with those states whose energy is stabilized against the box size .",
    "this method provides the most convenient basis states , where the unperturbed states are already a good approximation to the true resonance states .",
    "in fact , as we will show below , the resonance energy thus estimated is close to the energy at which the first derivative of the eigenphase sum with respect to energy has a maximum . here",
    ", the eigenphase sum is defined as the sum of the phase shifts for the eigenchannels , for which the @xmath0- matrix is diagonal@xcite . in the field of electron - molecule scattering",
    ", it has been known that the eigenphase sum has the same energy dependence as the elastic phase shift in a one - channel case @xcite .",
    "using these unperturbed wave functions , we then employ the first order perturbation theory to construct wave functions around a resonance state .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss how to generalize the box boundary condition to a multi - channel case .",
    "this uses a generalized concept of node for a multi - channel wave function @xcite .",
    "we also discuss the method based on the eigenphase sum and compare it with the multi - channel box discretization method . in sec .",
    "iii , we introduce the eigenchannels and discuss their usefulness .",
    "we consider several cases : the uncoupled ( spherical ) case , a very narrow resonance , and a case where the coupled - channels equations are decoupled . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the factorization of the wave functions in the vicinity of an isolated resonance .",
    "we first consider a perturbation to the box discretized wave functions for a spherical system in order to re - formulate the factorization formula of unger@xcite , which was originally derived using the @xmath3-matrix theory @xcite .",
    "we then apply it to the eigenbasis wave functions , and derive a generalization of the factorization formula for a multi - channel wave function .",
    "we examine the validity of the factorization formula by comparing it with the exact solutions of the coupled - channels equations .",

    ", the factorization still works inside the potential , but the deviation becomes significant in the outside ( see the middle panel ) . by the energy @xmath176 , the wave function does not resemble the resonance wave function , and the factorization formula looses its applicability , as was already known for the spherical system@xcite .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , lejeune and mahaux used a solvable two - level model to argue that the energy dependence of the wave function components is quite different from each other and a simple scaling does not hold .",
    "however , this does not come out in the present study .",
    "the energy dependences are similar for all the angular momentum components , except for the @xmath177-wave which shows a non - resonant behavior .",
    "this different conclusion may come from the fact that here the calculations are done with the eigenchannel basis , in contrast to lejeune and mahaux , who worked with the physical basis .",
    "this fact again suggests that the eigenchannel basis provides a powerful means to study a multi - channel resonance .",
    "we have used the eigenchannel representation of the multichannel wave function to investigate the properties of a single - particle resonance in a deformed system .",
    "we first showed that the box boundary condition can be generalized to deformed systems if one uses the generalized concept of the wave function node , that is to impose the condition that the determinant of the wave function matrix vanishes at the boundary of a spherical box .",
    "we have solved the coupled - channels equations with this boundary condition and showed that the discretized energy is nearly a constant as a function of the box size for a multichannel resonance state .",
    "the energy @xmath35 and the width @xmath36 of the resonant state were also calculated by using the energy dependence of the eigenphase sum .",
    "we have next studied the properties of the eigenbasis which diagonalizes the @xmath0-matrix .",
    "we argued that the eigenchannel representation has the most direct connection to a multi - channel resonance state . using this representation ,",
    "we have derived a formula which relates the wave functions at different energies around a resonance state , and studied its applicability . for an isolated resonance , we have observed a nice agreement between the approximate and exact wave functions inside the potential radius at energies @xmath178 .    in many - body problems ,",
    "one often takes the single - particle states as a good building block to start with .",
    "this is the case , for instance , in the bcs calculation for a pairing hamiltonian .",
    "if one includes unbound states in the calculation , one then has to deal with integrals over a wide range of energies in order to compute matrix elements . in the vicinity of a narrow resonance ,",
    "the energy interval has to be taken small , which may be quite time consuming .",
    "this difficulty is substantially lessened if one uses the factorization formula derived in this article .",
    "work is now in progress which uses this formula for resonance contributions in a hartree - fock plus bcs calculation for deformed nuclei .",
    "we will report the results in a separate paper .",
