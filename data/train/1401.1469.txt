    "spectroscopy seeks to use the optical response of matter to determine properties of the constituent molecules .",
    "since this typically involves probing a sample composed of many molecules , it is necessary to relate the response of the entire sample to that of a single molecule .",
    "when the sample is sufficiently dilute , the signals from each molecule simply add and the total response is proportional to the molecular response @xcite . in denser samples , this picture must be corrected .",
    "the semi - classical approach involves a patch - up of macroscopic and microscopic levels of theory .",
    "the direct expansion of the polarization for a system of non - interacting molecules is linear in @xmath0 , as in a dilute sample ; we call this the microscopic semi - classical expansion .",
    "higher - order effects are then included macroscopically in an ad hoc fashion by solving maxwell s equations , resulting in cascading , which scales as @xmath1 , and local - field corrections which scale as @xmath1 and higher ( the clausius - mossotti relation ) @xcite ; we call this corrected picture the macroscopic semi - classical expansion .",
    "this phenomenological approach is very convenient and intuitive but is not systematic and one can not be sure what effects are left unaccounted for .",
    "historically , the above effects were first discovered experimentally and then added to the formalism .",
    "local - field effects were included in off - resonant frequency domain susceptibilities to resolve discrepancies of the calculated absolute magnitude with experiment @xcite . in the time domain , they were required when unexpected signals showed that the time ordering of short pulses is scrambled by molecules with long - lived polarization ( slow dephasing ) @xcite .",
    "various other experimental observables are altered by local - field effects , such as the transmission / reflection of a thin film @xcite and the rabi oscillations of a quantum dot @xcite , have been identified .",
    "similarly , cascading was introduced to account for new signals not included by the microscopic semi - classical approach @xcite .",
    "cascading signals arise when a molecule in the material interacts with the electromagnetic ( em ) field and a polarization is produced which propagates to interact with another molecule from which the signal is ultimately detected .",
    "the effective response function for cascading signals therefore comes as a product of two lower - order response functions corresponding to the two molecules ( i.e. @xmath2 like behavior can arise from a product of two factors of @xmath3 , @xmath4 from a product of two factors of @xmath2 , etc . ) .",
    "cascading signals have the same wavevector and dependence on the incoming field amplitudes as the original signals , making them hard to distinguish . various methods for separating out cascading signals from the higher - order process have been pursued @xcite . in the macroscopic semi - classical approach , this is calculated by creating a polarization and propagating with maxwell s equations @xcite .    in previous work ,",
    "stimulated emission signals were analyzed from a microscopic perspective of a quantum radiation field and a number of expressions that were formerly obtained semi - classically were developed in a simpler manner @xcite ( more general introductions to the quantum nature of the radiation field can be found in @xcite ) . in this paper , we extend this formalism to vacuum - mediated interactions ( vmi ) , and show how cascading and local - field processes , are caused by second - order in interactions with quantum modes . in the emerging picture , one of a pair of molecules interacts with one or more em fields before emitting into a vacuum mode .",
    "the second molecule subsequently interacts with this vacuum mode and possibly other em fields before producing a signal .",
    "thus , while the sample is taken to be non - interacting , an effective interaction is nonetheless mediated via the vacuum field .",
    "this quantum - field approach introduces cascading and local - field corrections in an elegant way .",
    "everything is systematically related to the expansion order and no ambiguity remains regarding what processes have and have not been accounted for .",
    "we find that ( _ i _ ) if all field modes are treated as classical , we recover the microscopic semi - classical result and the polarization is strictly linear in n. additional effects are obtained if we also add coupling to quantum modes and account for them order by order .",
    "( _ ii _ ) cascading and local - field effects are generated by including the coupling to quantum modes to second order ( representing exchange of photons between two molecules ) .",
    "the two effects have the same microscopic origin , which is not clear from the semi - clssical derivations .",
    "( _ iii _ ) forster resonant energy transfer will be obtained at fourth order in the quantum mode as will three - molecule processes .",
    "such higher - order effects depend on generalized response functions and are not obtainable from a semi - classical perspective .",
    "we limit our discussion to ( _ i _ ) and ( _ ii _ ) . including higher - order effects is straightforward .",
    "we focus on a heterodyne detection signal in which the impinging field modes are all in a coherent ( classical ) state and take the field - matter coupling to be dipolar so that the interaction hamiltonian is given by @xmath5 and the dipole operator is the sum of the dipole operators for each molecule @xmath6 .",
    "the electric field operator is partitioned into the sum of the classical and vacuum modes : @xmath7 here , @xmath8 is the temporal envelope of the @xmath9th pulse ( or the conjugate for @xmath10 ) and @xmath11 is its polarization vector .",
    "@xmath12 is the quantization volume , @xmath13 indexes the polarization of the vacuum mode and @xmath14 are vacuum mode annihilation ( creation ) operators .",
    "we begin with the superoperator expression for the heterodyne signal derived from the rate of change of the photon number operator in the detected mode ( @xmath15 ) @xcite : @xmath16\\right\\}\\ ] ] the symbol @xmath17 stands for the imaginary part and the subscript @xmath18 ( @xmath19 ) on an operator indicates its action from the left ( right ) . for brevity",
    ", we also define the linear combinations : @xmath20 @xmath21 if all field modes are classical , we recover the standard formulae for the heterodyne detected ( stimulated emission ) nonlinear signal in terms of the susceptibilities . as described in references @xcite , homodyne detected ( spontaneously emitted ) nonlinear signals arise from a @xmath22nd order interaction with a vacuum mode which is then detected . such processes are additive ( i.e. , the total signal for an aggregate of many molecules is simply the sum of the signals of the individual molecules ) .",
    "these processes therefore scale linearly with @xmath0 , the number of molecules in the sample .    like homodyne detected spontaneously emitted signals , cascades arise from interaction with a vacuum mode .",
    "the difference is that in cascading processes , the final signal is still heterodyne detected and the quantum mode merely plays an intermediate role , causing an effective interaction between molecules that generates collective signals .",
    "these cascading signals therefore scale as @xmath1 in the molecule number .",
    "the first step in evaluating the signal from eqn .",
    "[ eq : sdef ] is to factorize the density matrix and separate the vacuum mode from the matter degrees of freedom : @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the initial vacuum mode density matrix and @xmath25 is the density matrix of the material . to return @xmath26 to a population",
    "requires two interactions ( one to excite a coherence between @xmath27 and @xmath28 and another to de - excite it ) and so the lowest non - vanishing contribution is second order in the vacuum interactions .",
    "cascading is a two - molecule process in which one of these interactions takes place on the molecule from which the signal is heterodyne detected ( molecule @xmath29 ) and the other interaction takes place on a second molecule ( @xmath30 ) . for a product of commuting operators ( note that @xmath31 and @xmath32 act in separate spaces and therefore commute ) , @xmath33 .",
    "since the @xmath34 are c - numbers , @xmath35 and all interactions with classical fields are associated with a @xmath36 . since @xmath37=0 $ ] for any @xmath38",
    ", the final interaction on molecule @xmath30 must be the vacuum interaction ( @xmath39 does not vanish ) .",
    "moreover , the vacuum interaction on molecule @xmath30 must come prior to that on molecule @xmath29 since otherwise the trace over the vacuum mode would vanish for this same reason .",
    "an important consequence of this reasoning is that the relevant correlation function for each molecule will be of the form @xmath40 ( i.e. one `` @xmath41 '' and several `` @xmath42 '' indices ) as in standard response functions . in this sense ,",
    "nothing unusual happens to second - order in the vacuum modes .",
    "it is worth noting however , that the classical correlation function of the vacuum mode @xmath43 turns out not to contribute while the cascading and local - field corrections are determined by @xmath44 which would vanish classically but is finite for the quantum vacuum .",
    "this points to the fundamentally quantum nature of these signals and suggests that a broader variety of correlation functions may be accessible at higher order in the coupling to the vacuum modes .",
    "below , we explore the corrections to the response , at various orders in the incoming fields , due to interactions between molecules mediated by second - order interaction with the vacuum mode .",
    "we term these 2vmi corrections for shorthand and identify two relevent subsets .",
    "as we will demonstrate , 2vmi corrections come as a sum of products of pairs of molecular hyperpolarizabilities ( one each for molecules @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "when one of these hyperpolarizabilities is first order ( i.e. it is merely the linear polarizability ) , the process can be viewed as replacing the field that interacted with molecule @xmath30 by an effective field that then interacts with molecule @xmath29 .",
    "we term the corrections due to such processes  local - field \" .",
    "in the semi - classical treatments of local - field corrections , all incoming fields are replaced by effective fields while we only carry out this process with one incoming field .",
    "the additional corrections are obtained at higher - order in the vacuum mode . when neither of the hyperpolarizabilities is first - order , we term the process  cascading \" .    as described above , the correlation functions that appear in the 2vmi corrections",
    "are all classical response functions of the @xmath45 form . beyond the second - order in the interaction with the vacuum , generalized material response functions of forms other than the usual @xmath40 begin to appear @xcite . as an example , two processes that are fourth order in the vacuum modes ( 4vmi )",
    "are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig:4vmi ] ( though we do not treat them in this manuscript ) . the most obvious process at this order ( shown schematically in fig .",
    "( [ fig:4vmi].a ) ) involves two vacuum interactions each at two different molecules and can represent resonant energy transfer . a second process ( fig .",
    "( [ fig:4vmi].b ) ) involves three molecules and a single vacuum mode ( the equivalent process with two vacuum modes will involve only ordinary response functions ) .",
    "since only the interactions with vacuum modes may be associated with a @xmath46 , such higher - order processes access a broader array of material response functions . specifically , the processes depicted in fig .",
    "( [ fig:4vmi ] ) yield terms proportional to the non - classical correlation functions @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "such processes are missed by the semi - classical approximation and are of potential interest particularly for harmonic systems in which the ordinary response function @xmath49 vanishes and variations from this are easier to detect .",
    ": a two - molecule process involving either one or two vacuum modes .",
    "this can represent e.g. , resonant energy transfer .",
    "@xmath50 : a three - molecule process in which molecules @xmath30 and @xmath51 each interact with the same vacuum mode which then interacts twice with molecule @xmath29 .",
    "both of these processes involve generalized response functions .",
    "time progresses as one moves up the diagram and the vertical lines represent the density matrices of different molecules ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath51 ) .",
    "solid horizontal lines represent interactions with photons in the externally applied ( laser ) modes while the wavy lines represent interactions with vacuum - mode photons .",

    "the only possible process to this order is shown schematically in fig .  [",
    "fig : firstorder ] which gives @xmath54.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the molecules are indexed by @xmath55 while the @xmath56 run over cartesian coordinates and the @xmath57 tracks the hermiticity of each interaction .",
    "note that we have written the signal as a function of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , the central frequencies of the detection pulse and the interacting pulse .",
    "more generally , the signal depends on all the parameters that define the pulse envelopes .",
    "the tensor @xmath60 is defined in the appendix and accounts for the effects of the sample geometry .",
    "for a two - molecule sample , the near - field contribution goes as @xmath61 . in the case of an infinite homogeneous medium , we obtain instead the phase - matching condition via @xmath62 .",
    "this gives the 2vmi corrections to the first - order heterodyne signal .",
    "this is the same as the local - field corrections to first order in external fields since no cascading processes are possible at this order .",
    "the underlying physical process for these corrections to the linear signal is the same as for the radiation - induced intermolecular energy shift of two molecules ( or optical binding energy ) with the signal mode the same as the applied external ( i.e. , @xmath63 ) @xcite .",
    "the difference is that , since we examine @xmath15 instead of @xmath64 , the imaginary rather than the real part of the geometric coupling tensor ( @xmath60 ) is relevant . note that , since we consider molecules with no permanent dipole , we only recover the dynamic and not the static contribution .",
    "interacting with field @xmath65 . ]    moving to second order , we acquire another interaction with external , classical fields .",
    "the vacuum mode always has freedom to interact anytime after the first interaction in the series of classical fields but the vacuum interaction on molecule @xmath30 must be the final interaction for that molecule ( since all other dipole operators on @xmath30 are @xmath66 ) .",
    "assuming time - ordered pulses ( pulse 1 comes before pulse 2 etc . ) , there are five possible orders of interactions as shown schematically by the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : secorder ] . to exhaust all diagrams , we then permute @xmath67 to give the other 5 diagrams .",
    "the analysis of the linear response was carried out in the frequency representation . for higher orders ,",
    "the diagrams are more easily combined in the time representation and we proceed in this manner in the appendix .",
    "the result is most compactly expressed by defining a total response function : @xmath68\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath69 where the superscripts @xmath70 on @xmath71 indicate the dependence on @xmath72 and @xmath73 is defined in the appendix .",
    "we see that the time - representation yields compact expressions for the signal and that this approach reproduces the semi - classical result of a product of lower - order ( hyper)polarizabilities . note that the @xmath74 stand for the central time of the temporal pulse envelopes but that the signal generally depends on all parameters defining the pulse envelopes .",
    "when a series of temporally non - overlapping pulses impinges on a sample , the pulses that interact with molecule @xmath30 are delayed from reaching molecule @xmath29 ( on average , by the sum of the coherence decay time of molecule @xmath30 and the travel time between molecules ) .",
    "if the coherence decay time of molecule @xmath30 is long relative to the distance between pulses , the order of interactions can switch .",
    "that is , 2vmi corrections can scramble the time - ordering of applied pulses ( this is observed at third - order in external fields in references @xcite ) . to illustrate how the signal may be recast",
    "so as to highlight this scrambling , we examine the first term in eqn .",
    "[ eq : rtsecond ] and define an effective field : @xmath75 this permits the first term of eqn .",
    "[ eq : rtsecond ] to be written as @xmath76\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] from this form , it is clear that we may view molecule @xmath30 as generating an effective field the details of which are dependent on the shape of the impinging pulse as well the response of molecule @xmath30 .",
    "this effective field may therefore interact with molecule @xmath29 after the corresponding external field has already passed .    having performed the analysis in the time domain ( see appendix for details ) ,",
    "we may change to the frequency domain and give the resulting expressions for completeness .",
    "this is accomplished by substituting the electric field time - envelopes for their fourier transforms and results in : @xmath77\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath78          the total number of diagrams ( before accounting for permutations of the interaction order ) that contribute to order @xmath79 in external fields is @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the number of diagrams .",
    "third order thus contains 16 possible diagrams and most of these are of the local field type previously encountered thus far . from this point",
    "forward we will focus on the cascading diagrams , defined as those in which the result is expressed as a product of lower - order correlation functions of the two molecules .",
    "the total number of equal - order cascading diagrams ( those cascading diagrams in which each hyperpolarizability is of the same order ) that contribute at @xmath79th order in external fields is @xmath82 and there are thus only 5 equal - order cascading diagrams at third order ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : thirdorder ] ) . note that these will appear only at odd orders and third is the first order for which they appear .",
    "permuting the order of field interactions generates 25 additional diagrams resulting in 30 total .",
    "these diagrams carry various step functions and they may be combined along the same lines as shown in the previous section .",
    "the cascading response function for third order is thus : @xmath83 or , in the frequency representation @xmath84\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have used the shorthand @xmath85    as per eqn .",
    "[ eq : cascnum ] , there are 21 diagrams ( shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fifthorder ] ) at fifth order in the external fields .",
    "expressions for these diagrams follow in the same manner as before . considering only equal - order cascading contributions ,",
    "the signal will come as a sum of products of @xmath86 . because the even - order response generally vanishes ( for material samples possessing inversion symmetry ) , this is the first cascading term that we might expect to significantly alter the signal .",
    "indeed , it was found that fifth - order raman processes are generally dominated by cascading @xmath2 signals @xcite .",
    "expressions for cascading signals are traditionally derived semi - classically by creating a polarization and propagating with maxwell s equations @xcite while local - field effects are included by considering a cavity within a homogenous dielectric medium . besides obscuring these effects common origin in vacuum - mediated interactions between particles ,",
    "one can not know a priori whether or not all relevent effects have been included since the macroscopic semi - classical approach is fundamentally ad hoc . in this paper , we present a microscopic quantum field derivation that unifies local - field and cascading effects and is systematic , leading to a general class of corrections due to vacuum interactions .",
    "we find that the correction to the macroscopic response due to second - order interaction with the vacuum can be expressed as a sum of products of pairs of molecular response functions .",
    "this treatment leads to local - field and cascading effects that can alter the signal appreciably ( e.g. by overwhelming a direct process of greater interest @xcite , scrambling the time - ordering of externally applied pulses @xcite , or altering the magnitude of the response @xcite ) .",
    "although this result agrees with that of the macroscopic semi - classical approach and all correlation functions are of the @xmath45 form ( that of a standard response function from semi - classical theory ) , the approach immediately suggests processes of higher order in vacuum interactions .",
    "two 4th order examples are forster resonant energy transfer ( fig .",
    "( [ fig:4vmi].a ) and the three - molecule process shown in fig .",

    "the factors of @xmath88 come from the three interections in the expansion and the @xmath89 are cartesian coordinates .",
    "since we do not work in the rotating wave , we must account for both hermiticities of each operator .",
    "this is done explicitly for the vacuum mode above and is the source of the two different terms in braces . for the classical modes ,",
    "this will be handled with the @xmath57 factors while it will be included only implicitly for the material dipole operators .",
    "although we could proceed with the @xmath90 variables and will do so for higher - order corrections , we will demonstrate how the analysis goes in the frequency domain with the correction to first - order . to this end",
    ", we change variables to the time between interactions @xmath91 and perform several simplifications ( given in @xcite ) @xmath92 resulting in the following form for the signal @xmath93\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] to arrive at the above , we have also changed from time - dependent operators to a green s function representation : @xmath94 with @xmath95 a positive infinitessimal .",
    "we may now carry out the @xmath96 and @xmath97 integrations via : @xmath98 in the above integration over @xmath99 , the first term has poles in the upper half plane ( uhp ) and the second has poles in the lower half plane ( lhp ) . because @xmath100 , the first term picks up the positive exponential and the second picks up the negative exponential . since the sign of the pole also changes between these two terms , the sign changes cancel and the both terms contribute a positive exponential .",
    "to simplify the resulting expression while maintaining generality , we introduce @xmath101 we will also define @xmath102 since there is only one external field , this is the same as the usual first - order polarizability @xmath103 @xcite .",
