    "quantum gravitational effects must be important if the early universe were ever at temperatures of order the planck scale",
    ". this would be the case if slow - roll inflation were preceded by a big bang , where the initial singularity marks where the semi - classical theory has completely broken down .",
    "calculations near this regime remain prohibitively difficult .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible that quantum gravitational effects can be relevant at far lower energy scales than @xmath1 .",
    "this possibility is assumed in the field of quantum cosmology , where the semi - classical universe emerges from non - perturbative effects in quantum gravity , but at a scale where solutions can be trusted .",
    "this is called  creation of the universe from nothing \" @xcite , although it should be thought of as the emergence of a semi - classical universe from a regime not describable as a classical spacetime . in principle",
    ", the choice of parameters is the only freedom , and initial conditions are determined solely by the instantons and their euclidean action .",
    "the quantum creation of the universe from nothing has , over the years , attracted a lot of attention .",
    "most of the models discussed in the literature studied the formation of a closed universe , since it was difficult to see how a spatially infinite flat or open universe could emerge from a compact instanton . on the other hand",
    ", the instanton describing the nucleation of a bubble universe from a false vacuum provides an example of how to go around this objection .",
    "the symmetry of the decay process is such that the interior of the bubble can be shown to be a spatially infinite open universe @xcite whose big bang surface coincides with the lightcone emanating from the nucleation center of the bubble . using a somewhat similar strategy",
    ", one could imagine an instanton that describes the formation of an open universe from nothing , in other words , a euclidean solution similar to the bubble nucleation instanton , but without the false vacuum region .",
    "solutions of this type were first described in @xcite .",
    "one characteristic property of such instantons is that they are singular .",
    "it is precisely the existence of this singularity which eliminates the possibility of including the false vacuum region in the lorentzian continuation of these instantons . on the other hand ,",
    "the singularities are mild enough that their euclidean action is finite , suggesting that one should consider these solutions as meaningful contributions to the path integral .",
    "nevertheless , the validity of these types of instantons was called into question by several authors @xcite . in particular , it was realized in @xcite that the admittance of such singular instantons would imply the possibility for minkowski space to decay by an analogous process .",
    "the conceptual difficulty introduced by the hawking - turok ( ht ) singularities motivated people to look for alternative instantons describing creation of an open universe from nothing .",
    "one suggestion put forward in @xcite was to consider the singularity as resulting from the dimensional reduction of a smooth higher - dimensional solution .",
    "this was described in @xcite using a 5d solution whose @xmath2 extra dimension smoothly degenerates in a particular region of the four - dimensional space .",
    "looking at this solution from a purely four - dimensional point of view , one recovers the same type of singular structure introduced in @xcite .",
    "the higher - dimensional geometry is perfectly smooth , just like a bubble of nothing @xcite . adding extra dimensions to the instanton solutions",
    "forces one to incorporate new fields capable of stabilizing the new moduli . in the following",
    "we will show that adding these new fields has important consequences , not only in the lorentzian continuation of the solution but for the euclidean instanton itself .    an alternative proposal to effectively eliminate the singularities from hawking - turok instantons",
    "was presented in @xcite .",
    "these solutions are supplemented by the presence of a membrane that allows one to cut off the instantons before reaching the singularity .",
    "the instanton solutions we introduce here exhibit characteristics of both of these resolutions in a natural way . in our scenario ,",
    "the four - dimensional spacetime is a 6d flux compactification with all moduli sufficiently stabilized , and which is manifestly smooth .",

    "we will consider the creation of an open 4d universe from a six dimensional theory .",
    "the existence of extra dimensions allows us to obtain a compact , smooth solution of the higher - dimensional euclidean equations of motion which would be singular from a purely 4d point of view , similar to what was found in @xcite .",
    "the analytic continuation of this solution into the lorentzian regime leads to a kaluza - klein cosmological scenario .",
    "we are therefore led to include additional gauge fields in our model whose fluxes stabilize the extra dimensions and yield a viable cosmology . however , adding this flux over the compactified space creates an obstacle to the smooth degeneration of the extra dimensions .",
    "we solve this problem just as in the bubble of nothing solutions recently found in flux compactifications @xcite , i.e. , by introducing new degrees of freedom into the theory that regularize the singularities with charged solitonic branes at the degeneration loci .",
    "one can think of these branes from a lower - dimensional perspective in a dualized theory @xcite effectively recovering the idea envisioned in @xcite .",

    "importantly , this intricate multiverse does not admit sensible solutions eternal to the past @xcite , and it is therefore still necessary to seek a theory of initial conditions .",

    "in the rest of the paper we will take for simplicity the case @xmath40 and set @xmath41 in other words , we will focus here on finding the instanton asymptotic to a minkowski ( @xmath22 ) compactification , or more precisely the open frw compactification with vanishing effective 4d vacuum energy .    as shown in @xcite , the presence of magnetic flux threading the extra dimensions",
    "can only be made compatible with the boundary conditions imposed in eq .",
    "( [ instanton - bc ] ) if we incorporate a solitonic magnetically charged brane at @xmath42 .",
    "one can show that the most general smooth solution describing this core is given by the taylor expansion @xmath43 note that the local geometry around this point is similar to the charged generalization of the bubble of nothing solutions discussed in @xcite . comparing this solution to the hawking - turok instanton",
    ", we see that it is this codimension three soliton which permits a regular geometry , avoiding the singularity present in the 4d description .    on the other side , near the horizon at @xmath44 ,",

    "the interesting point is that one can choose the parameters of the theory such that the subsequent evolution is in the basin of attraction of a flux vacuum , i.e. , a four - dimensional open universe .",
    "any viable model should ensure the existence of a period of slow - roll inflation within the bubble universe .",
    "a realistic treatment is beyond the scope of this paper , and it seems likely one will need to add new ingredients to our toy model to satisfy observational constraints .",

    "instead , the radion @xmath58 rolls to infinity , and the region ii geometry is actually 6d de sitter space .",

    "the inflationary solution in figs .",
    "( [ infregion1]-[infallregion2 ] ) falls just below this threshold , so the point @xmath49 , @xmath78 , @xmath83 , @xmath77 is very near the boundary to decompactification .",
    "finally , in the limit of large @xmath67 one encounters the situation where the values of the matter fields necessarily do not change from those at the core of the defect , i.e. , @xmath84 .",
    "one can think of these solutions as describing a monopole brane whose core is larger than the hubble distance of @xmath31 .",
    "this is nothing more than topological inflation @xcite in the 6d theory .",
    "a point in parameter space just within this regime is @xmath49 , @xmath78 , @xmath85 , @xmath77 .",
    "it is interesting to note that the instanton solutions presented in this case pick out an anisotropic slicing of @xmath31 associated with the orientation of the defect .",
    "one could thus envision a four - dimensional version of this scenario in which the instanton singles out an anisotropic slicing of 4d de sitter space .",
    "we will describe such a case in a subsequent paper .",
    "we have identified 6d instantons that describe the creation from nothing of an open 4d universe in the context of flux compactifications .",
    "the higher - dimensional nature eliminates the singularities found in the 4d instantons of this type @xcite .",
    "the core of the brane allows for a smooth degeneration of the extra - dimensional space , acting at the same time as a source for the magnetic flux that is ultimately responsible for the stabilization , in the asymptotic region , of the modulus associated with the extra dimensions .",
    "the region of the geometry near the brane resembles an inside - out version of the bubble of nothing solutions previously investigated @xcite . in a sense",
    "this type of instanton causes the  opposite \" process as the bubble of nothing decay .",
    "this reasoning might suggest that a universe created from a bubble _ from _ nothing could decay by a bubble _ of _ nothing .",
    "we found evidence here that this is not the case , since the parameters of the theory alone seem to determine the 4d effective tension of the domain wall leading to nothing . we have found a monotonic deformation of bubble of nothing solutions to bubble from nothing solutions as one increases the tension of the brane .",
    "the critical solution between these two classes is a flat brane , which in turn suggests that flux compactifications reach an island of stability against decay via bubbles of nothing in a similar manner that coleman - de luccia transitions are absent for sufficiently negative vacuum energy @xcite .",
    "this also suggests that a supersymmetric version of our theory will possess critical bubble solutions , rendering it stable with respect to bubble of nothing decays , as expected on general grounds . due to the impossibility of minkowski domain walls in de sitter space ,",
    "the bubble of nothing @xmath86 bubble from nothing transition is less sharp in de sitter flux compactifications .",
    "most of the bubble from nothing solutions of the type described in this paper would not yield a realistic 4d universe , since they do not have enough slow - roll inflation within the bubble .",
    "nevertheless , we have found a neighborhood in parameter space that leads to a significant number of e - foldings .",
    "while the parameters are fine - tuned , the initial conditions are entirely determined by regularity of the instanton .",
    "such initial conditions would seem completely fine tuned without quantum cosmology , since we would have to position the inflaton at the top of its potential to tremendous accuracy by hand .",
    "the only dynamical quantity which we chose by hand is the flux number @xmath11 , although this is in principle determined by the corresponding value of the euclidean action .",
    "interestingly , this opens up the possibility of having a discrete prediction for values of the curvature parameter @xmath87 today , alleviating the problems with the continuum of solutions found in the hawking - turok instantons .",
    "this is related to the fact that our instanton is not singular , so we do not have the extra degree of freedom found in the original ht instantons .",
    "our instanton could also lead to distinctive signatures in cosmological perturbations that could be investigating along the lines of @xcite .",
    "we should mention that even if the 4d universe obtained from our toy model were to have enough e - foldings of slow - roll inflation , one must additionally ensure that the spectrum of perturbations is consistent with observations possibly requiring the inclusion of further ingredients in the theory to flatten and lower the inflaton potential .",
