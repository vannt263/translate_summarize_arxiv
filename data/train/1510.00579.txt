    "this is an old and a well - studied problem with applications to insurance , finance , traffic and reliability , see  @xcite , nevertheless there is hardly any literature on the inhomogeneous case . in the body of the paper , we consider the continuous time poisson framework but outline the translation to the inhomogeneous bernoulli case ( where zeroes take the role of epochs ) in section  [ sec : discrete ] .",
    "the asymptotics of the tail @xmath10 is fairly easy to obtain in the homogeneous case where a renewal argument easily gives @xmath22 as @xmath23 , with @xmath24 being a root of a certain equation , see proposition  [ prop : homogen ] below .",
