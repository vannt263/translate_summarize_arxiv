    "in this paper we study a family of graphs that generalises the class of cayley graphs .",

    "cayley graphs were introduced by arthur cayley in 1878 to explain the concept of an abstract group given by a set of generators @xcite .",
    "there are many meaningful applications of cayley graphs in molecular biology , computer science and coding theory @xcite .",
    "because of their symmetry properties , cayley graphs are used as models for many interconnection networks .",
    "moreover various generalisations of cayley graphs have been introduced in the literature as prototypes of transitive graphs with some degree of success : for instance , quasi - cayley graphs by gauyacq @xcite , various kinds of groupoid graphs by mwambene @xcite , group action graphs by annexstein et al @xcite , and general semigroup graphs by kelarev and the second author @xcite .",
    "one of the advantages of using cayley graphs as models of networks is that their vertex - transitivity makes it possible to implement the same routing and communication scheme at each node of the network . at each vertex @xmath3 of @xmath17",
    "the edges from @xmath3 go to the vertices @xmath18 for @xmath19 .",
    "thus we may view @xmath8 as a ` connection subset ' @xmath20 of permutations of @xmath1 ( where @xmath21 is the permutation @xmath22 ) that determines adjacency locally at each vertex .",
    "a two - sided cayley graph also possesses this local connection property , and is more general in the sense that the connection subset of permutations may act _ on both sides _ , that is to say , we consider permutations of the form @xmath23 for certain @xmath24 .",
    "[ def:2sc ] for non - empty subsets @xmath0 of a group @xmath1 , we define the _ two - sided cayley graph _ @xmath2 as the ( directed ) graph with vertex set @xmath1 with an arc from @xmath3 to @xmath4 if and only if @xmath5 for some @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the _ connection set _ of @xmath2 is defined as the set @xmath25 .",
    "we note that the edges of @xmath2 from a vertex @xmath3 go to the vertices @xmath26 , for @xmath27 .",
    "if the adjacency relation is symmetric , in the sense that @xmath28 is an arc if and only if @xmath29 is an arc , then @xmath30 will be regarded as an undirected graph .",
    "conditions for this to occur and also for the graph to contain no loops or multiple edges , that is to say , conditions for @xmath30 to be a simple undirected graph , can be given in terms of properties of @xmath31 and @xmath32 as follows .",
