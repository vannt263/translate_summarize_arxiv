    "if @xmath5 is a @xmath6 real or complex matrix and @xmath7 is a matrix norm , the spectral radius @xmath8 of the matrix @xmath5 admits the well - known characterisation @xmath9 a result known as gelfand s formula . the _ joint spectral radius _ generalises this concept to sets of matrices . given a finite set of @xmath0 real matrices @xmath10 , we by analogy define the joint spectral radius @xmath11 to be the quantity @xmath12 a definition introduced by g .- c .",
    "rota and g.  strang in 1960 @xcite ( reprinted in @xcite ) .",
    "note that the pairwise equivalence of norms on finite dimensional spaces implies that the quantity @xmath11 is independent of the choice of norm used in the definition .",
    "the joint spectral radius has been found to arise naturally in a range of mathematical contexts including control and stability @xcite , coding theory @xcite , the regularity of wavelets and other fractal structures @xcite , numerical solutions to ordinary differential equations @xcite , and combinatorics @xcite .",
    "as such the problem of accurately estimating the joint spectral radius of a given finite set of matrices is a topic of ongoing research interest @xcite .",
    "in this paper we study a property related to the computation of the joint spectral radius of a set of matrices , termed the _ finiteness property_. a set of @xmath0 real matrices @xmath13 is said to satisfy the finiteness property if there exist integers @xmath14 such that @xmath15 .",
    "the _ finiteness conjecture _ of j.  lagarias and y.  wang @xcite asserted that every finite set of @xmath0 real matrices has the finiteness property ; a conjecture equivalent to this statement was independently posed by l.  gurvits in @xcite , where it was attributed to e.  s.  pyatnitski .",
    "in special cases , this finiteness property is known to be true , see for example @xcite .",
    "the existence of counterexamples to the finiteness conjecture was established in 2002 by t. bousch and j. mairesse @xcite , with alternative constructions subsequently being given by v.  blondel , j.  theys and a.  vladimirov @xcite and v.  s.  kozyakin @xcite . however , in all three of these proofs it is shown only that a certain family of pairs of @xmath1 matrices must contain a counterexample , and no explicit counterexample has yet been constructed .",
    "the problem of constructing an explicit counterexample has been remarked upon as difficult , with g.  strang commenting that an explicit counterexample may never be established @xcite . in this paper , we resolve this issue by giving the first completely explicit construction of a counterexample to the lagarias - wang finiteness conjecture .",
    "let us define a pair of @xmath1 real matrices by @xmath16 and for each @xmath17 $ ] let us define @xmath18 .",
    "the construction of blondel - theys - vladimirov @xcite shows that there exists @xmath17 $ ] for which @xmath19 does not satisfy the finiteness property .",
    "the proof operates indirectly by demonstrating that the set of all parameter values @xmath20 for which the finiteness property _ does _ hold is insufficient to cover the interval @xmath21 $ ] . in this paper",
    "we extend @xcite substantially by describing the behaviour of @xmath22 as the parameter @xmath20 is varied in a rather deep manner .",
    "this allows us to prove the following theorem :    [ counter ] let @xmath23 denote the sequence of integers defined by @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 for all @xmath27 , and let @xmath28 denote the sequence of fibonacci numbers , defined by @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 for all @xmath32 . define a real number @xmath33 $ ] by @xmath34 then this infinite product converges unconditionally , and @xmath4 does not have the finiteness property .",
    "the convergence in both of the limits given in theorem  [ counter ] is extremely rapid , being of order @xmath35 where @xmath36 is some constant and @xmath37 is the golden ratio .",
    "an explicit error bound is given subsequently to the proof of theorem  [ counter ] .",
    "using this bound we may compute the approximation @xmath3 which is rigorously accurate to all decimal places shown .",

    "each @xmath17 $ ] let us write @xmath38 and @xmath39 so that @xmath40 .",
    "the principal technical question which is addressed in this paper is the following : if we are given that for some finite sequence of values @xmath41 , the matrix @xmath42 is `` large '' in some suitable sense  for example , if its spectral radius is close to the value @xmath43 - then what may we deduce about the combinatorial structure of the sequence of values @xmath44 , and how does this answer change as the parameter @xmath20 is varied ?",
    "a key technical step in the proof of theorem  [ counter ] , therefore , is to show that the magnitude of the product is maximised when the sequence @xmath45 is a _ balanced word_. this result depends in a rather essential manner on several otherwise unpublished results from the fourth named author s 2005 phd thesis @xcite , which are substantially strengthened in the present paper .    in the following section we shall introduce the combinatorial ideas needed to describe balanced words .",
    "we are then able to state our main technical theorem , describe its relationship to previous research in ergodic theory and the theory of the joint spectral radius , and give a brief overview of how theorem  [ counter ] is subsequently deduced .",
