    "firstly , aperture corrections were made , reducing the magnitudes to a standard circular aperture of metric diameter 63.9kpc .",
    "these aperture corrections are dependent on the cosmological model , due to differences in the angular diameter versus redshift relation ; however , the changes from the standard @xmath8 , @xmath9 model are generally small , @xmath23 mag , and so the data were converted to 63.9kpc in the @xmath24 , @xmath9 model , and the model  to  model variations were included in the predicted model tracks .",
    "the 63.9kpc aperture was chosen since this had been adopted for the 6c observations wherever possible . in cases where there was a nearby companion galaxy , or other problems prevented the use of the full aperture , magnitudes for the 6c galaxies were determined for smaller apertures and aperture corrections applied by eales _",
    "( 1997 ) ; for galaxies at redshifts @xmath21 they assumed that the radio galaxies follow an elliptical galaxy growth curve ( sandage 1972 ) , and at redshifts @xmath25 they assumed that the growth curve for the luminosity @xmath26 of the galaxy within radius @xmath27 could be represented by @xmath28 .",
    "the k  magnitudes of the 3cr galaxies were originally determined within a 9 arcsec diameter aperture . at large redshifts , this is almost equivalent to 63.9 kpc , and so the aperture corrections were small .",
    "larger aperture corrections were necessary at low redshifts since the 9 arcsec aperture included only the central regions of the galaxy ( lilly & longair 1984 ) .",
    "a de vaucouleurs profile for giant ellipticals was used to correct these magnitudes to the standard diameter , since the analysis of best _ et al . _",

    "one of the intriguing features of the comparison of the 3cr and 6c data is that , although they are in excellent agreement at redshifts @xmath31 , there is a progressive shift in their mean magnitudes at greater redshifts , the mean k - magnitude of the 6c galaxies at @xmath32 being about 0.6 magnitudes fainter on average than the 3cr galaxies ( eales _ et al .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : 1 ] , where the boxes , representing 3cr galaxies , lie towards the low limit of the distribution of the crosses , 6c galaxies , at @xmath32 .    given the quite large dispersion about the mean k - z relation ,",
    "bayesian statistics have been used to investigate the significance of this magnitude difference and how it evolves with redshift without making restrictive assumptions about the underlying distribution ( see figure  [ fig : 2 ] ) .",
    "the results show clearly the mean difference between the two data sets of about 0.6 magnitudes at high redshift / early times and its decrease to zero at later times .",
    "the mean value of @xmath33 increases slightly at the lowest redshifts to about 0.15 magnitudes , but this increase is not significant . at high redshifts the difference in k - magnitudes between 3cr and 6c",
    "galaxies is significant at the 95% confidence limit .",
    "this result for the 6c galaxies is mirrored by that of the still fainter 7c radio galaxies ( willott , priv comm ) .",
    "however , mccarthy ( 1999 ) and van breugel ( 1998 ) have studied the k - z relation for radio galaxies in the mrc 1jy sample , which contains sources with flux densities @xmath34jy at 408mhz ( @xmath35jy ) from the molonglo reference catalogue ( mccarthy et al 1996 ) , and they find that the mean k - band magnitudes of the mrc radio galaxies to be only 0 to 0.2 magnitudes fainter than the 3cr , a much smaller difference than for the 6c sources .",
    "the @xmath36 spectroscopic incompleteness of this sample may introduce a bias in that it is more difficult to obtain redshifts for intrinsically fainter galaxies , but mccarthy argues that this bias is unlikely to be sufficiently great to alter the mean magnitude of the mrc galaxies by 0.6 magitudes .",
    "the important aspect of this discussion is whether or not there is a correlation between radio luminosity and k - absolute magnitude , as would be the case if it is accepted that there is a real difference between the k - z diagrams for the 3cr and 6c samples . for the purpose of the present analysis",
    ", we have assumed that the difference between the 6c and 3cr samples , being smaller than the scatter within either sample , can be ignored .",
    "therefore , we have taken mean values and dispersions for the combined sample .",
    "these are indicated by the solid triangles and associated error bars in fig .",
    "[ fig : 1 ] .    a literal interpretation of the k - z diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : 1 ] suggests that to a good approximation the luminous radio galaxies belong to a single population of passively evolving galaxies of the same stellar mass .",
    "the galaxies also have the same characteristic radii of about 10kpc over the entire range @xmath37 ( best et al 1998 , mclure & dunlop 2000 ) , which supports this conclusion . as discussed by best _",
    "_ , this is a somewhat surprising result , since the preferred hierarchical clustering picture of galaxy formation predicts that the masses and radii of galaxies would grow significantly over the redshift range considered .",
    "evidence suggests that galaxy environments also differ with redshift ; high redshift 3cr galaxies seem to belong to proto - cluster environments , whereas low redshift galaxies are more commonly found in small groups or otherwise isolated environments .",
    "intuitively , it seems difficult to reconcile these points with closed ",
    "box passive evolution of the stellar populations of the 3cr galaxies .",
    "recognised this problem and argued that the luminous radio galaxies must be observed at a similar stage in their evolution , specifically that at which they had attained a certain stellar mass .",
    "provided that stars brought together by on  going mergers were formed at the same early epoch , the old stellar populations of galaxies formed by hierarchical clustering would appear to be passively evolving .",
    "the small scatter in the colour  magnitude relations of elliptical galaxies observed out to redshifts @xmath38 ( stanford _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 , bower _",
    "1998 ) justifies this assumption .",
    "a further objective of our analysis is to determine whether it remains true that the luminous galaxies present on the k - z relation have the same stellar mass , and how different assumptions about the underlying cosmology and the evolution of the stellar populations change this conclusion .",
    "because of the availability of the gissel codes of bruzual and charlot , the opportunity has been taken to consider a wider range of evolutionary histories of the star formation rate of radio galaxies and to couple this with an expanded range of cosmological models , in particular , those with non - zero values of the cosmological constant ( @xmath39 ) .",

    "_ 1999 ) .      the gissel codes of bruzual and charlot provide a means of modelling galaxy spectra through isochrone synthesis .",
    "the models used in the present analysis all include the passive evolution of the stellar populations of the galaxies .",
    "the standard model is taken to have solar metallicity , @xmath45 , and the stellar population of the galaxy was formed in an initial uniform starburst with a duration of 1.0 gyr .",

    "the present age of the universe , @xmath2 , is greater than 20 gyr and evolution in this model was terminated at a low redshift limit of @xmath49 .",

    "3(a ) , at optical and infrared wavelengths the spectra are roughly equally spaced logarithmically in luminosity at ages greater than @xmath50 years , indicating that , at a given wavelength , the spectral energy decreases roughly as a power - law with cosmic time .",
    "as shown by gunn ( 1978 ) , longair ( 1998 ) and others , this power - law behaviour can be understood in terms of the rate at which stars evolve from the main sequence onto the red giant branch , if the initial mass function is assumed to be of power - law form .",
    "such simple arguments predict that @xmath51 for the @xmath52 model .",
    "this is not so different from the evolution seen in fig .",
    "3(a ) , but there are important variations in the power - law index as a function of wavelength . at 0.55 @xmath53 m , the evolution can be roughly described by @xmath54 , whereas at 2.2 @xmath53 m the exponent decreases to about @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , the simple approximation is not adequate for the present analysis . for essentially all our computations , only evolution at epochs greater than @xmath50 years",
    "is required .",
    "it can be seen however that at earlier times the k - band luminosity increases with age .",
    "this is associated with the evolution of stars onto the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "the stellar evolution models of maeder and megnet ( 1989 ) and girardi _ et al . _ ( 2000 ) show that , for stars with @xmath56 , as the stellar mass decreases , the luminosity of the upper agb stars increases and their temperature decreases .",
    "thus , the simple monotonically decreasing spectral luminosity is only applicable for times greater than @xmath50 years when the turn - off mass drops below 2m@xmath29 and the agb contribution becomes less important than evolution onto the red giant branch .",
    "in previous analyses , it was assumed that the metallicity of the galaxies corresponded to solar values . the evidence of the madau plot in its various incarnations ( see , for example , madau _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) and the analyses of the metallicities of the absorption line systems in distant quasars have suggested that the chemical abundances of the elements have evolved very significantly over the redshift interval @xmath57 ( see , for example , pettini _",
    "1998 ) . to understand the effects of metallicity upon the predicted k - z relation ,",
    "models have been created for four different metallicities : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "different star formation histories have also been considered .",
    "these include a continuous exponentially decreasing star formation rate , with an e - folding time of 1 gyr , and a simple delta - function starburst .",
    "combined models could then be constructed involving multiple star formation events occurring at different cosmic times .",
    "for example , if the onset of radio source and quasar activity were contemporaneous with ( or stimulated ) an active starburst , the additional starburst component might affect the k - magnitude of the galaxy . to illustrate how such events could impact the k - z relation , model starbursts can be added to the underlying passive evolution of the majority old stellar population .",
    "two model star bursts were considered . in the first , the starburst took place instantaneously , and",
    "was observed at times @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 years after that event ; this spectral evolution is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : 3](b ) .",
    "the intriguing aspect of these spectra is that the starburst is most luminous in the infrared waveband after about @xmath63 years .",
    "after about this time the most massive stars complete their evolution on the main sequence and join the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "it is interesting that the time scale of @xmath63 years is of the same order as the typical age of the radio source events associated with the 3cr and 6c sources and so such a star burst could contribute to the k - luminosity of the galaxy . in the second example , the case of a constant star burst lasting @xmath64 years is considered , but observed at @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 years after the start of that event ; these spectra are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : 3](c ) . in this case",
    ", the star burst is expected to have a much smaller effect upon the k - luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "it can be seen that , after @xmath62 years , the starburst has the same spectrum as the first model , but with only one hundredth of the luminosity since only that fraction of the stars have formed by that time . on the other hand , after @xmath64 years , the starburst is more luminous than in the first model since there is a significant contribution of recently formed stars to the k - luminosity . in either case",
    ", it can be seen that starbursts observed between @xmath63 and @xmath64 years after the onset of the starburst can have a significant impact upon the k - luminosity of the galaxy .",
    "models have been considered in which the mass fractions of newly formed stars range between 0.5% and 5.0% of the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "+    the resulting spectral energy distributions ( seds ) were then redshifted and convolved with the transmission function of the standard k - filter .",
    "these were then combined with the different world models to create k - z diagrams .",
    "a catalogue of the range of models considered is given in tables 3 and 4 .",
    "it is simplest to illustrate the effects of changing the parameters of the cosmological models by subtracting the predicted k - z track for the chosen cosmology from the corresponding predictions of the @xmath65 , @xmath66 model : @xmath67 is defined as @xmath68 so that negative values of @xmath67 mean that a galaxy of a given absolute luminosity would be observed to have a fainter apparent magnitude .",

    "the reason for this can be understood from fig .",
    "3(a ) . by adopting 2.2 @xmath53 m as the wavelength at which the magnitude - redshift relation is determined , even at redshift @xmath92 , the changes in the luminosity of the galaxies at a rest wavelength of 500 nm are quite small and change monotonically with time",
    "indeed , the difference between observing the starburst at ages 0.32 to @xmath144 years amounts to less than a factor of three at 5000@xmath145 in the rest frame .",

    "5(a ) at redshifts of 0.5 , 1.0 and 2.0 are included in table 4 .",
    "intuitively , it would seem that the choice of hubble s constant would have a significant impact upon the form of the k - z relation since the cosmic time - scale is significantly different if , say , @xmath148 were are large as @xmath149 .",
    "then , all cosmic time - scales would be reduced by a factor of two , allowing much less time for the evolution of the stellar populations of the galaxies and also observing them at very much earlier times at large redshifts .",
    "these changes , as well as those for @xmath150 , are given in table 4 .",
    "in the cases of models with larger values for @xmath148 , an initial starburst of very short duration was adopted so that the galaxy is observed during the passive evolution phase ; the tabulated values in table 4 have included this change in star formation history .",
    "it is noteworthy that changing the value of hubble s constant has a remarkably small effect upon the predicted evolutionary tracks .",
    "the reasons for this can be understood from inspection of fig .",
    "as was emphasised in section 3.2 , so long as the analysis is restricted to redshifts less than 3 , the spectral evolution of the stellar energy distribution is monotonic with time and can be reasonably described by power - laws at different wavelengths from 0.5 to 2.2 @xmath53 m . thus ,",
    "if the value of hubble s constant is changed , the stellar mass of the galaxies required to normalise the k - z relation at low redshift is changed , but the differences in the values of @xmath151 depend primarily upon the changing _ relative _ cosmic times observed at different redshifts . in general , these are quite small and so changing the value of @xmath148 does not greatly change the evolutionary corrections . if the redshift magnitude relation were determined at rest - frame uv wavelengths , this would certainly not be the case .",
    "the metallicity of the galaxies can significantly influence their evolutionary tracks . rather than attempting to adopt some arbitrary chemical history ,",
    "the evolutionary codes have been run for metallicities of @xmath152 , @xmath153 , @xmath60 and @xmath154 .",
    "the results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : 6 ] for the same two cosmologies discussed in section 4.2 and for @xmath155 . for the einstein ",
    "de sitter cosmology , these results are also tabulated in table 4 .",
    "all four k - z tracks are normalised to the same magnitude scale as the fiducial model , rather than to the same magnitude at the present epoch .",
    "this procedure has been adopted so that at all times the variations due to changes in metallicity are clearly displayed .",
    "the sense of the changes is that , the lower the metallicity , the more luminous the galaxy at early epochs . it is apparent from fig .",
    "[ fig : 6](b ) , that assuming a lower metallicity at large redshifts improves the fit of the @xmath108 model as compared with the fiducial model .",
    "the lowest metallicity track is initially the brightest ( largest @xmath67 ) , and the @xmath154 track the faintest , but the tracks cross over at low redshift .",
    "the greatest variation between the tracks occurs at early epochs and , as we have seen from section 3.2 , it is at these young ages that the galaxies undergo the greatest amount of evolution .",
    "the early evolution of the spectral energy distribution is highly sensitive to the metallicity of the galaxy because , for a star of a given mass , changing the metallicity leads to a change in the age at which it moves from the main sequence onto the agb ; for lower values of @xmath156 the stars evolve more rapidly since there is less line blanketing and lower opacity .",
    "this has two consequences : firstly , the more rapid evolution means that lower metallicity stars were more luminous at early times ; secondly , the stars were also shorter lived and at later times there are fewer stars present in the older galaxies , which therefore appear fainter than a higher metallicity galaxy of a similar age .",
    "it is interesting that the divergence of the different metallicity tracks occurs when the universe was roughly half its present age , corresponding to the redshift at which the k - z relations for the 3cr and 6c samples begin to diverge .",
    "it is just conceivable that such an effect could account for the difference between these samples , but it would require those 6c galaxies which are less luminous than the 3cr galaxies to have higher metallicities . there is no obvious reason why greater radio luminosity should be correlated with lower metallicity of the stellar populations of the radio galaxies .    the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ fig : 6 ] can be used to construct approximate evolving galaxy models in which the metallicities of the galaxies increase with cosmic epoch .",
    "such evolution tracks can be found by changing from one locus to another as the metallicity increases .",
    "the range of models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : 6 ] illustrates how such changes would alter the predicted k - z relations .",
    "the results so far have involved an initial starburst during which the star formation rate has been assumed to be constant .",
    "it is important to consider also models in which there is ongoing star formation , and in particular those in which the occurrence of a radio source event might be associated with a major star formation event in the host galaxy .",
    "this could occur if , for example , the central black hole were fuelled following some form of galaxy merger . to understand the significance of these results , we need to look more closely at the origin of the k - band flux density .",
    "the k - band luminosity of evolving galaxies arises from two stellar populations .",
    "stars with mass m@xmath1572m@xmath29 evolve beyond core and shell helium burning to become asymptotic giant stars ; those with m@xmath1582m@xmath29 become red giant stars forming the old red giant branch seen , for example , in globular clusters .",
    "for the present study , we are mainly interested in the evolution of the overall stellar population of the galaxies over cosmic time - scales greater than @xmath50years .",
    "this age corresponds to the main sequence lifetime of a star of mass 2@xmath159 .",
    "therefore , at ages greater than @xmath50years , the evolution is dominated by stars evolving onto the standard red giant branch and the arguments given in section 3.2 can account for the decreasing luminosity of the galaxy . on the other hand ,",
    "if there are epochs of rapid star formation , the bulk of the near - infrared luminosity is associated with stars on the asymptotic giant branch . for the most luminous stars ,",
    "evolution onto the asymptotic giant branch takes place after a few times @xmath62years .",
    "figure  [ fig : 3](b ) shows dramatically the large increase in k - luminosity of an instantaneous starburst when it is about @xmath63years old associated with the formation of agb stars . on the other hand , if the starburst is of longer duration , say @xmath64years as illustrated in figure  [ fig : 3](c ) , the effect is somewhat diluted by the continued formation of all types of massive stars .    considering first variations in the long - term star formation history of the galaxy populations , fig .",
    "[ fig : 7 ] displays three different types of star formation history : ( i ) the standard 1-gyr starburst , ( ii ) an instantaneous starburst of negligibly short duration , and ( iii ) a model in which the star formation rate decays exponentially with an e - folding time of @xmath50 years .",
    "there is very little difference between the three models , all three of which have been normalised to the same stellar mass at late cosmic times .",
    "the brightest model ( largest @xmath67 ) except at the very earliest times is the exponential star formation model , and the faintest the instantaneous burst model .",
    "these results are not surprising since , it is only the behaviour after @xmath50years which is relevant to the k - z relation for @xmath160 .",
    "once star formation ceases , the continued star formation of the exponential model , and sustained production of agb stars ( albeit in small numbers ) , is sufficient to make this model the brightest track at low redshift .",
    "the most evolved model , the instantaneous starburst , has the lowest luminosity at low redshift .",
    "these differences between the models are very small , as can be seen from the values given in table 4 .",
    "[ fig : 8 ] shows the standard model coupled with the seds of instantaneous starbursts at three different ages ( @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 years old ) , the additional starburst accounting for 2.5% of the total stellar mass of the galaxy .",
    "the model with the additional burst occurring the longest time before observations , @xmath64 years , gives the least change from the predictions of the underlying model .",
    "similarly , the @xmath62 year old recent burst also results in only a slight difference at low redshift . in the first case ,",
    "the additional young ( @xmath64 years old ) high mass stars have evolved beyond the agb , and in the second case ( @xmath62 years old ) they have not yet had enough time for their evolution to reach that stage .",
    "[ fig : 3 ] shows that the rest frame k - band flux of an evolved instantaneous burst at these ages is much closer to that for the underlying star formation model than the @xmath63 year old track . at high redshift , however , we need to consider a somewhat bluer rest - frame wavelength region . whilst there is a small difference for the @xmath64 year old model ,",
    "the @xmath62 year old recent burst is slightly brighter still , which is seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : 8 ] .",
    "the model with the @xmath63 year old recent burst component shows the greatest change from the standard model , as expected from fig .",
    "[ fig : 3 ] .",
    "the @xmath67 values for these models given in table 4 are solely due to the additional recent burst component .",
    "the additional burst consistently brightens the k - z tracks at late times .",
    "the reason for the effect being most pronounced at small redshifts is that the luminosity of the starburst is assumed to be independent of redshift . since the k - luminosity increases in roughly power - law fashion with increasing redshift , the luminosity of the starburst is soon swamped by the majority population of red giant branch stars .",
    "[ fig : 9 ] displays the results for the same set of models as in fig .",
    "[ fig : 8 ] , but the mass fraction of the additional starburst is varied rather than its age .",
    "the tracks in this figure involve an additional @xmath63 year starburst and four mass fractions .",
    "if the mass of the starburst as a function of redshift remains constant , the overall shape of the k - z relation is flattened at late times and does not result in an improved fit to the observational data .",
    "some scatter may be introduced into the k - z relation , because the radio galaxies are observed at a range of ages from @xmath62 to @xmath64 years . in order for starbursts to change significantly the shapes of the k - z relations , the additional starburst mass would need to change with redshift .",
    "this is quite possible , as there is more gas available in any merger - induced starburst at high redshift .",
    "the same would be true if the starburst were radio jet induced ( e.g. rees 1989 ) , which provides a possible explanation of the alignment effect ( mccarthy _ et al .",
    "_ 1987 , chambers _",
    "1987 ) . figs .",
    "[ fig : 8 ] and 9 can be used to estimate how significantly the k - band luminosity could have changed if the magnitude of the starburst were to vary with cosmic epoch . just as in the case of evolving metallicity , so in the case of evolving starbursts ,",
    "the evolutionary history can be estimated by moving from one track to another in figs .",
    "[ fig : 8 ] and 9 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : 9 ] , if the early starbursts involved 5% of the galaxy mass , the evolutionary track would begin on the dotted line ; if this subsequently decreased to 2.5% and 1% , the track would change to the dot - dashed and dashed lines respectively .",
    "a 5% starburst by mass is the absolute maximum allowable given the constraints of the observed ultraviolet luminosities for the 3cr radio galaxies at @xmath38 ( e.g. best _ et al .",
    "_ 1998 ) . in this extreme case",
    "the magnitude increase in k is at most about 0.5 magnitudes .",
    "the above analyses of the k - z relations for a wide range of plausible cosmological models have established a number of useful general rules concerning the potential use of the luminosities of massive galaxies as standard candles .",
    "the value of carrying out these studies in the k - waveband at 2.2@xmath53 m for redshifts @xmath161 is clearly illustrated by the synthesised spectral energy distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : 3](a ) in which it can be seen that the evolution of the dominant stellar populations can be predicted with some confidence . as has been discussed by previous authors ,",
    "the dominant evolutionary trends are associated with the evolution of stars in the mass range 1  2 @xmath162 from the main sequence onto the red giant branch .",
    "an equally important result is that , over this range of redshifts , the choice of cosmological model is much more important than the corrections associated the evolution of the stellar populations of the galaxies , as is vividly illustrated by the values in table 2 .",
    "thus , provided standard galaxies can be identified over the redshift range @xmath163 , there are good prospects for obtaining useful information about the choice of cosmological model .",
    "the problem with this programme is the identification of such a class of standard galaxy , particularly in the light of the favoured picture of hierarchical clustering to account for the formation of structures such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies over the same redshift interval .",
    "the analysis of best _ et al . _",
    "( 1998 ) showed that the 3cr radio galaxies seemed to form a population of galaxies of constant mass within the framework of the @xmath164 world model , although they described a number of reasons why this was a somewhat surprising result .",
    "the present calculations have extended that analysis to a much wider range of cosmological models and considered in more detail the effects of the evolution of the stellar populations of the galaxies .",
    "the results shown in fig .  [ fig : 4 ] and documented in table 2 show that all the new models are a significantly poorer fit to the large redshift data . in particular , the principal cause of the poorer fits is the choice of cosmological model . expressed in physical terms , in the critical @xmath102 model , galaxies at a given redshift",
    "are observed at significantly smaller distance measures than in all the other models considered and so have the brightest k - magnitudes . in all the other models considered , a literal interpretation of the results would be that the radio galaxies at redshifts @xmath32 have greater stellar masses than the radio galaxies nearby . the analysis has shown that this result is independent of the choice of hubble s constant .",
    "it is of particular interest to find ways in which the favoured flat cosmological model with @xmath165 can be reconciled with the observational data .",
    "as the results in table  4 indicate , to produce an improved fit to the observational data one or more of the following changes to the standard evolution picture must be introduced :    1 .   a lower redshift of star formation , @xmath166 , provides a much improved fit to the observed k - z relation for this cosmological model ( fig .",
    "[ fig : 5]b ) .",
    "a problem with this improved fit is that the galaxies would then be expected to be very much more luminous in optical wavebands with significant evidence for younger stellar populations , whilst the red colours of distant radio galaxies suggest a much larger luminosity  weighted stellar age ( e.g. cf dunlop _",
    "et al . _ , 1996 ) .",
    "further , the observation of well  formed galaxies which are powerful radio sources out to redshift @xmath167 ( van breugel _ et al . _ , 1999 ) indicates that at least some of these galaxies formed at higher redshifts .",
    "the metallicities of the galaxies may have been significantly less at redshifts @xmath168 than they are at the present epoch . as shown in fig .",
    "6(b ) , decreasing the metallicity of the galaxy to only about 20% of the present cosmic value improves significantly the fit of the model to the observations .",
    "starbursts associated with the radio source events can lead to a significant enhancement of the k - band luminosities of the galaxies , due to the rapid evolution of luminous massive stars onto the asymptotic giant branch .",
    "this could potentially improve the fit of the models in lambda cosmologies if associated starbursts brighten the distant galaxies , but not those at redshifts less than 1 .",
    "this is quite plausible since such starbursts could be enhanced at high redshifts due to the extra gas available at these epochs for forming stars , either in a galaxy merger or triggered by the radio jet ; indeed additional blue luminoisity is observed in powerful radio galaxies at high redshifts ( the alignment effect ) .",
    "there is clearly much scope for arbitrarily adjusting the masses , timescales and cosmic evolution of the starbursts to improve the fit to the k  band data .",
    "however , the excess blue luminosity associated with the alignment effect requires only a few @xmath169 of newly formed stars",
    "( @xmath170% of the galaxy mass ) , even were it all to be associated with star formation activity ( e.g. dunlop _ et al .",
    "_ 1989 ; best _ et al . _ , 1998 ) : this sets a strong constraint upon the luminosities and durations of the bursts .",
    "the alternative approach is to accept that , even after accounting for stellar evolution , the radio galaxies at @xmath171 may indeed be more luminous , that is , have a greater stellar mass , than those at small redshifts .",
    "this conclusion would mean that the low and high redshift radio galaxies would not form a single evolving population , and would be surprising in terms of hierarchical clustering scenarios according to which such massive galaxies at high redshift are extremely rare . given the growing evidence that the distant radio galaxies belong to cluster environments",
    ", it may be plausible that they had undergone more mergers than the nearby radio galaxies , which are found in more rarified environments : this possibility could be tested by carrying out cross - correlation analyses of radio galaxies of different k - luminosities with field galaxies , although this becomes a demanding project for the radio galaxies at @xmath171 .",
    "the similar characteristic sizes of the 3cr radio galaxies at redshifts 1 and 0 , however , sets constraints upon the intrinsic differences in luminosities which effectively rule out the most extreme cosmological models , those with @xmath172 .",
