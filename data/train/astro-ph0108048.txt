    "<S> we have measured the resonance strengths and energies for dielectronic recombination ( dr ) of forming via @xmath0 ( @xmath1 ) core excitations . we have also calculated the dr resonance strengths and energies using autostructure , hullac , mcdf , and r - matrix methods , four different state - of - the - art theoretical techniques . on average the theoretical resonance strengths agree to within @xmath2 with experiment . </S>",
    "<S> the autostructure , mcdf and r - matrix results are in better agreement with experiment than are the hullac results . however , in all cases the @xmath3 standard deviation for the ratios of the theoretical - to - experimental resonance strengths is @xmath4 which is significantly larger than the estimated relative experimental uncertainty of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that similar errors exist in the calculated level populations and line emission spectrum of the recombined ion . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that theoretical methods based on inverse - photoionization calculations ( e.g. , undamped r - matrix methods ) will severely overestimate the strength of the dr process unless they include the effects of radiation damping . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the coupling between the dr and radiative recombination ( rr ) channels is small .    </S>",
    "<S> below 2  ev the theoretical resonance energies can be up to @xmath5 larger than experiment . </S>",
    "<S> this is larger than the estimated uncertainty in the experimental energy scale ( @xmath6 below @xmath7  ev and @xmath8 for higher energies ) and is attributed to uncertainties in the calculations . </S>",
    "<S> these discrepancies makes dr of an excellent case for testing atomic structure calculations of ions with partially filled shells . above 2  </S>",
    "<S> ev , agreement between theory and experiment improves dramatically with the autostructure and mcdf results falling within 2% of experiment , the r - matrix results within 3% , and hullac within 5% . </S>",
    "<S> agreement for all four calculations improves as the resonance energy increases .    </S>",

    "<S> , low - density photoionized plasma with cosmic abundances , the experimental and theoretical results agree to better than @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> this is within the total estimated experimental uncertainty limits of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> agreement below @xmath12  ev is difficult to quantify due to current theoretical and experimental limitations . </S>",
    "<S> agreement with previously published @xmath13-coupling rate coefficients is poor , particularly for @xmath14  ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is attributed to errors in the resonance energies of these calculations as well as the omission of dr via @xmath15 core excitations . </S>",
    "<S> we have also used our r - matrix results , topped off using autostructure for rr into @xmath16 levels , to calculate the rate coefficient for rr of . </S>",
    "<S> our rr results are in good agreement with previously published calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for temperatures as low as @xmath17  ev , dr still dominates over rr for this system . </S>"
