    "the 2005 atlantic hurricane season is famous as the most active and expensive atlantic hurricane season since records began .",
    "in addition to thousands of deaths , damage to property and infrastructure was estimated to have amounted to 130 billion usd .",
    "the mexican states of quintana roo and yucatn and the u.s .",
    "states of florida and louisiana were each struck twice by large hurricanes . these included katrina , the most expensive natural disaster in the history of the united states .",
    "the insurance industry is naturally interested in the question of whether this is mere coincidence or whether there are correlations between the tracks of intense hurricanes .",
    "risk estimation models used in the industry often treat the probability of hurricanes making landfall in a particular area as independent poisson processes characterised by their historical mean",
    ". the possibility of even weak correlations , particularly between large storms , may be an important source of systematic error in these models .",
    "this question was posed by lloyds and explored during the 73rd european study group with industry which took place at warwick in april 2010 @xcite .",
    "statistical analysis of the historical data was done which did not prove conclusive . in tandem with this statistical analysis a more basic fluid dynamics question",
    "was studied : how do the pairs of vortices embedded in a larger scale `` steering flow '' influence each other when their separations are large ?",
    "our work will build on the basic theories of oceanic - scale atmospheric flows described in @xcite and the theories of hurricane dynamics proposed in @xcite .",
    "we will rely heavily on the atmospheric vortex dynamics model proposed in @xcite and the observational studies reported in @xcite .",
    "the most elementary theory of 2-d vortex dynamics concerns the flow that results when vortices of strengths @xmath0 at @xmath1 , @xmath2 , move in a background potential flow , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a prescribed streamfunction .",
    "the theory asserts that the streamfunction is @xmath5 where @xmath6 , and that the @xmath7 evolve according to the hamiltonian system : @xmath8 eq .",
    "( [ eq - streamfunctioneuler ] ) ensures that the flow is potential flow away from the vortices and eq .",
    "( [ eq-2deuler ] ) is the helmholtz condition that each vortex moves with the velocity that would have existed in its absence .",
    "this condition can be justified by smearing the vorticity into small patches ( see @xcite for the use of this idea to model hurricanes ) around @xmath9 and considering the momentum balance for these patches , which reveals that no relative velocity can exist between the patch and its ambient free stream .",
    "a very crude model for the `` follow - my - leader '' problem is to consider the motion of two equal vortices placed in a steering flow comprising of a uniform potential flow impinging upon a solid wall ( see fig .",
    "[ fig - deflectioneuler](a ) ) .",
    "the flow in the upper right quadrant may be thought of as representing the atlantic anticyclone and the wall as representing a blocking pattern in the gulf of mexico .",
    "we took @xmath10 the streamlines of the large scale steering flow are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - deflectioneuler ] .",
    "the only interesting feature is that the flow has a hyperbolic point at @xmath11 . with @xmath12 the point vortices simply follow the streamlines shown in fig .",
    "[ fig - deflectioneuler](a ) .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     fig .",
    "[ fig - deflection ] shows the results of a numerical experiment designed to quantify the effects of vortices on each other .",
    "the parameters used are as in table [ tab - parameters ] and the axes have been re - expressed in physical units for ease of interpretation .",
    "we used two different background flows , a uniform current flowing to the left ( west ) ( open circles ) and separating background flow corresponding to an inertial boundary current ( solid circles ) .",
    "a single point vortex simply follows the streamlines of the background flow as it would have done in the classical theory of potential flows . in order to quantify the influence of other vortices on this trajectory we started a vortex off at a chosen point in space and then inserted a second vortex at the same point after a given time delay of @xmath13 .",
    "we then compared the position of the first vortex at a later time , @xmath14 days , with the position it would have been at had the second vortex not been inserted .",
    "the follow - my - leader effect can then be quantified by plotting this deflection of the first vortex from its unperturbed path as a function of the time delay between the vortices .",
    "clearly , for large delays , the deflection should be smaller as the time delay increases .",
    "for the case of a uniform background flow , it decreases exponentially as the delay increases .",
    "we see that for a delay of 7 days , typical for atlantic hurricanes , the deflection is about 10 km .",
    "since this is less than the core radius of our vortices , below which our model can not be considered meaningful , this means that there is effectively no interaction between the vortices for such separations . of course , much stronger deflections of the order of hundreds of km can be observed for vortices separated by 2 days or less which is reflecting the well - known fact that vortices interact very strongly when they get close to each other .    for the separating background flow ,",
    "the typical deflection is orders of magnitude larger even though all model parameters remain the same .",
    "the reason is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig - tracks ] which illustrate the tracks followed by the two vortices for different values of the delay .",
    "one sees that the second vortex can easily deflect the first one onto a track which subsequently diverges from the initial track due to the presence of the stagnation point in the flow .",
    "we have used a quasi - geostrophic model together with a physically plausible law of vortex dynamics to model hurricane tracks in the presence of an ocean - scale steering flow .",
    "our model has enabled us to quantify the sensitivity of the `` follow - my - leader '' phenomenon to the presence of stagnation points in the steering flow .",
    "it would be of interest in the future to compare the predictions of our simulation with the probabilistic models that are used in risk estimation ."
