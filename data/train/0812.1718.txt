    "molecular gas provides the fuel for star formation and therefore plays an important role in both the current appearance and future evolution of galaxies .",
    "early surveys for molecular gas in galaxies revealed a wide range in total gas content , from the rarely detected elliptical galaxies to gas - rich massive spirals such as m51 @xcite .",
    "for spiral galaxies , the variations in gas content roughly track the star formation rate for different systems , such that the global star formation efficiency ( the inverse of which is the gas depletion time , @xmath5 ) does not depend strongly on morphology when far - infrared luminosity is used to trace the star formation rate @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of individual galaxies provided evidence for enhanced star formation efficiencies ( implying shorter instantaneous gas depletion times ) at certain positions within spiral arms @xcite or along them @xcite compared to the disk - averaged value .",
    "a focused survey of spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster showed that the molecular gas content of hi - deficient cluster spirals is similar to that of their more gas - rich counterparts @xcite .",
    "@xcite find that the star formation rate surface density correlates with the molecular but not the atomic gas surface density .    to date",
    ", most large surveys of molecular gas in galaxies have been carried out using the co @xmath0=1 - 0 transition ; this line is sensitive to the vast majority of molecular gas in the cold interstellar medium in galaxies , since the @xmath0=1 level is only 5.5 k above the ground state and the @xmath0=1 - 0 transition has a critical density of @xmath6 @xmath7 in optically thin gas .",
    "the detailed connection between co emission and molecular gas mass and ultimately the star formation process depends rather critically on the value of the co - to - h@xmath8 conversion factor @xcite and any dependencies of that conversion factor on temperature , density , or metallicity @xcite .",
    "while individual galaxies have been studied in higher transitions , primarily co @xmath0=2 - 1 and co @xmath0=3 - 2 , the only large surveys available to date in the co @xmath0=3 - 2 transition are observations of the central regions of galaxies @xcite .",
    "since the co @xmath0=3 level is 33 k above the ground state and the @xmath0=3 - 2 transition has a critical density of @xmath9 @xmath7 in optically thin gas , the @xmath0=3 - 2 transition naturally traces gas that is on average warmer and/or denser than the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line .",
    "examining the co @xmath0=3 - 2/1 - 0 line ratio both within and between galaxies can give information on any large - scale variations in the physical conditions in the molecular gas @xcite .",
    "in addition , the co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission may trace the molecular gas that is more directly connected with star formation ; indeed , @xcite have found that the global co @xmath0=3 - 2 luminosity correlates nearly linearly with the global star formation rate over five orders of magnitude .",
    "@xcite also find a nearly linear relation between the h@xmath8 surface density traced by the co @xmath0=2 - 1 line and the star formation rate surface density .",
    "these relations are similar to the linear correlation of hcn with far - infrared luminosity seen by @xcite and suggests that these co transitions may also be effective tracers of the densest , star forming gas .",
    "in contrast , the co @xmath0=1 - 0 luminosity has a much shallower correlation with star formation rate with a slope @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "this shallower slope implies that there is not a one - to - one relation between the amount of molecular gas ( as traced by the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line ) and the amount of star formation in a galaxy . the shallower slope compared to the co",
    "j=3 - 2 data also indicates that the two lines are not tracing exactly the same gas components .",
    "for example , the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line can include emission from lower opacity , more diffuse molecular gas @xcite .",
    "examining the correlation between molecular gas and star formation rate as a function of the gas density may yield new insights into the star formation process in galaxies .",
    "an ideal laboratory for the acquisition of resolved molecular maps in galaxies is the nearby virgo cluster . at a distance of 16.7 mpc @xcite , it is the largest concentration of galaxies ( cluster mass @xmath11 m@xmath4 ; * ? ? ?",

    "high - resolution hi observations with the vla have identified seven spiral galaxies with long hi tails pointing away from m87 @xcite , which suggests that interaction with the cluster as a whole has created these tails .",
    "other evidence for environmental modification includes ram - pressure stripped extraplanar gas tails and disturbances in radio morphologies @xcite .",

    "four large spiral galaxies ( , , , and ) are the only virgo cluster galaxies included in the sings survey @xcite and there is a large collection of information on their dust and interstellar medium properties . some basic properties of the galaxies are given in table  [ tbl - props ] .",
    "the global 1 - 850 @xmath1 m spectral energy distributions ( seds ) for these four galaxies are very similar @xcite , although the @xmath2 parameter in the sed fit ranges from a high 3.8 in ngc 4579 to a low of 2.4 in ngc 4254 .",
    "@xcite calculate the dust mass and gas to dust ratio for 65 galaxies in the sings sample .",
    "of the four virgo spirals discussed in our paper , only ngc 4579 stands out as having a factor of 3 larger gas to dust ratio ; this is the second highest gas to dust ratio in the entire sample analyzed by @xcite .",
    "this high gas - to - dust ratio may be a by - product of the difficulty in determining the 850 @xmath1 m flux from the relatively low signal - to - noise scuba map ( bendo , private communication ) .",
    "morphologically , of the four virgo spirals , ngc 4569 is the most centrally concentrated at 24 @xmath1 m , while ngc 4254 is both the least centrally concentrated and the most asymmetric @xcite . the star formation distribution based on h@xmath2 emission is classified as normal for ngc 4254 but truncated / normal for the other three galaxies @xcite .",
    "below we give some important details on each of the individual galaxies .",
    "recent hi observations of ngc4254 ( m99 ) show a long tidal tail extending to the north ; its lopsided morphology , high hi content , and high relative velocity suggest that this galaxy is undergoing its first encounter with the center of the virgo cluster @xcite .",

    "it also has a rather prominent circumnuclear ring with much enhanced star formation @xcite .",
    "ngc 4569 ( m90 ) has been called an anemic spiral because of the small extent of its hi emission relative to its optical size @xcite , although @xcite prefer a designation of truncated / normal because its star formation rate per unit area is relatively normal .",
    "@xcite note that there is almost no 24 @xmath1 m emission from the extended disk .",
    "the co @xmath0=1 - 0 emission shows a compact bar oriented roughly north - south @xcite with complex kinematics indicating non - circular motions in the central arcminute @xcite .",
    "this galaxy has a higher molecular gas to total gas fraction than ngc 4254 , perhaps due to ram pressure stripping of hi even within the stellar disk or a higher external pressure due to the intracluster medium @xcite .",
    "however , the fact that the only remaining gas is in the inner disk , which tends to have a high molecular gas fraction , could also explain this result .",
    "@xcite find that the galaxy has some hii regions that appear to be outside the plane .",
    "they also note that rotation plus forward motion relative to the icm can create an asymmetric ram pressure , which in simulations can produce a dominant extraplanar gas arm emerging from a truncated gas disk .",
    "@xcite present also evidence for ram pressure stripping by comparing the kinematically distinct western arm with dynamical simulations .",
    "@xcite argue that active gas stripping , rather than simply stopping gas inflow , is required to explain the star formation history in ngc 4569 .",
    "@xcite suggest that ngc 4569 is in the early stages of bar or tidally driven gas inflow .",
    "ngc 4579 ( m58 ) is classified as liner 1.9/seyfert 1.9 @xcite .",
    "high resolution co @xmath0=2 - 1 observations show two spiral arms approaching to within a few arcseconds of the agn @xcite and weak co emission at the agn itself @xcite . at lower resolution ,",
    "weak co emission is detected throughout the disk @xcite . despite the weak emission ,",
    "this galaxy has a higher molecular gas to total gas fraction than ngc 4254 , and so may also have been affected by ram pressure stripping or a higher external pressure @xcite .    in summary",
    ", this small sample of four spiral galaxies probes a large fraction of the characteristics seen for luminous spirals in the virgo cluster such as hi deficiency , star formation rate , and presence of nuclear activity .",
    "thus , a detailed study of the molecular gas and star formation properties of these galaxies should provide insight into the effects on the ism in galaxies and galaxy structure and evolution that can be addressed using the complete virgo sample from the ngls .",

    "details of the reduction of the co @xmath0=3 - 2 data are given in @xcite and so we give only a brief summary here .",
    "the individual raw data files were flagged to remove data from any of the 16 individual receptors with bad baselines and then the scans were combined into a data cube using a @xmath19 kernel as the weighting function to determine the contribution of individual receptors to each pixel in the final map .",
    "a mask was created to identify line - free regions of the data cube and a third - order baseline was fit to those line - free regions .",

    "the image for ngc 4579 did not include any single dish ( short - spacing ) data @xcite and so must be considered a lower limit to the total co @xmath0=1 - 0 intensity .",
    "each image was convolved with the appropriate two - dimensional gaussian to give a smoothed image with a 14.5@xmath15 circular gaussian beam to match the jcmt resolution and converted from jy beam@xmath17 km s@xmath17 to k km s@xmath17 using a conversion factor of 0.438 k jy@xmath17 .",

    "second , asteroids have been identified and removed from the data .",
    "third , the updated flux calibration terms given by @xcite have been applied to the data . to compare the 24 @xmath1 m images to the jcmt data",
    ", we convolved the 24 @xmath1 m images with special convolution kernels that match the profiles of the psf to the 14.5@xmath15 gaussian function that describes the jcmt beam .",

    "the h@xmath2 images were downloaded from the sings website @xcite ; there was no image for ngc 4569 , so we used the image from the gold mine database @xcite . although the images were background subtracted , a weakly varying background across the image affected the flux levels once the images were convolved to match the jcmt resolution .",
    "we therefore binned the image by 100 pixels and clipped any data above 2 sigma to remove real emission , and then fit a two - dimensional first - order polynomial to the resulting image .",
    "the data were calibrated as described in the sings release notes .",
    "the images were corrected for contamination by the two [ nii ] lines using the [ nii]/h@xmath2 ratios from @xcite . finally , we convolved the images with a 14.5@xmath15 gaussian to match the resolution of the jcmt .",
    "all ancillary data images were aligned with jcmt image orientation and pixel size using the kappa command wcsalign .",
    "we calculated an image of the star formation rate surface density for each galaxy by combining the h@xmath2 and 24 @xmath1 m images using the formula in @xcite .",
    "maps of the star formation rate for each galaxy are given in figure  [ fig - sfr ] .",
    "for ngc 4579 , the central agn dominates the emission at both h@xmath2 and 24 @xmath1 m .",

    "all calibrations to date of the conversion from co luminosity to molecular gas mass have been for the ground state @xmath0=1 - 0 transition @xcite .",

    "assuming a 15% absolute calibration uncertainty for both co data sets (  2 ) , the mean line ratios in the three galaxies with good co @xmath0=3 - 2 detections agree at the 1 sigma level .",
    "however , the southern half of ngc 4569 has a significantly lower line ratio while the central region of ngc 4321 and the northern emission peak of ngc 4569 have significantly higher line ratios .",
    "these line ratios suggest that the gas may be on average somewhat warmer and/or denser in the center of ngc 4321 and north of ngc 4569 , while the southern disk of ngc 4569 may be somewhat cooler or less dense than typical disk regions .",

    "however , for ngc 4569 , the co @xmath0=1 - 0 mass is almost a factor of three times larger than the co @xmath0=3 - 2 mass .",
    "this larger mass is partly a result of the fact that the co @xmath0=3 - 2/@xmath0=1 - 0 ratio in this galaxy is the lowest of the three ( accounting for a factor of 1.4 in mass ) and also that the southern region of the galaxy is quite bright in co @xmath0=1 - 0 but almost invisible in co @xmath0=3 - 2 . for ngc 4579 , the co @xmath0=1 - 0 mass is a factor of ten larger than the upper limit to the co @xmath0=3 - 2 mass , again consistent with the very weak co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission in this galaxy as a whole .",

    "the most straightforward interpretation is that the gas mass calculated from the co @xmath0=3 - 2 luminosity using a co @xmath0=3 - 2/@xmath0=1 - 0 line ratio of 0.6 ( as seen in galactic gmcs ) traces the dense molecular gas , while the mass calculated directly from the co @xmath0=1 - 0 luminosity traces the total molecular gas mass . with this interpretation ,",
    "the dense gas fraction in the galaxies in our sample is 46% for ngc 4254 , 65% for ngc 4321 , 22% for ngc 4569 , and @xmath317% for ngc 4579 .",
    "however , this simple picture is muddied by the disagreement between the co @xmath0=1 - 0 data of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "although the total fluxes in the published co @xmath0=1 - 0 integrated intensity images for ngc 4321 and ngc 4569 are very similar , the _ total _ mass from the single - dish maps of @xcite is a factor of 2 larger in ngc 4321 and a factor of 0.8 smaller in ngc 4569 , such that the dense gas fraction in the two galaxies becomes quite similar if we use the masses from @xcite .",
    "while some of these variations may be attributed to such factors as calibration uncertainties ( to explain ngc 4569 ) and larger mapping area ( for ngc 4321 ) , the fact remains that considerable uncertainties , perhaps as large as a factor of two , continue to plague these gas mass estimates .",
    "the instantaneous gas depletion time ( @xmath32 ) can be calculated as the ratio of the molecular gas mass divided by the star formation rate . the inverse of the gas depletion time is often referred to as the star formation efficiency @xcite . in this section , we examine the gas depletion times both within and between the galaxies in our sample .",
    "we focus first on the gas depletion time calculated assuming a co @xmath0=3 - 2/@xmath0=1 - 0 ratio of 0.6 , which is essentially a depletion time for the dense gas . in the next section ,",
    "we compare these gas depletion times to values obtained using the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line .",
    "note that the _ instantaneous _ gas depletion time ( or star formation efficiency ) traces the rate at which currently available molecular gas is being turned into stars , and will give ( often substantially ) shorter times than global gas depletion times calculated from the total gas reservoir ( molecular plus atomic gas ) . in the calculations of gas depletion time ,",
    "we include a factor of 1.36 to take into account the mass contribution of helium .",
    "we made maps of @xmath32 for ngc4254 , ngc 4321 , and ngc 4569 by combining the star formation rate maps described in  2 with co @xmath0=3 - 2 integrated intensity maps containing only pixels detected at the 3@xmath26 level or above .",
    "we assume a co line ratio of 0.6 and adopt a co to h@xmath8 conversion factor of @xmath27 @xmath28 ( k km s@xmath17)@xmath17 @xcite",
    ". maps of the gas depletion time are given in figure  [ fig - tgas ] , where the units of @xmath32 are gyr .",
    "global and central values for the gas depletion times as well as values for emission peaks within the disk are given in table  [ tbl - tgas ] .",
    "for ngc 4254 , the average value of @xmath32 is 1.1 gyr . for ngc 4321 , the average value of @xmath32 is 1.7 gyr , while for ngc 4569 it is 1.6 gyr , both values 50% larger than the gas depletion time for ngc 4254 .",
    "the gas depletion times show the most variation in ngc 4569 , but are still quite uniform across the disk .",
    "the value in the central region ( 0.9 gyr ) is about half the average value in the disk .",
    "the value measured at the peak of the co emission in the southern half of the galaxy is somewhat lower still at 0.6 gyr , while the value at the northern co peak is closer to the disk mean value at 1.2 gyr .",
    "note that the weak co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission in the southern half of the galaxy is balanced by the lower star formation rate to give a similar gas depletion time . for ngc 4579",
    ", the nominal gas depletion time for the one pixel to the west of the nucleus where the weak co emission aligns with a region of star formation is 0.25 gyr , a factor of four smaller than the average gas depletion time in ngc 4254 and a factor of six smaller than the gas depletion times for ngc 4321 and ngc4569 .",
    "because of the strong agn in ngc 4579 ( see  [ sec - discuss ] ) , we can not obtain a reliable estimate of the gas depletion time in the nucleus from our analysis .",
    "thus , of the three galaxies in our sample with strong co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission , ngc 4254 , which has a normal hi content for its type , has a smaller gas depletion time by a factor of 1.5 compared to ngc 4321 and ngc 4569 .",
    "these two galaxies have very similar instantaneous depletion times for the dense gas , despite having a factor of three difference in their hi deficiency ( table  [ tbl - props ] ) .",
    "the gas depletion times in these three galaxies comparable to or somewhat smaller than the values of @xmath33 yr obtained in spiral galaxies by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "overall , the gas depletion times calculated here are significantly smaller than a hubble time .",
    "one reason is that we are calculating an instantaneous gas depletion time by focusing just on the dense molecular component rather than including the entire gas reservoir ( atomic plus all phases of molecular gas at all radii ) .",
    "radial infall of gas from the outer atomic disks can provide new fuel for star formation ; however , this process is likely to be less effective in cluster galaxies where the outer disk has been removed @xcite .",
    "another reason that these numbers should not be taken as evidence that these virgo spirals will imminently `` run out '' of gas to fuel star formation is that we have not attempted to include the effect of return of material to the ism via supernovae , stellar winds , and stellar evolution .",
    "these gas depletion times provide a useful snapshot of the current rate at which gas is being turned into stars , in the same way that the h@xmath2 and 24 @xmath1 m emission captures the formation of massive ( @xmath34 m@xmath4 ) stars over the last 10 - 20 myr .",
    "how do the variations in the gas and star formation properties of these four galaxies relate to their internal structure and larger environment ?",
    "ngc 4254 has been suggested to be on its first encounter with the central regions of the cluster and , indeed , has a normal ratio of molecular to atomic gas and a normal extent of star formation .",
    "it is also the only galaxy in our sample that does not show evidence of a bar @xcite .",
    "its smaller gas depletion time translates into a higher current star formation efficiency ; this higher efficiency may be due to the fact that the galaxy has only begun to be disturbed by the cluster ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "ngc 4321 is classified as weakly barred ( sab(s)bc , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; high resolution co @xmath0=1 - 0 observations show two spiral arms and gas in the nucleus as well as faint emission bridging the arms and the nucleus @xcite .",
    "there is also a prominent circumnuclear ring with enhanced star formation @xcite .",
    "thus , the similar gas depletion times calculated for the central region and the spiral arms suggests that increased star formation is balanced by an increased molecular gas content in these regions . for ngc 4569",
    ", the somewhat lower co @xmath0=3 - 2/@xmath0=1 - 0 ratio of 0.25 suggests that the average gas in ngc 4569 may be somewhat cooler and/or less dense than the gas in ngc 4254 or 4321 .",
    "however , this potential difference in average gas properties does not seem to have a strong effect on the gas depletion time ( or star formation efficiency ) estimated using the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line .",
    "given the nearly edge - on orientation of ngc 4569 , it is possible that the contribution from co @xmath0=1 - 0 emission in the outer disk of the galaxy contributes significantly to the measured line ratio , while the co @xmath0=3 - 2 is confined to the inner disk regions along with the star formation .",
    "ngc 4569 is the largest of the virgo spirals in our sample , yet its co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission is the most compact .",
    "this morphology suggests that whatever processes are acting to strip the outer portions of the galaxy of gas are also affecting the distribution of the dense molecular gas , perhaps by stripping it directly or by removing the reservoir ( atomic hydrogen or diffuse molecular hydrogen ) from which it forms .",
    "the southern portion of the galaxy contains much less dense molecular gas and star formation than the northern half .",
    "given the geometry of the galaxy @xcite , the northern portion seems likely to be more affected by interaction with the igm as its rotational motion and motion through the cluster are in the same sense .",
    "the higher density or warmer gas in the northern half of ngc 4569 could possibly be due to gas compression in this region where ram pressure is active .",
    "ngc 4579 appears to be the most unusual galaxy of our small sample .",
    "its disk has the smallest gas depletion time ( highest star formation efficiency ) of any of the four galaxies in our sample .",
    "the relatively weaker star formation in this galaxy as well as its more limited spatial extent ( figure  [ fig - sfr ] ) suggests a galaxy which may be exhausting its fuel for star formation .",
    "its relatively early morphological type ( sab(rs)ab , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) is consistent with this picture , although ngc 4569 has an identical classification .",
    "however , the higher inclination of ngc 4569 means that a given surface density of molecular gas is more easily detected than in ngc 4579 .",
    "indeed , the relatively weak co j=3 - 2 emission in the southern half of ngc 4569 would be undetectable if it were at the same inclination as ngc 4579 .",
    "in addition , the broader lines ( full - width zero intensity 400 - 500 km s@xmath17 ) seen in the central region of ngc 4579 by @xcite also imply that its central co emission is harder to detect than the central emission in ngc 4569 .",
    "thus , ngc 4579 may not be such an unusual galaxy for its type , but simply observed at a less favorable inclination angle than ngc 4569 .      in  [ sec - tgas ] , we calculated gas depletion times by combining directly the co @xmath0=3 - 2 intensity with the star formation rate .",
    "if instead we use the co @xmath0=1 - 0 intensity from @xcite , and study exactly the same regions in each galaxy as in  [ sec - tgas ] , the picture becomes more complicated .",
    "values for the gas depletion time calculated using the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line are also given in table  [ tbl - tgas ] .",
    "for ngc 4254 , the gas depletion times remain very uniform when the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line is used instead of the @xmath0=3 - 2 line to trace the molecular gas .",
    "the average gas depletion time shows a larger dispersion , which hints at more local variations than are seen using the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line ; however , this could also be due to low signal - to - noise co @xmath0=1 - 0 spectra being included in our analaysis .    for ngc 4321 , when the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line is used , the line ratio is also quite uniform overall but the gas depletion time for the central region is now roughly twice as small as that of the disk .",
    "the gas depletion times in the co peaks associated with the spiral arms are intermediate between these two extremes .",
    "the disk - averaged gas depletion time remains about 50% larger than that of ngc 4254 whether the co @xmath0=1 - 0 or @xmath0=3 - 2 transition is used to trace the molecular gas .    for ngc 4569 , the gas depletion times",
    "now show significant variations , ranging from 9.0 gyr at the southern co @xmath0=3 - 2 peak to 1.8 gyr for the central region .",
    "the disk averaged value of 5.4 gyr , with its larger relative dispersion , also suggests more variation in the gas depletion time derived from the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line , and is now almost 3 times larger than the gas depletion time in ngc 4254 .",
    "thus , for these three galaxies , using the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line to calculate the gas depletion time instead of the @xmath0=3 - 2 line results in a greater spread in gas depletion times both within galaxies and from one galaxy to another .",
    "if we assume that the star formation efficiency ( and hence gas depletion time ) should not vary significantly from one normal spiral galaxy to another , then this analysis suggests that the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line may be a more direct tracer of the dense , star forming molecular gas than is the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line .",
    "this result is consistent with the analysis of @xcite , who find a nearly linear correlation between the co @xmath0=3 - 2 luminosity and the far - infrared luminosity ( as a tracer of star formation ) over 5 orders of magnitude in galaxy luminosity . the good correlation between the star formation rate surface density and the co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission suggests that the co @xmath0=3 - 2 transition probes sufficiently high gas densities to be a good tracer of the dense cores within molecular clouds that are forming stars with a high efficiency .",
    "in contrast , the co @xmath0=1 - 0",
    "line traces gas with a wider range of densities , including more diffuse material that is not directly involved in star formation . in this interpretation , using the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line results in a more accurate measurement of the instantaneous gas depletion time .",
    "an alternative interpretation would be that the star forming molecular gas ( and the gas depletion time ) is in fact well - traced by the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line , and the variations seen both within and between galaxies are real . in this case",
    ", regions with higher star formation efficiencies ( or smaller gas depletion times ) would be those with a higher rate of energy injected due to recent star formation per unit mass of molecular gas .",
    "this higher rate of energy injection could warm the molecular gas , producing brighter co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission and leading to a more uniform apparent gas depletion times when the co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission line is used , as observed .",
    "while such heating processes are undoubtedly at work in the ism , we argue that the interpretation of the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line as a direct tracer of dense star - forming gas is the more straightforward explanation .",
    "we have used the jcmt to map the co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission from four spiral galaxies in the virgo cluster .",
    "these galaxies are included in the sings survey @xcite and so have a wealth of information on their dust and interstellar medium properties .",
    "these galaxies also allow us to probe a range of galaxy properties including hi deficiency , star formation rate , and nuclear activity .",
    "bright co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission is detected over the extended disks of ngc 4254 , ngc4321 , and ngc 4569 ; ngc 4579 is weakly detected ( 3@xmath26 ) at one position in the disk and has only an upper limit in the central region . combining our data with co @xmath0=1 - 0 maps from @xcite , we derive disk - averaged co @xmath0=3 - 2/@xmath0=1 - 0 line ratios of 0.33 in ngc 4254 , 0.36 in ngc 4321 , and 0.25 in ngc 4569 .",
    "the line ratio in the center of ngc 4321 is significantly larger ( 0.79 ) , while ngc 4569 shows a gradient in the line ratio from 0.06 in the south to 0.53 in the north .",
    "the very weak co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission in ngc 4579 suggests a line ratio in the disk similar to the lowest value seen in ngc 4569 .",
    "these line ratios are towards the low end of the range typically measured in galaxies @xcite .",
    "however , previous observations have focused on the extreme central regions , which our data suggest may have enhanced line ratios in many galaxies .",
    "we combine h@xmath2 and 24 @xmath1 m images from the sings survey @xcite to obtain maps of the star formation rate following the prescription in @xcite .",
    "we combine these star formation rate images with maps of the molecular gas surface density derived from the co @xmath0=3 - 2 data to obtain maps of the instantaneous gas depletion timescale ( the inverse of the star formation efficiency ) .",
    "of the three co - bright galaxies , the disk - averaged gas depletion time is shortest for ngc 4254 ( 1.1 gyr ) , roughly 50% less than for ngc 4321 ( 1.7 gyr ) and ngc 4569 ( 1.6 gyr ) .",
    "the fourth galaxy , ngc 4579 , has weak co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission and small gas depletion times in the disk , 4 - 6 times smaller than in the other three galaxies .",
    "these times , which are substantially shorter than a hubble time , are a measure of the instantaneous gas depletion time and do not take into account possible replenishing of the dense molecular gas from more diffuse molecular or atomic gas .    we have compared the gas depletion times obtained using the co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission with those obtained using the co @xmath0=1 - 0 emission , which is the more commonly used tracer of molecular gas .",
    "we find that using the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line results in more uniform instantaneous gas depletion times both within galaxies and from one galaxy to another .",
    "we argue that the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line is a better tracer of the dense molecular gas involved in star formation than the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line . alternatively , real variations in the star formation efficiency may result in variation in the amount of heating per unit gas , leading to more uniform apparent gas depletion times using the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line .",
    "these two scenarios may be testable using radiative transfer codes and multiple co emission lines to measure the average physical conditions in the molecular gas .",
    "looking at the internal structure and external environment , we suggest that the smaller gas depletion time ( or larger star formation efficiency ) in ngc 4254 may be due to the fact that it seems to be encountering the dense portion of the virgo cluster for the first time @xcite . in ngc 4569",
    ", the gradient in the co @xmath0=3 - 2/@xmath0=1 - 0 line ratio ( and more weakly in the gas depletion time ) from south to north suggests that active ram pressure in the northern half of the galaxy may be producing an increase in the average density or temperature of the molecular gas .",

    "<S> we combine these data with published co @xmath0=1 - 0 , 24 @xmath1 m , and h@xmath2 images to measure the co line ratios , molecular gas masses , and instantaneous gas depletion times . for three galaxies in our sample ( ngc 4254 , ngc4321 , and ngc 4569 ) , we obtain molecular gas masses of @xmath3 m@xmath4 and disk - averaged instantaneous gas depletion times of 1.1 - 1.7 gyr . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the co @xmath0=3 - 2 line is a better tracer of the dense star forming molecular gas than the co @xmath0=1 - 0 line , as it shows a better correlation with the star formation rate surface density both within and between galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 4254 appears to have a larger star formation efficiency(smaller gas depletion time ) , perhaps because it is on its first passage through the virgo cluster . </S>",
    "<S> ngc 4569 shows a large - scale gradient in the gas properties traced by the co @xmath0=3 - 2/@xmath0=1 - 0 line ratio , which suggests that its interaction with the intracluster medium is affecting the dense star - forming portion of the interstellar medium directly . </S>",
    "<S> the fourth galaxy in our sample , ngc 4579 , has weak co @xmath0=3 - 2 emission despite having bright 24 @xmath1 m emission ; however , much of the central luminosity in this galaxy may be due to the presence of a central agn . </S>"
