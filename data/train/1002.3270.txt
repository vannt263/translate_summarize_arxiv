    "<S> this is not surprising since the semiclassical theories are known to be more accurate for large particle numbers . </S>",

    "<S> the gfmc ( dotted line ) and fes ( solid line ) models show some density oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> although the order of magnitude is correct , the oscillations are not in phase . </S>",
    "<S> this is attributed to the discrepancy of the semiclassical theory for particle numbers far from the shell or mid - shell closure , thus leading to an inaccurate sign of @xmath22 ( see @xcite for an exhaustive discussion ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fes model is expected to give best results for @xmath106 and @xmath107 . the slda model ( dashed line ) </S>",

    "<S> . _ @xcite leading to similar results with the slda model . </S>",
    "<S> the linear behavior of the fes particle density observed for @xmath108 , is a consequence of the breakdown of the semiclassical approximation near the classical turning point . </S>",
    "<S> we recover the usual exponential tail using the regularised formula ( [ rhoregul ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dotted - dashed line illustrates an improved density profile for which we have changed the overall sign into ( [ drho ] ) and switched to the regularised expression ( [ rhoregul ] ) for @xmath108 : in this case , the agreement with gfmc is much better .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have investigated finite fermions systems which are described by the haldane - wu statistics going beyond the tf approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state energy and the particle density of this system are derived analytically at zero temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we used the fes semiclassical theory as a parameter - free model of unitary fermi gases and we discussed shell effects as a function of the particle number and the position . considering that the semiclassical model is expected to give better results for large @xmath11 , we gave reasonably good agreement with two numerical studies . </S>",
