    "the multiplicity of pions per participating nucleon is known to be similar in nucleus - nucleus ( a+a ) and in inelastic proton - proton ( p+p ) interactions at the same collision energy per nucleon .",

    "similar picture emerges from the hadron statistical models within the grand canonical ensemble ( gce ) formulation . at fixed temperature and chemical potentials all hadron multiplicities are proportional to the system volume @xmath1 .",
    "taking @xmath1 to be proportional to the number of wounded nucleons @xmath2 in a+a collisions , one restores the wnm results for hadron multiplicities .",
    "production of strange hadrons appears to be quite different in p+p and heavy - ion collisions . in particular , the ratio of @xmath3 to @xmath4 multiplicities is significantly larger in collisions of heavy ions . it was advocated to interpret this _",
    "strangeness enhancement _ as a possible signature for the quark - gluon plasma creation  @xcite .",
    "a non - monotonic dependence of the @xmath3 to @xmath4 ratio as function of the collision energy ( the _ horn _ ) was predicted @xcite as a fingerprint of the deconfinement phase transition .",
    "the predicted behavior was indeed observed by the na49 collaboration in central pb+pb collisions @xcite at the sps energies ( for more details cf",
    "moreover , these findings have been recently confirmed by the rhic and lhc data  @xcite .",

    "numbers of strange quarks @xmath6 and antiquarks @xmath7 in a final state of p+p or a+a collisions are equal to each other due to the net strangeness conservation in strong interactions . in the sps energy range",
    "strange quarks are essentially carried by @xmath8 , @xmath9 mesons and @xmath10 hyperons . on the other hand , almost all @xmath7 created in the collision process",

    "for the event averages one obtains an approximate relation @xmath13 .",
    "this explains the choice of the @xmath3 multiplicity as an estimator for the total strangeness  @xcite .",
    "conservation of strangeness in large statistical systems can be treated within the gce formulation , in which all hadron multiplicities are proportional to the system volume @xmath1 . in small systems , however , one has to follow the canonical ensemble ( ce ) treatment @xcite .",
    "the multiplicities of ( anti)strange hadrons in ce decrease with decreasing volume faster than the gce multiplicities .",
    "a comparison of the statistical model results with hadron multiplicity data , within both ce and gce , evidences an incomplete strangeness equilibration . for reasonable fit of the data",

    "the difference of the @xmath0 ratio in p+p and pb+pb collisions is considered within the ce statistical model as a consequence of two strangeness suppression effects : ( a ) net strangeness conservation and ( b ) incomplete total strangeness equilibration .",

    "other physical differences between statistical systems created in p+p and pb+pb collisions which are not reduced to a and b are not considered .",

    "the energy scans with p+pb , ar+ca and xe+la collisions will be completed up to 2016 .",
    "in addition , a beam energy scan of pb+pb collisions , with much higher statistics than that performed by the na49 collaboration , is planned .",
