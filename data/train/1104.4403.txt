    "iron is the most popular chemical element in studies of both non - magnetic and magnetic a and later type stars thanks to quite numerous lines of the neutral and singly - ionized species in the visible spectrum .",
    "iron lines are used to determine stellar parameters , such as effective temperature , @xmath5 , surface gravity , @xmath6 , microturbulence velocity , @xmath7 , and , in the magnetic stars , also to investigate magnetic fields .",
    "therefore , the calculations of the iron lines have to be based on realistic line formation scenarios .    in the atmospheres with @xmath8 4500  k , fe  i is a minority species .",
    "number density of the minority species can easily deviate from the thermodynamical equilibrium ( te ) population due to small deviation of the mean intensity of ionizing radiation from the planck function . since the beginning of 1970th a number of studies attacked a problem of the non - local thermodynamic equilibrium ( non - lte ) line formation for fe  i in the sun and late type stars ( tanaka , 1971 ; athay & lites , 1972 ; boyarchuk et al .",

    "2005 ) here we list only the studies , where original model atom was produced .",
    "the non - lte effects in the hotter atmospheres were investigated by only gigas ( 1986 ) and rentzsch - holm ( 1996 ) .",
    "all these research came to a common conclusion that fe  i is subject to overionization in stellar atmospheres due to enhanced photoionization of the levels with the ionization edges in the ultra - violet ( uv ) and the fe  i lines are weakened compared to their lte strengths .",
    "however , a consensus on the expected magnitude of the non - lte effects was not reached .",
    "for example , the surface gravity correction for cool metal - poor atmospheres was calculated , in some studies , at the level of 0.5  dex , while no significant departures from lte were found by others .",
    "the discrepancies between different papers might be due to an incompleteness of the applied model atoms .",
    "mashonkina et al .",
    "( 2011 ) constructed a comprehensive model atom for iron using more than 3000 measured and predicted energy levels and showed that the departures from lte for fe  i decreased significantly in the atmospheres of solar - type stars , in particular , in the metal - poor atmospheres compared to those calculated in the previous non - lte studies .",
    "in this study , we revise the non - lte effects for the stellar parameter range characteristic of a - type stars .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "an introduction to the non - lte approach is given in the next section .",
    "sect.[sect : nlte ] describes briefly the method of the non - lte calculations for fe  i - fe  ii .",
    "the results for the two reference stars , the sun and procyon , are presented in sect.[sect : sun ] .",

    "we assume that the particle velocity distribution is maxwellian with a single kinetic temperature for various kind particles , i.e. , for electrons , atoms , and ions : @xmath9 .",
    "we consider that the occupation number of any atomic level is determined from the balance between radiative and collisional population and de - population processes , such as photoexcitation , photoionization and their inverse processes , inelastic collisions with electrons , atoms , molecules , dielectronic recombination , charge exchange , i.e. , from a statistical equilibrium ( se ) :    @xmath10    collision rate @xmath11 is defined by the local kinetic temperature @xmath12 and collider particle number density .",

    "radiative rate @xmath13 depends on the radiation field , which is , in general , highly non - local in character .",
    "radiative processes tend to destroy te .    in the nature , each chemical species possesses a huge number of bound energy levels approaching to the infinity . in practice ,",
    "the real atomic term structure is represented by the model atom with finite number of levels @xmath14 . to investigate the se of an atom , a large amount of various atomic data is required , such as energy levels , photoionization cross - sections for every level in the model atom , oscillator strengths ( @xmath15 ) for the entire set of allowed transitions , and collision excitation and ionization data for the entire set of transitions . for the last two decades ,",
    "the situation with atomic data has improved significantly . a fairly extensive set of accurate atomic data on photoionization cross - sections and oscillator strengths was calculated in the opacity project ( seaton  et  al . , 1994 ) and has become available via the topbase database .",
    "the iron project is in progress and provides the data for the fe group elements .",
    "quantum - mechanical _ ab initio _ calculations exist for electron impact excitation in a number of selected atoms and ions .",
    "however , for heavy elements beyond the fe group , much data are missing , in particular , for the high - excitation states .",
    "rough theoretical approximations are still used to evaluate inelastic collision cross - sections .",
    "the calculated se of an atom depends on the completeness of the adopted model atom and the accuracy of the used atomic data .",
    "the excitation and ionization states of the matter is calculated from the solution of combined se ( [ se ] ) and radiation transfer equations ( [ rt ] ) :    @xmath16    here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the absorption and emission coefficients , respectively .",
    "the radiation transfer equations have to be solved at frequences of all the radiative transitions in the atom which makes the non - lte calculations to be bulky . in non - lte , atomic level population @xmath19 at any depth point @xmath20 depends on the physical conditions throughout the atmosphere : @xmath21 . here , @xmath22 is the mean intensity .",
    "the models in which the saha - boltzmann equations are replaced by the physically more accurate se equations are called the non - lte models .    for comparison , in lte , level populations",
    "are calculated from the saha and boltzmann equations and depend only on local temperature and electron number density .",
    "this implies simple numerical calculations and the need in atomic data only for the spectral line under investigation .",
    "the lte assumption is valid if every transition in the atom is in detailed balance .",
    "this is not fulfilled in spectral line formation layers , where the mean - free path of photons is large and the intensity of radiation is far from being in te . to evaluate the effect of the departures from lte on line strengths and stellar parameters derived from these lines , one needs to solve the non - lte problem for a given chemical species .",
    "the non - lte calculations were performed using a revised version of the detail program ( butler & giddings , 1985 ) based on the accelerated lambda iteration ( ali ) scheme .",
