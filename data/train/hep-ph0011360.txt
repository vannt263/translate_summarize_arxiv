    "the photon linear collider ( plc ) makes use of the hard energy spectrum of the photons produced by compton backscattering of a high power laser light off the linac @xmath0 beam@xcite .",
    "therefore , a plc should be considered as an option of a future linear collider .",
    "this observation naturally leads us to the following questions :    * _ what new discovery can we expect at a photon linear collider in addition to what we will learn at its ` parent ' linear collider ? _ * _ does the plc option make a linear collider project more attractive ? _    in this report",
    ", i try to find the answer to the above two questions .",
    "i start my study by comparing the @xmath5 channel with the @xmath6 annihilation channel , which are both source of various new particles .",
    "all charged particles are pair produced in both channels , and neutral particles can be produced as @xmath1-channel resonances .",
    "there is , however , an important difference in the spin of the accessible @xmath1-channel resonances .",
    "the @xmath6 annihilation channel can not couple to a spin 0 resonance because of the electronic chirality conservation , whose breaking is suppressed by the tiny electron mass .",
    "the lowest spin of a particle that can be produced in the @xmath6 annihilation channel should hence be 1 .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath5 channel can couple to a spin 0 resonance , while it can not couple to a spin 1 resonance due to spin statistics of the @xmath7 two - photon system@xcite .",
    "it is this stunning difference between the two channels that makes a plc complementary to @xmath6 colliders .",
    "we can probe the scalar sector in the @xmath1-channel of the colliding two photons at a plc , whereas it can be probed only in association with another particle production at @xmath6 colliders .",
    "this possibility gives a plc the unique potential of becoming the best observatory of the scalar sector , or the higgs sector .",
    "we should take this opportunity very seriously , because the scalar sector is the least known sector of the standard model ( sm ) , and because its detailed understanding is probably the most important key in our search for physics beyond the sm .",
    "there are many excellent reports@xcite on the role of a plc as the laboratory of the higgs sector , and i will give only a few general remarks in section 2 .",
    "in addition to the precision measurements of the two - photon decay partial width and branching fractions of the higgs bosons , i would like to emphasize the importance of probing new interactions , including cp violating ones , in the scalar sector .",
    "plc is particularly well tailored for studying the cp property of resonances and interactions , because the two @xmath7 two - photon initial states can form a cp - even and a cp - odd state , and they can be prepared by using linear polarizations of the laser beams . the power and limitation of plc with linearly polarized laser beams are discussed .",
    "once the higgs property is determined well in @xmath5 collisions , measurement of the higgs-@xmath4-@xmath3 coupling may be done in the @xmath8 collision mode@xcite .",
    "the role of a plc in our study of supersymmetry is discussed in section 3 . because the available highest c.m .",
    "energy in the @xmath5 mode is about 80% of the original @xmath6 collision c.m .",
    "energy , = < < 0.83 , [ def : tau ] one generally expects that the @xmath9 mode is the discovery channel for those susy particles which may escape detection at the lhc . here",
    "@xmath10 is the normalized laser frequency which is bounded from above , @xmath11 , in order not to loose the photon beam by soft @xmath9 pair production .",
    "a plc should therefore provide us with measurements which can not be matched by the other experiments .",
    "formation of squark - onia , precision measurements of susy particle properties , and measurements of cp violation in the chargino sector are examined . in the @xmath12 mode ,",
    "single production of s - electron in association with a neutralino may turn out to be the best laboratory of s - lepton flavor physics .",
    "the mode can be the precision susy factory if s - electron pair can be produced .    in section 4 ,",
    "i give a few remarks on the role of a plc in the study of the properties of the sm particles and their interactions .",
    "such studies could be the main theme of high energy physics if neither the lhc nor @xmath9 collider fail to identify the physics beyond the sm .",
    "i also emphasize the importance of preparing all the sm background simulation programs in the helicity amplitude level so that they can be simulated for arbitrary polarization of the colliding photons .    throughout this report",
    ", i use a very simple approximation to a plc where the compton scattering formula is used to generate colliding photons in the exactly backward direction .",
    "this description gives a good approximation only for the hard part of the photon beams@xcite .",
    "[ fig : aalumi ] , i show the normalized effective luminosity function [ daalumi ] in this approximation for four values of the laser frequency parameter @xmath13 , @xmath14 , 1.6 , 0.8 and 0.4 from the right to the left , and for three cases of the electron and laser polarizations , ( a ) to ( c ) . only the region where @xmath15 are shown , where the approximation may hold . in ( a ) and ( b ) , circularly polarized laser beams ( @xmath16 ) are used to make collisions of definite helicity photons , and the luminosity distribution is given for the collision of two right - handed photons @xmath17 , denoted by solid lines , that of right- and left - handed photons @xmath18 , denoted by long - dashed lines , and that of two left - handed photons @xmath19 , denoted by short - dashed lines . in ( a ) , both photons are obtained by setting @xmath20 , whereas in ( b ) they are obtained by setting @xmath21 , as a more realistic case .",
    "although the laser light may be 100% circularly polarized ( @xmath22 ) , the colliding beams have finite polarization .",
    "it is worth noting here that nearly optimal monochromaticity of the colliding photon polarizations is obtained with the electron beam polarization of @xmath23 which may well be realized .",
    "the curves in ( c ) are obtained for @xmath24 and @xmath25 when the two laser photons have parallel linear polarization . here",
    "@xmath26 stands for the degree of linear polarization .",
    "solid lines show collisions when two photons have parallel linear polarizations , and dashed lines are for perpendicular linear polarizations",
    ". the former two - photon state is cp - even while the latter state is cp - odd .",
    "we can clearly see that capability of distinguishing the two cases is small for high laser frequencies ( @xmath13 ) or when @xmath27 .    before closing this section ,",
    "i should note that the actual luminosity function may depend strongly on the property of the incoming electron beams and on the electron - to - photon conversion efficiency .",
    "we may express & = & ^2 l_ee^ ( ) , [ aalumi ] + & = & l_ee^ ( ) , [ ealumi ] where @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ aalumi ] ) while @xmath29 in eq .",
    "( [ ealumi ] ) .",
    "@xmath30 is the geometric luminosity of the colliding beams in the absence of beam - beam effects , and @xmath31 denotes the conversion factor of order 0.5 . because the geometric luminosity can be significantly larger than actual collision luminosity in the or modes , there is a possibility that the luminosity integrated over the high @xmath32 region shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : aalumi ] can be comparable or even larger than the corresponding luminosity of collisions .",
    "when we compare physics capability of a plc with its parent or lc , i assume that the integrated @xmath33 luminosity in the high @xmath32 region is about the same as the luminosity of collisions .",
    "it should be remarked here that the luminosity distributions as shown in fig .  1 do not include contributions from the beamstrahlung . at a plc , since",
    "the electron beams are tuned to maximize the luminosity , more beamstrahlung may be produced than in the corresponding collisions .",
    "it is therefore important to estimate the effects of beamstrahlung in all quantitative studies , especially in the relatively low @xmath34 region where we expect to have high degree of linear polarization transfer .",
    "a plc associated with a 500  gev lc will have the strongest case when a light higgs boson exists below 200  gev . despite failures of discovering the higgs boson so far ,",
    "this is the most favored scenario of particle physics at the moment , because it is favored by the electroweak precision measurements@xcite , and because it is predicted by all supersymmetric theories with grand unification of the three gauge couplings@xcite .",
    "such a higgs boson may still be found at lep200 or at tevatron if its mass is very near to the present lower mass bound ( @xmath35 ) and if it has nearly maximum coupling to the @xmath36 and @xmath3 bosons .",
    "it should certainly be discovered at lhc through gluon - gluon or @xmath37 fusion , unless its couplings to gluons and @xmath37 are both very small , or if it has little decay branching fractions into all the observable channels , such as  , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "it should be definitely discovered at an lc as long as it has a significant coupling to the @xmath36 and @xmath3 bosons , the condition which is required for a good fit to the electroweak data and for the perturbative unification of the gauge couplings in susy models .",
    "a 500  gev lc will measure its couplings to @xmath3 and @xmath36 bosons very accurately , and measure its decay branching fractions@xcite , br@xmath40 , br@xmath41 and br@xmath42 with a good accuracy , as well as br@xmath43 and br@xmath44 .",
    "the plc will in addition measure the partial width @xmath45 at a few % level@xcite .",
    "because the @xmath46 coupling receives contributions from all the massive charged particles that couple to the higgs boson , its accurate measurement will give us decisive information on the scalar sector when combined with accurate measurements in collisions .",
    "for instance , by using the couplings that are measured in collisions , one may estimate the higgs coupling to the top - quarks and other new states by using the @xmath45 data .",
    "i note in passing that the higgs-@xmath47 coupling can be most accurately measured in the @xmath8 collision mode of a plc@xcite .",
    "it is clear that accurate knowledge of both the higgs-@xmath33 and the higgs-@xmath47 couplings will be powerful in probing the quantum numbers of the charged particles whose masses originate from the electroweak symmetry breakdown .",
    "in addition , i would like to emphasize the importance of the cp measurements in the scalar sector . because the gauge interactions do not allow cp violation",
    ", non - gauge interactions should be responsible for the observed cp violation , and ultimately , for the origin of the matter dominated universe .",
    "the non - gauge interactions among scalar bosons and between scalars and fermions are among the most likely sources of cp violation , and precise measurements of the cp properties of the higgs bosons and their interactions may open a completely new road in our investigation .",
    "the plc will be an excellent laboratory for cp violation in the scalar sector , because it allows us to prepare the @xmath7 initial states with definite cp parity . by denoting the two colliding photon helicities as @xmath48 and @xmath49 ,",
    "the cp transformation changes their signs * cp _ 1 , _ 2 > = -_1 , -_2 > [ cpaa ] and hence the two states with definite cp parity are obtained as * cp ( + + >  > ) = ( + + >  > ) .",
    "[ cpaa2 ] the cp - even state has two linearly polarized photons with the polarization planes parallel , while the cp - odd state has perpendicular linear polarization directions .",
    "if cp is a good symmetry of the scalar sector , the cp - even higgs boson can couple only to the cp - even initial state , whereas the cp - odd higgs boson can couple only to the cp - odd initial state .",
    "* *    in fig .",
    "1(c ) , i show the luminosity when the two laser beams are both linearly polarized ( @xmath25 ) along the same direction in the perfect backward scattering configuration .",
    "the compton scattering with unpolarized beams then produces collisions of high energy linearly polarized photons which are partially cp - even ( parallel , or @xmath50 ) and partially cp - odd ( perpendicular , or @xmath51 ) .",
    "when the initial laser polarization planes are made to the perpendicular orientation , the luminosity functions of the cp - even and cp - odd configurations are reversed .",
    "we note that in this simple compton scattering scheme , the difference between cp - even and cp - odd luminosity functions is significant only for relatively low laser frequencies ( @xmath52 ) or at relatively low invariant mass , @xmath53 .",
    "the linear polarization of the plc will hence be useful for studying the cp property of the neutral scalar boson whose mass is less than about 50% of the initial collision energy , @xmath54 .",
    "because of the necessity of relatively low @xmath34 values to achieve high degree of linear polarization transfer , backgrounds from beamstrahlung photons should be estimated in quantitative studies .",
    "it is worth noting here that it is an easy task for lc to distinguish between a cp - even and cp - odd neutral higgs bosons .",
    "such discrimination can e.g. be made by a simple angular correlation study in the process @xmath55 followed by the decays @xmath56@xcite .",
    "what is difficult in the mode is to detect small cp violation effects in the study of dominantly cp - even higgs bosons .",
    "the observable effects are expected to be rather small in collisions because the small cp - odd component can contribute to the process only in the one - loop order whereas the dominant cp - even component contributes at the tree - level . at a plc",
    ", both components are expected to contribute in the one - loop order , and hence we can generally expect bigger cp asymmetries@xcite . the use of the linearly polarized laser light allows us to make the precision cp measurement a counting experiment when the higgs boson mass is less than about 50% of the collision energy@xcite .",
    "although we may need to rely more on the final state decay angular correlation studies for higher mass bosons , the advantage of larger cp asymmetry expected at a plc will persist for all the neutral spin - less states that couple to the channel .",
    "a plc will be powerful in studying / discovering the neutral higgs bosons ( or its partners ) which have suppressed couplings to the @xmath3 and @xmath36 bosons@xcite .",
    "such states are expected in multiple higgs doublet models including the susy - sm , and in fact their existence at or below the tev scale makes the unification of the three gauge couplings possible in the minimal susy - sm@xcite .",
    "the precision electroweak experiments constrain the mass of the higgs boson which has significant couplings to the @xmath36 and @xmath3 bosons to be less than about 200  gev , or else there should be subtle cancellation among new physics contributions .",
    "the degree of subtleness of this cancellation increases as the mass of the higgs boson increases .",
    "therefore it is most natural for us to expect that a light higgs boson of mass in the range @xmath57 has nearly the maximal couplings to the @xmath36 and @xmath3 bosons , and hence its heavier partners do not have significant couplings to the weak bosons .",
    "such states are difficult to produce singly at collisions , and they can be discovered at a plc if their masses lie in the range @xmath58 .    as an example of how heavier higgs bosons may be found at a plc ,",
    "i show in fig .",
    "2(a ) the cross section of the process [aatt ] as a function of the invariant mass of the final state , @xmath59 .",
    "the cross section is calculated for a 500  gev lc with the  luminosity function of fig .",
    "1(a ) at the highest laser frequency ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "it should be noted that because of the high threshold ( @xmath61 ) , only the peak region of the luminosity functions contributes where the purity of the collisions of right - handed photons ( @xmath62 ) is high .",
    "the thick short dashed line shows the prediction of qed . the thick solid line ( long - dashed line )",
    "shows the prediction where a cp - odd ( cp - even ) scalar boson of mass 400  gev is produced as an @xmath1-channel resonance . for definiteness",
    ", we use the mssm ( minimal susy - sm ) prediction for the total and partial widths of a 400  gev cp - odd higgs boson , a , br@xmath63 , br@xmath64 for @xmath65 , @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68 as chosen in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . as a comparison , predictions for the cp - even higgs boson case",
    "are obtained simply by reversing the cp - parity of the state while keeping all the other properties .",
    "it is clearly seen that the interference pattern with the qed amplitude is very sensitive to the cp - parity of the resonance .",
    "in fact the whole difference appears in the helicity amplitudes @xmath69 where both @xmath70 and @xmath71 quarks are left - handed .",
    "the thick lines show the distributions when all the helicities are summed up , whereas the thin lines show those when the @xmath72 events ( denoted as ` ll ' ) are selected .",
    "note , however , that even though the signal is clearer when the ll events are selected , only those events when one of the @xmath36 s decay leptonically can be used to distinguish the ll events from the dominant rr events . still , about 40% of all the events may be used for such helicity analysis .",
    "it may be worth noting here that even the 6-jet events can be used to distinguish between the ll+rr modes and the lr+rl modes . in our example , because of suppressed @xmath73 luminosity distribution in fig .",
    "1(a ) , very small fraction of all the pairs have the polarization lr+rl .",
    "a more serious problem at a plc is that the invariant mass of the colliding system , @xmath74 , can only be measured through the final top - quark momentum measurement .",
    "accurate knowledge of the top - quark mass and their decay properties which will be obtained in the collision experiments will be used to refine such measurements .",
    "2(b ) shows the @xmath75 distributions when a gaussian smearing with the error m ( ) = 3   [ mtterror ] is applied .",
    "comparisons between the distributions of fig .",
    "2(a ) and fig .",
    "2(b ) show that the sharp peaks and dips in the original curves are smeared out and accurate knowledge of the measurement error , @xmath76 , will be needed to determine the mass and the widths of the higgs resonances .",
    "the quoted error of 3  gev may be too optimistic especially for semi - leptonic modes where at least one hard neutrino is missing .",
    "more work is needed to make the error as small as possible , for both 6-jet and semi - leptonic modes .    from fig .",
    "1(c ) , we find that linearly polarized laser beams produce little cp discriminating power at large @xmath13 , or at large @xmath34 .",
    "when a scalar resonance is found in the mass range of @xmath77 , we should refer to the final state analysis to determine its cp property . as an example of cp - sensitive observables ,",
    "i show in fig .",
    "2(c ) the @xmath75 dependences of @xmath78 , where @xmath79 stands for the difference of the azimuthal angles of the @xmath70-decay and @xmath71-decay planes along the momentum axis .",
    "the thin lines are predictions before smearing and the thick lines after smearing with the error of eq .",
    "( [ mtterror ] ) .",
    "the asymmetry has opposite signs between the cp - odd and the cp - even resonances , whose predictions are shown by the solid and the long - dashed curves , respectively .",
    "the asymmetry is found to be rather small because of cancellation between the contributions from longitudinally and transversally polarized @xmath36 s .",
    "one can certainly find final - state observables which have significantly higher sensitivity to the cp - properties of the resonance , by taking account of the @xmath36-decay distributions .    in summary ,",
    "if the resonance mass is low enough , say @xmath80 , we can use the linear polarization of laser beams to determine its cp property .",
    "if the resonance has significant decay branching fraction into spinful heavy particles , such as or @xmath81 , it is relatively easy to determine its cp property by making use of the decay angular correlations .",
    "only when the mass is in the range @xmath77 and when it rarely decays into heavy spinful particles , we will have difficulty in determining its cp property .",
    "the possibility of giving high degree of linear polarization to the colliding high - energy photons , that has been discussed at this workshop@xcite may turn out to be useful in such cases .",
    "i also feel that more serious work may be needed to determine if the @xmath38 decay mode of a heavy resonance can be used to study its spin and cp - parity at a plc . in general , it is important to make cp measurements at all possible channels , so that we can probe cp - violation in the mixing , in the production , and in various decay channels@xcite .",
    "at a plc , we can produce a pair of squarks , sleptons , charged higgs bosons and charginos above the threshold . because the collision at a plc can reach the c.m .",
    "energy of at most about 80% of the corresponding collision energy , it is unlikely that these particles are discovered at a plc .",
    "the question is what advantage does a plc have over its parent lc when studying their properties .    in case of squarks , sleptons and charged higgs bosons ,",
    "we note that the pair can be produced in the @xmath1-wave at a plc , whereas the pair can only be produced in the @xmath82-wave near threshold at collisions pairs where the electronic chilarity of the initial channel is transfered to the final state . with proper choice of initial @xmath83 beam polarizations",
    ", these pairs can be produced at @xmath1-wave near the threshold . ] .",
    "this can lead to a higher production rate at a plc depending on the factor of @xmath84 in eq .",
    "( [ aalumi ] ) .",
    "it is possible that the production rate larger than that at the parent lc can be achieved at a plc if the factor of @xmath85 can be made significantly larger than the actual luminosity . in such cases , precision measurements of the charged scalar boson properties",
    "may be performed at a plc . in addition , in case of squarks , we may find the @xmath1-wave @xmath86 squark - onia at a plc .",
    "there might be a case when the squark - pair production is sensitive to the higgs - boson exchange between stop quarks@xcite .    in case of chargino - pair production near the threshold ,",
    "they are produced in the @xmath1-wave both in and collisions .",
    "the only difference is that the pair is in the spin - triplet state in case of collisions while it is in the spin - singlet state at a plc .",
    "i do not know if this difference leads to a significant difference in the study of their properties .",
    "because the @xmath1-wave spin - singlet state is cp - odd , a plc may be useful in probing the cp property of the chargino - photon couplings .",
    "this however requires a plc with relatively low laser frequencies ( hence a higher energy ) , and the sensitivity should be compared with that of the final state analysis in the mode@xcite .",
    "there is one point which might be worth noting .",
    "both the sfermion - pair and chargino - pair production cross sections are uniquely determined by qed in the leading order of collisions .",
    "this uniqueness of the tree - level amplitudes may help us identify radiative effects .",
    "certainly a combination of precision measurements of production cross sections at both and collisions will give us useful additional information on the interactions of the susy particles and the charged higgs bosons .",
    "finally , the collision mode of a plc may become a unique laboratory of slepton flavor physics@xcite if @xmath87 or @xmath88 ( @xmath89 ) can be produced in association with a neutralino ( chargino ) .",
    "flavor oscillation in the slepton sector can be most clearly studied in this channel where a susy particle state with a definite flavor and chilarity quantum numbers can be produced at the time of collisions .    before concluding this section ,",
    "let me comment on the possibility of precision susy tests in the process@xcite @xmath90 for the three distinct channels , @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the process is most suited for precision measurements of the s - electron masses and their couplings to the gauginos , which may give us precious information on the heavy susy particle masses@xcite .",
    "dedicated study of the collider option is worth serious attention , which requires studies independent of the beams which are optimized for the plc option .",
    "when we consider the sm processes as a probe of new physics , i think that a plc can have an advantage over its parent lc when we study in detail the @xmath86 channel , by using the monochromaticity of high @xmath34 region with high laser frequency , or when we study the cp property by using the linear polarization with relatively low laser frequency",
    ". measurements of @xmath36 and top - quark edm@xcite are examples of the latter . as for the @xmath86 channel , @xmath94@xcite , @xmath95@xcite and @xmath96@xcite final states",
    "are all important because they should couple to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector to obtain their masses . that the electroweak precision measurements favor the sm higgs boson of mass below about 200  gev implies that if the higgs boson ( whose coupling to @xmath36 and @xmath3 bosons are significant ) is much heavier than 200  gev or absent , there should be new physics that couple to @xmath36 and @xmath3 bosons . because it should affect the @xmath36 and @xmath3 properties significantly",
    ", we should be able to identify its effect at lhc or at a lepton collider .",
    "the combined study of the @xmath97 channel at lc and the @xmath86 channel at a plc may be most fruitful in the search of such new interactions .",
    "i would like to note also that detailed studies of purely neutral gauge boson scattering processes , @xmath98 , @xmath47 and @xmath94 , may give us useful information on new physics that affect these channels either in the tree - level or through radiative effects .",

    "all the sm processes should be generated for an arbitrary set of the stokes parameters of the incoming photons .",
    "for instance , since massless leptons and quarks can not be produced at large scattering angles from @xmath7 two photons in the lowest order of qed , @xmath7 luminosity functions may be monitored by using higher order processes , such as @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , or by using @xmath95@xcite .",
    "hadron jet shape from @xmath102 processes may also be sensitive to the ratio of @xmath7 and @xmath103 collisions because we expect @xmath7 photons to produce fatter jets .",
    "the @xmath7 luminosity function may be measured more efficiently by reversing the laser and electron polarizations simultaneously but in one side only , which leaves all the distributions the same while replacing the @xmath7 and @xmath104 distributions@xcite .",
