    "relaxation for discrete optimization problems is a basic and generic strategy to solve them approximately .",
    "using relaxation techniques by which a part of an optimization problem is modified , we substitute easy problems for hard problems to solve .",
    "a striking example is a relaxation for integer programming ( ip ) problems .",
    "although the ip problem is generally np - hard , the relaxed linear programming ( lp ) problem belongs to the class of p  @xcite .",
    "this fact demonstrates that the lp relaxation enables us to approximate the ip problem in polynomial time .",
    "the technique is applied to various practical optimizations such as vehicle routing  @xcite , scheduling  @xcite , and boolean compressed sensing  @xcite .    in this relaxation strategy ,",
    "evaluating the performance of approximations is an important issue both for worst - case and average - case analysis . with improvement of mathematical techniques ,",
    "worst - case analyses have been strongly advanced in theoretical computer science .",
    "the relaxation plays a key role in the construction of constant - factor - approximation algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems  @xcite .",
    "another attractive issue is average - case behavior of approximations for randomized optimization problems .",
    "it provides not only prediction of the performance of approximations but also typical hardness of optimizations .",
    "analytical studies of greedy algorithms reveal average properties of problems and their intrinsic structures  @xcite .",
    "it is still challenging , however , to study the typical behavior of relaxation analytically .",
    "typical hardness of the optimization problems also has attracted physicists interests because it is described using a type of phase transition in statistical mechanics . with the development of the spin - glass theory since the 1970s  @xcite , a mean - field picture with replica theory has been established .",
    "the spin - glass techniques were then applied to many optimization problems .",
    "the picture of phase transitions breaking a replica symmetry ( rs ) is associated with the typical hardness of optimizations  @xcite . among them , the minimum vertex cover ( min - vc ) has also been studied as a good example to which the spin - glass theory is applied .",
    "it is a well - known np - hard combinatorial optimization problem defined on a graph .",
    "various types of exact or approximation algorithms such as a leaf removal ( lr )  @xcite are proposed .",
    "the difficulty of approximation has been studied by computer scientists  @xcite . in the statistical  mechanical view , the average - case properties have been studied extensively in terms of phase transition  @xcite . for instance , mean - field analyses of the min - vc on random graphs conclude that replica symmetry breaking ( rsb ) occurs at a critical average degree  @xcite",
    ". typical behavior of the lr and its variants are also studied in solving the min - vc approximately  @xcite .",
    "they strongly associate the typical hardness in approximation with the mean - field picture of the rsb transition .",
    "recently , average properties of the minimum hitting set ( min - hs ) , the min - vc on hypergraphs , are also analyzed  @xcite .",
    "while the min - hs involves the multi - body interactions from the view of statistical mechanics , it is suggested that the goodness of the lr algorithm is characterized by the phase transition in the spin - glass theory .",
    "the non - trivial relation between the replica symmetry and the typical hardness in approximation is also suggested in the case of continuous relaxation by physicists  @xcite .",
    "they studied continuous relaxation with a spherical constraint , which changes optimization problems to np - hard quadratically constrained programming problems .",
    "although it is still difficult to solve the relaxed problems , these studies indicate the existence of the typical tightness of relaxation techniques .",
    "it is of interest whether the relation holds in the case of polynomially solvable relaxation such as the lp relaxation . in theoretical computer science ,",
    "mathematical analysis of the lp relaxation for min - vcs with weights following an exponential distribution is performed  @xcite .",
    "such analyses revealed that the lp relaxation is closely related to the belief propagation in statistical physics and it is asymptotically tight if the belief propagation can converge with high probability .",
    "recently , the typical behavior of the lp relaxation for the unweighted min - vcs is studied numerically  @xcite , suggesting that a threshold of good / wrong approximation is close to the rs / rsb one and that it is well above a mathematical prediction . in our previous letter",
    "@xcite , we proposed a statistical  mechanical analysis of the lp relaxation and showed that these two thresholds are coincident .",
    "these results constitute a demonstration that the lp relaxation typically approximates an np - hard problem with good accuracy .",
    "as described in this paper , we study the typical behavior of the lp relaxation for the min - vcs defined on @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs using statistical  mechanical techniques .",
    "the min - vc with @xmath1 has a novel property called half integrality , which enables us to reduce the continuous degree of freedom in the lp to three states .",
    "consequently , a three - state lattice - gas model called an lp  ip model is introduced for studying the lp relaxation of the min - vc .",
    "mechanical analysis derives successfully an analytical threshold of the typical hardness of the lp relaxation , which coincides with the rs / rsb transition of the original min - vc .",
    "although a brief report on the lp  ip model based on the replica method has already been published  @xcite , this paper presents the full details of statistical  mechanical analyses of the lp relaxation for min - vcs including the analysis of the cavity method .",
    "additionally , we discuss the lp relaxation for the min - hs to examine whether its typical hardness is associated with the rs / rsb transition . because the min - hs , unfortunately , has no half - integrality , the lp",
    " ip model does not completely capture the lp relaxation of the min - hs but still provides an interesting feature on the stability of integral solutions against a perturbation toward continuous values .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the following section ,",
    "we define the min - vc and its lp relaxation . to investigate randomized problems , random graphs and their useful properties are also introduced .",
    "we explain the definition of average - case properties over random graphs and the typical behavior of the lp relaxation . in section iii",
    "we propose the lp ",
    "ip model and present details of the analysis using the replica method .",
    "the model with three - state ising spins includes the min - vc .",
    "it also includes lp - relaxed solutions as specific limits in a model parameter . by choosing the parameter in the model appropriately ,",
    "we obtain three rs solutions for ground states of the model .",
    "we also devote some discussion to their stability . in section iv , we present some numerical results of the lp relaxation . in the case of the min - vcs ,",
    "the statistical  mechanical analysis agrees well with the numerical results . for the min - hs , however , analytical results are no longer coincident with the numerical results but these results suggest that the typical hardness of the lp relaxation is associated with the rs / rsb transition .",
    "the last section is devoted to a summary and discussion of the results and salient implications . in the appendix , an alternative cavity analysis of the lp ",
    "ip model is presented .",

    ", the min - vc problems on hypergraphs ( @xmath27 ) is especially called the min - hs .",
    "the min - vc and min - hs , as well as other ip problems , are difficult to solve exactly in their worst case .      the lp relaxation is a fundamental approximation for the ip problem . to use the lp relaxation , it is sufficient to replace the integral conditions @xmath28 in the ip with continuous ones @xmath29 . in the case of the min - vc ,",
    "the lp - relaxed problem reads @xmath30 although this change on degrees of freedom engenders good feasibility of the problems , it might provide optimal solutions different from the ip problems .",
    "from the view of computational complexity and approximation , it is important whether the optimums can be obtained exactly , or not , using the lp relaxation .",

    "we define a matrix @xmath32 as a totally unimodular matrix if all sub - determinants of @xmath32 take only @xmath33 , @xmath34 , or @xmath35 .",
    "the theorem claims that the optimal value of the lp - relaxed problem is equal to that of the original ip problem if the matrix @xmath32 is a totally unimodular matrix and @xmath36 is an integral vector .",
    "because an incident matrix @xmath37 of a hypertree , i.e. , a hypergraph with no cycles , is totally unimodular , the theorem ensures that the optimal value of the min - vc on a hypertree can be found exactly by the lp relaxation .      as described in sec .",

    ", we introduce the erds - rnyi random graphs as a graph ensemble . the erds ",
    "rnyi random graphs are generated by choosing edges from all pairs of @xmath18 vertices with probability @xmath38 .",

    "the degree distribution then converges to the poisson distribution with mean @xmath42 in the large @xmath18 limit .",

    "rnyi random graphs have been studied using the replica method  @xcite and cavity method  @xcite developed in the spin - glass theory .",

    "we especially use the replica - exchange monte carlo ( emc )  @xcite method to accelerate equilibration of the system .",
    "we set 50 replicas with different values of chemical potential .",
    "an optimal value on each graph is evaluated by the minimum density found in at least @xmath189 monte carlo steps .",
    "it is then averaged over @xmath190 random graphs with @xmath191 vertices and extrapolated to @xmath192 using a quadratic function of @xmath193 .",
    "the evaluated optimal values are compared to the analytical rs solutions of the lp  ip model .",
    "the other is lp relaxation .",
    "it is performed mainly to examine the validity of lp - limit solutions for both min - vcs and min - hss .",
    "we generate at least 800 random graphs and solve the lp - relaxed problems by a revised simplex method using lp_solve_5.5 solver  @xcite . especially in the case of min - vcs , the lr algorithm is executed as pretreatment because of accurate estimation of the half - integral ratio @xmath188 .",
    "we first discuss numerical results for the optimal or approximate values of min - vcs .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows optimal or approximate cover ratios obtained using the emc and lp relaxation . for a relatively small average degree ,",
    "it is apparent that the rs solutions and lp - relaxed numerical results well agree with the optimal values estimated by the emc .",
    "this shows that the lp relaxation typically approximates the original problems in good accuracy in the rs phase .",
    "in contrast , when the average degree is above the critical threshold @xmath2 , the rs solutions in the ip - limit become unstable .",
    "it leads to a wrong evaluation for the optimal values compared to the emc",
    ". then higher rsb solutions are necessary to estimate the optimal values exactly . in the case of the lp relaxation ,",
    "our statistical ",
    "mechanical prediction still agrees with the numerical data .",
    "we also confirm that the lp relaxation typically fails to estimate the optimal values if the average degree is larger than @xmath194 .",
    "the lp - relaxed approximate value of the min - vc goes to @xmath195 in the large @xmath42 limit , while the optimal value of the min - vc is asymptotically close to @xmath35 .     as a function of the average degree @xmath42 .",

    "the solid and dotted lines respectively show the rs solutions in the ip - limit and the lp - limit .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents the critical average degree @xmath199 . ]",
    "next , we specifically examine the half - integral ratio @xmath188 representing a typical property of the approximate solutions . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is apparent that numerical data obtained using the lp relaxation is well above our analytic prediction . generally speaking ,",
    "lp - relaxed problems have several optimal extreme - point solutions because of the existence of a leaf , a pair of vertices either of which are of degree one .",
    "for instance , we assume that a graph @xmath200 consists of an odd cycle and a leaf , and that a vertex in the cycle is connected to one in the leaf by an edge",
    ". then , an lp - relaxed min - vc on @xmath200 has two solutions : one has all half - integral variables .",
    "the other has integral variables in the leaf .",
    "if one simply runs a solver , then one obtains the average ratio with half - integral variables , not the minimum ratio @xmath188 predicted by the lp  ip model . for this reason , the discrepancy in @xmath188 arises .",
    "we therefore perform an lr algorithm before executing the lp relaxation , by which half - integral variables induced by the leafs can be avoided .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the minimum half - integral ratio estimated using the procedure .",
    "as expected , the modified lp method reduces the number of half - integral variables after performing the lr algorithm .",
    "therefore , this lr+lp method obtains the optimal extreme - point solutions and improves the numerical estimation of @xmath188 .",
    "although there remains a finite - size effect for small sizes and around the threshold @xmath201 , the numerical estimations are close to the analytic results with increasing size .",
    "our analysis correctly predicts not only the approximate value of @xmath53 , but also the typical property of the lp relaxation .     as a function of the average degree @xmath42 .",
    "circles denote data obtained only using the revised simplex method with vertex cardinality @xmath202 .",
    "other open marks are numerical results obtained using the simplex method after running a leaf removal algorithm with @xmath196 , @xmath203 , @xmath190 , and @xmath204 .",
    "these are averaged over @xmath198 random graphs .",
    "the solid line represents the rs solution in the lp - limit .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents the critical average degree @xmath199 . ]",
    "lastly , we present the case of min - hs problems with @xmath185 .",
    "fig  [ fig3 ] shows the optimal values estimated using the emc and the approximate values obtained by the lp relaxation , together with the analytical results derived in the previous section .",
    "all the results coincide mutually for a sufficiently small average degree .",
    "the relaxed values , however , are markedly smaller than the optimal values of the original problem above the critical average degree @xmath205 , where the replica symmetry of the min - hs is broken .",
    "we therefore confirm that the lp relaxation typically fails to approximate min - hss in the rsb region . as a striking difference between min - vcs and min - hss ,",
    "we point out that the rs solutions in the lp - limit are also unstable above the critical threshold .",
    "whereas the discrepancy between the numerical lp - relaxed results and the analytic estimations is quite small as shown in fig  [ fig3 ] , it increases gradually as @xmath42 becomes large . in the large-@xmath42 limit",
    ", the lp - relaxed value on @xmath0-uniform graphs converges to @xmath206 whereas the analytic solutions converge to @xmath195 .",
    "our result implies that the existence of the rsb region in the lp - limit results from the lack of half - integrality in min - hss . to obtain a better analytic prediction",
    ", one must consider the model with more degrees of freedom , beyond the half - integrality condition .     as a function of the average degree @xmath42 .",
    "circles are numerical results given by the replica exchange monte carlo ( emc ) method .",
    "square marks denote the data obtained using the revised simplex method for vertex cardinalities of @xmath202 ( open ) and @xmath207 ( filled ) .",

    "the solid and dotted lines respectively show the rs solutions in the ip - limit and the lp - limit .",
    "the vertical dashed line represents the critical average degree @xmath208 . ]",
    "in this paper , we describe the details of the statistical  mechanical analysis of typical behavior of the lp relaxation .",
    "the lp relaxation of the min - vc can be mapped onto the lp  ip model with three - state ising variables assisted by the novel property called half - integrality .",
    "three distinct ground states are derived by fixing a parameter @xmath82 of the model and taking a large field ( zero temperature ) limit .",
    "the replica method in the spin - glass theory enables us to solve the model approximately in these limits . in the ip - limit with @xmath119 ,",
    "the ground states are reduced to optimal solutions of the original min - vcs .",
    "the ground states in the lp - limit with @xmath84 correspond to the lp - relaxed approximate solutions with minimum half - integral variables . in the three - state limit with @xmath187 ,",
    "the ground states are not constructed by the extreme - point solutions which are unsuitable for the lp - relaxed solution .",
    "the rs solution in the lp - limit is stable for the arbitrary average degree .",
    "therefore , the lp - limit solution coincides with the numerical result .",
    "however , the rs solution in the ip - limit is unstable above @xmath199 .",
    "in fact the lp relaxation fails to approximate optimal solutions above the critical threshold .",
    "we also discuss the case of the min - hs , min - vcs on @xmath0-uniform hypergraphs . because the min - hs has no half - integrality , the lp  ip model with three - state ising",
    "is insufficient for describing the lp relaxation of the min - hs .",
    "it is , however , worth studying the lp  ip model for a half - integer relaxed problem toward an understanding of the lp relaxation .",
    "it is particularly interesting that the rs solution in the lp limit is still stable below the critical threshold of the min - hs .",
    "this stability suggests that the original problem is stable against addition of the half - integral variables to its solution . above the threshold ,",
    "the analytic estimation by the rs solution in the lp - limit deviates from the optimal value of the original problem .",
    "the rs solution is simultaneously unstable , meaning the emergence of the rsb solutions .",
    "this fact implies that the half - integer relaxed problem decreases the value of the cost function from the original problem but it is still typically difficult to solve . in fact , lp - relaxed approximate solutions obtained using the numerical simulations include not only half integers but also other real values .",
    "these results suggest that the lp - relaxed min - hs typically fails to approximate the original problem in the rsb region .",
    "one of the striking facts obtained through our analysis is that , in the case of @xmath1 , the minimum half - integral ratio @xmath188 has the same mathematical expression as the lr core  @xcite .",
    "it strongly suggests that a common graph structure is the origin of the wrong estimation in two different approximation algorithms , which is unfortunately not identified .",
    "a key ingredient of the graph structure may be the core , in which there exist entangled odd long cycles and clustering of the optimal solutions occurs  @xcite . in min-@xmath209-xorsat ,",
    "a @xmath209-core is also regarded as a trigger for the typical hardness@xcite .",
    "then , it is naively expected that some graph structures will be a cause of both the replica symmetry breaking and the typical hardness in other combinatorial optimization problems . as for min - hss , in contrast",
    ", it is an open problem whether the minimum non - integral ratio is related to the core ratio . in general , the relation between an emergence of some graph structures and the rs / rsb transition is thus still to be revealed .",
    "it is interesting to consider the rsb picture more generally from the perspective of graph topology .    in this paper",
    ", we utilize the half - integrality for constructing the lp  ip model .",
    "recently , from the view of discrete convexity , bisubmodular relaxation which is equivalent to the lp relaxation with half - integrality is proposed  @xcite .",
    "it is related closely to an approximation tequnique previously known as the roof duality .",
    "it has been applied to more general approximation called generalized roof duality in optimization and inference  @xcite . because variables in a relaxed problem take @xmath210 , the lp  ip model and its analyses in this paper are applicable to the relaxation .",
    "statistical - mechanical approaches will be of help to elucidate a typical property of these schemes theoretically .",
    "we have demonstrated statistical  mechanical analysis of the typical behavior of an approximation algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "particularly , we emphasize on the lp relaxation based on the simplex method , which searches extreme points of a polytope generated by constraints .",
    "we construct effective model as the lp  ip model by extending the degree of freedom of spins and adding a penalty term to a conventional hard - core lattice gas model for the min - vc . within the framework of the lp relaxation ,",
    "theoretical standard model is necessary for the relaxed problems without the half - integrality and also for other solvers such as a cutting - plane approach  @xcite .",
    "another task is a statistical  mechanical study on other relaxations proposed in the literature of mathematical optimization .",
    "these analyses are expected to be helpful to provide conjecuters related to the average complexity of optimization problems in theoretical computer science and probability theory .",
    "we hope that they are useful to investigate the deep relation between the spin - glass theory and optimization problems .",
