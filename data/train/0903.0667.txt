    "one of the primary goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a proton - proton collider with a center of mass energy @xmath2  tev , will be to investigate the sector responsible for the breaking of the electroweak symmetry . in the standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "a single higgs doublet is responsible for the spontaneous breakdown of the @xmath3 gauge group to @xmath4 .",
    "the coupling constants of the sole physical higgs scalar to the rest of the sm particles are completely determined by their masses , and consequently there is little guesswork involved in determining the most promising channels  @xcite in which one might hope to discover such a scalar . for a relatively light ( @xmath5 ) sm higgs boson ,",
    "those channels are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , while for an intermediate - mass ( @xmath8 ) higgs , the single most promising channel is the weak - boson fusion ( wbf )  @xcite process @xmath9  @xcite . for a heavier higgs , with @xmath10 , the most relevant channels are @xmath11 and @xmath12 , with the higgs produced via either gluon fusion or wbf  @xcite .    in models where the higgs sector differs significantly from that of the standard model , however , the situation can change dramatically .",
    "this is true even in cases where the low - energy effective theory describing a given model at the weak scale contains only a single , light , @xmath0-even higgs scalar .",
    "indeed , at low energies , many models with extended higgs sectors have effective descriptions that are `` standard - model - like '' in the sense that they contain a single light higgs boson , but one whose couplings to the standard model fermions and gauge bosons differ  potentially significantly  from those of a sm higgs .",
    "such discrepancies , in turn , can translate into vast differences in lhc phenomenology : some ( or , in severe cases , even all ) of the standard detection channels for a sm higgs may disappear as a result of such modifications , while others , related to processes buried beneath background in the sm , may become crucial for discovery .",
    "one set of channels which are not terribly significant for the discovery of a sm higgs , but could become so in models with modified higgs sectors , consists of those involving direct decays of the higgs boson to a pair of high-@xmath13 leptons . in the sm ,",
    "a light higgs boson ( with mass @xmath14  gev ) decays predominantly into @xmath15 , and the ratio @xmath16 ( where @xmath17 ) is roughly proportional to @xmath18 , due to the fact that in the sm , the same higgs doublet is responsible for giving mass to both quarks and leptons .",
    "consequently , attention has been focussed predominately on processes in which the higgs boson decays to a tau pair ( with a branching ratio of about 10% ) , and in particular on the weak - boson fusion process @xmath9 .",
    "this is the only process particularly relevant for sm higgs discovery in which the higgs decays directly to leptons , though it is now regarded as one of the most promising discovery channels for a sm higgs in the intermediate mass region  @xcite .",
    "searching for the higgs in the @xmath19 and @xmath20 channels is more difficult , due to a combination of factors , including enhanced sm backgrounds and suppressed signal cross - sections .",
    "by contrast , processes in which a sm higgs boson decays into first- or second - generation leptons are generally assumed to be irrelevant for discovery . this is because under the assumption of yukawa - coupling universality among the lepton generations ( an assumption we will be making throughout the present work ) , the small size of @xmath21 compared to @xmath22 results in @xmath23 being roughly two orders of magnitude smaller than @xmath24 , with @xmath25 nearly three orders of magnitude smaller still . consequently , the rates for processes involving @xmath26 and @xmath27 are extremely suppressed relative to those involving tau pairs , both in the sm and in most simple extensions of the higgs sector . on the other hand ,",
    "there are strong motivations for considering processes of this sort at the lhc .",
    "experimentally , a signal involving a pair of high-@xmath28 muons or electrons will be easy to identify , as the muon- and electron - identification efficiencies at each of the lhc detectors are each greater than 90%@xcite .",
    "furthermore , once a higgs boson is discovered in these channels , its mass could be readily reconstructed with high precision .",
    "such channels could also be of use in determining the higgs yukawa couplings to leptons .",
    "two - higgs - doublet models ( 2hdm ) , which stand as perhaps the simplest , most tractable example of a non - minimal electroweak - symmetry - breaking sector , provide a useful context in which to study the role of leptonic higgs - decay processes .",
    "these models arise in a number of beyond - the - standard - model contexts from supersymmetry to little higgs scenarios  @xcite and have a rich phenomenology , many of whose consequences for lhc physics are still being uncovered . in general ,",
    "2hdm can be categorized according to how the higgs doublets couple to the sm quarks and leptons . in what has become known as a type  i 2hdm",
    ", one doublet is responsible for the masses of both quarks and leptons , while the other decouples from the fermions entirely . in a type  ii 2hdm , one higgs doublet couples to the up - type quark sector , while the other higgs doublet couples to both the down - type quark sector and the charged leptons  as is the case , for example , in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in both of these standard scenarios , the leptonic branching ratios for",
    "a light higgs do not differ much from their sm values throughout most of parameter space coupling is suppressed due to radiative corrections  @xcite , and consequently @xmath29 becomes large .",
    "] , since the same doublet gives masses to both the bottom quark and the charged leptons .    one interesting alternative possibility , which will be the primary focus of the present work , is a 2hdm scenario in which one higgs doublet couples exclusively to ( both up- and down - type ) quarks , while the other couples exclusively to leptons  a scenario which we will henceforth dub the leptophilic two - higgs - doublet model ( l2hdm ) .",
    "this model has been discussed previously in the literature in relation to its effect on higgs branching fractions and decay widths  @xcite , flavor physics  @xcite , and potential implications for neutrino phenomenology  @xcite and dark matter studies  @xcite .",
    "some analyses of the lhc phenomenology of the model were presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , which focused on the non - decoupling region of the parameter space where additional physical higgs scalars are light .    in this work ,",
    "we discuss the leptonic decays of the lightest @xmath0-even higgs scalar in the l2hdm at the lhc .",
    "in particular , we examine the discovery potential in a decoupling regime in which only one light scalar , which resembles the sm higgs , appears in the low - energy effective description of the model .",
    "we begin in section  [ sec : param ] by presenting the model and reviewing how the coupling structure of the lightest neutral higgs particle is modified from that of a sm higgs . in section  [ sec : bounds ] , we discuss the applicable experimental constraints from flavor physics , direct searches , etc .  and show that they still permit substantial deviations in the couplings between the higgs boson and the other sm fields away from their standard - model values . in section  [ sec : brxsec ] , we discuss the implications of such modifications on the higgs branching ratios and production rates . in section  [ sec : lhcsignatures ] , we discuss potential higgs discovery channels in which the higgs boson decays directly into a pair of charged leptons , and in section  [ sec : combined ] , we calculate the discovery potential for a light , leptophilic higgs using the combined results from all of these leptonic channels . in section",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] we conclude .",
    "the l2hdm , as defined here , is a modification of the sm in which the higgs sector consists of two @xmath3 scalar doublets , both of which receive nonzero vacuum expectation values .",
    "the first of these doublets , which we call @xmath30 , couples only to ( both up- and down - type ) quarks , while the other , which we call @xmath31 , couples only to leptons .",
    "in other words , the yukawa interaction lagrangian is specified to be @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 are @xmath36 yukawa matrixes , @xmath37 and @xmath38 respectively denote the left - handed quark and lepton fields , @xmath39 and @xmath40 respectively denote the right - handed up- and down - type quark fields , and @xmath41 denotes the right - handed lepton fields .",
    "this coupling structure can be achieved by imposing a @xmath42 symmetry under which @xmath43 and @xmath41 are odd , while all the other fields in the model are even .",
    "we will assume that this symmetry is broken only softly , by a term of the form @xmath44 in the scalar potential .    in the l2hdm , that scalar potential takes the usual form common to all two - higgs doublet models .",
    "assuming that there is no @xmath0-violation in the higgs sector , this potential can be parameterized as follows  @xcite : @xmath45\\label{eq : vstandard}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] it is assumed that the parameters of the theory are assigned such that both @xmath30 and @xmath43 acquire nonzero vevs ( which we respectively denote @xmath46 and @xmath47 ) , and that @xmath48 .",
    "we define @xmath49 as @xmath50 so that large @xmath49 corresponds to small @xmath47 , and therefore to large intrinsic lepton yukawa couplings . in the broken phase of the theory , the spectrum of the model includes the three massless goldstone modes which become the longitudinal modes of the @xmath51 and @xmath52 bosons , as well as five massive scalar degrees of freedom : two @xmath0-even fields @xmath53 and @xmath54 , a pseudoscalar @xmath55 , and a pair of charged fields @xmath56 .",
    "the relationship between the physical @xmath0-even higgs scalars @xmath53 , @xmath54 and the real , neutral degrees of freedom in @xmath30 and @xmath43 is parameterized by the mixing angle @xmath57 : @xmath58\\\\    \\mathrm{re}[\\phi_q^0-v_q]\\end{array}\\right ) .",

    "since the potential given in eqn .",

    "what follows , it will be useful to work in a different , more physically meaningful basis for these parameters : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 are the masses of the corresponding physical higgs scalars .",
    "in order to study the collider phenomenology of the l2hdm , it will be necessary to characterize how the effective couplings between @xmath53 and the sm fields differ from their sm values .",

    "when @xmath86 and @xmath87 are complex ( which occurs when @xmath88 ) , it corresponds to internal lines going on shell .",
    "this allows us to define a scaling factor for each of these effective vertices : @xmath89 since @xmath90 has an overall @xmath91 prefactor ( from the @xmath92 ) , the contribution from top quarks running in the loops will still dominate over the contribution from leptons unless @xmath93 ; thus the lepton loops generally can be neglected .",
    "it is worth noting that since the effective higgs - gluon - gluon coupling receives contributions solely from quark loops , @xmath94 to leading order in @xmath95 , whereas @xmath96 depends on @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and @xmath99 in a nontrivial way .",
    "the mixing angles @xmath57 and @xmath70 are constrained by several theoretical consistency conditions , as well as a number of experimental constraints .",
    "we will put off discussion of the latter until section  [ sec : bounds ] and focus on the former .",
    "first of all , we require that the higgs sector not be strongly coupled , in the sense that all @xmath59 may be considered perturbatively small ( i.e.  @xmath100 for all @xmath101 ) and that the @xmath102-matrix satisfies all relevant tree - unitarity constraints .",
    "this implies that the quartic couplings @xmath59 appearing in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : vstandard ] ) must satisfy  @xcite @xmath103 perturbativity constraints also apply to the yukawa couplings @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 appearing in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : yuks ] ) , which are modified from their sm values according to eqn .",
    "( [ eq : hffcouplings ] ) .",
    "however , since @xmath104 and @xmath105 are suppressed relative to their sm values rather than enhanced when @xmath107 ( the case of interest here ) , no stringent constraints arise on account of such modifications .",
    "in addition to these perturbativity constraints , we must also require that the scalar potential given in eqn .",
    "( [ eq : vstandard ] ) is finite at large field values and contains no flat directions .",
    "these considerations translate into the bounds  @xcite @xmath108    in this work , we will be primarily interested in examining situations in which the additional physical scalars @xmath56 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 are heavy enough to `` decouple '' from the collider phenomenology of the theory in the sense that the only observable signals of beyond - the - standard - model physics at the lhc at low luminosity involve the light @xmath0-even scalar @xmath53 . for our present purposes , it will be sufficient to define our `` decoupling regime '' by the condition that @xmath109 , where @xmath110 is some high scale .",
    "of course this regime includes the strict decoupling limit in which @xmath111 and the mixing angles satisfy the condition @xmath112 .",
    "however , it also includes substantial regions of parameter space within which the values of @xmath57 and @xmath70 deviate significantly from this relationship .",
    "3.5 truein    the extent of parameter space allowed according to our definition of the decoupling regime is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinatanbexcl ] .",
    "this figure shows the decoupling regions of @xmath113 - @xmath49 parameter space in which all of the aforementioned constraints are satisfied for a variety of different values of @xmath110 .",
    "contours corresponding to @xmath114  gev , @xmath115  gev , and @xmath116  tev are displayed , along with a dash - dotted line representing the pure decoupling limit , where @xmath117 and @xmath112 .",
    "the contours in fig .",
    "[ fig : sinatanbexcl ] were obtained by fixing @xmath66 to a particular value ( @xmath118  gev ) and surveying over the remaining parameters . a given combination of @xmath113 and @xmath49 is considered to be `` allowed '' in this sense as long as there exists some combination of model parameters for which @xmath109 , and for which all of the constraints in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : pertbounds ] ) and  ( [ eq : vacstabbounds ] ) are simultaneously satisfied .",
    "it is readily apparent from the figure that sizable regions of parameter space exist within which all constraints are satisfied , yet the masses of all scalars other than @xmath53 are large enough to effectively decouple from the low - energy effective description of the model .",
    "it is also apparent that for @xmath119  tev , the decoupling region , as we have defined it , approaches the pure decoupling limit .",
    "2.1 truein 2.1 truein 2.1 truein    it is interesting to inquire to what extent the effective higgs couplings can be modified in the decoupling regime without running afoul of the aforementioned constraints . in the three panels shown in fig .  [ fig : sinatanbetacont ] we plot a number of contours in @xmath113 - @xmath49 parameter space corresponding to different values of @xmath120 ( left ) , @xmath97 ( center ) and @xmath121 ( right ) . on each panel , we have also superimposed the @xmath122  gev contour from fig .  [",
    "fig : sinatanbexcl ] .",
    "it is evident from these plots that while @xmath123 in the @xmath111 limit , large regions of parameter space are still allowed in the decoupling regime within these @xmath74-factors can deviate substantially from unity .",
    "the message , then , is that the effective couplings of a light higgs boson in the decoupling regime do not have to approximate those which correspond to the pure decoupling limit , in which they approach those of a sm higgs . on the contrary , a wide variety of possibilities for the mixing angles @xmath57 and @xmath70 are still open in this regime , and as we shall soon see , many of these possibilities have a dramatic effect on in the collider phenomenology of the scalar @xmath53 .",
    "in addition to the perturbativity and vacuum - stability bounds discussed in the previous section , the l2hdm is constrained by additional considerations related to flavor - physics experiment , direct searches , etc .",
    "we now proceed to investigate these constraints in an effort to show that they can easily be satisfied in the decoupling regime  even in the region of parameter space most interesting for collider phenomenology , where @xmath49 is large and @xmath113 deviates substantially from zero .    let us begin with those bounds related to direct searches for beyond - the - standard - model scalars at lep . the current direct detection bounds",
    "( at 95% cl ) for the masses of charged and neutral @xmath0-odd higgs bosons , as reported by the particle data group  @xcite , are @xmath124 and @xmath125 . these clearly present no problem for the model in the decoupling limit considered here .    far more stringent constraints on models with more than one higgs doublet can be derived , however , from experimental limits on flavor - violating processes that receive contributions at the one - loop level from diagrams involving charged higgs bosons .",
    "let us first consider flavor violation in the lepton sector , which is constrained by analyses of @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 conversion in nuclei . in the absence of neutrino masses ,",
    "the matrix of effective @xmath130 couplings is proportional to the charged - lepton mass matrix ; hence there is no additional source of lepton - flavor violation ( lfv ) . in the presence of neutrino masses",
    "this is no longer true , and nonzero contributions to lfv processes arise at one loop due to diagrams with charged higgs bosons running in the loop .",
    "however , it has been shown  @xcite that the resultant flavor - violating amplitudes are several orders of magnitude below current experimental bounds .",
    "therefore , even in cases in which the effective @xmath131 coupling receives a substantial @xmath49-enhancement factor , such sources of lfv will not present any phenomenological difficulties .",
    "now let us turn to consider the situation in the quark sector , where , by contrast , flavor - violation rates can be sizeable .",
    "this is because the effective @xmath132 couplings in two - higgs - doublet models include flavor - violating terms proportional to the off - diagonal elements of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xmath133 : @xmath134d_jh^+     -\\frac{\\tan\\beta}{v}m_{e_i}\\bar{\\nu}_i p_r e_ih^+    + h.c.,\\ ] ] as a result , such models are constrained by experimental bounds on @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , @xmath138 , rare kaon decays , etc . , which translate into bounds on the model parameters relevant to the charged - scalar sector : @xmath69 and @xmath49 .",
    "since the flavor mixing in the charged higgs couplings to the quark sector is proportional to @xmath139 , it is the region where both @xmath49 and @xmath69 are small which is most tightly constrained by these bounds .",
    "the most stringent constraints are those associated with @xmath140 and with mixing in the @xmath141 and @xmath142 systems . in the l2hdm , the same higgs doublet couples to both up- and down - type quarks , just as it does in type  i 2hdm  @xcite ; hence the bounds on @xmath69 and @xmath49 due to flavor mixing in the quark sector will be essentially identical to those applicable in type  i models .",

    "<S> in this work , we examine a two - higgs - doublet extension of the standard model in which one higgs doublet is responsible for giving mass to both up- and down - type quarks , while a separate doublet is responsible for giving mass to leptons . </S>",
    "<S> we examine both the theoretical and experimental constraints on the model and show that large regions of parameter space are allowed by these constraints in which the effective couplings between the lightest neutral higgs scalar and the standard - model leptons are substantially enhanced . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the collider phenomenology of such a `` leptophilic '' two - higgs - doublet model and show that in cases where the low - energy spectrum contains only one light , @xmath0-even scalar , a variety of collider processes essentially irrelevant for the discovery of a standard model higgs boson ( specifically those in which the higgs boson decays directly into a charged - lepton pair ) can contribute significantly to the discovery potential of a light - to - intermediate - mass ( @xmath1  gev ) higgs boson at the lhc . </S>"
