    "planetary nebulae ( pne ) represent the final phases of the stellar evolution of low- and intermediate - mass stars .",
    "the shape of a pn is thought to be determined by the interaction of the current fast , tenuous stellar wind ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) of its central star with the previous slow , dense wind of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) phase . in the so - called interacting stellar winds ( isw )",
    "model of pn formation @xcite , the critical parameter is the density distribution of the agb wind @xcite : a spherical symmetric agb wind will result in a spherical pn , while a polar density gradient in the agb wind will result in an elliptical or bipolar pn , depending on the degree of the density gradient",
    ".    this simplified view of pn formation has been challenged by the overwhelming body of observations of pne showing small - scale features ( e.g. , ngc7662 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , collimated bipolar outflows ( e.g. , ngc7009 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and point - symmetric morphologies , including multiple point - symmetric bubbles ( e.g. , hen2 - 47 and m1 - 37 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and point - symmetric collimated outflows ( e.g. , ngc6884 , * ? ? ?",
    "all these features are difficult to interpret in the framework of the isw model and have inspired new theoretical ideas to explain the shaping of pne .",
    "new scenarios of pne formation and shaping include magnetic collimation @xcite , the action of collimated fast winds @xcite , or the blowing up of a warped circumstellar disk by the fast stellar wind @xcite .",
    "@xcite recognized a new morphological class of pne characterized by the point - symmetry with respect to their centers .",
    "the morphology of these pne suggests that they are shaped by a mechanism involving precession , most likely the action of precessing or rotating collimated outflows .",
    "an investigation of pne with point - symmetric morphologies is , thus , essential to evaluate the action of precessing collimated outflows in the formation of pne and to assess the origin of the collimating mechanisms . among the pne with point - symmetric morphology",
    ", ic4634 is an outstanding case .",
    "ic4634 is an archetypical point - symmetric pn as @xcite found that its remarkable double - s - shaped morphology is reflected in its kinematics : each component of the two s - shaped features expands radially with its counterpart on the other side of the star expanding in opposite direction .",
    "the collimated outflows of ic4634 are further revealed by bow shock features indicating their interaction with the surrounding medium .",
    "therefore , both the morphology and kinematics of ic4634 suggest the presence of highly symmetric fast collimated outflows , and the precession or rotation of the source that produced them .    since the study of ic4634 by @xcite ,",
    "several studies have further investigated the kinematical and morphological properties of ic4634 @xcite , but a detailed study is lacking . in this paper , we present a spatio - kinematical study of ic4634 using narrow - band archival _ hst _ wfpc2 and ground - based images and complementary long - slit echelle and medium - dispersion spectroscopic observations . the observations , described in @xmath22 , have allowed us to investigate the morphology , kinematics , and physical conditions of ic4634 and the possible shock excitation of the bow shock features .",

    "the detailed morphology and kinematics of the bow shock structures _ a - a@xmath17 _ and _ b - b@xmath17 _ of ic4634 can be unambiguously ascribed to a precessing fast collimated outflow , and the morphology and ionization of the bow shock structures _",
    "c - c@xmath17 _ are reminiscent of the interaction of a fast , dense bullet with the nebular material . in view of these findings , it is worthwhile to revisit other cases of bow shocks in pne .",
    "so far , the best studied case of a bow shock in a pn is that of ic4593 @xcite . in this nebula",
    ", we find several systems of knots and inward facing tails that have been interpreted as multiple collimated outflows propagating along different directions .",
    "these knots are preceded by outward facing caps with bow shock morphologies .",
    "the bow shock structures in ic4593 share many similarities with those of ic4634 . both have low radial velocities ,",
    "show a decrease in the observed radial velocity and the broadening of the emission profile , and display caps of enhanced [ o  iii ] emission as expected in bow shock models .",
    "all these properties suggest the motion of medium velocity jets near the plane of the sky that are interacting with the surrounding material .",
    "the _ ansae _ of ngc7009 are another promising example of fast , dense bullets ramming through the outer shells of the nebula .",
    "this interpretation was questioned as the ionization state of the gas declines at the head of the bow shock @xcite , while the opposite is expected in bow shocks @xcite . however",
    ", the observed ionization gradient can be reproduced by the numerical simulations of a shocked cloudlet moving away from the central star if the stellar ionizing photon flux , which modifies the ionization and excitation structure of the shock , is included @xcite . in their study of ic4593 bow shocks , @xcite noted that the ionizing flux from the central star can play a predominant role in the ionization stratification of bow shocks in pne . at any rate , an examination of a deep _ hst _",
    "wfpc2 [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 ratio map of ngc7009 reveals that the _ ansae _ of ngc7009 are preceded by caps of enhanced [ o  iii ] as expected in bow shocks @xcite .",
    "besides ic4593 , ic4634 , and ngc7009 , there are very few other cases of bow shock associated with pne .",
    "the [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 ratio image of ngc6543 @xcite shows a bow shock structure enveloping the precessing - like collimated outflows along the polar directions of this nebula @xcite , although this structure is not discussed in detail .",
    "a bow shock structure has also been described in ngc6572 , although the limited spatial resolution of ground - based images do not allow the authors to study the ionization stratification at the bow shock @xcite .",
    "a comprehensive investigation of the occurrence of bow shocks associated with the expansion of fast collimated outflows or bullets in pne is in progress @xcite .",
    "our spatio - kinematical study of ic4634 has revealed new structural components in this nebula , including what seems to be the relic of ancient precessing collimated ejections , a triple shell morphology , and a thin skin of enhanced [ o  iii]/h@xmath1 enveloping the nebula and the bow shock structures at the tip of the collimated outflows .",
    "furthermore , the _ hst _ images and ground - based echelle spectroscopy provide a detailed view of the physical structure of the bow shock associated with a collimated outflow in a pn .",
    "their morphology and kinematics have been successfully modeled using hydro - dynamical simulations in which a precessing fast collimated outflow interacts with nebular material .",
    "ic4634 seems to have experienced a series of mildly asymmetric mass loss episodes that have removed the stellar envelope , yielding to the current fast stellar wind .",
    "these periods of mass loss are interspersed with two episodic ejections of collimated outflows that have interacted with the nebular material , having important consequences in the shaping of ic4634 .",
    "the most recent episode of ejection of collimated outflows is directly responsible of the formation of the bow shock structures _ a - a@xmath17 _ , _ b - b@xmath17 _ , and _ c - c@xmath17 _ within the envelope , and has played a significant role in the asymmetry and orientation of the inner shell .",
    "the probable interaction of this collimated outflow with circumstellar material might be linked to the formation of _ d - d@xmath17_. finally , the oldest episode of ejection of collimated outflows formed _",
    "h _ and _ hd _ in the outermost regions .",
    "the two ejections of collimated outflows took place at different times during the pn formation . the large misalignment between the ejection axes of the collimated outflows giving",
    "raise to _ a - a@xmath17 _ , _ b - b@xmath17 _ , and _ c - c@xmath17 _ , on one hand , and _",
    "h _ and _ hd _ , on the other , imply that the collimating source had experienced important changes between the ejections .",
    "the data presented here have been taken using alfosc , which is owned by the instituto de astrofsica de andaluca ( iaa ) and operated at the nordic optical telescope under agreement between iaa and the nbifafg of the astronomical observatory of copenhagen .",
