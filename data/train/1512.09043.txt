    "the celebrated zaanen - sawatzky - allen ( zsa ) classification scheme @xcite divides strongly correlated insulators , such as transition metal oxides ( tmos ) , into two broad categories : charge transfer or mott - hubbard insulators .",
    "two fundamental energy scales determine the boundary between these categories .",
    "the first is the coulomb repulsion @xmath0 associated with the transition - metal ( tm ) cation site , which parameterizes the energy cost for ( @xmath3)-type charge excitations .",
    "the second is the charge transfer energy @xmath1 associated with ( d@xmath4)-type charge excitations , where a hole moves from the cation site to the ligand anions l. when these atomic energy scales dominate over electron itinerancy , the emerging insulator is of the charge transfer type when @xmath5 and of the mott - hubbard type when @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "determining which factors set the magnitude of these scales is important for the most basic understanding of the behavior of tmos . in an ionic picture , the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath0 sets the splitting of the lower and upper hubbard bands @xcite , while the charge transfer energy @xmath7 is typically set by the relative electronegativity of the oxygen ( o ) anions and the ionization energy of the tm cation @xcite .",
    "as such , copper oxides are typically classified as charge transfer insulators , where their conduction band is derived from the copper ( cu ) states forming the upper hubbard band , while the valence band is derived from the o @xmath8 states .",
    "this dichotomy creates a fundamental asymmetry between electron and hole doping processes , as reflected for example in the phase diagram of the high - temperature superconducting cuprates @xcite .    properly classifying a real material",
    "is a challenging task experimentally .",
    "one needs to be able to determine the size of @xmath1 and @xmath0 in the presence of complications such as hybridization effects and additional interactions .",
    "resonant inelastic x - ray scattering ( rixs ) is a powerful spectroscopic tool in this context @xcite .",
    "it is capable of directly probing charge @xcite , orbital @xcite , spin @xcite , and , as most recently discovered , lattice excitations @xcite .",
    "the observation of the latter is particularly exciting , as rixs can access the electron - phonon ( e - ph ) coupling strengths directly @xcite , and with element specificity @xcite .",
    "this opens a direct means to study the influence of lattice dynamics on the fundamental electronic energy scales .    in this work",
    "we perform such a study for the edge - shared charge transfer insulator li@xmath2cuo@xmath2 ( lco ) in order to determine how the e - ph interaction helps to shape the charge transfer energy in this quasi - one - dimensional spin - chain cuprate .",
    "the active electronic degrees of freedom in lco are formed from edge - shared cuo@xmath9 plaquettes with a central cu 3@xmath10 cation @xcite . as a result , lco harbors zhang - rice singlet ( zrs ) charge excitons similar to those found in the high - t@xmath11 cuprates @xcite .",
    "the e - ph interaction is also expected to play a role in this system .",
    "this was recently demonstrated for the related edge - shared cuprate ca@xmath12y@xmath13cu@xmath14o@xmath15 ( cyco ) , where charge carriers couple strongly to cu - o bond stretching phonon modes polarized perpendicular to the chain direction @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate here that a similar e - ph interaction occurs in lco .",
    "more importantly , however , we show that this interaction provides a substantial contribution to @xmath1 , accounting for @xmath16 of its total value .",
    "this result is obtained from a comprehensive analysis of high - resolution oxygen k - edge rixs @xcite data that resolves individual phonon , @xmath17 , and charge transfer excitations ( including the zrs exciton ) .",
    "this in turn allows us to disentangle the elementary spin , charge , orbital , and lattice excitations over an energy range of @xmath18 ev . if the e - ph interaction is omitted in our analysis , the spectra imply a value @xmath19 ev ; however , when the e - ph interaction is properly accounted for , this value separates into a purely electronic contribution of @xmath20 ev and a very substantial phononic contribution of about the same size @xmath21 ev . as such , the elementary excitations across the charge transfer gap in lco couple strongly to specific phonon modes , enhancing their total energy cost .",
    "this result places the basic classification of lco in a new light , where the relevant energy scales are shaped not only by the local chemistry of the atoms but also dynamically by interactions with phonons that are relevant for many tmos @xcite .",
    "* rixs at the oxygen k - edge in li@xmath22cuo@xmath22 *  the oxygen k - edge rixs process is sketched in fig .",
    "1 . during the experiment , photons with energy @xmath23 and momentum @xmath24",
    "are absorbed by the system in its initial state @xmath25 via an o @xmath26 dipole transition .",
    "this creates an intermediate state @xmath27 with an o @xmath28 core hole and an additional electron in the conduction band .",
    "the resulting intermediate state then evolves in time under the influence of the core - hole potential and the excited electronic configuration .",
    "a number of elementary excitations are created in the system during this time until the core hole decays , emitting an outgoing photon ( momentum @xmath29 and energy @xmath30 ) and leaving the system in an excited final state @xmath31 .    in order to understand how the e - ph interaction enters this process",
    "it is important to examine further the states involved .",
    "the electronic ground state in lco , and other spin - chain cuprates , is largely of @xmath32 character , where @xmath33 denotes a hole on the ligand o. this state , however , couples strongly to cu - o bond - stretching phonons like the transverse mode sketched in fig .",
    "this coupling can occur in two ways .",
    "for instance , the bond - stretching modes directly modulate the cu - o hopping integral .",
    "alternatively , these modes can modulate the madelung energy of the central cu atom , effectively lowering / raising the energy of the cu site as the o atoms move closer to / further from it .",
    "this latter mechanism can not be effectively screened in lower dimensions , and turns out to be the relevant coupling mechanism for our analysis @xcite .",
    "since the electronic contribution to charge transfer energy ( in hole language ) in this system is @xmath34 , we can view the phonon modes as modulating the charge transfer energy @xcite .",
    "this is confirmed in fig 1c , where we plot the linear variation in @xmath35 obtained from a static point charge model under uniform expansions / compressions of the cuo plaquettes in the direction perpendicular to the chain ( see methods ) .",
    "the physical interpretation of this result is as follows .",
    "the lighter o atoms , in an effort to eliminate the first order e - ph coupling and minimize the energy of the system , shift to new equilibrium positions located closer towards the cu atoms .",
    "subsequently , the new ground state of the system involves a coherent state of phonon quanta @xmath36 that describes the distorted structure .",
    "the new equilibrium positions also produce changes in the madelung energy of the cu site , increasing the charge transfer energy in comparison to the value obtained in the absence of the interaction .",
    "this renormalization of the charge transfer energy is a bulk property of the crystal arising from the e - ph interaction with the cu 3@xmath10 hole present in the ground state . as such",
    ", it will manifest in many bulk spectroscopies including rixs ( this work ) , optical conductivity , and inelastic neutron scattering ( see supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "it is important to note , however , that this renormalization is inherently dynamic , as the oxygen atoms are free to respond to changes in cu hole density .",
    "this has observable consequences in the rixs spectra , as we now demonstrate .",
    "the rixs process for lco s initial state dressed by the phonon excitations is sketched in fig 1b . at low temperatures",
    "it is now predominantly @xmath37 in character .",
    "the intermediate state is formed after the creation of a core hole on the o site , through an o @xmath26 transition .",
    "this creates an intermediate state of @xmath38 character , which corresponds to an upper hubbard band excitation , where the number of holes on the cu site has changed . in response",
    ", the ligand o atoms begin to relax towards new positions until the core hole decays .",
    "ultimately , this leaves the system in a final state with both excited electronic and lattice configurations @xmath39 .",
    "it is important to stress that here the core hole provides us with a lens through which we can view the e - ph interaction using rixs . it does not generate it . while the lattice excitations we probe are being generated in the intermediate state",
    ", they carry information about the strength of the e - ph interaction that is present in the initial and final states .",
    "the change in carrier density introduced by the creation of the core hole excites the lattice , but the way in which the lattice responds depends on strength and details of the interaction .     the presence of the e - ph interaction in lco is confirmed in our measured rixs spectra , shown in fig .",
    "2a . the x - ray absorption spectroscopy ( xas ) spectrum ( inset ) has a prominent peak centered at 529.7 ev , which corresponds to the discussed excitation into the upper hubbard band .",
    "the rixs spectra , taken with incident photons detuned slightly from this energy ( @xmath40 ev , indicated by the arrow ) , are rich .",
    "( here we have shown data detuned from the uhb resonance , since the intensity of the zrs excitation is largest for this incident photon energy @xcite . )",
    "we observe a number of features , including a long tail of intensity extending from the elastic line comprised of several phonon excitations ; two nearly t - independent peaks at @xmath41 and @xmath42 ev , which correspond to now well - known @xmath17 excitations @xcite ; a t - dependent peak at @xmath43 ev , which corresponds to a zhang - rice singlet excitation @xcite ; and , finally , a band of charge transfer ( ct ) excitations for @xmath44 . in this case , we are using the term ct excitation as an umbrella term for any excitation where a cu @xmath45 hole has been transferred to the o @xmath8 orbitals , with the exception of the zrs excitation . as such , ct excitations include the florescence excitations .",
    "we have explicitly confirmed each of these identifications by examining the character of the final state wave functions obtained from our model calculations .",
    "the phonon excitations are more apparent in the high - resolution measurements of the quasi - elastic and @xmath17 excitation energy range , shown in figs .",
    "2d and 2f , respectively .",
    "we observe clear harmonic phonon excitations separated in energy by @xmath46 mev , consistent with those reported for cyco @xcite .",
    "this demonstrates that the e - ph coupling is a common phenomenon in the spin chain cuprates .",
    "another important aspect of the data is the positions of the zrs and ct excitations , which are determined by the charge transfer energy . from the data we infer @xmath47 ev , which is significantly larger than the 3.2 ev obtained from madelung energy estimates based solely on local chemistry considerations @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be accounted for by including the bond - stretching phonons implied by the observed harmonic excitations in figs 2d and 2f .",
    " we assessed the phonon contribution to @xmath1 by modeling the rixs spectra within the kramers - heisenberg formalism @xcite .",
    "the initial , intermediate , and final states were obtained from small cluster exact diagonalization ( ed ) calculations that included the lattice degrees of freedom @xcite . the electronic model and its parameters are the same as those used in a previous lco study @xcite , however , we have extended this model to include additional cu @xmath45 orbitals and kept the bare charge transfer energy @xmath34 as a fitting parameter .",
    "this number represents the size of the charge transfer energy in the absence of the e - ph interaction .",
    "the model for the lattice degrees of freedom is similar to ref . @xcite but with an e - ph coupling strength parameterized by @xmath48 and the phonon energy @xmath49 mev , as determined from our data ( see methods ) .",
    "the calculated spectra are shown in fig . 2b , 2e , and 2 g , where we have set @xmath50 ev and @xmath51 ev .",
    "this choice produces the best global agreement between the theory and experiment both in terms of the positions of the ct and zrs excitations , as well as the intensities of the harmonic excitations in the @xmath17 and quasi - elastic regions .",
    "we also stress that the remaining parameters of the model were held fixed during our fitting procedure , as their values are heavily constrained by optical conductivity @xcite , eels @xcite , inelastic neutron scattering @xcite , and rixs ( this work and ref .",
    "@xcite ) measurements .    a closer inspection of fig .",
    "2b reveals our main finding : the observed positions of the zrs and ct excitations are not set by the purely electronic value of @xmath52 ev but rather the total @xmath53 ev with @xmath54 ev ( see methods ) . in other words ,",
    "the electron - lattice interaction is responsible for half of the effective charge transfer energy in lco . in order to stress this point , fig .",
    "2c shows results obtained from a similar model where the e - ph interaction is taken out of the analysis . in order to even qualitatively reproduce the positions of the zrs and ct excitations in this electronic - only model , @xmath35 must now be increased to 4.6 ev .",
    "furthermore , the phonon satellite peaks are absent in the quasi - elastic and @xmath17 excitation regions .",
    "this is a clear deficiency in the electronic - only model that is corrected only when the e - ph interaction is included .",
    "it is clear that the electron - lattice coupling plays a very significant role in establishing the effective value of @xmath1 in lco .",
    "we note that there is a small discrepancy between the theory and experiment ; namely , the relative intensity of the observed second phonon line with respect to the first one is slightly stronger than the one captured by the cluster calculation .",
    "while increasing the value of @xmath48 does increase the intensity of the second phonon excitation relative to the first @xcite , the single mode model we have adopted always produces a diminishing intensity in successive phonon excitations .",
    "( we have also examined nonlinear e - ph interactions but these are unable to account for this discrepancy . )",
    "we therefore speculate that increased intensity in the second phonon excitation is due to multi - phonon processes that can not be included in our calculations due to the necessary truncation of the phonon hilbert space ( see methods ) . for these reasons",
    ", we selected @xmath51 ev , which is consistent with the madelung energy considerations .",
    "this value also provides a conservative estimate for the lattice contribution to @xmath1 .    in fig .",
    "3 we compare the measured incident photon energy dependence to the predictions of the e - ph coupled model as an additional verification . here a resonance behavior in the experimental data is observed , where the phonon excitations emanating from the elastic line and @xmath17 excitations persist to higher energy losses as @xmath55 resonates with the upper hubbard band excitation in the xas .",
    "our experimental observations are in agreement with prior o @xmath56-edge measurements on the related cyco system @xcite .",
    "( in both materials , the observed resonance behavior is damped with respect to similar behavior observed in gas phase oxygen molecules @xcite .",
    "this is due to the increased number of core - hole decay channels present in the solid @xcite . )",
    "our model with the e - ph interaction reproduces these features well .",
    "in contrast , the electronic model without the electron - phonon coupling fails to capture these features .",
    "this underscores once more the importance of the e - ph interaction for understanding the rixs spectra on even the qualitative level .",
    "we have performed oxygen k - edge rixs measurements on the edge - shared 1d cuprate li@xmath2cuo@xmath2 , revealing clear phonon excitations in the rixs spectra .",
    "these excitations are well captured by a model that includes coupling to a cu - o bond - stretching optical phonon mode , which modulates the on - site energy of the cu orbitals and leads to a substantial renormalization of the effective charge transfer energy .",
    "this renormalization is not a simple effect related to the formation of the core hole .",
    "the non - zero e - ph interaction that we infer here is present in the system regardless of the existence of the core hole .",
    "thus the corresponding renormalization of the charge transfer energy will also be present in other spectroscopies such as optical conductivity @xcite , eels @xcite , and inelastic neutron scattering @xcite ( see supplementary note 1 ) .",
    "our results show that the electron - phonon interaction is of relevance to the zaanen - sawatzky - allen classification of this material , where the lattice contribution to the charge transfer energy accounts for nearly half of the total value .",
    "since the ensuing renormalizations can be very large in materials possessing substantial electron - phonon couplings , we expect that such considerations will prove to be important in other families of quasi - one - dimensional correlated systems , where the lattice motion can not be effectively screened .",
    "for example , the related spin chain system cyco likely has a large lattice contribution to the charge transfer energy .",

    "1c ) gives @xmath188 ev/@xmath189 , which yields @xmath131 ev .",
    "it should be stressed that this value of @xmath48 is an estimate based on a point charge model , however , it gives us an idea of the expected coupling strength .",
    " as discussed in the main text , in the ground state of the lco chain the oxygen atoms will shift to new equilibrium positions in response to the linear electron - phonon coupling terms of the hamiltonian .",
    "this situation can be qualitatively understood by introducing shifted phonon operators @xmath190 and @xmath191 , where @xmath192 is the average number of holes on the cu site in the ground state .",
    "these new operators yield a shifted atomic position given by @xmath193 .",
    "this shift of position is responsible for the renormalization of the charge transfer energy .",
    "after this transformation is made the phonon and electron - phonon coupled terms of the hamiltonian [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : e - ph ] ) ] reduce to @xmath194 where we have dropped an overall constant .",
    "the second term describes the coupling to the lattice in the new equilibrium position , which is proportional to the fluctuation in cu charge density from its ground state value .",
    "the third term can be folded into the definition of the cu site energy with @xmath195 .",
    "this gives an effective charge transfer energy @xmath196 where @xmath34 and @xmath197 . from these considerations",
    "one can also see that no isotope effect is predicted for @xmath198 , since both @xmath199 and @xmath200 are proportional to the inverse of the mass of oxygen .    ",
