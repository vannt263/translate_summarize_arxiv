    "the concept of _ compact galaxies _ was introduced by zwicky @xcite , who has described them as  galaxies barely distinguishable from stars \" on the palomar sky survey plates . the term blue compact dwarf ( bcd )",
    "galaxies @xcite identify those objects that show low luminosity , small linear dimensions , strong emission lines superposed on a blue continuum , and spectral properties that indicate low chemical abundances .",
    "bcds form a subset of hii galaxies , a large number of which have been identified on objective prism surveys by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite by the presence of strong emission lines , similar to giant hii regions ( ghiirs ) in our galaxy . here",
    ", we will refer to hii / bcd galaxies as objects with a metallicity 7.0@xmath112+log(o / h)@xmath18.4 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , low luminosity ( m@xmath2 @xmath3 -18 ) and gas - rich objects ( e.g. , @xcite ) undergoing vigorous starburst activity in a relatively small physical size ( @xmath41 kpc ) .",
    "the star - forming component , in these objects , typically contains multiple knots of star - formation with unresolved ensembles of young star clusters ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis of these systems being young , forming their first generation of stars has been discarded by the detection of an evolved underlying stellar host with an age @xmath51 gyr , in the majority of the nearby hii / bcd population ( e.g. , @xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the optical spectrum of the galaxy tol  2146 - 391 obtained using integral field unit ( ifu ) observations with gemini / gmos . in this figure",
    "we label the most important emission lines used in our studies , in particular , the strong balmer hydrogen recombination lines and collisionally excited emission lines , such as [ o ii ] @xmath63726,3729 , [ o iii ] @xmath04363 , [ o iii ] @xmath05007 , [ s ii ] @xmath66717,6731 , [ n ii ] @xmath06584 , which have been used for the determination of physical conditions ( e.g. , electron temperature and density ) and chemical abundances ( e.g. , oxygen , nitrogen , etc ) .",
    "we also detect in some of our galaxies the high - ionization emission line he ii @xmath04686 .",
    "although progress has been made in this field , important unsolved questions remain with regard to the mode of star formation ( e.g. , quasi - continuous vs fluctuating ) , and the triggering mechanism of ongoing starburst activity in hii / bcds .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that the cluster formation efficiency is lower in compact hii / bcd galaxies than the one found in more luminous galaxies .",
    "these luminous systems generally show an irregular outer shape and kinematical signatures of merging in their interstellar medium ( ism ) . in some cases",
    ", the formation of star cluster complexes occurs coevally @xcite , whereas in others star formation occurs in a propagating manner @xcite . in any case , the mechanism which may trigger the current star - formation in these galaxies is not well understood ; in particular the relative importance of intrinsic and environmental properties remains a subject of investigation .",
    "another important issue is the chemical and kinematical imprints of star cluster formation and evolution on the spatially resolved properties of the ism in hii / bcd galaxies . as a natural consequence of star formation driven feedback ,",
    "the newly synthesized elements will be dispersed and mixed across the ism via hydrodynamic mechanisms ( e.g. , @xcite ) , leading to _ chemical homogeneity in the oxygen abundance _",
    "@xcite of hii / bcd galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the nitrogen - to - oxygen ratio n / o has also been found to be rather constant ( log(n / o)@xmath7 - 1.6 ; @xcite ) at low metallicity ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath87.6 ) , suggesting primary production by massive stars @xcite as the main contribution to nitrogen enrichment at those very low metallicities .",
    "a small fraction of hii / bcd galaxies fall in this very - low metallicity regime @xcite and are commonly referred to as extremely metal poor ( xmp ) galaxies or xmp bcds .",
    "these galaxies are the best nearby candidates for cosmologically young objects , as various arguments imply that they have formed most of their stellar mass in the past 13 gyr @xcite . at intermediate metallicity ( 7.6@xmath112+log(o / h)@xmath18.3 ) the large observed spread in n / o has been attributed mainly to the loss of heavy elements via galactic winds @xcite , and/or to the delayed release of nitrogen by intermediate and/or massive stars and oxygen by massive stars @xcite .",
    "however , the delayed - release scenario can not explain the presence of some hii / bcd galaxies with a high n / o ratio at low metallicities .",
    "the most plausible explanation for the high n / o ratio observed in these objects is the chemical pollution of the ism by nitrogen released by massive wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars as is , apparently , the case of the well - studied bcd ngc 5253 @xcite . finally , at higher metallicities ( 12+log(o / h)@xmath98.3 ) the n / o ratio clearly increases with increasing oxygen abundance and the nitrogen content is mainly due to secondary production by intermediate - mass stars .",
    "so far , an increasing number of hii / bcd galaxies has been studied with ifu spectroscopy ( see table [ tab1 ] where we provide an overview of the literature ) with main focus on the spatial properties of the ism .",
    "recently , we have started a program investigating with ifu spectroscopy the physical conditions in the ism of the most compact hii / bcd galaxies , laying special emphasis on the extinction patterns , emission line ratios , oxygen and nitrogen abundances , kinematics and the relation on the intrinsic properties of star formation as well as possible evolutionary effects @xcite . to this end , we observed a sample of hii / bcd galaxies using the gmos - ifu on gemini south and north and , more recently , with vlt / vimos .",
    "the gmos - ifu observations were performed using the gratings b600 and r600 in one slit mode , covering a total spectral range from @xmath103000 to @xmath107230 @xmath11 .",
    "this observational setup provides a pattern of 500 hexagonal elements with a projected diameter of 0``.2 , covering a total 3''.5 @xmath125 `` field of view ( fov ) .",

    "using the reddening corrected emission line intensities of the spectra of each one of the spaxels we can derive the physical conditions ( electron temperature and density ) and the chemical abundances ( o and n ) across the ism of the galaxies .",
    "we calculate oxygen abundances in regions where the [ oiii]@xmath04363 emission line has been detected assuming o / h = o@xmath15/h@xmath15 + o@xmath16/h@xmath15 , while nitrogen abundances are obtained assuming n / h = icf(n ) @xmath12 n@xmath15/h@xmath15 , with icf(n ) denoting the ionization correction factor ( o@xmath15+o@xmath17)/o@xmath15 . for the sake of illustration , in figure [ fig4 ]",
    "we show the spatial distribution of 12+log(o / h ) in the gmos - ifu fov of the galaxy tol 2146 - 391 .",
    "we can see in this figure that , despite a slight depression in the inner part of the galaxy , the oxygen abundance appears to be uniform across the galaxy ( see figure 18 in @xcite ) .",
    "in @xcite we compare the spatial distribution of 12+log(o / h ) , found in @xcite , with the position of the star cluster / complexes detected in the galaxy um 408 by @xcite using high resolution near - ir k@xmath18-band images .",
    "we found that the variation of the observed data points ( see figure 9 in @xcite and figure 1 in @xcite ) may not be statistically significant , indicating that these regions have identical chemical properties within the errors .",
    "it is interesting to note that we observed a marginal gradient of decreasing abundance from the center outward in um 408 , indicating that the highest abundance values are found near the peak of h@xmath14 emission and extinction c(h@xmath19 ) , and coincident with the position of the brightest star cluster / complex @xcite . in any case , the absence of chemical overabundances in the ism of um 408 , tol 2146 - 391 , tol 0104 - 388 and hs2236 + 1344 and in the dwarf galaxies studied in the literature ( e.g. , @xcite ) indicates that the population of young star clusters is not producing localized oxygen overabundances .",
    "the most likely explanation for this is that metals formed in the current star - formation episode reside in a hot gas phase ( t@xmath1010@xmath20 k ; @xcite ) ; thus , they are not observable in optical wavelengths . whereas metals from previous star - formation events are well mixed and homogeneously distributed through the whole galaxy . in tol 2146 - 391 , the 12+log(n / h ) radial distribution shows a slight decrease with radius .",
    "this would argue in favor of heavy elements being produced in a previous burst of star - formation and dispersed within the ism by starburst - driven super - shells @xcite , while the depressed central region could be attributed to radial inflow of relatively low metallicity gas from large radii to the center , thus diluting the abundance of the gas in the nuclear region .",

    "more details in @xcite . ]    regarding the integrated properties of the galaxies , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite suggest that there is a dependence between n / o and the ew(h@xmath19 ) , in the sense of an increasing n / o ratio with decreasing ew(h@xmath19 ) .",
    "izotov et al .",
    "@xcite argue that this trend is naturally explained by nitrogen ejection from wr stars . in the following analysis",
    ", we mainly concentrate on the spatially resolved physical properties of the ism in individual galaxies and their possible relation to the star formation process ( e.g. , the star formation history , burst parameter , wr star content ) . in figure 5",
    "( see @xcite ) we show the log ( n / o ) versus ew(h@xmath19 ) and 12+log(o / h ) versus log ( n / o ) for all spaxels of the galaxies tol 0104 - 388 and tol 2146 - 391 . from that figure , it can be seen that the ew(h@xmath19 ) values are rather constant , with a very small variation of equivalent widths as the n / o ratio increases .",
    "a comparison of log ( n / o ) versuss 12+log(o / h ) in tol 2146 - 391 ( figure 3b ) reveals that the log ( n / o ) values increase with the 12+log(o / h ) .",
    "this data point distribution has similar patterns to those found in hii / bcd galaxies by @xcite of increasing n / o ratios with respect to the oxygen abundance .",
    "the inner region of tol 2146 - 391 ( near the peak of h@xmath14 ) presents n / o ratios which are larger than those expected by pure primary production of nitrogen .",
    "this might be a signature of time delay between the release of oxygen and nitrogen @xcite , or gas infall or outflow . in any case , for the metallicity of tol 2146 - 391 purely secondary nitrogen enrichment appears implausible . in the case of hs2236 + 1433 , we reported in @xcite evidence for a high n / o ratio in one of the three ghiirs of the galaxy",

    "more details in @xcite.,width=268 ]    in summary , the results obtained in our studies suggest that the chemical properties ( o , n and n / o ) across hii / bcd galaxies are fairly uniform , although a slight gradient of o and n are observed in the ism of um 408 and tol 2146 - 391 , respectively .",
    "we suggest that global hydro - dynamical processes , such as starburst - driven super - shells or / and inflow of gas might be governing the transport and mixing of metals across these galaxies , keeping the n / o ratio constant through the ism at large scales @xcite .",
    "the origin of high - ionization emission lines , such as [ ne v ] @xmath03426 , [ fe v ] @xmath04227 and he ii @xmath04686 in starburst and hii / bcd galaxies has been a subject of study in the last years , given that photoionization models of hii regions generally fail to reproduce the observed intensities of these lines ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "several mechanisms for producing hard ionizing radiation have been proposed in the literature , such as wr stars @xcite , primordial ( zero - metallicity ) stars , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxb ; @xcite ) , radiative shocks @xcite and o stars at low metallicity @xcite . in @xcite and",
    "@xcite we studied with gmos - ifu the spatial distribution of he ii @xmath04686 in the compact hii galaxies tol  0104 - 388 and tol  2146 - 391 , and in the xmp bcd galaxy hs  2236 + 1344 , respectively , in order to gain insights into the nature of their hard ionization radiation and its possible dependence on the properties of the ism @xcite .",
    "based on a spaxel - by - spaxel analysis , instead of the integrated properties of the galaxies ( see figure 15 in @xcite ) , our results indicate that the spatial distribution of he ii @xmath04686 relative to h@xmath19 does not depend on the ew(h@xmath19 ) , oxygen abundance or log(n / o ) . in particular , the oxygen abundance appears to be constant through the whole extent of our sample galaxies , as already is observed in other hii / bcd galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; and references therein ) .",
    "the opposite trend is found if we consider the integrated spectra of galaxies , in the sense that this emission line is stronger in galaxies at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "the lack of a relationship between the hardness of the ionizing radiation and the ew(h@xmath19 ) , or age , @xcite suggests that the presence of high - ionization lines , in particular he ii @xmath04686 , is not due to a single excitation mechanism .",
    "for instance , in @xcite , it was found for a sample of galaxies , with detected and non - detected wr features , the same dependence of i(he ii @xmath04686)/i(h@xmath19 ) on the ew(h@xmath19 ) .",
    "this indicates that wr stars are not the sole origin of he ii @xmath04686 in star - forming regions ( see also @xcite ) . in galaxies with detected wr stars ,",
    "the he ii @xmath04686 commonly appears to not be coincident with the location of the wr bumps ( e.g. , mrk 178 ) and these stellar features are not always seen when nebular he ii is observed ( e.g. , tol 2146 - 391 , hs2236 + 1344 , tol 65 ) .",
    "the spatial offset between wr stars and he ii @xmath04686 , in mrk 178 , is interpreted by @xcite as an effect of the mechanical energy injected by wr star winds , so wr stars are not ruled out as the main source of the observed he ii @xmath04686 in that galaxy .",
    "an examination of individual spaxels in our data cubes , and also in the integrated spectra of our sample galaxies ( e.g. , figure [ fig1 ] in this contribution ) , does not reveal any clear stellar wr features . in the case of the xmp bcd galaxy hs  2236 + 1344",
    ", we detected the heii @xmath04686 emission line in only one of the ghiirs of the galaxy ( the brightest one ) . in this galaxy",
    ", the he ii @xmath04686 line appears to be excited through point sources within a compact volume which , interestingly , does not coincide with the position where a high n / o abundance ratio has been observed .",
    "we discuss , in @xcite , the possibility that the heii @xmath04686 emission line , in hs2236 + 1344 , is associated with wr stars , high - mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , o stars at low metallicities , and/or a low - luminosity active galactic nucleus .",
    "however , since clear wr features have not been detected in that galaxy , wr stars are excluded as the primary excitation source of he ii @xmath04686 emission .",
    "as far as the spatial distribution of oxygen abundances is concerned , we did not detect localized overabundances in any of our sample galaxies .",
    "however , we find evidence for a marginal negative radial abundance gradient , with the highest abundances seen at the position of the brightest star cluster complexes ( peak of h@xmath14 emission ) , in the hii / bcd galaxy um  408 at least .",
    "if real , the slight trend for an increasing 12+log(n / h ) abundance , in the galaxy tol 2146 - 391 , suggests rapid self - enrichment by the freshly produced heavy elements in the present starburst on scales of hundreds of pc , or , alternatively , metal pollution by a previous star formation episode . in any case , the oxygen and nitrogen appear to be well mixed across the ism of hii / bcd galaxies , suggesting efficient transport by expanding starburst - driven supershells and/or gas infall from the halo .",
    "our spectroscopic ifu studies suggest a mixture of compact sources as the main excitation source for localized he ii @xmath04686 emission in hii / bcd galaxies , without clear wr signatures , with wr stars probably being of secondary importance . in the galaxy tol 2146 - 391 , we favor the idea of extended he ii @xmath04686 emission being primarily due to radiative shocks in the ism .",

    "<S> we review the results from our studies , and previous published work , on the spatially resolved physical properties of a sample of hii / bcd galaxies , as obtained mainly from integral - field unit spectroscopy with gemini / gmos and vlt / vimos . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm that , within observational uncertainties , our sample galaxies show nearly spatially constant chemical abundances , similar to other low - mass starburst galaxies . they also show he ii @xmath04686 emission with properties being suggestive of a mix of excitation sources , with wolf - rayet stars being excluded as the primary one . </S>",
    "<S> finally , in this contribution we include a list of all hii / bcd galaxies studied thus far with integral - field unit spectroscopy . </S>"
