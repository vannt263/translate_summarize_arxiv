    "in general , black holes are defined uniquely by their mass , angular momentum and charge ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we shall deal exclusively with schwarzschild black holes , where the angular momentum and charge are both zero .",
    "these black holes of mass @xmath5 are understood as systems defined uniquely by the condition @xmath6 and have the following properties :    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9    equation ( 1 ) defines the schwarzschild radius in terms of the mass .",
    "relation ( 2 ) establishes the entropy @xmath10 of the system as @xmath11 of the horizon area @xmath12 , in units of the planck area @xmath13 .",
    "equation ( 3 ) states that the black hole radiates as a black body of the given temperature @xmath14 .",
    "this emission process implies a loss of energy for the system , which results in an evaporation rate for the black hole given by : @xmath15 .",
    "notice that @xmath16 , fixing the internal energy of the black hole as @xmath17 .",
    "equation ( 1 ) has been about in speculative form since the 18th century , and was given a firm theoretical footing within the framework of general relativity during 1930s .",
    "equations  ( 2)-(3 ) are the result of the vigorous development in black hole thermodynamics of the 1960s and 1970s by various authors , notably bekenstein and hawking ( cf . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it has been suggested ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for a review ) that for any physical system equation ( 2 ) should hold always , with @xmath18 replacing the equality , which in turn should hold only in the black hole regime .",
    "this is termed the holographic principle , from the fact that the information content of an object would be limited not by its 3d volume , but by its 2d bounding surface .",
    "the interesting connection implied between quantum mechanics through @xmath19 and gravity through the particle horizon , has raised the hope that the validity of the holographic principle would yield important clues regarding quantum theories of gravity . in this sense ,",
    "even a heuristic study as to the possible origin of this principle should prove valuable .",
    "we study the behaviour of a classical black body photon gas as it is compressed into a black hole , and propose a simple model for such a system using only photons confined to the schwarzschild radius at their lowest possible momentum level .",
    "two parameters determine the model , with a restriction only on the product of both of them .",
    "a formal statistical mechanical calculation is given through which these parameters are determined , leading to agreement with all black hole structural properties of equations ( 1 - 3 ) .",
    "the study of a self  gravitating photon sphere ( a geon ) was first introduced by wheeler @xcite in 1955 .",
    "much development in this area has grown since then related to different physical properties of boson stars ( see e.g. @xcite ) and their stability .",
    "given recent proposals of a physical model for a black hole interior within the framework of loop quantum gravity @xcite , we analyse our model in this context . taking the view that the bekenstein entropy has an statistical mechanical origin in terms of counting states on the surface defined by the schwarzschild radius of a black hole , canonical quantum gravity has yielded scenarios in which this entropy can be derived from first principles .",
    "we find no inconsistencies with the quantum gravity approach , which in fact allows us to explicitly and independently re - evaluate the parameters introduced in the quantum simple model , obtaining the same results .",
    "most of the material in this section can be found elsewhere , e.g. @xcite , it is reproduced here for context . for a photon gas having a black body spectrum",
    "the following well known relations define the total electromagnetic energy @xmath20 and entropy @xmath21 in terms of the volume and temperature :    @xmath22    @xmath23    for a spherical region of radius @xmath24 .",
    "if we think of an ideal adiabatic wall enclosing this spherical region , we immediately obtain the well known scaling of @xmath25 , and we can eliminate @xmath26 from equation(4 ) in favour of @xmath21 and @xmath27 to obtain    @xmath28    where @xmath29 is a numerical constant of order unity .",
    "if we think of the contraction as proceeding into the black hole regime , we would think of the radius as reaching @xmath30 , which in this case would yield    @xmath31    in equation ( 7 ) we have used equation ( 1 ) , replacing @xmath5 for @xmath32 .",
    "substitution of @xmath20 from equation ( 6 ) into equation ( 7 ) leads to    @xmath33    where @xmath34 is a numerical factor of order unity .",
    "two interesting conclusions are immediately evident from this last equation .",
    "firstly , it is obvious that for any black body photon gas having @xmath35 , a schwarzschild radius larger than the plank length , the holographic principle will be valid throughout the contraction process , as the horizon area will always be larger than @xmath36 .",
    "second , that the classical equations for the diluted photon gas , equations ( 4 - 5 ) , can not be valid into the black hole regime , since the required relationship for the entropy of such an object is equation ( 2 ) and the exponent of equation ( 8) is @xmath37 and not @xmath38 .",
    "the inconsistency of equation ( 8) with equation ( 2 ) signals that physical processes which the system being modelled surely experiences , such as pair creation at high temperatures and quantum effects related to the dimensions of the system being comparable to the typical de broglie wavelengths of the photons , are not been taken into account by the classical description of the photon gas through equations ( 4 - 5 ) . so far , we have assumed that the photon gas was being compressed by some external agency , however , if it is to form a self gravitating object , an equilibrium configuration should exist , and possibly a collapse beyond this .",
    "this point can be estimated by evaluating the jeans length @xmath39 of the problem for a sound speed @xmath40 ,    @xmath41    in this context , the mass density @xmath42 is equivalent to @xmath43 . notice that equation   is derived directly from einstein s equations , where the pressure term is directly @xmath44 , hence no assumption of particle interactions is being made ( see the appendix for details on this ) . from equation",
    "we see that since @xmath45 scales with @xmath46 , @xmath39 will scale with @xmath47 , which is interesting given that under adiabatic conditions the radius of the system will scale with @xmath48 .",
    "this means that gravitational instability will occur , i.e. @xmath49 above a certain critical temperature , below a certain critical equilibrium radius @xmath50 .",
    "the situation becomes increasingly unstable in going towards smaller radii and larger temperatures .",
    "in general , for a fluid of mass  energy @xmath5 , radius @xmath24 and sound speed @xmath51 ,    @xmath52    which expressing m in terms of the schwarzschild radius through equation ( 1 ) reads ,    @xmath53    if we take the critical condition @xmath54 , the previous relation gives    @xmath55    equation(11 ) shows that , since for all non  relativistic systems @xmath56 , we should expect @xmath57 .",
    "indeed , for most astrophysical applications the jeans radius of a system is many orders of magnitude larger than the schwarzschild radius .",
    "however , in going to a relativistic fluid , the condition @xmath58 will apply , leading to @xmath59 .",
    "in other words , the self - gravitating regime will appear only close to the black hole regime .",
    "for the adiabatic photon gas we have studied , taking @xmath40 and equations ( 4 - 5 ) and ( 9 ) , in correspondence with equation ( 11 ) we obtain also @xmath59 .",
    "this last result shows that the self - gravitating regime for the photon gas we have studied does not appear until one is very close to the black hole regime , at scales where the analysis leading to equation ( 8) already showed that the structure equations for the gas ( 4 ) and ( 5 ) are no longer valid . in any case , the analysis following equation ( 9 ) together with equation ( 11 ) , strongly suggests that any self - gravitating photon gas will be very close to catastrophic collapse and black hole formation .",
    "the above results are in fact valid into the regime where the self - gravity of the radiation field is important , as shown by @xcite , instability sets in for @xmath60 , but equilibrium maximum entropy configuration exist above this radius , which however also show the scaling of equation ( 8) , c.f .",
    "their results following their equation ( 41 ) .",
    "the gravitational collapse and transition between the classical regime of section  ii and a black hole will not be treated explicitly .",
    "advances in that direction can be found e.g. in @xcite @xcite and @xcite .",
    "being subject to the extreme gravitational regime of @xmath61 , it is reasonable to expect that the photons will be highly limited in momentum space . at this point",
    "we introduce as a hypothesis that all photons will have a wavelength @xmath1 , with @xmath62 a numerical constant .",
    "we can evaluate the internal energy of the system as :    @xmath63    where @xmath0 is the total number of photons . establishing a correspondence between @xmath20 and the internal energy of a black hole as @xmath64 , and using equation ( 1 ) to express @xmath5 in terms of @xmath30 , the above expression yields :    @xmath65    if we think of a correspondence between the total entropy of the system and the total photon number given by @xmath66 , with @xmath67 a proportionality constant expected to be of order unity , we find by comparison to equation ( 2 ) that the configuration we propose will satisfy all required black hole properties if the condition @xmath68 is satisfied .",
    "we can compute @xmath69 directly by calculating the entropy of the proposed system from first principles , through the thermodynamic potential @xmath70 given by :    @xmath71 /k_{b}t } \\right),\\ ] ]    where the summation is over quantum states , @xmath72 is the chemical potential , and @xmath73 is the energy of the @xmath74 state . since the total number of components of the system is given by :    @xmath75 /k_{b}t}-1 }   } \\right),\\ ] ]    and given that in the system proposed all photons have the same energy , we can write    @xmath76 /k_{b}t } } -1}.\\ ] ]    note that each photon is assumed to be in a distinct detailed quantum level , and hence the analogy with a condensate is not complete .",
    "now ,    @xmath77 / k_{b } t = \\ln(2),\\ ] ]    which when substituted back into equation  ( 14 ) gives :    @xmath78    this last result now yields the entropy for the system through @xmath79 as @xmath80 , providing a justification for the assumption of @xmath66 made above , in terms of simple statistical physics arguments .",
    "we hence obtain @xmath81 and @xmath82 .",
    "note that the previous results are of general validity for bosons , the case of photons is obtained with @xmath83 .",
    "we also note that given the restriction of a fixed total internal energy , in the hypothesis that this is to be the sum of the energies of @xmath0 photons , the maximum entropy state will be the one with the most photons . in that case , all photons are at their lowest possible energy @xmath1 .",
    "hence , the configuration proposed is also a maximum entropy state and is suggestive of a micro  physical origin for black hole entropy .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the shortest scale that can enter into any physical theory is the planck length .",
    "although so far we have been working under the assumption of macroscopic black holes , we can extrapolate to the very small scales as follows . in the context of the ideas presented here a natural lower limit for the schwarzschild radius of order the plank length appears by setting @xmath84 in equation  ( 13 ) , a single photon black hole .",
    "the energy @xmath85 associated to this single photon is @xmath86 .",
    "note that using equation ( 1 ) to substitute @xmath87 for @xmath88 in equation   gives the following quantisation for the mass @xmath89 of a black hole in units of the planck mass :    @xmath90    where @xmath91 , a quantisation suggested already by bekenstein s entropy equation ( 2 ) . for sufficiently small black hole masses",
    ", this equation suggests a discrete spectrum associated to the transitions @xmath92 , @xmath93 , etc . the change in mass @xmath94 corresponding to a @xmath95 transition is given by    @xmath96^{1/2 }",

    "if we now identify the time scale @xmath101 for the mass loss @xmath102 to take place with the limit of the heisenberg uncertainty principle , we can set up @xmath103 . under the above considerations ,",
    "the mass evaporation rate for a black hole is    @xmath104    which is within a numerical constant of the standard evaporation rate for a black hole @xcite , seen here as the macroscopic limit of an intrinsically quantum process .",
    "if the structure of the photon configuration we are describing is in any way related to quantum phenomena akin to bose - einstein condensation , we should expect the temperature to lie well below the critical temperature @xmath105 for bose - einstein condensation .",

    "any realistic black hole will be at a temperature much lower than the critical temperature for bose - einstein condensation for photons , showing the internal consistency of the model .",
    "the physics described so far is clearly highly idealised , however in a core collapse process within a massive star , as for the central region @xmath126 , the typical speeds and @xmath51 of the constituent particles must necessarily tend to @xmath127 , with de broglie wavelengths not larger than the schwarzschild radius .    at this point , quantum effects similar to bose - einstein condensation could take place , packing all ( or most ) photons into the lowest energy state . in this sense ,",
    "typical wavelengths of the order of the schwarzschild radius would be expected , as longer wavelengths would be prohibited by the containment imposed by gravity , and shorter wavelengths would imply an expansion in momentum space . in this sense , the identification we have maintained of the constituent particles as photons is shown to be largely arbitrary , any relativistic bosons will yield essentially identical conclusions .",
    "we now explore the ideas of the previous sections within the framework of loop gravity . in particular",
    ", we will see that this allows us an independent re - evaluation the constants @xmath62 and @xmath67 established in the last section , with the aid of some general results from loop quantum gravity .",
    "the loop quantisation of @xmath128 general relativity is described in terms of a set of spin network states which span the hilbert space on which the theory is based .",
    "these spin network states are labelled by closed abstract graphs with spins assigned to each link and intertwining operators assigned to each vertex .    a resent result that follows from the theory",
    "is that if a surface @xmath129 is intersected by a link @xmath130 of a spin network carrying the label @xmath131 it acquires an area @xcite",
    "@xmath132    where @xmath133 is the immirzi parameter .",
    "let us now consider for our purposes that the horizon @xmath129 is intersected by a large number @xmath134 of links .",
    "each intersection with @xmath129 represents a puncture . in the limit of large @xmath134",
    ", one can say that each puncture is equipped with an internal space @xmath135 ( the space of all flat @xmath136 connections on the punctured sphere ) of dimension @xcite    @xmath137    each puncture of an edge with spin @xmath138 increases the dimension of the boundary hilbert space by a factor of @xmath139 . under these considerations",
    ", it follows that the entropy can be calculated by    @xmath140    statistically , the most important contribution comes from those configurations in which the lowest possible spin @xmath141 dominates , so we can write the entropy ( [ entropy ] ) as    @xmath142    where @xmath143 is given by    @xmath144    due to the fact that the assumed gauge group of loop quantum gravity is su@xmath145 , then it follows that @xmath146 , and so the immirzi parameter is given by @xcite    @xmath147    and ( [ npunc1 ] ) becomes    @xmath148    the number of links @xmath149 associated to the particles we are dealing with in this article must be proportional to the number of particles @xmath150 . the simplest possible configuration is the one in which the proportionality factor is equal to unity and so ,    @xmath151    using this relation and equations   and ( [ npunc2 ] ) we can evaluate @xmath62 to obtain    @xmath152    the parameter @xmath67 previously defined through the relation @xmath153 can now be re - derived independently through equation ( [ entropy2 ] ) to yield :    @xmath154    from ( [ alfa ] ) and ( [ beta ] ) we can see that the product @xmath155 as required by the considerations on section iii .",
    "it is interesting that the model proposed in the previous sections is seen not to be in conflict with a loop gravity approach , which indeed allows to re  evaluate the scaling parameters introduced earlier independently and in accordance with the expectations of the physics discussed above .",
    "a photon gas contained within an adiabatic enclosure will satisfy the holographic principle , at least until before reaching the black hole regime , which approximately coincides with the self - gravitating condition and where the classical description is no longer valid .",
    "a configuration where all photons have the same energy within @xmath156 can be constructed to satisfy all black hole conditions .",
    "this configuration gives rise to a discrete evaporation spectrum for @xmath157 close to the planck length , and in the macroscopic limit allows a re - derivation of the standard black hole evaporation rate .",
    "our results are consistent with the loop quantum gravity scheme , satisfying the constraints required to be in agreement with the bekenstein - hawking entropy for a black hole .",
    "a comparison of both regimes studied is highly suggestive of a heuristic proof of the holographic principle , as any real system would require an increase of entropy ( at fixed energy and volume ) to be turned into the photon gas we have studied .",

    "in order to show that the jeans gravitational instability limit is valid in the general relativistic regime , let us proceed as follows .",
    "the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium in general relativistic fluid mechanics is obtained by using the fact that the field is static .",
    "this means that one can describe the problem in a frame of reference in which the fluid is at rest , with all hydrodynamical quantities independent of time .",
    "this also implies that the mixed space and time components of the metric tensor are null . under these assumptions , the equation of hydrostatic equilibrium",
    "is then given by @xcite      where @xmath159 is the time component of the metric tensor , @xmath160 is the enthalpy per unit volume , @xmath85 internal energy density and @xmath161 the pressure .",
    "oppenheimer & volkoff @xcite showed that equation   can be brought to the form ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* )          and @xmath166 is the mass  energy density of the fluid .",
    "note that for the case of relativistic and non  relativistic dust particles , @xmath163 represents the mass of particles within radius @xmath164 . for the case of a photon gas , @xmath163 is the mass corresponding to the internal energy .        with constant index @xmath168 .",
    "this means that the sound velocity @xmath169 is given by the relation @xmath170 and so , the left hand side of equation   can be written as @xmath171 . seen in this way , the left hand side of equation   no longer represents gradients of pressure which are in balance with self  gravitational forces related to the plasma .",
    "indeed , the balance with the gravitational forces produced by the plasma is now related to the gradients of its proper internal energy density @xmath85 by      let us now take the absolute value on both sides of equation  . to order of magnitude @xmath173 and @xmath174 .",
    "a gravitational instability occurs when the absolute value of the left hand side of equation   ( or equivalently equation  ) is less than the absolute value of its right hand side . using all the above statements it follows that this instability occurs when the radial coordinate @xmath164 is such that      the quantity @xmath176 on the right hand side of equation   is of the same order of magnitude as the standard jeans length used in non",
    " relativistic fluid dynamics . in other words",
