    "pairs of closely stacked quantum dots ( qds ) coupled via inter - band dipole moments @xcite ( double quantum dots , dqds ) or by tunneling resulting from carrier wave function overlap and coulomb correlations @xcite ( quantum dot molecules , qdms ) attract much attention due to the richness of their physical properties which show huge technological promise for nanoelectronics , spintronics and quantum information processing applications .",
    "the unique features of these systems , as compared to individual qds , can be used as the basis for long - time storage of quantum information @xcite and conditional optical control of carrier states @xcite which pave the way to an implementation of a two - qubit quantum gate @xcite .",
    "double dot structures enable also coherent optical spin control and entangling @xcite or may act as sources of entangled photons @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that the exciton spectrum of a qdm can be used to define an excitonic qubit with an extended life time @xcite , that information can be written on the spin state of the dopant mn ion located in one of the dots forming a dqd @xcite , and that a photon emitted by a nearby quantum point contact may induce carrier transfer in a dqd system @xcite .",
    "the richness and complexity of the physical properties of these systems have been manifested in many optical experiments @xcite .",
    "the spacing between the dots forming intentionally manufactured dqds and qdms is typically on the order of nanometers which is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the wavelength of a resonantly coupled photon . under such conditions , in atomic samples the effect of superradiant emission",
    "is observed @xcite .",
    "a similar effect of coupling to common radiative modes appears also in the emission from qd systems . here also",
    "superradiance - like phenomena occur in the evolution of the exciton occupation and polarization .",
    "apart from the modified evolution for spontaneous emission , collective coupling to the radiation field can lead to other physical effects , one of which is the vacuum induced coherence ( vic ) @xcite .",
    "this effect consists in spontaneous , partial coherent excitation transfer from an initially occupied qd to initially empty one which results in exciton occupation trapping in a decoherence - resistant state . like the superradiance phenomena",
    ", the vic effect can be expected to occur also in qd systems .    on the other hand , although natural atoms and qds have many properties in common , the characteristic feature of the latter is the inhomogeneity of transition energy which , for technologically realistic structures , is on the order of milli - electron - volts .",
    "moreover , small spatial separation of the dots leads to coupling between them @xcite . in our previous works we studied the impact of the transition energy mismatch and the coupling between the two emitters on the stability of collective effects @xcite and their role in the linear @xcite and nonlinear optical response of the dqd systems @xcite .",
    "we showed that , in the absence of coupling the between the qds , the appearance of an optically inactive subradiant state and a rapidly decaying superradiant one are extremely sensitive to the fundamental transition energy mismatch and already for a mismatch on the order of micro - electron - volts the collective character of the evolution is replaced by oscillation around the average exponential decay .",
    "the destructive effect of the system inhomogeneity may be , to some extent , overcome by sufficiently strong coupling between the dots which rebuilds collective behavior even in structures with technologically realistic values of energy mismatch @xcite .",
    "we have also pointed out that phonon - induced dynamics can slow down the decay of a superradiant state or speed up the emission from the superradiant one @xcite . based on these previous investigations of superradiance phenomena in qds",
    ", one can expect that the vic effect should , in principle , also be observable in these systems , at least in the presence of sufficiently strong coupling @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge , its stability against various inhomogeneities and perturbations typical for the solid state environmnet ( in particular non - parallel orientation of the interband dipoles in the two dots as well as phonon perturbations ) have not been studied .    in this paper",
    ", we study the necessary conditions for the vic effect to appear in a system of two vertically stacked semiconductor qds .",
    "we investigate the role of the fundamental transition energy mismatch , coupling between the dots , and phonon - induced kinetics in this process .",
    "we also pay particular attention to the difference of the magnitude of the interband dipole moments as well as to their non - parallel alignment ( due to subband mixing ) .",
    "we show that in spite of all these inhomogeneities that are typical to qd structures ( as opposed to natural atoms ) the vacuum - induced coherence can be almost fully stabilized in realistic pairs of non - identical qds in a certain range of parameters .",
    "in particular , different interband dipole moments for the two dots lead to the appearance of a state which is perfectly immune to radiative decay for a particular choice of the system parameters .",

    "already for the fundamental transition energy mismatch on the order of the emission line width , the exciton occupation is quenched .",
    "however , the destructive effect of the energy inhomogeneity can be strongly reduced by coupling between the dots . while for dots with identical magnitudes of the interband dipole moments full stabilization of the spontaneously formed coherence",
    "can only be achieved in the limit of infinite coupling , in pairs of qds with different interband dipoles it is possible to adjust the energy mismatch , the coupling between the qds , and the dipole moments in such a way that a perfectly stable state forms in the spontaneous emission process and a fraction of the initial excitonic population attains a formally infinite life time .",
    "the non - parallel orientation of the interband dipoles , that may be caused by heavy - light hole mixing leads to negligibly weak effects in realistic structures .",
    "while carrier - phonon coupling typically destroys the vacuum induced coherence on picosecond time scales , it can be overcome by appropriately selecting the energy splitting between the single exciton states .",
    "these results show that the vic effect can be observed in realistic systems with energy splitting on the order of milli - electron - volts provided that the system parameters ( interband dipoles , coupling and energy mismatch ) can be controlled with sufficient flexibility .",
    "this seems to be possible by appropriately designing the system on the manufacturing stage and then employing the dependence of various parameters on external fields ( e.g , via stark effect or modification of electron - hole wave function overlap ) .",
    "let us note , finally , that the major experimentally detectable consequence of the appearance of vacuum - induced coherence in the double dot system is the long - living tail in the exciton occupation ( or in luminescence intensity ) .",
    "since this effect is of considerable amplitude and evolves on long , nanosecond time scales it should be relatively easily detectable with time - resolved luminescence or pump probe spectroscopy .",

    "in this appendix , we discuss the effect of light hole admixture on the non - parallel alignment of the interband dipoles for ( nominally ) heavy hole transitions .    within the 4-band luttinger model @xcite , the electron and hole wave functions are @xmath132 where @xmath133 refers to a higher or lower qd",
    ", respectively , @xmath134 is a bloch function for the valence subband @xmath22 ( heavy holes : @xmath135 , light holes : @xmath136 ) , @xmath137 is the space coordinate , @xmath138 denotes spin , @xmath139 is an electron bloch function with a fixed spin @xmath140 ( for definiteness ) and @xmath141 refer to electron and hole envelope functions , respectively .    the matrix element of the interband dipole moment for the @xmath16th qd is @xmath142 to calculate the above integral we sum over unit cells ( labeled by @xmath143 ) and integrate over one unit cell ( @xmath144 labels the position within the cell ) .",
    "the envelope functions vary slowly which allows us to assume that they are constant over one unit cell , @xmath145 .",
    "the bloch functions are periodic , @xmath146 , and orthogonal for different bands . as a result , we can write @xcite @xmath147 here @xmath148 is the bulk interband dipole moment , @xmath149 @xmath26 is the unit cell volume , @xmath150 is the envelop function overlap integral , and we have replaced the summation over unit cells with integration over @xmath143 .",
    "we are investigating bright heavy hole excitons , hence @xmath151 and the other coefficients @xmath152 are much smaller .",
    "the non - vanishing bulk dipole moment matrix elements involving the spin-@xmath153 electron state are @xcite @xmath154    because the wave functions differ for the two qds , the values of the heavy hole overlap integrals @xmath155 may vary . since , to the leading order , @xmath156 the difference of the overlap integrals leads to different magnitudes of the dipole moments @xmath157 , @xmath158 .",
    "moreover , one has @xmath159 hence , @xmath160 thus , if the light hole admixture is different for the two dots , @xmath161 then @xmath162 , that is , the dipoles are non - parallel .",
    "as the subband mixing is typically small in self - assembled structures the angle @xmath83 between the dipole moments is small .",
    "therefore , one can write @xmath163 where @xmath164 is an irrelevant phase . comparing eqs .",
