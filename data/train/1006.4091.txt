    "entanglement plays a crucial role in quantum information and computation as a measure of nonclassical correlations between parts of a quantum system @xcite .",
    "the strength of those quantum correlations is significant in highly entangled states , which are involved and exploited in powerful communication and computational tasks that are not possible classically .",
    "random pure states are of special interest as their average entropy is close to its possible maximum value @xcite . taking a quantum state at random also corresponds to assuming minimal prior knowledge about the system @xcite .",
    "random states can thus be seen as `` typical states '' to which an arbitrary time - evolving quantum state may be compared .",
    "in addition , random states are useful in the context of quantum chaotic or nonintegrable systems @xcite .",
    "there exist several measures for quantifying entanglement @xcite . for a bipartite quantum system ,",
    "the entropy ( either the von neumann or the renyi entropies ) is a well - known measure of entanglement . for a multipartite system ,",
    "the full distribution of bipartite entanglement between two parts of the system has been proposed as a measure of multipartite entanglement @xcite .",
    "the distribution of entropy in a bipartite system is thus generally useful for characterizing entanglement properties of a random pure state .",
    "statistical properties of observables such as the von neumann entropy , concurrence , purity or the minimum eigenvalue for random pure states have been studied extensively  @xcite . in particular , the average von neumann entropy is known to be close to its maximal value ( for a large system ) . in contrast , few studies have addressed the full distribution of the entropy : only the distribution of the purity for very small systems @xcite and partial information on the laplace transform of the purity distribution for large systems @xcite have previously appeared in the literature .",
    "our purpose here is to compute the full distribution of the renyi entropies for a random pure state in a large bipartite quantum system . in particular , we show that the common idea that a random pure state is maximally entangled is not quite correct : while the average entropy is indeed close to its maximal value @xcite , the probability of an almost maximally entangled state is in fact vanishingly small .",
    "this statement requires to compute the full probability distribution of the entropy , namely its large deviation tails , which is one of the goals achieved in our paper .    the calculation of the renyi entropies distribution proceeds by mapping the entanglement problem to an equivalent random matrix model , which describes the statistical properties of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem .",
    "we can then use coulomb gas methods borrowed from random matrix theory .",
    "we identify three regimes in the distribution of the entropy , as a direct consequence of two phase transitions in the associated coulomb gas problem .",
    "one of those transitions is akin to a bose - einstein condensation , with one charge of the coulomb gas detaching from the sea of the other charges - or equivalently one eigenvalue of the reduced density matrix becoming much larger than the others .",
    "this paper is a detailed version of a short letter that was published recently  @xcite .",
    "it thus contains all explicit formulas for our results and details about analytical proofs and numerical simulations as well as new results , especially for the third regime of the distribution ( see below ) , the von neumann entropy and the maximal eigenvalue of the density matrix . +",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : randbip ] , we describe precisely our model of bipartite quantum system for the direct product @xmath0 of two hilbert spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 . in section",
    "[ sec : distriev ] , we analyze the distribution of the eigenvalues @xmath3 of the reduced density matrices of the two subsystems .",
    "in particular , we compute the average density of eigenvalues and explain the coulomb gas method that we also use later for computing the distribution of the renyi entropy @xmath4 where @xmath5 . in section [ sec : pdfsigmaq ] , we compute the full distribution of @xmath6 for a large system .",
    "we find two phase transitions in the associated coulomb gas , and thus three regimes for the distribution of @xmath6 .",
    "in section [ sec : renyi ] , using results from section [ sec : pdfsigmaq ] , we derive the distribution of the renyi entropy @xmath7 as well as the distribution of the von neumann entropy ( case @xmath8 ) and the distribution of the largest eigenvalue ( @xmath9 ) . finally in section [ sec : montecarlo ] , we present results obtained by monte carlo numerical simulations that we performed to test and verify our analytical predictions .",
    "in this section , we set the problem of bipartite entanglement for a random pure state .",
    "we first describe a bipartite quantum system , introduce then measures of entanglement ( the von neumann and renyi entropies ) and give finally the precise definition of random pure states .",
    "let us consider a bipartite quantum system @xmath10 composed of two subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 of respective dimensions @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the system is described by the product hilbert space @xmath15 with @xmath16 and @xmath17 . here",
    ", we shall be interested in the limit where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are large and @xmath18 is fixed .",
    "we shall take @xmath19 , i.e. @xmath20 , so that @xmath11 and @xmath12 play the role of the subsystem of interest and of the environment , respectively .",
    "let @xmath21 be a pure state of the full system .",
    "its density matrix @xmath22 is a positive semi - definite hermitian matrix normalized as @xmath23 .",
    "the density matrix can thus be diagonalized , its eigenvalues are non - negative and their sum is unity .",
    "subsystem @xmath11 is described by its reduced density matrix @xmath24}= \\sum_{\\alpha^b=1}^m \\langle \\alpha^b |\\rho| \\alpha^b \\rangle$ ] , where @xmath25 is an orthonormal basis of @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , @xmath12 is described by @xmath26}$ ] .",
    "it is easy to show that the reduced matrices @xmath27 and @xmath28 share the same set of non - negative eigenvalues @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "any pure state can be written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 is a fixed orthonormal basis of @xmath33 .",
    "the singular value decomposition of the matrix @xmath34 permits to recast the previous expression in the so - called schmidt decomposition form : @xmath35 and @xmath36 represent the eigenvectors of @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively , associated with the same eigenvalue @xmath3 .",
    "the representation ( [ eq : schmidt ] ) , namely the schmidt number @xmath37 of strictly positive eigenvalues , is very useful for characterizing the entanglement between subsystems @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "for example , let us consider two limiting cases :    \\(i ) if only one of the eigenvalues , say @xmath3 , is non zero then @xmath38 , @xmath39 and the state of the full system @xmath40 is a product state , which is said to be separable .",

    "as one varies the parameter @xmath47 , the renyi entropy interpolates between the von neumann entropy ( @xmath50 ) and @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) where @xmath53 is the largest eigenvalue of the reduced density matrices . +      a pure state is called random when it is sampled according to the uniform haar measure , which is unitarily invariant .",
    "specifically , a random pure state is defined as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is a fixed orthonormal basis of @xmath33 and where the variables @xmath54 are uniformly distributed among the sets of @xmath54 satisfying the constraint @xmath55 ( normalization of @xmath21 ) .",
    "equivalently , the probability density function ( pdf ) of the @xmath56 matrix @xmath57 with entries @xmath34 can be written @xmath58 with the second equality showing that the pdf can also be seen as a gaussian supplemented by the unit - trace constraint .    in the basis @xmath59 of @xmath60 , the reduced density matrix of subsystem @xmath61",
    "is simply given by @xmath62 .",

    "the constraint is to be included in the distribution of the eigenvalues of @xmath27 , which is given @xcite by : @xmath71 with @xmath65 ( the @xmath34 are complex ) and the normalization constant @xmath72 computed using selberg s integrals @xcite : @xmath73 the presence of a fixed trace constraint ( as in eq . ( [ jpdfev ] ) )",
    "is known to have important consequences on the spectral properties of a matrix  @xcite .",
    "we will see that in the present context also , the fixed trace constraint does play an important and crucial role .",
    "in particular , this constraint is directly responsible for a bose - einstein type condensation transition that will be discussed in the context of the probability distribution of the entanglement entropy .",
