    "low - mass star formation is known to occur exclusively in the shielded interiors of molecular cloud cores , when gravity wrests control from supporting thermal , magnetic and turbulent pressures and collapse ensues . over the past 20 years",
    ", much effort has been focused on understanding the subsequent stages of star formation , when a central object and a surrounding circumstellar disk are formed and evolve toward a newly formed star and , potentially , its associated planetary system . however , the initiation of this process is among the least understood steps of star formation .",
    "yet , it is key to understanding some of its most fundamental aspects , such as the initial mass function , the binarity fraction and its dependence on stellar mass , and the star formation efficiency .    generally , starless cores are thought to represent this earliest stage of star formation . in one view , magnetically supported clouds develop magnetically critical cores over a long timescale ( a few myr ) in quasi - static fashion through the process of ambipolar diffusion @xcite .",
    "alternatively , turbulence continuously shreds and twists molecular clouds , forming denser structures  through shocks  that collapse , fragment or otherwise disappear . in this view , starless cores are highly dynamical structures that evolve in a few sound - crossing times , i.e. 10 times faster than the ambipolar diffusion time scale ( see @xcite and references therein )",
    ". these different scenarios for the formation and evolution of starless cores result in very different 3-d morphological structures and unique dynamic signatures .",
    "the environment in which a core forms is also critical to its subsequent evolution .",
    "dense cores in regions of cluster - forming clouds tend to have higher masses and column densities than isolated prestellar cores .",
    "the molecular cloud cores in taurus and ophiuchus provide a case in point ( e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "much of our insight into the structure of starless cloud cores comes from observations of the millimeter dust emission @xcite .",
    "_ herschel _ observations using pacs and spire have shown that cores form preferentially along dense filaments @xcite .",
    "the _ herschel",
    "_ gould belt survey in particular has discovered a large population of nearby prestellar cores , allowing accurate determination of the core mass function ( e.g. , @xcite , but see the recent results of @xcite ) , which can be compared with model predictions for the imf produced by the collapse of a turbulent cloud ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "high angular resolution interferometric continuum studies give insights into the formation of multiple systems @xcite .",
    "however , continuum observations are likely to yield only a partial picture of the cloud structure since coagulation of dust is a key process at the high densities of inner starless cores and this will change the grain opacity coefficient and effectively `` hide '' much of the mass of the dust from view @xcite .",
    "moreover , dust studies do not provide direct insight into the dynamics of these cores nor into their chemistry .    likewise , molecular observations are also known , in general , to provide a biased view of starless cores .",
    "this reflects the condensation of species onto ice mantles at high densities .",
    "there are two exceptions to this general rule .",
    "first , for reasons that are not fully understood , nitrogen - bearing species , in particular ammonia , do not seem to participate in this freeze - out @xcite .",
    "deuterated species form the second exception ( see the recent review by @xcite ) .",
    "high deuteration of gas - phase species is , in effect , a result of the freeze - out , and coincidental disappearance of ortho-  from the gas phase , without which no deuteration would happen @xcite .",
    "this drives up the gas - phase abundance and fractionation of h@xmath1 .",
    "the high fractionation of this species is then passed on to the few molecules remaining in the gas phase , through ion - molecule chemistry @xcite .",
    "these chemical aspects can be used to our advantage to study prestellar cores .",
    "we note that some deuterated species , such as formaldehyde or water , are formed and deuterated primarily through grain - surface chemistry in icy mantles @xcite .",
    "these molecules can then be thermally or photo - desorbed in active environments , such as molecular hot cores , outflows , or shocks . of the two key deuterated species studied here ,",
    "is believed to be formed in cold , dense , co - depleted regions through gas - phase chemistry , driven by h@xmath1 and its deuterated isotopologues .",
    "ammonia deuteration is also straightforward to understand in the framework of gas - phase processes @xcite .",
    "however , recent laboratory experiments @xcite suggest that ammonia and its deuterated isotopologues may also be formed thorough successive additions of hydrogen and deuterium atoms to nitrogen atoms in co - rich interstellar ice analogues , which are efficient at temperatures below 15  k.    high spectral resolution investigations of the velocity field in central regions of cold , dense cores are invaluable for disentangling rotation and collapse @xcite , providing excellent constraints on fragmentation and formation of disks , which are critically dependent on the magnetic field @xcite",
    ". this requires , however , that suitable molecular tracers be chosen .",
    "the fundamental , submillimeter lines of ammonia isotopologues have critical densities of order @xmath2  and , with simple hyperfine patterns , are excellent tracers of dense gas at the onset of star formation @xcite , providing information complementary to h@xmath3d@xmath4 @xcite . the interferometric study of @xcite has shown a very high nh@xmath3d / nh@xmath5 fractionation ratio in the central region of l1544 , @xmath6 , which demonstrates the persistence of deuterated ammonia molecules at very high densities ( @xmath7 ) and low temperatures ( 10  k ) .",
    "very high deuteration ratios have also been reported in other molecules ( e.g. /@xmath8 in l183 ; @xcite ; see the recent review of @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , lines of deuterated isotopologues of ammonia , with their simple hyperfine patterns , fulfill all requirements for being optimum tracers of cold , dense cores .",
    "_ herschel _ has enabled for the first time systematic studies of the fundamental submillimeter lines of nh@xmath5 and nh@xmath3d in prestellar cores .",
    "the long - term goals of this study are threefold : ( a ) to firmly establish the utility of ammonia isotopologues as tracers of dense , cold gas at the onset of star formation , as postulated by @xcite ; ( b ) to determine the morphology and velocity structure of an example prestellar core , the processes that drive the evolution in this earliest stage of star formation and that control such important aspects as core fragmentation , the resulting initial mass function and binarity fraction of protostars ; ( c ) to improve our understanding of the chemical and physical processes that control gas - grain interaction , freeze out , and mantle ejection in dense cloud cores , including when / why species freeze out , and of deuterium fractionation .",
    "these processes are of key interest for the chemistry of regions of star formation and , hence , the supply of volatiles in planet - forming environments including likely the early solar nebula .    in this paper",
    ", we present extensive single - dish and interferometric observations of l1689n , a nearby ( 120  pc ; @xcite ) dark cloud located in the @xmath9  ophiuchi complex , which harbors one of the best - studied solar type protostars iras  16293 - 2422 ( hereafter iras  16293 ) .",
    "the nearby protostellar core , sometimes referred to as i16293e , has been previously suggested to be interacting with the blue lobe of one of the outflows driven by iras  16293 @xcite .",
    "this region is thus an excellent laboratory to study the effects of stellar feedback on the physics and chemistry of the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "in addition to _ herschel _ observations , we have obtained interferometric observations of the 970  dust continuum , , and n@xmath3d@xmath4 line emission using the alma compact array , as well as maps of several deuterated molecular tracers , using the caltech submillimeter observatory .",

    "however , these authors point out that a cold , high - density region with @xmath32  k can easily be hidden at the center of the core .",

    "this shows that the line broadening is mainly non - thermal and that sonic or somewhat sub - sonic turbulent motions are dominant even in the northern , quiescent part of the core .",
    "this is different from the typical prestellar cores in taurus , where line widths are essentially thermal and is perhaps related to the interaction with the outflow .",

    "the parent molecular cloud has a mean density of @xmath47  and a kinetic temperature of 12  k , based on ammonia observations @xcite .",
    "multiple large - scale molecular outflows are present , driven by iras  16293 @xcite .",
    "the sma observations of @xcite imply a primarily east - west outflow , with blueshifted emission to the west .",
    "these authors suggest that this small - scale outflow may be the inner part of the large - scale east - west outflow .",
    "more recent sma data @xcite suggest that the co emission at moderately high velocities arises from two bipolar outflows , which appear perpendicular to each other and both originate from iras  16293a .",
    "the more compact outflow is impacting the circumstellar gas around component b , and is possibly being redirected .",
    "the directions of the two compact outflows , as indicated by the sma observations of @xcite , are marked in figure  [ fig : morphology ] .",
    "the outflow originates in the two sources at the center of iras  16293a , a - e and a - w .",
    "in fact , vla observations reveal that the continuum source a - e orbits a - w , which had a recent continuum ejection event @xcite .",
    "that event defined the flow originating in a - w , with the redshifted emission to the south - west .",
    "vlbi water maser observations agree with this picture , showing a very well - defined bow - shock among the redshifted masers to the south - west ( a. wootten , private comm . )",
    "source a - e , in orbit around a - w , also shows maser outflow , approximately parallel to that in a - w and in the same sense , i.e. redshifted emission to the south - west . on larger scales",
    "the overall complexity of the l1689n region makes the interpretation of the outflow difficult .",
    "however , one clear conclusion is that there is a lot of moderate - velocity blueshifted gas in the immediate vicinity of the prestellar core and the change in the observed  line velocity and width is a direct evidence that this gas is interacting with the prestellar core .",
    "interestingly , the polarity of both compact co outflows seen in the sma data @xcite seems opposite to that of the large - scale outflows seen in the earlier lower - resolution single - dish data @xcite ( compare , e.g. , figure 1 of @xcite and figure 17 of @xcite ) .",
    "the northern peak of the blueshifted water emission appears to be a part of the main east - west outflow detected in the sma co data .",
    "vlba observations of the water maser proper motions @xcite also show that the iras  16293a outflow proceeds red ne , blue sw , from within a few au of the sources .",
    "the key observational aspects of the new data presented here that have to be satisfactorily explained by a source model are : ( a ) the change in the  line center velocity and width across the core ( figure  [ fig : nh2dvelo ] ) ; ( b ) the apparent offset between the peak of the 970  dust continuum emission and the emission of deuterated molecular tracers in the aca data ( figure  [ fig : alma1 ] ) .",
    "one possible explanation is that the prestellar core in l1689n is simply a pre - existing density enhancement , that had formed independently of iras  16293 .",
    "this region is characterized by some of the highest deuteration levels known in galactic sources .",
    "for example , it is one of a handful of sources where triply deuterated ammonia has been detected @xcite .",
    "such cores are generally rare , but barnard  1 offers another example of a similar region . here",
    ", a dense prestellar core , b1b ( also referred to as smm1 ) , with very high deuteration levels , which has been suggested to host the first hydrostatic core @xcite , is also located in close proximity to more evolved protostellar sources , b1a ( smm6 ) and b1c ( smm2 ) , driving pronounced outflows @xcite .",
    "high deuteration levels require a low temperature , high density and consequently high co depletion .",
    "such conditions are found in isolated prestellar cores , e.g. l1544 , which are characterized by a centrally peaked density distribution that can be traced well by dust continuum emission .",
    "however , our aca data reveal no bright compact dust continuum sources in the northern part of the core , where the strongest emission of deuterated molecular tracers is seen in single - dish maps .",
    "@xcite suggested that this region may be a part of the ambient cloud that is pushed and compressed by the outflow .",
    "the shock - compressed , dense gas then cools efficiently to low temperatures , and the gas - phase chemistry quickly drives up abundances of deuterated molecular species .",
    "this scenario is in fact consistent with the observations presented here .",
    "the blue lobe of the iras  16293 east - west outflow impacts the prestellar core from the back .",
    "the shock could have already propagated through the north - eastern part of the core , where we now see narrow , undisturbed line profiles in the cold , compressed post - shock gas , blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the ambient cloud .",
    "an order of magnitude density enhancement , as compared to the ambient cloud , expected in the post - shock gas , produces conditions propitious for the high deuteration levels observed .",
    "the west / south - west part of the core is , however , still interacting with the outflow , hence the disturbed appearance of the molecular line profiles , with broader line widths .",
    "the shock to the north / north - west of the core ( traced by , e.g. , the sio or ch@xmath5oh emission ) may be associated with a higher - velocity component of the flow , possibly a jet or jet remnant , as the highest blueshifted water and co emission occurs there .",
    "there may also be a pre - existing density enhancement at this location , which happens to lie in the path of the higher - velocity component of the flow , which was further compressed and heated up by the shock .",
    "this would explain the strong emission of high - density molecular tracers , such as , hcn , hnc , and sio in the single dish images ( figure  [ fig : csomaps ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "this region also stands out in the aca ch@xmath5oh image and thus shows the classic outflow - dense gas interaction signatures .",
    "the apparent offset between the dust continuum peak , as observed with the aca , and the emission of deuterated molecular tracers is another intriguing aspect .",
    "such offsets have been observed in other prestellar cores ( e.g. , l183 ; @xcite ) , or in outflows ( e.g. , l1157 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the dust continuum emission is typically taken as a measure of the  column density , indicating the location of the densest central parts of prestellar cores .",
    "however , possible variations in the dust temperature may strongly affect this interpretation .",
    "in fact , multi - wavelength _",
    "spitzer _ and _ herschel _ continuum data @xcite indicate a nw - se temperature gradient across the prestellar core , with colder dust located in the north . while the average dust temperature in a single - dish beam is 16  k @xcite , this may be dominated by the outer surface layers and the dust temperature in the central",
    ", most shielded regions may be significantly lower ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the aca 850/970  flux ratio map shows no evidence for a temperature gradient across the compact source .",
    "however , the snr in our 850  continuum image is too low to draw definitive conclusions .",
    "another important aspect is that some of the extended continuum emission may simply be filtered out in the aca data .",
    "figure  [ fig : sandell ] shows 450  scuba and scuba-2 dust continuum emission images toward the prestellar core ( @xcite , left and right panels , respectively ) , with overlaid contours of the 970  continuum and  emission observed with the aca ( green and black contours , respectively ) .",
    "the single - dish dust continuum emission in the scuba image correlates well with the  emission and is clearly shifted to the north with respect to the 970  aca continuum peak .",
    "the lower angular resolution 870  scuba image shows a similar offset .",
    "however , the 450  scuba-2 image peaks closer to the aca continuum peak .",
    "the small differences between the two images may be caused by limited snr or pointing offsets .",
    "the integrated 345  ghz aca flux is only 0.72  jy , as compared to the peak 870  broadband flux of 1.4  jy in the 14  jcmt beam @xcite .",
    "the minimum baseline of the aca is 8.7  m , for a transiting source .",
    "the effective baseline depends on the hour angle , but for a transiting source , the alma technical handbook provides a value of 13.8  for the largest angular scale recovered by the interferometer .",
    "this strongly suggests that the aca continuum image may not represent the true  column density distribution in the prestellar core .",
    "it appears instead that the northern , quiescent part of the core is characterized by spatially extended continuum emission , which is mostly resolved out by the interferometer , while the southern part is more compact and centrally peaked .",
    "this is consistent with the interpretation outlined above , in which the northern part of the core is compressed , high - density , cold post - shock gas , which is relatively uniformly distributed and not yet fragmenting to form new stars .",
    "this shows that good care should be taken when interpreting alma observations of extended sources , even with the aca , when the total power data are not included .",
    "interestingly , the  emission shows a very distinct morphology compared to any of the tracers studied here , peaking largely to the east / north - east ( see figure  1 of @xcite and the dashed magenta contour in figure  [ fig : sandell ] ) .",
    "@xcite argue that this is in fact the location of the coldest , highest column density gas in the region .",
    "we note that a weak 970  continuum peak , with a flux density of 6.9  mjy / beam ( a 6@xmath48 detection ) is present within the  emission region , which can be identified with source 86 ( sma  22 ) of @xcite .",
    "an extension in this direction is also seen in the 870  scuba image .",
    "more sensitive observations with the main alma array are required to determine the exact nature of this source .",
    "another important factor is that broadband , single - dish continuum images may be contaminated by molecular line emission .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : csomaps ] , only the classical tracers of dense cold gas , namely deuterated species and , peak toward the prestellar core .",
    "other molecular tracers largely avoid the core and peak instead toward the e1 shock .",
    "however , a weak  43 emission peak associated with the northern part of the core was detected by @xcite .",
    "the blueshifted co emission to the north of the prestellar core may also influence the broadband continuum images , given the relatively broad line widths .",
    "molecular line contamination may thus effectively shift the broadband continuum peak to the north , away from the compact continuum source seen in the aca image , explaining the observed morphology .",
    "however , one clear conclusion is that there are no strong compact continuum sources embedded in the northern , quiescent , part of the prestellar core .",
    "we note that  emission was detected with a high snr toward the prestellar core in the single - dish cso data @xcite with an integrated line intensity in the 25  cso beam of 0.29  k(main beam brightness temperature ) , or 9.4  jy .",
    "the integrated  flux in the aca image is 6.8  jy , indicating that a significant fraction of the single dish flux is in fact recovered by the interferometer .",
    "the combined single - dish and interferometric observations of l1689n presented here show clear evidence of an interaction between the prestellar core seen in the dust continuum and line emission of deuterated molecular tracers , notably , , , and dnc , and the molecular outflow emanating from the nearby solar - type protostar iras  16293 .",
    "_ herschel _ observations of water and singly deuterated ammonia show that the outflow wraps around and largely avoids the prestellar core . a shift in the  line velocity and width is seen across the core , with the narrowest line profiles observed toward the north - eastern part of the core .",
    "we suggest that the shock associated with the outflow has already propagated through this part of the core and we see quiescent , cold , shock - compressed , dense gas , blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity of the cloud .",
    "the western / south - western part of the core is still interacting with the outflow , as evidenced by the broader , more disturbed line profiles .    the  emission observed with the alma compact array shows an elongated distribution , extending south / south - west from the single - dish  peak .",
    "shows a similar morphology , although the peak of the emission is shifted 2.5  east compared to , possibly due to optical depth effects .",
    "the 970  dust continuum emission observed with the aca is offset 5(one aca synthesized beam ) to the south with respect to the  and  emission peaks .",
    "a possible explanation is that the material in the northern part of the core is largely uniformly distributed and has not yet fragmented into compact sources that can lead to a second generation of star formation in the region .",
    "the continuum emission is thus largely resolved out by the interferometer . however , a compact dust source with a size of 1100  au and an  mass of 0.20.4  m  is present in the southern part of the core .",
    "the sensitivity of the current aca  data is not sufficient to determine whether this source is collapsing and the high - snr spectra are affected by the complex hfs .",
    "the observations presented here provide clear evidence of a physical interaction between the prestellar core in l1689n and the blue lobe of one of the outflows driven by iras16293 .",
    "how frequent such interactions may be in nearby low - mass star forming regions is difficult to answer quantitatively .",
    "@xcite suggested that a similar interaction may occur in barnard 1 .",
    "they concluded that that outflows can not sustain the turbulence in the main barnard  1 core , but they are energetic enough to compensate the turbulent energy dissipation in the neighboring , more evolved star forming region ngc1333 .",
    "recent observations of serpens south and ngc1333 @xcite also suggest that outflows are energetically important and provide sufficient energy to sustain turbulence early in the protocluster formation process , without disrupting the entire cluster .",
    "observations of low - mass star forming regions often show bright  emission , assumed to trace cold , dense gas , coinciding with lobes of high - velocity co emission rather than dust continuum peaks , marking the locations of embedded protostars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "most of these  sources have not been studied in enough detail to determine whether they are true interaction regions , or whether they in fact harbor prestellar cores , like is the case in l1689n . @xcite also pointed out that  and  emission often does not peak at the location of embedded protostars , but instead at offset positions , where outflow interactions may occur . in their sample of 6 sources where emission has been detected",
    ", l1689n is the only region where a physical interaction has been clearly demonstrated , but an outflow interaction has also been suggested in barnard  1 @xcite .",
    "another candidate source is located in ngc1333 , at the edge of the blue lobe of the powerful molecular outflow associated with the hh 711 jet @xcite .",
    "however , this source has not yet been studied sufficiently to make a convincing case .    in conclusion ,",
    "the observations presented here demonstrate the utility of the fundamental rotational transitions of deuterated ammonia as an additional tracer of the deeply embedded , pre - stellar phase of star formation .",
    "collisional cross - sections of , , and  with  are now available @xcite , allowing detailed modeling using state - of - the art radiative transfer codes .",
