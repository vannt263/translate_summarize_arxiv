    "the study of stars with masses larger than @xmath10.6 m@xmath0 bypasses difficulties in the treatment of the equation of state and the atmosphere . on the other hand , stars with masses greater than about 1.1 m@xmath0 have a permanent convective core , introducing an additional parameter , the amount of overshooting .",
    "therefore , we expect current stellar evolution models to be able to match the basic properties of stars in the 0.7 - 1.1 m@xmath0 mass range .",
    "in particular , some detached binaries provide very accurate stellar data so they are ideal candidates to critically test sets of theoretical models .",
    "nevertheless , as pointed out by popper ( 1997 ) , _ a serious dilemma appears to be present in the comparison of fundamental stellar properties derived from observations and the predictions of stellar models .",
    "_ in the next sections we review stellar objects ( ebs in the field and in the hyades and one visual binary ) suggesting that current stellar models present some problems around the mass of the sun .",
    "we consider the following detached eclipsing binaries ( debs ) : rt and , hs aur , cg cyg and fl lyr .",
    "we obtain bad fits by fitting both components simultaneously in the hr diagram with padova group ( fagotto et al . 1994 ) or geneva group ( mowlavi et al .",
    "1998 ) models .",
    "either these stellar models are unreliable in this part of the hrd , or the t@xmath2s of ( at least ) the secondaries need revision .",
    "as shown by pols et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , the same difficulty appears with the cambridge group models by fitting simultaneously the effective temperature ( t@xmath2 ) , mass ( @xmath3 ) and radius ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "clausen et al . ( 1999 ) recently reviewed this dilemma with other sets of theoretical models , getting bad fits as well .",
    "+ could the measurements be responsible of this problem ?",
    "the relative error on the individual t@xmath2s of the sample is always small ( @xmath53.5% ) .",
    "however , while the mass and radius of each component of debs can be accurately measured ( 1 - 2% ) , the use of t@xmath2 ( and so luminosity ) is not as reliable because derived indirectly ( from various photometric or spectroscopic indicators ) and thus may explain part of the problem .",
    "lastennet et al .",
    "( 1999a ) , ribas et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , and lastennet , cuisinier & lejeune ( these proceedings ) attempted to carefully re - derive reliable ebs t@xmath2s , but unfortunately none of these works study the stars in question because individual @xmath6 photometry would be necessary .",
    "mass transfer should not be an explanation because none of these stars overflows its roche lobe ( lastennet 1998 ) : hs aur a : @xmath111% , b : @xmath110% ; fl lyr a : @xmath135% , b : @xmath129% ; cg cyg a : @xmath161% , b : @xmath160% ; rt and a : @xmath177% , b : @xmath164% .",
    "nevertheless , for the system rt and , the face - to - face position of the spots on the surface of both components may indicate the possibility of a mass transfer from the primary to the secondary component through a magnetic bridge connecting both active regions ( pribulla et al .",
    "as discussed for instance by lastennet et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , debs members of a star cluster provide stringent constraints on stellar evolution models when the metallicity of the cluster is known .",
    "the eclipsing binary v818 tauri ( a member of the hyades ) contains 2 stars in the 0.7 - 1.1 m@xmath0 mass range ( 1.072@xmath70.769 m@xmath0 , peterson & solensky 1988 ) . once again , a similar analysis for this binary ( lastennet et al .",
    "1999b ) found no padova models fitting simultaneously @xmath3 and @xmath4 ( thus , without using any information on t@xmath2 ) for any age or metallicity .",
    "such a problem was also detected in this mass range by fernandes et al .",
    "( 1998 ) for 85 peg ( 0.91@xmath80.11 m@xmath0@xmath70.73@xmath80.13 m@xmath0 ) , a nearby visual binary star ( @xmath112.4 pc ) .",
    "they found no solution satisfying the constraint of the luminosity ( @xmath9 ) and t@xmath2 for both stars and corresponding to the observed metallicity and sum of the masses .",
    "85 peg a and b appeared to be too cold and/or over - luminous with respect to the zams",
    ". only models with extremely low helium ( @xmath10@xmath50.20 ) and high age ( 20 gyr ) could fit the hr diagram position of 85 peg a , which seems definitively unrealistic since the primordial helium is estimated to be @xmath10@xmath110.232@xmath80.003 ( olive & steigman 1995 ) and the age of the universe to be between 10 - 20 gyr .",
    "they succeeded to fit the 85 peg a position by decreasing @xmath12@xmath13 to about 1.0 but a similar change of @xmath12@xmath13 did nt fit the 85 peg b position . a more recent study ( lebreton et al .",
    "1999 ) shows that including the diffusion , the contribution of the @xmath12-elements , and non lte - effects in low metallicity models help solving the above discrepancy , but there is still a problem to match the mass of the secondary .",
    "a new study of 85 peg is underway ( fernandes et al . , in prep . )",
    "but the influence of rotation can already be excluded because vsin@xmath14 is very low ( vsin@xmath14@xmath55 km.s@xmath15 , according to the catalog of glebocki & stawikowski , 2000 ) .",
    "the systematic discrepancy presented previously is not observed in cd tau c , a solar mass companion of the triple system cd tau : ribas et al .",
    "( 1999 ) obtained a perfect fit of the 3 components with a single isochrone . therefore , except cd tau c ( whose mass still needs an accurate measure ) , the other examples show that there is still great problems for the stellar evolution theory to predict the properties of solar - type stars .",
    "however , this is of first importance for stellar theory to match at least the best known objects ( the sun and non - interacting binary systems ) before any attempt to derive information for star clusters or stellar populations in galaxies . to tackle this problem",
    ", the cesam code ( morel 1997 ) should be very useful to explore the influence of each physical parameter .",
    "cesam performs calculations of 1d quasi - static stellar evolution including diffusion and mass - loss and computes the evolution of stars from the pre - main sequence ( pms ) to the beginning of the red giant branch .    as suggested by clausen et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , the problem briefly presented in the previous sections may be removed ( or at least diminished ) if a significantly lower @xmath16 is adopted for the less massive secondary components . a recent study on v818 tau ( lebreton et al .",
    "2001 ) seem to support this idea and similar tests on the ebs of  2 are in progress ( lastennet & fernandes ) .",
    "we suggest a detailed study of each system to check if there is a solution for a set of ( @xmath16 , @xmath10 , @xmath17 , age ) .",
    "even if the effect of stellar rotation is usually negligible for stars less massive than @xmath11.4 m@xmath0 , an even slightly effect on t@xmath2 and @xmath9 may be relevant for some of these stars ( e.g. vsin@xmath14 @xmath170 km.s@xmath15 for both components of cg cyg ) .",
    "another explanation may be that some of these stars are still in the pms phase , and this is another advantage to use the cesam code which includes this phase .",
    "of course , the number of relevant systems is still very small to give a definitive conclusion .",
    "a photometric and spectroscopic observational campaign of about 50 newly discovered hipparcos ebs at ohp ( france ) , kryonerion ( greece ) and cracow ( poland ) would increase the number of objects ( kurpinska - winiarska & oblak 2000 ) , as well as the dedicated observational program of late f , g and k type stars at the danish 50 cm sat ( la silla obs .",
    ", chile ) which already provided new candidates ( clausen , helt & olsen 1999 ) .",
    "the gaia satellite would also increase the number of stars with individual masses .",
    "halbwachs & arenou ( 1999 ) estimated that the individual masses of 79 double - lined spectroscopic binaries ( sb2s ) - which are not eclipsing binaries - in the 8@xmath18 catalogue of orbital elements of sb systems ( batten et al .",
    "1989 ) would be derived from the gaia astrometric observations .",
    "we expect some of them ( @xmath1 10 according to tab . 1 of halbwachs & arenou ) to belong to the mass range discussed in the present work .",
    "we review solar - type stars showing a clear discrepancy between their fundamental properties and stellar model predictions .",
    "this indicates problems in current stellar evolutionary models because a revision of their t@xmath2 would not solve the disagreement regarding the masses and radii ( see tab .",
    "7 of popper 1997 , or fig . 4 in lastennet et al .",
    "these stars belong to binary systems without interaction so representative of single stars , and it is of first importance for stellar theory to match at least the best known objects ( the sun and non - interacting binary systems ) . in an attempt to solve this problem , we suggest some theoretical explorations , in particular a detailed study of stellar rotation and pms phases .",
    "we also present some projects which should help to increase the limited number of accurate fundamental parameters of detached ebs .",
