    "equilibrium persistent currents ( pc s ) , flowing in normal mesoscopic metallic rings , have been a challenge for both experimentalists and theorists .",
    "the persistent current is a manifestation of the aharonov - bohm effect : it appears when the ring is threaded by a magnetic flux , and it is periodic in the flux enclosed in the ring .",
    "@xcite due to energy - averaging and phase - coherence limitations , one expects to monitor in experiment only the lowest harmonics in the flux quantum @xmath7 .",
    "surprisingly enough , the magnitudes of the pc s measured on huge collections of rings ( @xmath8 copper rings @xcite and @xmath9 silver rings @xcite ) turned out to be larger than those expected theoretically .",
    "the periodicity observed in these large ensembles is @xmath10 , i.e. , half of the magnetic flux quantum . on the other hand , measurements on a single ring@xcite or on a small number@xcite of gold rings",
    "showed the @xmath7 periodicity . in the collection of 30 gold rings@xcite both the the @xmath10 harmonic and the @xmath7 one",
    "were observed .",
    "overall , the sign of the amplitude of the @xmath10 harmonic measured on metallic rings seems to indicate that the low - flux response is diamagnetic.@xcite    in the experiments on ensembles of rings,@xcite the average pc was found by measuring the magnetic moment produced by all rings , which was then divided by the number of rings , @xmath11 , to yield the net average current of a single ring . in most of the experiments@xcite",
    "the magnitude of the average pc , at low temperatures , is roughly of the order of @xmath12 . here",
    "@xmath13 is the thouless energy , @xmath14 is the circumference of the ring and @xmath15 is the diffusion coefficient , where @xmath16 is the elastic mean free path , and @xmath17 is the fermi velocity .",
    "( we consider the diffusive , @xmath18 , case . )",
    "the first theoretical studies of the pc have been carried out on grand - canonical systems of non - interacting electrons.@xcite in these theories , the current in each ring is @xmath7 periodic .",
    "the sign and magnitude of the pc of the individual rings vary randomly due to their high sensitivity to the disorder and to the system s size .",
    "this results in a very small average pc , which is dominated by the exponential factor @xmath19 .",
    "hence , the typical magnitude of the current is predicted to be @xmath20 times the standard deviation of the pc of non - interacting electrons , which at low temperatures is of the order of @xmath12 .",
    "consequently , the persistent current carried by non - interacting electrons is too small to explain the large - ensemble experiments .",
    "similarly , the pc predicted for non - interacting electrons in the canonical ensemble@xcite is substantially too small to explain the observed amplitude of the @xmath10 harmonic .",
    "the theory for interacting electron systems@xcite predicts @xmath10 periodicity of the interaction - dependent part of the pc . according to this theory , the average magnitude of the pc per ring due to interactions is independent of the number of rings .",
    "the total measured pc , divided by @xmath11 , is thus expected to have an @xmath11-independent contribution due to interactions , and an interaction - independent contribution proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "the presence of the @xmath7 harmonic in the measurements performed on a single ring @xcite and on a few@xcite rings , and its absence in large ensembles,@xcite are in agreement with these theoretical predictions .",
    "experiments on a single ring @xcite and on a large ensemble@xcite of semiconducting rings show the @xmath7 and the @xmath10 periodicities respectively , consistent with the arguments given above .    notwithstanding the order of the harmonics , their amplitudes , in particular that of the @xmath10 one , remained unexplained for the large - ensemble measurements . on the other hand , the magnitudes of the @xmath7 harmonic measured in refs . and agree roughly with the prediction for non - interacting electrons , while the pc measured by chandrasekhar _",
    "@xcite turns out to be much larger , however .",
    "here we study the pc of large ensembles , focusing on the role of electronic interactions .",
    "these , attractive and repulsive of reasonable strengths , give rise to comparable magnitudes of the averaged pc ( within an order of magnitude ) , but predict opposite signs .",
    "whereas repulsive electron - electron interactions @xcite result in a paramagnetic response at small magnetic fluxes , attractive interactions yield a diamagnetic response , @xcite as indeed seems to be indicated in the experiments .",
    "the magnitude of the pc predicted for electrons which interact repulsively is smaller@xcite by a factor of about five than , e.g. , the magnitude of the pc measured in copper.@xcite the effective coupling strength of repulsive interactions decreases as the temperature decreases , due to interactions mediated by states whose energies are large compared with the temperature.@xcite this  downwards \" renormalization is the reason for the disagreement between the theory for electrons interacting repulsively and the experiments.@xcite on the other hand , the attractive interaction is normalized  upwards \" at low temperatures , @xcite and eventually leads to a superconducting state .",
    "one expects the magnitude of the averaged pc due to attractive interactions , i.e. , due to superconducting fluctuations , @xcite to increase with the strength of the interaction , or alternatively , to decrease as the ( superconducting ) transition temperature is reduced . since the transition temperatures of metals such as copper , gold , and silver  on which the pc has been measured ",
    "are expected@xcite to be extremely small or zero , ambegaokar and eckern @xcite have employed in their estimates small values of the attractive coupling .",
    "consequently , they came up with a magnitude for the pc which is again smaller by a factor of order five than the measured one.@xcite    in order to reconcile the relatively large interaction required to fit the experiments with the apparent absence of a superconducting transition , we propose that the rings ( of e.g. , copper ) contain a tiny amount of magnetic impurities . we show that a small concentration of these pair - breakers may suffice to hinder the appearance of superconductivity , while hardly affecting the magnitude of the pc .",
    "indeed , it seems that a small amount of magnetic impurities is almost unavoidable in metals like copper .",
    "this is suggested by recent experiments , @xcite aimed to measure the temperature dependence of the dephasing time in noble metal samples .",
    "theoretically , one expects @xcite this rate to vanish as the temperature goes to zero .",
    "however , it was found that the dephasing time may cease to increase below a certain temperature .",
    "this finding was attributed @xcite to the presence of a small concentration of magnetic impurities , which was reported to exist in these samples .",
    "as is well - known , magnetic impurities act as pair breakers , leading to the vanishing of the transition temperature @xmath22 once the spin - scattering rate @xmath23 is larger than the _ bare _ transition temperature of the material _ without _ the magnetic impurities , @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite at the same time , superconducting fluctuations can result in a significant pc provided that the lifetime of a cooper - pair ( @xmath25 at low temperatures ) is larger than the time it takes it to encircle the ring , @xmath26 .",
    "( in the experiments@xcite @xmath27  mk . )",
    "therefore , the observation that the pc is almost unaffected by magnetic impurities while @xmath22 vanishes holds in the range @xmath28 ( from now on we use units in which @xmath29 ) .",
    "it is instructive to write the above condition in terms of lengths , for which eq .",
    "reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 here the magnetic - impurities scattering length @xmath32 is the distance a diffusing electron covers during the time interval @xmath33 . the bulk superconducting coherence length , in the absence of magnetic impurities @xmath34 , is the characteristic distance between two electrons forming a cooper - pair . at low temperatures",
    "a cooper - pair fluctuation can propagate a distance of the order of @xmath32 until it is destroyed due to the scattering by magnetic impurities .",
    "when @xmath35 the pairs are sensitive to the aharonov - bohm flux and consequently contribute significantly to the pc .",
    "when pair breaking occurs on scales smaller than the characteristics distance between two paired electrons , i.e. , when @xmath36 , then the bulk material would not become a superconductor .",
    "therefore , rings made of alloys which are not superconducting in the bulk due to pair breakers , will have pc s due to cooper - pair fluctuations provided that eq .",
    "is satisfied .",
    "we show that the measured amplitude of the @xmath10 harmonic in copper@xcite and gold@xcite rings can be understood theoretically , assuming a minute , less than one part per million , concentration of pair breakers .",
    "similar amounts of magnetic impurities were obtained for the most purified copper and gold samples in ref .  .",
    "we point out that according to our considerations , the measurement of the pc provides a way to estimate @xmath24 , which may well be unreachable by direct experiments .",

    "the effect of pair - breaking is brought about by the presence of magnetic impurities , disregarding the kondo screening of the spins .",
    "obviously one may consider other pair breakers , such as two - level systems , @xcite inelastic scattering,@xcite or magnetic fields.@xcite other effects of magnetic impurities have previously been considered in ref .  .",
    "it was suggested by kravtsov and altshuler@xcite that the measured currents have a different source than the equilibrium pc discussed so far .",
    "a non - equilibrium noise , for example , a stray ac electric field , can cause a dc current by a rectification effect . in ref .",
    "it was shown that the measured signal@xcite may be explained provided that there exists such a non - equilibrium noise .",
    "this mechanism is different than the one suggested by us .",
