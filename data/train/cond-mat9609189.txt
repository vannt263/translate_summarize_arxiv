    "in a previous paper @xcite , we undertook a numerical implementation of methods proposed by munn and silbey @xcite for the determination of polaron properties in the presence of simultaneous local and nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling , local coupling being defined as a nontrivial dependence of the exciton site energies on lattice coordinates and nonlocal coupling as a nontrivial dependence of the exciton transfer integral on lattice coordinates .",
    "those methods were essentially perturbative , with the coefficients of a canonical transformation being fixed so as to limit the secular growth with the temperature of the perturbation remaining after transformation .",
    "the present work is motivated by several limitations of those methods that were found in the course of our prior work @xcite : 1 ) since the munn - silbey method was motivated by an interest in controlling perturbations at high temperatures , one should not necessarily expect the method to produce the best description of polaron states at low temperatures .",
    "2 ) since the method is perturbative , it is reasonable to expect that the description of the polaron ground state so obtained could be improved .",
    "3 ) since the self - consistency equations on which the method is based do not involve the exciton transfer integral , it is questionable whether the method can be relied upon beyond the very narrow band regime .",
    "4 ) since the results of our numerical investigation showed some significant differences with analytical results based on the same underlying methods , as well as with some other recent analyses @xcite-@xcite , it would appear desirable to have corroboration of our results by independent methods .",
    "the central findings of our prior work @xcite , that polaron binding energies may be much larger than previously thought , and polaron bands much narrower , underscores the importance of independent corroboration , since such findings are of central importance to understanding the influence of nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling on the nature of polaron states and of polaron transport .    simultaneous local and nonlocal coupling appears to be particularly important in the characterization of solid - state excimers , where a variety of experimental and theoretical considerations suggest that a strong dependence of electronic tunneling upon certain coordinated distortions of neighboring molecules ( nonlocal exction - phonon coupling ) is crucial to the formation of excited bound states @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we approach the problem of simultaneous local and nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling by variational methods .",
    "our central interest in this paper is in the polaron energy band , computed as @xmath0 wherein @xmath1 is the total crystal momentum label , @xmath2 is an appropriately normalized delocalized trial state , and @xmath3 is the system hamiltonian .",
    "it should be noted that the trial states we use are eigenfunctions of the appropriate total momentum operator , so that variations for distinct @xmath1 are independent , and the set of @xmath4 so produced constitute a variational estimate ( upper bound ) for the polaron energy band @xcite .    as our system hamiltonian , we choose perhaps the simplest one embracing exciton tunneling and simultaneous local and nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling , a slight generalzation of the traditional holstein hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "@xmath5 @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 in which @xmath9 creates an exciton in the rigid - lattice wannier state at site @xmath10 , and @xmath11 creates a quantum of vibrational energy in the einstein oscillator at site @xmath10 .",
    "both excitons and phonons are treated as bosons .",
    "the einstein frequency is given by @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the exciton transfer integral between nearest neighbor sites , @xmath14 is the local coupling strength , and @xmath15 is the nonlocal coupling strength characterizing phonon assisted transfers between nearest neighbor sites .",
    "all of the methods used in this paper can be applied as well to common generalizations of this hamiltonian , involving , for example , phonon dispersion , exciton transfers beyond nearest neighbors , and/or different exciton - phonon coupling geometry .",
    "in ref  @xcite we considered both _",
    "antisymmetric _ nonlocal coupling , as above , and _ symmetric _ nonlocal coupling , in which all nonlocal coupling terms would be of the same algebraic sign .",
    "these two kinds of coupling represent different physical circumstances .",
    "antisymmetric coupling , for example , would be appropriate to the description of certain librations that promote exciton transfers between neighboring molecules when these molecules tilt toward each other , effectively decreasing the gap through which tunneling must take place .",
    "this has the consequence that tunneling between a molecule and its neighbor to the right ( for example ) is promoted ( and tunneling on the left inhibited ) when the librator tilts to the right , and tunneling on the left is promoted ( and tunneling on the right inhibited ) when the librator tilts to the left .",
    "symmetric coupling , on the other hand , describes the circumstance in which tunneling between a molecule and its neighbors on both the left and right is promoted during the same phase of oscillation and inhibited during the complementary phase ; this may happen , for example , if the strength with which a mobile exciton is bound varies with the coordinate described by the oscillator . in this paper , we restrict our attention to antisymmetric nonlocal coupling .    in momentum space , these several terms take the form @xmath16",
    "@xmath17 @xmath18 where @xmath19,\\ ] ]    throughout this paper , we use the the fourier conventions for ladder operators @xmath20 , etc . and scalars @xmath21 , etc .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 to assist in the interpretation of the various formulas to follow , we denote exciton wave vectors by latin @xmath24 s , phonon wave vectors by latin @xmath25 s , and reserve the greek @xmath1 for the total crystal momentum label .    also throughout this paper",
    ", we use the einstein frequency as the scale of the energy , so that all energies are dimensionless .",
    "this leaves us with a three - dimensional parameter space in which a general point may be identified as @xmath26 .",
    "a complete exploration of the @xmath27 parameter space is far beyond the scope of this paper , so we must narrow our focus significantly . since our principal interest here is in nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling ,",
    "we defer an in - depth discussion of the @xmath28 plane to other work . since we wish to compare our present results with those of the munn - silbey method , we present results for the @xmath29 plane in a manner that closely follows prior work .",
    "since the regime of strong nonlocal coupling has received much less attention than that of local coupling , we present a more systematic survey of the @xmath30 plane , including a phase diagram and a discussion of characteristic polaron structures and the nonlocal - coupling version of the self - trapping transition . finally , we present sample results for general points in the @xmath31 space .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows . as a preliminary study",
    ", we briefly touch upon the application of the small polaron ansatz to nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling , as was originally suggested by merrifield in his 1964 paper @xcite , but was never carried out .",
    "toyozawa s ansatz is then introduced to examine the same problem in greater depth .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to exploring the parameter space under toyozawa s ansatz , and a comparison of our present results with comparable results of the munn - silbey approach @xcite is made .",
    "we must emphasize that these comparisons are not to the original analytical calculations of munn and silbey @xcite , but to our own implementation of their approach by numerical methods @xcite .",
    "since the results of our numerical study differed quantitatively and qualitatively from the original calculations of munn and silbey in some significant respects and thereby generalized them , it is important in the following to distinguish between the munn - silbey _ method _ and our own numerical _ results _ obtained by this method .",
    "as in merrifield s original calculation , the normalized small polaron trial state may be written @xmath32 |0\\rangle,\\ ] ] @xmath33 |0\\rangle .\\ ] ] this trial state may be viewed as a phased sum over `` form factors '' describing local exciton - phonon correlations .",
    "the form factor in this case is the product of an exciton completely localized on a single lattice site and a lattice function defined _ relative to _ the exciton .    using this trial state",
    ", we form the expectation value of the hamiltonian and minimize the total energy @xmath34 with respect to the phonon amplitudes , yielding the self - consistency equations @xmath35 @xmath36 , \\ ] ] @xmath37 @xmath38 in which @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the magnitude and phase of the debye - waller factor ( see section iii ) .",
    "it is evident from ( [ eq : sce ] ) that unlike the original work of merrifield restricted to local coupling only @xcite , @xmath41 here can not be taken to be real owing to the presence of nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling .",
    "the phonon mode amplitude @xmath42 is real for all @xmath1 and @xmath25 when @xmath43 ; when @xmath44 , @xmath45 is real only along the lines defined by @xmath46 = 0 $ ] , among which is the @xmath47 line .    using a numerical iteration scheme , we may solve the above set of self - consistency equations to desired precision without any artificial constraints .",
    "for all values of local and nonlocal coupling strengths , we found our final solutions to be insensitive to our choice of both numerical method and states used to initialize calculation . for the purpose of illustration",
    ", we may express @xmath48 in terms of two real matrices @xmath49 as in ref  @xcite : @xmath50.\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ eq : sce ] ) it follows that @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath25-independence of @xmath39 suggests that the @xmath52 and @xmath53 matrices may be more similar in shape than we found in our numerical implementation of the munn - silbey method @xcite ; moreover , since @xmath1-dependence of @xmath39 can be relatively weak in some regimes , the difference between @xmath52 and @xmath53 can be quite small .",
    "results of such calculations for weak nonlocal coupling @xmath54 are indicated in fig .",
    "[ f4.1 ] . only @xmath55 is displayed since @xmath39 in this case varies by only a fraction of a percent across the entire brillouin zone so that @xmath56 would be indistinguishable from @xmath57 . since",
    "nonlocal coupling is weak relative to local coupling in this particular example , it follows as well that @xmath58 .",
    "the weak asymmetry of @xmath59 ( @xmath57 ) with respect to @xmath25 at intermediate values of @xmath1 implies ( through eq .",
    "[ eq : phi ] ) that the debye - waller phase @xmath40 varies slightly with @xmath1 ; however , this weak non - constancy of @xmath40 has little direct influence over the properties of the solution both because of the smallness of @xmath40 and the small value of the nonlocal coupling constant .",
    "= 4.8 in    antisymmetric nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling introduces characteristic distortions in quantities such as @xmath60 and the polaron energy band .",
    "these distortions are `` bimodal '' with respect to the total crystal momentum @xmath61 in the sense that this modulation characteristically is most pronounced at intermediate values of @xmath62 .",
    "with respect to the phonon wave vector , these distortions characteristically are most pronounced at @xmath63 , indicating that the strongest exciton - phonon coupling involves lattice dimerization . on the other hand",
    ", @xmath60 is weakly structured at low phonon wave vectors , and is in fact equal to unity along @xmath64 , consistent with the lattice `` sum rule '' @xmath65    the polaron band energy @xmath34 can be calculated from @xmath66 comparison between the small polaron band and that calculated numerically from the munn - silbey approach @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ f4.2 ] for the case of @xmath67 .",
    "= 3.2 in    the munn - silbey method yields a flatter and lower energy band than does the small - polaron method ; however , since the perturbative result falls below the variational result , no conclusion can be drawn as to which approach gives the better polaron band ; for example , without further information we can not exclude the possibility that the actual ground state band might lie between these two results and closer to the variational band .",
    "higher - quality variations are needed to make such determinations .    through its fourier transform",
    ", the nonuniformity of @xmath55 with respect to @xmath25 ( though small on an absolute scale in this case ) implies a spreading of phonon distortion in site space even in the absence of a direct transfer integral @xmath13 . with increasing nonlocal coupling , the amplitude of this distortion increases , as does its spread in real space .",
    "since nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling provides the only transport mechanism when @xmath68 , it is reasonable to expect in analogy with the usual small polaron picture ( e.g. , as in ref .",
    "@xcite ) that a small polaron approach such as this one may break down when nonlocal coupling becomes comparable in strength to local coupling .    at the least ,",
    "the approach sketched here needs to be generalized to admit wave function symmetries more consistent with the dimeric structures favored by nonlocal coupling .",
    "this could be done in a minimal way by building up trial bloch states from dimeric form factors ; we elect , however , to skip this step and proceed to a still more flexible trial state introduced by toyozawa that is well known in the context of local - coupling polaron theory .",
    "the major shortcoming of the small polaron ansatz is the fact that it is built up from form factors in which the electronic component is completely localized on a single lattice site . in the presence of significant exciton tunneling , or , as we have observed , in the presence of significant nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling , it would appear reasonable to expect self - consistent local exciton - phonon correlations to reflect at least some of the characteristics of spreading wave packets . to accommodate this expecatation ,",
    "the completely - localized exciton component of the small polaron form factor can be generalized to a superposition of exciton amplitudes to be determined self - consistently with the amplitudes of the lattice oscillators .",
    "this is the basis of many theories characterizable as `` large polaron '' theories .",
    "important among these for our purposes are delocalized - state theories based on phased sums of such generalized form factors ( historically identified with toyozawa ) , and localized - state theories based upon using such generalized form factors as trial states in their own right without invoking the phased - sum construction that assures delocalization ( historically identified with pekar @xcite and davydov @xcite )",
    ".    toyozawa s ansatz may be viewed as a delocalization of the davydov ansatz @xmath69 @xmath70 where @xmath71 denotes the direct product , and @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the exciton and phonon part of the form factor respectively , built from exciton and phonon vacua @xmath74 and @xmath75 as @xmath76 @xmath77 |0\\rangle_{ph } .\\ ] ] after delocalization one obtains toyozawa s ansatz state , given by @xmath78 @xmath79 |0\\rangle\\ ] ] @xmath80 |0 \\rangle .\\ ] ] where @xmath81 . the auxiliary vector @xmath82 is not normalized , but simplifies presentation of some results . it may be worth noting that many localized - state approaches such as the davydov theory take the exciton component @xmath72 to be normalized such that @xmath83 , since in this approach the norm of exciton amplitudes has a physical interpetation as the exciton number . in the delocalized - state approach , however , the norm of the exciton amplitudes does not have this physical meaning , and by contributing only a multiplicative factor to @xmath84 , makes no contribution to the normalized trial state .",
    "consequently , the norm of the amplitudes @xmath85 is arbitrary , and in fact drifts in the course of numerical variation ; since this drift has no physical consequences , we have found it convenient throughout this paper to normalize the exciton amplitudes such that @xmath86 .    for variational calculations we require the total energy associated with each trial state , for which we evaluate the expectation values of the three principal terms in the holstein hamiltonian : @xmath87 @xmath88 @xmath89 here",

    "these are to be distinguished from the franck - condon factor @xmath94 which quantifies the overlap between the lattice component of the polaron wavefunction with the undistorted phonon ground state .",
    "the debye waller factors @xmath95 ( @xmath96 of section ii ) , appear routinely in the transport terms of effective ( small ) polaron hamiltonians , where they strongly influence the renormalization of the effective mass . in the general case",
    "we address here , the spread of the exciton amplitudes @xmath97 causes debye - waller factors between non - nearest - neighbor sites to contribute to polaron structure in complex ways .    owing to the large number of debye - waller factors that may be involved in the general case , their resolution into magnitudes and phases as in section ii ceases to be advantageous .",
    "one can show from ( [ eq : skk ] ) and ( [ eq : skn ] ) that @xmath98 is strictly real , so that computation is simplified by abandoning the magnitude and phase characterization and working in momentum space with the real quantities @xmath90 .",

    "the effect of nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling is most evident when @xmath13 is small or absent .",

    "= 3.2 in    though still imperfect , the energy band comparison is much more favorable here than we found in section ii .",

    "our present results based on toyozawa s ansatz give the best estimate of the polaron ground state energy among the three we consider , and can be viewed as corroborating our prior numerical calculations by the munn - silbey method , at least when nonlocal coupling dominates . due to the variational nature of toyozawa s ansatz ,",
    "it is now safe to say that the munn - silbey approach over estimates the ground state energy at @xmath122 .",
    "in this section we put local coupling aside ( i.e. , we set @xmath123 ) , and focus on the interplay between exciton tunneling ( @xmath13 ) and nonlocal coupling ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "we have seen that although nonlocal coupling is an exciton - phonon interaction that supports polaron formation , it is also a transport mechanism and competes with local coupling both by promoting transport and by driving the exciton - lattice correlations toward dimeric structures rather than the site - localized structures preferred by local coupling interactions . on the other hand , although nonlocal coupling is a transport mechanism , it also competes with direct , phonon - free exciton transfers since the lattice distortions inherent in phonon - assisted transfers inhibit direct transfers .",
    "it is convenient to use the device of a phase diagram to organize our discussion .",
    "fig  [ f4.5 ] depicts the @xmath124 plane at @xmath123 , in which we have indicated two narrow , tongue - shaped regions that divide the plane into two more - or - less distinct regions , a _ strong _ nonlocal coupling region occupying the upper portion of the diagram and a _ weak _ nonlocal coupling region occupying the lower .",
    "the phenomena indicated by these tongues can be characterized as a kind of self - trapping .",
    "= 3.2 in    in the more familiar self - trapping phenomenon associated with local exciton - phonon coupling , a polaron is understood to be characterized by exciton - phonon correlations that are more - or - less spatially compact . for `` weak '' local coupling",
    ", correlations may extend over many lattice sites , corresponding to a `` large '' polaron . with increasing local coupling strength",
    ", the width of the correlated region diminishes until the excitation is essentially confined to a single lattice site , corresponding to a `` small '' polaron . along the way",
    ", other polaron properties change as well , most notably the polaron effective mass growing from the free mass at weak coupling to values arbitrarily large in the strong coupling region .",
    "whether this change as a function of system parameters is necessarily smooth or may occur discontinuously is a subject of some contention @xcite ; nonetheless , it is common for approximate treatments to find the change to be discontinuous in some regimes , and hence the imprecise notion of a discrete `` self - trapping transition '' is widespread .",
    "more important than the question of continuity is the fact that in the vicinity of this transition , exciton - phonon correlations and related physical quantities such as the effective mass undergo strong changes with relatively small changes in control parameters .",
    "the qualitative characteristics of this familiar self - trapping transition apply as well to our treatment of nonlocal coupling .",
    "we find a discrete transition to occur in the vicinity of the brillouin zone _ center _ , bearing some resemblance to the more familiar local coupling phenomenon ; however , we also find a discrete transition occurring in the vicinity of the zone _",
    "edge_. moreover , whereas the usual conception of self - trapping focusses on dramatic changes that occur at the brillouin zone center ( e.g. , the jump in the effective mass ) leading to the notion of a _ sharp _ transition , we find the discrete transitions in both the inner and outer zones to be _ broad _ in a sense to be described presently .",
    "we must now attempt to be precise in specifying the meaning of `` discrete transition '' in the present context , for clarity focussing on the inner - zone transition .    at an arbitrarily chosen point @xmath125 in parameter space , there exist one or more minima in the variational energy @xmath4 for each @xmath1 , the lowest of which identifies the global energy minimum in each total momentum sector ; the collection of energies for all @xmath1 identifies the polaron energy band @xmath4 at @xmath125 , and the collection of _ states _ associated with these global energy minima constitute the polaron bloch states .",

    ". what may be less clear to this point is what relationship , if any , exists between this transition phenomenon and the more traditional notion of a discrete self - trapping transition .",

    "it is possible to connect this traditional perspective of a @xmath135 transition with our present @xmath1-dependent transition through the dependence of @xmath132 upon the system parameters @xmath125 .",

    "this surgery consists of discarding the higher - lying of the coexisting variational energy minima in the interval @xmath137 and the states associated with them , retaining only those yielding the lowest energy at every @xmath1 .",

    "polaron bands are determined without necessity of surgery ; however this qualitative characterization of the @xmath1 dependence of the polaron band as being more large - polaron - like at long wave lengths and more small - polaron - like at short wave lengths continues to apply .",
    "the outer - zone transition is qualitatively similar in most respects , except that instead of going to zero in some limit , the @xmath132 associated with the transition can be pushed to the brillouin zone edge , and the polaron states on each side of the transition differ from those of the inner - zone transition in some characteristic ways addressed later in this section .",
    "the tongue - shaped regions indicated on the phase diagram in figure [ f4.5 ] identify parameters associated with such discrete transitions ; the upper , wider tongue is associated with the inner - zone transition , and the lower , more narrow tongue with the outer - zone transition . where the tongues overlap , discrete transitions are found to occur in the inner and outer zones simultaneously , such that the same energy band embraces distinct polaron states in the inner , intermediate , and outer brillouin zone .",
    "the way in which these discrete transitions depend on the parameters @xmath13 and @xmath15 can be sketched qualitatively as follows : for fixed @xmath13 sufficiently large , a finite @xmath132 first appears as @xmath15 is increased from zero to the weak - coupling boundary of the zone - center transition region .",
    "as @xmath15 is further increased , this finite @xmath132 decreases until at the strong - coupling boundary of the zone - center transition @xmath132 vanishes , identifying the _ strong - coupling _ boundary with the usual notion of a discrete self - trapping transition occurring at the zone center .",
    "transits across the outer - zone transition region have a similar structure .",
    "we can study the nature of the `` large '' and `` small '' polaron states associated with nonlocal coupling by examining the structure of typical states at selected points in the system parameter space .",
    "we turn first to the inner - zone transition and specifically the point @xmath138 .",
    "this point is near the strong - coupling edge of the transition region , where two distinct classes of stable states exist in a small interval around @xmath113 .",

    "[ f4.6 ] do not differ markedly , although upon close observation the exciton and phonon amplitudes of the `` small polaron '' state ( solid curves ) do decay somewhat more rapidly than do those of the large polaron state ( dashed curves ) .",
    "a feature more characteristic of the difference between the large and small polaron states in the presence of nonlocal coupling is the fact that amplitudes in the small polaron state are characterized by more or stronger alternations of sign than are found in the large polaron state .",
    "although these alternations are ultimately due to the antisymmetric nature of the nonlocal coupling used in this paper , their greater prominance on the strong - coupling side of the zone - center transition is consistent with the more compact exciton - phonon correlations typical of small polarons .",
    "next we turn to the outer - zone transition , and specifically the point @xmath141 .",
    "this point is near the strong - coupling edge of the transition region , where two distinct classes of stable states exist in the neighborhood of @xmath142 .",

    "[ f4.10 ] are obtained when this point @xmath143 is approached from the strong - coupling regime , while the dashed curves are obtained by approaching from the weak - coupling regime .",
    "a significant feature of the zone - edge solutions is that the phonon amplitudes can be resolved into two components ; one component is a strongly localized asymmetric lattice distortion as we have seen in all the other nonlocal coupling scenarios , and the other component is a nearly - uniform plane wave .",
    "the zone - edge transition can be viewed as a binding or unbinding of the free - phonon component suggested by this plane wave . in the large polaron regime _ below _",
    "the transition ( higher @xmath1 , weaker coupling ) , the plane - wave component dominates the phonon amplitudes , while after crossing over into the small polaron regime ( lower @xmath1 , stronger coupling ) , this plane - wave component is absent .    in the particular solution",
    "illustrated , the plane - wave component has the wave vector @xmath144 , consistent with the notion of a zone - edge solution in which the phonon component carries all the crystal momentum .",
    "more generally , however , the wave vector of the plane wave component is not given strictly by @xmath145 , but by @xmath146 , still reflecting a state in which the phonon component carries all the crystal momentum .",
    "the latter property suggests that outer - zone states on the weak coupling side of this transition are not simply large polaron states as we might otherwise characterize them , but mixtures of large polarons essentially at rest and `` unbound '' free phonons .",
    "= 3.2 in = 3.2 in    the changes in polaron structure that occur as @xmath13 is varied from small through large values at ( relatively ) fixed @xmath15 , can be seen in figures [ f4.3]a and [ f4.7 ] ; corresponding changes in the polaron energy band are illustrated in figure [ f4.11 ] .",
    "the particular value of @xmath15 used in this illustration was chosen to be significant on an absolute scale , but to fall below both the zone - center and zone - edge transitions ; this corresponds to a large polaron region in the sense that applies to nonlocal coupling .",
    "= 3.2 in    at @xmath147 , the structure of the polaron state is essentially identical to that shown in fig  [ f4.3]a , with slightly larger amplitudes and weaker decays due to the somewhat larger value of @xmath15 .",
    "the energy band at this point ( see figure [ f4.11 ] ) has a strongly bimodal variation characterized by a negative effective mass at the zone center .",
    "these qualitative characteristics of the polaron state and energy band are characteristic of the small @xmath13 regime . at @xmath148 ,",
    "on the other hand , the exciton density is essentially completely localized on the two central sites , essentially vanishing elsewhere .",
    "this coincides with a critcal flattening of the polaron energy band at the zone center resulting in a loss of the bimodal band structure and a divergence of the effective mass through negative values . with further increases in @xmath13 , e.g. to @xmath149 ,",
    "the exciton amplitudes again spread in space with a structure dominated by @xmath13 , and the energy band is unimodal with a finite , positive effective mass .",
    "allowing the simultaneous action of local and nonlocal coupling in the presence of finite transfer integrals should lead to polaron structures and energy bands that blend the qualities seen in figures [ f4.3 ] and [ f4.8 ] ( @xmath68 ; @xmath150 finite ) and figures [ f4.6 ] , [ f4.10 ] , [ f4.7 ] , and [ f4.11 ] ( @xmath123 ; @xmath151 finite ) .",

    "= 3.2 in = 3.2 in    in the absence of the transfer integral ( @xmath68 ) , the phonon displacement is mostly localized on a single site due to the dominance of local exciton - phonon coupling in this case .",
    "the effect of nonlocal coupling shows both in the nontrivial spread of the exciton and phonon amplitudes in space ( phonon - assisted transport ) and in the alternations in sign that persist , though weakened by competition with local coupling .",
    "increasing the transfer integral @xmath13 results in increased spreading that further smoothes both the exciton and phonon amplitudes . at @xmath152 , all amplitudes are positive , and the influence of nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling is evident only in the asymmetry of the exciton distribution and its lattice distortion .    in the absence of the transfer integral",
    ", toyozawa s ansatz and the munn - silbey approach yield very similar polaron energy bands , though the variational approach based on toyozawa s ansatz is hereby established as quantitatively superior .",
    "it is well to ask , however , _ how _ superior the present method is , and under what circumstances that difference makes a practical difference .",
    "the first _",
    "semi_-quantitative conclusion in this regard is that the quantitative discrepancies increase with the transfer integral , confirming one of our expectations that motivated this work ; the nature of this trend can be seen in a comparison of the lower curves of figure  [ f4.8 ] ( both methods for @xmath121 ) with the curves of figure  [ f4.9 ] ( both methods for @xmath153 ) .",
    "= 3.2 in    whether the discrepancies illustrated in figure  [ f4.9 ] are significant depends on the purpose to which a band structure calculation is to be put .",
    "the typical `` gap '' between the two results is roughly 0.18 in units of the einstein frequency , 0.09 in units of the rigid lattice energy bandwidth , or about 0.75 in units of the resulting polaron energy band width . for einstein frequencies typical of molecular phonons , a shift of 0.18",
    "is easily resolved by optical spectroscopies , so for such purposes one would certainly want to use the present method . on the other hand ,",
    "the absolute position of the energy band is of less importance to other purposes ; for example , energy transport in the band regime is more sensitive to the _ shape _ of the energy band than to its position .",
    "the gross shapes of the two energy bands in figure  [ f4.9 ] are similar , though there are signficant differences ; for example , the `` energy barrier '' separating the two finite-@xmath1 minima is more than twice as large when computed by the present method , while the `` effective mass '' ( at @xmath113 or at the finite-@xmath1 minima ) is less than half that computed by the munn - silbey method .",
    "in this paper we have obtained variational estimates of the ground state energy bands for the holstein hamiltonian incorporating simultaneous local and nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling .",
    "we have examined the interplay between the transfer integral @xmath13 and local and nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling , with an emphasis on nonlocal coupling effects .",
    "the most obvious effect of nonlocal exciton - phonon coupling is a bimodal distortion of the polaron energy band that is most obvious in the limit of small exciton transfer integral and small local exciton - phonon coupling .",
    "moreover , since nonlocal coupling is a transfer mechanism , a non - trivial polaron energy band remains even when both the transfer integral and local coupling vanish .",
    "the polaron structure induced by local coupling is `` site centered '' , while that induced by nonlocal coupling is `` bond centered '' . when local and nonlocal coupling act in concert , the microscopic forces associated with each superpose with the result that polaron structure is neither completely site - centered nor completely bond centered .",
    "the nature of these interactions is such , however , that nonlocal coupling must be relatively strong before a bond - centered component becomes noticeable against the typically more prominent site - centered component driven by local coupling .",
    "this latter quality is consistent with findings of other analyses of solid - state excimers , where strong nonlocal coupling was found to be an essential element in producing the dimeric lattice distortions characteristic of excimers as well as other excimeric properties .    like polarons born of local coupling only , polarons embracing simultaneous local and nonlocal coupling experience self - trapping transitions , manifested in our present calculations as in many other approximate treatments by discontinuities in the dependence of some polaron properties on system parameters . unlike the traditional perspective that focusses on the change in the @xmath113 polaron state as some `` self - trapping line ''",
    "is crossed in the @xmath154 plane , our analysis shows that the traditional notion of self - trapping is a limiting one , the self - trapping line corresponding to a one - dimensional boundary of a three - dimensional volume in the @xmath125 space in which a more general , @xmath1-dependent self - trapping occurs .",
    "this more general self - trapping phenomenon is associated with polaron bands that are large - polaron - like in the inner portion of the brillouin zone and small - polaron - like in the outer portion of the brillouin zone , the traditional self - trapping corresponding to the limit in which the large - polaron - like region vanishes .",
    "this characterization of self - trapping continues to hold in the @xmath155 plane , where the local coupling underlying the traditional self - trapping concept no longer exists .",
    "in addition to generalizing the traditional self - trapping concept , we find a second type of transition phenomenon occurring near the brillouin zone boundary . rather than constituting a small - to - large polaron type of transition , this phenomeon appears to reflect the binding or unbinding of a free phonon .",
    "while conveniently described as `` transitions '' , each of these phenomena are best understood as reflecting rapid but smooth changes in polaron structure that are `` marked '' by discontinuties only because of the approximate nature of our method .",
    "for example , there is no reason to expect that the `` critical point '' of one of these transitions has any special meaning other than marking the point at which the changes in polaron structure first occur too rapidly to be accurately represented by our particular calculation method , permitting discontinuities to appear .",
    "this quality of self - trapping transitions will receive greater attention elsewhere @xcite .    for small exciton transfer integrals ( @xmath156 ) , toyozawa s ansatz and the munn - silbey approach yield very similar polaron energy bands ; however , these bands grow increasingly dissimilar with increasing transfer integral . in all cases studied , we have found the variational approach based on toyozawa s ansatz to yield polaron energy bands lower than those of the munn - silbey method at all @xmath1 , establishing the variational energy bands as the quantitatively superior results .    without generalization , the methods used in this paper apply to the limit of zero temperatures .",
    "the munn - sibley method , on the other hand , was constructed with the aim of maintaining a sound perturbation theory at finite temperatures .",
    "considering the quality of the comparison between the results of our present method and those of the munn - silbey method at zero temperature where the latter is _ not _ at its best , we would speculate that a direct , numerical implementation of the munn - silbey method would provide a sound approach at finite temperatures , provided that exciton transfer integrals are small relative to both local and nonlocal coupling .",
    "the variational approach we have employed here needs to be generalized in order to reach more reliable conclusions about the finite - temperature scenario @xcite .",
