    "<S> we propose a model for the production and suppression of j/@xmath0 mesons in high - energy hadronic collisions . we factorized the process into a production of the @xmath1 pairs of relative momentum @xmath2 convoluted with a transition probability from the produced @xmath1 pairs into the observed j/@xmath0 mesons . as the produced @xmath1 pairs exit the nuclear matter </S>",
    "<S> , the multiple scattering between the colored @xmath3 and @xmath4 and the nuclear medium increases the square of the relative momentum between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 , @xmath5 , such that some of the @xmath1 pairs gain enough invariant mass to transmute into open charm states . with only one parameter , </S>",
    "<S> the amount of energy gained by the produced @xmath1 pair per unit length in the nuclear medium , our model can fit all observed j/@xmath0 suppression data including recent na50 data from pb - pb collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> the suppression of j/@xmath0 production in high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions has been suggested as a potential signal for the existence of the quark - gluon plasma @xcite . in recent years , strong j/@xmath0 suppression has been observed in high energy hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions by a number of experiments @xcite ; and various theoretical explanations of the observed j/@xmath0 suppression have been proposed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the na50 collaboration at cern observed a much stronger j/@xmath0 suppression in pb - pb collisions at sps energies @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been argued that a `` conventional '' approach can not explain this new data , and debates and controversies on the theorized origin of the suppression have reached a new level @xcite . in this letter , using the same mechanism proposed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for the j/@xmath0 suppression in hadron - nucleus collision , we explain the newly observed strong j/@xmath0 suppression in high energy pb - pb collisions .    the production of j/@xmath0 mesons in high energy hadronic collisions is believed to have two factorizable stages : the production of @xmath1 pairs , and the formation of j/@xmath0 mesons from the produced @xmath1 pairs . due to the large mass of the charm quark , the @xmath1 pair production should be a short - distance process in nature , and therefore calculable with perturbative methods . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the formation of j/@xmath0 mesons from the initially compact @xmath1 pairs takes a relatively long time and is nonperturbative @xcite . throughout the years </S>",
    "<S> , the main debate on the mechanism of j/@xmath0 production has focused on the second stage . </S>",
    "<S> three models are commonly used in the literature for calculating the cross sections of j/@xmath0 production : the color evaporation model ( cem ) @xcite , the color - singlet model ( csm ) @xcite , and the color - octet model ( com ) @xcite . since the data on j/@xmath0 suppression in nucleus - nucleus collisions </S>",
    "<S> are presented in terms of total cross sections @xcite , we will focus the remainder of our discussions on the total production rate of j/@xmath0 mesons in hadronic collisions at fixed target energies . </S>",
    "<S> for calculating the j/@xmath0 production rate , we propose a simple model which is general enough to admit any of the three possible formation mechanisms mentioned above .    for the collisions between hadrons ( or nuclei ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath6 and @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the total j/@xmath0 cross section can be factorized as follows , @xmath9 where the four - vector @xmath10 is the total momentum of the produced @xmath1 pair . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fact ] ) , the variable @xmath11 is equal to the square of the relative momentum between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 in their rest frame , @xmath12 . if the @xmath3 and @xmath4 can be approximated as on their mass - shell , @xmath13 , and we have @xmath14 . without trying to separate contributions from different color channels , </S>",
    "<S> we define the @xmath15 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fact ] ) to be a transition probability for a color - averaged @xmath1 pair of the relative momentum square @xmath11 to evolve into a physical j/@xmath0 meson . </S>",

    "<S> ( [ model ] ) , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are to be fixed by fitting the existing total production cross section data from hadron - hadron collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> the transition probabilities in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) represent a wide range of j/@xmath0 formation mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 implies that all @xmath1 pairs with invariant mass below the open charm threshold have the same ( c ) probability to become the physical j/@xmath0 mesons , which is effectively the same as the color evaporation model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath21 corresponds to following assumptions : the transition amplitude @xmath22 does not involve any radiation and interaction with the medium , and it is then proportional to the j/@xmath0 wave function parameterized as a ( g ) . </S>",
    "<S> if we neglect the @xmath11-dependence in the production of the @xmath1 pairs in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fact ] ) , and require the @xmath1 to be color - singlet , the total cross section with @xmath21 is effectively the same as that from the color - singlet model @xcite .    if the j/@xmath0 mesons are formed after a long - time expansion from the small size @xmath1 pairs , and radiating soft gluons adjusts the color of the pairs , it is then natural to assume that the @xmath11-dependence of the transition probability is associated with that radiation , and to choose a ( p ) distribution , @xmath23 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ power ] ) , for the transition probability . </S>",
    "<S> if we expand the transition probability at @xmath24 , the normalization of @xmath23 can be related to the combination of the matrix elements in the color - octet model @xcite .    in principle , with a different functional form of @xmath25 , our factorized formula in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fact ] ) can be generalized to calculate the cross sections for producing other quarkonium states .    to evaluate the j/@xmath0 total cross section in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fact ] ) , we need to calculate the production rate for the @xmath1 pairs at invariant mass @xmath26 . as argued in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , the production rate can be factorized into a convolution of two parton distributions from the two incoming hadrons and a short - distance hard part , @xmath27 , which represents the perturbatively calculable hard parts for the parton @xmath28 and @xmath29 to produce the @xmath1 pairs with mass @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the total drell - yan cross section , the one - scale cross section @xmath30 for producing the @xmath1 pairs at the fixed target energies should be well - represented by the leading order calculations in @xmath31 , and the high order corrections are given by a smooth k - factor . at the leading order in @xmath31 , </S>",
    "<S> the partonic contributions come from two subprocesses : @xmath32 and @xmath33 . with the k - factor for effective high order contributions , the total j/@xmath0 cross section in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fact ] ) can be written as @xcite @xmath34 where @xmath35 runs over all parton flavors , and @xmath36 . </S>",
    "<S> because of the two - parton final - state at the leading order , the incoming parton momentum fractions are fixed by the kinematics , and given by @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsec ] ) , the short - distance hard parts for producing the @xmath1 pairs , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , are given in refs .  @xcite . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsec ] ) , the integration limits of @xmath41 are chosen to be consistent with the data , and the limits of @xmath11 are specified by the functional form of @xmath15 in eq .  </S>",

    "<S> eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsec ] ) combining the transition probability defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) is our model for calculating the total j/@xmath0 hadronic cross sections .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we plot the total j/@xmath0 cross sections using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsec ] ) in comparison with the data in hadronic collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> following the same fitting approach used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we fix all parameters in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) and list them in table  [ table1 ] , in which @xmath42 is defined as an overall normalization factor . to obtain the theory curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we used cteq4l parton distributions @xcite , and noticed that emc effect gives a very small modification to the total cross sections because of the integration of @xmath41 and @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we set @xmath43  gev and @xmath44  gev . </S>",
    "<S> choosing different values for the @xmath45 and @xmath17 changes the fitting parameters in table  [ table1 ] slightly . </S>",
    "<S> but , it does not change the quality of the comparison in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> all three parameterizations in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) provide a good fit to the total j/@xmath0 cross sections from proton - nucleon collisions at fixed target energies .    in nucleus - nucleus collisions , </S>",
    "<S> the produced @xmath1 pairs are likely to interact with the nuclear medium before they exit . </S>",
    "<S> observed anomalous nuclear enhancement of the momentum imbalance in dijet production tells us that a colored parton ( quark or gluon ) experiences multiple scatterings when it passes through the nuclear medium , and the square of the relative transverse momentum between two - jets increases in proportion to the size of the nucleus @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if we let the @xmath3 and @xmath4 be the parent - quarks of two jets , the @xmath11 becomes the square of the relative momentum between the two jets in their c.m . </S>",
    "<S> frame . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as the @xmath3 and @xmath4 pass through nuclear matter , just like a di - jet system , the square of the relative momentum @xmath11 increases . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , some of the @xmath1 pairs might gain enough relative momentum square @xmath11 to be pushed over the threshold to become open charm mesons , and consequently , the cross sections for j/@xmath0 production are reduced in comparison with nucleon - nucleon collisions .    if the formation length for the j/@xmath0 meson , which depends on the momenta of the @xmath1 pairs produced in the hard collision , is longer than the size of the nuclear medium , it is reasonable to assume that the transition probability @xmath46 , defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) , can be factorized from the multiple scattering . then , </S>",
    "<S> as far as the total cross section is concerned , the net effect of the multiple scattering of the @xmath1 pairs can be represented by a shift of @xmath11 in the transition probability , @xmath47 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q2shift ] ) , @xmath48 is the effective length of nuclear medium for the @xmath1 pair to pass through in the collisions of two nuclei of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and it depends on the details of the nuclear density distributions @xcite . in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q2shift ] ) , the @xmath49 represents the square of the relative momentum received by the @xmath1 pairs per unit length of the nuclear medium . </S>",
    "<S> the value of the @xmath49 can be estimated from the observed nuclear enhancement in the momentum imbalance of two - jets in hadron - nucleus collisions @xcite . using the data from pion - nucleus collisions </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we estimate that @xmath50  gev@xmath51 per unit length of nuclear medium @xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , we plot the predictions of j/@xmath0 total cross sections in proton - nucleon , proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions . the data in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] are from ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , in which all data were rescaled to @xmath52  gev . </S>",
    "<S> the effective length @xmath48 were chosen to be the same as those used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three theory curves correspond to three parameterizations defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the values of the parameter @xmath49 for different parameterizations are listed in table  [ table1 ] , which are consistent with our earlier estimates from the momentum imbalance of a di - jet system . as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] , we used the cteq4l parton distributions and set @xmath43  gev and @xmath44  gev for plotting fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . choosing different values for the @xmath45 and @xmath17 </S>",
    "<S> changes the values of @xmath49 slightly , but , it does not change the features of figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> the three parameterizations of the transition probability in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ model ] ) represent the different j/@xmath0 production mechanisms , and naturally , they predict different behavior of j/@xmath0 suppression in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , understanding the suppression can also help us to distinguish the production mechanism .    </S>",
    "<S> for the parameterization @xmath21 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ gauss ] ) , a shift of @xmath11 to @xmath53 in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q2shift ] ) for the j/@xmath0 suppression in nucleus - nucleus collisions gives following relation @xmath54 \\sigma_{nn\\rightarrow { \\rm j/}\\psi}(s ) . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{abgauss}\\ ] ] this relation is effectively the same as that predicted by the glauber theory , if we let the suppression factor in the simple glauber theory be @xmath55 $ ] , with @xmath56 being the nuclear density . with the parameters in table  [ table1 ] </S>",
    "<S> , we have the effective absorption cross section @xmath57  mb , which is the same as that obtained in ref .  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , our model interprets the @xmath58 in glauber theory is proportional to the energy absorbed by the colored @xmath1 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> as expected @xcite , like the glauber theory , the parameterization of @xmath21 does not generate enough suppression for heavy nucleus - nucleus collisions . as discussed earlier </S>",
    "<S> , the gaussian parameterization corresponds to assuming that the formation process does not have radiation , and is then proportional to the square of the j/@xmath0 wave - function . </S>",
    "<S> however , as we learned from the success of the color - octet model @xcite , the formation of j/@xmath0 should involve the expansion of the @xmath1 pairs and the radiation of soft gluons . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we should prefer a power - law parameterization than a gaussian parameterization , and consequently , we expect to have more suppression than that expected from the glauber approach .    </S>",
    "<S> since the @xmath20 is the same as the @xmath23 when @xmath59 , we expect a maximum suppression from the color - evaporation model , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the color - evaporation model assumes that all @xmath1 pairs with invariant mass less than the open charm threshold should have the same transition probability to become the j/@xmath0 meson . </S>",
    "<S> however , the phase space cutoff for the @xmath1 pairs to become the open charm in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsec ] ) appears classical . in quantum theory , the @xmath1 pairs with invariant mass less than the @xmath60 should have a small , but non - zero , probability to become open charm systems , and in general , the pairs just below the threshold should have a relatively larger probability for a transition to open charm than those far below the threshold . with these considerations , we believe that the power - law parameterization @xmath23 with @xmath61 represents the more accurate physics for the j/@xmath0 production .    </S>",
    "<S> our model of the j/@xmath0 production relies on the factorization between the production of the @xmath1 pairs and the formation of the j/@xmath0 mesons , and accurate calculation for the production of the @xmath1 pairs . for the total cross sections at fixed target energies </S>",
    "<S> , we believe that such factorization is justified , and the perturbative calculations are reliable . </S>",
    "<S> however , at collider energies , most j/@xmath0 events are measured at large transverse momentum , @xmath62 ; and the @xmath63 as well as the @xmath62 are much larger than the invariant mass of the @xmath1 pairs , @xmath64 , in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsec ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the perturbative calculations of @xmath30 and @xmath65 for the production of the @xmath1 pairs become very nontrivial due to the large logarithms @xmath66 and @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> a resummation of such large logarithms to all order in @xmath31 is necessary in order to have a reliable prediction . </S>",
    "<S> we defer our detailed discussions on j/@xmath0 production and suppression at the collider energies to another publication .    </S>",
    "<S> our predictions of the j/@xmath0 suppression , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] , depend on an additional assumption : the separation of the multiple scattering of the @xmath1 pairs and the formation of the j/@xmath0 mesons . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that this additional assumption can only be justified when the j/@xmath0 formation length is larger than the effective medium length @xmath48 in our eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ q2shift ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> once the j/@xmath0 meson is formed , the multiple scattering with nuclear medium should be reduced due to the color singlet nature of the meson , and then , the glauber formalism for the suppression should be more relevant . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> if there is no qcd phase transition to the quark - gluon plasma , we expect the following features for the j/@xmath0 suppression in nucleus - nucleus collisions . as the size of colliding nuclei increases , </S>",
    "<S> the j/@xmath0 suppression should follow the dotted curves in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ; and when the @xmath48 is compatible to the j/@xmath0 formation length , the suppression will become smaller than what is predicted by the dotted curve . finally , we conclude that our simple model for the total cross sections of j/@xmath0 production in nucleus - nucleus collisions , as defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ xsec ] ) , can explain the existing data in hadron - hadron , hadron - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions . </S>",
    "<S> although our model is different in many aspects from what have been discussed in the literature , we believe that it has the key physical mechanisms for the j/@xmath0 production and suppression . detailed comparison between our work and others in the literature are given in ref .  </S>",
