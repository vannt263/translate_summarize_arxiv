    "the far - infrared ( fir ) spectroscopy of laterally confined superlattices in the two dimensional electron gas ( 2deg ) made of holes surrounded by electrons , called antidots , has uncovered@xcite a very peculiar behavior of the collective spectrum of these systems .",
    "it has been found@xcite that it consists of a high frequency branch which starts either with a negative magnetic field @xmath1 dispersion in the case of high electronic surface density @xmath2 , or with a rather flat @xmath0 dispersion at low @xmath2 , that eventually converges to the cyclotron energy at high @xmath0 s , plus a low frequency branch which at high @xmath0 s corresponds to the usual edge magnetoplasmon , but that approaches the cyclotron frequency for small magnetic fields .",
    "anticrossing of the modes appears as @xmath0 increases .",
    "it is worth to recall that the mentioned behavior of the high frequency branch is also a feature of the fir spectrum of quantum rings@xcite .",
    "a study employing circularly polarized radiation@xcite has shown that both edge and bulk magnetoplasmons in antidots exhibit the same circular polarization , in contradistinction with what is found in quantum dots@xcite .",
    "interestingly , a very recent experiment@xcite has detected weak bulk modes anticyclotron - like polarized , whose existence had been predicted some time ago@xcite .",
    "another difference with dots appeared after a careful analysis of the edge magnetoplasmon@xcite : the frequency of this mode shows a conspicuous oscillation with @xmath0 that has maxima at fully occupied landau levels ( even filling factors @xmath3 ) in the case of dots , and at half - filled landau levels ( odd @xmath3 s ) in the case of antidots .",
    "several theoretical descriptions of fir modes in antidots have been given in the past .",
    "some are based on hydrodynamical@xcite or classical electrodynamics @xcite models , which either do not take into account the periodicity of the antidot array@xcite , or which take it into account either in a circularly symmetric wigner - seitz approximation@xcite , or incorporate the parameters of the experimental short - period antidot lattices without further approximations@xcite .    despite",
    "that all these models have somehow succesfully reproduced the fir absorption in antidots , the interest in achieving a more microscopic description of the ground state ( gs ) and fir response still remains .",
    "quantum mechanical ( hartree ) models have been set up which take into account the periodicity of the lattice using confining potentials of different complexity@xcite .",
    "the difficulties inherent to the handling of many single particle ( sp ) wave functions and realistic confining potentials which reflect the actual antidot lattice have hampered these microscopic methods to achieve a quantitative description of the fir absorption in antidots , although some features of the process are qualitatively described@xcite .",
    "recently , we have applied a local spin - density functional ( lsdft ) method to calculate the structure of isolate antidots at @xmath4 , together with a sum rule approach to describe their fir spectrum@xcite .",
    "our aim here is to extend these calculations to the case of finite magnetic fields and to present an account of the gs and dipole response of an antidot within the frame of lsdft and its time - dependent generalization ( tdlsdft ) .",
    "we recall that these formalisms incorporate the spin degree of freedom and allow to selfconsistently include exchange and correlation effects in the study of the gs and the response of the system , whose importance in the description of 2d electronic structures is nowadays well established .    rather than isolated antidots , the systems described in this work should be considered as representing long - period antidot lattices . although no much differences are expected to appear between the ground state structure of an isolated antidot and that of an antidot in a long - period array , apart from the obvious changes at the border of the unit cell , bulk magnetoplasmons are qualitatively different in both cases@xcite .",
    "we have modeled an antidot of radius @xmath5 in a 2deg of surface density @xmath2 by a positive jellium background of density @xmath6 .",
    "the gs of the antidot is obtained solving the kohn - sham ( ks ) equations .",
    "the problem is simplified by the imposed circular symmetry , which allows one to write the single particle ( sp ) wave functions as @xmath7 with @xmath8 , being @xmath9 the sp orbital angular momentum .",
    "we have used effective atomic units defined by @xmath101 , where @xmath11 is the dielectric constant , and @xmath12 the electron effective mass . in units of the bare electron mass",
    "@xmath13 one has @xmath14 . in this system of units ,",
    "the length unit is the effective bohr radius @xmath15 , and the energy unit is the effective hartree @xmath16 . in the numerical applications we have always considered",
    "gaas , for which we have taken @xmath11 = 12.4 , @xmath17 = 0.067 , and @xmath180.44 .",

    "@xmath32 has been built from the 2deg calculations of tanatar and ceperley@xcite at zero and full spin polarization , using the von barth and hedin@xcite interpolation formula adapted to 2d .",
    "the jellium potential @xmath35 is analytical@xcite :    @xmath36 \\,{\\bf k}(r / r )   &      r > r   \\,\\ , ,                  \\end{array } \\right .",

    "the ks differential equations have been solved without expanding the sp wave functions in a necessarily truncated basis of landau orbitals .",
    "our iterative method works for weak and strong @xmath0 fields as well , for which the effective potential is very different .",
    "it has the advantage of avoiding to study how the results depend on the size of the basis . as in ref .",
    ", we have worked at a small but finite temperature ( 0.1 k ) .",
    "physically acceptable solutions have to be regular at @xmath39 , and have to be bound due to the @xmath40 term in the ks equation .",
    "far from @xmath5 they behave as@xcite    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the magnetic length and @xmath43 is a generalized laguerre polynomial@xcite .",
    "once the ks ground state has been obtained , we determine the dipole longitudinal response employing linear - response theory@xcite .",
    "we sketch here how the method is applied .    for independent electrons in the ks mean field ,",
    "the variation @xmath44 induced in the spin density @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) by an external field @xmath47 , whose non - temporal dependence we denote as @xmath48 , can be written as @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the ks spin density correlation function . in this limit , the frequency @xmath51 corresponds to the harmonic time - dependence of the external field @xmath47 and of the induced @xmath52 .",
    "( [ eq4 ] ) is a 2@xmath532 matrix equation in the two - component pauli space . in longitudinal response theory ,",
    "@xmath47 is diagonal in this space , and its diagonal components are written as a vector @xmath54 .",
    "we consider external dipole ( @xmath55 = 1 ) fields of the kind @xmath56 which cause , respectively , charge and spin density modes of dipole type . to distinguish the induced densities in each excitation channel , we label them with an additional superscript as @xmath57 or @xmath58 .",
    "the tdlsdft induced densities are obtained solving the integral equations @xmath59 where either @xmath60 or @xmath61 , and the kernel @xmath62 is the electron - hole interaction .",
    "equations ( [ eq6 ] ) have been solved as a generalized matrix equation in coordinate space .",
    "considering angular decompositions of @xmath63 and @xmath64 of the kind @xmath65 , it is enough to solve them for @xmath66 because only this term couples to the external dipole field .",
    "when a magnetic field is perpendicularly applied to the antidot , the @xmath67 modes are not degenerate and two excitation branches may appear , each having _ in principle _ a different circular polarization , i.e. , carrying an orbital angular momentum @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is that of the gs . in contradistinction with the quantum dot ( qd ) case , we will see that this is not so for antidots , for which the more intense peaks in both branches have the same polarization .",
    "the induced charge or magnetization densities corresponding to density and spin responses are given by @xmath70 and @xmath71 . > from them , the dynamical polarizabilities in the density and spin channels are respectively given by @xmath72 in this expression @xmath73 has to be understood as the charge density induced by a spin - independent operator , and @xmath74 as the spin density magnetization induced by a spin - dependent operator .",
    "within longitudinal response theory , cross - channel induced densities such as @xmath75 or @xmath76 may also appear@xcite .",
    "the above expressions hold for each @xmath67 circular polarization of the @xmath47 operators defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) . taking into account both possibilities ,",
    "we define @xmath77 , whose imaginary part is proportional to the strength function @xmath78/\\pi$ ] .",
    "the peaks appearing in the strength functions are dipole charge density ( cde ) or spin density excitations ( sde ) caused by the external field .",
    "analogously , the peaks appearing in the strength function which results from using in eq .",
    "( [ eq7 ] ) the ks induced densities @xmath79 instead of the correlated ones @xmath80 , correspond to dipole single particle excitations ( spe ) .",
    "we have used for the @xmath81 function entering eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) two different choices .",
    "one is the standard dipole operator @xmath82 , and the other one is @xmath83 . as indicated in ref .",
    ", the latter choice is inspired in the small - argument expansion of the irregular bessel function @xmath84 .",
    "the relevance of this operator in the present context is that it mostly causes edge excitations .",
    "this will be futher discussed in the next section .",
    "the situation is analogous to that faced in the description of surface modes of 3d cavities in metals , see ref . for a thorough discussion",
    "as a case of study we have considered an antidot of @xmath85 @xmath86 and @xmath87 @xmath88 .",
    "it roughly corresponds to one of the systems studied by zhao et al @xcite having @xmath89 @xmath90 and the same area .",
    "we recall that the antidot arrays studied in this reference have a very short period , whereas we have taken for @xmath37 defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) a mean value of 30 @xmath88 , larger for large @xmath3 s , and smaller for small @xmath3 s .",
    "we have employed @xmath0 values yielding integer filling factors @xmath91 in the range @xmath92 which corresponds to @xmath93 t.    figure [ fig1 ] shows the particle @xmath33 and spin magnetization densities @xmath94 as a function of @xmath38 for @xmath95 to 6 .",
    "away from @xmath5 , the electron density approaches @xmath2 , and either @xmath94 is zero if @xmath3 is even , or the local spin polarization @xmath96 equals @xmath97 .",
    "the number of sp orbitals needed to numerically achieve this limit increases with @xmath3 , making it rather involved to obtain high-@xmath3 ground states .",
    "for instance , some 2500 occupied sp levels have been used to model the @xmath98 gs .    figure [ fig2 ] shows the sp energies @xmath99 as a function of @xmath100 for the same configurations as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . in the bulk , @xmath99 are arranged into landau bands characterized by the index @xmath101 and the value of @xmath102 .",
    "the filling factor represents the number of occupied landau bands , each of them labeled as @xmath103 .",
    "it is worth noticing that since we have taken @xmath0 in the positive @xmath104 direction and the sp orbital angular momentum is written as @xmath9 , most occupied sp levels have @xmath105 , and that for a given @xmath106 the @xmath107 band lies below the @xmath108 one .",
    "these bands are almost degenerate when @xmath3 is even because of the smallness of the zeeman energy and because @xmath109 in the gs .",
    "when @xmath3 is odd , the spin dependence of the exchange - correlation energy @xmath110 is responsible of the large gap between the @xmath111 bands@xcite . defining the @xmath106-th landau level as the set of @xmath107 and @xmath108 bands with @xmath112 , 1 , 2 , ... , we see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] that even @xmath3 values correspond to completely filled landau levels configurations , and odd @xmath3 values to configurations in which one landau level is half - filled .",
    "if @xmath106 is not too small , the @xmath106-th level is made of sp states having @xmath113 .",
    "as in qd s , this rule is violated by a few sp states per landau level at most , see for instance fig . 1 of ref . , and the @xmath114 panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] .",
    "the dipole fir response has been obtained as outlined in sect .",
    "ii . besides evaluating the occupied landau levels , two more empty levels have been calculated , which allows an accurate description of modes up to @xmath115 .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the charge , spin , and single electron strength functions corresponding to the dipole operator .",
    "all peaks displayed in this figure are of cyclotron - like type , i.e. , they are excited by the @xmath116 component of the @xmath47 operators in eq .",
    "this makes possible the transfering of strength among them , an effect that has been experimentally observed@xcite .",
    "we remark in passing that the fact that all these peaks originate from the same excitation operator makes the sum rule approach @xcite unsuitable to describe their excitation energies .",
    "our sign convention implies that at @xmath117 the gs has a _ negative _ total orbital angular momentum @xmath69 .",
    "thus , these excitations _ decrease _ in one unit the absolute value of @xmath69 ; whenever needed , we shall label cyclotron - like modes with a @xmath118 sign .",
    "bulk magnetoplasmons in qd s also bear this character , whereas edge magnetoplasmons do not ( see for instance refs . ) .",
    "indeed , edge magnetoplasmons in qd s are excited by the @xmath119 component of the dipole field and correspond to excitations which _ increase _ in one unit the absolute value of @xmath69 . whenever needed",
    ", we shall label the anticyclotron - like modes with a @xmath120 sign .",
    "the cyclotron - like character of edge magnetoplasmons in antidots has its microscopic origin in the upwards bending of the landau levels for _ small _ @xmath100 values , whereas the anticyclotron - like character of the edge magnetoplasmons in dots comes from the upwards bending of the landau levels for _ large _ @xmath100 values .",
    "as in quantum dots , sde s are weakly redshifted with respect to spe s because of the attractive character of the rather small exchange - correlation vertex corrections , whereas cde s are strongly blueshifted because of the repulsive character of the intense direct coulomb interaction . in contradistinction with the qd case@xcite , no clear signature of a collective longitudinal spin edge magnetoplasmon appears at small @xmath0 values :",
    "the edge spin mode is rather fragmented and weak .",
    "we recall that at full magnetizacion _ longitudinal _ spin and density responses coincide@xcite and only spin modes of transverse type , not studied here , can be excited@xcite",
    ".    another interesting feature of longitudinal response theory is that spin and charge density modes are generally coupled if the gs has a large spin magnetization , as it happens for instance at @xmath121 .",
    "this means that spin dependent probes may excite charge density modes .",
    "conversely , spin independent probes may excite spin density modes .",
    "this coupling has been experimentally detected in qd s using raman spectroscopy@xcite , and has been theoretically addressed@xcite within tdlsdft .",
    "for an antidot the effect is more marked , since @xmath122 reaches @xmath97 instead of a smaller effective value as it happens in qd .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare antidot with dot results . for this sake",
    ", we show in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the dipole charge density response of a qd made of @xmath123 electrons confined by the potential created by a jellium disk of radius @xmath124 . outside the edge region",
    ", this system has a surface density of @xmath125 , similar to our case - of study antidot , and it has been thoroughly studied in ref . . for this dot",
    "the @xmath92 range corresponds to @xmath126 t.    the energies of the more intense cde s of the antidot and of the @xmath123 qd have been drawn as a function of @xmath0 in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] , respectively ( a more complete version of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] can be found in ref . ) .",
    "also drawn are the cyclotron frequency @xmath127 , and @xmath115 and @xmath128 as well .",
    "these figures show that the interaction of the bulk magnetoplasmon with the harmonics of the cyclotron resonance @xmath129 , resembling the berstein modes@xcite , which causes the splitting of the magnetoplasmon near @xmath115 and @xmath128 , is well reproduced by the calculations . alongside the groups of peaks corresponding to cde",
    "we have indicated the change in radial quantum number @xmath130 of the sp wave functions involved in the transition .",
    "this change @xmath131 is unambiguosly identified in tdlsdft calculations introducing energy cutoffs in the electron - hole energy denominators @xmath132 entering the definition of the free correlation function@xcite @xmath50 : limiting the electron - hole pairs to those having @xmath133 , only @xmath134 peaks apear in the response , whereas limiting them to those with @xmath135 , no @xmath136 peaks appear .",
    "these cyclotron - like @xmath136 peaks have been experimentally detected@xcite .",
    "the correlations introduced by tdlsdft have a dramatic effect on the fir response of the system which might not always be properly recognized .",
    "not only they appreciably shift the cde energies with respect to the spe s but also affect their intensity , causing that peaks having a sizeable strength in the spe response are nearly washed out , whereas others hardly perceived in the spe response adquire a large strength . to illustrate it we show in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] the single particle and charge density strength functions for @xmath137 in a logarithmic scale .",
    "it can be noticed that in the spe strength the @xmath115 peak , which has an intensity six orders of magnitude smaller than the @xmath127 peak and can not be seen at the scale of fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , emerges as a very collective peak in the cde strength , of intensity similar to that of the bulk @xmath138 peak .",
    "similarly , the weak edge spe s loose their dimy intensity , transferring it to the very collective @xmath139 edge cde .",
    "of course , in actual tdlsdft calculations all these modes are reciprocally influenced , but the gross effect is as described .",
    "tdlsdft does reproduce the oscillation of the edge magnetoplasmon energy as a function of filling factor@xcite .",
    "figure [ fig9 ] shows the edge magnetoplasmon energy as a function of @xmath3 for the antidot and the @xmath123 dot .",
    "the oscillations and the out - of - phase effect@xcite are tiny effects better seen plotting the second differences of the edge magnetoplasmon energy : @xmath140 the energy oscillations are clearly seen in the fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] insert , as well as the experimental finding that maxima in the edge magnetoplasmon energies correspond to half - filled landau levels in antidots , and to filled landau levels in dots .",
    "> from figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig6 ] we conclude that for an isolate antidot , tdlsdft is unable to produce the anticrossing of the edge and the cyclotron modes at small @xmath0 values which is observed in short - period antidot arrays . yet , the behavior of the antidot and dot @xmath139 edge branch near the crossing is quite distinct , manifesting a different curvature .",
    "the low-@xmath0 behavior of the edge brach experimentally found in short - period antidot arrays is likely influenced by neighboring antidots .",
    "notice that @xmath141 at @xmath142 , which is roughly half the effective surface width of the antidot lattice period of ref . .",
    "figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig6 ] also show that the tdlsdft antidot response is very fragmented at low @xmath0 .",
    "this renders tricky to distinguish bulk from edge charge modes .",
    "notice that at @xmath143 the high energy peak in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] is a @xmath144 mode , whereas the low energy peak is a mixture of @xmath139 and @xmath138 peaks .",
    "the situation worsens increasing @xmath3 , which is beyond our capabilities .",
    "for instance , to have results at @xmath145 t one would need to carry out calculations for @xmath146 .",
    "a possible way to partially disentangle these modes is to study the charge density response to the @xmath83 operator .",
    "its @xmath38 dependence makes this very ineffective in exciting cyclotron - like modes while it is well suited to describe edge oscillations .",
    "this can be seeing in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , where we have plotted the cde s caused by @xmath38 and @xmath147 for @xmath143 to 7 . in the bottom panel , the intensity of the @xmath147 peaks has been multiply by a factor of 50,000 to allow for a sensible comparison with the @xmath38 peaks .",
    "it can then be seen in that panel that both operators excite the same @xmath148 peaks , but with much different intensity , and that indeed , the low energy peak clearly visible in the response is an edge peak .",
    "finally , we have plotted in the top panel of that figure the cde caused by the @xmath119 component of the @xmath47 operators in eq .",
    "these are anticyclotron - like excitations of very weak intensity : to have them at the same scale as in the bottom panel , one should divide the scale of the @xmath38 modes by a factor of 40 , and the scale of the @xmath147 modes by a factor of 4 , i.e. , the @xmath147 operator excites the cyclotron - like and anticyclotron - like main peaks with roughly equal intensity . in agreement with the experiment",
    "( see especially fig . 1 of ref .",
    ") , it can be seen on the one hand that their intensity quickly decrease as @xmath0 increases , and on the other hand that their energies are very similar to these of the cyclotron - like modes .",
    "this makes these modes experimentaly accessible only using circular polarized radiation .",

    "<S> we have investigated the far - infrared dipole modes of a quantum antidot submitted to a perpendicularly applied magnetic field @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the antidot is described within local spin - density functional theory , and the spectrum within time - dependent local spin - density functional theory . </S>",
    "<S> the results are compared with those corresponding to a quantum dot of similar electronic surface density . </S>",
    "<S> the method is able to reproduce two of the more salient experimental features , namely that main bulk and edge modes have the same circular polarization , and that the negative @xmath0 dispersion edge branch oscillates , having minima at the @xmath0 values corresponding to fully occupied landau levels . </S>",
    "<S> it fails , however , to yield the unique feature of short - period antidot lattices that the energy of the edge magnetoplasmon approaches the cyclotron frequency for small @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of anticyclotron polarized bulk modes is discussed , and a detailed account of the dipole spin mode is presented . </S>"
