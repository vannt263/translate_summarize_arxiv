    "fission induced by nucleons at intermediate energies , _ i. e. _ from pion production threshold ( @xmath2 150 mev ) to a few gev , is important from both basic and applied viewpoints .",
    "even if fission is explained as a decay process of residual nuclei formed at the end of the fast nucleon cascade in the spallation reaction , many details are not yet clarified and deserve further experimental and theoretical work .",
    "important applications of intermediate energy fission are energy production with accelerator driven systems @xcite , radioactive waste transmutation@xcite and radiation shield design for accelerators : these applications require proton and neutron fission cross sections to be determined with high accuracy in a wide energy range .    many experimental data have accumulated in the last sixty years : ref.@xcite gives a detailed review of the @xmath0 and @xmath1 measurements up to the beginning of the present century and ref.@xcite proposes a parametrization of @xmath0 cross sections based on the same experimental systematics .    among the recent @xmath0 experiments a prominent role is played by kotov et al.@xcite , who give the cross sections tabulated in steps of 100 mev in the range from 200 mev to 1 gev for several actinides very important for applications , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 , and for two pre - actinides , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , forming the eutectic system acting as a spallation target and as a coolant in an accelerator driven system .    a similar role for @xmath1 experiments",
    "is currently being played by the n_tof facility@xcite at cern , which can measure fission cross sections from thermal energies up to about 1 gev , with a pulsed neutron beam produced by 20 gev / c protons from the ps accelerator impinging on a lead spallation target . since measuring an absolute cross section",
    "requires simultaneous determination of fission events and neutron flux , which is a very difficult task , the measurements performed up to the present time are relative to @xmath9 and absolute cross sections have been obtained by normalizing the experimental ratios to an evaluated @xmath9 cross section , commonly taken from the endf / b - vii.1 library@xcite up to @xmath10 = 30 mev and from the jendl / he-2007 library@xcite from 30 mev to 1 gev .",
    "@xmath1 cross sections up to 1 gev have already been published for @xmath11 and @xmath5@xcite , as well as for @xmath7 and @xmath8@xcite .",
    "preliminary data have been obtained for @xmath3 and @xmath12 .",
    "it is experimentally known@xcite that at the lower extremum of the intermediate energy range ( @xmath2 100 - 150 mev ) the @xmath1 cross section is systematically lower than the @xmath0 cross section for a given target nucleus , the effect being larger for pre - actinides than for actinides , but the difference tends to decrease with increasing incident energy , so that at 1 gev the behaviour of protons and neutrons is expected to be quite similar and the corresponding fission cross sections of the same order .",
    "main purpose of the present work is to check whether available @xmath0 and @xmath1 data for a given target nucleus can be reproduced with satisfactory accuracy using the same set of model parameters , or , at least , with very close values ; in the affirmative , where only @xmath0 data exist in the energy range of interest , it is reasonable to use them to predict @xmath1 data for the same target nucleus , or viceversa .",
    "our work is similar in spirit to ref.@xcite , where use was made of the los alamos codes cem2k+gem2 ( cascade - exciton model plus generalized evaporation model ) and laqgsm+gem2 ( quark - gluon string model plus generalized evaporation model ) in order to reproduce @xmath0 cross sections for pre - actinides and actinides , from @xmath13 to @xmath6 , taken mainly from prokofiev s systematics@xcite , extending the calculations to a large energy range , from tens of mev to 5 gev . with cem2k+gem2 , good fits were obtained by adjusting only two parameters , the ratio , @xmath14 , of level density parameters in the fission and evaporation channels for fissioning nuclei with atomic number @xmath15 and a constant , @xmath16 , in a semi - empirical parametrization of the ratio , @xmath17 , of neutron and fission width for @xmath18 .",
    "using the same parameters , @xmath1 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 cross sections were calculated for the same nuclei and reasonable agreement with experimental data was obtained in several cases . with laqgsm+gem2 , the set of parameters fitted from@xmath0 reactions made it possible to reproduce fission fragment production and spallation , fragmentation and evaporation products in heavy - ion induced reactions measured at gsi - darmstadt in inverse kinematics@xcite . finally , the latest versions of the above mentioned codes , introduced as event generators in los alamos transport codes , such as mcnp6 , where carefully tested not only in the calculations of fission - fragment yields and of particles emitted from them , as is usually done with transport codes , but also in the calculations of fission cross sections@xcite .",
    "with the models used in the present work , fission induced by nucleons in the energy range of interest can be seen as a two - stage process : a fast cascade stage , initiated by the high energy projectile , and representable as a succession of two - body collisions , with emission of fast nucleons , light clusters , pions , etc , leaving an excited remnant , and the slow decay stage , where the remnant decays by evaporation , fission , or other mechanisms . in our system of codes , the intranuclear cascade is described by a recent c++ version of the lige intranuclear cascade model , incl++@xcite , the evaporation - fission model by a c++ version of gemini , gemini++@xcite@xcite , or a fortran version of abla07@xcite .",
    "it is to be pointed out , however , that the description of intermediate energy fission as a two- stage process is not a general rule in commonly used models and codes : many of them treat fission as a three - stage process , with an intermediate pre - equilibrium stage between fast cascade and evaporation - fission .",
    "such an intermediate stage was originally suggested at jinr dubna and resulted in the original version of the cascade - exciton model@xcite , already mentioned in the introduction , which finally evolved in the version@xcite currently used in the los alamos transport codes mcnpx , mcnp6 and mars15 .",
    "the three - stage description is present in the event generators of many other well - known transport codes of general use .",
    "coming back to the codes used in the present work , incl++@xcite is a time - like intranuclear cascade model . at the beginning of the cascade stage ,",
    "the incident nucleon is located with its own impact parameter on the surface of a working sphere , centered on the target nucleus with a radius @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the radius and the diffuseness of the target nucleus , respectively .",
    "particles move along straight - line trajectories between collisions in the working sphere and are divided into participants and spectators in the usual sense .",
    "participants that leave the working sphere are considered as ejectiles . inside the working sphere , nucleons feel a potential that depends on energy and isospin .",
    "the depth of the potential well decreases linearly with increasing energy , from ordinary values at the fermi level to zero at about 200 mev .",
    "the isospin dependence is such that neutron and proton fermi levels have the same energy .",
    "collisions are , of course , governed by pauli blocking , treated in a different way in the first and in the subsequent collisions .",
    "the nucleons involved in the first collision are subject to a strict blocking : after the collision , both of them should lie outside the fermi sphere . in subsequent collisions ,",
    "the blocking is applied stochastically , with a probability given by the product of final - state blocking factors .",
    "a careful definition of the latter allows one to account for surface effects and for the depletion of the fermi sphere during the evolution of the cascade .",
    "an important novelty of recent versions of the code is the introduction of a coalescence model based on phase space , which permits the emission of light clusters , with mass @xmath24 , during the cascade stage , in keeping with experimental evidence .",
    "pions are produced in inelastic nucleon - nucleon collisions through the excitation and subsequent decay of @xmath25 resonances , which sets an upper limit of the order of 3 gev to the incident nucleon energy for the mechanism of pion production to be valid .",
    "the lower energy limit is given by the requirement that the de broglie wave length of relative motion be much smaller than the range of nuclear forces , which in turn is smaller than the average distance of neighbouring nucleons and is commonly set to 200 mev , although the model performs reasonably well even at lower energies , as shown in fission calculations of the following section .    an important characteristic of the model is the self - consistent determination of the stopping time of the cascade , which can be simply parametrized as @xmath26 fm / c , with @xmath27 the mass of the target nucleus . at @xmath28",
    "many physical quantities , such as the excitation energy of the target nucleus and the average kinetic energy of the ejectiles , switch from a fast time evolution , dominated by intranuclear cascade , to a much slower evolution , which is taken as a signature of equilibration . thanks to this choice of the stopping time , it is not necessary to introduce a pre - equilibrium model describing the intermediate stage between the fast cascade and the evaporation - fission decay .",
    "the effect of an explicit pre - equilibrium stage in the incl model on nucleon - induced reactions above 200 mev was tested in ref.@xcite and found not really necessary .",
    "the effect might be more significant in the energy range from 100 to 200 mev , with particular reference to energy spectra and angular distributions of emitted particles , rather than the fission cross sections considered in the present work .",
    "however , no clear evidence in this sense emerged from the latest iaea benchmark of spallation models@xcite , whose conclusions are presented in ref.@xcite .",
    "gemini++@xcite@xcite is a statistical - model code which follows the decay of a compound nucleus by a series of sequential binary decays until such decays are forbidden by energy conservation or become improbable because of gamma - ray competition . differently from most statistical - model codes , light - particle evaporation is described by the hauser - feshbach formalism , which strictly conserves angular momentum , at the price of higher computational time with respect to the more common weisskopf - ewing formalism .",

    "the effective level density parameter @xmath42 is taken of the form@xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 = 7.3 mev , @xmath45 = 12 mev and @xmath46 , with @xmath47 the mass number .    the decay width for symmetric fission , dominant at high excitation energy ,",
    "is given by the well - known bohr - wheeler formula , while the decay width for asymmetric fission is derived from moretto s formalism@xcite @xcite , based on the concept of conditional fission barrier , _ i. e. _ a saddle point configuration with fixed asymmetry of mass and charge of the prefragments .",
    "liquid drop barriers are calculated by means of sierk s finite - range model@xcite , with shell and pairing corrections taken from ref.@xcite .",
    "an important adjustable parameter in the code is the ratio of the effective level density parameter at the saddle point , @xmath48 , to the same quantity at ground - state deformation , @xmath49 , with a default value of 1.036@xcite .",
    "fission transients are not considered , although it has been shown@xcite that the model can accommodate a short fission delay .",
    "abla07@xcite is a statistical code describing the de - excitation of a nucleus in thermal equilibrium by particle evaporation , fission , or , above a prescribed excitation energy per nucleon , multifragmentation .",
    "particle evaporation is treated in an extended weisskopf - ewing formalism , where a distribution of orbital angular momenta in the emission of nucleons and clusters is evaluated in semiclassical approximation , based on phase space arguments .",
    "the model also allows generalized evaporation of excited clusters , which plays a role analogous to asymmetric fission in gemini++ .",
    "an essential ingredient of the decay formalism is the nuclear level density as a function of excitation energy and angular momentum , described by a constant temperature formula at low energy and by a bethe - type formula ( [ bethe ] ) at high energy .",
    "the asymptotic level density parameter , @xmath50 ( see formula ( [ a_ig ] ) ) , is energy - independent and given , in mev@xmath51 , by the original prescription of ref.@xcite @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the ratio of the surface of the deformed nucleus to that of a spherical nucleus with the same mass number @xmath47 , as in the finite - range liquid drop model@xcite .",
    "the level density contains a collective enhancement factor , due to nuclear rotations and vibrations , depending on excitation energy@xcite .",
    "the approach to fission contains elements of dynamics : the time evolution of the fission degree of freedom is treated as a diffusion process , determined by the interaction of collective degrees of freedom with a heat bath formed by the individual nucleons and described by a fokker - planck equation whose solution leads to a time - dependent fission width , @xmath54 .",
    "an analytical approximation to such a solution and , consequently , to the time dependence of the fission width makes the problem computationally tractable . at low excitation energy ,",
    "the code uses the standard model of a two - humped fission barrier , whose penetrability is computed in the approximation of full damping of the vibrational resonances in the intermediate well .",
    "like in the gemini++ code , liquid drop barriers are computed in the frame of the finite - range model@xcite and shell and pairing corrections are taken from ref . @xcite .",
    "as already stressed in the introduction , our main purpose is a simultaneous reproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections for the same target nuclei , possibly using the same , or , at least , rather close values of model parameters .",
    "in fact , it is expected that the isospin dependence of the fission cross section is already contained in the models we use .    in order to better understand how fission keeps memory of projectile isospin ,",
    "it is worth recalling that the fission cross section increases with increasing fissility parameter , @xmath55 , where @xmath56 and @xmath47 are charge and mass of the fissioning nucleus . in the case of a proton induced reaction ,",
    "the highest fissility parameter is obtained when the incident proton is captured by the target nucleus and is proportional to @xmath57 , with @xmath58 and @xmath27 the charge and mass of the target nucleus , while in the case of capture of an incident neutron the fissility parameter is smaller , since it is proportional to @xmath59 .",
    "an analysis of charge and mass distributions of remnants undergoing fission at the end of the fast cascade stage , carried out in ref.@xcite with the cascade - exciton model code cem95@xcite for @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions up to a projectile energy @xmath60 = 200 mev showed the relevance of remnants with charge @xmath61 in enhancing the @xmath0 cross section with respect to the @xmath1 cross section , where remnants can not have charges larger than @xmath58 . by considering the fissility parameter dependence of the liquid drop barriers , the authors of ref.@xcite explained also why the difference of @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections is much larger in pre - actinides than in actinides .",
    "it is worth recalling that a cem95 analysis and interpretation of the differences between @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections for @xmath62 and @xmath8 in the energy range from 45 to 500 mev had already been published in ref.@xcite .",
    "the analysis of differences of @xmath0 and @xmath1 reactions was further enriched with new experimental data in the pre - actinide region by the authors of ref.@xcite , who derived also an approximate analytical dependence of the @xmath63 ratio on @xmath64 at given projectile energy , @xmath65 .",
    "for instance , at @xmath66 180 mev , they obtained @xmath67\\quad , \\label{sigma_ratio}\\ ] ] valid for both actinides and pre - actinides . with increasing projectile energy up to the gev region",
    ", it is expected that the differences in the behaviour of neutrons and protons become smaller , so that @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections tend to a common value .    in keeping with the philosophy of the authors of the incl++ code@xcite@xcite ,",
    "no parameters have been modified in the intranuclear cascade model , already optimized by reproducing a large amount of data related to the cascade stage , such as total reaction cross sections , double - differential spectra of emitted nucleons , pions and light clusters , while two basic fission model parameters have been taken as adjustable either in gemini++ or abla07 : the height of the liquid - drop fission barrier , @xmath68 , and the asymptotic level density parameter at the saddle point , @xmath48 , in abla07 , or the ratio of the level density parameter at the saddle point to that at the ground state deformation , @xmath69 , in gemini++ .",
    "both parameters affect significantly the calculation of fission cross sections in the whole energy range of interest to the present work , from 100 mev to 1 gev , although the change of the barrier height is more important at low incident energy and the change of the level density parameter at high energy . in principle",
    ", many sets of experimental data could be reproduced by modifying only one parameter , _ e.g. _",
    "@xmath48 , at the the cost of using rather different values of it in the neutron and proton channels , particularly for actinides , as we did in our preliminary work@xcite .    in the following sub - section results for absolute @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "cross sections are presented and discussed in comparison with experimental data , while a separate sub - section will be dedicated to @xmath1 cross sections relative to @xmath9 , with particular reference to the comparison with n_tof data .",
    "the rationale behind our work is to adjust fission model parameters on the @xmath0 cross sections of ref.@xcite for @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath6 and use similar parameter values in computing @xmath1 cross sections for the same targets . as alredy pointed out in our preliminary work@xcite",
    ", the gemini++ and abla07 models can produce fits of comparable accuracy for actinides , while in the lead - bismuth region abla07 appears to work better than gemini++ .",
    "therefore , we have decided to show the results of gemini++ calculations for actinides and those of abla07 calculations for lead and bismuth .",
    "the experiment of ref.@xcite , labelled as kotov 2006 in the figures , yields 9 cross section values in the energy range from 207 mev to 1 gev .",
    "we have evaluated the quality of our fits by means of a @xmath70 test , where the @xmath70 variable is defined as @xmath71 where the symbols are self - explanatory .",
    "since we try to reproduce 9 experimental values , @xmath72 , by adjusting 2 parameters , the relevant @xmath70 distribution , @xmath73 , should have @xmath74 = 9 - 2 degrees of freedom and the quality of fit is evaluated by means of the cumulative probability @xmath75      table [ tabi ] shows the values of the parameters adjusted on the experimental @xmath0 data of ref.@xcite for actinides in our incl++/gemini++ calculations , _",

    "therefore , knowledge of the @xmath0 cross section in this energy range yields less useful information on the @xmath1 cross section with respect to actinides .",

    "also the measurement of ref.@xcite is relative to @xmath81 , but we do not know the values adopted for normalization , so that we could consider only the absolute cross section .",
    "the disagreement with ref.@xcite above 500 mev is mainly due to the jendl / he-2007 cross section adopted in that reference for normalization .    summing up ,",
    "@xmath0 and @xmath1 cross sections have been reproduced with the same model parameters in the cases of @xmath93 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath62 ; the same level density parameters , but different corrections to the heights of fission barriers have been adopted for @xmath90 , @xmath3 and @xmath8 ; finally , slightly different level density parameters and barrier height corrections have been used for @xmath7 : this is a peculiar case , since the natural element consists of sizable abundances of @xmath62 , @xmath94 and @xmath95 . in principle , each isotope should have its own model parameters , but , for the sake of simplicity , we have chosen to treat @xmath7 as an effective nucleus .",
    "in the present work we have reproduced @xmath0 cross sections in the intermediate energy range for a number of actinides and pre - actinides relevant to nuclear energy applications by a two - parameter fit : an increase of the level density parameter at the saddle point with increasing fissility parameter is observed in specific isotopic chains , such as uranium nuclei in table i and lead nuclei in table ii , but the present data are not sufficient to determine a global trend in either region . therefore , the results of the present work can not be used for prediction of fission cross sections of isotopes for which neither @xmath0 or @xmath1 data exist in the intermediate energy range .",
    "the model parameters that reproduce @xmath0 cross sections have been used as a first guess in the calculation of @xmath1 cross sections , where the comparison with experiments is complicated by the fact that the large majority of data are relative to fission standards , such as @xmath93 in the actinide region and/or @xmath8 in the pre - actinide region , but even for the standards absolute cross section data are not available above 200 mev .",
    "@xmath1 cross sections are systematically lower than @xmath0 cross sections around 100 mev , but the differences are expected to reduce with increasing projectile energy , particularly for actinides , whose @xmath0 data exhibit a large plateau from 500 mev to 1 gev .",
    "this effect is clearly seen in our calculations .",
    "as far as @xmath1 cross sections are concerned , the only relative measurements extending up to 1 gev , due to the n_tof collaboration , are satisactorily reproduced by our calculations .",
    "the disagreement between corresponding absolute cross sections is almost entirely due to the normalization to the jendl / he-2007 evaluation of the @xmath9 reaction adopted in n_tof papers@xcite,@xcite .    a deeper comparison with evaluated data libraries such as jendl / he-2007 would require an extension of the energy range of our calculations : as already shown in the case of @xmath96 , whose calculations up to 3 gev look promising , the codes used in this work allow us to extend cross section calculations up to 3 gev , but moving the lower extremum down to 20 mev",
    "could only be done by resorting to fully quantum - mechanical models , since the very concept of intranuclear cascade model loses its applicability at low energies .",
    "a recent example of consistent calculations of @xmath0 and @xmath1 calculations in the energy range from 20 mev to 1 gev for a number of actinides is provided by ref.@xcite , where use is made of the mcfx system of codes , permitting a good reproduction of many experimental data at the cost of adjusting the heights of the fission barriers of remnants obtained from microscopic calculations .",
    "this has been done by us , too , at the very phenomenologic level permitted by the @xmath76 parameter of tables i - ii .",
    "an extension of our fission calculations to the energy range from 20 mev to 3 gev is planned for the nuclei already suggested as fission standards , @xmath93 and @xmath8 , with the specific scope of support to the analysis of @xmath1 cross sections measured at the n_tof facility@xcite at cern .",
