    "it erupts about every 90 minutes and projects hot water up to 56 m high@xcite .",
    "probably the first scientist to describe the principle of a geyser was robert bunsen in 1845 after the danish government sponsored him to study the eruption of mount hekla in iceland @xcite .",
    "he lowered a thermometer into geyser depths and discovered that they had at their base a reservoir of superheated water .",
    "he understood that when the water in the reservoir boils , the liquid in the vent is ejected upwards and produces an eruption of hot water and steam .",

    ", the dynamics of a geyser can be much more complex time series that the one of a toy geyser as revealed by _ in situ _ data collection in yellowstone usa @xcite or at el tatio in chile @xcite .",
    "such a complexity can be attributed to a high sensitivity of geysers dynamics towards water and steam inflow @xcite , barometric pressure , tidal forces , tectonic stresses @xcite or reservoirs interconnection @xcite . over the past decades ,",
    "crucial steps in the theoretical modelling of geyser eruptions have been achieved @xcite but an extensive description of the problem is still to uncover .    throughout this paper",

    "the temperature of the reservoir is @xmath31 whereas the overlying pressure is close to the atmospheric one and imposes an equilibrium temperature @xmath16 .",

    "the deviation of experimental data from the theoretical predictions at large heating power ( @xmath45 w / kg ) can be attributed to the omission of the energy injected by the heating plate in the energy balance of the model .",
    "indeed , the specific heating power @xmath5 delays the cooling of the water in the reservoir by vaporization .",
    "+      when an eruption has occurred and water has left the vent , the vaporization in the reservoir results from both the injected heat power @xmath46 and the heat flux @xmath47 coming from the water superheat .",

    "the aim of this section is to inspect under which conditions a toy geyser can lead to periodic eruptions .",
    "first , we inspect the physical origin of toy geyser eruptions , and second we consider the domain of existence of three non - periodic regimes : the fumarole regime , the hot springs regime and the boiling pool regime .",
    "first , we investigate the effect of the vent radius on the toy geyser .",
    "experimentally , we observed that if the vent radius is too large ( @xmath68 mm ) , the vapor bubbles produced by the boiling in the reservoir are able to rise without entraining the surrounding water and no eruptions occur .",
    "thus , the birth of a geyser eruption is caused by the transition from a dispersed flow regime to an annular flow regime in the vent .",
    "the regimes of a two - phase flow in a vertical pipe have been studied extensively by mishima _",

    "the vapor volumic fraction in the vent @xmath69 can be estimated by assuming that when the reservoir reaches its boiling temperature @xmath31 , all the specific heating power @xmath5 is used to vaporize water .",
    "the balance between the vapor departure through the vent and the vapor production in the reservoir yields    @xmath70    using the critical vapor volume fraction @xmath71 introduced in section [ sec : exch_mass ] , we predict the critical vent radius @xmath72 below which eruptions occur    @xmath73    for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath63 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , we get @xmath79 .",
    "the vent radius used in the experiments presented in section [ sec : experiments ] ( @xmath80 ) is smaller than @xmath72 which explains why periodic eruptions were observed . in order to verify the previous criteria",
    ", we built a model geyser with the same reservoir and the same height but a different vent radius @xmath81 and no eruptions have been observed , consistently with our approach .",
    "such a regime is called the hot spring regime because only tiny and hot vapor bubbles reach the pool .    beyond the case of a toy geyser , bubble clogging in a vertical constriction",
    "is a phenomenon observed in a large variety of situations such as volcanic eruptions @xcite , cold co@xmath82 geysers @xcite , mentos in diet coke @xcite and beer taping @xcite . in the particular case of volcanic eruptions , the elevation of the internal pressure in the volcano and thus the explosiveness of the eruption depend on possibility for gas to escape .",
    "depending on the volatile content of the magma , its viscosity and the configuration of the magmatic chamber , different types of eruption occur from hawaiian to plinian eruptions @xcite .      for large specific heating power @xmath5 , we observed a first eruption followed by a continuous vaporization of the water in the reservoir .",
    "in such a case , the liquid in the pool is unable to go down into the reservoir . because of permanent emission of vapor through the vent , this situation",
    "is called the fumaroleregime .",
    "besides , we have noticed that a toy geyser working in a fumarole regime can be brought back to a periodic regime by increasing the height @xmath4 of the water in the pool . the minimal pool height which leads to a periodic regime",
    "can be discussed quantitatively . during an eruption , when the water in the reservoir has reached its equilibrium temperature @xmath16 , the specific heating power @xmath5 only induces water vaporization .",
    "thus , the mass of water vapor produced per unit time is @xmath83 and imposes a mean gas velocity in the vent @xmath84 . if the dynamic pressure @xmath85 associated to the vapor flow at the exit of the vent is larger than the hydrostatic pressure @xmath86 ( where @xmath87 is the water density ) at the bottom of the pool , the water will not re - entry in the vent and the system will stay in a fumarole regime .",

    "the maximal specific heat power is @xmath74 which explains why a geyser regime was always observed . in order to test the validity of eq .",

    ", we found a critical height of water @xmath95 mm which is consistent with the previous law .",
    "in the description of the toy geyser done previously , we have considered that the heat power injected in the system is entirely transferred to the reservoir .",
    "actually , thermal convection can transfer a part of the injected heat power from the reservoir to the vent and to the pool .",
    "the thermal energy per unit time conveyed in the vent can be expressed as @xmath96 with @xmath97 the heat transfert coefficient in the case of vertical natural convection in a vertical pipe heated from below .",
    "this coefficient depends on the rayleigh number and the grashof number but stays between 100 and 1000 @xmath98 in the range of parameter encountered in our experiments @xcite .",
    "the limit case where the convective flux is equal to the injected heat power @xmath99 occurs for a critical vent radius    @xmath100    for @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath101 and @xmath102 we get @xmath103 .",
    "this approach explains why thermal convection in the vent has been neglected in the experiments presented in section [ sec : experiments ] for which @xmath90 .",
    "indeed , in such a situation the convective flux is about 200 times smaller than the injected heat power .",
    "finally , one expects that for a vent radius larger than @xmath104 , the injected heat power will be transferred to the entire volume of water and boiling will occur everywhere .",
    "this regime of the toy geyser is called the boiling springregime in the following of this paper .",
    "the three transitions discussed previously between the different regimes of a toy geyser can be gathered on a single diagram which is presented in fig . [",

    "such behavior may be attributed to a change in external parameters such as the water inflow , the atmospheric temperature and pressure , tidal forces and tectonic stress @xcite or be the result of the internal mechanism of geysers .",
