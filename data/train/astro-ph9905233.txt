    "mercury - manganese ( hgmn ) stars are a class of chemically peculiar ( cp ) upper main sequence stars which show bizarre atomic and isotopic abundance patterns in their spectra .",
    "they tend to show large overabundances of mn , pt , au , hg , and several other elements . many are helium - weak .",
    "one of the striking peculiarities found in hgmn stars is the presence of unusual isotopic abundance mixtures for hg , pt , and tl which can not be explained by any known nuclear processes .",
    "the origins of the chemical peculiarities in hgmn and other cp stars are still an open question .",
    "until quite recently , it was generally accepted that radiation pressure driven diffusion was causing the peculiar atomic and isotopic abundances observed in hgmn stars : radiation pressure levitates hg , mn , etc .",
    "ions in the atmosphere , concentrating them in the line - forming region of stars which began with `` normal '' abundances ( michaud 1970 , michaud , reeves , &  charland 1974 ) .",
    "some recent works have found that it is difficult to explain the hg atomic and isotopic abundances using diffusion alone .",
    "proffitt et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) report that at no level in the photosphere of @xmath1  lupi , a bright hgmn star observed in detail with the hst , is the radiation force on hg greater than the gravitational force , making it impossible for diffusion in the photosphere to create the observed hg overabundance .",
    "woolf &  lambert ( 1999 ) found hg isotopic mixtures in two hgmn stars , 11  per and hr  7245 , which are very difficult , if not impossible , to explain using diffusion alone .",
    "these recent developments make it important to explore other processes which may contribute to creating the peculiar abundances in hgmn stars .",
    "these include light induced drift , diffusion below the photosphere , disorganized magnetic fields , and winds .",
    "stellar parameters which may influence the mechanisms which create peculiar abundances include temperature , surface gravity , initial chemical composition , stellar rotation , magnetic fields , presence of a binary companion , and stellar age .",
    "exploration of this multi - parameter space should yield clues to the origins of cp stars in general and hgmn stars in particular .    as part of an exploration of hgmn stars and stellar ages ,",
    "we have observed late b and early a stars in the orion  ob1 association .",
    "the orion  ob1 association contains subgroups which are among the youngest spectroscopically observable clusters .",
    "the detection of very young cp stars puts an observational upper limit on the length of time needed to produce their chemical peculiarities .",
    "stars were selected for observation from known orion  ob1 stars listed in warren &  hesser ( 1978 ) and were found using using simbad coordinates and , when necessary , the star charts of warren &  hesser ( 1977 ) and parenago ( 1954 ) .",
    "observations were made at mcdonald observatory 1998 december 2428 and 1999 march 511 using the cross dispersed echelle spectrometer at the coud focus of the 2.7  m telescope ( tull et  al .",
    "the resolving power was approximately 60,000 . since the spectra were to be used to search for cp stars , not high precision abundance analyses , very high signal - to - noise spectra were not a priority , though stars were re - observed to provide higher signal if interesting spectral features were detected . most spectra had signal - to - noise ratios between 70 and 100 . at these low signal - to - noise levels we may not detect some cp stars with broad lines and/or only weakly enhanced abundances .",
    "spectra were reduced using standard iraf procedures for bias and scattered light subtraction , flat lamp division , spectrum reduction , and thar wavelength calibration .",
    "hd  37492 and bd@xmath0984 were found to have detectable 3984    hg  ii lines .",
    "bd@xmath0984 and hd  37886 were found to have mn  ii lines which were obviously enhanced on visual inspection .",
    "the signal - to - noise levels in spectra used for abundance analysis for these three stars varies with wavelength . in the spectral order containing the 3984    hg  ii line signal - to - noise",
    "is about 70 , 200 , and 140 in hd  37886 , bd@xmath0984 , and hd  37492 , respectively .",
    "mn abundances were calculated from equivalent widths of mn  ii lines using moog ( sneden 1973 ) . for hd  37886 , hd  37492 , and bd@xmath0984 , 31 , 18 , and 43 lines were used , respectively , with @xmath2 values and wavelengths obtained from the vald database ( piskunov et  al .",
    "1995 ) in which most mn  ii data are originally taken from kurucz ( 1994 ) .",
    "no corrections were made for desaturation due to hyperfine splitting of mn  ii lines in this analysis .",
    "this may cause us to overestimate mn abundances ( jomaron , dworetsky , &  allen 1999 ) .",
    "however , calculating @xmath3(mn ) for bd@xmath0984 using only the 12 lines with equivalent widths smaller than 35  m , which should not be strongly affected by hyperfine desaturation , gives the same abundance as a calculation including the stronger lines .",
    "corrections made to mn abundances due to hyperfine splitting and possible line blending would still leave mn enhanced in all three of these stars .",
    "hg abundances were estimated by fitting synthetic spectra to the 3984    hg  ii line using moog as described in woolf &   lambert ( 1999 ) .",
    "calculations were made using individual isotopic and hyperfine components and varying hg isotopic abundances independently of each other .",
    "the reported hg abundance is the sum of the isotopic abundances .",
    "the model atmosphere used for the estimates was calculated with atlas9 ( kurucz 1993 ) .",
    "t@xmath4 and log@xmath5 were estimated using stromgren _",
    "uvby_@xmath6 photometry ( mermilliod , mermilliod , &  hauck 1997 ) and a fortran program ( moon 1985 , napiwotzki , schnberner , &  wenske 1993 ) which interpolates the grids of moon &  dworetsky ( 1985 ) .",
    "microturbulences were estimated by requiring that there be no slope in @xmath3(fe  ii ) vs equivalent width for each star .    in the 1999 march 10 spectrum of hd  37492",
    "most of the strong lines , though not the mn  ii lines , have a weaker line just to the blue , indicating that hd  37492 is a double - lined binary with a hgmn primary and a non - hgmn secondary .",
    "the presence of a binary companion was not taken into account when using photometry to calculate stellar parameters or calculating abundances using equivalent width or spectral synthesis analysis .",
    "the actual effective temperature of the primary is probably hotter than that used and the equivalent widths of the lines would be larger if a correction was made for the companion s continuum flux contribution .",
    "figure  [ f1 ] shows the spectral region containing the 3984    hg  ii line in the hgmn stars hd  37886 , bd@xmath0984 , and hd  37492 .",
    "table  1 gives the values for t@xmath4 , log@xmath5 , and @xmath7 used in the abundance determinations ; the @xmath8sin@xmath9 values ; fe , mn , and hg abundances ; and central wavelengths and equivalent widths of the 3984    hg  ii line found for the three stars .",
    "the central wavelengths of the hg  ii lines of bd@xmath0984 and hd  37492 imply that they have hg isotopic compositions similar to those of the sharp - lined hgmn stars hr  1800 , @xmath10  crb , and hr  4072 ( woolf &  lambert 1999 ) : their hg mixtures are weighted toward the heavier isotopes , as are the mixtures of the large majority of hgmn stars , though not as strongly as in @xmath1  lupi or other stars which show pure @xmath11hg .",
    "hg is very overabundant in hd  37492 and bd@xmath0984 .",
    "the 3984    hg  ii line is undetectable in hd  37886 .",
    "the hg abundances in hgmn stars range from undetectable to about @xmath12 or 680,000 times the solar system abundance . ]",
    "( smith 1997 ) .",
    "mn is overabundant in hd  37886 , bd@xmath0984 , and hd  37492 .",
    "mn abundances in hgmn stars have been previously reported to be as large as @xmath13 or about 400 times the solar abundance ( smith &  dworetsky 1993 , jomaron et  al .",
    "the mn abundance found for bd@xmath0984 , about 800 times solar , is large even for a hgmn star , though its large uncertainty would allow its mn abundance to be as low as 300 times solar .",
    "the hg and mn abundances found for these three stars show that they are hgmn stars .",
    "the lack of a detectable hg line in hd  37886 is unusual for a hgmn star , but not unique .",
    "for example , 53  tau , hr  2676 , and 30  cap also have no detectable 3984    line ( smith 1997 , woolf &  lambert 1999 ) .",
    "hd  37886 and other hgmn stars not strongly enhanced in hg do not have temperatures , gravities , or microturbulences which would distinguish them from other hgmn stars .",
    "an in - depth study of known low - hg hgmn stars may suggest clues to the mechanisms creating cp stars .",
    "two stars out of 38 b8 to a2 stars observed in orion  ob1b were found to be hgmn stars .",
    "one star out of 23 b8 to a2 stars observed in orion  ob1c was found to be a hgmn star .",
    "no hgmn stars were found in orion  ob1d , the trapezium cluster , but only 11 b and a stars were observed in ob1d , so the non - detection does not necessarily put a lower limit on the time scale to create a hgmn star .",
    "no stars other than the three hgmn stars discovered had detectable 3984    hg  ii lines or mn  ii lines in the 3800    to 9900    region .    detecting a hgmn star",
    "depends on how enhanced the hg and/or mn lines are , the star s @xmath8sin@xmath9 , the noise level of the spectrum , and the wavelength region observed .",
    "we can not rule out the possibility that one or more of the stars we observed is a hgmn star but that we failed to detect it because it is only weakly enhanced in hg and mn and has a high @xmath8sin@xmath9 : the higher the @xmath8sin@xmath9 , the stronger the line has to be to be detected .",
    "for example , in stars with @xmath14 we can rule out hg abundances greater than @xmath15 , but for stars with @xmath16 and signal to noise of about 80 we would not detect the hg  ii line for @xmath17 , depending somewhat on temperature , gravity , and isotopic mix .",
    "twenty of the 38 b8 to a2 stars observed in orion  ob1b and 11 of the 23 stars observed in orion  ob1c had @xmath18 , the limit normally quoted for hgmn stars .",
    "the number of hgmn stars found in our search is not inconsistent with what would be expected in field stars .",
    "approximately 5% of a0 stars and 12% of b9 stars are hgmn stars ( smith 1996 ) .",
    "the orion  ob1 association is divided into four subgroups : 1a , 1b , 1c , and 1d .",
    "the groups are @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22  myr old , respectively ( brown , de  geus , & zeeuw 1994 ) .",
    "hd  37492 in the orion  ob1c subgroup is presumably about 4.6  million years old .",
    "hd  37886 and bd@xmath0984 are in the orion  ob1b subgroup and are probably between 0.6 and 2.8  million years old .",
    "the age determinations of brown et  al . differ from previous reports which found ob1b , at about 5  myrs , older than ob1c , at about 4  myrs .",
    "( warren &  hesser 1978 ) .",
    "brown et  al .",
    "( 1994 ) estimated ages using theoretical isochrones .",
    "warren &  hesser ( 1978 ) estimated ages using the bluest main sequence stars .",
    "hgmn stars have been found in other young clusters .",
    "the hgmn stars hr  1690 and hr  1800 are in the 11.4  million year old orion  ob1a .",
    "the hgmn star hr  5998 is in the 5 to 8  million year old ( de  geus , de  zeeuw , &  lub 1989 , de  zeeuw &  brand 1985 ) upper scorpius subgroup of the scorpius - centaurus ob association .",
    "the hgmn star hd  47553 is in the 6.5  million year old ngc  2264 ( malysheva 1997 , pyatkes 1993 ) .",
    "the ages determined for these young clusters are still fairly uncertain and there is apparently an age spread among the stars in each cluster .",
    "hd  37886 and bd@xmath0984 in orion  ob1b are the youngest known hgmn stars in a cluster of a known age .",
    "the time scales for the various processes which have been proposed as causes of the chemical peculiarities in hgmn stars are not very well known .",
    "michaud ( 1970 ) calculated a radiative diffusion time scale of about @xmath23 years .",
    "more recently , seaton ( 1998 , 1999 ) calculated that for some fe peak elements , such as mn and ni , the time for diffusion to create maximum concentrations is increased to about @xmath24  years by the need for atoms to pass through a region where ions have ar - like electronic configurations which have few strong absorption lines in the wavelength region where the stellar flux is strong .",
    "however , as discussed in the introduction , calculations by proffitt et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) have shown that the model of michaud ( 1970 ) in which hg is concentrated by radiative diffusion alone will not work in the hgmn star @xmath1  lupi .",
    "we know of no calculations of time scales for light induced drift , diffusion below the photosphere , or other proposed element concentrating processes .",
    "diffusion , light induced drift , and other processes which require a quiescent atmosphere to operate would only have an effect after the he  ii convection zone disappears in a young star as he diffuses out of the bottom of the zone .",
    "it is possible that the time scale for the he  ii convection zone to disappear , on the order of @xmath25 years ( vauclair , vauclair , &  pamjatnikh 1974 ) , is the major limiting factor on how quickly hgmn stars can be produced .",
    "the three very young hgmn stars in orion  ob1b and ob1c show different abundance patterns .",
    "hd  37886 is enhanced in mn but not in hg .",
    "hd  37492 is fairly sharp - lined and strongly enhanced in hg but only weakly in mn .",
    "bd@xmath0984 is broad - lined and is strongly enhanced in both hg and mn .",
    "its spectrum is almost identical in both line strengths and line broadening to that of @xmath26  and , the first hgmn star identified .",
    "the hgmn stars found in orion provide constraints for models developed to explain hgmn star peculiarities .",
    "their youth means that the peculiarities develop quickly , and possibly in the pre - main sequence phase .",
    "pre - main sequence chemical peculiarities could be produced as a result of fractionation of accretion from a circumstellar shell or disk .",
    "the differences in the hg and mn abundances in stars in the same association mean that age and initial chemical composition do not alone determine the abundance patterns seen in hgmn stars .",
