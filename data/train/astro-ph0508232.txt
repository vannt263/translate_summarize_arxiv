    "the range of hi  column densities typically seen in routine 21-cm emission line observations of the neutral gas disks in nearby galaxies is very similar to those that characterise the damped lyman-@xmath6 systems or dlas with @xmath7 .",
    "an attractive experiment would therefore be to map the hi  gas of dla absorbing systems in 21-cm emission , and measure the dlas total gas mass , the extent of the gas disks and their dynamics .",
    "this would provide a direct observational link between dlas and local galaxies , but unfortunately such studies are impossible with present technology ( see e.g. , kanekar et al .",
    "the transition probability of the hyperfine splitting that causes the 21-cm line is extremely small , resulting in a weak line that can only be observed in emission in the very local ( @xmath8 ) universe , with present technology . on the other hand ,",
    "the identification of dlas as absorbers in background qso spectra is , to first order , not distance dependent because the detection efficiency depends mostly on the brightness of the background source , not on the redshift of the absorber itself .",
    "in fact , the lowest redshift ( @xmath9 ) lyman-@xmath6 absorbers can not be observed from the ground because the earth s atmosphere is opaque to the uv wavelength range in which these are to be found .",
    "furthermore , due to the expansion of the universe the redshift number density of dlas decreases rapidly toward lower redshifts . consequently , there are not many dlas known whose 21-cm emission would be within the reach of present - day radio telescopes .",
    "so , we are left with a wealth of information on the cold gas properties in local galaxies , which has been collected over the last half century , and several hundreds dla absorption profiles at intermediate and high redshift , but little possibility to bridge these two sets of information . obviously , most observers resort to the optical wavelengths to study dlas but attempts to directly image their host galaxies have been notably unsuccessful ( see e.g. , warren et al .",
    "2001 and mller et al .",
    "2002 for reviews ) .",
    "a few positive identifications do exist , mostly the result of hst imaging .",
    "although the absolute number of dlas at low @xmath3 is small , the success rate for finding low-@xmath3 host galaxies is better for obvious reasons : the host galaxies are expected to be brighter and the separation on the sky between the bright qso and the dla galaxy is likely larger .",
    "early surveys for low-@xmath3 dla host galaxies consisted of broad band imaging and lacked spectroscopic follow - up ( e.g. , le brun et al.1997 ) .",
    "later studies aimed at measuring redshifts to determine the association of optically identified galaxies with dlas , either spectroscopically ( e.g. , rao et al . 2003 ) , or using photometric redshifts ( chen & lanzetta 2003 ) . all together , there are now @xmath10 dla galaxies known at @xmath11 .",
    "the galaxies span a wide range in galaxy properties , ranging from inconspicuous lsb dwarfs to giant spirals and even early type galaxies .",
    "obviously , it is not just the luminous , high surface brightness spiral galaxies that contribute to the hi  cross section above the dla threshold . as explained above",
    ", we can not study these galaxies in the 21-cm line on a case - by - case basis , but we can do a study of a statistical nature to see if the properties of dlas and dla galaxies agree with our knowledge of hi  in the local universe .",
    "blind 21-cm emission line surveys in the local universe with single dish radio telescopes such as parkes or arecibo have resulted in an accurate measurement of @xmath12 , which can be used as a reference point for higher redshift dla studies .",
    "@xmath13 is simply calculated by integrating over the hi  mass function of galaxies , which is measured with surveys such as hipass ( zwaan et al .",
    "however , due to the large beam widths of the singe dish instruments , these surveys at best only barely resolve the detected galaxies and are therefore not very useful in constraining the column density distribution function of @xmath0 hi .",
    "hence , for this purpose we use the high resolution 21-cm maps of a large sample of local galaxies that have been observed with the westerbork synthesis radio telescope .",
    "this sample is known as whisp ( van der hulst et al . 2001 ) and consists of 355 galaxies spanning a large range in hi  mass and optical luminosity .",
    "the total number of independent column density measurements above the dla limit is @xmath14 , which implies that the data volume of our present study is the equivalent of @xmath14 dlas at @xmath1 !    each galaxy in the sample",
    "is weighted according to the hi  mass function of galaxies .",
    "we can now calculate the column density distribution function , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the area function that describes for galaxies with hi  mass  the area in @xmath17 corresponding to a column density in the range  to @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the hi  mass function .",
    "@xmath20 converts the number of systems per mpc to that per unit redshift .",
    "figure  [ whispfn2.fig ] shows the resulting  on the left , and the derived hi  mass density per decade of  on the right . for comparison with higher redshift observations",
    ", we also plot the results from two other studies .",
    "the proux ( 2005 ) measurements of  below the dla limit are the result of their new uves survey for `` sub - dlas '' .",
    "the intermediate redshift points from rao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) are based on mgii - selected dla systems .",
    "the surprising result from this figure is that there appears to be only very mild evolution in the intersection cross section of hi  from redshift @xmath21 to the present . from this figure",
    "we can determine the redshift number density of @xmath22 gas and find that @xmath23 , in good agreement with earlier measurements at @xmath1 .",
    "compared to the most recent measurements of @xmath24 at intermediate and high @xmath3 , this implies that the comoving number density ( or the `` space density times cross section '' ) of dlas does not evolve after @xmath4 . in other words",
    ", the local galaxy population explains the incidence rate of low and intermediate @xmath3 dlas and there is no need for a population of hidden very low surface brightness ( lsb ) galaxies or isolated hi  clouds ( dark galaxies ) .",
    "the right hand panel shows that at @xmath1 most of the hi  atoms are in column densities around @xmath25 .",
    "this also seems to be the case at higher redshifts , although the distribution might flatten somewhat .",
    "the one point that clearly deviates is the highest  point from rao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) at @xmath26 .",
    "the figure very clearly demonstrates that this point dominates the  measurement at intermediate redshifts .",
    "it is therefore important to understand whether the mgii - based results really indicate that high column densities ( @xmath27 ) are rare at high and low redshift , but much more ubiquitous at intermediate redshifts , or whether the mgii  selection introduces currently unidentified biases .",
    "now that we have accurate cross section measurement of all galaxies in our sample , and know what the space density of our galaxies is , we can calculate the cross - section weighted probability distribution functions of various galaxy parameters .",
    "figure  [ pdfs.fig ] shows two examples .",
    "the left panel shows the @xmath28-band absolute magnitude distribution of cross - section selected galaxies above four different hi  column density cut - offs .",
    "87% of the dla cross - section appears to be in galaxies that are fainter than @xmath29 , and 45% is in galaxies with @xmath30 .",
    "these numbers agree very well with the luminosity distribution of @xmath11 dla host galaxies .",
    "taking into account the non - detections of dla host galaxies and assuming that these are @xmath31 , we find that 80% of the @xmath11 dla galaxies are sub-@xmath29 .",
    "the median absolute magnitude of a @xmath1 dla galaxy is expected to be @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the conclusion to draw from this is that we should not be surprised to find that identifying dla host galaxies is difficult .",
    "most of them ( some 87% ) are expected to be sub-@xmath29 and many are dwarfs .    using similar techniques , we find that the expected median impact parameter of @xmath34 systems is 7.8 kpc , whereas the median impact parameter of identified @xmath11 dla galaxies is 8.3 kpc . assuming no evolution in the properties of galaxies gas disks , these numbers imply that 37% of the impact parameters are expected to be less than @xmath35 for systems at @xmath36 .",
    "this illustrates that very high spatial resolution imaging programs are required to successfully identify a typical dla galaxy at intermediate redshifts .",
    "the right panel in figure  [ pdfs.fig ] shows the probability distribution of oxygen abundance in @xmath1 dlas .",
    "we constructed this diagram by assigning to every hi  pixel in our 21-cm maps an oxygen abundance , based on the assumption that the galaxies in our sample follow the local metallicity  luminosity ( @xmath37 ) relation ( e.g. garnett 2002 ) , and that each disk shows an abundance gradient of [ o / h ] of @xmath38 ( e.g. , ferguson et al .",
    "1998 ) along the major axis .",
    "the solid lines correspond to these assumptions , the dotted lines are for varying metallicity gradients in disks of different absolute brightness .",
    "the main conclusion is that the metallicity distribution for hi  column densities @xmath34 peaks around [ o / h]=@xmath39 to @xmath40 , much lower than the mean value of an @xmath29 galaxy of [ o / h]@xmath41 .",
    "the reason for this being that _ 1 ) _ much of the dla cross section is in sub-@xmath29 galaxies , which mostly have sub - solar metallicities , and _ 2 ) _ for the more luminous , larger galaxies , the highest interception probability is at larger impact parameters from the centre , where the metallicity is lower .",
    "interestingly , this number is very close to the @xmath1 extrapolations of metallicity measurements in dlas at higher @xmath3 from prochaska et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and kulkarni et al .",
    "for the mean mass - weighted metallicity of hi  gas with @xmath34 at @xmath1 we find the value of @xmath42 , also consistent with the @xmath1 extrapolation of -weighted metallicities in dlas , although we note this extrapolation has large uncertainties given the poor statistics from dlas at @xmath43 .",
    "these results are in good agreement with the hypothesis that dlas arise in the hi  disks of galaxies .",
    "the local galaxy population can explain the incidence rate and metallicities of dlas , the luminosities of their host galaxies , and the impact parameters between centres of host galaxies and the background qsos .      1 chen , h.  & lanzetta , k.  m.  2003 , apj , 597 , 706 ferguson a.  m.  n. , gallagher j.  s. , wyse r.  f.  g. , 1998 , aj , 116 , 673 garnett d.  r. , 2002 , apj , 581 , 1019 kanekar n. , chengalur j.  n. , subrahmanyan r. , petitjean p. , 2001",
