    "shallow impurities photoelectric spectroscopy ( sips ) of hydrogen like impurities consists in arising of lines in photoconductivity spectra of semiconductor , when electrons localized on impurities are photo excited resonantly .",
    "it is an effective method for investigations of si in semiconductors[1 ] .",
    "considerable information can be obtained from the investigations of the line broadening mechanisms [ 2 - 4 ] and experimental line width .",
    "convenient for this purpose are optically allowed transition lines from the ground state of si @xmath2 to excited zeeman states @xmath3 and @xmath4 formed in magnetic field @xmath5 . even for available purest samples of si ,",
    "ge , gaas , inp the low temperature si photoexcitation lines dominant broadening mechanism is concentration mechanism ( inhomogeneous broadening ) .",
    "this broadening is the result of optical transition ( for example @xmath6 ) energy differences for all impurity atoms from that of isolated impurity atom owing to interaction with surrounding impurities . in particular , in compensated semiconductors ( @xmath7 ) with charged impurities concentration @xmath8 comparable with @xmath9at moderate magnetic fields ( @xmath10 , @xmath11-cyclotron energy , @xmath12- effective ridberg ) , when quadrupole - electric field gradient broadening for @xmath13 lines is negligible[2 ] , the broadening of @xmath14 line arise from the quadratic stark effect shift of levels by charged impurities electric fields @xmath15 . then the line shape would be determined by distribution of @xmath16 at the neutral donor center , which depends on charged impurity distribution in semiconductor .",
    "character of distribution of charged impurity around the optically active neutral donor depends on two factors .",
    "the first is the distribution of impurity atoms in semiconductor , which mainly is determined with growing technology ( we consider the residual impurities only ) .",
    "the inhomogeneous in impurity distribution creates the random potential which is the potential of fluctuations .",
    "the influence of this potential on cyclotron resonance line shape was established [ 5 ] and was used for quality control of semiconductor samples with nearly equal neutral and charged impurity concentrations [ 6].the second is how the electrons are distributed on impurities . in the case of high temperature limit @xmath17",
    "it is a random distribution .",
    "but in the zero temperature limit the distribution is correlated , which provides the coulomb interaction energy of system of charged acceptors , donors and electrons to be minimized . in the random electron distribution case",
    "the @xmath14 transition line width depends on charged impurity concentration @xmath18 only , independently on sample compensation @xmath1 [ 2 - 3 ] . in the correlated distribution case acceptors",
    "are charged taking electrons from nearest donor . then with the same value of @xmath18",
    "the line width is smaller and strongly depends on @xmath19 .",
    "distribution transforms from the correlated to the random at temperatures [ 7 ] @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the mean distance between charged impurities , @xmath22- static dielectric constant , @xmath23 - the boltzman constant ) . in the case of strong inhomogeneous impurity system",
    "they are collected into the clusters , which have higher ionized impurity concentration ( because of pure regions are between them ) than that of mean value for all sample , determined from hall measurements .",
    "note that only these clusters are optically active for impurity absorption of radiation .",
    "so , strong inhomogeneous in the impurity distribution must cause an additional broadening mechanism for impurity absorption lines .",
    "note that the distribution can be changed from correlated to random not with heating only , but under any external perturbation increasing the energy , for example , an electric field .",
    "this work devoted to experimental investigations of the sips line broadening caused by si inhomogeneous distribution in @xmath24-gaas epitaxial layers obtained by liquid and gas phase epitaxy .",
    "we investigate the @xmath14 transition line shape of residual donors in @xmath25 using the laser magnetic photoelectric spectroscopy method at moderate magnetic fields up to 6.5 t. photoconductivity spectra ( ps ) of samples were registered at fixed far infrared @xmath26 and @xmath27 -lasers radiation at wavelengths @xmath28 and @xmath29 as a function of magnetic field in the intervals @xmath30 and @xmath31 correspondingly .",
    "ps were measured at different electric fields- from linear region of samples cvc up to si break down electric field values . at electric fields smaller than the break down",
    "one the constant voltage regime @xmath32 and at the break down the constant current regime @xmath33 was used . in order the true line shape to be registered the precaution",
    "was taken the pc , which is proportional to the change of sample conductivity @xmath34 , to be linear to radiation intensity in both regimes .",
    "parameters of samples and growth technology are given in table1.samples of @xmath25 obtained by liquid phase ( lp ) and gas phase ( gp ) growth technology were used .",
    "the pc measurements were carried out by cross - modulation method with modulation frequency of radiation intensity @xmath35 @xmath36 .    for samples investigated the random distribution of electrons takes place at temperatures @xmath37 .",
    "so we suppose that at measurements temperature @xmath38 in the linear region of cvc the distribution is nearly correlated .",
    "the results of @xmath14 line shape investigations for different n - gaas samples are given in table .",
    "the width @xmath39 was measured at the half height of the line in magnetic unites @xmath40 and then it was transformed into energetic unites @xmath41 .",
    "the rapidity of @xmath6 transition energy increase in magnetic field @xmath42 @xmath43 was determined from the two magnetic field positions ( as indicated in fig 1 ) of this line at different laser quantum energy @xmath44 and @xmath45 .",
    "first we will analyze the @xmath14 line shape at small electric fields far from the break down one.the main results are given below .    as seen from table",
    "it is hard ( except the purest sample7 ) to find any correlation between the line width and si  concentration , on the one hand , and degree of compensation on the other hand , in the intervals @xmath46@xmath47 , @xmath48 . as a rule samples obtained by lp technology have relatively broader si @xmath14 photoexcitation lines than those obtained by gp technology .",
    "for example in spite of higher charged impurity concentration and compensation degree in sample1 , sample5 has almost twice broader @xmath14 donors lines in the linear cvc region .",
    "this fact can be explained only by more inhomogeneous distribution of si in lp samples .",
    "the quantities @xmath49 and @xmath50 usually determined from hall measurements temperature dependency , are mean values for all sample volume .",
    "when impurities are distributed homogeneously then @xmath49 and @xmath19 values in any part of sample equal to the mean values obtained from hall measurements given in table1.in the strong inhomogeneouse distribution case in the optically active parts of sample , where absorption of radiation takes place , the impurities form clusters with higher concentration than its mean value .",
    "it is obvious that this will cause to broaden the lines .    except the purest",
    ", all samples have symmetric line shape as it is shown in figure1 for two of them . only very high purity sample s line shape is asymmetric ( figure2 ) , having nearly all width at lower energy ( or higher magnetic field ) side , as it must be for quadratic stark effect broadening mechanism .",
    "it is also notable that the line width of all samples ( except the purest ) with @xmath51 are not depend on magnetic field value as it can be seen from the comparison of ps at different magnetic fields for two samples shown in figure 1.but for both knowing inhomogeneouse ( quadratic stark and quadrupole - gradient ) broadening mechanisms in the indicated regions of magnetic fields the @xmath14 line width must decrease with increasing of magnetic field .",
    "narrowing of @xmath52 donor s lines with magnetic field increasing was observed in very pure n - gaas samples[8 ] .",
    "all above given experimental results witnesses that we deal with an additional inhomogeneouse si line broadening mechanism connected with inhomogeneouse distribution of impurities .",
    "the energy of fluctuations increases with increasing of impurity concentration and compensation degree as @xmath53 [ 7 ] and in n- gaas at concentrations @xmath54 it becomes sips lines dominant broadening mechanism .",
    "note that for samples used in table1 the value of @xmath55 mev is about experimental line width . because of this potential depends not only on impurity concentration , but on distribution character of si also , this broadening mechanism can be used in quality control of samples with nearly @xmath49 and @xmath56    this conclusion is in accordance with the results of our investigations of line width dependence on electric field .",
    "it was found that at electric fields smaller than break down the dependence of @xmath14 sips line width on electric field is different for different samples.in figure 3 this dependence is shown for two samples with inhomogeneouse and homogeneous si distribution . with increasing of applied electric field smaller than break down , we observed both- increasing as well as decreasing line width ( curves 1 and 2 in fig3 ) . at ",
    "candlelike break down region of cvc for all samples drastic narrowing of @xmath14 sips lines takes place [ 9 ] .",
    "the narrowing at break down is the result of screening of charged impurity coulomb potential by free electrons arising in result of theirs avalanche throwing from the part neutral donors into the conduction band .",
    "if consider electric fields smaller than break down , the experiments show that only in inhomogeneous samples we have a gradual narrowing of @xmath6 sips lines with increasing of electric field , as it indicated in fig.3 ( curve 1).this can be explained in the following way .",
    "far wings of line in ps correspond to those neutral donors which are placed at high potential fluctuations and as a consequence around them the charged impurity concentration is higher than the mean value for sample .",
    "external voltage applied on inhomogeneous sample will distributed inhomogeneously creating more electric field values in parts of sample with higher charged impurity concentration . on the other hand in clusters with high impurity concentration",
    "the potential of ionization must be lowered ( for example in mott transition case , when @xmath57 , for n - gaas taking place at @xmath58 the si break down potential is zero because all donor electrons already are free ) .",
    "for this reason with increasing of electric field the neutral donors in clusters with high impurity concentration ( which cause the pc signal far from the line center ) must to be ionized the first .",
    "in turn this would cause narrowing of @xmath6 line .    for samples with homogeneous si distribution at fields @xmath59 the @xmath6 line width increase with electric field.the typical @xmath6 line width dependence on applied voltage for gp samples",
    "is shown in fig.3 ( curve1 ) .",
    "our comparison of theories for uncorrelated [ 3 ] @xmath17 and correlated [ 4 ] @xmath60 electron distributions the quadratic stark broadening calculations for gaas sample with @xmath61@xmath47and @xmath62 shows that in the first case the charged impurities electric field distribution function @xmath63 gives the @xmath14 line an order of magnitude ( 20 times ) broader . in the first case",
    "we take @xmath64 after the analogy of holtzmark distribution , where @xmath15- electric field in units of @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "so , we believe that at @xmath67 an external electric field changes the electron distribution towards to uncorrelated , so that to explain the 1.5 times broadening of the @xmath14 line , as it was observed for gp sample1 .",
    "note that as it is seen from curve 1 of fig",
    ". 3 strong increase of line width takes place near the break down field .",
    "note that near the break down field electron distribution changes must be strong .",
    "another experiment directly shows that the external electric field smaller than @xmath68 considerably changes the distribution of electrons on donors .",
    "if , there are different kinds of si in semiconductor with comparable concentrations , as it is shown in ps of samples1 , 6 and 7 , the real ground state would be the @xmath69 state of donor having maximal chemical shift value ( the first line of ps in magnetic field ) . as a result of this , at low temperature , when electron distribution is correlated , the acceptors must , basically , to be charged on account of donors having minimum central cell correction ( chemical shift ) value ( the last line of ps in magnetic field ) . in fig.4",
    "the dependence on electric field is shown for the relation of intensities of these lines @xmath70 indicated as 1 and 2 in ps shown in sketch .",
    "the difference in ground state energy for these donors obtained from magnetic field positions of corresponding lines ( @xmath71 @xmath72 ) is about @xmath73 @xmath74 .",
    "as seen from fig.4 the relative population of donors 1 by electrons- @xmath70 increases with increasing of electric field about @xmath75 .",
    "the growth technology for lp @xmath25 films on @xmath76 bulk samples requires substantially higher temperature than for the gp samples .",
    "this is the reason why lp samples in comparison with the gp ones have more inhomogeneous si distribution .",
    "the new broadening mechanism of @xmath14 sips lines were established which takes place in n - gaas samples with @xmath54 and connected with fluctuations of potential arising as a result of si inhomogeneous distribution in samples . at @xmath59 homogeneous and inhomogeneous si distribution in samples causes the different dependence on external electric field for line width .",
    "results obtained extends the opportunity of n - gaas samples quality control by sips method .",
    "in particular , they allows to check more homogeneous sample among having nearly equal @xmath49 and @xmath19 .",
    "samples used in this work with their @xmath49 , @xmath19 and @xmath77 parameters are from different sources ; samples 2 - 5 from dr.t.s.lagunova , 1 and 6 from dr.y .",
