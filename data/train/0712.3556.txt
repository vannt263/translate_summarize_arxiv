    "the above equation gives back the expression of @xmath192 derived in section iv - b of paper i with the temperature set to zero .    before closing this discussion of the rfim , we would like to emphasize a few additional points which parallel the comments made in the previous subsection .",
    "first , the appearance of a cusp in @xmath156 is associated with the divergence of the second derivative @xmath205 . due to the nonlinear character of the flow equation for @xmath205 , eq . ( [ eq_delta2_ising ] ) ,",
    "this divergence , if present , is expected to first occur at a finite scale which , as before , we generically call the `` larkin scale '' . for a running scale @xmath21 larger than the larkin scale @xmath206 ,",
    "the effective average action is analytic and it develops a cusp ( in @xmath156 ) for @xmath21 less than @xmath206 . from the flow equation for @xmath156 , one can see that a linear cusp is stable under rg flow , in that it does not lead to stronger `` supercusps '' .",
    "secondly , the appearance of a `` subcusp '' in @xmath156 is signaled by the divergence of a higher - order derivative @xmath194 , with @xmath207 being related to the order of the nonanalyticity ( which is strictly less than @xmath170 and strictly more than @xmath208 ) .",
    "the flow equation for @xmath194 being linear , a subcusp can only appear at infinite rg time , _",
    "i.e. _ , at the fixed point . following the reasoning developed in appendix a , we conclude that the order of the nonanalyticity characterizing the fixed point increases as @xmath209 when @xmath0 approaches @xmath210 from below . this is the counterpart of the situation found near @xmath7 where the order of the nonanalyticity increases as @xmath211 when the number of components @xmath4 gets large . in both cases",
    "the critical fixed points with fully analytic ( dimensionless ) effective action found above @xmath54 and when @xmath212 are approached in @xmath0 or @xmath4 by fixed points with diverging orders of the nonanalyticity , _",
    "i.e. _ , with weaker and weaker subcusps .",
    "we recall however that such subcusps are not sufficient to break dimensional reduction .",
    "the preceding developments on the connection between breakdown of dimensional reduction and nonanalyticity of the effective average action can be extended to the whole @xmath3 plane .",
    "the nonanalyticity now occurs in the renormalized cumulants of the disorder as two arguments , _",
    "i.e. _ , two replica fields , approach each other , @xmath213 . if the nonanalyticity is weak enough , namely , if it is weaker than a linear cusp in the second cumulant of the renormalized random field , the rg flows for @xmath214 ( see section iv - c of paper i ) decouple from those involving distinct replica fields .",
    "the associated fixed point can be continuously followed in the @xmath3 plane and , near @xmath54 , near @xmath7 for @xmath115 and when @xmath55 , it leads to dimensional reduction . for reasons explained above , a direct proof that it corresponds to dimensional reduction away from the perturbative regime is hampered by the truncation used here , but we rely on the continuity argument within the @xmath3 plane to nonetheless identify it with an approximation of the dimensional reduction fixed point .",
    "breaking of dimensional reduction is thus associated with the appearance of a sufficiently strong nonanalyticity in the @xmath31-replica potential @xmath215 .",
    "analysis of the flow equation for @xmath215 ( see paper i ) shows that this corresponds to the following behavior as @xmath213 : @xmath216 , @xmath217 , @xmath218 , and @xmath219 ; @xmath220 and @xmath221 are analytic functions of their arguments in the vicinity of @xmath222 , @xmath74 ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath223 ) , and @xmath224 .",
