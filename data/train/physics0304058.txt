    "the compositional scheme of a bronze age sword , fig .",
    "1 , recently discovered near giurgiu , a town situated in the south of romania on the danube , has been studied using the method of particle - induced x ray emission ( pixe ) , at the tandem accelerator of national institute for physics and nuclear engineering from bucharest , magurele , romania . in order to have a comparative study of composition we have considered also the composition of 6 swords of the same type and from the same period from the south of danube in bulgaria , and some different copper - based alloy objects from plnaca deposit , in transylvania , dated also in the bronze age",
    "the sword has been discovered by ion cercel in 1981 in the mihai eminescu street of the city of giurgiu , romania , in the course of diggings related to the installation of underground electric cables . since then",
    "the sword has been kept by ion cercel , who presently is retired , in his house from the oinacu commune , district of giurgiu , in southern romania . in 1999 , by a happy concurrence of events , this interesting artifact became available to us , and we take this opportunity to thank ion cercel who has been kind to render us the sword for study and analyses .    according to the author of the finding , the artifact has been found at a depth of approximately 1.1 m , no other bronze objects existing in its vicinity .",
    "foundations of buildings from the late medieval period were known to exist in the area , but it seems that no such archaeological remains existed in the specific place where the sword has been found .",
    "it seems that the site where the sword has been discovered lies outside the medieval city , buildings being erected there only in the period after 1821 .",
    "the sword is in a good state of conservation , being preserved almost entirely , and has the following dimensions : total length 39.5 cm , width at base 5.3 cm , width at the tip 2.9 cm , thickness at base 0.9 cm , thickness toward the tip 0.6 cm , length of the hilt with missing terminal part 9 cm , length of the blade 30.5 cm . on the blade of the sword one can observe , on both faces , channels situated at approximately 0.4 cm from the two edges , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . the blade has a biconvex profile . in the zone of the hilt",
    "there are five orifices for the rivets of binding of the hilt and also three rivets still left in the orifices .",
    "it is possible that in the missing part of the hilt three more orifices should have existed for the binding of the hilt .",
    "the alloy is of a very good quality having a green - dark grey patina .",
    "the sword belongs to the reutlingen type defined by p. schauer @xcite and described , with a special view to artifacts attested on romanian territory , by t. bader .",
    "@xcite choosing as a criterion of classification in the first place the number of fixation orifices from the blade and the hilt , but also the shape of the nervure of the blade , the latter author distinguished several variants .",
    "@xcite due to the fact that the sword under consideration presents a large median nervure and which is slightly rounded , we think that it is most resembling to two fragmentary pieces belonging to the deposit of drajna de jos , district of prahova , romania , catalogued by t. bader with numbers 188 and 189 @xcite and included in the guteria variant of the reutlingen type .",
    "moreover , the giurgiu sword has much smaller dimensions , so that it could be rather considered a `` short sword '' ( kurzschwert ) .",
    "@xcite    artifacts of the reutlingen type have been discovered over a very large area from the south of scandinavia to peloponesos and from the rhine basin to the black sea , @xcite and recently discoveries have been reported even in anatolia .",
    "@xcite however , the spreading is not uniform , existing some regions of concentration and others represented by much fewer discoveries . among the latter ,",
    "one counts the extra - carpathian zone in romania and the territory of bulgaria and greece . @xcite",
    "it is however interesting that , in the balkan area , the discoveries are concentrated mainly in the southern part of romania , wallachia , and in the north of bulgaria , some of them just on the danube line .",
    "in addition to the two pieces from drajna de jos , on the romanian territory one finds specimens belonging to some variants in the ensemble of the reutlingen type : blceti and mateeti ( district of v^ alcea ) , techirghiol ( district of constana ) . on the territory of bulgaria",
    "there are 10 discoveries of swords with tongues at the hilt , of which 7 to the north and 3 to the south of the balkans .",
    "@xcite the 7 specimens discovered on the territory between the danube and the balkans arise from orjahovo ( orehovo ) , @xcite vrbica ( deposit ii ) , @xcite , bajkal , @xcite kruevo , @xcite balkanski @xcite and vasil levski , @xcite to which one adds the specimen of smaller dimensions from the razgrad museum ( inventory no .",
    "117 ) , discovered in the neighborhood .",
    "@xcite among these specimens the first two belong to the reutlingen type .",
    "the artifact from giurgiu has very close analogues ( except , of course , for the dimensions ) just in the sword from orjahovo and in the fragmentary artifact from vrbica , both cited as belonging to the guteria variant by t. bader .",
    "@xcite these two specimens have been ascribed in the early horizon of the culture of the fields of urns ( von brunn stages i - iii ) @xcite by b. h \" ansel , @xcite respectively in the subgroup i defined by i. panayotov ( the second horizon of deposits from bulgaria : xiii@xmath0 century b.c . ) .",
    "@xcite on the other hand , t. bader dates , as a function of the synchronisms revealed by the various deposits , the great majority of the specimens belonging to the reutlingen type discovered on the territory of romania in the cincu - suseni period ( haa1 , circa xii@xmath0 century b.c . ) , but ascribes three or four deposits ( among which is also the one from drajna",
    "de jos ) for the slightly earlier period uriu - domneti ( bronze d , circa xiii@xmath0 century b.c . )",
    "@xcite consequently , taking into account the analogies proposed by us with the specimens from drajna de jos , orjahovo and vrbica ii , we favor a dating of the short sword from giurgiu in the xiii@xmath0 century b.c . , probably towards the end of the century ; a date around 1200 b.c .",
    "is very likely .",
    "3 samples from the body of the sword : 1 sample from the tip of the sword and 2 samples from the hilt have been flatted and irradiated with protons of 3 mev , in a irradiation chamber at the fn tandem accelerator of national institute for physics and nuclear engineering from bucharest , magurele .    the beam current was kept below 10 na to maintain a count rate of about 250 counts / s , which implies negligible dead - time and pile - up corrections .",
    "x - rays were detected with a hpge ( 100 mm@xmath1 mm ) detector with 160 ev energy resolution at 5.9 kev .",
    "the x rays spectra have been recorded on a pc with a mca interface . in the frame of the experimental conditions",
    "the following elements have been observed : as , co , cr , cu , fe , ni , pb , sn and zn .    the x ray spectra have been processed off line and then the concentrations of the elements have been calculated .",
    "the results of pixe analysis on the samples from the sword from giurgiu are shown in the table 1 .",
    "the values of the concentrations are given in % .",
    "the instrumental errors are generally less than 15 % .",
    "we made corrections of the elemental concentrations so that the total value in the sample to be 100 % .",
    ".composition of the sword from giurgiu , by pixe [ cols=\"<,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 3 are shown the elemental composition for all considered objects : the giurgiu sword , the swords from bulgaria and different bronze objects from transylvanian deposit at plnaca",
    ". ratios of concentrations are considered for interpretation of the results to avoid the errors in the absolute calculations of the concentrations .",
    "it has been reported value zero in the cases the value of concentrations has been under the limit of detection .",
    "2 presents the diagram of ratios of concentrations : sn / cu versus as / sn for the analyzed samples in the present study , and also for bulgarian and transylvanian objects , analyzed by atomic spectroscopy and respectively neutron activation analysis .",
    "one could remark that the sword from giurgiu has a relative closer composition to the bulgarian ones , especially for the elements : as , cu , and sn .",
    "the objects from transylvania are situated relatively outside the cluster formed by the objects from giurgiu and bulgaria .",
    "we could express the idea of an association of the sword from giurgiu with the bulgarian swords , having a close composition and also similitude in typology , geographic area and dating .",
    "taking into account the analogies proposed by us with the bulgarian specimens , especially those of drajna de jos , orjahovo and vrbica ii , we favor a dating of the short sword from giurgiu in the xiii@xmath0 century b.c .",
