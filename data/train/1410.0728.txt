    "@xcite , the ones based on spin , atomic or even molecular ensembles coupled to superconducting microwave cavities have recently attracted much attention @xcite , see fig .",

    "the spin or atomic ensemble plays the role of a quantum memory , to which the quantum information is coherently stored and retrieved from at some later time .",
    "the cavity , in turn , serves as a quantum bus for the in- and output of information as well as for the coupling between several constituents of such hybrid quantum systems ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "one of the necessary conditions for the coherent transfer of quantum information between an ensemble and a cavity is the strong coupling between them .",
    "fortunately , various spin ensembles , as for instance , negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) defects in diamond @xcite , rare - earth spin ensembles @xcite , clouds of ultracold atoms @xcite or magnons in yttrium iron garnet with or without doping @xcite , may satisfy this requirement when being collectively coupled to @xcite .",
    "we also note that in recent proposals the direct coupling of a qubit to such spin - ensembles has been suggested without any cavity being involved @xcite .    here",
    "we study the dynamics of a superconducting cavity strongly coupled to an ensemble of negatively charged nv centers .",
    "each individual nv center can possess a sufficiently long coherence time @xcite needed for the coherent transfer of quantum information .",
    "however , since the local magnetic dipole - dipole couplings of nv centers constituting the ensemble to the bath of magnetic impurities ( such as nitrogen atoms not converted into nv centers ) slightly differ from each other , the nv electron spin resonance line of a large ensemble is inhomogeneously broadened @xcite .",
    "this line broadening acts as the main source of decoherence , and constitutes a significant drawback of this solid - state spin ensemble leading to a drastic decrease of its coherence time .",
    "several approaches including echo - type refocusing techniques @xcite have meanwhile been suggested to overcome this limitation .",
    "recent stationary transmission studies demonstrate that the decoherence can be strongly suppressed altogether @xcite when the spin density has a spectral distribution with tails that decay sufficiently fast @xcite . in this paper",
    "we report on a detailed time - dependent study for exactly such a case and demonstrate how the corresponding dynamics can be efficiently captured using a volterra integral equation for the cavity amplitude @xcite .",
    "the excellent correspondence between our theoretical model and a corresponding experiment allows us to closely look into the fascinating features following from a pulsed driving of this hybrid quantum system in the strong - coupling regime .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we present the theoretical framework of our problem and summarize the most important assumptions made .",
    "we sketch the general form of the equations obtained , describing the two methods for solving the volterra equation in appendices [ app_time_integr_volt_eq ] , [ app_lapl_transf ] .",
    "furthermore , we discuss the specific experimental realization of our theory . in section iii , we consider the dynamics under the action of a long rectangular microwave pulse which allows us to obtain the precise form for the spin density and its parameters by detailed comparison with the experimental results",
    ". we also present analytical results for a lorentzian spin density distribution and demonstrate which features are captured by this approximation and which are not .",
    "section iv will then address the question how the decoherence in our system caused by inhomogeneous broadening changes as a function of the coupling strength .",
    "we show that a non - lorentzian functional profile of the spin distribution leads to a strong suppression of decoherence for large values of the coupling strength ",
    "an effect known as `` cavity protection '' @xcite .",
    "finally , in section v , we propose a scheme which allows us to induce giant coherent oscillations between the cavity and our spin ensemble as well as to transfer energy into the spin ensemble very efficiently .",

    ", one can nevertheless reach the strong coupling regime due to the large number of spins which are collectively coupled to the cavity mode ( see e.g. @xcite for nv spin ensembles ) .",
    "the effect of collective coupling is particularly evident when reducing the interaction term to a collective term @xmath17 @xcite , where the collective spin operators are given by @xmath18 .",

    "the effective spin - waves that are excited by the cavity mode can be identified as superradiant collective dicke states which are effectively damped by the coupling to subradiant states in the ensemble @xcite .",

    "the corresponding experiment is carried out in a standard dilution refrigerator with a synthetic diamond placed on top of a resonator cooled to millikelvin temperatures ( @xmath33mk ) ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "the concentration of nv centers in diamond is sufficiently low and the distance between spins is still large enough , so that the dipole - dipole interactions between spins is negligibly small justifying the assumption of our model . by applying an external magnetic field ,",
    "two degenerate sub - ensembles , which can effectively be considered as a single sub - ensemble , are brought into resonance with the cavity , whereas the other sub - ensembles make a slight dispersive contribution only and their influence is neglected here ( see e.g. @xcite for more details ) . the individual spins are distributed around the mean frequency @xmath34ghz , with the width @xmath35 , which is of the order of @xmath36mhz .",
    "the coupling strength of each individual spin with a cavity mode is typically of the order of @xmath37hz @xcite .",
    "however , the effective coupling @xmath21 is enhanced by a factor of @xmath20 with the ensemble size @xmath38 , so that @xmath21 can reach values as large as @xmath36mhz which is sufficient to reach the strong coupling regime .",
    "note that the energy of thermal photons is substantially smaller than that of microwave photons , @xmath25 , resulting in an occupation probability of the ensemble in the ground state which is larger than @xmath39 . in what follows ,",
    "the cavity frequency was taken to be always equal to the spin mean frequency , @xmath40ghz .",
