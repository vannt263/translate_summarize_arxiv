    "one of the major thrusts of nuclear physics in the next decade will be the effort to study the quark - gluon plasma . at the high temperatures reached",
    ", one can consider applying dimensional reduction . to test the accuracy of dimensional reduction",
    ", a purely gluonic system provides a simple , but relevant benchmark .",
    "therefore , here we study @xmath2 gauge theory at finite temperature .",
    "up to now , only gauge invariant correlation functions of colourless states have been measured .",
    "this approach gives no information about the effective action .",
    "here , we measure directly the effective coupling constants .",
    "the analytics of dimensional reduction gives us perturbative expressions for these coupling constants .",
    "a numerical , non - perturbative determination allows us to monitor the two ways in which the perturbative calculation can fail : @xmath4 as the temperature is lowered , the couplings increasingly depart from their perturbative values .",
    "@xmath5 the effective action becomes less local - couplings of higher - dimension operators , e.g. @xmath6 , completely neglected in the perturbative approach , become sizeable .",
    "+ the non - perturbatively determined coupling constants allow us , with certainty in principle , to extend the validity of dimensional reduction below temperatures achieved perturbatively . in that sense , we attempt a non - perturbative improvement of the dimensionally reduced action .",
    "the leading infrared behavior of @xmath7-@xmath2 gauge theory at high temperatures is governed by its static ( zero matsubara frequency ) sector , obtained by integrating out its non - static modes to leave behind an effective three - dimensional theory .",
    "the non - static modes are suppressed in the infrared . at high temperature ,",
    "@xmath8 becomes small due to asymptotic freedom .",
    "a perturbative treatment of the non - static modes is justified .",
    "this is called dimensional reduction .",
    "+ the euclidean action is @xmath9 expanding the @xmath10-fields into fourier series in the temporal direction , keeping only the static modes and integrating out all the others , we end up with a @xmath11-@xmath2 gauge theory minimally coupled to a self - interacting adjoint scalar field @xcite : @xmath12[{d}_j,{a}_{0,0}^a ] \\notag \\\\ & + m_d^2 \\mathrm{tr } ( { a}_{0,0}^a)^2 + \\lambda_a ( \\mathrm{tr } ( { a}_{0,0}^a)^2)^2 \\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term is the @xmath11-@xmath2 gauge theory and the second term is the kinetic term of the static adjoint higgs field @xmath13 .",
    "the coefficients of this @xmath11 effective action , the gauge coupling @xmath14 , the debye mass @xmath15 and the quartic coupling @xmath16 , can be determined from the perturbative expansion , or numerically as follows .",
    "any action can be parameterized by @xmath17 where @xmath18 s are interaction terms , and the @xmath19 s are unknown effective coupling constants .",
    "the lattice action corresponding to the continuum theory ( [ eq:@xmath11action ] ) is after some reformulation @xcite : @xmath20 \\notag \\\\   & + \\beta_a \\sum_{x , i } \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr }",
    "\\tilde{a}_0(x ) u_i(x ) \\tilde{a}_0(x+\\hat{i } ) u_i^\\dagger(x ) \\notag \\\\ & + \\sum_{x}\\left[-\\beta_2 \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\tilde{a}_0 ^ 2 + \\beta_4 ( \\frac{1}{2}\\mathrm{tr}\\tilde{a}_0 ^ 2)^2 \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the lattice spacing , @xmath22 , @xmath23\\beta_a$ ] and @xmath24 .",
    "@xmath25 is arbitrary under a rescaling of @xmath26 .",
    "in addition we introduce an auxiliary system , called demon system , given by the action @xmath27 here the @xmath19 s are the same as in @xmath28 , and the @xmath29 s are the `` demon energies '' , constrained to lie in the interval @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "the total partition function factorizes into the one of the original system and that of the single demons .",
    "we can compute the distribution of each demon energy @xmath29 .",
    "solving this equation with respect to @xmath19 allows us to determine the effective coupling constants : @xmath31 we follow closely the method of @xcite .",
    "first , we generate a statistically independent configuration c with a canonical update of the @xmath7-@xmath2-system only . on this given configuration c",
    ", we perform one microcanonical update of the ( @xmath7-@xmath2+demon)-system , as follows : the change of a link , under multiplication by a randomly generated matrix close to the identity , causes a shift of the effective energy of the lattice , @xmath32 , which must be compensated with the demon energies @xmath29 .",
    "the trial is accepted if all the new demon energies remain in the allowed region .",
    "after visiting all links , the demons `` move '' to another gauge configuration c while keeping their energies . because our ansatz for the @xmath11-reduced action is correct in the presence of small fluctuations only ,",
    "we restrict the microcanonical update to a small step size , and perform only one microcanonical sweep on each gauge configuration .",
    "the @xmath33 are related to the physical coupling constants @xmath34,@xmath35 and @xmath36 , as defined after ( [ latticeaction ] ) .",
    "for @xmath35 we must add counterterms , calculated in @xcite , to remove uv - divergencies and compare with continuum @xmath37-scheme theoretical calculations .",
    "we measure the effective couplings as a function of temperature @xmath38 . to monitor effects of the lattice discretization",
    ", we study , at each temperature , several systems of identical physical size and increasingly fine lattice spacing ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 ) .      as shown in fig .  1",
    ", we observe a clear , large disagreement between the measurements and the perturbative prediction .",
    "the measured values of the coupling appear to depend only mildly on the lattice spacing .",
    "unfortunately , the disagreement with the perturbative prediction worsens as the continuum limit is approached .",
    "the origin of the problem , we believe , lies in our lattice - based approach .",
    "the perturbative calculation is performed in the continuum theory , and the green s functions are computed for small spatial momenta @xmath42 . in contrast , the spatial momenta on our lattices are cut - off by the lattice spacing , not by the temperature . as we reduce the lattice spacing to approach the continuum limit , we allow for larger momenta and depart more and more from the infrared , perturbative result .    as a first attempt to mimic the effect of our lattice approach",
    ", we tried to replace @xmath43 in the continuum perturbative predictions .",
    "as shown in fig .  1 , a factor @xmath44 is necessary to reach reasonable agreement with our data , to be compared with the value @xmath45 relating the @xmath37 and the lattice renormalization schemes @xcite . in figs.2 and 3 , the dashed line shows the effect of this rescaling @xmath46 on the other couplings .",

    "@xmath47 vs @xmath38 .",
    "measurements and perturbative predictions ( solid line ) clearly disagree .",
    "rescaling @xmath48 by a factor 300 restores agreement ( dashed line ) .",
    "@xmath35 stays somewhat below the theoretical predictions for all temperatures studied ( up to @xmath49 ) .",
    "because the debye mass is only obtained after subtraction of uv - divergent counterterms , statistical errors quickly increase as the continuum limit is approached .",
    "there is a tendency for better agreement with perturbation theory at smaller @xmath21 .",
    "as explained above , agreement should not be expected anyway since we keep larger spatial momenta than in the continuum approach .",
    "nevertheless , the disagreement for @xmath50 is much smaller than for @xmath51 , and could be accounted for by a milder rescaling of the @xmath52 parameter .",
    "= 5.5 cm    figure 2 .",
    "@xmath53 vs @xmath38 .      like the other couplings",

    "@xmath54 vs @xmath38 .",
    "in perturbative dimensional reduction , one considers only two and four - point functions , to one- or at most two - loop level @xcite , and neglects higher - dimension operators .",
    "then , dimensional reduction appears to be valid down to @xmath55 @xcite .",
    "numerically determined effective coupling constants allow a non - perturbative improvement of the theory .",
    "higher - dimension operators , with couplings determined by additional demons , are easily included .",
    "we have added an @xmath6-term in the effective action , but the effect on the other couplings is small . our results still disagree with continuum perturbative predictions even at @xmath49 .",
    "we intend to compare them with the perturbative results of @xcite , obtained directly on the lattice .",
