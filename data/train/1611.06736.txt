    "nonclassical states , are the quantum states of light for which the glauber - sudarshan p distribution @xcite associated with the density operator @xmath0 , @xmath1 fails to be a true probability distribution @xcite ; where @xmath2 stands for coherent state .",

    "etc_. it is worth noting that a quantitative aspect of these studies @xcite is that the bs output entanglement grows monotonically with the input * nc*. nonetheless , there exists a broader class of optical states @xcite that are generated under successive action of the two different types of * nc*-inducing operations , _ viz .",

    "these states exhibit many intriguing nonclassical effects @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "their two - mode versions are found more entangled than the epr state @xmath3 @xcite as well as improving the efficiency of teleporting coherent states @xcite ; @xmath4 being the two mode correlated squeezing operator .",
    "however , the bs generated entanglement from such single mode states remains unexplored .",
    "consequently , it becomes imperative to analyze the bs generated entanglement from such single mode states of light with coexisting multiple different * nc*-inducing operations in the context of quantum information processing tasks with optical resources @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study the quantitative aspects of bs generated entanglement from input single mode photon added squeezed vacuum state ( pasvs ) @xcite and squeezed number state ( sns ) @xcite .",
    "we find that the bs output entanglement , from input sns , depends monotonically on number of photon excitation and quadrature squeezing . on the other hand , for input pasvs",
    ", we observe a non - monotonic dependence on both of them . to understand the specific behavior of entanglement at the bs output",
    ", we analyze the input * nc * in terms of well known measures such as nonclassical depth , hilbert - schmidt distance from nearest coherent state as well as negativity of wigner distribution .",
    "our analytical and numerical results show that none of these measures characterize the nonclassical aspects of pasvs and sns properly to account for corresponding bs output entanglement .",
    "further , to explain this counter - intuitive result , we introduce the concept of competition between the * nc*-inducing operations manifest in terms of q function contours .",

    "ii , we briefly review the known results on bs output entanglement from input states generated by single * nc*-inducing operations , viz . , photon addition and quadrature squeezing . in section ii , in contrast to the cases of section iii , we present the dependence of bs entanglement from input states with both the * nc*-inducing operations , in particular , sns and pasvs . in section iv",
    ", we present a quantitative study of effective * nc * of pasvs and sns in terms of nonclassical depth , negativity of wigner distribution as well as hilbert - schmidt distance from nearest classical state . in section",
    "v , we propose a picture of these states in terms of contours of husimi - kano q function .",
    "we explain the dependence of bs output entanglement on @xmath5 and @xmath6 as arising from the competition between the two different * nc*-inducing operations that generate the states .",
    "in this section we focus on the bs generated entanglement from squeezed vacuum state and the photon number state .",
    "these states can be viewed as being generated from vacuum state under the action of a single nc - inducing operations such as ( i ) quadrature squeezing implemented by the squeezing operation @xmath7 and ( ii ) photon excitation given by @xmath8 . in the squeezed vacuum state ,",
    "@xmath9 , the variance in the quadrature variable @xmath10 , @xmath11 , is given by @xmath12 .",
    "hence @xmath6 can be taken to be a measure of squeezing in the state @xmath9 .",
    "it may be noted that @xmath13 ( i.e. @xmath14 ) implies the state @xmath9 is nonclassical in the sense that the glauber - sudarshan p distribution corresponding to the state is not a true probability distribution . in view of the fact that as @xmath6 becomes larger and larger , @xmath15 becomes smaller and smaller compared to @xmath16 , it may be argued that higher the value of squeezing strength @xmath6 , more nonclassical the state @xmath9 is . in the same way ,",
    "the photon number state @xmath17 is a nonclassical state .",
    "again it is easily argued that the state @xmath18 becomes more nonclassical as @xmath5 increases as is well known , the glauber - sudarshan p distribution becomes more and more singular compared to the delta function @xcite .",
    "thus , we see that atleast as far as the action on the vacuum state is concerned , the two nc - inducing operations @xmath19 and @xmath8 are nc-_increasing _ as well .",
    "recently , s. rahimi - keshari _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have described the * nc * of any quantum process as whether it induces nonclassical effects on any coherent state @xmath20 which is a classical state .",
    "our notion of * nc*-_increasing _ operation perfectly corroborates with their definition since the vacuum state can be looked as a special case of @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) .    in this background",
    ", we now visit the question of how the bs output entanglement @xmath22 varies with input * nc * when squeezed vacuum state @xmath9 or photon number state @xmath18 is input at one port of the bs with vacuum @xmath23 at the other .",
    "a passive ( lossless ) 50:50 bs is represented by the transformation matrix @xmath24 [ moderel ]    between the input and output modes . for a single mode number state as input",
    "bs output state @xcite becomes , @xmath25    for any bi - partite pure entangled state @xmath26 , entanglement is measured by the local von - neumann entropy @xcite @xmath27 , \\label{entdef}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 $ ] .",
    "bs generated entanglement from input state @xmath29 is , thus , obtained by replacing @xmath26 by @xmath30 .    using relation ( [ entdef ] ) , it is easy to show that @xmath31 } \\label{entfock}\\ ] ] while the e@xmath32 for squeezed vacuum state is calculated numerically .",
    "we have evaluated the bs generated entanglement for input number state [ fig .",
    "1(a ) ] and squeezed vacuum state [ fig .",
    "clearly , the @xmath22 increases monotonically as @xmath6 or @xmath5 respectively is increased .",
    "these results reinforce the argument made above that * nc * of @xmath9 or @xmath18 increases with @xmath6 or m respectively because * nc * of the input is a resource from which one has extracted entanglement in the bs setting , as is considered by j. k. asboth _",
    "let s now consider successive action of two different nc - inducing operations , _ viz_. , quadrature squeezing and photon addition on an initial vacuum state .",
    "this leads to sns @xcite and pasvs @xcite given by , @xmath33 where @xmath34 @xmath35 order legendre polynomial and @xmath36 are given in @xcite .",
    "we now turn to the question of quantitative aspects of bs output entanglement when either sns or pasvs is input at one of the ports of the bs .",
    "using relation @xmath37 we get the bs output states for input sns and pasvs as , @xmath38    in fig .",
    "2(a ) , we have plotted the entanglement entropy of the bs output state @xmath39 when sns is input , as a function of @xmath6 for various values @xmath5 .",
    "one can see from the figure that entanglement increases monotonically with both @xmath6 as well as @xmath5 .",
    "this monotonic dependence is quite similar to what one had when either a squeezed vacuum state or a photon number state as input as discussed in section ii . in contrast , the bs output entanglement with pasvs as input [ fig .",
    "2(b ) ] shows ( except in the case of @xmath40 ) a _ non - monotonic _ dependence on both @xmath6 and @xmath5 . for a fixed value of @xmath5 ( @xmath41 ) , the bs output entanglement first decreases and then increases . for sufficiently large @xmath6 in fact",
    "@xmath42 is almost independent of the photon addition number @xmath5 .     for *",
    "a * : pasvs , * b * : sns ] with @xmath6 for @xmath40 ( black , solid line ) , 2 ( brown , dashed line ) , 3 ( green , dotted line ) , 4 ( blue , dashed - dotted line ) and 5 ( red , dashed - double dotted line ) . ]    from comparison of the results in the cases of sns and pasvs , it is evident that the dependence of bs output on @xmath6 and @xmath5 depends critically on the order of in which the squeezing [ @xmath19 ] and the photon addition [ @xmath8 ] operations act on the initial vacuum state .",
    "this non - monotonic dependence in the case of pasvs is indeed counter - intuitive given that ( as we have noted in section ii ) , bs input states generated under a single nc - inducing operation lead to monotonically increasing bs output entanglement .",
    "in a first attempt to resolve this non - monotonic dependence mentioned above , we argue that for states generated under multiple nc - inducing operations , sns and pasvs in particular , @xmath6 and @xmath5 individually may not measure nonclassicality of these states , but one should perhaps work with an effective measure .",
    "several nonclassicality measures have been proposed in the literature such as nonclassical depth @xcite , wigner negativity @xcite and one based on the hilbert - schmidt distance @xcite . in this section",
    "we shall investigate if any of these measures faithfully capture the * nc * of these states , and if they do , working with such effective measures allows us to understand this non - monotonic dependence .",
    "nonclassical depth of any quantum state of light is defined as the minimal smoothing needed to wash out the negativity ( and singularity ) of p distribution . from p distribution",
    "one can define a general @xmath45 convoluted distribution , @xmath46 .",
    "the nonclassical depth , @xmath47 , is defined as the minimum value of @xmath45 needed to make @xmath48 positive semi - definite regular function @xcite .",
    "the function @xmath48 for pasvs and sns ( appendix a ) are given as , @xmath49 where @xmath50}{\\eta^{2}-\\tau^{2}(1-\\eta)^{2 } } \\big ) , \\nonumber \\\\ & a_{1}=\\frac{\\tau(1-\\eta)^{2}}{2[\\eta^{2}-\\tau^{2}(1-\\eta)^{2}]}~,~a_{2}=\\frac{a_{1}}{\\mu^{2}}-\\frac{\\tau}{2 } , \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath51 and @xmath52 and @xmath53 is the @xmath54 order laguerre polynomial .    because of the presence of laguerre polynomial ( _ eqn .",
    "_ [ ncdepth ] ) , positiveness of the function @xmath48 is not guaranteed for all choices of @xmath45 . in such cases , as prescribed in @xcite , the nonclassical depth has to be taken to be unity .",
    "thus we have a situation where nonclassical depth for both @xmath55 and @xmath56 is the same as the photon number state , and hence it is independent of the squeezing strength @xmath6 .",
    "clearly , therefore , nonclassical depth fails to be a faithful measure of nc as far as these states are concerned .",
    "further , our conclusion , specifically in the context of these states , is in conformity with the general conclusion that nonclassical depth is always unity for all non - gaussian pure states @xcite .",
    "it is well known that wigner function @xmath57 of any state of light @xmath0 , being negative in phase - space , indicates that the state @xmath0 is nonclassical .",
    "this criterion of course fails for gaussian states .",
    "phase space integral of the negative part of the wigner function , the wigner negativity @xmath58 may be considered as a measure of nc @xcite .",
    "a larger @xmath59 implies that the state is more nonclassical .",
    "the wigner functions of pasvs and sns ( appendix b ) are given by , @xmath60 where @xmath61 .",
    "with @xmath6 for @xmath5=1 ( black , solid line ) , 2 ( brown , dashed line ) , 3 ( green , dotted line ) , 4 ( blue , dashed - dotted line ) and 5 ( red , dashed - double dotted line ) for pasvs . ]    in fig .",
    "3 , the wigner negativity of pasvs is plotted as a function of the squeezing strength @xmath6 for various values of the photon addition number @xmath5 . for all values of @xmath5 ,",
    "the wigner negativity falls off with increasing r. this can be understood as being due to photon addition operation for large @xmath6 . in the case of sns",
    ", however , wigner negativity is independent of @xmath6 and hence it is the same as that of the number state @xmath18 .",
    "the independence of wigner negativity on @xmath6 , in case of sns , can be easily understood from the following fact .",
    "if @xmath62 is the wigner function of a given state @xmath0 , then the wigner function of the state @xmath63 is @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 are related to each other by a linear canonical transformation .",
    "since the jacobian of any linear canonical transformation is unity , the wigner negativity of @xmath67 are the same .    as in the case of nonclassical depth",
    ", again we have a situation where wigner function negativity fails to be a faithful measure of * nc * as far as sns is concerned . as our aim is to do a comparative study of pasvs and sns in the context of entanglement of bs output state with these states as input",
    ", it is desirable that we have a measure of * nc * that works equally well for both the * nc*-inducing operations , i.e. photon excitation and quadrature squeezing .",
    "a measure of nc based on the hilbert - schmidt distance between density operators has been proposed in the literature @xcite . this measure is defined as the hilbert - schmidt distance of a given density operator @xmath0 from the nearest classical state . since coherent states @xmath20 are the only pure classical states @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath68 for a pure state @xmath69 is defined as , @xmath70^{1/2}.\\ ] ] where infimum is taken over set of all coherent states @xmath20 ; @xmath71 being a complex number .",

    "4(a ) and fig .",
    "4(b ) we have plotted @xmath68 for pasvs and sns . as is evident from the figures @xmath68 ( unlike nonclassical depth and wigner negativity ) shows non - trivial dependence on @xmath5 and @xmath6 in the case of both the states .",
    "in fact , @xmath68 for both these states exhibits non - monotonic dependence on @xmath6 and @xmath5 . however , a comparison of figs .",
    "3(a ) with figs .",
    "2(a ) in the case of pasvs suggests that even for @xmath40 while * nc * as measured by @xmath68 _ decreases _ for small @xmath6 bs output entanglement _ increases_. in the case of sns as well , while the dependence of @xmath68 on @xmath6 for various @xmath5 is non - monotonic , the dependence of bs output entanglement is strictly monotonic . in both cases we have unphysical results .",
    "this leads us to the conclusion that @xmath68 too is not an acceptable measure of * nc * of states generated under multiple * nc*-inducing operations , in particular sns and pasvs .     for * a * : pasvs , * b * : sns with @xmath6 for",
    "@xmath5=1 ( black , solid line ) , 2 ( brown , dashed line ) , 3 ( green , dotted line ) , 4 ( blue , dashed - dotted line ) and 5 ( red , dashed - double dotted line ) ]    .",
    "it appears from the above discussion that none of the three measures considered above is an acceptable measure of * nc * of such states .",
    "whether it is possible to construct another measure for such states that shows a dependence on @xmath6 and @xmath5 that is consistent with the dependence of bs output entanglement on these parameters remains an open question .",
    "in this section we shall attempt to understand the monotonic dependence ( in sns ) of bs output entanglement as opposed to the non - monotonic dependence ( in the case of pasvs ) in terms of a competition between two different kinds of * nc*-inducing operations underlying these states .    to begin with , it is helpful to visualize the effect of the two * nc*-inducing operations acting individually on an initial vacuum state in terms of the deformation induced in the circular @xmath74 function contour of the vacuum state . as is well - known light ( initially in a coherent state ) propagating through a medium with a kerr nonlinearity undergoes radial squeezing @xcite , and hence the photon number state can be thought of as an extreme case of a radially squeezed state .",
    "thus , figuratively speaking , the photon excitation ( addition ) operation [ @xmath75 can be thought of as deforming the circular @xmath74 function contour of the vacuum state into an extreme crescent shape . on the other hand ,",
    "the squeezing operation [ @xmath19 ] can be thought of as deforming the initial circular @xmath74 function contour of the vacuum state into an ellipse @xcite .",
    "the above picture can now be applied to states with two * nc*-inducing operations applied in succession . in the case of pasvs , we plot the contour of q function in fig .",
    "5 . for small @xmath6 ( @xmath76 )",
    ", with increase in @xmath5 ( a1-a2-a3-a4-a5 ) q distribution contours of initial squeezed vacuum state become more of crescent shape showing the dominance of photonic character .",

    "we also note that , for all @xmath5 values , the crescent shape gets smoothed out with increase in @xmath6 revealing the dominant squeezing character in the state .",
    "evidently , with increase in @xmath6 , pasvs undergoes a characteristic crossover , from photonic to quadrature squeezed one .",
    "such characteristic crossover , in the context of competition between photon addition and quadrature squeezing , further explains the specific dependence of e@xmath99 on @xmath5 at fixed @xmath6 .",

    "we find , for pasvs , @xmath102 is the parameter region where the effect of competition between elliptic and radial squeezing dominates .",
    "it is this effect of competition therefore which can be argued as contributing to the non - monotonic dependence in the bs output entanglement as can be seen from fig .",

    "quadrature squeezing induces elliptic squeezing on the already extreme crescent shape of the @xmath74 function contour of the initial photon number state . as is shown in fig .",
