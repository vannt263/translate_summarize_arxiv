    "the discrete painlev equations , together with the painlev equations , are now widely recognized as one of the most important families of the integrable systems ( see , for example , @xcite ) . originally , the discrete painlev equations were discovered in the form of single second - order difference equations and identified as the discrete analogues of the painlev equations@xcite .",
    "then they were generalized to simultaneous first - order equations by a singularity confinement criterion@xcite .",
    "a typical example is the following equation known as a discrete painlev ii equation@xcite : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the dependent variable , @xmath5 is the independent variable , and @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 @xmath9 are parameters .",
    "we note that was found as the equation satisfied by the constant terms of the orthogonal polynomials on the unit circle@xcite . by applying the singularity confinement criterion ,",
    "is generalized to @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a parameter , with its integrability preserved . introducing the dependent variables @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 by @xmath14 then can be rewritten as @xmath15 equation is known as a discrete painlev iii equation since it admits a continuous limit to the painlev iii equation@xcite .",
    "conversely , can be recovered from by putting @xmath16 and .",
    "this procedure is referred to as `` _ symmetrization _ '' of , which comes from the terminology of the quispel ",
    "roberts  thompson ( qrt ) mapping@xcite .",
    "after this terminology , is sometimes called the `` _ asymmetric _ '' discrete painlev ii equation , and is called the `` _ symmetric _ '' discrete painlev iii equation@xcite .    it appears as though the symmetrization is a simple specialization on the level of the equation , but the following problems were known : ( i ) according to sakai s theory@xcite , the painlev and discrete painlev equations are classified by the underlying space of initial conditions . moreover , the discrete painlev equations arise as the birational mappings corresponding to the translations of the affine weyl groups associated with the space of initial conditions .",
    "the asymmetric discrete painlev equations are characterized in this manner , however , it was not known how to characterize the symmetric equations as the action of affine weyl groups .",
    "( ii ) the painlev and discrete painlev equations admit the particular solutions expressible in terms of the hypergometric type functions ( hypergeometric solutions ) when some of the parameters take special values ( see , for example , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , the hypergeometric solutions to the symmetric discrete painlev equation can not be obtained by the nave specialization of those to the corresponding asymmetric equation .",
    "for example , has the hypergeometric solution expressible in terms of the parabolic cylinder function ( weber function ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "admits the hypergeometric solution in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function@xcite .",
    "the crucial point is that although the former function is expressed as a specialization of the latter , this specialization is not consistent with the symmetrization .    in @xcite ,",
    "the mechanism of the symmetrization was investigated in detail by taking an example of @xmath0-painlev equation with the affine weyl group symmetry of type @xmath17 .",
    "then it was shown that in general , various discrete dynamical systems of painlev type can be obtained from elements of infinite order that are not necessarily translations in the affine weyl group by taking the projection on appropriate subspaces of the parameter spaces .",
    "such a procedure is called a _ projective reduction _ , and the symmetrization can be understood as a kind of projective reduction .",
    "moreover , the above nontrivial inconsistency among the hypergeometric solutions are explained by the factorization of the linear difference operators associated with the three - term relation of the hypergeometric functions .    in spite of understanding the mechanism of the symmetrization or the projective reduction , it is still nontrivial what function will appear in the hypergeometric solutions to the symmetric discrete painlev equations even if the hypergeometric solutions to the corresponding asymmetric equations are known . since the continuous limit of the symmetric discrete painlev equation is different from the corresponding asymmetric one , it is also important to consider the continuous limit of the symmetric discrete painlev equations together with their hypergeometric solutions .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to construct the simplest hypergeometric solutions to each of the symmetric @xmath0-painlev equations . in @xcite",
    "the simplest hypergeometric solutions to all possible @xmath0-painlev equations in sakai s list have been constructed .",
    "similarly , in this paper , we present the list of the simplest hypergeometric solutions to the symmetric @xmath0-painlev equations reduced from the asymmetric ones with the affine weyl group symmetry of type @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath17 .",
    "we also aim to consider the continuous limits of those symmetric @xmath0-painlev equations to the painlev equations , together with their hypergeometric solutions .",
