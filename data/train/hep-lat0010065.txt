    "recent proposals for symanzik improvement of the staggered fermion action have produced encouraging results , particularly in an improved flavor and rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "adding a few terms to the conventional kogut - susskind action , namely three - link , five - link and seven - link staples and a third - neighbor coupling , removes all tree - level @xmath1 errors @xcite .",
    "the computational price for using this action is quark mass dependent , and is roughly a factor of 2.5 for the lightest masses we are using .",
    "here we extend previous work with our preferred `` asqtad '' action , studying scaling in the quenched approximation , and exploring the effects of dynamical quarks on the light hadron spectrum and the heavy - quark potential .",
    "we have accumulated a library of gauge configurations , both quenched ( one - loop symanzik improved gauge action ) and dynamical .",
    "our    [ cols=\"<,<,^,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     @xmath2 sample is currently being enlarged .",
    "dynamical fermion lattices are generated in the presence of two lighter flavors ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) and one heavier flavor ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "for the dynamical fermion sample the gauge coupling is tuned so that the lattice spacing remains the same as the quark mass is varied , allowing an exploration of quark mass effects independent of scale .",
    "the current parameter set is shown in the table above .",
    "to measure the degree of residual flavor symmetry breaking , we compute the mass of the local non - goldstone pion ( @xmath6 ) as a function of lattice spacing at a fixed value of the goldstone pion mass ( @xmath7 ) on a series of quenched lattices @xcite . in particular , we fix @xmath8 ( goldstone @xmath9 ) with the scale @xmath10 set by the force @xmath11 between static quarks @xmath12 , a variant of sommer s scale@xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath13 depends on the quark masses , varying from 1.376(2 ) for the quenched theory to 1.44(1 ) for physical quark masses .",
    "the effect of improving the fermion action is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pi05_vs_m_2 ] .",
    "it is expected that the curves for all actions extrapolate to the goldstone pion mass .",
    "scaling of the @xmath14 and nucleon masses is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : nuc_vs_m_2 ] and [ fig : rho_vs_m_2 ] . results for variants of the wilson - clover action are also shown @xcite .",
    "for these masses , the asqtad action gives the best result .",
    "nonetheless , it is encouraging that staggered fermion and wilson - clover simulations agree in the continuum limit .",
    "to determine the effect of dynamical quarks on the light hadron spectrum , we ran a series of quenched and @xmath15 dynamical fermion simulations with gauge couplings tuned to fix the lattice spacing @xmath16 fm , using @xmath17 lattices for both the quenched and dynamical runs .",
    "the plotted points are from the runs described in table i with light quark masses down to @xmath18 and from the quenched run at @xmath19 . the resulting edinburgh plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : edin_both ] shows no discernible change when dynamical quarks are introduced .",
    "this @xmath15 flavor @xmath0 fm result appears to be in conflict with our previous claims , based on the conventional action with two sea quark flavors in the @xmath20 limit @xcite .",
    "we are currently investigating whether the difference comes from the number of flavors , the continuum extrapolation , or some other source of systematic error .",
    "dynamical quark loops modify the heavy quark potential @xcite , _ e.g. _ , by opening the two - meson decay channel and by altering the running of the coulomb coupling . in fig .",
    "[ fig : potmatch_phys.b800b685l20 ] we plot the heavy quark potential with and without @xmath21 flavors of sea quarks of mass @xmath22 .",
    "the vertical scale is adjusted to give agreement at @xmath10 , and since the force at @xmath10 is used to set the scale , the two potentials have the same slope there .    to the extent the potential changes shape under the influence of sea quarks , setting the lattice scale from the heavy quark potential clearly has limitations .",
    "this point is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : r1_sq_sigma ] , where we plot the ratio of two possible heavy - quark - potential - inspired scales as a function of the ratio of the pion to rho mass .",
    "as the pion mass drops to zero with decreasing quark mass , one expects to see evidence for the decay of heavier mesons , such as @xmath23 and @xmath24 .",
    "the mixing between a resonant state and a two - meson decay state should result in avoided level crossing in the spectrum of the resonant state .",
    "while such decays are natural when dynamical quarks are present , quenched simulations may also show hints of decay in some cases , through `` hairpin '' diagrams , although at different rates .",
    "previous attempts to observe effects of meson decay in the @xmath14 spectrum were unsuccessful @xcite . here",
    "we report results of a preliminary attempt to observe effects of the decay @xmath25 .",
    "this threshold is easier to approach than the @xmath26 threshold because the final pseudoscalars do nt have to carry away angular momentum , so they can both be at zero momentum .",
    "however , it is difficult , because with staggered quarks the @xmath27 appears in the same propagators as the pions , so we must extract the alternating exponential from a propagator containing a much larger simple exponential .",
    "we measure the @xmath27 mass ( _ i.e. _ lowest energy in the @xmath27 ( @xmath28 ) channel ) as a function of quark mass .",
    "this is done on quenched and dynamical fermion configurations .",
    "preliminary results , shown in fig .  [ fig : a0_decay_clean ] , suggest that the lowest @xmath28 mass drops more rapidly with decreasing quark mass in the dynamical fermion simulation .",
    "the drop appears to follow the threshold energy of the decay channel , also shown .",
    "such a result would be expected from avoided level crossing .",
    "in fact , for the lighter quark masses it is very difficult to extract masses for the quenched @xmath27 .",
    "this may be a signal of the non - unitarized ( because of the quenching ) couplings to two particle states .",
    "we continue studies using a recently proposed improved staggered fermion action .",
    "we find that the light hadron spectrum in our currently preferred asqtad action scales very well .",
    "we have begun a systematic study of quark loop effects with @xmath15 flavors .",
    "our present sample of gauge configurations has been constructed so that the lattice spacing is kept constant as the quark masses are varied .",
    "we see no quark loop effects in the light hadron spectrum with @xmath15 flavors at a lattice spacing of @xmath0 fm . however , sea quarks evidently modify the heavy quark potential both at short and long distance , suggesting caution in using this potential to set a precision lattice scale at unphysical quark masses .",
    "preliminary determinations of the mass of the @xmath27 as a function of quark mass suggest evidence for the decay to @xmath29 .",
