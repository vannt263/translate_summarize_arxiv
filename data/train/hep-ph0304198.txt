    "the third type of ratio - relations , holding for all @xmath103 values , follows by determining the effective mass scale , @xmath10 , so that there is an exact equality for the ratio of left - handed amplitudes ( iii ) : @xmath104 equivalently , @xmath105 = e_w/2 $ ] follows from each of : @xmath106 @xmath107 @xmath108 from the amplitude expressions given above , the value of this scale @xmath10 can be characterized by postulating the existence of a twb - transformation @xmath76 @xmath2 where @xmath77 @xmath78 , with @xmath109 $ ] and analogously for @xmath110 .    assuming ( iii ) , the fourth type of relation is the equality ( iv ) : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
