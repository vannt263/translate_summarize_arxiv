    "the boundary terms @xmath6 and @xmath7 are to be set equal to 0 . the solutions to ( [ 1 ] ) define a reversible diffusion process in @xmath8 with respect to the stationary measure @xmath9 particle @xmath10 interacts with both , right and left , neighboring particles with labels @xmath11 and @xmath12 .    in our contribution we will study the case where the interaction is only with the right neighbor",
    "hence , including an adjustment of the noise strength , @xmath13 @xmath2 .",
    "somewhat unexpectedly , the measure ( [ 2 ] ) is still stationary . of course , now the diffusion process is no longer reversible .",
    "as to be discussed this modification will change dramatically the large scale properties of the dynamics .",

    "hence the diffusion process @xmath17 has the weyl chamber @xmath18 as state space . away from @xmath19 , @xmath17 is simply @xmath5-dimensional brownian motion .",

    "even stronger , the process @xmath23 has the same law as the top line of @xmath5-particle dyson s brownian motion starting at @xmath24  @xcite .",
    "it then follows that @xmath25 here @xmath26 denotes integer part .",
    "the coefficients @xmath27 depend on @xmath28 , and @xmath29 is a tracy  widom distributed random variable .",
    "one can also consider the particle label @xmath30 . then in ( [ 4 ] ) one has a stochastic process in @xmath31 and it converges to the @xmath32 process  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one could consider the label @xmath33 , but different times @xmath34 , resulting in the same limit process  @xcite .",
    "this can also be derived from the fixed time result using the slow decorrelations along characteristics  @xcite .    in our contribution we will investigate the equally spaced initial condition @xmath35 , @xmath36 .",
    "our main result is that the limit ( [ 4 ] ) still holds provided @xmath29 is replaced by @xmath37 , that is , the tracy ",

    "but it is expected that the result holds in greater generality for a large class of potentials .    for the one - sided collision limit , the solution to ( [ 3 ] ) can be represented as a last passage problem , which has the same structure as directed polymers at zero temperature  @xcite .",
    "also , ( [ 3 ] ) can be viewed as a particular discretization of the kpz equation  @xcite .",

    "this limit is our @xmath439 .",
    "the image of @xmath574 under @xmath575 , @xmath90 and @xmath576 is @xmath88 , so @xmath577 , which corresponds to @xmath371 .",
    "consider first @xmath578 .",
    "since all the involved branches lie in the upper half plane , we have @xmath579 . additionally , the fact that the transformations @xmath580 and @xmath581 map the upper half plane onto itself implies by ( [ eqdiffid ] ) the inequality @xmath582 .",
