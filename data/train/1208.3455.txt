    "core collapse supernovae ( sne ) mark the spectacular death of massive stars . among these sne types",
    "ib and ic ( collectively referred to as ib / c due to their perceived similarities ) are associated with the explosion of massive stars which were stripped of their h envelopes by strong stellar winds .",
    "types ib show he features in their spectra , whereas types ic do not .",
    "our current understanding of type ib / c sne suggests that wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars are a primary progenitor path @xcite , although the relative numbers of wr stars fall well short of the observed type ib / c rates and thus a lower - mass binary progenitor path is most likely required to account for a significant fraction of these events ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "archival imaging of pre - sne locations , however , have failed to produce direct associations between type ib / c sne and their possible progenitors .",
    "thus we must rely both on theory and indirect information obtained after the explosion .",
    "fortunately , x - ray and radio emission are detectable by - products of the shock interaction between the high - velocity ejecta and the low - velocity progenitor wind in sne ( whereas the optical emission is generated by lower - velocity ejecta and radioactive decay ) .",
    "these observables crudely scale with the density of the circumstellar medium ( csm ) , and hence provide constraints on the wind properties of the sn progenitor ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . because massive stars are expected to have strong episodic mass - loss ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and line driven winds ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , radio monitoring of type ib / c sne provide interesting constraints on possible progenitor types .",
    "the past decade has witnessed increased attention on type ib / c sne due to the association of type ic sn 1998bw with gamma - ray burst ( grb ) 980425 @xcite , as these objects may help elucidate how the central engines of both grbs and their associated sne work . following this historic connection ,",
    "several other type ic sne have been linked to grbs ; all of these objects show broad emission lines in their optical spectra , with velocities above @xmath10 . to date",
    "so far 5 grbs have been spectroscopically confirmed to have a sne counterpart , while 14 show photometric evidence of a sne counterpart @xcite , and hence a larger sample is needed in order to shed some light on the explosion mechanisms involved . given the large number of sne type ic compared to grbs",
    ", one key question is whether these sne could simply be off - axis grbs .",
    "initial efforts concluded that the vast majority were not ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "recently new evidence was presented for the detection of at least one possible off - axis grb with no direct observation of the gamma - ray emission : sn 2009bb @xcite ; as well as the more controversial sn 2007gr @xcite .    here",
    "we report on a particularly interesting broad - lined type ic , sn 2007bg , which was optically discovered on 2007 april 16.15 ut at @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( j2000 ) at redshift @xmath13 @xcite ( @xmath14 mpc , @xmath15 km s@xmath16 mpc@xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 in a @xmath19cdm cosmology ) . a spectrum taken on 2007 april 18.3 with the 9.2 m hobby - everly telescope",
    "let @xcite classify sn 2007bg as a type ic broad - lined ( ic - bl ) supernova .",
    "the classification of this sn as a type ic and the fact that it resides in a faint host encouraged @xcite to think about this object as a likely off - axis grb .",
    "@xcite also noted that sn 2007bg was one of the brightest radio sne one year after explosion , making it an even better candidate for an off - axis grb .",
    "however , based on the radio light curve of sn 2007bg known at the time , @xcite contended that the observed radio emission could be explained by the presence of a density enhancement in the csm , rather than a grb like central engine driving the explosion . using the archival radio data for sn 2007bg",
    ", we further address this issue below .",

    "our results and modelling of the radio light curves are presented in ",
    "[ s : results ] . finally in ",
    "[ s : discussion ] we summarise our findings and provide a brief discussion on the future of radio observations of sne .",
    "the vla radio observations were carried out between 2007 april 19 and 2009 august 28 as part of the programs as887 , as929 and as983 ( pi a. m. soderberg ) .",

    "data were collected at @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 ghz . as primary flux density calibrators 3c286 and 3c147 were used .",
    "we used these calibrators to scale our flux density measurements to the perley - buttler 2010 absolute flux scale . for secondary calibrators",
    "three different sources were used ; sdss j114856.56 + 525425.2 in most epochs , as well as sdss j114644.20 + 535643.0 and sbs 1150 + 497 .",
    "the derived flux density for the secondary calibrators is shown in table [ tab : phase ] .",
    "traditionally one has been able to cross - check the derived secondary calibrator fluxes with archival data , but in this case the vla stopped regular monitoring of calibrators since 2007 .",

    "[ f : vel ] and we note that sn 2007bg has an average expansion speed of @xmath83 typical of type ib / c rsne and it shows one of the highest luminosities among type ib / c s and comparable to those of grbs .",

    "synchrotron emission from sne originates from the shock region between the sne ejecta and the pre - existing csm .",
    "this shock amplifies the existing magnetic fields via turbulence .",
    "the electrons in the shock region then interact with this magnetic field producing the observed synchrotron emission .",
    "this emission is subject to self - absorption , which is caused by ssa @xcite in the case of low density environments . to describe the time evolution of the flux density during phase 1 we adopt the parametrization of @xcite in which the radio emission originates from a spherical thin shell of width @xmath84 expanding at a velocity @xmath85 in which the intrinsic synchrotron emission is absorbed by ssa .",
    "the parameter @xmath86 is the number of shells that fit into the size of the source with a value of @xmath87 @xcite .",
    "we adopt the assumptions of the standard model of @xcite where the hydrodynamic evolution of the ejecta is self - similar across the shock discontinuity . with this assumption",
    "the radius of the source evolves as @xmath88 where the parameter @xmath89 is related to the density profile of the outer sn ejecta @xmath90 and the density profile of the radiating electrons in the shock region @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .",
    "the self similar model also requires that @xmath93 , @xmath94 and @xmath89 in the range @xmath95 .",
    "the model also assumes that the magnetic energy density and the relativistic electron energy density scale as the total post - shock energy density .",
    "this implies that the fraction of energy contained in the relativistic electrons @xmath96 and magnetic field @xmath97 remains fixed .",
    "this in turn relates the magnetic field evolution @xmath98 , to the radius of the source and the density profile of the radiating electrons @xmath99 .",
    "this means that for a freely expanding wind @xmath100 , the magnetic field evolves as @xmath101 . for our analysis",
    "we adopt a source in equipartition with @xmath102 .",
    "equipartition of energy minimizes the total energy .    using this model and requiring the time evolution of the magnetic field",
    "to go as @xmath101 we find that the radius of the source evolves as @xmath103 .",
    "we will refer to this as model 1 .",
    "this is consistent with a shock expanding freely through the csm .",
    "the normalization constants for the flux density and ssa are @xmath104 g s@xmath16 and @xmath105 s@xmath106 , giving a reduced chi square value of @xmath107 for 22 degrees of freedom .",
    "these values require the size of the source to go as @xmath108 cm , which in turn means that the expansion velocity is @xmath109 .",
    "the magnetic field goes as @xmath110 g and the energy is @xmath111 erg . for this we assumed a synchrotron characteristic frequency of @xmath112 ghz . using these values we can also estimate the mass - loss rate of the progenitor .",

    "this mass - loss rate lies at the low end of those observed for wr stars in low metallicity environments @xcite .",
    "the derived mass - loss rates from this model depend on the fraction of energy contained in relativistic electrons and magnetic fields , deviations from equipartition would require higher mass - loss rates and energy requirements .    the early data hint at a shallower slope of the light curve ,",
    "so we also fit a second model , model 2 , where we allow the magnetic field evolution to change as @xmath114 and the source size as @xmath115 . in this model",

    "the normalization constants are @xmath117 g s@xmath16 and @xmath118 s@xmath106 .",
    "this implies a source size evolution of @xmath119 cm , and an expansion velocity of @xmath120 .",

    "again we have used the same parameters for @xmath123 and @xmath86 .",
    "given this time evolution for the magnetic field and source size , the density radial profile goes as @xmath124 and the number density of emitting electrons as @xmath125 .",
    "we adopt the result from model 2 , as it provides a better fit to the data , although we can not truly rule out model 1 due to the lack of early detections .",
    "given this mass - loss rate , the circumstellar density for a wind stratified medium @xmath126 , defined as @xmath127 g cm@xmath16 @xcite , is @xmath129 . under these conditions",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in our observations thus provide strong evidence against an expanding grb jet being the source of the observed luminosity for sn 2007bg .      as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ f : lc ] , at around day @xmath59 the flux density at @xmath23 and @xmath22 ghz suddenly decreases creating a break in the power law flux decay of the optically thin radio emission . at @xmath23 ghz the observed flux is a @xmath133 less than the predicted one at the beginning of phase 2 on day @xmath134 .",
    "based on the derived size of the radio emitting region , from the ssa modelling , this drop occurs at a distance of @xmath135 cm .",
    "the most likely cause for this decrease in the radio emission is a drop in the csm density . here",
    "we consider two scenarios that would produce a change in csm density such as a binary companion or two different wind components from the progenitor star .",
    "in the first scenario , there should be evidence of this interaction from the optical spectra as balmer series recombination lines .",

    "the early optical spectra evidence points to a broad - lined sne , most likely associated with sne like 1998bw , and the latest optical spectra of sn 2007bg where it is detected does not show evidence for a transition from a type ib / c to a type ii . for this kind of sne",
    "the most likely progenitor is a single wr .",
    "also if there was a binary companion we would expect to see coherence between the emission before and after the drop / increase ( depending on whether the csm density dropped / increased at the region of interest ) . in the case of sn 2007bg",
    ", we see a @xmath136 dex jump in the normalizations of the unabsorbed phase 1 and phase 3 light curves , as well as a strong enhancement in absorption , making a binary companion csm scenario highly unlikely .",
    "the second scenario considered is that the drop in flux density is due to a change in the progenitor wind .",
    "based on the distance of the drop and with our assumed wind speed of @xmath137 km",
    "s@xmath16 the change occurred @xmath138 yr before the explosion and lasted for @xmath139 yr . since @xmath140",
    "@xcite a flux density decrease of @xmath133 implies that the mass - loss rate / wind speed dropped by a factor of @xmath141 .",
    "for this estimate we have used @xmath142 .",
    "our modelling of the light curves during phase 1 suggests that the density profile of the csm is shallower ( i.e. , smaller @xmath89 ) , but as discussed bellow , this relation overestimates the mass - loss rate in such cases .",
    "phase 3 begins around day @xmath63 with an increase in the flux density at @xmath25 , @xmath23 and @xmath22 ghz . as discussed in ",
    "[ s : results ] the luminosity of the source during this phase is larger than in phase 1 in all of the bands where we detect it .",
    "this flux density rise shows the characteristics of an absorption turn - on . at @xmath25 ghz",
    "we observe what appears to be the peak of the turn - on on day @xmath143 , and at longer wavelengths the radio spectrum begins to turn - on near the end of observations .",
    "this turn - on is accompanied by an increase in the spectral index suggesting that the source has become optically thick again .",
    "the luminosity increase implies a sharp csm density enhancement , presumably due to evolution of the progenitor wind , while the observed re - absorption requires either ssa or ffa .",
    "following @xcite we can estimate the mass - loss rate from the progenitor assuming that the absorption is purely ffa .",
    "adopting the time of peak at @xmath22 ghz as the time when the free - free optical depth is unity , and taking the expansion velocity of the shock from phase 1 then the mass - loss rate is @xmath144 .",
    "this rate is suspiciously high and inconsistent with our estimate ( later in this section ) of the mass - loss rate based on the unabsorbed portion of the spectrum .",
    "this high rate favours ssa .",
    "the absorption slope is relatively flat , and thus pure ssa with a similar model as fit to phase 1 does a poor job of fitting the turn - on .",
    "one possibility is differential ssa arising from small dense clumps in the csm , which are preferentially affected by ssa while sparser regions are less affected ; this naturally flattens the optically thick slope .",
    "the existence of clumpy winds in wr stars has been confirmed by observations @xcite , and thus provides a natural way of explaining the observed radio emission .",
    "alternatively , the density jump would naturally produce strong x - ray emission , which could ionize csm material in front of the shock and provide the necessary free electrons for ffa .",
    "however , without constraints on the x - ray luminosity and phase 3 csm density distribution for sn2007bg , it is difficult to assess the feasibility of ffa . given the poor fit of the pure ssa model ( @xmath145 ) , we simply adopt the parametrization of including only a clumpy csm with the presence of internal ssa . in this case the flux density is normalised by @xmath146 , the clumpy csm absorption by @xmath147 and ssa by @xmath148 .",
    "we fit the above model to the light curve during phase 3 .",
    "the best - fit values are given in table [ t : phase3 ] .",

    "[ f : lc ] , this model provides a reasonable fit to the light curves at all frequencies and also to the spectral index , fig .",
    "[ f : si ] .",
    "the deviant point at @xmath21 ghz could be easily affected by the host galaxy luminosity .",
    "the data did not allow us to constrain the deceleration rate , so we adopted a constant expansion by fixing @xmath161 , which in turn requires that @xmath162 given the spectral index .",
    "using our best - fit values we can estimate the mass - loss rate from the progenitor during this period following equations ( 11 ) and ( 13 ) of .",
    "the effective optical depth at the time of our latest observation , @xmath163 days , at @xmath22 ghz is @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "if we extrapolate the velocity derived in  [ ssec : ssa ] to phase 3 , @xmath166 at @xmath167 days , then the derived mass - loss rate is @xmath168 , where an electron temperature of @xmath169 k was used . this mass - loss rate is higher than the one observed during phase 1 , which is a natural explanation for the high luminosity observed during phase 3 .",
    "however , such a large mass - loss rate has not yet been directly observed , and it is at odds with the metallicity mass - loss rate relation derived from the milky way and magellanic clouds wr samples ( see for e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this relation predicts orders of magnitude lower @xmath170 in such a low metallicity host . on the other hand , this large mass - loss rate is also roughly consistent with that of the saturation limit for line - driven winds , @xmath171 , and is of the same order of magnitude as values found in other type ib / c sne ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we should caution however that the dramatic flux increase between phases 1 and 3 implies a strong density contrast that is inconsistent with one of the primary assumptions of the @xcite self - similar model ( namely a csm density profile with a power - law slope ) .",
    "this density discontinuity could naturally lead to an overestimate of the mass - loss rate ; to properly account for this type of case , one should generally model the hydrodynamics in detail ; unfortunately , such simulations are not well - constrained by radio data alone due to ambiguities in how the b - field and electron density distribution might change across the density discontinuity and are beyond the scope of this work .",
    "thus this phase 3 mass - loss rate should be regarded with caution and viewed as a likely upper limit .",
    "the strong mass - loss variations on such short time - scales seen here imply that the progenitor of sn 2007bg may have undergone unstable mass - loss just prior to explosion or a dramatic change in wind properties .",
    "such rapid variations have been seen in a handful of objects before .",
    "for instance , in the case of type ib sn 2006jc @xcite , a bright optical transient was observed two years prior to explosion .",
    "this was interpreted as a luminous blue variable - like outburst event from the progenitor , which the later sn explosion surely interacted with .",
    "then there are other possibilities like the case of type iin sn 1996cr @xcite . in this event",
    ", the radio light curve also exhibits a strong late - time rise in emission associated with a density enhancement likely arising from the interaction of the sn blast - wave with a wind - blown bubble @xcite .",
    "the progenitor of sn 1996cr is proposed to be either a wr or blue supergiant star .",
    "we still know relatively little about why such global changes in the progenitors occur , but it seems clear that a subset of sne progenitors have them .",
    "x - ray emission from supernovae can arise from three mechanisms ; non - thermal emission from synchrotron radiating electrons , thermal bremsstrahlung emission from the material in the circumstellar and reverse shocks , and inverse compton emission . since x - ray emission from sn 2007bg could not be detected it is difficult to assess the feasibility of each of these mechanisms , so we will compare the derived mass - loss rates from the previous subsections with that predicted by the thermal bremsstrahlung process .",
    "if the x - ray emission comes from synchrotron radiating electrons then the x - ray luminosity can be obtained by extrapolating the radio synchrotron spectrum up to higher frequencies . to do this",
    "we must consider that the synchrotron spectrum changes its slope at the cooling frequency @xmath172 by a factor @xmath173 @xcite .",
    "using the derived magnetic field @xmath174 from our ssa analysis of the radio light curve  [ ssec : ssa ] we find that @xmath175 ghz .",
    "extrapolation of the luminosity as @xmath176 from the cooling break on gives a x - ray luminosity 5 orders of magnitude bellow our upper limit @xmath177 days after explosion ( epoch 2 ) .",
    "extrapolation of the cooling frequency up to epochs 3 and 4 of the x - ray data yields x - ray fluxes @xmath74 orders of magnitude bellow the upper limits .",
    "however , as mentioned in previous sections , the csm discontinuity between phases 1 and 3 could cause a break in the magnetic field evolution .",
    "x - ray emission from thermal bremsstrahlung comes from the interaction of the shocked electrons with the circumstellar material .",
    "this interaction heats the electrons in the medium which then cool via free - free emission . in this process",
    "the x - ray luminosity is related to the density of the emitting material as @xmath178 @xcite .",
    "we can obtain an upper limit on the mass - loss rate from the x - ray luminosity upper limits using equation ( 30 ) of @xcite . at @xmath179 days",
    "the x - ray luminosity is @xmath180 .",
    "we use the density profile of the outer sne ejecta derived from our ssa analysis , @xmath124 . given this luminosity and csm properties thermal bremsstrahlung requires a mass - loss rate of @xmath181 . at epochs 3 and 4 of the x - ray data we obtain mass - loss rates of @xmath182 and @xmath183 respectively .",
    "these mass - loss rates are consistent with the one required by ssa during phase 1 and the light curve during phase 3 .    inverse compton scattering of the optical photons by the relativistic synchrotron emitting electrons can also be a cause of x - ray emission in sne .",
    "it has been shown that this process played an important role in the case of sn 2002ap @xcite , sn 2003l @xcite and 2003bg @xcite . using equation ( 15 ) of @xcite",
    "we obtain a ratio of @xmath184 @xmath177 days after explosion . for this",
    "we have used a bolometric luminosity of @xmath185 erg s@xmath16 based on the pseudo - bolometric light curves for sn 2007bg of . given the ratio @xmath186 and the radio flux of @xmath187 erg s@xmath16 @xmath47",
    "the derived x - ray luminosity of @xmath188 erg s@xmath16 @xmath47 is in agreement with our upper limits . for later epochs we can not estimate the bolometric luminosity of sn 2007bg",
    "in this article we presented the radio light curves and x - ray observations of type ic - bl sn 2007bg .",
    "the radio emission is characterised by three different phases .",
    "phase 1 being characterised by a ssa turn - on . based on the brightness temperature of sn 2007bg the expansion speed of the radio emitting region",
    "is @xmath189 .",
    "an expansion speed similar to what has been found in the small sample of radio - emitting type ib / c sne .",
    "the derived mass - loss rate from the progenitor during phase 1 is @xmath0 , a low mass - loss rate among the observed in wr stars . during phase 2",
    "we observe a drop in the flux density while the spectral index seems to follow a smooth evolution .",
    "this drop is presumably due to the radio ejecta entering a region of lower csm density , probably arising because of a change in the mass - loss rate of the progenitor or a variable wind speed .",
    "then during phase 3 we observe a rise in the radio flux density along with a re - absorption of the radio emission .",
    "the shallow observed slope of the re - absorption could be explained by small clumps of material in the progenitor wind which would become more strongly self - absorbed than the surrounding csm when shocked and produce a shallower optically - thick spectrum . from our modelling of the radio light curves during phase 3 we put an upper limit on the mass - loss rate of @xmath5 .",
    "this second wind component could arise from a different stellar evolution phase of the progenitor prior to explosion , possibly a lbv phase . or it could be the effect of stellar rotation on the stellar wind properties . if the radio flux density from sn 2007bg declines in time like @xmath190",
    ". it should still be detectable , with a flux density at @xmath25 ghz of @xmath191 , and higher at lower frequencies .",
    "if the progenitor star went through more mass - loss episodes , then the observed flux density would deviate from this value .",
    "recent observations taken with the karl g. jansky very large array ( jvla ) should help to establish this .",
    "very few broad - lined type ic sne have radio detections , and none of them show signs of a complex csm like that of sn 2007bg .",
    "these different wind components , along with the derived mass - loss rates will eventually help to constrain the progenitors of type ib / c sne , from their inferred pre - sne properties .",
    "currently two main evolutionary paths has been proposed to account for the rate of these explosions : a single wr origin , and a binary system .",
    "however , the single wr scenario itself still needs significant clarification .",
    "for instance , what effects do evolution ( mass - loss , rotation , etc . ) and metallicity have in shaping the csm around massive type ib / c progenitors and ultimately their explosions . and",
    "more generally , how does this fold into the connection between type ii s , type ib / c , and grbs .    compounded by their relative rarity , a key impediment to improving",
    "our knowledge of broad - lined ic sne has been the lack of high - quality , multi - frequency observations from early through late epochs .",
    "sensitive high - frequency radio observations of ic sne within 1 - 2 days of explosion are needed to efficiently identify the best objects for follow - up and allow further refinement of the physical properties surrounding these unique explosions . both alma and",
    "the newly retooled jvla will play critical roles here , providing rigorous probes of the synchrotron - emitting shock ( to constrain evolution of the shock velocity , any potential beaming , etc . ) and ultimately new insights into the properties of their csm ( such as density , variability , clumpiness , and perhaps even dust content for these massive systems ) .",
    "sensitive , long - term x - ray and optical / nir spectroscopic follow - up are also needed in order to break potential degeneracies and provide consistency checks against the shock - csm interaction models .",
    "if such complete datasets can be assembled in the next several years , they may afford us a leap in our physical understanding of sne and grbs .",
