    "thin - shell wormholes ( tsws ) constitute one of the wormhole classes in which the exotic matter is confined on a hypersurface and therefore can be minimized @xcite ( the @xmath4dimensional thin - shell wormholes is considered in @xcite and with a cosmological constant is studied in @xcite ) .",
    "finding a physical ( i.e. non - exotic ) source to wormholes of any kind remains ever a challenging problem in einstein s general relativity . in this regard",
    "we must add that modified theories of gravity presents more alternatives with their extra degrees of freedom .",
    "we recall , however , that each modified theory partly cures while partly adds its own complications .",
    "staying within einstein s general relativity and finding remedies seems to be the prominent approach provided the proper spacetimes are employed .",
    "an interesting class of spacetimes that may serve the purpose is the spacetimes of regular black holes .    _ our motivation for choosing a regular black hole in wormhole construction can be justified by the fact that a regular system can be established from a finite energy . _ _ in the high energy collision experiments for instance , formation of such regular objects are more tenable . _",
    "such a black hole was discovered first by bardeen and came to be known as bardeen black hole @xcite .",
    "ayon - beato and garcia in their letter ayon introduced a non - linear electric field source for the bardeen black hole .",
    "bronnikov , later on , showed that the regular `` electric '' black holes e.g. , the one considered by ayon - beato and a. garcia , are not quite correct solutions to the field equations because in these solutions the electromagnetic lagrangian is inevitably different in different parts of space . on the contrary , quite correct solutions of this kind ( and even with the same metric ) can be readily obtained with a magnetic field ( since in ned there is no such duality as in the linear maxwell theory ) .",
    "all this is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "a similar type of black hole solution was given by hayward @xcite which provides the main motivation and fuel to the present study .",
    "this particular black hole solution has well - defined asymptotic limits , namely it is schwarzschild for @xmath5 and de - sitter for @xmath6 in order to make a better account of the hayward black hole we attempt first to explore its physical source .",
    "for this reason we search for the non - linear electrodynamics ( ned ) and find that a magnetic field within this theory accounts for such a source . note that every ned does nt admit a linear maxwell limit and indeed this is precisely the case that we face in the present problem . in other words , if our ned model did have a maxwell limit then the hayward spacetime should coincide with the reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) limit .",
    "such a limit does nt exist in the present problem .",
    "once we fix our bulk spacetime the next step is to locate the thin - shell which must lie outside the event horizon of the black hole .",
    "the surface energy - momentum tensor on the shell must satisfy the israel junction conditions @xcite . as the equation of state ( eos ) for the energy - momentum on the shell we choose different models which are abbreviated by @xmath7 . here",
    "@xmath2 stands for the surface pressure , @xmath3 is the mass ( energy ) density and @xmath8 is a function of @xmath9 we consider the following cases : i ) linear gas ( lg ) @xcite , where @xmath10 is a linear function of @xmath9 ii ) chaplygin gas ( cg ) @xcite , where @xmath11 iii ) generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) @xcite , where @xmath12 ( @xmath13 constant ) .",

    "v ) and logarithmic gas ( logg ) , where @xmath15 for each of the case we plot the second derivative of the derived potential function @xmath16 , where @xmath17 stands for the equilibrium point .",
    "the region that the second derivative is positive ( i.e. @xmath18 ) yields the regions of stability which are all depicted in figures .",
    "this summarizes our strategy that we adopt in the present paper for the stability of the thin shell wormholes constructed from the hayward black hole .",
    "organization of the paper is as follows .",
    "section ii reviews the hayward black hole and determines a lagrangian for it .",
    "derivation of the stability condition is carried out in section iii .",
    "particular examples of equations of state follow in section iv .",
    "small velocity perturbations is the subject of section v. the paper ends with the conclusion in section vi .",
    "the spherically symmetric static hayward nonsingular black hole introduced in @xcite is given by the following line element@xmath19 in which @xmath20 and @xmath21 are two free parameters and @xmath22the metric function of this black hole @xmath23 at large @xmath24 behaves as@xmath25while at small @xmath24 @xmath26from the asymptotic form of the metric function at small and large @xmath24 one observes that the hayward nonsingular black hole is a de - sitter black hole for small @xmath24 and schwarzschild spacetime for large @xmath24 .",
    "the curvature scalars are all finite at @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the hayward black hole admits event horizon which is the largest real root of the following equation@xmath28setting @xmath29 and @xmath30 this becomes@xmath31which admits no horizon ( regular particle solution ) for @xmath32 single horizon ( regular extremal black hole ) for @xmath33 and double horizons ( regular black hole with two horizons ) for @xmath34 .",

    "let us note that the subsequent analysis will fix @xmath58 in terms of the other parameters .",
    "the magnetic field two form is given by@xmath59 in which @xmath60 stands for the magnetic monopole charge .",
    "this field form together with the line element ( 1 ) imply@xmath61the einstein - ned field equations are ( @xmath62 ) @xmath63 in which @xmath64with @xmath65 one can show that using @xmath66 given in ( 12 ) , the einstein equations admit the hayward regular black hole metric provided @xmath67 the weak field limit of the lagrangian ( 12 ) can be found by expanding the lagrangian about @xmath68 which reads@xmath69it is observed that in the weak field limit the ned lagrangian does not yield the linear maxwell lagrangian i.e. , @xmath70 for this reason we do not expect that the metric function in weak field limit gives the rn black hole solution as it was described in ( 3 ) .",
    "in this section we use the standard method of making a timelike tsw and for this reason to consider a timelike thin - shell located at @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) by cutting the region @xmath73 from the hayward regular black hole and paste two copies of it at @xmath71 . on the shell",

    "in this section we restrict ourselves to the small velocity perturbations about the equilibrium point @xmath100 such that at any proper time after the perturbation we can consider the fluid supporting the shell to be approximately static . thus one can accept the dynamic eos of the wormhole same as the static eos @xcite .",
    "this assumption , therefore , implies that the eos is uniquely determined by @xmath139 and @xmath99 , described by eqs .",

    "( 44 ) , up to the second order of @xmath148 admits @xmath149similar to the previous case , this motion is not also oscillatory which implies that the throat is unstable against the small velocity perturbation .",
    "nevertheless , eq . ( 42 ) shows that the acceleration of the throat is given by @xmath150 which is positive for both the schwarzschild and hayward bulks .",
    "thus the motion of the throat is not oscillatory and consequently the corresponding tsw is not stable .",
    "thin - shell wormholes are constructed from the regular black hole ( or non - black hole for certain range of parameters ) discovered by hayward .",
    "we show first that this solution is powered by a magnetic monopole field within the context of non - linear electrodynamics ( ned ) .",

    "the method of identifying these regions relies on the reduction of the perturbation equations to a harmonic equation of the form @xmath151 for @xmath152 stability simply amounts to the condition for @xmath153 which is plotted numerically . in all different equations of state we obtained stable regions and observed that the hayward parameter @xmath136 plays a crucial role in establishing the stability",
