    "at several years since the pioneering discovery in atmospheric neutrino observation by super - kamiokande ( sk )  @xcite , we now have compelling evidences for neutrino oscillation .",
    "the direct confirmation of oscillation of atmospheric neutrinos comes from the k2k experiment using man - made neutrino beam @xcite which confirmed its existence at 3.9@xmath10 cl @xcite .",
    "the neutrino oscillation with the solar @xmath11 scale is beautifully observed by the kamland experiment @xcite . by observing deficit in reactor antineutrino flux it pinned down the large - mixing - angle ( lma ) solution of the solar neutrino problem based on the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) mechanism  @xcite .",
    "it has thereby settled the long - standing solar neutrino problem @xcite , whose origin was identified as due to the neutrino flavor transformation by sno  @xcite .",
    "long awaited confirmation of the oscillatory behavior is now available by the three experiments , sk  @xcite , k2k @xcite , and kamland  @xcite .",
    "thus , we already know roughly the structure of lepton flavor mixing in the ( 1 - 2 ) and ( 2 - 3 ) sectors of the maki - nakagawa - sakata ( mns ) matrix  @xcite .",
    "we recognize that there are two small ( or possibly vanishing ) quantities in the lepton mixing matrix , @xmath6 and deviation of @xmath0 from @xmath12 .",
    "the former is constrained mainly by the reactor experiments  @xcite to be @xmath13 at 90%  cl by a global analysis  @xcite , while the latter is bounded as @xmath14 at 90%  cl by the recent reanalysis of atmospheric neutrino data by the sk group  @xcite .",
    "possible correlation between these two small quantities may imply hints for the yet unknown discipline that was used by nature to design the structure of lepton flavor mixing .",
    "some symmetries have been discussed by which the maximal @xmath0 is correlated with vanishing @xmath6 in the symmetry limit @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the question of how large is the deviation of @xmath0 from @xmath12 is discussed from a variety of viewpoints @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is important to determine the value of not only @xmath6 but also @xmath0 very precisely .",
    "how accurately @xmath0 can be measured experimentally ?",
    "it appears that measurement of disappearance probability of @xmath1 at around the first oscillation maximum has highest sensitivity to @xmath2 .",
    ", if @xmath15 from reactors is used  @xcite . in this case",
    ", the accuracy for @xmath16 measurement translates into the one of @xmath17 without suffering from the problems ( apart from the third one ) mentioned below . ] in the j - parc @xmath18 super - kamiokande ( jparc - sk ) experiment , for example , @xmath2 is expected to be determined to 1% accuracies @xcite .",
    "given such an enormous accuracy , it seems that there is not much to add because it looks like the best thinkable accuracy of mixing angle determination in neutrino experiments .",
    "unfortunately , it is not quite true .",
    "we discuss three relevant and mutually related issues in this paper which prevent an accurate determination of @xmath0 , in particular , its small deviation from the maximal .",
    "the points we discuss are :    * a large jacobian associated with transformation of the variable from @xmath2 to @xmath3 at around the maximal mixing * the octant ambiguity of @xmath0 ( two solutions of @xmath0 larger or smaller than @xmath12 ) * effects of three - flavor mixing , in particular of non - vanishing @xmath6    while the first point is `` kinematical '' in nature , the second and the third points reflect the three - flavor structure of lepton mixing .",
    "although each of these points was discussed in various occasions in the past , we believe that they are never discussed in a coherent fashion in the context of precision measurement of @xmath0 by long - baseline ( lbl ) experiments",
    ". the estimation of errors of @xmath0 determination is also done by taking account of three - flavor mixing effects @xcite with consistent results with ours .",
    "yet , they offer neither understanding of the reasons behind the estimated large errors in the similar depth as we provide , nor ways of improvement by combining with e.g. , reactor measurement .",
    "importance of experimental determination of @xmath6 is now well recognized in the community by itself and as a door to exploration of leptonic cp violation .",
    "strategies for determining the remaining oscillation parameters are developed with use of accelerator superbeam  @xcite and reactor neutrinos  @xcite , which followed by a series of feasible experimental programs  @xcite .",
    "the accuracies of @xmath6 determination in the lbl and the reactor experiments are expected to reach to @xmath19 .",
    "we feel that the strategy for similar accurate determination of @xmath0 is relatively less well developed , and it is the purpose of this paper to trigger such efforts .    by indicating that the three - flavor nature of the oscillation probability already manifests itself in the next generation lbl experiments",
    ", our discussion in this paper might have an implication to future neutrino oscillation research , suggesting a possible direction .",
    "the next to leading order corrections may be important due to the larger ratio of @xmath20 due to a larger @xmath21 @xcite , and possible large value of @xmath6 close to the chooz bound . under such hope ,",
    "we present in appendix a a derivation of the full expression of survival probability @xmath22 to the next to leading order in @xmath23 and @xmath8 , which is used in our analyses throughout this paper .",
    "see also @xcite for derivation of such formulas under the similar spirit .",
    "in this section we present pedagogical description of the three reasons for difficulty of accurate determination of @xmath0 that were mentioned in sec .",

    "the ultimate purpose of the whole experimental activities which aim at measuring neutrino mixing parameters is to understand physics of lepton flavor mixing . for this purpose precise determination of the angles or the sine of angles",
    "are required .",
    "the @xmath1 disappearance measurement is sensitive to @xmath2 , not @xmath3 , which is unfortunate , but is actually the case .",
    "it inherently makes accuracy of determination of @xmath0 much worse than it is achieved for @xmath2 at around the maximal mixing . assuming that the true value of @xmath0 is @xmath12 , for example , an accurate measurement of @xmath2 with error of 1% level translates into large error of @xmath24% level for @xmath3 .",
    "it is simply because the jacobian for the transformation of the variables @xmath25 are large at around @xmath26 , by which a tiny error obtained for @xmath2 , denoted as @xmath27 in ( [ jacobian ] ) , can be translated into a large error @xmath28 for @xmath29 .",
    "it is what happens in fig .",
    "[ ser_30_theta ] in sec .",
    "[ analysis ] .",
    "we emphasize that use of @xmath3 , not @xmath2 , is inevitable in the error analysis based on three flavor mixing because the @xmath1 survival probability itself can not be expressed in terms of @xmath2 only once next to the leading order correction is taken into account",
    ". see ( [ pvac ] ) below and ( [ survivalp ] ) for the probabilities in vacuum and in matter , respectively .",
    "it is even more so if we combine @xmath7 appearance measurement into our analysis , as will be done in sec .",
    "[ app+react ] , because the dominant term in the @xmath7 appearance probability depends upon @xmath0 through @xmath3 .",
    "the dominant term in @xmath1 survival probability , and hence the disappearance measurement , is sensitive primarily to @xmath2 .",
    "therefore , there exist two solutions of @xmath0 for a given value of the survival probability @xmath22 , the octant ambiguity of @xmath0 . , @xmath0 and @xmath30 , for a given set of measured oscillation probabilities .",
    "it is called the problem of parameter degeneracy @xcite , and the octant ambiguity of @xmath0 is only a part of it .",
    "the nature of the degeneracy may be characterized as the intrinsic degeneracy of @xmath6 and @xmath30 @xcite , which is duplicated by the unknown sign of @xmath31 @xcite and the octant ambiguity of @xmath0 for a given @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "the octant ambiguity may be the most difficult one to resolve among the eight - fold parameter degeneracies unless it is combined with either reactor @xcite or silver channel @xcite measurement . ] in fig .",
    "[ th - a_reg ] we present a contour of 90%  cl allowed region in @xmath33 space by 5 years measurement at jparc - sk based on the analysis in sec .  [ analysis ] whose details will be explained in appendix b.    it should be noticed in fig .",
    "[ th - a_reg ] that there exist `` clone '' solutions , which arise as a consequence of the degeneracy of @xmath0 solutions  @xcite .",
    "namely , with an assumed true value @xmath34 , for example , the measurement allows two regions as solutions , one around the original value of @xmath35 in the first octant and the other one around @xmath36 which is the reflected point with respect to @xmath26 in the second octant . of course , it does not produce additional experimental error of @xmath3 as far as two regions are separated , though ambiguity exists of which region contains the true value of @xmath0 .",
    "but once the two allowed regions start to merge ( which takes place near the maximal @xmath0 ) , it does produce additional error of @xmath3 as exhibited in the spike in fig .",

    "then , the disappearance probability @xmath55 in vacuum is given by @xmath56 in the right - hand side of ( [ pvac ] ) , the first term represents major contribution which survives in the two - flavor or the single mass - scale dominance approximation @xcite . the second and the third terms are small corrections due to non - vanishing @xmath8 and @xmath57 , respectively , which give effects of the three - flavor mixing .",
    "it is obvious that the second term vanishes for the maximal @xmath0 , while the third term vanishes at the oscillation maximum , @xmath58 .",
    "suppose that we perform a hypothetical experiment at a monochromatic energy close ( but not identical ) to the oscillation maximum , @xmath59 .",

    "the equation ( [ pvacom ] ) clearly indicates that the larger value of @xmath65 gives the smaller ( larger ) value of @xmath60 in first ( second ) octant of @xmath0 for a given @xmath66 .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the feature of @xmath0-@xmath6 correlation is in fact shared in fig .",

    "[ app ] that the accuracy of @xmath0 measurement is indeed improved thanks to the help by @xmath7 appearance experiment or reactor measurement of @xmath6 .",
    "the reason why the better sensitivity of @xmath0 is obtained at smaller @xmath110 in the case with appearance measurement is that the error of @xmath101 determination increases for greater values of @xmath110 due to larger @xmath111 in ( [ chi2e ] ) .",
    "in fact , the case presented in fig .",
    "[ app]b with @xmath112 represents the best sensitivity attainable by combined appearance - disappearance measurement .",
    "notice that the error of @xmath0 can not be smaller than that of two - flavor fitting ( @xmath113 ) because it is the limit of no uncertainty in @xmath6 . moreover , appearance measurement itself is not very sensitive to @xmath0 and hence it plays only a supplementary role by constraining @xmath6 .",
    "it is also shown in fig .",
    "[ app ] that with reactor measurement of @xmath6 the error of @xmath0 determination is reduced to the one expected in the two - flavor fitting with @xmath114 independent of the values of @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the reactor measurement of @xmath6 can do a better job in improving accuracy of @xmath0 determination in relatively large @xmath80 .",
    "it is due to the feature that the uncertainty in @xmath6 determination in reactor experiments is insensitive to the true values of @xmath6 , and that it is a pure measurement of @xmath6 . in the combined analysis with appearance measurement , by contrast , @xmath115 ( see appendix c for definition ) vanishes not only at the best fit point but also in region around it due to the minimization in terms of @xmath30 , and no improvement of @xmath116 is obtained in the region .",
    "we did not attempt to further combine @xmath100 appearance measurement , because the sensitivity in two - flavor analysis , which can be regarded as the limiting sensitivity attainable by the present method , is already achieved with reactor measurement of @xmath6 .",
    "in the next generation lbl neutrino oscillation experiments , a precise determination of @xmath2 to a few % level is expected . in this paper , we have pointed out that , despite such marvelous sensitivities for @xmath2 , the reachable accuracy of determination of @xmath3 is only at a level of @xmath117 depending upon the true value of @xmath0 .",
    "we have identified the principal reasons for the disparity between the errors of @xmath2 and @xmath3 as due to the jacobian and the degeneracy effects .",
    "we also noticed that measurement of @xmath0 , when it goes down to such high accuracy , is started to be affected by the higher order corrections in @xmath65 in the oscillation probability .",
    "we have shown that by doing detailed quantitative analyses such three - flavor effects produce , typically , an increase of uncertainty in @xmath3 determination by @xmath118 ; @xmath5 is larger in the second octant of @xmath0 than that in the first octant .",
    "then , we have shown that by combining either reactor measurement of @xmath6 , or @xmath7 appearance measurement in lbl experiment the accuracies of @xmath0 determination can be improved to the level expected by simple two - flavor fitting ( @xmath113 ) of the measurement , the limiting sensitivity attainable by the disappearance measurement .",
    "measurement is affected by the disappearance experiment through @xmath29 and/or @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , we may need simultaneous determination of @xmath0 and @xmath6 for the most stringent bounds . while we did not go into deep into the detail on how such analysis for simultaneous determination of two angles can be done ,",
    "such a proper formulation is necessary and should be ready when the jparc - sk experiment starts .",
    "] we have to note that our simulation of data and the estimation of uncertainties were done with oa 2 degree beam , which may be slightly higher in peak energy than the one appropriate for @xmath120ev@xmath69 .",
    "it is worthwhile to repeat the analysis with more realistic oa 2.5 degree beam .",
    "finally , we want to make some remarks on importance of precise determination of the lepton flavor mixing parameters .",
    "we want to stress two viewpoints , one related to physics and the other to future neutrino experiments .    0.1 cm    \\(1 )",
    "why is precise measurement of the lepton flavor mixing parameters so important ?",
    "one of the significant features is that there are two large and small mixing angles .",
    "it is suggested that near maximal @xmath0 may imply a symmetry and @xmath0 is maximal and @xmath6 vanishes in the symmetry limit  @xcite .",
    "if it is indeed the case detecting small deviation of @xmath0 from the maximal is as important as measuring @xmath6 .",
    "confirmation of this possibility would require a few  % level determination of @xmath3 , given already severe constraint by the global analysis , @xmath121 at 3@xmath10  cl @xcite . if it turned out that @xmath6 is much smaller",
    ", it would necessitate even more accurate determination of @xmath0 .",
    "if some of the lepton and quark mixing angles are indeed `` complementary '' with each other  @xcite , there will be immense requests for precise determination of lepton mixing angles because the quark mixing angles are now measured quite accurately .",
    "this possibility may require even more precise determination of @xmath0 beyond a level expectable by current technology .",
    "keeping in mind the possibility that we finally uncover the real theory of flavor mixing in the future it is desirable , whenever opportunity exists , to pursue determination of mixing parameters as precisely as possible .",
    "notice that there is a way to measure @xmath122 to an accuracy of @xmath92 2% comparable to that of the cabibbo angle @xcite .",
    "0.1 cm    \\(2 ) how important or crucial is the precise determination of @xmath0 for future neutrino oscillation experiments ?",
    "most probably the field where precise determination of lepton mixing parameters is really necessary is the detection of leptonic cp violation , one of the ultimate goal of future neutrino experiments .",
    "it is because cp violation is a tiny effect , being suppressed by the two small numbers , one the jarlskog factor @xmath123 and the other @xmath124 .",
    "hence , it is crucial to minimize uncertainties of other mixing parameters ( as well as neutrino cross sections on the relevant nuclei ) to achieve unambiguous detection of cp violation .    in this regard , diminishing the uncertainty in @xmath0 measurement is probably one of the most important . to obtain the feeling",
    "let us suppose for simplicity that the experiment has relatively short baseline so that the vacuum oscillation approximation applies , which may be the case for the jparc - hyper - kamiokande project @xcite .",
    "let us assume that the cp asymmetry defined by @xmath125 gives a good measure for cp violation , where @xmath126 and @xmath127 denote appearance probabilities @xmath102 and @xmath128 , respectively . to simplify the equations we tune the energy at the first oscillation maximum , @xmath129 , as planned in the j - parc experiment . under these approximations ,",
    "the cp asymmetry is given by @xmath130    at the moment , of course , the uncertainty of @xmath131 is a dominating error because it has not been measured yet .",
    "but it is expected that it can be measured either by lbl or reactor experiments with errors @xmath132% if @xmath133 .",
    "the error produced by @xmath134 factor in ( [ cpasym ] ) is non - negligible compared to this error .",
    "the uncertainties estimated in sec .  [ analysis ] can be translated into @xmath135% error in @xmath134 , and hence it is large .",
    "here , it is worth to note that where the errors are relatively small the splitting of @xmath134 between two degenerate solutions of @xmath0 is large .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty in the cp asymmetry is even larger , 20 - 30% , in off the maximal region if the octant degeneracy of @xmath0 is not resolved .",
    "most likely , the error of @xmath131 is significantly reduced at the time of cp measurement because of the possibility that it is precisely determined by _ in situ _ lbl measurement employing both neutrino and antineutrino beams at the oscillation maximum ( or more precisely the shrunk ellipse limit  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of @xmath0 including the degeneracy effect may be the dominating error for cp measurement .",
    "0.1 cm    precise determination of @xmath31 , though not explicitly addressed in this paper , is an another important issue .",
    "the error is expected to be @xmath136% in the jparc - sk experiment .",
    "its precise determination is also essential in a variety of contexts ranging search for cp violation and improving bounds on mixing parameters by double beta decay experiments .    in conclusion",
    ", we stress the importance of finding alternative methods which are sensitive to @xmath35 not to @xmath137 for accurate measurement of @xmath0 .",
    "the obvious candidates include the reactor - lbl combined measurement discussed in @xcite , and high - statistics observation of atmospheric neutrinos @xcite .",
