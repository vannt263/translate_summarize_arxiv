    "we finish the section with a discussion of the simultaneous excitation of atoms into opposite zeeman states by means of the same guided optical mode @xcite . the experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite show that the atoms trapped on `` top '' of a tapered fiber preferentially make a dipolar transition of opposite angular momentum with respect to those trapped at the `` bottom '' of the fiber .",
    "we note that the intensity of the evanescent fields that interact with the two groups of trapped atoms decreases in opposite directions ( say @xmath22 and @xmath1 ) . as can be appreciated in fig .",
    "[ fig : intuition ] , this gradient reversal has the same effect as the change in propagation direction : it reverses the slopes in fig .",
    "[ fig : jyvsjz ] .",
    "it is therefore expected that the electric dipole transition of atoms on `` top '' will preferentially be of the opposite sign of transverse angular momentum than for the atoms at the `` bottom '' .",
    "this transition rate difference is of the same character as the ratio in eq .",

    "the outcomes of our symmetry based arguments are consistent with those of the microscopic theory for the forward and backward scattering of guided light from a multilevel atom developed in @xcite .",

    "[ fig : sp ] that most of the peaks in @xmath123 are due to single absorption resonances of the particle .",

    ". furthermore , absorption magnetic dipolar ( md ) and magnetic octopolar ( mo ) resonances can also be singled out , both of them being excited by the @xmath119 evanescent wave . these observations are consistent with the two main features of the expansion of te and tm evanescent plane waves .",
    "the first has been shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : jyvsjz ] : the projection of evanescent waves with multipolar modes grows exponentially with @xmath50 and @xmath8 , reaching a maximum when @xmath130 .",

    "putting all this together , we can now figure out why tm(te ) evanescent plane waves are able to efficiently excite higher order multipolar resonances of the electric ( magnetic ) parity with their maximum possible transverse angular momentum value .",
    "efficiency here must be understood as relative to excitation of lower order resonances .",
    "we note that the situation is quite different when engineering the multipolar content of a propagating beam @xcite , where the exponential growth does not happen .",
    "notably , the polarization dependent excitation of multipolar absorption resonances does not qualitatively depend on the approximation made in sec .",
    "[ sec : mietheory ] .",
    "the reason is that , under a te(tm ) illumination , the secondary interaction - reflection events between the sphere and the interface will still sum up to a field which is an eigenstate of the mirror reflection across the xz plane .",
    "this happens because the entire system , excitation - interface - sphere , has this symmetry . as argued at the end of app .",
    "[ sec : appc ] , the polarization controlled selection rule illustrated in tab .",
    "[ tab : tetm ] applies not only to plane waves , but also to general eigenstates of this particular mirror reflection .",
    "two last comments are in order .",
    "first , notice that , given a wavelength , the product @xmath131 tends to 0 for growing @xmath50 .",
    "that is , the decay of @xmath132 with @xmath50 is faster than the exponential growth of the evanescent wave coefficients @xmath133 with @xmath50 .",
    "these conditions keep the additions in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : nxmz]-[eq : nzmy ] ) finite . and last but not least , as we observe in figs .",
    "[ fig : angle]-[fig : sp ] , even though the dipolar absorption resonances of the sphere are larger than the quadrupolar ones , the torque due to evanescent plane waves turns out to be dominated by the quadrupolar orders . unlike in many other light - matter interaction situations , where the dipolar contribution of the sample predominates , the evanescent light - matter interaction changes this pattern .",
    "the decomposition of an evanescent plane wave into multipoles of well - defined transverse angular momentum has been shown to be a valuable approach to study and engineer evanescent light - matter interactions .",
    "we have shown that when this approach is applied to experiments involving evanescent light - matter couplings , it leads to their qualitative understanding and to the ability of making rigorous quantitative predictions about them .",
    "we have also shown how the approach can be used to study the transverse torque exerted by an evanescent plane wave onto a given spherical absorbing particle , and to find the parameters that maximize it ; that is , the optimal combination of frequency , angle of incidence , and polarization of the corresponding propagating plane wave undergoing total internal reflection .",
    "the physical insights that we have obtained can be traced back to the two main features of the decomposition of evanescent plane waves into transverse multipolar modes : a polarization independent exponential dominance of modes with large transverse angular momentum , and a polarization controlled parity selection rule .",
    "we have provided the derivations needed to implement the transverse multipolar decomposition of an arbitrary evanescent plane wave , thereby allowing the corresponding decomposition of any evanescent field , like for example the field around a tapered fiber .",
    "we believe that the presented approach can be of help in the study and engineering of evanescent light - matter interactions .",
