    "<S> the nnn correction to the energy band structure is not a matter of particular importance . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the nnn hopping can change appreciably the energy spectrum of surface states which appear near the boundary of a system even when the correction to the energy spectrum of bulk states is negligible . </S>",

    "<S> ( 1 ) graphene is known to have both bulk and surface states . </S>",
    "<S> the bulk states exhibit a `` relativistic '' energy band structure called the dirac cone ,  @xcite and the surface states called the edge states appear near the zigzag edge .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( 2 ) the edge states have been observed by several experimental groups ,  @xcite and a theoretical understanding of the experimental results is called for . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the nnn hopping is important to explain the experimental results .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ( 3 ) the edge states have a large density of states ( dos ) near the fermi energy , which is responsible for the fermi instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> since the dos depends on the the energy spectrum or bandwidth of the edge states , the nnn hopping is important for the appearance of many - body effects of the edge states .  </S>",
