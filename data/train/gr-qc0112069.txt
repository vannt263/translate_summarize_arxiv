    "in classical general relativity a causal particle inside the event horizon is inevitably pulled towards the center of the black hole , at least until it reaches the cauchy horizon representing a barrier to predictability @xcite . in particular , no classically relativistic particle , be it of positive or vanishing rest - mass , can escape from the black hole interior .",

    "their properties and behavior in the outer space of kerr black holes have been extensively studied @xcite , and could in part even be extended to charged kerr - newman black holes @xcite . by the symmetries of these spacetimes the equations turn out to be separable in special coordinate frames , thus being mathematically tractable to a certain extent .    in the framework of classical general relativity",
    "the examination of waves in the outer space of a black hole seemed sufficient , since the event horizon acts like a perfect semi - permeable membrane , letting in any form of energy and matter but allowing none to get out .    in the present paper",
    "we extend these considerations to the region beyond the event horizon .",
    "topologically , this means nothing particular , since the spacetime curvature remains finite in this domain and the event horizon is nothing more than a coordinate singularity .",
    "as expected , the event horizon causes a singular repulsive potential in the respective wave equations .",
    "however , more detailed examination shows the remarkable , and to our knowledge yet unmentioned , property of the potential barrier to be singular enough to prevent nearly all kinds of spin - weighted waves from tunneling through it  unless electromagnetic waves .",
    "our analysis below shows that in fact a photon inside an uncharged rotating black hole may tunnel through the event horizon to the outside region , but a graviton , a neutrino or an electron may not . if the black hole is non - rotating , no particle at all can tunnel out of it . in case of a rotating and electrically charged black hole",

    "the case of extremal rotation is considered in section [ sec - rotation ] , the mathematically not completely tractable case of massless waves in a charged reissner - nordstrm spacetime in section [ sec - rn ] , and the dirac equation in a general kerr - newman spacetime in section [ sec - dirac ] .",

    "the crucial role that rotation plays in the known cases suggests that photons may tunnel out of _ any _ rotating black hole .",
    "a very strong hint supporting this conjecture is the analysis of one of the authors @xcite , where any electromagnetic wave _ in the outer space _ of a rotating kerr - newman black hole can gain some energy from the hole .",
    "however , we still have no such hints for gravitons .",
    "for the case of extremal rotation , @xmath260 , any particle can tunnel out of the black hole .",
    "because of the cosmic censorship hypothesis ( [ ccc ] ) , @xmath2 vanishes necessarily in this case .",
    "there is only the restriction on the separation constant @xmath47 given by ( [ lambda - sm - extremal ] ) to be an even integer .",
    "whether such an integer exists at all depends on the sturm - liouville equation for @xmath43 , ( [ angular equation ] ) or ( [ angular dirac ] ) , respectively .",
    "mathematically , in case of @xmath30 or @xmath261 a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurence of the tunnel phenomenon is the vanishing of @xmath262 , the factor of the first derivative in the radial wave equations , and of the function @xmath140 , cf .",

    "this condition yields a potential with an order-1 pole at the event horizon @xmath16 @xmath36 @xmath145 , see figure [ fig - pot ] .     the real and imaginary part of @xmath108 for @xmath264 , @xmath30 , @xmath265 , @xmath266 , @xmath161 ; also plotted is the constant @xmath267 .",

    "a wave packet inside the black hole with nonvanishing outgoing amplitude @xmath94 then reaches the outer space with nonvanishing amplitude @xmath92 ; if , e.g. , @xmath94 is known at @xmath178 and @xmath272 , the outside amplitude is given by ( [ conservation - law ] ) with @xmath273 .    where does this all lead us to ?",
    "notably , the tunnel phenomenon studied in this paper is a semiclassical phenomenon .",
    "this implies that the black hole gravitational field has to be strong enough compared to the typical energy of the wave field such that it does not perturb the curvature essentially , i.e.  such that it is a test field .",
    "the tunnel phenomenon seems to be related to another semiclassical phenomenon , the hawking radiation .",
    "but whereas the hawking radiation is a black hole thermodynamical effect occuring in particular for static black holes , the tunneling only exists in case of rotation . as such it resembles the classical superradiance effect , but this affects only , and all , particles with integer spin .",
    "a complete theory of quantum gravity must include the tunnel phenomenon  and should explain it .",
    "especially the puzzles concerning gravitons and photons in charged rotating black holes should be solved . to date , the most promising candidate for a theory of quantum gravity is m - theory . it has made strong progress in the last few years , not only with respect to black hole phenomena .",
    "one of the most remarkable aspects in this context certainly is the deduction of the notion of entropy of a black hole @xcite .",
    "however , to our knowledge the analysis of rotating black holes , be they uncharged or charged , in m - theory is still missing .    to conclude , rotation in general relativity over and over again reveals surprising phenomena , a fact which is not only demonstrated by @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite .",
    "succeeding in integrating rotation in m - theory would give deep insight ."
