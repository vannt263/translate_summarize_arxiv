    "the realization that meson - exchange currents play a vital role in the description of the low - energy pp - bremsstrahlung observables has consequences which are only now coming to be understood .",
    "for example , the traditional objective of pp - bremsstrahlung investigations , as indicated in fig .  1 , centers on the capacity of experiment to differentiate the accuracy of the off - shell @xmath10-matrices that are predicted by a range of model - dependent nn - interactions .",
    "this is now recognized @xcite as an exceedingly difficult task and , at best , is contingent on a completely reliable and consistent description of the associated meson - exchange currents . as such",
    ", a meaningful calculation of the pp - bremsstrahlung observables requires knowledge of the meson - baryon form factors , meson - exchange currents and the nn - interaction within a fully consistent and microscopic effective theory .    recognizing the importance of exchange currents in pp - bremsstrahlung implies a complete departure form the conventional approach to the problem and considerably changes the nature of such investigation . for many years pp - bremsstrahlung",
    "was regarded as something of a special case in nuclear physics because both meson - exchange currents and relativistic effects were expected to be small .",
    "the principle reason for this expectation stems from the fact that gauge invariance demands the real photon couples only to conserved currents , so that the n - body parts of the complete hadronic current @xmath15}$ ]    to 2.75 true in    3 true mm    for any given nn - interaction @xmath16 must satisfy , @xmath17",

    "the isospin structure of the exchange currents @xmath19}$ ] for isovector mesons ( @xmath8,@xmath20 , .. ) then reduces to @xmath21 , which vanishes in isospin conserving processes like pp - bremsstrahlung .",
    "relativistic processes can also expected to be small since the dominant @xmath8-exchange contributions to the n@xmath22-pair creation and annihilation amplitudes share this isospin structure .",
    "finally , all nn@xmath23 couplings with meson - recoil terms can be neglected since they are exactly canceled by the corresponding wave function re - orthonormalization contributions @xcite .",
    "all of this information suggests that a static limit description of pp - bremsstrahlung involves only the photon coupling to one of the protons either before and/or after ( but not during ) strong interaction .",
    "the leading - order exchange currents , according to this analysis , begin with the @xmath24 ( 549  mev ) , @xmath25 ( 782  mev ) and @xmath26 ( 975  mev ) iso - scalar mesons , and can therefore be reasonably neglected .",
    "however , the above analysis is flawed for several reasons . even within the static limit",
    "there are purely transverse currents @xmath27 which automatically satisfy @xmath28 = 0 , so that current conservation places no constraints on the manifestly gauge invariant @xmath2 , @xmath3 and n@xmath29 exchange currents shown in fig .  2 .",
    "none of these two - body currents can be included simply by introducing the commutators shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) , yet they all possess non - vanishing isoscalar contributions which can be important in pp - bremsstrahlung .",
    "in addition , as new experiments have succeeded in selecting kinematics that escape the consequences of the low - energy theorems @xcite and on - shell expansions @xcite , they necessarily emphasize dynamics where the ( usually dominant ) nucleon - pole contributions of fig .",
    "1(a - c ) are heavily suppressed by the greens functions accompanying the highly off - shell @xmath10-matrix . as such ,",
    "otherwise less important contributions gain considerable significance in the observables .",
    "this shows that the pp - bremsstrahlung dynamics involves much more than the off - shell @xmath10-matrix and the impulse current , and appears to share the complexity of other observables like np - bremsstrahlung and @xmath30 .    a very long list of pp - bremsstrahlung calculations",
    "have been reported over the last 45 years .",
    "we will make no attempt to review them all since more recent works @xcite already contain appropriate citation and serve to remove a number of questionable approximations .",
    "a notable exception to this trend is found in the very detailed @xmath31-space calculations reported some 25 years ago by brown @xcite , where the rescattering amplitudes of fig .",
    "1(c ) were retained and eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) was used to constrain the longitudinal meson - exchange currents .",
    "noteworthy calculations since that time have generally been less complete , but find their merit in the application of more reliable nn - interactions and the exploration of coulomb corrections @xcite and relativistic corrections to the impulse current @xcite .",
    "to 5.00 true in    3 true mm    only a few of the most recent pp - bremsstrahlung calculations @xcite attempt a significant improvement on the standard set by brown , although there are important technical differences in these works that we will need to consider .    in the present work we will subject the ruhrpot description of meson - baryon interactions to the test of reproducing the pp - bremsstrahlung data below the @xmath8-production threshold .",
    "the reasons for selecting this effective theory are    * a microscopic definition of the strong form factors is available from non - perturbative and self - consistent calculation @xcite .",
    "the results are compatible with skyrme@xcite , non - topological soliton @xcite and bag - model @xcite calculations , and moreover , with an analysis of experiment @xcite . *",
    "an nn - interaction model using calculated ( not fitted ) form factors has been constructed and gives an excellent description of the world data for the nn - scattering phase shifts @xcite .",
    "* the extension to include meson - exchange currents in the calculation of observables introduces no free parameters whatsoever @xcite . *",
    "a parameter free - extension of the model to define the 3-body interaction has been shown to provide an accurate description of the triton bonding energy @xcite .",
    "we indicate the relationships between the form factors , the nn interaction and the exchange currents in fig .  3 .",
    "although such consistent calculations can ( in principle ) be performed for any effective meson field theory , such work has so far only been completed for the ruhrpot description and it appears that there are severe difficulties in obtaining similar consistency in other models .",
    "for example , the ruhrpot form factor calculations have been modified to adopt the coupling constants of a conventional boson - exchange nn interaction and yield results @xcite which can be accurately parameterized as monopoles with typical regularization scales of @xmath32  gev . while consistency demands the use of such form factors , conventional boson - exchange models require@xcite artificial scales ( ` cut - offs ' ) of @xmath33  gev and @xmath34  gev",
    ". such an artificial description of the meson - nucleon vertices necessarily frustrates any attempt to obtain a realistic description of the meson - exchange currents and the 3n interaction .",
    "to 3.25 true in    3 true mm    coupled channel @xmath10-matrices providing a non - perturbative description of all possible transitions between nn , @xmath13n and @xmath14 states have been available for more than 25 years @xcite and have already been used to calculate the @xmath13-isobar contributions to pp - bremsstrahlung observables @xcite . under these circumstances",
    "it may appear curious that we choose to develop a perturbative description of the n@xmath29 @xmath0 and @xmath35 exchange currents .",
    "however , the coupled channel @xmath10-matrices used in recent pp - bremsstrahlung calculations are obtained by the inconsistent combination of the paris @xcite nn@xmath9nn and a static limit version of the ried - parameterized bochum @xcite nn@xmath36n interaction .",
    "it is therefore impossible to accurately remove the double counted two - pion exchange amplitudes with intermediate n@xmath13 states , so a free parameter is introduced to permit an approximate subtraction procedure . as such , this approach discards from the outset any hope of a obtaining a microscopic description and the quality of the results must be interpreted in terms of a meaningless parameter .",
    "we will later show that , even if these inconsistencies were to be resolved by fully consistent calculation , such an approach is contingent upon a reliable description of boost operators , as well as ( a subset of ) the relativistic meson - exchange currents that will be developed in this work .    in the present work",
    "we develop our earlier description @xcite of the ruhrpot meson - baryon interactions in the pp - bremsstrahlung data below the @xmath8-production threshold . in refs",
    "@xcite we included the relativistic single and rescattering impulse - current amplitudes , and in refs  @xcite we introduced the fully relativistic description of the radiative vector - meson decay currents and the non - relativistic description of the n@xmath29 @xmath0 and @xmath35meson exchange currents without recourse to the soft - photon approximation . in the present work",
    "we investigate a number of important extensions .",
    "in particular , after describing our model - independent formalism in sec  [ sec2 ] , we provide in sec  [ sec3 ] the first bremsstrahlung calculations including a fully relativistic description of the wave function re - orthonormalization and meson - recoil currents that are required to ensure the orthonormality of the wave functions is preserved .",
    "we also investigate the lorentz structure of the nn@xmath8 vertex by providing the first calculations for the purely relativistic n@xmath22 pair creation and annihilation currents .",
    "we further present relativistic expressions for the n@xmath29 @xmath0 and @xmath35exchange currents and identify the source of error in various approximations . supporting calculation details",
    "are supplied in the three appendices . in sec",
    "[ sec4 ] , after establishing the sensitivity of the selected pp - bremsstrahlung observables to each of these currents and concluding that a relativistic calculation of the isobar amplitudes is necessary , we compare our relativistic results with the complete data set available from the 1990 triumf pp - bremsstrahlung experiment @xcite .",
    "we obtain a good description of the experimental data and conclude that a large pseudoscalar admixture in the nn@xmath8 lagrangian is ruled out .",
    "further conclusions and future objectives are given in sec  [ sec5 ] .",
    "we begin by presenting the model independent expressions we require for the calculation observables for the reaction @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38matrix from covariant perturbation theory @xmath39 gives the probability amplitude for a transition @xmath40 as a series involving 0,1,@xmath41 interactions where the photon field @xmath42 couples to the hadronic current density @xmath43 .",
    "since only terms with an odd number of electromagnetic interactions can contribute to the production of a single real photon , and each of these diminishes by @xmath44 , we retain only the lowest - order contribution and define the transition amplitude as , @xmath45 following a well trodden path , we integrate the transition amplitude over the phase space available to the final state , and divide by the incident flux , so that with plane wave normalized to a @xmath46-function , we obtain the lab - frame differential cross section as , @xmath47 where , for the pp- and nn - bremsstrahlung reactions we have    @xmath48 and for np - bremsstrahlung we require , @xmath49    2 with the invariant amplitude given by , @xmath50^{1/2 }    { \\cal t}_{fi}\\ ] ] we retain only the transverse polarization vectors for the real photon since , within the gupta - bleuler quantization formalism , the longitudinal and scalar components can be made to cancel with a gauge transformation , and therefore can not effect the observables . the ` phase - space factor ' @xmath51 appearing in eq  ( [ eq2.3 ] ) is defined for arbitrary non - coplanarity @xmath52 as , @xmath53 with @xmath54   \\nonumber \\\\ & - &       k\\sin^2\\theta_\\gamma     \\bigl ( \\beta_3\\cos\\theta_4 - \\beta_4\\cos\\theta_3 \\bigr )   \\nonumber \\\\ & + &       2 \\sin\\theta_3 \\sin\\theta_4 \\sin^2\\phi     \\bigl [      \\bigl ( p_3\\cos\\theta_3 - p_4\\cos\\theta_4 \\bigr )   \\nonumber \\\\ & & -     \\bigl ( p_3\\beta_3 - p_4\\beta_4 \\bigr ) \\cos\\theta_\\gamma       \\bigr ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we use @xmath55=@xmath56 for laboratory - frame reaction kinematics @xmath57 .",
    "we realize that in the limit @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is guaranteed , @xmath60 possesses singularities but @xmath61 remains well defined .",
    "our description of kinematics and phase space is the same as that reported in the detailed discussion of ref  @xcite . as such , it is sufficient to note that in ref  @xcite it was shown that @xmath51 possess a square root singularity at the kinematic limit of non - coplanarity , although in the present work we avoid the non - relativistic simplifications discussed therein .    for the calculation of polarized observables",
    "it is convenient to denote @xmath62 as the cross section of eq  ( [ eq2.3 ] ) measured with the beam polarized in the @xmath63 direction .",
    "we choose the quantization axis as the beam direction in the lab frame , and define the vector analyzing powers as , @xmath64}{\\cal m}_{fi}^\\dagger\\bigr\\ } \\over \\sum_{t_i t_f\\lambda}\\hbox{tr } \\bigl\\ { { \\cal m}_{fi } { \\cal m}_{fi}^\\dagger \\bigr\\ } } \\ ] ] where @xmath65 or @xmath66 in the lab frame .",

    "so that after making use of translational invariance and selecting the lorentz - heaviside system with natural units , eq  ( [ eq2.6 ] ) can be recast as , @xmath71 where the field - theoretic hadronic current is given by , @xmath72 for the lagrangian @xmath73 describing electromagnetic interactions with the interacting meson - baryon system . direct calculation of eq .",
    "( [ eq2.11 ] ) is impossible since @xmath74 and @xmath75 represent complete meson - baryon states and therefore involve nucleon , resonance and meson degrees of freedom to infinite order .",
