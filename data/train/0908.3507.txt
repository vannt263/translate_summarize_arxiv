    "the state is very wide , and pion electroproduction data covering a large range in the invariant mass w with full center - of - mass angular coverage are key in extracting the transition form factors . as an isospin @xmath15 state , the @xmath16 couples more strongly to n@xmath17 than to p@xmath18 .",
    "also contributions of the high energy tail of the @xmath2 are much reduced in that channel due to the @xmath19 nature of the @xmath2 .",

    "the first uncertainty is due to the branching ratio of the coupling @xmath34 .",
    "the pdg  @xcite gives ranges of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , which adds a large uncertainty to the resulting helicity amplitudes .",
    "since this state has very small coupling to channels other than @xmath32 and @xmath37 , a measurement of the reaction @xmath38 can reduce this uncertainty .",
    "adjusting @xmath39 and @xmath40 brings the two data sets into excellent agreement , as shown in fig .",
    "the second uncertainty comes from the lack of precise information on the longitudinal coupling .",
    "this contribution is usually neglected when analyzing the @xmath30 channel .",
    "an important advantage of the @xmath37 channel is that it is also sensitive to the longitudinal transition amplitude @xmath24 resulting from a significant @xmath41 wave interference with the nearby @xmath42-wave amplitude of the @xmath16 .",
    "since the @xmath16 does not couple to @xmath30 , this channel has very little sensitivity to the @xmath24 amplitude .",
    "a longstanding prediction  @xcite of the dynamical constituent quark model is the helicity switch from the dominance of the @xmath44 amplitude at the photon point to @xmath23 dominance at @xmath45  gev@xmath9 .",
    "indications of such behavior have been observed in previous analysis  @xcite , but analyses have been hampered by incomplete kinematical coverage of data , and the scarceness of @xmath21 data , which are most sensitive to the excitation of the state .",

    "the past decade of experimental research on the electroproduction of pseudoscalar mesons , has led to consistent set of data on transition amplitudes for several of the lower mass excited states of the nucleon .",
    "this set of the most precise amplitudes to date allows us to put to test models of the nucleon structure in terms of the effective degrees of freedom .",
