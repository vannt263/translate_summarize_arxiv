    "the detection of @xmath0-mode polarization from gravitational wave mode perturbation has been reported by bicep2  @xcite . from the amplitude of the tensor perturbation ,",
    "the tensor - to - scalar ratio is read as @xmath1 for a lensed-@xmath2cdm plus tensor mode cosmological model , @xmath3 after the foreground subtraction based on dust models .",
    "those values appear to be under the tension with the upper bound @xmath4 reported by the planck  @xcite . as a possible way to resolve this tension , in ref .  @xcite the introduction of a large negative running of the scalar spectral index has been proposed .",
    "however , we note that after the bicep2 paper  @xcite , doubts about inappropriate treatments on dust emissions in their analysis have been raised  @xcite .",
    "the planck collaboration have released the polarized dust emission data away from galactic plane  @xcite , the joint analysis of bicep2 and the planck dust polarization data found no evidence  @xcite .",
    "the large tensor mode has a remarkable implication to inflation .",
    "such a large tensor mode can be generated in the so - called large field inflation models , where the field value of inflaton during inflation takes super - plankian , while small field inflation models can not generate large @xmath5 , but @xmath6",
    "thus , since the bicep2 results were announced , polynomial chaotic inflation models have been studied intensively in light of the bicep2 data  @xcite . however , the construction of so - called large field model looks nontrivial from supergravity viewpoint as well as field theoretical viewpoint . for various attempts , see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite .    in this respect ,",
    "hybrid inflation is appealing since the inflaton @xmath7 takes a field value less than or of the order of planck scale  @xcite .",
    "however generally speaking , hybrid inflation models have been disfavored .",
    "firstly , while simple ( non-)supersymmetric hybrid inflation predicts the density perturbation with the scalar spectral index @xmath8  @xcite  , non - minimal kahler potentials have been examined  @xcite . ] , the wmap  @xcite and planck  @xcite data indicate @xmath9 . secondly , topological defects , usually cosmic strings , are formed at the end of a hybrid inflation , when the water fall field develops the vacuum expectation value ( vev ) .",
    "the expected mass per unit length of the formed cosmic string is not compatible with data of the temperature anisotropy @xmath10 in the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmb )  @xcite .",
    "thirdly , hybrid inflation can not generate gravitational wave mode with a large amplitude  @xcite because the potential energy scale is too low , in other word the potential is too flat when we normalize the amplitude of the density ( scalar ) perturbation with @xmath10 .",
    "we point out a possible way to overcome those problems of hybrid inflation .",
    "the second problem due to cosmic strings is avoided by considering somewhat complicated potential such as shifted hybrid inflation  @xcite or smooth hybrid inflation  @xcite .",
    "the other two can be simultaneously solved if we give up a large enough number of e - folds @xmath11 by a hybrid inflation to solve problems in the standard big bang cosmology .",
    "a smaller @xmath11 corresponds to a larger slow roll parameters , which leads to a smaller @xmath12 and a larger @xmath5 .",
    "of course , we need to solve the horizon and flatness problems and generate the density perturbation at super - horizon scales .",
    "this may be achieved by an inflation following after the hybrid inflation , so - called double inflation scenario , where the universe has undergone an inflationary expansion in the early universe more than once .",
    "such double inflation scenarios  @xcite have been considered with various motivations , e.g. , low multipole anomaly in the cmb sky  @xcite , the generation of primordial black holes  @xcite , and the dilution of unwanted relics  @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we show if the secondary inflation takes place with a sufficient number of e - folds , say @xmath13 , a kind of supersymmetric hybrid inflation is available and could generate not only an appropriate density perturbation and its spectrum as in ref .",
    "@xcite but also large @xmath14 , in contrast with the previous work  @xcite where the possibility of @xmath15 has been pointed out .",
    "here , at first , we note several formulas used in the following analysis .",
    "the power spectrum of the density perturbation , the scalar spectral index , its running and the tensor - to - scalar ratio are expressed as @xmath16 respectively by using the potential @xmath17 and slow roll parameters @xmath18 in the unit of @xmath19 . here",
    ", @xmath7 is the canonically normalized inflaton field , a subscript @xmath7 and dot denote derivatives with respect to @xmath7 and time respectively , and @xmath20 is the hubble parameter .",
    "the motivation of the supersymmetric ( f - term ) hybrid inflation is to realize the inflation model through gauge symmetry breaking in supersymmetric grand unified theories , e.g. with gauge groups @xmath21 such as @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , although here we do not concentrate on a specific gauge group @xmath21 .",
    "the superpotential for the simplest supersymmetric hybrid inflation  @xcite is given by @xmath25 with @xmath26 being a yukawa coupling .",
    "here , @xmath27 is a gauge singlet superfield and @xmath28 and @xmath29 are charged superfields , which have representations conjugate to each other under @xmath21 . when @xmath28 and @xmath29 develop their vevs , the gauge symmetry is broken .",
    "although the above superpotential is simple and inflation can be realized , this simple hybrid inflation suffers from the stringent constraint on the tension of cosmic strings generated at the end of inflation .",
    "shifted hybrid inflation  @xcite is an attractive alternative which is free from cosmic string problem , because the symmetry of the water fall field is already broken during inflation .",
    "nevertheless the field dynamics is same as in the minimal hybrid inflation .",
    "thus , in the following analysis , we accept shifted hybrid inflation model .",
    "the superpotential for shifted inflation is given by @xmath30 the scalar potential is written as @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes the @xmath33-term potential of @xmath21 .",
    "the scalar potential @xmath17 is rewritten as @xmath34 by imposing the @xmath33-flat condition @xmath35 .",
    "the supersymmetric global minimum is located at @xmath36 if the following condition @xmath37 is satisfied . in this vacuum ,",
    "the masses of the inflaton @xmath27 and the second field @xmath38 are given by @xmath39 stationary points of this potential with respect to @xmath38 are given by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is given by @xmath42 the squared root term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ def : phipm ] ) can be real only for @xmath43 or @xmath44 if @xmath45 is satisfied .    as can be seen in fig .  [",
    "fig : potential ] , for large @xmath46 region , the potential has three local minima at @xmath47 separated by two local maxima at @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "we consider the case that the inflaton slow rolls in the inflation valley at @xmath50 during inflation in order not to produce topological defects .",
    "as @xmath46 decreases , the local maximum @xmath49 approaches the valley and coincides with it at @xmath51 then , @xmath38 starts to fall into the @xmath52 minimum .    due to supersymmetry breaking during inflation , radiative corrections to",
    "the scalar potential @xmath53 appears for @xmath54 in terms of the canonical inflaton @xmath55 .",
    "in addition , supergravity effects also lift the potential . in total",
    ", we consider the scalar potential @xmath56,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the third term in the right - hand side is a dominant supergravity effect .",
    "the ellipsis represents higher order supergravity corrections , but in the following analysis we assume those terms are not significant for inflationary dynamics . note that this is the same form as that of the standard supersymmetric hybrid inflation .",
    "the slow roll parameters are expressed as @xmath57 we substitute eqs .",
    "( [ eta : sigma ] ) - ( [ xi : sigma ] ) and the solution of @xmath58 during inflation @xmath59 with @xmath11 being the number of e - folds and @xmath60 being the final field value where the slow roll parameter @xmath61 becomes @xmath62 and inflation terminates , for eqs .",
    "( [ formula : ns ] ) - ( [ formula : rt ] ) .",
    "then , we obtain values of slow roll parameters .",
    "the amplitude of the density perturbation provides the normalization of the potential height @xmath63 .    in figs .",
    "[ fig:50 ] - [ fig:6 ] , we show the resultant inflationary perturbation indices for various @xmath11s in the @xmath64 plane . the blue , red and green lines are contours of @xmath65 , and @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively .",
    "a green line does not appear if the value of @xmath68 is very small . dashed and dotted lines are used to indicate the supergravity correction contribution to the total scalar potential @xmath69 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively . in the region above the dashed line , the false vacuum energy contribution to the total scalar potential is not dominant and the model reduces to the chaotic inflation - like .",
    "gray lines are the contour of the field value of @xmath58 for each @xmath11 .",
    "figure  [ fig:50 ] is for @xmath72 , which is large enough to solve the horizon and flatness problems only by this inflation .",
    "the region of the @xmath73 and a small @xmath26 is the most well studied part , which predicts the well known results @xmath74 and negligible @xmath5 . on the other hand , although the large @xmath75 region appears to predict large @xmath5 and @xmath9 , this actually corresponds to the usual quadratic chaotic inflation where the false vacuum potential energy is negligible and the field value is of @xmath76 .",
    "next , we present the @xmath11 dependence by showing @xmath77 case in fig .",
    "[ fig:20 ] . by comparing the previous @xmath72 and the next @xmath78 cases",
    ", one can see the prediction changes as @xmath11 is varied .",
    "since @xmath11 is reduced , the slow roll parameters increase . as a result ,",
    "for a given @xmath26 and @xmath75 , @xmath12 becomes smaller and @xmath5 becomes larger .",
    "however , for @xmath79 , again the false vacuum energy is not dominant .",
    "now , we consider the case that the observed cosmological scale corresponds to @xmath78 in the hybrid inflation , shown in fig .  [ fig:10 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath9 and @xmath80 are realized for @xmath81 , the running is small though . here",
    "it is clear to see such a large @xmath5 is obtained even if the false vacuum energy is dominated .    finally , in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , we present a case with @xmath82 , where @xmath83 is obtained for @xmath84 .",
    "this offers a resolution of the tension between bicep2 ( @xmath85 ) and planck ( @xmath86 ) due to the large enough running @xmath87   with a supergravity correction of nonvanishing @xmath75 , a large running @xmath87 and wide range of @xmath12 can be obtained .",
    "this is essentially same manner as in ref .",
    "@xcite to reconcile the first indication of a large running by wmap(2003 )  @xcite . ] .      as we have seen in the previous subsection",
    ", we can obtain @xmath9 and @xmath14 , if the cosmological scale @xmath88 corresponds to @xmath89 of the hybrid inflation . since this short inflation can not solve the cosmological problems in the standard big bang cosmology , we need additional inflationary expansion with the number of e - folds about @xmath90 . in principle , any inflation can play a role of this .",
    "the double inflation scenario by employing the second low scale small field inflation model has been investigated many time in literature , for instance , referred in introduction .",
    "this is one possible scenario . for superpotentials for small field inflation ,",
    "see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite . during and after hybrid inflation , due to the supersymmetry breaking effects by the inflaton of the hybrid inflation and supergravity effects",
    ", the initial condition for the second small field inflation can be set  @xcite .",
    "after the energy densities of the oscillating @xmath58 and @xmath38 decreased and the potential energy for the second inflation dominates , the second inflation can take place .",
    "then , the desired additional number of e - fold and an acceptable amplitude of density perturbation can be obtained by tuning the potential curvature ( see e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    as mentioned in the introduction , thermal inflation driven by a flaton , which would be identified with a flat direction in a supersymmetric model , is also a candidate of sequel inflation  @xcite . in this case ,",
    "@xmath58 and @xmath38 reheat the universe once and the thermal effect sets the initial condition for thermal inflation . after the cosmic temperature drops ,",
    "the potential energy of the flaton induces the thermal inflation .",
    "in this paper , we have examined the possibility of viable hybrid inflation generating a large tensor - to - scalar ratio as bicep2 indicated .",
    "the result is that it is possible if an additional inflation follows the hybrid inflation whose number of e - fold is not large enough to solve the horizon and flatness problems , which is crucial and essential assumption",
    ". provided the additional inflation successfully works , the observed cosmological scale would correspond to a few @xmath91 of the hybrid inflation . in this case ,",
    "@xmath9 and @xmath14 can be realized at the cosmological scale .",
    "one observation here is that if we work on double inflation scenario , we do not need super - planckian field value of the inflaton . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:10 ] and [ fig:6 ] , the order of planck field value is sufficient .",
    "another feature is that a large negative @xmath87 can be obtained for @xmath92 .",
    "this would offer a possibility to resolve the tension between bicep2 and planck .    in double inflation scenario , the present large scale exits the hubble horizon during the high scale hybrid inflation and the small scale does during the following low scale inflation .",
    "hence , a cosmological implication of double inflation is strong scale dependence of amplitude of gravitational wave mode .",
