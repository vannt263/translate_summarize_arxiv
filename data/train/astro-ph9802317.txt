    "in the context of the hot big bang cosmology , if the number of light - neutrino species has its standard value @xmath17 , the predicted primordial abundances of four light nuclides ( d , @xmath18he , @xmath13he , and @xmath19li ) depend on only one free parameter , @xmath0 , the universal ratio ( at present ) of nucleons ( baryons ) to photons ( in units @xmath20 ) . in principle , @xmath0 is overdetermined by the observed or inferred primordial abundances of the four light nuclides .",
    "indeed , steigman , schramm , and gunn ( 1977 ) have exploited this fact to use big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) to constrain @xmath21 .",
    "the status quo ante is that observations , principally of d and @xmath13he , have rendered @xmath0 one of the best known of the key cosmological parameters : @xmath0 = @xmath22 ( walker , 1991 ; the error bars being roughly `` 1@xmath23 '' ) .    at present ,",
    "when the microwave background temperature @xmath24 = 2.728 k ( fixsen , 1996 ) , the universal baryonic mass - density parameter @xmath25 is related to @xmath0 by @xmath26 however , recently there have emerged reasons to suspect that @xmath0 may not be so well determined , and even that the standard theory of bbn may not provide a very good fit to the current data ( hata , 1995 ) .",
    "there are several options available for resolving this apparent conflict between theory and observation .",
    "although some change in standard physics could offer resolution ( e.g. , a reduction in the effective value of @xmath21 during bbn below its standard value 3 ; cf .",
    "hata , 1995 ) , hata  ( 1995 ) note that large systematic errors may compromise the abundance data ( cf .",
    "copi , schramm , and turner , 1995 )",
    ".    this controversy has been sharpened by new observations giving the deuterium abundances on various lines of sight to high - redshift qsos . in principle",
    ", these data should yield the primordial d abundance , but current results span an order of magnitude . if the low value ( d / h by number @xmath27 ; tytler , fan , and burles , 1996 ; burles and tytler , 1996 ) is correct , then @xmath28 in the standard model , but then it seems impossible to reconcile the inferred abundance of @xmath13he [ olive and steigman , 1995 ( os ) ] with ( standard ) bbn for this value of @xmath0 unless there are large systematic errors in the @xmath13he data .",
    "if , instead , the high figures ( d / h @xmath29 ; carswell , 1994 ; songaila , 1994 ; rugers and hogan , 1996 ) are correct , then d and @xmath13he are consistent with @xmath30 , but modellers of galactic chemical evolution have a major puzzle : how has the galaxy reduced d from its high primordial value to its present ( local ) low value without producing too much @xmath18he ( steigman and tosi , 1995 ) , without using up too much interstellar gas ( edmunds , 1994 ; prantzos , 1996 ) , and without overproducing heavy elements ( cf .",
    "tosi , 1996 , and references therein ) ?",
    "it appears that @xmath0 , though known to order of magnitude , may now be among the less well - known cosmological parameters . despite this , large modern simulations which explore other cosmological parameters are often limited to a single value of @xmath31 ( e.g. , borgani , 1997 ) .    given this unsettled situation steigman , hata , and felten ( 1997",
    "; hereafter shf ) have proposed that it may be constructive to abandon nucleosynthetic constraints on @xmath0 entirely and to put @xmath0 onto the same footing as the other cosmological free parameters , applying joint constraints on all these parameters based on other ( non - bbn ) astronomical observations and on theory and simulation .",
    "armed with @xmath0 determined in this manner we may then  predict \" the primordial abundances of the light nuclides and compare with the data to test the consistency of standard bbn . in this contribution to the proceedings of the issi workshop on primordial nuclei and their galactic evolution ( bern , switzerland ,",
    "610 may 1997 ) we present a brief description of our approach along with a summary of our results for a  standard \" ( fiducial ) choice of the observational constraints . for further details ( especially of the many variations on the standard case to be described herein ) and references the reader is encouraged to consult shf .",
    "our approach is to let the three key cosmological parameters ( @xmath1 ) range freely , fit the constraints ( observables other than nucleosynthetic ) to be described below , test goodness of fit by @xmath32 , and draw formal confidence regions for the parameters by the usual @xmath7 method .",
    "most of the shf results are not surprising , and related work has been done before ( white , 1996 ; lineweaver , 1997 ; white and silk , 1996 ; bludman , 1997 ) , but not with these three free variables and the full @xmath32 formalism .",
    "further , some recent cosmological observations and simulations , particularly those related to the `` shape parameter '' @xmath33 and the cluster baryon fraction ( cbf ) , seem to pose a challenge to popular models , and there is some doubt whether any simple model presently fits all data well . our approach , which begins by discarding nucleosynthetic constraints , provides a new way of looking at these problems . for example , the cbf and @xmath33 constraints have not been applied jointly in earlier work which often also adopts a precise value for @xmath0 ( or @xmath34 ) .    shf find that , given their conservative ( generous ) choice of error bar on @xmath35 , the scdm model is disfavored but by no means excluded .",
    "but even with this generous error bar , large values @xmath36 of @xmath0 ( @xmath37 ) are favored strongly over low values ( @xmath12 ; @xmath38 @xmath39 ) .",
    "this suggests that the low d abundances measured by tytler  ( 1996 ) and by burles and tytler ( 1996 ) may be correct , and that the observed ( extrapolated ) primordial helium-4 mass fraction [ @xmath40 ; cf .",
    "os and olive , skillman , and steigman , 1997 ( oss ) ] , thought to be well determined , may be systematically too low for unknown reasons .",
    "the cdm models we consider are defined by three free parameters : hubble parameter @xmath35 ; mass - density parameter @xmath41 ; and baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath0 , related to @xmath34 by equation  ( [ eq : omega_b ] ) . here",
    "@xmath14 by definition includes all `` dynamical mass '' : mass which behaves dynamically like ordinary matter in the universal expansion ; @xmath14 is not limited to clustered mass only .",
    "other free parameters having to do with structure formation , such as the tilt parameter @xmath42 , could be added ( white , 1996 ; kolatt and dekel , 1997 ; white and silk , 1996 ) , but generally we have tried to avoid introducing many free parameters .",
    "we consider four observables ( constraints ) with measured values and with errors which are assumed to be gaussian : ( 1 ) hubble parameter @xmath2 ; ( 2 ) age of the universe @xmath3 ; ( 3 ) gas - mass fraction @xmath43 in rich clusters ; and ( 4 ) `` shape parameter '' @xmath5 from structure studies .",
    "in shf we considered a fifth constraint : the dynamical mass - density parameter @xmath44 as inferred from cluster measurements or from large - scale flows . here , we ignore this constraint but we shall comment on its relation to our  standard \" results .      for the hubble parameter",
    "the observable @xmath2 is simply fit with the parameter @xmath35 .",
    "measurements of @xmath35 still show scatter which is large compared with their formal error estimates ( bureau , mould , and staveley - smith , 1996 ; tonry , 1997 ; kundi , 1997 ; tammann and federspiel , 1997 ) .",
    "this indicates systematic errors . to be conservative",
    "( permissive ) , we adopt @xmath45 .",
    "perhaps a smaller error could be justified ; below we will comment on the consequences of shrinking the error bar .",
    "the age for these @xmath46 models is a function of @xmath35 and @xmath14 given by : @xmath47=0 ) gyr [ weinberg , 1972 , equations ( 15.3.11 ) & ( 15.3.20 ) ] .",
    "we take the observed age of the oldest globular clusters as @xmath48 gyr ( bolte and hogan , 1995 ; jimenez , 1997 ; dantona , caloi , and mazzitelli , 1997 ; chaboyer , 1997 ; cowan , 1997 ; cf . nittler and cowsik , 1997 ) .",
    "the universe is older than the oldest globular clusters by an unknown amount @xmath49 .",
    "although most theorists believe that @xmath49 must be quite small ( 1 or 2 gyr at most ) , we are unaware of any conclusive argument which guarantees this . to keep things simple , shf introduced asymmetric error bars : @xmath50 gyr , allowing enough extra parameter space at large ages to accommodate a conservative range of @xmath49 ; extremely large ages will be eliminated by the @xmath2 constraint in any case .      as is suggested by simulations",
    ", we assume that rich clusters provide a fairly unbiased sample of * the universal ratio of baryonic to dark matter*. thus , we use the cluster ( hot ) gas fraction , @xmath52 , not as a constraint on @xmath14 , but as a constraint on the universal baryon fraction , the ratio @xmath53 .",
    "we emphasize that the following argument assumes that rich clusters provide a fair sample of the universal baryon fraction but does * not * assume that most of the mass in the universe , or any specific fraction of it , is in rich clusters .",
    "the measurement of @xmath52 poses some problems ; for discussion and references , see shf .",
    "we have followed the approach of evrard , metzler , and navarro ( 1996 ) , who used gas - dynamical simulations to model the observations .",
    "they find that the largest contribution to the error in @xmath52 arises from the measurement of the cluster s _ total _ mass , and they suggest that this error can be reduced by using an improved estimator and by restricting the measurement to regions of fairly high overdensity .",
    "evrard ( 1997 ) applies these methods to data for real clusters and finds @xmath54 . to be conservative ,",
    "we double his error bars and adopt for our constraint @xmath55 we are interested in the baryonic mass fraction , @xmath56 , but even in rich clusters not all baryons are in the form of gas , and selection factors may operate in bringing baryons and dark matter into clusters .",
    "white  ( 1993 ) introduced a `` baryon enhancement factor '' @xmath57 to describe these effects .",
    "@xmath57 may be defined by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the initial contribution of _ gas _ to @xmath14 ( note that @xmath60 ) and @xmath61 is the gas mass fraction in the cluster immediately after formation .",
    "@xmath57 is really the _ gas _ enhancement factor , because the simulations do not distinguish between baryonic condensed objects if any ( galaxies , stars , machos ) and non - baryonic dark - matter particles .",
    "all of these are lumped together in the term @xmath62 and interact only by gravitation .",
    "if all the baryons start out as gas @xmath63 , and if gas turns into condensed objects only _ after _ cluster formation , then equation  ( [ eq : f_g0 ] ) may be rewritten : @xmath64 where @xmath52 is the present cluster gas - mass fraction and @xmath65 the present cluster mass fraction in baryonic condensed objects of all kinds ( galaxies , stars , machos ) .",
    "white  ( 1993 ) took some pains to estimate the ratio @xmath66 within the abell radius of the coma cluster , counting only galaxies ( no stars or machos ) in @xmath65 .",
    "they obtained @xmath67 this is large , so unless systematic errors in this estimate are very large , the baryonic content of this cluster ( at least ) is dominated by the hot gas . carrying @xmath65 along as an indication of the size of the mean correction for all clusters , and solving equations  ( [ eq : f_g+f_gal ] ) and ( [ eq : f_g / f_gal ] ) for @xmath68",
    ", we find @xmath69^{-1 } ( \\upsilon \\ ,   \\omega_{\\rm{b}}/\\omega_{\\rm{m}})\\,h^{3/2 } ,   \\label{eq : f_gh}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 is given from @xmath0 and @xmath35 by equation  ( [ eq : omega_b ] ) .",
    "this is the appropriate theoretical function of the free parameters to fit to the observations .",
    "we set @xmath70 in our  standard \" case .",
    "although this is representative of results from simulations , cen ( 1997 ) finds that the determination of @xmath52 from x - ray observations may be biased toward high @xmath52 by large - scale projection effects ; i.e. , the calculated @xmath52 exceeds the true @xmath52 present in a cluster by a bias factor which can be as large as 1.4 .",
    "although evrard  ( 1996 ) and evrard ( 1997 ) have not observed such a bias in their simulations , shf explored its effect on our analysis by using for @xmath57 , instead of 0.9 , an `` effective value '' @xmath71 .",
    "the last observable we use is the `` shape parameter '' @xmath33 , which describes the transfer function relating the initial perturbation spectrum @xmath72 to the present spectrum @xmath73 of large - scale power fluctuations , as observed , e.g. , in the galaxy correlation function .",
    "when the spectral index @xmath42 of @xmath74 has been chosen , @xmath33 is determined by fitting the observed @xmath73 .",
    "results of observations may be cast in terms of an `` effective shape parameter '' @xmath33 ( white , 1996 ) which we take as our observable .",
    "studies show that for the usual range of cdm models , with or without @xmath6 , the expression for @xmath33 is @xmath75   - 0.32 \\ ( n^{-1}-1 )   \\label{eq : gamma_th }   \\ ] ] ( peacock and dodds , 1994 ; sugiyama , 1995 ; liddle , 1996a , b ; white , 1996 ; liddle and viana , 1996 ; peacock , 1997 ) . for @xmath76 ,",
    "if @xmath34 and @xmath77 are small , we have @xmath78 .",
    "the harrison - zeldovich ( scale - invariant , untilted ) case is @xmath79 , which we adopt for our standard case .",
    "in contrast to the  standard \" case in shf , here we adopt the more conservative choice ( larger error bars ) for the observed value of @xmath33 , @xmath80 ( cf .",
    "peacock and dodds , 1994 ; maddox , efstathiou , and sutherland , 1996 ) .",
    "this is based on the galaxy correlation function , and it assumes that light traces mass .",
    "equations  ( [ eq : gamma_th ] ) and ( [ eq : gamma_obs ] ) imply , very roughly , that @xmath81 .",
    "the shape - parameter constraint is in a sense the least robust of the constraints we have discussed since it is not part of the basic friedmann model .",
    "rather , it depends on a theory for the primordial fluctuations and how they evolve .",
    "if the friedmann cosmology were threatened by this constraint , we believe that those who model large - scale structure would find a way to discard it .",
    "therefore shf have also explored the consequences of removing this constraint and replacing it with one on @xmath14 derived from the @xmath82 ratio in clusters and the luminosity density of the universe ( carlberg , yee , and ellingson , 1997 ) or one based on studies of large - scale flows around voids ( dekel and rees , 1994 ; cf .",
    "dekel , 1997 ) .",
    "for our standard case we have four observational constraints : @xmath83 , @xmath84 gyr , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 . for this standard case",
    "we assume @xmath79 and @xmath70 .",
    "the results for our three cosmological parameters are displayed in figures 1 and 2 where the 68% and 95% confidence regions (  crs \" ) are shown .",
    "also shown are the projected crs obtained by computing @xmath32 for single observables alone , or for pairs of observables .",
    "these are not true crs but are intended to guide the reader in understanding how the various constraints influence the closed contours which show our quantitative results .",
    "our best - fit values for the three key cosmological parameters are : @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "although the condition @xmath90 poses some threat to the scdm @xmath91 model , figure 1 shows that this threat is far from acute given our more accurate form of the @xmath33 constraint in equation  ( [ eq : gamma_th ] ) , as long as the error on @xmath2 is large ( 0.15 ) and bbn constraints are discarded .",
    "the exponential term in equation  ( [ eq : gamma_th ] ) becomes significant because the @xmath52 constraint forces @xmath34 to increase with @xmath14 allowing the product @xmath92 to exceed 0.25 .",
    "this has been noted before ( white , 1996 ; lineweaver , 1997 ) . the scdm model with @xmath14",
    "= 1 and @xmath93 is acceptable but the high value for the baryon - to - photon ratio , @xmath94 , is in conflict with the inferred primordial abundances of * all * the light nuclides .",
    "note that , although the uncertainties are large , low values of @xmath0 are disfavored ( see figure 2 ) .    if we add the dekel - rees estimate of @xmath14 ( @xmath95 ) , the five - constraint fit favors somewhat higher values of @xmath14 and @xmath0 and slightly lower values of @xmath35 .",
    "in contrast , if instead we include the cluster estimate ( @xmath96 ; carlberg , 1997 ; cf .",
    "carlberg , yee , and ellingson , 1997 ) , we find a barely acceptable fit ( @xmath97 = 5.0 for 2 dof , 92% cl ) , which favors lower values of @xmath14 and @xmath0 and slightly higher values of @xmath35 .",
    "tilt in the primordial spectrum has been investigated in many papers ( liddle , 1996a , b ; white , 1996 ; kolatt and dekel , 1997 ; white and silk , 1996 ; liddle and viana , 1996 ) .",
    "we considered the effect of a moderate `` red tilt '' ( @xmath98 instead of @xmath79 ) .",
    "this has the effect ( see equation  [ eq : gamma_th ] ) of raising slightly the 68% and 95% contours in figure 1 . with this tilt",
    "the @xmath33 constraint favors higher @xmath14 , so that the scdm model is allowed for @xmath35 up to nearly 0.5 .",
    "the favored likelihood range for @xmath0 is now also higher , though @xmath28 is still allowed .",
    "however , the higher allowed range for @xmath99 does threaten the consistency of bbn .",
    "conversely , a `` blue '' tilt , @xmath100 ( hancock , 1994 ) , would move the cr downward and allow models with @xmath101 at high @xmath35 .    changing to a gas enhancement factor",
    "@xmath102 ( modest positive enhancement of gas in clusters ) instead of 0.9 does not change the contours in figure 1 by much since @xmath33 is only weakly coupled to @xmath34 through the exponential term in @xmath33 .",
    "although the effect is to lower the contours in figure 1 slightly and to move downward the acceptable range for @xmath0 , @xmath103 is still excluded , disfavoring the low d abundance inferred from some qso absorbers and favoring a higher helium abundance than is revealed by the -region data .",
    "the possibility that the fraction of cluster mass in baryons in galaxies , isolated stars , and machos @xmath104 might be larger  even much larger  than is implied by equation  ( [ eq : f_g / f_gal ] ) would affect the crs in much the same way as a _ small _ @xmath57 , favoring even higher values of @xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath33 constraint is crucial for our standard results favoring high @xmath14 and high @xmath99 .",
    "if , for example , we drop the @xmath33 constraint and in its place use the cluster estimate @xmath105 , low @xmath14 and low @xmath99 are now favored ( see shf ) .",
    "the acceptability  or not  of the scdm model depends crucially on the choice of hubble parameter .",
    "shf have experimented with replacing the standard constraint on h@xmath106 with @xmath107 .",
    "now , the scdm model is strongly excluded .",
    "shf have also considered models with nonzero @xmath6 , limiting their investigation to the popular flat ( @xmath108 = 0 ) `` @xmath6cdm '' models with @xmath109 , where @xmath110 . for these models",
    "there are still only three free parameters and the four constraints discussed earlier are still in force , except that the product of the age and the hubble parameter is a different function of @xmath111 : @xmath112 gyr [ carroll , press , and turner , 1992 , equation ( 17 ) ] . for a given @xmath113 ,",
    "the age is longer for the flat @xmath114 model than for the @xmath46 model .",
    "the results differ very little from those in figures 1 and 2 .",
    "the longer ages do allow the crs to slide farther down toward large @xmath35 and small @xmath14 .",
    "because of the longer ages at low @xmath14 ( high @xmath115 ) , @xmath44 from clusters can now be accepted as a fifth constraint . in this case ( see shf ) large @xmath14 and small @xmath35 are now excluded while @xmath116 is still favored strongly .",
    "if bbn constraints on the baryon density are removed ( or relaxed ) , the interaction among the shape - parameter @xmath117 constraint , the cluster baryon fraction ( @xmath52 ) constraint , and the value of @xmath0 assumes critical importance . these constraints still permit a flat cdm model , but only as long as @xmath9 is allowed by observations of @xmath35 .",
    "the @xmath52 constraint means that large @xmath14 implies fairly large @xmath34 .",
    "therefore the exponential term in @xmath33 becomes important allowing @xmath118 to satisfy the @xmath33 constraint .",
    "however , values of @xmath119 are required ( see figures 1 and 2 ) .",
    "the best - fit scdm model has @xmath93 and @xmath120 , which is grossly inconsistent with the predictions of bbn and the observed abundances of d , @xmath13he , and @xmath19li . for @xmath121 a fit to scdm",
    "is no longer possible .",
    "the scdm model is severely challenged .    the @xmath33 and age constraints also challenge low - density cdm models .",
    "the @xmath33 constraint permits @xmath122 only for high @xmath35 , while the age constraint forbids high @xmath35 , so @xmath10 is required . the bound @xmath123 conflicts with the added cluster constraint @xmath124 at the 98% cl , suggesting strongly that there is additional mass not traced by light .",
    "although a few plausible variations on the cdm models do not affect the constraints very much , removing the @xmath33 constraint would have a dramatic effect .",
    "both high and low values of @xmath14 would then be permitted .",
    "the @xmath33 constraint plays a crucial role in our analysis .    at either low or high density ,",
    "the situation remains about the same for the @xmath6cdm models . because the ages are longer , we can tolerate @xmath125 for @xmath126 .",
    "the @xmath6cdm model therefore accepts more easily the added constraint @xmath96 .",
    "improved future constraints on @xmath127 will come into play here .",
    "having bounded the baryon density using data independent of constraints from bbn , we may explore the consequences for the light - element abundances . in general , our fits favor large values of @xmath0 ( @xmath11 ) over small values ( @xmath12 ) . while such large values of the baryon density are consistent with estimates from the ly-@xmath128 forest , they do create some tension for bbn . for deuterium",
    "there is no problem , since for @xmath129 the bbn - predicted abundance , ( d / h)@xmath130 @xmath131 ( 2@xmath23 ) , is entirely consistent with the low abundance inferred for some of the observed qso absorbers ( tytler , 1996 ; burles and tytler , 1996 ) .",
    "similarly , the bbn - predicted lithium abundance , ( li / h)@xmath132 ( 2@xmath23 ) , is consistent with the observed surface lithium abundances in the old , metal - poor stars ( allowing , perhaps , some minimal destruction or dilution of the prestellar lithium ) .",
    "however , the real challenge comes from @xmath13he where the bbn prediction for @xmath133 , y@xmath134 ( 2@xmath23 ) , is to be contrasted with the -region data which suggest y@xmath130 @xmath135 ( os , oss ) .    the research of g.s .",
