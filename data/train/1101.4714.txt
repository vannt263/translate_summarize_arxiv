    "nonleptonic decays of charmed mesons are very interesting as they can provide useful information on flavor mixing , cp violation , and strong interactions@xcite",
    ". they may also shed light on any new physics signal through @xmath3 mixing and rare decays@xcite .",
    "the cleo - c and two b factories experiments have given many new results on this subject and more are expected soon from the bes - iii experiment .",
    "besides , theoretical studies have been in progress for decades .    with the heavy quark effective theory ,",
    "many qcd - inspired approaches , such as the qcd factorization approach @xcite , the perturbative qcd approach @xcite , and the soft - collinear effective theory @xcite , successfully describe the hadronic b decays . however , this is not the case for the @xmath4 meson decays .",
    "these approaches do not work well here , due to the mass of charm quark , of order 1.5gev , which is not heavy enough for a sensible heavy quark expansion , neither light enough to apply the chiral perturbation theory .",
    "after decades of studies , the factorization approach is still one of the effective ways to deal with the two - body charmed meson decays@xcite .",
    "however , it is well known that some difficulties exist in the naive factorization approach : the wilson coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 of effective operators are renormalization scale and @xmath7-scheme dependent ; and the color - suppressed processes are not calculated well due to the smallness of @xmath8 , etc . in order to solve these problems ,",
    "the so - called generalized factorization approach was proposed @xcite .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath5 and @xmath6 are not from direct calculation any more but are effective coefficients to accommodate the important nonfactorizable corrections @xcite . in these naive or generalized factorization approaches ,",
    "there is almost no strong phase . but",
    "large strong phases have been found from @xmath4 decay experiments . a corresponding large relative strong phase between the factorization coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath8 has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "unsatisfied by the short comings of the factorization approach , the model - independent diagrammatic approach , with various topological amplitudes extracted from the data , is recently applied to two - body hadronic @xmath4 decays @xcite .",
    "they use su(3 ) symmetry in their analysis to avoid model calculations .",
    "all the parameters are fitted from experiments to give a better agreement with the experimental data but with less predictive power .",
    "more precise predictions are limited in this approach due to the uncontrolled su(3 ) breaking effect@xcite .",
    "these analyses also show that large annihilation type contributions are needed to explain the data , which can not be calculated in the naive or generalized factorization approaches .",
    "the kind of pure annihilation type @xmath4 meson decays also needs to be systematically analyzed @xcite .    in another aspect",
    ", the hadronic picture description of nonleptonic weak decays has a longer history , because of their nonperturbative feature . based on the idea of vector dominance , which is discussed on strange particle decays@xcite , the pole - dominance model of two - body nonleptonic decays is proposed @xcite . beyond the vector dominance pole ,",
    "this model also involves scalar , pseudoscalar , and axial - vector poles . for simplicity , only the lowest - lying poles are considered .",
    "this model has already been applied to charmed meson and bottom meson decays @xcite , where it is approved that this model is more or less equivalent to the factorization approach in the first order approximation .    in this work",
    ", we will use the generalized factorization approach but with a relative strong phase between the wilson coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath8 to accommodate the nonfactorizable contributions . for the uncalculable annihilation type contributions , we use the pole model . in this case",
    ", we can really calculate most of the important contributions in the hadronic @xmath4 decays , which are demonstrated in the model - independent diagrammatic analysis @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii , we give the formulas of this work , showing the generalized factorization approach and the pole - dominance model . in sec.iii , our results are given and compared to the experimental data and those of the diagrammatic approach and the calculations considering the final - state interaction of nearby resonances effects .",
    "summary and conclusions are followed .",
    "first we begin with the weak effective hamiltonian @xmath10 for the @xmath11 transition @xcite : @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the corresponding cabibbo - kobayashi- maskawa ( ckm ) matrix elements , @xmath14 are the wilson coefficients . the current - current operators @xmath15 are @xmath16 where @xmath17 are color indices , and @xmath18 are @xmath19 or @xmath20 quarks .",
    "the color - favored emission diagram corresponding to @xmath21 decays , with @xmath22 representing a pseudoscalar meson , is shown in fig .",
    "[ figfac ] ( a ) . under the factorization hypothesis , the transition matrix element of hadronic two - body charmed meson decays is factorized into two parts @xcite : @xmath23 similarly , the contribution of the color - suppressed diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ figfac ] ( b ) is given as @xmath24 where @xmath25 correspond to the color - favored tree diagram ( @xmath26 ) and the color - suppressed diagram ( @xmath27 ) respectively in the naive factorization , with the number of colors @xmath28 .",
    "they are assumed to be universal and process - independent in the native factorization approach .",
    "the current matrix elements in eqs.([matrixelement],[matrixelement2 ] ) are evaluated in terms of transition form factors and decay constants . for @xmath29 decays",
    ", the form factor is defined as follows : @xmath30f_1^{d\\to p}(q^2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{m_d^2-m_p^2}{q^2}q_{\\mu}f_0^{d\\to p}(q^2),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath31 , and @xmath32 are the corresponding transition form factors .",
    "the decay constants @xmath33 of pseudoscalar mesons are defined as @xmath34    in terms of decay constant and transition form factors , the decay amplitude of figs.[figfac ] ( a ) and ( b ) are then @xmath35 @xmath36    the diagrams for @xmath37 decays , with @xmath38 denoting a vector meson , are shown in figs .",
    "[ figfac ] ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "if the out - emitted particle is a pseudoscalar meson , the matrix element of fig .",
    "[ figfac ] ( c ) is @xmath39 the @xmath40 transition form factors are usually defined as @xmath41 where @xmath42 is the polarization vector of the vector meson , and @xmath43 and @xmath38 are corresponding transition form factors . utilizing the form factor definitions we get the result for eq.([factorizationdtov ] ) : @xmath44 if a vector meson is out emitted , the matrix element of fig .",
    "[ figfac](c ) is @xmath45 where the decay constants @xmath46 of vector mesons are defined as @xmath47    for the color - suppressed diagram , fig.[figfac](d ) , we have similar formulas as eqs.([factorizationdtov2],[factorizationdtop ] ) , but with the wilson coefficient changed from @xmath9 to @xmath8 .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the wilson coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath8 are renormalization - scale dependent in the naive factorization approach and it fails to describe the color - suppressed processes with too small @xmath48 .",
    "so the generalized factorization method is proposed to include the nonfactorizable contributions @xcite , @xmath49 where the terms @xmath50 characterize the nonfactorizable corrections involving vertex corrections , hard spectator interactions , final - state interactions , resonance effects , etc .",
    "these @xmath51 will compensate the scale- and scheme - dependence of the wilson coefficients , so that @xmath0 s are physical now . without confusion",
    ", we will drop the superscript `` eff '' in the effective wilson coefficients for convenience in the following discussions . in the large-@xmath52 approach , the 1/@xmath52 terms are discarded@xcite , equally with a universal nonfactorizable term @xmath53 , hence",
    ", @xmath54 this implies a null relative strong phase between the two kinds of contributions .",
    "however , the experimental data tell us that there should be a large strong phase between @xmath9 and @xmath8 . on the other hand ,",
    "the existence of relative phases is reasonable for the importance of inelastic final - state interactions of the @xmath4 meson decays , in which the on - shell intermediate states contribute imaginary parts .",
    "therefore , we consider a relative phase between the coefficients @xmath9 and @xmath8 in this work , so that @xmath55 where we set @xmath9 real for convenience .      the annihilation type diagrams are neglected as an approximation in the factorization model .",
    "however , considerable contributions come from the weak annihilation diagrams in the @xmath4 decays , which can be demonstrated by the difference of lifetime between @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "hence , we will calculate them in a single pole - dominance model . for simplicity ,",
    "only the lowest - lying poles are considered in the single - pole model .",
    "taking @xmath58 as an example , the annihilation - type diagram in the pole model is shown in fig .",
    "[ pole1](a ) .",
    "@xmath56 goes into @xmath59 via the weak interaction in eq .",
    "( [ effectivehamiltonian ] ) shown in terms of quark lines in fig .",
    "[ pole1](b ) , and then decays into @xmath60 through the strong interaction .",
    "angular momentum should be conserved at the weak vertex and all conservation laws be preserved at the strong vertex .",
    "so it is a pseudoscalar meson as a resonant state for @xmath37 decays .",
    "the weak matrix element is evaluated in the vacuum insertion approximation@xcite , @xmath61 where the subscript @xmath62 of the wilson coefficient @xmath63 denotes a w - exchange diagram for @xmath37 , otherwise @xmath64 corresponds to w - annihilation contributions .",
    "in fact , the effective wilson coefficients of the w - annihilation diagrams and w - exchange diagrams have the same form as @xmath9 and @xmath8 in eq.([effa ] ) , that is @xmath65 where @xmath66 represents the nonfactorizable contributions in the annihilation ( exchange ) process .",
    "since the nonfactorizable contributions in these kinds of diagrams are large and with relatively different strong phases , we use different symbols to avoid confusing in our approach for these collective effective wilson coefficients as @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively .",
    "strong phases relative to the emission diagrams are considered in the wilson coefficients .",
    "the effective strong coupling constant of @xmath59 to @xmath60 is defined through the lagrangian @xmath69 where @xmath70 is dimensionless . inserting the propagator of the intermediate @xmath59 meson ,",
    "the decay amplitude is @xmath71        similarly , in @xmath29 decays , it is a scalar meson as a resonant state .",
    "the effective strong coupling constant is described by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the mass of the scalar meson .",
    "besides , the scalar meson decay constant of the vector current is defined as @xmath74    therefore , the corresponding matrix element is @xmath75    as a convenience of reference , the various decay formulas of individual decay modes are collected in the appendix .",
    "note that some of the intermediate resonances are unstable particles which have large width and therefore contribute large relative phases .",
    "these phases are absorbed in the effective wilson coefficients @xmath68 and @xmath67 for convenience .",
    "in order to calculate the emission type diagrams in the factorization approach , we need to know the transition form factors and meson decay constants . the decay constants of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath4 and @xmath78",
    "are taken from the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite , others are from @xcite , all of which are summarized in table  [ decayconstant ] .",
    "there exist many models to parametrize the transition form factors and their @xmath79 dependence @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall use the dipole model @xcite : @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the mass of the pole .",
    "the corresponding poles are @xmath82 for @xmath83 , @xmath84 for @xmath85 , @xmath4 for @xmath86 , and @xmath78 for @xmath87 .",
    "the transition form factors and @xmath88 parameters of @xmath4 to @xmath76 and @xmath77 are taken from the recent cleo - c measurement @xcite , @xmath89 are from @xcite , and others from @xcite , all of which are shown in table  [ formfactor1 ] .    for the final states involving @xmath90 or @xmath91 , it is convenient to consider the flavor mixing of @xmath92 and @xmath93 with a mixing angle @xmath94 , @xmath95 where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are defined by @xmath96 a recent experimental measurement from the kloe collaboration gives the mixing angle @xmath97@xcite .    .meson decay constants ( mev ) . those of @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath4 , and @xmath78 are from pdg@xcite , others are from @xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     our prediction of branching ratios of the cabibbo - favored , the singly cabibbo - suppressed and the doubly cabibbo - suppressed @xmath98 decays are shown in tables  [ cfpv ] , [ scspv ] , and [ dcspv ] , respectively .",
    "the results in the third column ( emission ) in each of these tables are the predictions of rates with only the emission - type processes ; while the results in the fourth column ( all ) also include the annihilation - type contributions .",
    "it is obvious that the annihilation - type contributions are of the same order as the emission - type diagrams , since the intermediate states here in the pole model are pseudoscalar mesons with relatively larger decay constants than those scalar mesons of the @xmath29 case .",
    "again , for theoretical uncertainty estimation , we use only those from the parameters @xmath0 shown in eq.([eq:2 ] ) , as illustration . for comparison",
    ", we also list the results of the diagrammatic approach @xcite and the experimental date in these tables .",
    "it is easy to see that our results with the annihilation - type contributions agree with the experimental data .",
    "this means that the single - pole contribution dominates the annihilation - type contribution in most @xmath37 decay channels .",
    "for example , although the @xmath99 channel has no emission - type contribution , with vanishing branching ratio in the factorization approach , our pole model gives the right branching ratios agreeing with the experiment .",
    "this also confirms the calculation done in the perturbative qcd approach @xcite .",
    "besides , some of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking effects are considered in this work since the decay constants , transition form factors and effective strong coupling constants are involved .",
    "there is no resonant state contributing to the w - exchange diagram of @xmath100 in the pole model , because a @xmath101 would violate the @xmath102 parity , similarly to the case of @xmath103 .",
    "besides , the single - pole annihilation diagrams can not contribute to the @xmath104 decays because of @xmath105 parity violation .",
    "the isospin of resonant state for @xmath106 or @xmath107 is one , so the @xmath105 parity of the intermediate state is odd since it is a pseudoscalar meson .",
    "however , the @xmath105 parity of @xmath108 and @xmath90 are both even , and that of @xmath76 and @xmath109 are both odd , so the total @xmath105 parity of the final states is even .",
    "therefore , no resonant states are available for the decays of @xmath4 mesons into @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "it is even worse for the pure annihilation process @xmath110 , since its decay rate is predicted to be zero in the single - pole model , but it is not small in the experiment .",
    "this has already been discussed that this channel may be dominated by the final - state rescattering via quark exchange in @xcite , and by hidden strangeness final - state interactions in @xcite .",
    "besides , the pure annihilation mode @xmath111 is predicted much larger in the pole model than the experiment data . the contributions from the two diagrams in this channel are constructive since the minus sign in the normalization of @xmath112 is compensated by the asymmetric space wave function of the two final states which are in the @xmath22-wave state .",
    "these two channels make such trouble that we fail to find a reasonable solution of @xmath113 and @xmath114 and predict the @xmath2 modes with the w - annihilation contributions in the diagrammatic approach@xcite .",
    "hence , further discussions are still needed for these two channels .",
    "@xmath115 is predicted much smaller than the mode of @xmath116 , but the experimental branching ratios of the former is larger .",
    "this is a puzzle that the phase space of the former mode is much smaller than the latter , so its branching ratio should be smaller .",
    "in fact , the experimental measurement of @xmath115 @xcite is already too old .",
    "it is already questioned by the pdg @xcite , since this branching fraction @xmath117 considerably exceeds the recent inclusive @xmath91 fraction of @xmath118 .",
    "we have calculated the branching ratios for the two - body hadronic decays of charmed mesons into @xmath1 and @xmath2 using the generalized factorization approach for the emission - type diagrams and the pole - dominance model for the annihilation - type diagrams .",
    "relative strong phases between different topological diagrams , which are important in the charmed decays , are considered in this work .",
    "most of our predicted branching fractions are in accordance with the experimental data .",
    "besides , compared to the naive and generalized factorization models ever before , the results in this work are much better since we have considered the annihilation - type diagrams and the relative strong phases between diagrams .",
    "we find that the annihilation - type contributions in the pole model are large for both @xmath1 and @xmath2 modes , which is also indicated by the difference between the life time of @xmath57 and @xmath56 .",
    "comparing with the model - independent diagrammatic approach , we reproduce their results with our specific model considering some su(3 ) breaking effects .",
    "furthermore , we get more predictions in many @xmath37 decay channels , which are absent in the diagrammatic approach@xcite .",
