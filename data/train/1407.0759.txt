    "galaxy groups and clusters are known as the most massive gravitationally bound systems in the universe .",
    "their gravitational potential is sufficient enough to bound large amounts of intergalactic gas within its central region .",
    "this intergalactic medium ( igm ) shows core temperatures of the order of million of kelvin , which has been revealed by x - ray observations , as one of the key properties of these structures . to understand the observed state of the gas , various heating- and cooling - processes",
    "have been proposed to work and are related to the thermal history in the formation of the group or cluster . to study the interplay of these processes fossil galaxy groups seem to be promising candidates .",
    "+ fossil groups are dominated by a giant elliptical galaxy at the centroid of their x - ray emission and have been discovered in the mid 1990 using selection criteria in the optical and x - ray bands @xcite .",
    "the morphology of the luminous x - ray emission in fossils is regular and symmetric , indicating the absence of a recent group - scale merger .",
    "@xcite reported a higher dark matter concentration in fossil halos compared to non - fossil groups and clusters with similar masses .",
    "in addition , theoretical studies using the millennium simulations showed that most of the halo mass in fossil galaxy groups is assembled earlier compared to the general population of galaxy groups @xcite .",
    "all this together and the absent of @xmath1 galaxies suggest that they arguably are old galaxy groups . up",
    "to now more than one hundred galaxy groups have been classified as `` fossil groups '' by different studies @xcite .",
    "however , the selection criteria are not strictly met in all studies and vary from the convention introduced by @xcite . according to the @xcite definition , observationally a galaxy group is fossil if it has an x - ray luminosity of @xmath2 erg s@xmath3 and its dominant galaxy is at least two magnitudes brighter , in @xmath4-band , than the second ranked galaxy within half the projected virial radius of the group ( @xmath5 ) . note that an alternative criteria with @xmath6 within the same radius , reveals fifty percent more early - formed systems @xcite .",
    "generally , the igm in group and cluster of galaxies reaches very hot core temperatures and therefore emits x - rays in form of bremsstrahlung and atomic line emission .",
    "the cooling process itself works via the energy loss through both continuum- and spectral - emission and cools down the inter - galactic gas such that the gas is falling deeper into the potential well . in this process",
    "the gas density increases at the core and further boosts the x - ray emission , as the x - ray emissivity is proportional to the square of the gas density @xcite .",
    "this cooling flow will produce a strong surface brightness peak toward the centre of clusters and a drop in temperature in the core @xcite .",
    "this classical picture does not consider any heating mechanism , which must be in place , because x - ray observations of galaxy clusters by chandra and xmm - newton show no sign of gas temperatures below @xmath7 kev .",
    "among all the heating sources suggested in the literature , agns are the most promising candidates to be powerful enough to heat up the icm above the observed gas temperatures @xcite . in particular several mechanism",
    "are proposed : ( i ) the agn can heat up the igm by depositing relativistic electrons through jets and with the mechanical work of expanding bubbles .",
    "the dissipation heat of shock waves and sound waves induced by agns are also considered ( see @xcite .",
    "( ii ) cosmic rays could heat via agn activity in addition to mechanical heating has been proposed @xcite .",
    "( iii ) conduction of heat from hot outer layers of cluster into the centre is also suggested @xcite .",
    "( iv ) galaxy merger @xcite and intra - cluster supernovae @xcite would provide sufficient energy to be injected to the icm .",
    "apart from the heating scenario the efficiency of mechanical heating to quench the cooling rate is also investigated in the literature .",
    "@xcite showed that the bubble enthalpy is sufficient to balance the cooling at least for half of the galaxy clusters in their samples .",
    "the efficiency to quench the cooling rate does dramatically increase in elliptical galaxies as @xcite showed for a sample of nearby giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "the energy released by agn jets in the form of bubbles are estimated by several authors @xcite .",
    "finding these cavities in the x - ray surface brightness distribution of galaxy clusters by chandra and xmm - newton would support the picture of bubble heating in the icm .",
    "in many of these cavities the radio emissions at gigahertz or above might fall below the detection threshold and thus low radio frequency observations may enables us to trace these cavities @xcite .    the igm heating due to agn is generally blamed for the observed discrepancies in the scaling relations in the galaxy groups regime @xcite , such as the deviations from the self - similar scaling observed for galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "however , due to the complex nature of the galaxy groups , which are subject to both group scale mergers and galaxy - galaxy mergers , the share of the agn in the igm heating can not be estimated accurately .",
    "having a sample of galaxy groups in which there are no signs of recent galaxy mergers within the group and the groups scale mergers is very attractive as it eliminates some of the above complexities .",
    "as mentioned earlier , fossil galaxy groups offer both these advantages at the same time .",
    "the morphological studies of the central galaxy in fossil groups , the isophotal shapes in particular , shows that they are not boxy type @xcite , which points at the lack of dry merger in their recent evolutionary history .",
    "furthermore , the formation history of the groups also point to an early formation epoch .",
    "there are , however , counter evidences for this , presented by la barbera et al ( 2012 ) .",
    "in this study we aim to investigate the heating mechanism in place of the intercluster medium in fossil galaxy groups . for this",
    ", we observed a sample of well - known fossil group in the radio regime with the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) at 610 mhz and 1.4 ghz .",
    "in addition , the optical and x - ray properties are used to investigate the characteristics of this sample of fossil groups in comparision with a sample of normal galaxy groups and clusters in radio band .",
    "this is the first study to focus on the igm heating in a sample of fossil galaxy groups .    in section [ sec : sample ] , the sample and the radio observations are discussed including the data reduction .",
    "the radio properties are shown in section [ sec : result ] combined with a brief description on the x - ray and optical characteristics . in section [ sec : heating ] the heating mechanism and their energy requirements are discussed . in section [ sec : accretion ]",
    "we consider feeding mechanisms of the central agn and section [ sec : stat ] investigates the difference between fossil and non - fossil groups .",
    "for this simple statistical study , radio luminosity and other properties of galaxy groups and clusters are used . the summery and conclusion is presented in section [ sec : summery ] . throughout this paper",
    "we assumed a @xmath8 cosmology with the following parameters : @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 km s@xmath3 mpc@xmath3 where @xmath12 = 0.71 . +    [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     we define two cooling radius within which the x - ray loss are determined .",
    "first the radius that cooling time falls below the hubble time , @xmath13 , and second the radius at which the temperature drops indicating the presence of a cool core , @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) . for eso 3060170",
    ", there is a clear temperature drop below 10 kpc while for j1416 there is just a slight decrease in the temperature profile below 50 kpc .",
    "the bolometric x - ray luminosity within both radii are determined and reported in table 7 . to calculate heating rate of radio bubbles , we adapted three different time scales introduced by @xcite , all listed in table 6 .",
    "we calculate the mechanical heating assuming the over pressure factors ( @xmath16 ) of 2 and 10 for the expanding bubble @xcite . in this way , the enthalpy change is @xcite : @xmath17\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath18 is the adiabatic index , p and v are igm pressure and the bubble volume , respectively . for eso 3060170 , mechanical power changes from 0.5 to 5.3@xmath19",
    "erg s@xmath3 applying different time scales and over pressure factors .",
    "although this is quite sufficient to stop cooling within the @xmath14 with x - ray loss of @xmath20 erg s@xmath3 , it is not comparable to the x - ray loss within @xmath13 , with @xmath21 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "as it is shown in table 7 , this is also seen in j1416 .",
    "thus a more energetic ( e.g. for eso 3060170 , @xmath22 erg ) or rapid ( @xmath23 yr ) cycle of agn activity is needed .",
    "the latter is not typical for agns while the former is probable .",
    "@xcite show , for a sample of galaxy clusters , that mechanical heating is efficient if they assumed 1 pv to 16 pv energy per cavity . in our sample 6 pv and 34 pv energy per cavity are required to stop the cooling process in j1416 and eso 3060170 , respectively .",
    "this is significantly higher than the total enthalpy of a cavity or a radio lobe ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "so mechanical heating does not seem to be a major contributor to the igm heating for these objects , however agn can still be an important sources of heating via other mechanisms ( see e.g. the following sections ) .",
    "[ fig15 ] shows the @xmath25-@xmath26 plot for the @xcite sample and our fossil objects . since we detected bubbles at radio band in our sample , we adopted just filled cavities of @xcite sample to make the analogy reliable .",
    "the horizontal axis is x - ray luminosities within cooling radius .",
    "our fossil groups are located in poor clusters criteria and fall below 4pv line .",
    "although the sample size is very small , there is no indication that the mechanical power differs between fossil and non - fossil systems .",
    "we further investigate agn power in fossil and non - fossil systems via their radio luminosities and other clusters and groups characteristics ( section [ sec : stat ] ) .",
    "one of the noticeable results in this study is that the two most x - ray luminous and massive objects in our sample just possess agn radio bubbles .",
    "this is consistent with apparent correlation between l@xmath27 and l@xmath28 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] .",
    "however the plot suffers from weak selection biases @xcite . in section [ sec : stat ] , we also try to investigate this issue using various samples of galaxy groups and clusters .    in estimating the mechanical heating of radio bubble",
    ", we assumed it is in pressure balance with the surrounding gas , with such assumption one can deduce magnetic field of the radio lobe @xcite .",
    "thermal pressure out of the bubble should be equal to particle pressure plus magnetic field pressure inside the lobe . using this method we deduced magnetic field of 63 @xmath29 g for eso 3060170 comparing to equipartition magnetic field ( 0.8 @xmath29 g ) .",
    "in addition to mechanical heating , agns heat the inter galactic gas via weak shocks induced by expanding bubbles or large scale shocks @xcite , sound waves @xcite and interacting of shocks and bubbles @xcite .",
    "shock energy per volume is approximated by pressure jump across the shock front .",
    "therefore we have @xmath30 pressure ratio at shocked ( @xmath31 ) and unshocked ( @xmath32 ) regions are given by @xmath33 here @xmath18 is adiabatic index and m is mach number estimated from temperature increase using @xmath34[{\\gamma}-1+{\\frac{2}{{m}^{2}}}]}{{({\\gamma}+1)}^{2}}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath35 and @xmath36 are the temperatures at shocked and unshocked regions respectively .",
    "the finger shape region in x - ray map of eso 3060170 that we discussed in section [ sec : result5 ] contains hotter gas compared to its surroundings @xcite .",
    "we assumed this x - ray enhancement is the consequence of agn shocks and estimated mach number of @xmath371.2 for that .",
    "concerning its volume , this corresponds to shock heating of @xmath371@xmath38 erg s@xmath3 .",
    "interaction of radio bubbles of previous agn cycles with agn shocks and dissipation of their rotational energy in vortices ( vortex heating ) is another heating source provided by agns @xcite . to examine this idea",
    ", we evaluated the energy for our detected radio bubbles assuming they are confronted agn weak shocks .",
    "the energy in the vortex field is given by @xmath39 @xmath40 is the icm density , v is the bubble volume and @xmath41 is the velocity jump calculated by shock mach number .",
    "we evaluated the released energy in time scale that the bubble reaches to its current position for both objects .",
    "the heating powers estimated for eso 3060170 and j1416 are 6.4@xmath42 erg s@xmath3 and 4.2@xmath43 erg s@xmath3 respectively .",
    "[ figtest ] illustrates a comparison between three different heating mechanisms supplied by the agns for two sample groups .",
    "conduction is widely discussed in the literature as a uniformly distributed heat supply at the centre of cool core galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "this heating mechanism is discussed in the literature in conduction - only models @xcite or hybrid models of conduction and agn heating @xcite to explain heating and cooling balance in the cooling flow clusters .",
    "the latter would be a good alternative for the models which adapted agns the only source of heating and therefore suffer from direction dependent heating . in section [ sec : heating1 ] and [ sec : heating2 ] , we showed how agns in our sample could not completely stop the cooling . here , we examine thermal conduction as a second source of heating to decide if its power is enough , contrary to the agn power .",
    "we used the similar method we applied in the previous work for j1416 @xcite . here , we work over eso 3060170 that is classified as a strong cool core galaxy group @xcite .",
    "temperature profile of eso 3060170 shows an obvious drop within 10 kpc radius in the centre of group where the cooling time falls below 1gyr .",
    "such a cool region needs @xmath44 erg energy to reach its surrounding temperature .",
    "this energy is one order of magnitude higher than the bubble enthalpy .",
    "so the existence of cool core is not in conflict with the agn outburst energy in this case .",
    "the surprising point is that even if this energy was smaller than agn enthalpy we still see such temperature gap @xcite .",
    "so agn does nt play the main role in this matter .",
    "note that strong cool core clusters ( scc ) are hosting radio load agns more frequent than weak ( wcc ) or non cool core ( ncc ) clusters @xcite that makes this issue more puzzling .",
    "in addition to energy budget adequacy to disturb cool cores , the distribution of heating and cooling rates in igm is also important . in this way",
    ", the question turns to how heat supply distributes over cluster medium which observed temperature profile can be described .    to investigate if conduction is efficient as a uniformly distributed heating mechanism , we deduced conduction time that is the time consumed to thermalize inside and outside of the core .",
    "for the temperature drop of @xmath45 kev within 10 kpc radius with the electron density of 0.08 - 0.02 @xmath46 , conduction time is @xmath47 yr .",
    "this time is one order of magnitude smaller than the cooling time within @xmath14 , so conduction is suppressed 10 times by the magnetic field .",
    "the heating power conducted into the centre of galaxy group is @xmath48 erg s@xmath3 . comparing this power to the x - ray loss within 10 kpc , @xmath49 erg s@xmath3",
    ", it is again confirmed that the conduction is suppressed one order of magnitude by the magnetic field .",
    "thus observing such temperature drop proves suppression factor higher than 10 is needed .",
    "agn powerful outbursts are certainly supported by feeding mechanisms that are still poorly understood .",
    "accretion of hot gas at the vicinity of the black hole , cold molecular gas accretion of the cooling flow , stellar accretion and supper massive black hole spin are the candidates for feeding central agns @xcite . in this section",
    "we investigate different ways of feeding to find if they are powerful enough to explain the observed agn outbursts of eso 3060170 and j1416 .    bondi accretion or hot accretion @xcite , a spherically symmetric collapse of hot gas into the black hole is proportional to the gas temperature , electron density and the black hole mass . to estimate the central black hole mass we adapted @xcite relations for black hole mass and @xmath50 luminosity of the galaxy . for eso 3060170 , @xmath0-band absolute magnitude of @xmath5125.98 from 2mass - xsc results in @xmath52m@xmath53 , so bondi accretion rate will be @xmath54 m@xmath53 yr@xmath3 .",
    "this rate of mass accreted to the centre of galaxy is equal to bondi power of @xmath55 erg s@xmath3 with the assumption of 0.1 efficiency .",
    "this is more than jet power we evaluated in section [ sec : heating ] .",
    "thus for eso 3060170 , the bondi accretion is sufficient to fuel the central agn .",
    "this is not the case for j1416 @xcite .",
    "@xcite discussed accretion of hot gas into black hole from tenth of kilo parsecs away when the gas is gravitationally unstable as a result of radiative cooling . the corresponding heating rate is proportional to @xmath56 , which @xmath57 is the velocity dispersion . for our objects ,",
    "it is 4 - 5 order of magnitude higher than agns powers therefore its efficiency would be too low .",
    "moreover , mass deposition rates , @xmath58 , of isobaric cooling in the core of galaxy groups are @xmath37 0.2 m@xmath53 yr@xmath3 and @xmath37 0.3 m@xmath53 yr@xmath3 for eso 3060170 and j1416 respectively .",
    "these rates are related to the power of @xmath59 erg s@xmath3 that is again far more than the agns powers .",
    "cold molecular gas in the bcgs or the gas provided by cooling flow , accreted into the black hole also produce enough energy ( e.g @xmath60 erg for eso 3060170 ) to light up agns . but lack of correlation between molecular gas and agns jet power @xcite make this idea uncertain .",
    "in addition to that the way that such cold clumps conducted into the super massive black holes is still not clear @xcite .",
    "besides the accretion mechanisms , spinning black hole with a rotating parameter , @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) , and black hole mass of @xmath63 , provides the energy @xcite : @xmath64 we evaluated this energy for our objects and compared it to the total enthalpy of the radio bubbles . for both objects rotating parameter of @xmath65 is consistent with the observed jet energy .",
    "although a maximally rotating black hole , @xmath66 , provide thousands times of this energy .",
    "as mentioned before , galaxy merger as a direct heating source could provide huge amount of energy into the igm .",
    "it has also been shown recently that a large offset between the x - ray emission and the location of the brightest cluster galaxy as a proxy for merging galaxy systems is correlated with the lack of strong cool core in the cluster @xcite .",
    "this is understood to be direct consequence of mergers within the group / cluster environment .",
    "galaxy mergers can also fuel the agn , thus indirectly contribute to the igm heating . to examine the latter",
    ", we compare the radio luminosity of fossil groups as non - merging systems with a general population of galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "in addition , we explore how the radio luminosity in fossil groups scales with other group properties in comparison to other group / cluster samples . to this aim",
    ", we use both bolometric and monochromatic radio luminosity together with group overall characteristics and their bgg ( bcg ) characteristics .      one of the goals of this study is to find out if the giant elliptical galaxies at the core of the fossil groups with large luminosity gap , are more , less or equally active in radio compared to the same in other galaxy groups . the radio luminosity vs. @xmath0-band luminosity of the bggs at 1.4 ghz and 610 mhz is shown in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] , in which we also compare the fossil sample with a sample of galaxy groups presented by @xcite .",
    "the control sample is the only sample of galaxy groups observed with gmrt at 610 mhz in the literature .",
    "the ks luminosities in both the fossil and the comparison samples are extracted from the 2mass extended source catalogue .",
    "the 1.4 ghz luminosities in comparison sample are adopted from the nvss catalogue . the best fit ( figs .",
    "[ fig11]-[fig19 ] ) is estimated based on the method of orthogonal regression @xcite , for each plot .",
    "j1331 appears to be the odd one in the sample .",
    "as mentioned before , it has a bright radio emission for a relatively dim bgg at @xmath67 band .",
    "moreover , j1331 has inverse spectrum within the observing frequencies unlike other bggs in this sample .",
    "we , thus , exclude this target from the fits .",
    "the bggs in fossil groups appear to be under luminous for a given @xmath0-band luminosity , as a proxy to the stellar mass , than the bggs in the comparison groups .",
    "thus it appears that despite a large stellar mass reservoir , the bggs residing in fossil groups are currently less active .",
    "we can interpret this trend as a consequence of non - merging nature of fossil systems , as this appears to be the only major distinction between our sample and the comparison sample . in that case",
    ", the lack of recent galaxy merging lowers the efficiency of the agn fuelling which results in less powerful agn outburst .",
    "alternatively , one could argue ( mulchaey and zabludiff 1999 ) that fossils are drawn from an atypical luminosity function and thus have unusually high stellar masses .",
    "while we can not rule out this possibility , there are evidences which weaken this argument .",
    "fossils have shown to contribute as large as 8 - 20 per cent to the population of galaxy clusters with the same x - ray luminosity .",
    "however , there are no studies in the literature which points out to such an unusual galaxy luminosity function from which fossils are formed .",
    "furthermore , cosmological simulations show that fossil can form with the aforementioned abundance ( dariush et al 2007 ) and thus there is no need to treat them with any special mass function .",
    "the agn radio power also scales with the total stellar mass budget of the group .",
    "this is presented as a correlation between the group total @xmath0-band luminosities and the agn radio luminosity in figs .",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] .",
    "group members have been determined from 2mass redshift survey ( 2mrs ) group catalogue @xcite .",
    "for some galaxy groups for which the data was not available in the 2mrs group catalogue , we used @xcite method to find group members in ned within half of the virial radius of galaxy groups , selecting the group members within a @xmath680.002 redshift slice .",
    "the total @xmath0-band luminosity of comparison groups changes remarkably while for fossil groups with a bright bgg and few dim members , there is no significant change in the @xmath0-band luminosity",
    "[ fig13 ] and [ fig14 ] show that fossils fall comfortably within the distribution of the comparision sample .",
    "radio luminosities in fossil and non - fossil groups share the same scaling with the total stellar mass of the groups while their bggs appear to present a significant offset ( figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] ) , as discussed above .",
    "we will return to this in section [ sec : hiflugcs ] .",
    "the spearman s rank correlation coefficient is estimated for all sample - plots in figs .",
    "[ fig11]-[fig14 ] , with 0.6 - 0.7 for comparison sample and 0.8 - 0.9 for fossil groups .    in a similar attempt ,",
    "@xcite have found correlation between the radio power of bggs and the luminosity gap ( @xmath69 ) within the group .",
    "[ figdm1420 ] and [ figdm610 ] show the radio power vs. the luminosity gap .",
    "we find no such correlation between the radio luminosity and the luminosity gap in either of the observed frequencies .",
    "the radio luminosity of the comparison samples appears be correlated to its luminosity gap ( spearman s rank correlation coefficient of 0.6 ) but the trend is not followed by the fossil groups . in 610 mhz ( fig .",
    "[ figdm610 ] ) , the radio power of the fossil sample is statistically lower than the same in the comparison sample .",
    "thus based on our observations we find no correlation between the radio power and the luminosity gap contrary to @xcite .",
    "this means that the luminosity gap is not the only distinctive parameter in fossil - non fossil sample that decide for the correlation .",
    "other differences e.g. x - ray relaxed nature of fossils may play role in this trend .",
    "@xcite selected elliptical dominated groups , possess structures in x - ray brightness and temperature distribution or radio morphology , contrary to the fossil groups that they have relaxed and undisturbed x - ray emission .",
    "detection of the radio lobes in two fossil groups in our sample could either be the result of agn duty cycle or it may have an origin in the group or host galaxy properties .",
    "these two groups are the most x - ray luminous objects in the sample with largest cooling radius and highest outskirt temperature .",
    "their bggs are brighter in @xmath70-band than the other fossil groups bggs thus the probability that their bggs host a radio loud agn is also higher @xcite .",
    "their bolometric radio luminosities are between 10 mhz to 15 ghz calculated using the spectral index listed in table 4 , are also the highest .",
    "@xcite shows that more powerful jets reside in more radio and x - ray luminous galaxies .",
    "jet power is also tightly correlated to the total radio luminosity if one can eliminate the effect of break frequency @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the radio bolometric luminosity is a measure for agn power and using this , we can investigate how large scale characteristics or central galaxy properties control feedback mechanism in clusters and groups .",
    "@xcite shows , for hiflugcs sample of galaxy clusters , there is a correlation between virial mass , @xmath71 , or classical mass deposition rate , @xmath72 , and the total radio luminosity in strong and weak cool core clusters as well as weak correlation between black hole mass or x - ray luminosity and total radio luminosity in strong cool core clusters . in this section",
    ", we adapted hiflugcs as a control sample to compare with the fossil groups scaling relations .",
    "[ fig16]-[fig19 ] show the results .",
    "the total mass of the cluster , x - ray luminosity and the mass deposition rate are properties of the cluster and the igm , while the black hole mass is a galaxy property .",
    "fossil galaxy groups are archetypal virialized and relaxed systems as they have a smooth and undisturbed x - ray emission map with their bggs located at the position of the x - ray peak of the group .",
    "such an unperturbed igm is fertile to the formation a cool core .",
    "strong cool cores are not detected in galaxy clusters with turbulent , unrelaxed , dynamically active and merging environments such as in coma cluster ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "sanderson et al ( 2009 ) have also shown that the offset between the bcgs and the x - ray centroid connected to the presence of cool cores , such that the groups with a large offset between the x - ray centroid and the bgg location lack cool cores .",
    "moreover @xcite showed that fossil groups have lower gas entropy than non - fossil groups specially for the low - mass fossils .",
    "this is consistent with the lower entropy observed at the scc clusters against wcc and ncc @xcite .",
    "thus , one expects that fossils , given their relaxed nature , coincide with cool core clusters",
    "[ fig16 ] , [ fig18 ] and [ fig19 ] show that at least the distribution of the fossil groups is consistent with this argument .",
    "the large uncertainty in the radio luminosity of fossil groups sample prevents us from drawing a firm conclusion .",
    "fossil galaxy groups harbour bright bcgs in optical and infrared wavelengths .",
    "thus for a total optical luminosity of galaxy groups , and given the presence of a large luminosity gap , the share of the brightest group galaxies in the total optical luminosity is larger in fossil groups than in a non - fossil group , statistically .",
    "this is clearly seen in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] , [ fig12 ] and to some extend in fig .",
    "[ fig17 ] .",
    "in contrast when the total optical luminosity of the group is taken into account , there is no distinction between fossil groups and non - fossil groups and the 1.4 ghz and 610 mhz radio luminosity of the bgg scales with the total stellar luminosity of the groups ( fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] ) . as mentioned in section [ sec : oldagn ] , this behaviour might have an origin in special formation scenario for fossils or might simply indicate that the radio luminosity is more correlated with group and clusters properties than their bcgs .",
    "we note that while generally the bolometric radio luminosities does not correlate to the clusters parameters , the concise classification of the sample into scc , wcc and ncc according to the core cooling time shows that other parameter , in this case the cooling time , play a role .",
    "a lack of correlation between radio luminosity and cluster mass @xcite , optical luminosity of bcgs @xcite and agns @xcite are also reported .",
    "fossil galaxy groups are archetypal virilised galaxy systems with smooth and undisturbed x - ray morphology , indicating the absence of a recent group scale merger , and a giant elliptical galaxy dominating optical luminosity of the group , that the brightest group galaxy has not experienced a recent galaxy major merger .",
    "they are thus ideal laboratories for studying igm heating and cooling .",
    "we study a sample of 5 fossil galaxy groups at 610  mhz and 1.4  ghz using their gmrt observations . in two cases ,",
    "eso 3060170 and rx j1416.4 + 2315 , radio lobes , as signs of recent agn activities , are detected .",
    "we estimate heating rates via agn mechanical , shock and vortex heating .",
    "1- the mechanical power of agns are estimated by calculating the pdv on the igm via radio lobes expansion and movement .",
    "we deduced a range of mechanical power corresponding to an overpressure factors of 2 and 10 .",
    "the heating power is not sufficient to keep igm from cooling within @xmath13 , in which the cooling time falls below the hubble time , however , it is quit sufficient to account for the x - ray loss in the cool core radius , @xmath14 , where the temperature starts to fall towards the centre of the group .",
    "radio bubbles in our sample migrate from the centre of the galaxy , up to the cool core radius , @xmath14 , thus powerful enough to stop their surrounding gas from cooling .",
    "thus other sources of heating are necessary , specially in larger distances from the centre .",
    "2- the agn shock power in eso 3060170 is @xmath371@xmath38 erg s@xmath3 enough to heat the igm within @xmath14 but still much less than the x - ray loss within the cooling radius .",
    "3-vortex heating is the least efficient as its heating power is an order of magnitude smaller than the amonut needed to quench cooling in the core even within the cool core radius , @xmath14 .",
    "one could argue that the low efficiency of the agn heating in our fossil sample galaxies could fundamentally be a consequence of lack of recent galaxy mergers with the giant elliptical galaxy in these systems . in this argument ,",
    "galaxy merger is viewed as an agn fuelling mechanism which results in a more powerful cycles of agn outburst . to probe this",
    ", we compared our sample with a sample of galaxy groups and clusters from @xcite .",
    "the results show mechanical powers in fossil and non - fossil objects do not differ significantly ( fig . [ fig15 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , drawing any firm conclusion requires a statistically larger sample of fossil galaxy groups .",
    "heat conduction and turbulent gas motions , induced by merger , agn outburst or motions of galaxies @xcite are among the candidates that can heat up igm on their own and/or in combinations with agns mechanical heating .",
    "unlike the agn heating , these sources of energy can distribute the heat supply symmetrically .",
    "our estimation of the heating through conduction at the centre of fossil galaxy group eso 3060170 shows that , neglecting magnetic field , this source of energy is ten times more powerful to heat up cool core but poorly understood magnetic field still leaves the challenge unsolved .",
    "we studied feeding mechanisms of super massive black hole . for eso 3060170",
    ", the bondi power is larger than agn power .",
    "spin powered feedback is also possible since a rotating black hole with spin parameter a = 0.002 can send out jets as energetic as the one observed in eso 3060170 and rx j1416.4 + 2315 .",
    "the 1.4 ghz and the 610 mhz luminosity of fossil sample were compared with a non - fossil group sample @xcite , for a given total stellar mass of the group and also for a given stellar mass of the brightest group galaxy . the results ( figs .",
    "[ fig11]- [ fig14 ] ) demonstrate that the fossil brightest group galaxies are under luminous in radio luminosity , for a given @xmath0-band luminosity of the dominant galaxy",
    ". however , when the total stellar mass of the group is taken into account , fossil and non - fossil samples are inseparable in the @xmath73-@xmath74 plane .",
    "about 40@xmath7528 per cent of fossils and 44@xmath76 16 per cent of @xcite groups are radio loud ( @xmath77 w hz@xmath3 ) .",
    "we also compared total radio luminosity of fossil galaxy groups with the same from hiflugcs for a given black hole mass , classical mass deposition rate , x - ray bolometric luminosity and the group halo mass ( @xmath71 ) .",
    "while there is a large statistical uncertainties given the size of the sample , it appears that the distribution of fossil galaxy groups , which we except to be ideal environments for the formation of the cool cores , is not inconsistent with the distribution of the strong cool core clusters in various scaling relations based on the above properties of clusters .",
    "our results suggest that group property has direct impact on the radio outburst of the agn and thus the radio luminosity of a giant elliptical galaxy is environment dependent .",
    "we already know that a higher fraction of radio loud agns are observed in galaxy clusters and groups rather than in the field galaxies @xcite , however , the field galaxies are normally not very massive or optically luminous . in this contribution",
    "we show that fossil dominant galaxies , despite their high luminosity , are relatively less radio active . in figs .",
    "[ fig11 ] and [ fig12 ] we show that fossil dominant galaxies are strikingly under luminous in radio",
    "[ fig16 ] through [ fig19 ] take this to a next level arguably showing that the core of the fossil groups is subject to a strong cooling at the same time their central agn is less radio active than one could have expected from their stellar masses .",
    "there are evidences that the brightest group galaxies have non - boxy isophotes @xcite , which is consistent with the picture in which these giant elliptical galaxies are formed via multiple gas rich mergers early in their formation history .",
    "in other words , they are not a dry merger product . this has been challenged by a more recent study @xcite which find mostly boxy isophotes for a sample of fossil bggs .",
    "the study of @xcite is based on hubble space telescope observations and is the largest sample to date which suggests a connection between the luminosity gap and the nature of the isophotal shape of the bggs .",
    "the sample studied here largely overlaps with the sample of @xcite which finds the majority of the sample bggs to have non - boxy isophotes and as shown in this study they are relatively dimmer in the radio emission . while the shape of the isophotes can be used to argue for the lack of recent dry majors , minor mergers can continue to occur since the epoch of the major merger .",
    "if so , it appears that they do not contribute significantly to the feeding of the central black hole , as compared to the bggs in general population of the groups .",

    "h.miraghaei would like to thanks dr james anderson and dr thomas reiprich for their suggestions during the data analysis , the iranian national observatory project and the national elite foundation , iran , for partial financial support .",

    "<S> therefore , we discussed shock- , vortex heating , and conduction as alternative heating processes . </S>",
    "<S> further , the 1.4 ghz and 610 mhz radio luminosities of fossil groups are compared to a sample of normal galaxy groups of the same radio brightest ( bggs ) , stellar mass , and total group stellar mass , quantified using the @xmath0-band luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that the fossil bggs are under luminous at 1.4 ghz and 610 mhz for a given bgg stellar mass and luminosity , in comparison to a general population of the groups . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we explore how the bolometric radio luminosity of fossil sample depends on clusters and groups characteristics . using the highest x - ray flux galaxy cluster sample ( hiflugcs ) as a control sample we found that the large - scale behaviours of fossil galaxy groups are consistent with their relaxed and virialised nature .    </S>",
