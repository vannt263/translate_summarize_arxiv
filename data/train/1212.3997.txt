    "<S> these approaches indeed explain some experimental observations such as the quasilinear variation of conductivity with concentration of charge carriers @xcite . yet </S>",

    "<S> a sample will be insulating unless some source of scattering , like electron - electron or electron - phonon interaction , leads to a loss of the phase coherence on a length scale @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , in addition to the elastic mean - free path @xmath0 , the inelastic mean - free path @xmath3 and the localization length @xmath1 play also a fundamental role for the conductivity of graphene with adsorbates .    in this letter we develop a numerical approach for the conductivity that treats exactly the tight - binding hamiltonian and takes fully into account the effect of anderson localization . </S>",
    "<S> this approach gives access to the characteristic lengths and to the conductivity as a function of the concentration , the fermi energy @xmath4 and the inelastic mean - free path @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> in real samples @xmath3 depends on the temperature , or magnetic field , but it is an adjustable parameter in this work . </S>",
    "<S> our results confirm that sufficiently far from the dirac energy , and for sufficiently small adsorbates concentrations , the bloch - boltzmann theory and the self - consistent theories are valid when @xmath5 . near the dirac energy </S>",

    "<S> we consider two models for which the t - matrix diverges at the dirac energy ( resonant adsorbates leading to mid - gap states also called zero energy modes ) or is constant ( non resonant adsorbates ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that resonances can occur also at non zero energy but here we restrict to the important case of zero energy modes . </S>",
    "<S> the conclusions drawn here , concerning the influence of the energy dependence of the t - matrix for adsorbates , are useful for other types of local defects .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider that the adsorbates create a covalent bond with some atoms of the graphene sheet . </S>",
    "<S> then a generic model is obtained by removing the @xmath6 orbitals of these carbon atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example an hydrogen adsorbate can be modeled by removing the @xmath6 orbital of the carbon atom that is just below the hydrogen atom . </S>",
    "<S> this is the model of resonant adsorbate that we consider here . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the t - matrix associated to the adsorbate , diverges at the dirac energy hence the name of resonant scatterers . the non resonant model is constituted by two neighboring missing orbitals ( divacancy ) . in that case </S>",
    "<S> the t - matrix is nearly constant close to the dirac energy and does not diverge .    </S>",
