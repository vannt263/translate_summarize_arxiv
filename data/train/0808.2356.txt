    "in the research area of spintronics applications , heusler compounds have become of interest as half - metals , where due to the exchange splitting of the @xmath7-electron states , only electrons of one spin direction have a finite density of states at the fermi level @xmath4  @xcite . up to the present ,",
    "very few heusler superconductors with the ideal formula of ab@xmath0c have been found . in 1982 ,",
    "the first heusler superconductors were reported , each with a rare - earth metal in the b position  @xcite . among the heusler superconductors ,",
    "pd - based compounds have attracted attention because ypd@xmath0sn exhibits the highest yet recorded t@xmath3 of 4.9  k  @xcite . moreover ,",
    "coexistence of superconductivity and antiferromagnetic order was found in ybpd@xmath0sn  @xcite and erpd@xmath0sn  @xcite .",
    "a systematic investigation of ni - based heusler compounds seems to be worthwhile as nickel has many properties in common with palladium but tends more towards magnetic order due to the smaller hybridization of the @xmath8-states .",
    "in fact , elementary nickel is a ferromagnet .",
    "thus , nickel - containing heusler compounds with a high proportion of ni are naively expected to show magnetic order rather than superconductivity . however , superconductivity of ni - rich alloys nbni@xmath0c ( c = al , ga , sn ) has been reported some time ago , with transition temperatures @xmath6 ranging from 1.54  k to the highest recorded transition temperature of a ni - based heusler compound of 3.4  k in nbni@xmath0sn  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the two aforementioned pd - based compounds these superconductors do not show indications of magnetic order . currently there is a lot of excitement about the new high temperature superconductors based on feas  @xcite .",
    "the superconductivity of these compounds is related to two - dimensional layers of edge shared feas tetrahedrons  @xcite .",
    "these structure types can be understood as two - dimensional variants of the heusler structure .    a clear understanding of the origin of superconductivity , magnetism , and their possible coexistence in heusler compounds is still missing .",
    "to shed light on the relation between the electronic structure and the resulting ground state of ab@xmath0c heusler compounds we searched for new ni - based heusler compounds with a high density of states ( dos ) at @xmath9 close to the stoner criterion for ferromagnetism . a possible route for increasing @xmath4",
    "is the use of saddle points in the energy dispersion curves of the electronic structure .",
    "they lead to maxima in the dos , so - called van  hove singularities  @xcite . in order to identify such compounds ,",
    "we have performed electronic structure calculations using _ ab initio _ methods . in a simple approach following the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer theory ( bcs ) and neglecting any magnetic order",
    ", we would expect that the superconducting transition temperature of such compounds increases with @xmath4 according to @xmath10 if the debye temperature @xmath11 and the cooper - pairing interaction v@xmath12 are independent of @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , this van  hove scenario , where a maximum in the dos is ideally located at @xmath9 , was used to explain the unusually high transition temperatures of the intermetallic a15 superconductors  @xcite . the correspondence between @xmath6 and the valence electron count",
    "is known as matthias rule  @xcite . according to this rule",
    ", the high @xmath6 of the a15 compounds was related to electron concentrations of about 4.6 and 6.4 electrons per atom , leading to a maximum of the dos at @xmath9  @xcite .    on the basis of the van  hove scenario , we already found superconductivity in two heusler compounds with 27 electrons : zrpd@xmath0al and hfpd@xmath0al  @xcite . here",
    ", we report on the theoretical and experimental characterization of the new , ni - containing , superconducting heusler compound zrni@xmath0ga . additionally , electron - doped alloys zr@xmath13nb@xmath14ni@xmath0ga were prepared and investigated to obtain information about the dependence of @xmath6 on the location of the van  hove singularity .",
    "polycrystalline ingots of zrni@xmath0ga and electron - doped alloys zr@xmath13nb@xmath14ni@xmath0ga were prepared by repeated arc melting of stoichiometric mixtures of the corresponding elements in an argon atmosphere at a pressure of 10@xmath15  mbar .",
    "care was taken to avoid oxygen contamination .",
    "the samples were annealed afterward for 2  weeks at 1073  k in an evacuated quartz tube . after the annealing process",
    ", the samples were quenched in a mixture of ice and water to retain the desired @xmath16 structure .",
    "the crystal structure of zrni@xmath0ga was investigated using powder x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) .",
    "the measurements were carried out using a siemens d5000 with monochromatized cu k@xmath17 radiation .",
    "the electrical resistance of a bar shaped sample was measured using a four - point probe technique .",
    "the magnetization measurements below a temperature of 4  k were performed in a superconducting quantum interference device ( squid , quantum design mpms - xl-5 ) . for higher temperatures ,",
    "the magnetization was measured using a vibrating sample magnetometer ( vsm option of a quantum design ppms ) .",
    "the measured samples had a spherical shape with a mass of approximately 20  mg to 120  mg . in order to study the diamagnetic shielding ,",
    "the sample was initially cooled down to @xmath18  k without applying any magnetic field , i.e. , zero - field cooled ( zfc ) .",
    "then a field of @xmath19  mt was applied , and the sample magnetization was recorded with increasing temperature . to determine the meissner effect ( flux expulsion ) the sample was subsequently cooled and its magnetization measured in the identical field , i.e. , field cooled ( fc ) .",
    "the field dependent magnetization of zrni@xmath0ga was measured at a temperature of 2  k. finally , the normal - state susceptibility was measured at @xmath20  t in a temperature range from 1.8  k to 300  k. specific - heat measurements were carried out at @xmath21  k  @xmath22  k in magnetic fields of up to 5  t in a quantum design ppms with a @xmath23he option .",
    "the electronic and vibrational properties were calculated through the use of wien2k @xcite in combination with phonon @xcite .",
    "the electronic structure of zrni@xmath0ga was calculated by means of the full potential linearized augmented plane wave ( flapw ) method as implemented in wien2k provided by blaha , schwartz , and coworkers @xcite .",
    "the exchange - correlation functional was taken within the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the parameterization of perdew , burke and enzerhof @xcite .",
    "a @xmath24 point mesh was used as base for the integration in the cubic systems resulting in 455 @xmath25-points in the irreducible wedge of the brillouin zone .",
    "the energy convergence criterion was set to @xmath26  ry and simultaneously the criterion for charge convergence to @xmath27 .",
    "the muffin tin radii were set to 2.5  @xmath28 ( @xmath28  : =  bohr s radius ) for the transition metals as well as the main group element .",
    "a volume optimization resulted in @xmath29  and a bulk modulus of @xmath30 for the relaxed structure .",
    "this value is slightly larger than the experimentally observed lattice parameter @xmath31 ( see below ) .",
    "the results presented in the following are for the relaxed lattice parameter , no noticeable changes are observed in the calculations using @xmath31 .",
    "figure  [ fig_spagdos ] shows the results for the electronic structure from the _ ab initio _ calculations .",
    "typical for heusler compounds is the low lying hybridization gap at energies between 7  ev and 5.6  ev below the fermi energy .",
    "this gap emerges from the strong interaction of the @xmath32 states at the ga atoms in o@xmath33 symmetry with the eight surrounding ni atoms .",
    "it explains the structural stability of the compound .",
    "more interesting are the bands close to the fermi energy . in particular , the topmost valence band exhibits a van hove singularity at the @xmath5-point only 70  mev above @xmath9 . the result is a maximum of the density of states at the fermi energy ( see figure  [ fig_spagdos](b ) ) .",
    "a closer inspection of those states reveals that the singularity at @xmath5 is a @xmath34-type saddle point of the electronic structure with a twofold degeneracy .",
    "this degeneracy is removed along @xmath35 or @xmath36 . for both bands ,",
    "two of the second derivatives @xmath37 of the dispersion @xmath38 are @xmath39 and one is @xmath40 ( @xmath41-direction ) at @xmath42 .",
    "figure  [ fig : fig_phonon ] shows the calculated phonon dispersion and phonon density of states .",
    "the dispersion of the acoustic @xmath43 and @xmath44 modes is degenerate in the fourfold @xmath45 direction as well as along @xmath41 .",
    "this degeneracy is removed at the @xmath46-point and in the twofold @xmath47 direction .",
    "instabilities in the form of soft - phonon modes , as are observed for several magnetic ni - based heusler compounds @xcite , do not occur in the phonon dispersion relation of zrni@xmath0ga .",
    "this indicates the high structural stability of the compound compared to the ni - based heusler shape memory alloys ( for example ni@xmath0mnga ) .",
    "the high density of phonons at energies of about 30  mev is due to the vibration of the rather heavy zr atoms .",
    "these optical modes have no overlap with the remainder of the phonon spectrum and appear as einstein frequencies . in a hybrid einstein - debye model , this corresponds to an einstein temperature of @xmath48  k and a debye temperature of @xmath49  k taken from the density maximum at the upper cut - off of the optical modes .",
    "zrni@xmath0ga crystallizes in the cubic l2@xmath50 heusler structure ( space group : @xmath51 ) , where the wyckoff positions are 4@xmath52 ( 0,0,0 ) for zr atoms , 4@xmath53 ( @xmath54,@xmath54,@xmath54 ) for ga atoms , and 8@xmath55 ( @xmath56,@xmath56,@xmath56 ) for ni atoms .",
    "figure  [ fig_xrd ] shows the diffraction pattern for zrni@xmath0ga with the raw data above ( black ) and the difference between a calculated rietveld - refinement and the raw data below ( grey ) . within the experimental resolution of the diffractometer , no secondary phases were observed .",
    "the rietveld refinement results in a cubic lattice parameter of @xmath57   .",
    "the as - cast samples of zrni@xmath0ga were indistinguishable from the annealed ones in their xrd patterns , but magnetic , transport , and specific - heat measurements suggested an improved quality of the annealed samples .",
    "this improved quality of the annealed crystals was confirmed by resistivity measurements yielding a residual resistivity ratio of two , which is typical for polycrystalline heusler compounds .",
    "the specific - heat and magnetization measurements reveal sharp superconducting transitions of @xmath58 . at low temperature ,",
    "however , the measurements indicate small sample inhomogeneities or impurities .      the superconducting transition of zrni@xmath0ga was observed in measurements of the electrical resistance .",
    "figure  [ fig_rvt ] displays the temperature dependence of the resistance , which exhibits metallic behavior and a transition to superconductivity at @xmath59  k.    magnetization measurements using squid magnetometry were carried out to confirm bulk superconductivity in zrni@xmath0ga .",
    "the results of the magnetization measurements are given in figure  [ fig_squid ] .",
    "the upper panel ( a ) shows the temperature dependent magnetization @xmath60 of a nearly spherical sample in an external field of @xmath19  mt . a sharp onset of superconductivity",
    "is observed in the zfc curve at a temperature of @xmath61  k. the sharpness of the transition indicates good sample quality .",
    "the resisitive transition appears at a slightly higher temperature than tat determined from the magnetization measurements .",
    "this is a well known phenomenon : the resistive transition occurs when one percolation path through the sample becomes superconducting whereas the magnetic transition requires a certain superconducting volume .",
    "the zfc curve demonstrates complete diamagnetic shielding . for the calculation of the magnetic volume susceptibility",
    ", we used the demagnetization factor @xmath62 of a sphere .",
    "the deviation from the expected value of -1 ( 100% shielding ) is ascribed to an imperfect spherical shape of the sample and therefore an underestimated demagnetization factor .",
    "the fc curve represents the meissner effect for superconducting zrni@xmath0ga .",
    "the large difference between the zfc and the fc curves shows clearly that zrni@xmath0ga is a type - ii superconductor and points to a weak meissner effect due to strong flux pinning .",
    "figure  [ fig_squid](b ) shows a plot of the field dependent magnetization ( @xmath63-@xmath64  curve ) .",
    "the magnetic field was varied from -100  mt to 100  mt at a constant temperature of 2  k. the @xmath65 measurements exhibit the typical butterfly loop of an irreversible type - ii superconductor with large hysteresis due to strong flux pinning .",
    "an accurate determination of the lower critical magnetic field @xmath66 at this temperature is nearly not possible because of the broadening of the @xmath65 curves . a very rough estimation of @xmath66 , defined as the magnetic field where the initial slope interacts with the extrapolation curve of @xmath67 , yields @xmath68  k ) of approximately 16  mt compared to the upper critical field at @xmath69  k of 0.62  t.    figure  [ fig_ctb ] shows the electronic contribution to the specific heat @xmath70 of zrni@xmath0ga plotted as @xmath71 vs. @xmath72 in various magnetic fields .",
    "the phonon contribution to the specific heat was subtracted as will be shown below .",
    "the mean feature of @xmath71 is the specific - heat jump @xmath73 at @xmath6 = 2.83  k with a width of 0.1  k. the nearly perfect agreement between the differently determined @xmath6 values together with the large @xmath73 confirm bulk superconductivity in zrni@xmath0ga .",
    "an analysis of the jump yields @xmath74 , which is in very good agreement with the weak - coupling bcs value of 1.43 . here",
    "@xmath75 denotes the normal - state sommerfeld coefficient , which is discussed below .",
    "the energy gap is obtained from a plot of @xmath76 on a logarithmic scale versus @xmath77 , as shown in figure  [ fig_ct ] . a comparison with the bcs formula for @xmath70 well below @xmath6    @xmath78\\ ] ]    yields an energy gap @xmath79 of 0.434  mev for @xmath80 and @xmath81 , again in very good agreement with the weak - coupling bcs value . at lowest temperatures",
    "one can observe deviations from the expected behavior . as these deviations are sample dependent and clearly reduced in the annealed samples we attribute them to the aforementioned sample imperfections . in a more detailed analysis we compared @xmath70 at zero field with the calculated behavior of a bcs superconductor by using the approach of padamsee @xmath82  @xcite and the temperature dependence of the gap @xmath83 of mhlschlegel  @xcite .",
    "in this model , @xmath70 is estimated for a system of independent fermion quasiparticles with @xmath84dy,\\ ] ] @xmath85 where @xmath86,~t = t / t_c,~y=\\epsilon/\\delta_0.\\ ] ] the only free parameter , the ratio @xmath87 , was set to 3.53 .",
    "indeed , the specific heat can overall be rather well described by the weak - coupling bcs theory , as can be seen in figure  [ fig_ctb ] . to study the influence of the magnetic field we plot @xmath71 at a constant temperature of 0.5  k vs. the @xmath88 in the inset of figure  [ fig_ct ] .",
    "the linear increase of @xmath71 with @xmath64 corresponds to an isotropic gap , as expected for a cubic bcs superconductor .",
    "further @xmath89 measurements in various magnetic fields were performed to determine the upper critical field @xmath90 of zrni@xmath0ga . in figure  [ fig_bc2 ]",
    "the data are summarized together with those of the specific - heat measurements .",
    "@xmath91 was theoretically derived by wertheimer , helfland , and hohenberg ( whh )  @xcite in the limit of short electronic mean free path ( dirty limit ) , including , apart from the usual orbital pair breaking , the effects of pauli spin paramagnetism and spin - orbit scattering .",
    "the model has two adjustable parameters : the maki parameter @xmath92 , which represents the limitation of @xmath90 by the pauli paramagnetism , and the spin - orbit scattering constant @xmath93 .",
    "@xmath92 can be determined from the initial slope of the upper critical field @xmath94 or via the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath75 and the residual resistivity @xmath95 with : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the free electron mass and charge , respectively . from the data we extract @xmath99",
    "t / k and @xmath100 . with @xmath101 ,",
    "the curve estimated by the whh model follows the data points very closely , as is seen in figure  [ fig_bc2 ] . as the spin - orbit scattering counteracts the effect of the pauli paramagnetism ,",
    "this is equal to @xmath102 and @xmath103 , representing the upper bound of @xmath90 where pair breaking is only induced by orbital fields .",
    "consequently , the temperature dependence of @xmath90 can either be explained by pauli paramagnetism with an extremely strong spin - orbit scattering or with a dominating orbital field effect .",
    "the critical field due to the pauli term alone is @xmath104  t , which is much higher than @xmath90 in the absence of pauli paramagnetism @xmath105  t. hence pair breaking in zrni@xmath0ga is most probably only caused by orbital fields  @xcite .",
    "this is in contrast to other ni - based heusler superconductors like ni@xmath0nbga and ni@xmath0nbsn where @xmath106 is clearly larger than the measured critical fields and therefore the pauli paramagnetic effect has to be considered ( see table  [ tab_heu ] ) .",
    "the thermodynamic critical field was calculated from the difference between the free energy of the superconducting and the normal states : @xmath107\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}.\\ ] ] a value of @xmath108  mt is obtained . from the upper and thermodynamic critical field one can estimate the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath109 , which is the ratio of the spatial variation length of the local magnetic field @xmath110 and the coherence length @xmath111 : @xmath112 .",
    "the isotropic ginsburg - landau - abrikosov - gorkov theory leads to the values of @xmath113  nm and @xmath114  nm ( @xmath115 is the fluxoid quantum @xmath116 ) .",
    "obviously , zrni@xmath0ga is a conventional , weakly coupled , fully gapped type - ii superconductor that is best described in terms of weak - coupling bcs superconductivity .",
    "if a phonon mediated pairing mechanism is assumed , we can determine the dimensionless electron - phonon coupling constant @xmath117 by using the mcmillan relation  @xcite : @xmath118.\\ ] ] if the coulomb coupling constant @xmath119 is set to its usual value of 0.13 and @xmath11 to our measured value of 300  k we get @xmath120 , which is in good accordance with other superconducting heusler compounds  @xcite .",
    "now we turn to a characterization of the normal state properties .",
    "when superconductivity is suppressed in a magnetic field of @xmath121 , the sommerfeld coefficient @xmath75 and the debye temperature @xmath11 can be extracted from the low - temperature behavior of the specific heat , @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the gas constant and @xmath124 the number of atoms per formula unit (= 4 in the case of heusler compounds ) .",
    "the extracted debye temperature @xmath125  k agrees very well with the calculated value of 270  k and is in the typical @xmath11 range of other heusler compounds ( see table  [ tab_heu ] ) .    likewise in accordance to our electronic structure calculations",
    ", the high density of states leads to a strongly enhanced sommerfeld coefficient of @xmath126  mj / mol  k@xmath127 .",
    "in fact , @xmath75 is one of the highest values for paramagnetic ni - based heusler compounds ( see table  [ tab_heu ] ) .",
    "as already stated by boff @xmath82  @xcite , the maximum of @xmath75 in the isoelectronic sequence @xmath128 = ti , zr , hf of @xmath128ni@xmath0c ( c = al , sn ) is found for zr and in the sequence @xmath128 = v , nb , ta for v. as the electronic structure of all these compounds is quite similar , and consequently a rigid - band model may be applicable , the fermi level can be shifted through the appropriate choice of @xmath128 to a maximum of @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "this behavior and the comparatively large @xmath75 of zrni@xmath0ga confirm the van  hove scenario .",
    "the measured magnetic susceptibility @xmath129 as shown in figure  [ fig_m ] is nearly independent of @xmath72 , indicative of a predominantly pauli - like susceptibility .",
    "no sign of magnetic order can be found down to @xmath130k .",
    "even more , the low - temperature specific - heat measurements demonstrate clearly that apart from the superconductivity no other phase transitions occur down to temperatures of 0.35  k. the enhanced susceptibility corresponds to the high density of states seen in @xmath75 value as evidenced by the wilson ratio @xmath131 where we have set @xmath132 to its free electron values : i.e. , the land@xmath133 factor @xmath134 and the total angular momentum @xmath135 .",
    "the resulting wilson ratio is close to that for independent electrons ( @xmath136 ) .    below about 10 k ,",
    "a curie - weiss like increase of @xmath137 is observed for all samples .",
    "a fit of a curie - weiss law to the data yields a weiss temperature of -3.3 k and an effective moment of 0.06@xmath138/f.u .",
    "( assuming @xmath139 ) .",
    "this curie - weiss like behavior is sample dependent and can again be attributed to a small amount of magnetic impurities .",
    "it is , however , supervising that no appreciable pair breaking is observed as evidenced by the validity of the bcs law of corresponding states @xmath140 .",
    "finally , we want to discuss the influence of the increased dos on the superconducting properties of zrni@xmath0ga .",
    "although zrni@xmath0ga exhibits an enhanced @xmath75 compared to the value @xmath141  mj / mol  k@xmath127 of nbni@xmath0sn , both compounds have nearly the same transition temperature . obviously , the simple relationship between @xmath4 and @xmath6 does not hold .",
    "table  [ tab_heu ] demonstrates , likewise , that the upper critical field @xmath90 and the orbital limit @xmath142 apparently do not depend on the density of states in these materials .",
    "the influence of the increased dos on the superconducting properties is investigated from another point of view , which refers only to zrni@xmath0ga and the van  hove singularity in this compound : the fermi level can be shifted with an appropriate choice of @xmath128 , and the van  hove scenario yields a maximum t@xmath3 when the van  hove singularity coincides with @xmath9 . according to the electronic structure calculations , electron - doping of zrni@xmath0ga should lead to this desired conicidence .",
    "therefore , we doped zrni@xmath0ga with electrons in the @xmath128 position by substituting zr with distinct amounts of nb .",
    "the alloys zr@xmath13nb@xmath14ni@xmath0ga with @xmath143 , 0.3 , 0.5 , and 0.7 were prepared according to section  [ sec_ed ] .",
    "the crystal structures of the alloys were determined using a siemens d8 advance diffractometer with mo k@xmath17 radiation .",
    "all alloys were found to crystallize in the heusler structure ( space group : @xmath51 ) .",
    "the atomic radius of nb is smaller than the one of zr , and thus a decrease of the lattice parameter is expected upon substituting zr with nb .",
    "in fact , this effect was observed ( figure  [ fig_dopxrd ] ) .",
    "no impurity phases were detected in all alloys except of zr@xmath144nb@xmath145ni@xmath0ga .",
    "the small difference between the lattice parameters of zr@xmath144nb@xmath145ni@xmath0ga and zr@xmath146nb@xmath146ni@xmath0ga supports that a saturation of nb in the lattice of zr@xmath13nb@xmath14ni@xmath0ga is reached for a value of 0.5@xmath147x@xmath1470.7 . increasing the nb concentration above the saturation limit leads to a segregation of impurities .",
    "one of them was identified as elementary zr .",
    "the superconducting transitions of the alloys were analyzed in magnetization measurements using a squid as described in section  [ sec_ed ] .",
    "figure  [ fig_doptc ] shows the zfc curves of the alloys zr@xmath148nb@xmath149ni@xmath0ga , zr@xmath145nb@xmath144ni@xmath0ga , and zr@xmath146nb@xmath146ni@xmath0ga .",
    "zr@xmath144nb@xmath145ni@xmath0ga did not show a superconducting transition down to 1.8  k. this is not surprising because of the impurities , which were detected from xrd in this alloy .",
    "the other alloys show a trend of decreasing t@xmath3 with increasing nb concentration as summarized in table  [ tab_sub ] .",
    "it is therefore deduced that the nb atoms act as additional scattering centres that suppress the bulk superconductivity of zrni@xmath0ga .",
    "starting with electronic structure calculations , the heusler compound zrni@xmath0ga was predicted to have an enhanced density of states at the fermi energy @xmath4 due to a van  hove singularity close to @xmath9 . according to the bcs model , zrni@xmath0ga",
    "was therefore expected to be an appropriate candidate for superconductivity with a comparatively high superconducting transition temperature .",
