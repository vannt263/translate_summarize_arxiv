    "we consider in this article large deviations and related laws of large numbers and central limit theorems for a class of markov chains associated to the number of leaves , or nodes of degree one , in preferential attachment random graphs and random recursive trees , and also the number of  cherries , \" or pairs of leaves with a common parent , in yule trees .",
    "the random graphs studied model various networks such as pyramid schemes , chemical polymerization , the internet , social structures , genealogical families , among others .",
    "in particular , the leaf and cherry counts in these models are of interest , and have concrete interpretations . in subsection [ models ] , we discuss applications with these models and literature .",
    "define the nondecreasing markov chain @xmath0 starting from initial state @xmath1 , by its one - step transitions , for @xmath2 , @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a sequence of positive numbers such that @xmath5 with convention @xmath6 .",
    "additionally , we also consider two special sequences , @xmath7 and @xmath8 with @xmath9 , related to some applications .",
    "we first note , in this form , @xmath10 can be seen to represent the `` mass '' of red balls in a polya - eggenberger - type urn of two colors , red and blue , not necessarily tenable , where at each time @xmath11 , proportional to the red balls mass , a ( signed ) mass @xmath12 of blue balls is deposited , otherwise one red ball and mass @xmath13 of blue balls is added .    also ,",
    "when @xmath14 and @xmath15 for @xmath16 , the chain has interpretation as the number of leaves in preferential attachment random graphs with weight function @xmath17 .",
    "later , in subsection [ models ] , we also remark that @xmath18 can be taken as a random sequence with respect to the number of  generalized \" leaves , or  buds , \" that is those nodes , possibly with degree greater than one , which however connect to only one other vertex , in preferential attachment graphs with random edge additions .",
    "in addition , when @xmath19 for @xmath20 , @xmath10 is also the number of leaves in uniformly and planar oriented recursive trees respectively . in the latter case @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath10 is also the number of  plateaux \" in a random stirling permutation of length @xmath22 .",
    "moreover , when @xmath23 , @xmath10 can be seen as the number of cherries in yule trees .    as the urns add mass of the opposite color , one should expect almost sure limits for the mean behavior and normal fluctuations .",
    "in fact , by mostly martingale , combinatorial and urn methods , laws of large numbers ( lln ) and central limit theorems ( clt ) have been proved , at least in the examples mentioned above when @xmath18 is linear with slope @xmath24 ( cf .",
    "theorem [ t4 ] ) .",
    "see @xcite with respect to preferential attachment , @xcite , @xcite with respect to recursive trees , @xcite with respect to yule trees , and @xcite with respect to urns when @xmath24 is a positive integer .",
    "characterizing the associated large deviations is a natural problem which gives insight into the properties of rare events , and seems less studied in urns or random graphs .",
    "previous work has concentrated on analytic methods with respect to  subtraction \" urn models  not applicable in our general setting @xcite  or extensions of the dupuis - ellis weak convergence approach ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) to different allocation models than ours @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we note also some exponential bounds via martingale concentration inequalities are found in the case @xmath18 is linear with slope @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for other types of large deviations work in various random tree models .    in this context ,",
    "our main results are to prove a large deviation principle ( ldp ) for @xmath25 with an explicitly computed `` pressure , '' or legendre transform of the associated rate function ( theorem [ t3 ] ) .",
    "this is done in two different ways for the important case @xmath18 is linear with @xmath21 .",
    "such explicit computations are not commonplace , and our `` ode '' method is quite different from the methods in @xcite where a quasi - linear pde is solved , or in @xcite where a finite - dimensional minimization problem is obtained .",
    "perhaps a main feature of our work is that the method given appears robust and applicable in diverse , not necessarily urn settings . in particular , we show the ldp for @xmath25 does not feel the disorder in the sequence @xmath18 , is not dependent on the initial value @xmath26 , and is the same as for the chain with a regular , linear @xmath18 with slope @xmath24 .",
    "we mention that this is a consequence of a large deviation principle for the path interpolation of @xmath27 ( theorem [ t2 ] ) , perhaps of interest in itself , that we establish , by the dupuis - ellis weak convergence approach .",
    "in addition , aside from laws of large numbers which are trivially obtained , we prove a central limit theorem for @xmath10 through complex variables arguments with the pressure ( theorem [ t4 ] ) .",
    "these alternate proofs of the lln and clt , although indirect , apply when the mass additions take on some negative non - integer values where less is known in the literature .",
    "moreover , the results give a `` quenched '' lln , clt and ldp s with respect to  generalized \" leaves or buds in a preferential attachment scheme with random edge additions ( see subsection [ models ] ) .",
    "our technique to prove the ldp for @xmath25 is to consider the recurrence relation for @xmath28 $ ] obtained from ( [ z - def ] ) : @xmath29 dividing through by @xmath30 , we write @xmath31 the idea now is to take the limit on @xmath11 in the above display . when the  pressure \" @xmath32 exists , it satisfies @xmath33 . in this case , it is natural to suppose that the limits @xmath34 both exist .",
    "then , from ( [ recursion_divided_through ] ) , we can write the ode @xmath35 one can compute the solution of this differential equation ( cf .",
    "( [ pressure_2 ] ) ) and show it is unique .",
    "the main task is to show that the pressure and limits ( [ pressure_derivative_limit ] ) and ( [ exponential_limit ] ) exist .",
    "but , the pressure exists as a consequence of the path ldp for @xmath27 by contraction principle .",
    "we note , in principle , one can try to compute the pressure or the rate function from ( [ i path i ] ) by the calculus of variations , but we found it difficult to solve the associated euler equations ( cf . near ) .",
    "finally , we show ( [ pressure_derivative_limit ] ) and ( [ exponential_limit ] ) exist by extending @xmath30 to the complex plane , and then analyzing its zeroes and analytic properties .",
    "these estimates are also useful for the central limit theorem arguments .",
    "we now mention a different approach , in the spirit of @xcite , when @xmath18 is linear with slope @xmath21 and also interestingly @xmath36 , to compute the pressure from analysis of the generating function @xmath37 . from ( [ recursion ] )",
    ", we can write the linear pde @xmath38 one can solve implicitly this pde , and locate at least heuristically a singular point .",
    "then , formally , from root test asymptotics , the pressure would be the reciprocal of the location of the singularity .",
    "the difficulty is in establishing the analyticity of the solution and identifying its singularity . for urn models of `` subtraction type '' where the mass added is an integer , and which satisfies a balance condition",
    ", @xcite uses this program to obtain large deviations and the clt .",
    "however , the cases @xmath18 is linear with slope @xmath39 , and more generally the urns associated with non - integer @xmath18 are not covered by their arguments which seem to rely on integer additions with a certain  negative \" structure . on the other hand , we are able to supply the needed analyticity and singularity identification when @xmath18 has slopes @xmath40 , and in this way prove the ldp for @xmath25 ( theorem [ t3 ] ) in these cases .",
    "the plan of the paper is to state the results in subsection [ results ] , discuss applications to random graphs in subsection [ models ] , give the generating function proof of theorem [ t3 ] in section [ pt1 ] , prove the path ldp ( theorem [ t2 ] ) in section [ pt2 ] , give the ode - method proof of theorem [ t3 ] and prove the lln and clt ( theorem [ t4 ] ) in section [ ode_section ] , and conclude in section [ concludingremarks ] .",

    "preferential attachment graphs have a long history dating back to yule ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) . however , since the work of barabasi - albert @xcite , these graphs have been of recent interest with respect to modeling of various",
    " real - world \" networks such as the internet ( www ) , and social and biological communities .",
    "leaves , or nodes with degree one , in these networks of course represent sites with one link , or members at the  fringe . \"",
    "[ see books @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for more discussion . ]",
    "the idea is to start with an initial connected graph @xmath89 with a finite number of vertices , and say no self - loops ( so that the vertices have well - defined degrees ) . at step @xmath67 , add another vertex , and connect it to a vertex @xmath81 of @xmath89 preferentially , that is with probability proportional to its weight , @xmath90 , to form a new graph @xmath91 .",
    "continue in this way by adding a new vertex and connecting it preferentially to form @xmath92 for @xmath93 . here",
    ", the  weight \" of a vertex is a function @xmath94 of its degree @xmath95 .",
    "when @xmath96 is increasing , already well connected vertices tend to become better connected , a sort of reinforcing effect .",
    "our results are applicable to linear weights , @xmath97 , for @xmath16 , which correspond to certain  power law \" mean degree sequences .",
    "namely , let @xmath98 be the number of vertices in @xmath99 with degree @xmath100 for @xmath93 .",
    "it was shown , by martingale arguments , in @xcite , @xcite , and by embedding into branching processes , in @xcite that @xmath101 a.s . where @xmath102 from the applications point of view , the parameter @xmath103 can sometimes be matched to empirical network data where similar power - law behavior is observed .",
    "as the number of vertices with degree @xmath67 , or the  leaves \" @xmath104 , increases by one in the next step when a non - leaf is selected , and remains the same when a leaf is chosen , we see that @xmath104 corresponds to the markov chain @xmath10 with @xmath18 as specified below .",
    "since at each step the total degree of the graph augments by two , the probability at step @xmath11 that a vertex @xmath105 is selected is @xmath106 .",
    "then , @xmath107 and @xmath108 . here",
    "@xmath109 and @xmath110 are the total degree and number of vertices in @xmath89 respectively .",
    "one can also  randomize \" the model by adding a random number of edges at each step : let @xmath111 be a sequence of independent identically distributed random variables on @xmath112 with finite mean , @xmath113<\\infty$ ] .",
    "then , at step @xmath11 , we add a new vertex to the graph @xmath99 and connect it to a node selected preferentially from @xmath99 with @xmath114 edges put between them . the effect of these random edge additions is to randomize further the weight given the nodes in the graph ; the  deterministic \" model above is when @xmath115 . in @xcite , by embedding into branching processes , it was shown , when @xmath116 , that @xmath117 where @xmath118 is given by an integral formula with asymptotics @xmath119 .",
    "see @xcite for an even more general randomized model where also a lln is proved .",

    "\" that is , those nodes which connect to exactly one other vertex , albeit possibly with several edges linking them .",
    "leaves are those buds with exactly one edge connection .",
    "similar to the leaves in the deterministic setting , at step @xmath11 , the bud count increases by one exactly when the new vertex , a fortiori a bud , connects to a non - bud in @xmath99 , and remains the same when the new vertex links to a bud in @xmath99 .",

    "when the choice is made uniformly , the model forms a _ uniformly _ recursive tree .",
    "however , when the choice is made proportional to the degree , a non - uniform or _ plane oriented _ tree is grown .",
    "the interpretation is that in uniform trees , at each distance from the root @xmath124 , there is no ordering of the labels .",
    "however , in plane - oriented trees , different orders give rise to distinct trees ; that is , after selecting a parent node at random at step @xmath11 with @xmath100 children with a certain cyclic order of labels , there are @xmath125 locations where the new label @xmath11 can be inserted .    plane oriented trees are similar to preferential attachment graphs with @xmath126 ( cf .",

    "the code is of length @xmath22 , where each of the labels @xmath136 appears twice . adding a new vertex means inserting the pair @xmath137 in the code in one of the @xmath138 places .    in a stirling permutation @xmath139 ,",
    "the index @xmath140 is a plateau if @xmath141 ( where @xmath142 )",
