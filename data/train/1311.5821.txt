    "the @xmath2 correspondence @xcite has proven to be one of the most important recent developments in theoretical physics and , because of its strong / weak - coupling duality character , has become a useful tool for studying previously inaccessible physical systems where the usual perturbative approaches fail to apply . in this line of thought ,",
    "one of the most interesting and promising applications of the @xmath2 correspondence is in the area of condensed matter physics , where holographic techniques are expected to shed some light on the study of systems where strong - coupling forbids a quasi - particle description , such as in high - temperature superconductors .",
    "these models of superconductivity through holographic methods , customarily called _ holographic superconductors _ , have successfully reproduced some of the main features found in real - world superconductors , and form a rapidly growing area of study ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the effect of external magnetic fields on holographic superconductors was addressed since the appearance of the first papers on holographic superconductivity .",
    "most of the previous research was focused on @xmath3 dual field theories , motivated by possible applications to high temperature superconductors .",
    "however , it is of obvious interest to investigate the effect of magnetic fields in holographic models describing @xmath4 dimensional systems .",
    "another important reason is that the breaking of the superconducting phase by probing a system with an external magnetic field provides one of the main ways of classifying a superconductor .",
    "roughly speaking , a superconductor is said to be _ type i _ when the system goes from the superconducting to the normal phase in a first order transition as the value of the external magnetic field is increased beyond a critical value @xmath5 , all of this resulting in a separation between macroscopic regions of normal phase and superconducting phase in the material . on the other hand , a _ type ii _",
    "superconductor has two critical values : below a first critical value @xmath6 the system is in a superconducting phase , but as the value of the field is increased , a stable vortex lattice ( _ abrikosov vortices _ ) begins to form inside the material where the magnetic field can penetrate until a second critical value @xmath7 is reached and the system enters fully in the normal phase . in this case the phase transitions are second order in @xmath8 .    starting from a minimal family of holographic superconducting models in the bulk , the main focus of this paper will be to implement a phenomenological description of the dual field theory in terms of ginzburg - landau theory using holographic techniques .",
    "we will show that the ginzburg - landau description captures the basic features of holographic superconductors .",
    "we start by adding small scalar field and gauge field perturbations to these bulk models .",
    "we find that we can consistently determine a phenomenological ginzburg - landau lagrangian for the boundary theory , as well as the characteristic lengths of the system , and from this we can calculate the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath9 of the holographic superconductor .",
    "the value of this parameter will in turn allow us to determine whether the system is type i or ii . finally , we turn off the scalar and gauge perturbations and instead apply a constant magnetic field to our holographic superconductor by adding a finite magnetic component to the gauge field and constructing the gravity solutions up to second order in the magnetic field @xmath8 .",
    "this is done using the black brane solution described in @xcite , which we exploit for the first time in the context of holographic superconductivity .",
    "once we do this , we proceed to obtain droplet solutions of the system .",
    "there is some evidence that holographic superconductors describing @xmath3 dimensional field theories mostly exhibit type ii behaviour @xcite .",
    "the standard argument @xcite is that , when applying an external @xmath4 dimensional magnetic field to a @xmath3 dimensional system , the free energy needed to expel it scales as the volume , while the free energy that the system gains from being in a superconducting state scales as the area . in this @xmath3 dimensional case",
    ", @xmath6 must be zero dimensional holographic superconductor can behave as type i or ii , depending on the value of the scalar field charge . ] . from the holographic point of view ,",
    "a 2 + 1 dimensional superconductor under a 3 + 1 electromagnetic field is to be type ii because there is no way to exclude the magnetic field dynamically with the standard boundary conditions for the gauge field at the @xmath10 boundary , and therefore the magnetic field will be externally imposed .",
    "the holographic approach discussed in this paper describes @xmath4 dimensional systems using @xmath0 @xmath1 spacetime models . in a @xmath4 dimensional system subjected to a @xmath4 electromagnetic field ,",
    "both free energies scale with the volume ( see appendix ) , and hence there is a direct thermodynamical competition that can drive the system to a type i superconducting state .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce a simple model and briefly review the holographic superconducting regime , without any magnetic field present . in section 3",
    ", a magnetic perturbation is turned on through the @xmath11 gauge field of the bulk .",
    "also , a small perturbation around the bulk scalar field condensed solution is turned on .",
    "we show that the system can be consistently described by a ginzburg - landau phenomenological description .",
    "thereby we determine the ginzburg - landau parameter @xmath9 for different values of the charge @xmath12 of the bulk scalar field in our model .",
    "we also calculate the free energy of the system using the ginzburg - landau approach and compare it near-@xmath13 with the free energy calculated through the standard holographic techniques . finally , we compare the proposed ginzburg - landau approach with the methods developed in @xcite for computing the ginzburg - landau theory parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 . in section 4 ,",
    "we subject our system to a constant magnetic field solution .",
    "we calculate the critical magnetic field @xmath5 of the superconductor , and compare its near-@xmath13 behaviour with the results obtained in section 3 .",
    "we will work using a minimal phenomenological model in @xmath0 @xmath1 spacetime , in the same spirit as in @xcite , containing a scalar field @xmath16 and a @xmath11 gauge field @xmath17 @xmath18 where , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 .",

    "we will set @xmath33 for the scalar field mass , which is above the breitenlohner - freedman bound @xmath34 .",
    "this choice of mass appears naturally in top - down models of holographic superconductors coming from consistent truncations of supergravity @xcite .",

    "<S> we construct a family of minimal phenomenological models for holographic superconductors in @xmath0 @xmath1 spacetime and study the effect of scalar and gauge field fluctuations . by making a ginzburg - landau interpretation of the dual field theory , </S>",
    "<S> we determine through holographic techniques a phenomenological ginzburg - landau lagrangian and the temperature dependence of physical quantities in the superconducting phase . we obtain insight on the behaviour of the ginzburg - landau parameter and whether the systems behaves as a type i or type ii superconductor . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we apply a constant external magnetic field in a perturbative approach following previous work by dhoker and kraus , and obtain droplet solutions which signal the appearance of the meissner effect . </S>"
