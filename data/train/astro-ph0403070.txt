    "historically several different scales of long - term variability in cyg  x-1 have been reported .",
    "multiwavelength observations ( optical , radio , hard and soft x - ray ) between 1996 and 1998 established that a 150d signature is the dominant variability timescale which is suggested to be caused by precession and/or radiative warping of the accretion disk @xcite .",
    "recently this period has also been confirmed with earlier ginga data @xcite . from 1998",
    "onwards , however , this signature is not obvious in the soft x - ray flux anymore ( fig .  [",
    "fig : asm ] , upper panel ) : although mainly in the hard state , cyg  x-1 has been more active since before , i.e. , more flaring episodes during which the source can be found in the intermediate state ( = failed state transitions @xcite )  sometimes even reaching the soft state  have been observed .",
    "this goes together with a sharp and significant change in the properties of the short - term variability in june 1998 @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggested to avoid the distortion of the possible periodicities in the original data introduced by the high / soft state and the failed state transitions by truncating the rxte / asm lightcurve at 30cps ( threshold derived from visual inspection ) .",
    "they report a clearer detection of the 150d period in the 1996 to 1999 asm data . based on the principal idea of selecting only hard state data , we :    * perform a period search for rxte / asm data dominated by the flare - distorted phase from 1998 - 2001 , * use physical selection criteria derived from monitoring with rxte / pca since 1998 , * use two statistics for unevenly sampled data ( lomb - scargle psd and epoch folding ) , * also study the variability of the rxte / asm colours .",
    "our selection criteria ( lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : asm ] ) are based on the photon index @xmath1 of the pca spectra and the time lags ( between the 24 and 813kev flux ) , since they have been shown to be good diagnostics for failed state transitions @xcite . @xmath1 and lag",
    "are interpolated from the pca sampling to the asm sampling . in detail",
    "the states are defined as follows : ( i ) the canonical hard state is characterized by hard pca spectra with @xmath2 , ( ii ) spectra with @xmath3 are typical for failed state transitions , and ( iii ) for the softest spectra with @xmath4 , enhanced time lags @xmath5ms also point towards a failed state transition , while `` normal '' time lags @xmath6ms characterize the soft state .",
    "[ fig : all ] shows the lomb - scargle periodogram @xcite for all asm data between 1997 december and 2001 july .",
    "the analysis of the total count rate as well as of the three asm sub - bands is displayed .",
    "prior to the analysis , the lightcurves have been rebinned to a 7d resolution in order to avoid aliases due to the 5.6d orbital period .",
    "the dashed lines represent the @xmath7 `` local significance '' levels for a set of 5000 monte carlo white noise simulations ( for more details on the significance determination see @xcite ) .",
    "as expected , the 150d signature is not significantly present in the overall asm data .",
    "longer timescales seem to be more prominent especially a broad peak around  420d ( of course , increasingly fewer cycles are covered ) .",
    "however , there is already an indication here that the 150d period is still present from the data in the 5 - 12 kev energy band , also strengthening the idea of possible inner disk / radio jet coupling .",
    "after applying the selection criteria described above to keep only the hard state data , two types of changes are apparent from the resulting lomb - scargle psds ( fig.[fig : scargle ] ) : the significance of the 150d period increases in all energy bands and it can now be significantly detected in the total count rate . in parallel the opposite behavior is displayed by the 420d component : compared to the unselected dataset its significance decreases in all energy bands , most strongly in the hardest band where it decreases below the given significance level .",
    "these two trends lead to the 150d signature being the most prominent timescale of the total asm rate in the cleaned hard state .",
    "its presence is also confirmed by the results of an epoch folding period search , see fig.[fig : epfold ] .",
    "`` global significance '' levels are shown since they are not expected to deviate from the local significances .",
    "bottom panel : epoch folding analyses for the ryle lightcurves . ]    while the analysis of the overall 15ghz radio lightcurve  performed over the same time interval as the asm analysis  does show the presence of the 150d signature as a formally significant timescale , other nearby timescales arise with comparable significance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] , dark symbols and lines ) .",
    "since we are studying a non - canonical hard state ( changed short - term x - ray variability @xcite ) it is not a priori clear that a selection based on the x - ray states is also appropriate for the radio emission  although the tendency for radio flaring during failed state transitions is known . in this first approach",
    "we thus use a flux selection criterion ( 5mjy @xmath8 ryle flux @xmath8 15mjy ) and find that it helps to better work out the 150d timescale ( fig .",
    "[ fig : radio ] , light symbols and lines ) .",
    "the overall picture of the 150d period being present but buried by the flaring activity is thus consistent .",
    "however , from this radio dataset alone and using the preliminary flux selection criterion one could not determine the physical reality of the 150d period as compared to , e.g. , the 190d variability .",
    "note that a 1d - binned - lightcurve was analyzed here  leading to the presence of the 5.6d orbital period in the psd  and that the described effects are also present using 7d - bins , but are less pronounced .",
    "it is also interesting to perform the same period search on the asm colours , applying the hard state selection criteria ( fig .",
    "[ fig : colours ] ) : the 150d period is not visible at all , while the 420d timescale is clearly dominating . we cautiously suggest that while the 150d period is a pure intensity variation , there might be another characteristic timescale driving the soft x - ray flux , associated with spectral changes .",
    "note that this is true even after removing the failed state transitions themselves .",
    "this work has been financed by dlr grant 50  ox  0002 ( sb ) and by dfg grant sta  173/25 - 3 ( kp , tg ) .",
    "kp acknowledges support from chandra grant go-4050b and from the socit suisse dastrophysique et dastronomie for enabling her to attend the `` x - ray timing 2003 : rossi and beyond '' conference in order to present this work .",
    "the co - authors dedicate the presentation of this work to the twins , eric and marvin , who timed their birth allowing their mother ( sb ) to finish the analysis but suggesting that its presentation should be done by one of the collaborators ( kp ) ."
