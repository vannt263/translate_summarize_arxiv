    "the history of galaxy formation and evolution appears to be linked to the growth of cosmic large - scale structure . in the present - day universe ,",
    "clusters of galaxies represent some of the densest environments .",
    "massive and passive elliptical galaxies preferentially reside in cluster cores ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recent works have suggested that brightest cluster galaxies at the center of clusters at @xmath13 are relatively evolved and hence they experienced rapid growth at earlier epochs ( e.g. , @xcite ; ) .",
    "galaxy cluster archaeology and cosmological simulations suggest the rapid growth of massive ellipticals in high density regions at @xmath14 ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) . therefore uncovering intense star - forming activity in protoclusters at such high redshifts",
    "is of great importance for understanding galaxy and cluster formation in the era when they actively assembled their stars .",
    "such actively star - forming galaxies are expected to be enshrouded by dust , which renders them difficult to observe at rest - frame uv to optical wavelengths .",
    "their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) thus should be dominated by far - infrared ( fir ) emission , and therefore observing at fir to submm / mm wavelengths may be essential to uncover these dusty galaxies ( so called submillimeter galaxies or smgs ; for reviews , see @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "extensive efforts have been made to search for and identify such obscured star - forming galaxies in protoclusters at @xmath15 , using submm / mm bolometer cameras onboard single - dish telescopes , such as aztec ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , scuba ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) , scuba2 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , and laboca ( e.g. , ; @xcite ) as well as fir to submm / mm satellites , including _",
    "( e.g. , @xcite ) and _ planck _ ( e.g. , ) . while these single - dish telescopes are beneficial to cover wide area and find bright smgs , their relatively poor angular resolution ( fwhm @xmath16 ) and sensitivity limits due to source confusion have prevented us from obtaining accurate identifications for sources and/or revealing less extreme dusty galaxies .",
    "the advent of the atacama large millimeter / submillimeter array ( alma ) allows us to break through these limitations .",
    "contiguous alma mosaic imaging is able to open a window for submm / mm deep surveys with sub - arcsec resolution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we utilized alma to conduct a deep imaging survey toward a well - studied protocluster at @xmath3 in the ssa22 field .",
    "the protocluster was originally discovered as a redshift spike of lyman - break galaxies ( lbgs ) and ly@xmath17 emitters ( laes ) by @xcite , ( @xcite ) and was proposed as an ancestor of present - day clusters such as coma .",
    "a remarkable lae density peak ( @xmath186 times the average surface density ) spreading over tens of comoving mpc has been found among a huge filamentary structure ( @xmath19 comoving mpc ) traced by laes ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "distant red galaxies ( drgs ) and @xmath20-band selected galaxies are found to be more abundant in the core of the protocluster than the field , which supports the elevated formation of massive galaxies there ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . in the ssa22 field ,",
    "a number of submm / mm surveys have been conducted ( e.g. , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite discovered a statistical correlation between 15 bright 1.1  mm sources detected by aztec and @xmath21 laes and suggested that smgs preferentially formed within the cosmic structure .",
    "@xcite performed counterpart identification of aztec sources using radio and near - to - mid infrared data and derived optical to near - infrared photometric redshifts ( @xmath22 ) , which supported the trend found in @xcite and led to the conclusion that a significant fraction of the aztec sources are concentrated in the center of the protocluster .    on the basis of our alma survey , in @xcite we reported",
    "the discovery of a concentration of dusty starbursts and x - ray agns at a center of the protocluster , and suggested that the large - scale environment plays a key role in the formation of these rare and active populations ( see also @xcite ) . here",

    "our survey design and observations are described in  2 .",
    "we present the procedures for source extraction and catalog selection in  3 .",

    "hereafter we name this field `` adf22 '' , which is an acronym of `` alma deep field in the ssa22 field '' . adf22 is located at the very center of the cosmic large - scale structure ( or `` cosmic web '' ) at @xmath28 . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , this area is close to the projected density peak of @xmath3 lae candidates selected by subaru / suprime - cam observations with a narrow - band filter ( nb497 ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "previous works have unveiled not only the projected density distribution but the density structure in three - dimensions ( @xcite ) .",
    "when we only focus on spectroscopically confirmed @xmath3 laes and draw a three - dimensional map , adf22 coincides with the junction of a comoving 50 mpc - scale filamentary structure ( @xcite ) .",
    "this means that adf22 covers a node of the cosmic large - scale structure and provides a unique opportunity to examine galaxy formation in such a dense field at this early epoch .",
    "another important feature is that adf22 contains a significant numbers of the most active populations of galaxies which are suggested to preferentially reside in dense environments , including smgs , qsos , and lyman alpha blobs ( labs ) .",
    "there are three 1.1  mm sources discovered by the aztec / aste survey ( @xcite ; @xcite ) . prior to the present work ,",
    "one of the three sources , ssa22-aztec77 ( or smm j221735 + 001537 ) , had been proposed as a secure member of the @xmath3 structure ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) and the other two sources had been also suggested to be at @xmath21 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "one qso at @xmath3 discovered by @xcite and two @xmath21 labs listed in @xcite are also located within adf22 ( see also fig .  [ f1 ] ) .",
    "adf22 is thus an excellent region for probing dusty star - formation activity in a wide variety of galaxies at the core of the protocluster .",
    "we chose the central observing frequency of 263  ghz ( 1.14  mm ) , which is similar to that of our previous aztec / aste survey , 270 ghz , and allows direct comparison with the flux densities of sources from our aztec / aste and alma surveys .",
    "since the size of primary beam of band  6 is larger than that of band  7 , the frequency set - up is also beneficial to reduce the number of pointings compared to higher frequency . in order to cover a @xmath29 rectangular field",
    "contiguously , we utilized a 103-field mosaic .",
    "the spacing between adjacent pointings was 0.72 times the primary beam ( fwhm 23@xmath30 at 263  ghz ) , which was a compromise between the homogeneity of sensitivity and the observing time required to cover as wide an area as possible .",
    "observations were divided into two campaigns ( 2014 and 2015 runs ) , as summarized in table 1 .",
    "the first run was conducted on 2014 june 610 with 3336 available 12 m antennas in the c34 - 4 configuration ( longest baseline 650  m ) and very good 1.1  mm weather conditions ( precipitable water vapor ( pwv ) of 0.301.27  mm ) .",
    "the second run was done on 2015 april 4 , 5 , and 13 with 3240 12 m antennas in c32 - 2 ( longest baseline 349  m ) and good conditions ( pwv of 0.91.9  mm ) .",
    "the exposure time per pointing was 30  sec for each scheduling block ( sb ) .",
    "these observations resulted in initial on - source time of 24.5  min per pointing ( depending on the individual pointing ) and a total on - source time of 386 min .",
    "we utilized the time division modes ( tdm ) correlator , with @xmath31 dual polarization channels over the full 8  ghz bandwidth , giving an effective bandwidth of 7.5  ghz after flagging edge channels .",
    "the correlator was set up to target two spectral windows of 1.875 ghz bandwidth each at 15.6  mhz ( @xmath18 20 km s@xmath5 ) channel spacing in each sideband .",
    "the central frequencies of the four spectral windows are 254.0 , 256.0 , 270.0 , and 272.0 ghz .",
    "we note that this frequency range enables us to search for the @xmath32co(9 - 8 ) line ( @xmath331036.912 ghz ) at @xmath21 ( we actually found one co(9 - 8 ) emitter as we describe below .",

    "our analysis is complicated by the fact that our observations were carried out with multiple array configurations .",
    "our observations are composed of nine sbs as summarized in table 1 . since each",
    "sb has a different antenna setup , the resulting synthesized beam sizes differ among sbs .",
    "there are broadly two array configurations ; the maximum baseline lengths of sb6sb9 ( taken in 2015 ) are systematically shorter than sb1sb5 ( taken in 2014 ) . because of the difference in the observed area in 2014 and 2015 , the western edge fields ( fields 81103 in the right panel of fig .  [ f2 ] ) lack longer baseline data and have lower sensitivity ( table 1 ) .",
    "considering this situation , we first created a 1@xmath30-tapered map for the entire field ( i.e. , fields 1103 ) , which enables us to achieve nearly uniform angular resolution across the map .",
    "this larger synthesized beam is more sensitive to extended sources but suffers from an increased noise level . as we show in the maps of individual sources ( fig .",
    "[ stamp ] ) and measured sizes of bright sources ( table 3 ) , the resulting angular resolution , @xmath52 , seems to be sufficient to detect the majority of sources in this field .",
    "we also discuss the possibility that we are missing very extended components in  4.1.1 .",
    "the @xmath53-data for individual pointings were first combined into a single @xmath53data set .",
    "we then fourier - transformed the combined data to create a single `` dirty '' map with natural weighting , by setting the imager mode to `` mosaic '' and adopting the taper parameter , outertaper = 120 k@xmath54 .",
    "after we measured the rms noise level across the whole dirty map , we repeated the clean process down to 1.5@xmath55 , putting a tight clean box ( @xmath56 in size ) around each 5@xmath55 source ( in a manner similar to that reported by @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting synthesized beam is @xmath57 in size ( p.a . @xmath58",
    "we denote this map as the full / lores map .",
    "we created another complementary map . since the five sbs , sb1 ",
    "sb5 , have the longer baseline data with baselines up to 600 k@xmath54 , we can achieve a better sensitivity making the best of the longer baselines . for this purpose",
    ", we created a second map for 80 pointing field ( fields180 ) .",
    "we in general adopted the same procedure described above , but we did not apply any tapering to the map .",
    "the second map has a synthesized beam of @xmath59 ( p.a . @xmath58",
    "hereafter we call it the deep / hires map . in the following analyses ,",

    "the deep / hires map is used for detecting compact faint sources (  3 ) and resolving bright sources (  4.2 ) .",

    "this results in 7.0 arcmin@xmath60 area in the case of the full / lores map ( 5.8 arcmin@xmath61 for the deep / hires map ) .",
    "a sensitivity map was constructed utilizing an aips ( @xcite ) task , rmsd , calculating the rms for each @xmath62 pixel using the surrounding @xmath63 pixels ( or @xmath640 ) on an image prior to correcting for primary beam response .",

    "source extraction was performed using the image map and sensitivity map that were not corrected for the primary beam attenuation .",
    "first we utilized the full / lores map .",
    "a source - finding algorithm , aegean v1.9.5 - 56 ( @xcite ) , was used to extract positive sources above 3.5@xmath55 . in parallel",

    "the cumulative number counts of positive and negative sources as a function of signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) is shown in fig .",
    "we found 17 positive sources with @xmath65 and 28 sources with @xmath66 .",
    "there were no negative sources above 5@xmath55 , while we found seven negative ones with 44.6@xmath55 .",
    "the results show that the detection limit of 5@xmath55 is secure and conservative .",
    "gaussian statistics also support the validity of the threshold .",
    "since the map contains @xmath6732000 beams , we would expect less than one spurious peaks above 5@xmath55 . therefore we adopt these 17 sources as secure detections ( adf22.1adf22.17 ; see table 2 ) .",
    "we also performed the same procedures on the deep / hires map , independently . as a result , 14 sources were detected at @xmath65 , one of which was not detected in the shallower full / lores map .",
    "this source ( adf22.18 ; see table 2 ) was added to the catalog of secure detection because there were no negative sources with @xmath65 in the deep / hires map .",
    "therefore in total 18 sources were detected at snr@xmath7 .    in the following analyses and discussion ,",
    "we mostly focus on the 18 secure sources not affected by spurious features .",
    "we show a supplementary catalog of 14 sources detected tentatively in the full / lores and deep / hires maps in appendix  a.    the flux densities of the detected sources were measured with the imfit task of casa , using the map after correction for the primary beam attenuation .",
    "we adopt the integrated flux density as the flux density of a source unless it is lower than the peak flux density ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements of fluxes on the two maps are in good agreement with each other .",
    "the median ratio of the flux density between the full / lores map and the deep / hires map is @xmath68 for the 13 sources detected above @xmath69 in both maps .",
    "we performed a suite of simulations to evaluate the completeness and boosting effect on our flux measurement .",
    "we briefly describe the method below ( for more detail , see @xcite ) .",
    "model sources created by scaling the synthesized beam are injected into the image map corrected for primary beam attenuation . the input position is randomly selected to be @xmath70 away from @xmath71 sources .",
    "we then repeated the same procedures for the source extraction using the artificial map as described in  3.1 .",
    "the completeness is measured as the recovery rate of the injected model sources ; when an input source is detected within 1@xmath30.0 of the injected position with @xmath72 , the source is considered to be recovered .",
    "model sources with flux densities over the range @xmath730.020.6  mjy in steps of 0.02  mjy are considered and the procedures are repeated 1000 times for each flux density bin ( @xmath740.02  mjy ) .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ f4 ] as a function of input flux density .",
    "the completeness of our source extraction is @xmath75% at snr=4 and rises to @xmath76% at snr=5 .",
    "the completeness reaches @xmath18100% at snr@xmath776.0 .",
    "we consider the completeness in calculating source counts in  4.3 , although it does not matter significantly for @xmath65 sources .    in the course of the completeness measurement",
    ", we also evaluate the effect of flux boosting .",
    "it is known that the flux density of sources in a signal - to - noise limited catalog tend to be boosted as a whole due to random noise fluctuations and the shape of the source count distribution ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we plot the ratio of input and output flux density against the input flux density in fig .",
    "the results show that the effect is negligible if we consider only those sources detected at @xmath65 .",
    "hence we do not consider the flux boosting effect in the following discussion .",

    "several hundred submm / mm sources discovered by single - dish telescopes have been observed by submm / mm interferometers to date . some appear to resolve into multiple , individual smgs while others have a unique counterpart above a given detection limit ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) .",
    "for instance , @xcite reported that , using the sma , three of 16 scuba sources are composed of multiple objects . from alma observations , @xcite and",
    "@xcite suggested that @xmath183040 % of laboca or bright scuba2 sources ( with flux densities of @xmath97  mjy and @xmath98  mjy , respectively ) are resolved into multiple smgs brighter than @xmath991mjy , making most of components `` ulirgs '' .",
    "these results suggest that the relatively poor angular resolution of single - dish imaging ( @xmath100 ) causes significant source blending and complicate our interpretation of the nature of smgs .",
    "now alma enables us to resolve not only individual single - dish sources but also relatively faint sources spread over a wider area .",
    "the aztec / aste survey of ssa22 by @xcite and @xcite presented a 1.1  mm image of adf22 .",
    "the 30@xmath30 resolution image has a 1@xmath55 depth of 0.7  mjy beam@xmath5 , and detects three sources above a 3.5@xmath55 detection threshold within adf22 ( ssa22-aztec1 , ssa22-aztec14 , and ssa22-aztec77 ; hereafter aztec1 , aztec14 , and aztec77 , respectively ) .",
    "two of the three aztec sources , aztec1 and aztec14 , have two and five alma smgs located within the fwhm of the aztec beam , respectively .",
    "in contrast aztec77 has only one associated alma smg ( fig .  [ dist_alma ] ) . therefore the profile",
    "itself should reflect the two alma smgs .",
    "however , alma6 is located at outside of the aztec beam of aztec77 and so does not contribute to the measured flux of aztec77 significantly .",
    "hence here we treat adf22.3 as an unique counterpart of aztec77 . ] . in summary ,",
    "three aztec sources are resolved into eight alma smgs .",
    "the result is in line with previous alma studies following up single - dish submm / mm sources with interferometers , which reports that a significant fraction of submm / mm sources detected by single - dish telescopes are found to be intrinsically multiple smgs ( e.g. , @xcite )    to check the relative flux scales , we compared the flux density between the aztec sources and the associated alma smgs . for the aztec sources , deboosted flux densities in @xcite ( @xmath101 )",
    "are considered here . regarding the measurements for the alma smgs",

    "[ flux_comp ] shows the results for the three aztec sources .",
    "the ratio between the two , @xmath103/@xmath101 , is in agreement within error bars for aztec77 and aztec14 , which suggests that the alma smgs discovered from this survey account for the majority of the flux density of the aztec sources .",
    "however , the situation is not the same for aztec1 , the brightest aztec source in the ssa22 field , which has @xmath103/@xmath104 .",
    "the discrepancy could imply the existence of additional components of 1.1  mm emission not accounting for in the alma map .",
    "one possibility is that we are missing a number of fainter and/or diffuse sources ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "if we include sources in the supplementary catalog with snr=@xmath105 , then the flux ratio @xmath103/@xmath101 gets closer to unity for all three aztec sources ( fig .",
    "[ flux_comp ] ) .",
    "but these sources is still insufficient to explain the case of aztec1 .",
    "much fainter sources might also contribute to the aztec sources for aztec1 .",
    "@xcite gave us another clue .",
    "tamura et al . reported the 860@xmath4 m flux density of adf22.1 , @xmath106  mjy , using the submillimeter array .",
    "they obtained the natural - weighted synthesized beam , @xmath107 ( p.a .",
    "34.3 deg ) , and found that the source was likely not to be resolved .",
    "if we predict 1.1  mm flux density of adf22.1 using an averaged smg template from the aless survey ( @xcite ) scaled to the 860  @xmath4 m flux density , the expected value is @xmath1086.0  mjy .",
    "the estimate is broadly consistent with our measurement , which suggests that we are measureing the vast majority of the dust emission from adf22.1 .",
    "there are two alma smgs , adf22.5 and adf22.15 , located just outside of the beam for aztec1 ( fig .",
    "[ dist_alma ] ) . if we take into account adf22.5 and adf22.15 , the integral of the flux densities of the alma smgs approach the flux density of aztec1 ( @xmath103/@xmath109 ) .",
    "in order to investigate whether these smgs indeed contribute to the flux density of aztec1 in the aztec map , we made a `` model '' aztec image convolving the alma map with a gaussian kernel with a fwhm of 30@xmath30 .",
    "aztec1 has flux density 7.1  mjy in the model map , which is consistent with the sum of flux density of the alma smgs within the beam for aztec1 , not including adf22.5 and adf22.15 .",
    "therefore these two nearby smgs are likely not to account for the discrepancy .",
    "we do not consider a systematic error on the absolute flux accuracy for the aztec map throughout the above discussion .",
    "although it is difficult to estimate the influence for our small sample , alma surveys of a significant number of aztec sources will allow us to examine the effect .    as displayed in fig .",
    "[ dist_alma ] , we compared the spatial distribution of smgs discovered by alma and the contours of the aztec 1.1  mm emission , below the aztec detection limit ( 3.5@xmath55 ) .",
    "our alma map has discovered ten smgs outside the aztec source positions .",
    "we found that nine of the ten alma smgs are located within or in the vicinity of the area where the 1.1  mm flux density is 0    2.1  mjy  beam@xmath5 in the aztec map .",
    "this may show that the structure traced by the faint aztec emission , below 3@xmath55 , reflects the distribution of 1.1 mm sources to a certain degree .    as we reported in @xcite ,",
    "the aztec catalog is significantly incomplete at around 3.5@xmath55 ( i.e. , the detection threshold ) .",
    "the completeness of the aztec map is only @xmath110% at 2  mjy . among the adf22 sources with flux density @xmath182  mjy , two smgs , adf22.2 and adf22.5 ,",
    "are found to be located outside of the aztec beam .",
    "our results therefore show that alma mosaic has capability to find such bright smgs which was missed by previous submm / mm surveys taken with single - dish telescopes .",
    "there has been a debate on whether multiple individual smgs of sources which are identified with a single - dish telescope are physically connected or instead are just a line - of sight projection ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . for one source",
    ", @xcite proposed that it was composed of multiple , physically unrelated smgs .",
    "in contrast , @xcite showed that one aztec source fragments into two h@xmath17 emitters at @xmath111 , which supports the physical connection between the two ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggested that a portion of bright submm sources arise from physically related smgs since the number of detected alma smgs in the vicinity of the scuba2 sources are two orders of magnitude higher than the general field . on the other hand , recently @xcite claimed that physically unrelated smgs can also reproduce the single - dish sources in their semi - analytic model ( see also @xcite ) .    among 18 smgs in adf22 ,",
    "11 smgs have @xmath90 ( @xcite ; in prep ) , 10 of which are at @xmath112 ( table 2 ) .",
    "all of the brightest alma counterparts of the aztec sources are at @xmath3 and aztec1 and aztec14 have multiple alma smgs at @xmath8 within the aztec beam ( @xmath113 kpc at @xmath2 ) .",
    "these results favor that physically connected multiple smgs appear as a single single - dish source , at least in dense environment such as center of a protocluster .",
    "the overdensity of galaxies on such scales is conductive to mergers and dissipative interactions ( e.g. , @xcite ) and hence such small scale over - densities of smgs may indicate that smgs undergo merger - induced star formation .",
    "furthermore , there are other @xmath3 alma smgs outside the aztec beam across the entire field of adf22 ( fig .",
    "[ dist_alma ] , table 2 ) .",
    "this suggests that intense dusty star - formation may also be enhanced by the environment on a large - scale ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional gaussian fits to the alma smgs in the image plane using the deep / hires map suggest that adf22 sources are generally resolved .",
    "the results for the nine brightest smgs with snr@xmath9 are summarized in table 3 .",
    "the deconvolved major axes are 0@xmath30.25  0@xmath30.85 and the median value for the nine smgs is @xmath114 ( gaussian fwhm ; @xmath11 physical kpc at @xmath3 ) .",
    "seven of the nine smgs have @xmath115 , which leads the almost same median value , @xmath116 if we only consider such robust protocluster members .",
    "the size distribution in adf22 is generally consistent with previous measurements for smgs in other fields ( fig .",
    "[ size ] ) .",
    "@xcite measured the size for 23 bright smgs observed at 870 @xmath4 m and derived a median angular size fwhm=@xmath117 and @xcite reported that 13 smgs , which were observed at 1.1  mm and thought to be at @xmath118 , have a median fwhm of @xmath119 .",
    "these results suggest that dusty star formation occurs in compact regions , a few kiloparsecs in extent .",
    "there does not appear to be a significant difference between the size of smgs within the @xmath3 protocluster and other smgs .",
    "this might suggest that the local mechanism triggering intense starbursts does not significantly depend on the large - scale environment .",
    "the radio continuum also provides a tool to measure the scales of dusty starburst galaxies like smgs ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "these measurements shows relatively extended profile ( e.g. , a median of 5  kpc ; @xcite ) , which is larger than the bright alma smgs discussed above . up",
    "to date some explanation has been proposed .",
    "for instance , @xcite suggests that the relatively compact star formation is seen in smgs with higher star - formation rate ( sfr ) while main - sequence star - forming galaxies have different scales .",
    "@xcite indicates that the difference between the diffusion length of cosmic rays and far - infrared photons can account for it .",
    "deep and high angular resolution radio imaging in adf22 in the future will provide us with important clue to clarify the origin of the discrepancy between the radio and fir sizes of smgs .",
    "the flux density and measured source size allow us to derive star - formation rate surface density ( @xmath120 ) and investigate the condition of star - formation .",
    "we estimated @xmath121 [ 8 - 1000 @xmath4 m ] using sed templates of well - studied starburst galaxies ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) in the same manner as in @xcite .",
    "the sfr is in turn derived from @xmath121 using the empirical calibration by adjusted to the kroupa initial mass function ( @xcite ) .",
    "since adf22.2 and adf22.5 do not have @xmath90 , we assume @xmath122 ( a median value for aztec sources ; @xcite ) .",
    "finally @xmath120 was calculated using the size of the 1.1  mm continuum emission and the sfr divided by a factor of two , following @xcite ( table 3 ) .",
    "the median value is @xmath120=50 @xmath123 yr@xmath5 kpc@xmath124 , significantly lower than the predicted eddington limit for radiation pressure supported disks ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore starbursts seen in bright smgs in adf22 are not eddington limited as a whole . as some authors have noted ( e.g. , @xcite ) , if smgs have clumpy structure , the individual components might be eddington limited , as has been claimed from some recent high angular resolution alma images of the brightest smgs ( e.g. , hatsukade et al . 2015 ; iono et al .",
    "2016 , but see also @xcite ) .",
    "further observations capable of resolving sub - kpc structures ( @xmath125 angular resolution ) are required to probe such a scenario for the smgs in adf22 .      in this section ,",
    "we report the 1.1  mm number counts in adf22 , which is one of the most fundamental parameters in describing the evolution of this population .",
    "previously there have been a number of studies investigating submm / mm number counts from a variety of alma data sets ; laboca / scuba2 source follow - up ( @xcite ; @xcite ) , the use of calibration field ( @xcite ) , wide range of archival data ( @xcite ; @xcite ; ; @xcite ) , and contiguous mapping ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we present the number counts in a @xmath187 arcmin@xmath60 contiguous field in the remarkable high density region in the early universe , well - suited for investigating the environmental dependence of smg source counts .    to minimize the number of contaminants by false positives",

    "we excluded adf22.18 since the snr of this source is @xmath127 in the full / lores map . to investigate how the existence of the @xmath3 protocluster affects the counts , we calculated the counts in two ways .",
    "first we included all 17 smgs .",
    "second , we exclude the ten smgs with known @xmath128 ( table 2 ) and used only the remaining seven smgs .",
    "flux boosting effects were not considered ( see  3.2 ) .",
    "we corrected for the completeness of the source extraction , although the counts should not be significantly affected by the correction .",

    "as discussed in @xcite , the volume density of the alma smgs at @xmath3 in adf22 is at least about three orders of magnitude greater than the expected value in general fields .",
    "we now investigate whether the protocluster members affect the number counts or not , considering alma smgs at all redshifts . as shown in fig .",

    "the counts in adf22 are approximately five times higher than those found in aless at @xmath131 mjy ( @xcite ) and four to five times higher than those obtained at @xmath132  mjy ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the group of smgs at @xmath3 is undoubtedly responsible for this excess . on the other hand",
    ", we do not see an excess in the faintest bin ( i.e. , sub - mjy sources ) .",
    "a possible attribution is that the elevation of dusty star - forming activity in dense environment is significant only for relatively bright smgs ( @xmath133  mjy ) .",
    "deeper observation in the future will provide an answer .    here",
    "another question naturally arises .",
    "what are the counts in typical fields ?",

    "[ count ] ) .",
    "our counts excluding known protocluster members are in reasonable agreement with recent estimates which is ought to be relatively free of cosmic variance ; those from a number of calibration fields ( @xcite ) and those from a 2 arcmin@xmath61 contiguous survey ( @xcite ) . on the one hand ,",
    "those counts from the seven smgs seem to be several times lower than @xcite at @xmath139  mjy .",
    "one possible explanation for this discrepancy is that previous counts using 3 - 4@xmath55 sources are seriously affected by contaminants , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "another explanation involves clustering , although this effect may also contribute to our counts .",
    "the counts derived from serendipitously detected sources around other targeted galaxies might be biased or clustered as mentioned in previous papers ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our results suggest that the cluster environments are recognizable in the smg number counts . at the same time , there are still large uncertainties for submm / mm number counts , including field to field variation , the shape of dust seds , and absolute flux uncertainties .",
