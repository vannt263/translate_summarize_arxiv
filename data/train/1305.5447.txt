    "dileptons have long been proposed as one of the more crucial probes in the study of the hot and dense matter @xcite .",
    "leptons do not experience the strong force , and thus will have negligible final state interactions in a strongly interacting medium , with a mean free path that is much larger than the typical size of this medium .",
    "electromagnetic probes such as the dielectrons are emitted throughout the evolution of a heavy - ion collision . a typical dielectron invariant mass spectrum ,",
    "therefore , involves a plethora of sources , ranging from dalitz decays , which dominate the low invariant mass range , to drell - yan pair production which dominates at masses above 3  gev/@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , dilepton contributions originate from vector mesons , open heavy - flavor decays , and thermal radiation emitted from a quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the subsequent stages in the evolution of a hot and dense nuclear system can be identified with certain ranges in the dilepton invariant mass spectrum . in the high invariant mass range ( @xmath4  gev/@xmath1 ) , dileptons from the decay of the heavy quarkonia such as the @xmath5 and @xmath6 mesons provide a means to study deconfinement effects in the hot and dense medium .",
    "these contributions are on top of a continuum from primordial drell - yan pair production . in the intermediate mass range ( @xmath7  gev/@xmath1 )",
    ", the production of dileptons is closely related to the thermal radiation of the qgp . however , at higher center - of - mass energies this signal competes with significant contributions from open heavy - flavor decays such as @xmath8 , where such charm contributions may get modified by the medium .",
    "the prominent sources of dileptons in the low mass range ( @xmath9 1.1 gev/@xmath1 ) , in addition to the dalitz decays , are the direct leptonic decays of the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 vector mesons .",
    "the in - medium modification of the spectral shape of these mesons may serve as signature of chiral symmetry restoration .",
    "the @xmath13 meson is of special interest given that in thermal equilibrium its contribution to the low mass range is expected to dominate through its strong coupling to the @xmath14 channel @xcite .",
    "moreover , its short lifetime of @xmath15  fm/@xmath16 , will make the spectral shape of this meson especially sensitive to in - medium modifications @xcite .    at sps energies , the observed low - mass dilepton enhancement observed in both the ceres dielectron @xcite and na60 dimuon data",
    "@xcite could be explained in terms of in - medium effects on the spectral shape of the @xmath13 meson .",
    "moreover , the dimuon measurements by na60 are found to favor significant broadening of the line shape over a mass - dropping model . at top rhic energies ,",
    "the phenix collaboration measured a significant enhancement in its dielectron measurements , with a strong @xmath17 and centrality dependence @xcite .",
    "however , models that have been able to describe the measurements at sps energies are unable to consistently describe the phenix results in the most central collisions .",
    "the intermediate invariant mass range , between the @xmath18 and @xmath5 mesons , opens an important window to thermal radiation from the qgp .",
    "however , contributions from the earlier mentioned semileptonic decays of open heavy - flavor hadrons are significant and need to be accounted for .    direct photon measurements by the phenix collaboration in the range of @xmath19  gev/@xmath16 yielded a substantial elliptic flow , @xmath20 , comparable to the @xmath20 of hadrons @xcite . model calculations which include a dominant qgp thermal emission source significantly underpredicted the observed @xmath20 .",
    "however , incorporating a more detailed evolution of the hadronic phase , which involves the hadronic flow fields at chemical and kinetic freeze - out , appeared to improve the description of the direct photon @xmath20 reasonably well , while setting further constraints on the initial qgp temperatures @xcite .",
    "dilepton elliptic flow measurements as a function of @xmath17 have been proposed as an independent measure to study the medium properties @xcite .",
    "the combination of certain invariant mass and transverse momentum ranges allows for different observational windows on specific stages of the expansion .",
    "dileptons can be used to further probe the early stages after a collision and possibly constrain the qgp equation of state .    the installation of the time - of - flight ( tof ) detector @xcite and the upgrade of its data acquisition ( daq ) system @xcite , allowed the star experiment to extend its large - acceptance particle identification capabilities and increase its daq rate .",
    "the tof detector not only extends the reach of hadron identification to higher momenta , but also significantly improves the electron identification capability in the low momentum range .",
    "this , combined with the rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) program in 2010 and 2011 , has put star in a unique position to measure dielectron spectra in the low and intermediate mass ranges from top rhic beam energies down to sps center - of - mass energies . in this paper ,",
    "the preliminary dielectron results from the star experiment at top rhic energy , @xmath21  gev , are discussed as well as the preliminary results at several bes energies .",
    "the low invariant mass measurements are compared with recent model calculations .",
    "this paper concludes with an outlook on the future of the star dilepton program .",
    "the electron identification for the results reported in the next sections involves the star time projection chamber ( tpc ) and the tof detector .",
    "the tpc detector is the central tracking device of the star experiment and it provides charged particle tracking and momentum measurement .",
    "the energy - loss measurements , de@xmath22d@xmath23 , in the tpc are used for particle identification .",
    "the tof detector , with full azimuthal coverage at mid - rapidity , extends the particle identification range to higher momenta . the combination of the tof velocity information and the tpc energy loss allows for the removal of slower hadrons which contaminate the electron sample .",
    "the selection criteria for electron identification have been optimized for each rhic beam energy . with an additional track momentum threshold of @xmath24  gev/@xmath16 , the electron purity in the minimum bias au@xmath25au",
    "analysis is 95% .",
    "the unlike - sign invariant mass distributions , which are reconstructed by combining electrons and positrons from the same event , contain both signal and background contributions . especially in high - multiplicity events ,",
    "the contribution of the combinatorial background is large , see fig .",
    "[ fig : backgroundauau ] , and two methods have been used to estimate the background .",
    "the mixed - event method combines electrons and positrons from different events with similar total particle multiplicity , vertex position along the beam line , and event - plane angle .",
    "while the statistical accuracy of the background description can be arbitrarily improved by involving more events , the mixed - event method fails to reconstruct correlated background sources . at the lower invariant masses ,",
    "such correlated pairs arise from jets , double dalitz decays , dalitz decays followed by a conversion of the decay photon , or two - photon decays followed by the conversion of both photons @xcite .",
    "a background estimation based on the like - sign method can account for such correlated contributions .",
    "its drawback , however , is that the statistical accuracy is only comparable to the unlike - sign , _",
    "i.e. _ the original raw mass spectrum .",
