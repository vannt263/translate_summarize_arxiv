    "following the first reported detection of diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) some 80 years ago ( heger 1922 ) , several different approaches were made to the task of identifying the carriers ( see herbig 1995 or snow 1995 , 2001 for recent reviews ) . during the era of photographic spectroscopy ,",
    "the principal approach was to examine correlations of the strengths of the dibs with other interstellar quantities , but such studies rarely led to definitive conclusions ( snow , york , & welty 1977 ) . with the advent of electronic detectors in the 1970s , however , it became possible to measure the strengths and profiles of the dibs more accurately .",
    "differences in profile shape among the dibs and differences in relative dib strength in different interstellar environments strongly suggest that the dibs are due to a variety of carriers ( kreowski & walker 1987 ; josafatsson & snow 1987 ; kreowski & sneden 1993 ; cami _ et al .",
    "some uncertainties remain , however , as to which of the dibs are more closely related , because of differences both in the sightlines and dibs considered and in how the dibs are defined and measured in the various studies .",
    "the breadth of the dibs has often been ascribed to broadening by predissocation , but this requires the dib carriers to be continually replenished at a rapid rate to maintain the necessary density of absorbers .",
    "douglas ( 1977 ) and smith , snow , & york ( 1977 ) proposed a solution for this dilemma : the dib carriers could be large molecules undergoing internal conversion , a process routinely seen in laboratory spectra .",
    "laboratory and theoretical studies of small and large ( @xmath010 atomic nuclei ) molecules are now producing specific predictions of dib candidate lines ( e.g. , foing & ehrenfreund 1994 and galazutdinov _ et al . _",

    "our goal is to assemble a high - quality dataset  including dib strengths and many other interstellar parameters  for a set of sightlines specifically selected to sample a wide variety of environments .",
    "our hope is that with sufficient data quality ( allowing us to measure very weak dibs and fine details of the dib profiles ) , careful consideration of the continua near the dibs , and more complete coverage of the other interstellar parameters , we may be able to identify definite dependences and relationships among the dibs , between the dibs and other interstellar species , and between the dibs and specific physical or chemical factors characterizing the interstellar clouds .    in this paper ,",

    "snow & seab ( 1980 ) , mathis & cardelli ( 1992 ) , and mathis ( 1994 ) have speculated that such extinction curves are produced by the addition of a thin mantle overlying the small carbonaceous grains thought to be responsible for the bump and the far - uv extinction . while a strong water ice feature has been observed toward the more heavily reddened hd 29647 ( a@xmath9 = 3.6 mag ; goebel 1983 ) , water ice mantles may not significantly affect the 2175  bump ( mathis 1994 ) .",

    "comparisons of other interstellar properties for these two lines of sight are of interest .",
    "it is difficult to assess the atomic and molecular abundances toward hd 29647 , due to its later spectral type ( b8 v ) , its confusing spectrum ( hg - mn ) , the near - perfect velocity match between the star and the main interstellar cloud in the line of sight ( adelman _ et al._2001 ) , and the star s very low @xmath31sin@xmath32 , which makes stellar lines appear nearly as narrow as interstellar lines in most currently available spectra ( e.g. crutcher 1985 ) . there is insufficient far - uv flux for _ fuse _ observations , and it can be difficult to interpret , or even to identify unambiguously , some of the interstellar lines . owing to the breadth of the dibs , however , it is possible to determine the dib strengths toward this star .",
    "it was previously established that the 5780 and 5797  dibs toward hd 29647 are unusually weak , but might be present with very narrow profiles ( snow & seab 1991 ) .",

    "the dibs toward both stars thus are markedly weak relative to extinction , when compared to the dibs in most diffuse cloud lines of sight reported in the literature ( note that a@xmath9 = 3.6 mag for hd 29647 ) .",
    "there is longstanding evidence in the literature that the generically strongest dibs tend to be relatively weak in dense clouds ( e.g. , wampler 1966 ; snow & cohen 1974 ; adamson , whittet , & duley 1991 ; adamson _ et al .",

    "the dibs are also known to be weak , relative to extinction , in environments with intense radiation fields ( jenniskens , ehrenfreund , & foing 1994 ; snow _ et al .",
    "this combination of factors  dib weakness in dense clouds _ and _ in regions of high uv flux  leads to a picture in which the dibs form and survive most readily either in `` ordinary '' diffuse clouds or in the diffuse outer layers of dense clouds ( the `` skin effect '' discussed by adamson _",
    "_ 1991 ) . the weakness of the dibs toward hd 62542 and the suggestion of cardelli _ et al . _ ( 1990 ) that the more diffuse outer layers of the dense cloud toward hd 62542 have been stripped off are consistent with this scenario .    of the sightlines considered in this paper , the three with `` normal '' dib strengths per unit @xmath8 ( hd 215733 , @xmath24 cas , hd 183143 ) all have a number of interstellar components  of roughly comparable strength and",

    "the carriers of the dibs considered here thus seem to require a relatively low density and/or ( at most ) a moderately intense radiation field ( cami _ et al .",

    "correlations between the strengths of the 5780 and 5797  dibs , @xmath10(h ) , @xmath10 ( ) , and @xmath10 ( ) suggest that the dib carriers generally behave like dominant ions  though the weakness of those dibs toward stars in sco - oph and in the orion trapezium region is reminiscent of the weakness of the trace neutral species there ( herbig 1993 ; welty & hobbs 2001 ) .",

    "such patterns are consistent with suggestions that the dib carriers are molecular ions  which are destroyed ( through electron attachment ) in dense environments ( e.g. , toward hd 62542 ) or which are not formed or maintained in clouds with weak radiation fields ( e.g. , leger & dhendecourt 1985 ; crawford , tielens , & allamandola 1985 ; van der zwet & allamandola 1985 ; salama _ et al .",

    "we hypothesize instead that the part of the main cloud toward hd 62542 that is conducive to the formation and survival of dibs is unusually thin , sandwiched between the dense cloud that dominates the molecular absorption and the hot , low - density gas of the gum nebula in which that cloud is immersed . in this view",

    "a number of the diffuse interstellar bands ( at 5780 , 5797 , 6270 , 6284 , and 6614  ) commonly seen even in relatively lightly reddened lines of sight appear to be essentially absent toward the moderately reddened star hd 62542 , previously known to exhibit both strong interstellar molecular lines and an unusually steep far - uv extinction curve with a weak , shifted 2175  bump .",
    "the line of sight appears to be dominated by a single small , very dense cloud , whose more diffuse outer layers may have been stripped by stellar winds and/or shocks within the gum nebula .    comparisons of those five moderately strong dibs in six lines of sight indicate that the strengths of the dibs are not well correlated with a@xmath9 , but must depend on other ( as yet undetermined ) properties of the interstellar clouds",
    ". for this small sample , the bands are weaker , per unit a@xmath9 , for sightlines with strong cn and weak ch@xmath2 , relative to ch ( hd 29647 , hd 62542 ) , and are stronger for sightlines with weak cn and strong ch@xmath2 ( @xmath24 cas , hd 183143 )  consistent with reduced abundances of the carriers of these dibs in denser gas .",
    "[ we note that our larger sample suggests that different dibs can show somewhat different dependences on @xmath10(ch@xmath2)/@xmath10(cn ) , however .",
    "] moreover , the dibs are weaker when the far - uv extinction is either very steep , and the radiation fields not enhanced ( hd 62542 , hd 29647 ) _ or _ very shallow , with a strong ambient field ( @xmath25 ori c ) ; the other sightline with relatively weak dibs ( @xmath28 oph d ) has moderately shallow far - uv extinction and ( probably ) a somewhat enhanced radiation field .",

    "<S> as part of an extensive survey of diffuse interstellar bands ( dibs ) , we have obtained optical spectra of the moderately reddened b5v star hd 62542 , which is known to have an unusual uv extinction curve of the type usually identified with dark clouds . </S>",
    "<S> the typically strongest of the commonly catalogued dibs covered by the spectra  those at 5780 , 5797 , 6270 , 6284 , and 6614   are essentially absent in this line of sight , in marked contrast with other lines of sight of similar reddening . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the hd 62542 line of sight with others exhibiting a range of extinction properties and molecular abundances and interpret the weakness of the dibs as an extreme case of deficient dib formation in a dense cloud whose more diffuse outer layers have been stripped away . </S>",
