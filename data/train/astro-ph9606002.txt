    "observations of diffuse dust in galaxies impact on some basic questions about their present structure and past history . in particular , are we missing significant amounts of luminous matter because of the effects of dust extinction ?",
    "how much severe are the corresponding selection effects ?    traditional approaches to investigate dust in galaxies rely on either _",
    "( a ) _ indirect estimates based on dust extinction effects in the optical and near - ir , or _ ( b ) _ direct measurements of dust emission from fir / mm observations",
    ". neither have provided conclusive results at the moment : the former method is based on model - dependent and controversial assumptions about the optical - ir spectrum of various galactic components , the latter still lacks a large enough statistical basis and suffers from the observational uncertainties of the sub-_mm_/_mm _ data .",
    "we have tackled the question of the dust content of spirals by observing the 1.25 _ mm _ continuum emission from a complete sample of iras galaxies with the sest telescope .",
    "the sest telescope was chosen as it provided the best compromise between detector sensitivity and spatial resolution ( see for more details franceschini & andreani 1995 ) .",
    "our observations allowed us to directly estimate , for the first time , the long-@xmath0 spectrum of galaxies ( see figure 3 below ) in a poorly explored spectral domain .",
    "we interpret the fir / mm spectra exploiting a standard dust model .",
    "two major dust components are assumed to be present in the ism : a cold `` cirrus '' component and warm dust in star - forming regions .",
    "sixteen galaxies , hereafter called _",
    "`` cirrus''-dominated _ , have a negligible contribution of warm dust at 100 @xmath1 , while the other 14 objects require high values of the warm dust fraction and their spectrum at @xmath2 is dominated by the starburst component .",
    "fir/_mm _ data and a reliable dust model provide a straightforward way to classify galaxies according to their star formation activity .",
    "the starburst component contributes only a couple of percent on average of the total dust mass , while the cold component bears 97 % of the total mass .",
    "figure 1 shows the extinction estimated from our data versus the observed b - band optical depth .",
    "this was found from the total dust mass divided by the galaxy projected area and measures the amount of dust _",
    "available _ to absorb the optical light .",
    "@xmath3 measures the overall _ actual _ effect of extinction and was estimated from the logarithmic ratio of the bolometric optical - uv luminosity to the bolometric uv / fir light .",
    "two galaxy classes are significantly segregated over this plane : the inactive",
    "_ `` cirrus''-dominated _ objects being confined to lower values of dust optical depth ( @xmath4 ) and low extinction ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the active star - forming galaxies , on the contrary , are spread over much larger values in both axes .",
    "appreciable amounts of dust and extinction seem to characterize only the population of starbursting galaxies .",
    "this may reflect a more exhaustive processing of the ism through star - formation in the latter objects than for the average _ inactive _ spiral .",
    "we find the mm emission for our sample galaxies to be very well correlated with the 60 and 100 @xmath1 ones .",
    "the estimate of the mm local luminosity functions ( llf ) is then straightforward , in the presence of a complete flux - limited sample .",
    "we report in figure 2 the llfs at 60 and 1300 @xmath1 derived from our sample .",
    "the good match of our 60 @xmath1 llf with published data ( saunders et al .",
    "1990 ) emphasizes the completeness and reliability of the sample .",
    "the 1300 @xmath1 llfs were derived from those at 60 @xmath1 by means of the bivariate ir / mm luminosity distribution ( open and filled squares ) , and from a simple scaling of the 60 @xmath1 one to 1300 @xmath1 through a constant @xmath6 luminosity ratio ( thick line ) .",
    "the three estimates are consistent within the errors .",
    "a precise knowledge of the llf allows a model - independent estimate of the minimal contribution of galaxies to the ir - mm extragalactic bkg .",
    "this minimal estimate , which is proportional to the local volume emissivity @xmath7 , was computed assuming no evolution and that galaxies exist only up to z=1 .",
    "the minimal galaxy bkg is shown in fig . 3 as the lower shaded region : given such conservative assumptions , the real extragalactic bkg is quite likely in excess of this .",
    "note that , because of the strong k - correction effect for even such low - z objects , this spectrum is much broader than the average local long-@xmath0 spectral emissivity of galaxies @xmath8 .",
    "the upper shaded region in fig .",
    "3 is a recent estimate ( puget et al .",
    "1996 ) of the extragalactic bkg in the sub - mm cosmological window , where the foreground emissions from the galaxy and the interplanetary dust and the cosmic bkg radiation are at the minimum .",
    "there is a wide margin between this and our minimal bkg , which may indicate strong evolution .    in principle",
    ", the comparison between the local emissivity @xmath8 and the bkg spectrum allows inferences about the average redshift of the emitting sources . in practice ,",
    "significant uncertainty is introduced by the spectral evolution with cosmic time .",
    "3 reports two predictions corresponding to quite different models of galaxy formation and evolution : a merging scheme ( with most of the flux contributed by @xmath9 , dashed line ) and a pure luminosity evolution model ( with contributions at @xmath10 , continuous line ) .",
    "the two predict quite similar bkg s , the former assuming a constant source spectrum , the latter one getting warmer in the past following the higher star - formation rate and the increased average radiation field ."
