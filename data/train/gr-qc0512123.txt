    "as it is well known , general relativity theory ( gr ) does not lead to restrictions for admissible energy densities in the case of gravitating systems with positive values of energy density and pressure satisfying energy dominance condition . as a result , the problem of gravitational singularities takes place in the frame of gr [ 1 ] .",
    "the appearance of nonphysical state with divergent energy density limiting world lines in the past or in the future is characteristic feature of friedmannian cosmological models ( problem of cosmological singularity - pcs ) and also of collapsing systems . from physical point of view",
    ", the problem of gravitational singularities is connected with the fact that gravitational interaction in the case of gravitating systems with positive energy densities and pressures in the frame of gr as well as newton s theory of gravitation has the character of attraction but not repulsion .",
    "note that gravitational interaction in gr can have the repulsion character in the case of gravitating systems with negative pressure ( for example systems including massive or nonlinear scalar fields ) . according to accepted opinion , it is possible cause of acceleration of cosmological expansion at present epoch .",
    "however , such effect does not permit to solve the pcs in the frame of gr [ 2 ] : all friedmannian cosmological models of flat and open type , and the most part of closed models are singular .",
    "there were many attempts to solve the problem of gravitational singularities and at first of all the pcs in the frame of gr and other classical theories of gravitation ; a number of particular regular cosmological solutions was obtained ( see [ 3 ] and references given herein ) . in connection with this note that the solution of pcs means not only obtaining regular cosmological solutions , but also excluding singular solutions ; as a result regular behaviour of cosmological solutions has to be their characteristic feature .",
    "the most existent attempts to solve the pcs do not satisfy indicated conditions . according to wide known opinion",
    ", the solution of pcs and generally of the problem of gravitational singularities of gr has to be connected with quantum gravitational effects , which must be essential at planckian conditions , when energy density is comparable with planckian one .",
    "previously some regular bouncing cosmological solutions were obtained in the frame of candidates to quantum gravitation theory  string theory / m - theory and loop quantum gravity ( see , for example , [ 46 ] ) . from physical point of view , these solutions have some difficulties [ 7 ] . in the case of bouncing cosmological solutions built in the frame of string theory the condition of energy density positivity for gravitating matter",
    "is violated . in the case of loop quantum cosmology",
    "a bounce takes place for microscopic model having a volume comparable with planckian one .",
    "if one supposes that universe at compression stage is macroscopic object , one has to explain the transformation of macro - universe into micro - universe before a bounce , this means one has to introduce some model inverse to inflation .",
    "as it was shown in a number of papers ( see [ 7 , 16 ] and references given herein ) , gauge theories of gravitation ( gtg ) and at first of all the poincare gtg , which are natural generalization of gr by applying the gauge approach to gravitational interaction [ 8,9 ] , offer an opportunity to solve the pcs .",
    "all homogeneous isotropic cosmological models including inflationary models are regular in metrics , hubble parameter , its time derivative by certain restriction on equation of state for gravitating matter at extreme conditions . unlike friedmannian models of gr nonphysical state with divergent energy density",
    "does not appear because of gravitational repulsion effect at extreme conditions , which takes place in gtg in the case of usual gravitating systems with positive energy densities satisfying energy dominance condition .",
    "the present paper is devoted to analysis of gravitational repulsion effect at extreme conditions in the frame of gtg in the case of homogeneous isotropic gravitating systems . in section 2 some important properties of homogeneous isotropic models in the frame of poincare gtg",
    "are briefly discussed . in section 3 generalized cosmological friedmann equations without specific solutions for such models filled by usual matter and",
    "scalar fields are deduced . in section 4",
    "extreme conditions leading to gravitational repulsion effect are analyzed .",
    "in the framework of gauge approach to gravitation the poincare gtg is of the greatest interest [ 8,7 ] .",
    "gravitational field variables in poincare gtg are the tetrad ( translational gauge field ) and lorentz connection ( lorentz gauge field ) , corresponding field strengths are torsion and curvature tensors , and physical space - time is 4-dimensional riemann - cartan continuum . as sources of gravitational field in poincare gtg are covariant generalizations of energy - momentum and spin tensors .",
    "unlike gauge yang - mills fields , for which the lagrangian is quadratic in the gauge field strengths , gravitational lagrangian of poincare gtg can include also linear in curvature term ( scalar curvature ) , which is necessary to satisfy the correspondence principle with gr . by using sufficiently general expression for gravitational lagrangian",
    ", homogeneous isotropic gravitating models were investigated in the frame of poincare gtg in a number papers ( see for example [ 7 , 10 , 16 ] ) . because of high spatial symmetry gravitational equations depend weakly on the structure of quadratic part of gravitational lagrangian that permits to obtain conclusions of general character . below some important relations describing homogeneous isotropic models in poincare",
    "gtg will be given .",
    "spatial symmetries of riemann - cartan space are defined by a set of linearly independent killing s vectors , with respect to which the lie derivatives of metric and torsion tensors vanish ( see [ 1 ] chapter 2 , [ 17 ] ) .",
    "homogeneous isotropic models possess 6 linearly independent killing s vectors and metric tensor in co - moving system of reference has the form of robertson - walker metrics [ 17 ] : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the scale factor , @xmath2 for closed , flat , open models respectively ( the light velocity @xmath3 ) , spatial spherical coordinates are used .",
