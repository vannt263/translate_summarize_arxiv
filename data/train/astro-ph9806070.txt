    "the redshift determinations for grb970508 ( metzger et al . , 1997 ) and grb971214 ( kulkarni et al . , 1998 ) have demonstrated that grbs originate at cosmological distances and are therefore the most powerful photon sources in the universe , with peak luminosities exceeding 10@xmath3 erg / s , assuming isotropic emission .",

    "there are , however , a few marked cases where no x - ray or optical afterglow is seen , most notably grb970111 ( optical : castro - tirado et al . , 1997 ; gorosabel et al . , 1998 , x - rays , debated : feroci et al.,1998 ) , grb970828 ( optical : groot et al . , 1998a ) and grb980302 ( x - rays ) .",
    "in the last case , rxte / pca scanning , starting only 1.1 hours after the burst , found no x - ray afterglow at a level @xmath41 mcrab .",
    "one possible explanation for the lack of optical counterparts is the extinction by large column densities of gas and dust , obscuring the grb afterglows ( groot et al .",
    ", 1998a ; halpern et al . , 1998 ) .",
    "this might indicate an origin in star - forming regions where large quantities of gas and dust are present ( e.g. paczyski , 1998 ) .",
    "however , this scenario does not so readily explain the non - detection of an x - ray afterglow .",

    "time - of - arrival analysis between the ulysses spacecraft , bepposax and batse , allows the construction of an interplanetary network ( ipn ) annulus which intersects the bepposax wfc camera error box ( hurley et al . , 1998 ) .",

    "the event averaged spectrum has a shape typical of grbs ( photon index @xmath15 ) , but its @xmath16 , where the @xmath17 spectrum peaks , is unusually low : @xmath16=47@xmath18 kev .",
    "only 4% of the bursts in the sample of mallozzi et al . ( 1998 , over 1200 grbs ) have smaller @xmath16 values . however , mallozzi et al .",
    "have also shown that there is a correlation between grb intensity and spectral hardness ( expressed in @xmath16 values ) .",
    "for bursts with similar peak fluxes , the smallest @xmath16 value there is @xmath19 70 kev ( mallozzi , private communication ) , which demonstrates the exceptional softness of the integrated spectrum of grb980326 .",
    "optical cousins @xmath1-band observations started at the anglo - australian telescope ( aat ) on mar . 27.40 ut , followed by observations at the 3.5 m new technology telescope ( ntt ) and the 1.54 m danish telescope ( 1.5d ) at eso ( chile ) , the 4 m victor blanco telescope at ctio ( chile ) , the fred lawrence whipple 1.2 m ( flw 1.2 m ; usa ) telescope , the 1.5 m bologna university ( bo ; italy ) telescope and the 2.2 m calar - alto ( caha 2.2 m ; spain ) telescope ( see table 1 ) .",

    "table 2 shows the magnitude of the comparison stars in all photometric bands used .",
    "note that star 2 ( see fig .  [ fig : ipnfc ] ) was not detected in the @xmath20-band calibration frames .    from a comparison of the first observations at the aat and eso / ctio we discovered one clearly variable object ( groot et al . , 1998b ) .",

    "although the variability of sources at @xmath22 20 is very poorly known , we conclude that the optical transient is the counterpart to grb980326 , also considering the exhibited power law decay .",
    "figure  [ fig : light ] shows the @xmath1-band light curve of the optical transient .",
    "it exhibits a temporal decay which , as applied in previous bursts , can be fitted with a power law and a constant source : @xmath23 + c. the power law exponent , @xmath24 = 2.10@xmath00.13 , is by far higher than that of previous afterglows . the light curve exhibits a flattening , with a fitted constant source of @xmath25 ( @xmath26 for the fit is 10.2/9 ) , such as observed for grb970508 ( pedersen et al . , 1998 ;",
    "garcia et al . , 1998 ;",

    "visual inspection of the observations reported by djorgovski et al .",
    "( 1998 ) displays an elongation in exactly the perpendicular direction ( se - nw ) , which may be an effect of fading of the optical transient .",
    "this would mean that it is not in the center of an underlying galaxy .    on the night of mar .",
    "29.0 ut broadband @xmath27 measurements of the optical transient were made at the ntt ( @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) and at ctio ( @xmath20 ) . from the fit to the light curve presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : light ] we deduce an @xmath1-band value of 24.50 @xmath0 0.10 at mar 29.0 ut .",
    "the colours of the transient at this time were @xmath30 = 0.53@xmath00.34 , @xmath31 @xmath4 0.25 , @xmath32 ( 3@xmath33 limits on @xmath28 and @xmath29 ) .",
    "the @xmath30 value implies an , uncertain , spectral power law index , @xmath34 , of @xmath350.70 .",
    "one has to realise though , that the underlying source might contribute significantly to the colours , depending on the difference between the afterglow and constant source spectrum .",
    "afterglow observations of grbs over the last year show that a relativistic blast wave , in which the highly relativistic electrons radiate via the synchrotron mechanism , provides a generally good description of the observed properties ( wijers , rees and meszrs,1997 ; spn98 ) . here",
    "we will discuss briefly the implications of the power - law decay exponent @xmath24 and the optical spectral slope @xmath36 for a number of different blast wave models .",
    "for an extensive discussion on blast wave models and their application to grb afterglows we refer the reader to wijers , rees and meszrs ( 1997 ) , spn98 and galama et al .",
    "( 1998c ) .",
    "all models have that the flux @xmath37 for a range of frequencies and times which contain no spectral breaks . in each model or spectral state of a model @xmath24 and @xmath36 are functions only of @xmath38 , the power law exponent of the electron lorentz factor ( @xmath39 ) distribution , @xmath40 .",
    "the measurement of either one of @xmath24 or @xmath36 therefore fixes @xmath38 , and predicts the other one",
    ".    given the poor constraint on the spectral slope , we can not uniquely fit grb980326 , but we will examine whether its rapid decay requires special circumstances .",
    "first we assume that both the peak frequency @xmath41 and the cooling frequency @xmath42 ( see spn98 for their definitions ) have passed the optical passband at 0.5 days . in this case @xmath43 , and @xmath36=@xmath38/2 = 1.75 @xmath00.06 .",
    "the second possibility is when @xmath41 has already passed the optical at 0.5 days , but @xmath42 not yet at 4.2 days . in this state @xmath44 , and @xmath45 = 1.4 @xmath00.06 .",
    "although the latter case agrees slightly better with the measured @xmath30 spectral slope , we are hesistant to draw any conclusion from this , considering the uncertainty of the spectral slope . both , however , imply a much steeper electron spectrum for this burst than the value @xmath46 derived for grb970508 ( galama et al .",
    "1998c , d ) . in case",
    "the blast wave is jet - like , the inferred electron spectrum will only be different if the opening angle , @xmath47 , of the jet is less than the inverse of the opening angle , here @xmath48 , in which case for slowly cooling electrons @xmath49 , and for rapidly cooling electrons @xmath50 ( rhoads 1998 ) . in both cases",
    "@xmath51 , consistent with the optical colour .",
    "values of @xmath38 less than 2 are often considered implausible , because they imply a very efficient acceleration mechanism in which the most energetic electrons carry the bulk of the energy .",
    "what is the maximum value of @xmath38 that can be reached in shock acceleration ? in non - relativistic strong shocks it is generally accepted that @xmath522 ( bell , 1978 ; blandford and ostriker , 1978 ) . in ultra - relativistic shocks",
    "however , the situation is not so clear ( quenby and lieu , 1989 ) .",
    "recent calculations show that in this case @xmath38 will be between 3.2 and 3.8 , depending on the morphology of the magnetic field ( achterberg and gallant , 1998 ) .",
    "this is , however , when the electrons do not radiate an appreciable part of their energy during shock acceleration . if the electrons do radiate significantly , as is suggested grb970508 ( galama et al .",
    ", 1998c , d ; spn98 ) , the electron spectrum will steepen and the distribution of electrons will no longer be a pure power law . in a power - law model fit ,",
    "measured values exceeding @xmath53 are therefore expected and as a consequence , power law decays of afterglows that are even more rapid than the @xmath24=2.10 found here are entirely possible .",
    "the optical behaviour of bursts like grb970828 ( groot et al . , 1998a ) and grb971214 ( halpern et al . ,",
    "1998 ) can be explained by extinction due to gas and dust between the observer and the origin of the grb source . however extinction will fail to explain the non - existence of an x - ray afterglow above 45 kev since at these energies extinction is negligible .",
    "the fact that all bepposax nfi follow - ups have detected an x - ray afterglow ( with the possible exception of grb970111 , feroci et al . , 1998 ) and that only two rxte / pca scannings ( for grb970616 and grb970828 ) have produced x - ray afterglows , makes the question arise what the cause of this difference is .",
    "suppose we have an x - ray afterglow that decays as a power law with exponent @xmath24 .",
    "what is the x - ray afterglow flux needed shortly ( @xmath19 1 minute ) after the burst , as a function of @xmath24 , if we want to detect the afterglow at a level of @xmath19 1mcrab after a few hours ?",
    "the x - ray flux after 1 minute can be estimated by the x - ray emission detected in the burst itself , since this x - ray emission will be a mixture of the x - ray tail of the grb and the start of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "we can therefore derive an estimate of the upper limit to the x - ray afterglow level after a few hours from the prompt x - ray emission .",
    "figure  [ fig : fx1 m ] shows the flux needed after 1 minute for a detection after 1 , 2 and 5 hours at a level of 1 mcrab as a function of decay rate @xmath24 . for bursts that have detected x - ray or optical afterglows",
    "we have also plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : fx1 m ] the observed total x - ray fluxes during the bursts versus the x - ray power law decay index @xmath24 .",
    "( for grb980326 we used the optical @xmath24 , since no x - ray afterglow decay index is known . ) because of the mixture explained above these points actually comprise a set of upper - limits for the flux in the x - ray afterglow after one minute .",
    "it is not only clear from fig .",
    "[ fig : fx1 m ] that most of the bursts that have been found to exhibit an x - ray afterglow would have been missed by an rxte / pca scan after 25 hours , but also that this is particularly the case for bursts with high values of @xmath24 .",
    "a rapid decay is therefore a viable explanation for the non - detection of bursts , even as bright as grb980203 , by the current rxte / pca follow - up .",
    "it has to be noted that the scanning of the rxte / pca is often performed over no more than the 1.52@xmath33 batse errorboxes , and there exists therefore a 514% chance of not scanning the grb .    for bursts that show neither x - ray nor optical afterglows",
    ", a different explanation may be found in the fact that all five detected optical afterglows are associated with galaxies . in the merging neutron - star scenario ,",
    "a substantial fraction of bursts would occur in a galactic halo , where the average density of the interstellar medium is @xmath191000 times less than in a disk . since the afterglow peak flux , @xmath54 , depends on the square root of the density of the ambient medium",
    ", this would mean a reduction of the afterglow peak flux by several magnitudes with respect to bursts that go off in higher density regions ( mszros and rees , 1997 ) . since grbs are detected by their prompt @xmath2-ray emission , probably produced by internal shocks ( mszros and rees , 1997 )",
    ", this would be independent of the density of the ambient medium .",
    "we have detected the optical counterpart to grb980326 .",
    "its temporal decay is well represented by a power law with index 2.10 , faster than for any previously found grb afterglow , and a constant contribution at @xmath1 = 25.5@xmath0 0.5 , which is most likely caused by an underlying galaxy .",
    "fireball models can give an adequate description of this rapid power law decay of grb980326 , although its limited optical spectral information makes it hard to distinguish between different models .",
    "this emphasizes the need for multi - colour photometry , even when the optical counterpart has not yet been found .",
    "a rapid temporal decay may be a reason for the non - detection of low - energy afterglows of bursts that had x - ray and optical follow - ups .",
    "the occurrence of grbs in galactic halos , in the merging neutron star scenario , may be an alternative explanation for the non - detection of low - energy afterglows . to establish the viability of these explanations for the non - detection of low - energy afterglows ,",
    "it is of vital importance that more grb afterglows are found and this is only possible when low - energy follow - up begins as soon as possible ( @xmath551hr ) after the initial grb event .",
