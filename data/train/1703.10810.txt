    "a sketch of the experimental setup is shown in fig . [ fig : optics ] . a laser beam generated by a solid state laser ( laser quantum `` gem532 '' , 532 nm , 2  w maximum power ) passes through a beam splitter ( bs ) to form two optical traps at different heights , which we named the `` upper '' and `` lower '' trap .",
    "the transmitted beam that is collinear to the incident beam is used to form the `` lower '' trap .",

    "the combined trapping power from the two beams is approximately 350  mw . in a similar manner ,",
    "the reflected beam from bs is used to create the `` upper '' trap , which is positioned approximately 2  mm above the lower trap .",
    "two half wave plates ( hw1 and hw2 ) and the polarizing beam splitters ensure that the counter propagating beams have orthogonal polarization states , thus eliminating undesirable interference at the focal points .",
    "two electro - optical amplitude modulators ( eom1 and eom2 ) and two polarizers ( p1 and p2 ) allow us to control the timing of the release of the droplets .",
    "the region where the droplets interact is illuminated by two collimated cold white light led ( thorlabs mcwhl5 ) operated at 10% of the maximum power .",

    "the cartridge works as a drop - on - demand system , where a droplet is ejected each time a ttl pulse is sent to the cartridge from a pulse generator ( see @xcite and @xcite and references within for the droplet generation technique ) .",
    "the cartridge , washed and filled with a solution mixed with 90% ( by volume ) of distilled water and 10% of glycerol ( produced by fisher scientific with a purity of 99.6% ) , produces droplets with a uniform diameter of approximately .",
    "the water evaporates rapidly as the droplet descends down towards the trap .",
    "hence , the size of the trapped droplet can be controlled by changing the mixing ratio of glycerol solution . as an example , a solution containing 5% of glycerol in water yields droplets of approximately in diameter after the water has completely evaporated away .",
    "alternatively , the droplet can be made larger by allowing two drops to coalesce in the trap .",
    "the size of the largest droplet that can be levitated is determined by the laser beam waist and the available laser power . for the results presented in this work ,",
    "the droplet size distribution is in the range from 29.9 to in diameter .",

    "the cartridge and micro - lenses are mounted in an enclosed chamber .",
    "the chamber is made out of metal and cover glass plates connected by flexible construction sealant ( sikaflex 291i ) .",
    "the flexible connection allows the movement of the micro - lenses to be decoupled from the metal plates of the chamber .",
    "hence , the position of the optical traps can be independently adjusted without breaking the seal .",
    "droplets descend from the cartridge through a flexible polymer tubing and enter the chamber through a glass cylindrical tube ( 2.5  cm in diameter ) placed above the chamber .",
    "droplets ejected from the cartridge travel a few centimeters before reaching their terminal velocity and descend vertically down the tube to the trapping points .",
    "the chamber has four windows on the sides for illumination and optical access and one on top for visual control and physical access .",
    "the volume of the chamber is approximately @xmath44 .      in order to produce a collision ,",
    "the two droplets are released from the same horizontal position but at different vertical positions . as a coarse adjustment",
    "the separation of the traps is adjusted by moving the lenses for the optical traps ( mo1/mo2 or mo3/mo4 ) in pair .",
    "fine adjustment in the separation of the traps is accomplished by distributing the input power in one of the counter - propagating beams for the optical trap asymmetrically .",
    "this is done with a slight rotation of the half wave plate hw1 or hw2 that is placed before the beam enters the polarizing beam splitters pbs1 or pbs2 ( fig .",

    "shadow images of the droplets are obtained by projecting incoherent collimated light from two leds ( thorlabs mcwhl5 ) onto the sensors of the cameras ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "this arrangement not only offers a simple approach in the alignment of the two droplets , but also allows a precise determination of the droplet positions and impact parameters .",

    "in the present study we have implemented an optical trapping technique to measure the collision trajectories of free - falling droplets .",
    "we discuss in the following a number of points that require further considerations .",
    "in addition to thermal fluctuations in the surrounding air , two major sources of heat are present in the experiment .",
    "first , thermal inkjet technology uses heat , as opposed to mechanical pressure , to force the liquid out of the print head nozzle .",
    "second , although the absorption coefficient of glycerol is small , the focusing effect due to the spherical shape of the droplet invariably heats up the droplets and the air around it .",
    "this may have three implications .",
    "first , the droplets evaporate and decrease in size .",
    "we have measured the evaporation rate of trapped droplet .",
    "after the droplet has reached an equilibrium in the trap , the droplet size would have to reduce by as much as in diameter in order to produce a detectable change in the image .",
    "this process happens across a time scale of approximately 10  minutes .",
    "we found that the droplet evaporates according to the @xmath79-law @xcite , that is the radius decreases in time following the relation @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the droplet radius at a given time @xmath82 , @xmath83 is the initial droplet radius and @xmath84 is the evaporation coefficient . on the other hand ,",
    "the time scale during which the droplets interact is of the order of 10  ms , which is approximately 10000 times smaller than the time scale of evaporation .",
    "we therefore conclude that the effect of evaporation is negligible in the collision process .",
    "second , the temperature gradient between the droplet and the surrounding air may give rise to convective air flow and so it raised the question `` how much do the droplet trajectories deviate from those derived purely based on isothermal hydrodynamic considerations ? '' .",
    "we did notice that small droplets ( @xmath85 ) occasionally move upwards when released from the trap whereas large droplets ( @xmath86 ) consistently fall in the same direction as gravity without any apparent convective motion .",
    "the droplets reported in this work are typically in the size range of @xmath87 , so we believe convective motion should be negligible .",
    "third , the glycerol droplet surface tension diminishes linearly with increasing temperature , albeit very weakly @xcite .",
    "the surface tension decreases by 7.6% from a value of @xmath88  nm@xmath23 at to @xmath89  nm@xmath23 at .",
    "since the optical quality of the upper and lower traps are nearly identical , the droplets should be in nearly the same thermodynamic state upon contact , so that the coalescence mechanism is purely governed by hydrodynamical processes , and that there is no formation of thermal shock waves .",
    "the thermal conditions of the droplet environment is certainly one aspect we can control and improve in subsequent experiments .",
    "we precisely control the volumetric mixing ratio of the water and glycerol solution in each experiment . however , the chemical and aerosol content of the room air is not monitored . for the individual experiments presented here , we have taken precautionary steps to reduce the probability of contamination by shielding the levitation chamber from its external environment , as described in section [ subsec : chamber ] , and isolating the chamber from the room air for up to a day so that undesirable contaminants may settle out of the observation volume .",
    "our current effort is to eliminate this uncertainty by filtering the air in a recirculation loop .",
    "perhaps the largest uncertainty in connection with the hydrodynamics of the collision process is the state of the electrostatic charge on the droplets in our experiments .",
    "earlier experiments utilizing nozzle - based droplet generation technique have noted accumulation of charges on the droplets upon ejection from the nozzle orifice @xcite . while the presence of electrical charge may be an undesirable aspect in a hydrodynamic experiment , the dynamics of charged droplets is of particular relevance to the atmosphere @xcite and protoplanetary nebula @xcite . in the context of our experiment , which concerns the collision process of binary droplets in a gravitational field ,",
    "the presence of charge may add complexity but is not at all unfavorable .",
    "possible diagnostic measures to determine the amount of electrical charge on individual droplets include applying a dc or ac electric field across the droplet and measuring the displacement from its equilibrium position @xcite .      upon initiation of the coalescence process",
    ", mixing occurs internally inside the newly formed droplet .",
    "the characteristic time scale of the mixing process can be estimated using dimensional analysis @xcite .",
    "due to size dissimilarity , the capillary pressure within the small droplet exceeds that within the large droplet by an order of magnitude of @xmath90 .",
    "this small pressure difference drives the small droplet into the large droplet and disperses the liquid inside the newly formed droplet .",
    "this is a fair assumption because large scale motion is most effective at transporting momentum .",
    "the characteristic velocity of the large scale motion , @xmath91 , can be obtained from the dimensional relation @xmath92 .",
    "this motion occurs at a time scale given by @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the diameter of the newly formed droplet . for a droplet as discussed in section [ subsec : gravitationalcoalescence ] ,",
    "the corresponding time scale is approximately .",
    "such a motion is within the resolution limit of our imaging system and is an interesting topic for further research .",
