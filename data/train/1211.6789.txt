    "it is well known that real thermal engines can not achieve a perfect carnot cycle . in a perfect carnot cycle , the two reversible isothermal stages must be infinitely long and hence the carnot engine has zero power output .",
    "although the carnot thermal machine is impractical , it gives an upper limit on the efficiency of all thermal engines .",
    "real thermal engines work at finite cycle times and lose a finite amount of energy due to irreversible cycles and other mechanisms such as mechanical friction , heat leak and dissipative processes , etc .",
    "searching for real thermal engines which operate with optimal cycles has caught a lot of attention . here",
    "`` optimal '' refers to different optimizations of the heat engine , such as maximum efficiency , maximum power , maximum entropy production @xcite and maximum work@xcite , etc .",
    "of all these optimizations , the efficiency of thermal engines at maximum output power is a very practical problem and has been extensively studied in the literature @xcite .",
    "the efficiency of a quantum thermal engine operating at maximum power has also recently been studied @xcite .",
    "one of the most important results addressing the efficiency of a thermal engine at maximum power was given by curzon and ahlborn in 1975@xcite .",
    "here we briefly review their result first .",
    "they made the assumption that during the time that the working medium is in contact with the hot(cold ) reservoir , the amount of heat exchanged is proportional to the temperature difference between the working medium and the reservoirs , and also to the time duration of the processes . during the heating process , which lasts time @xmath0 , the amount of heat @xmath1 absorbed by the system is @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the temperature of the heat source , @xmath4 the temperature of the working medium and @xmath5 the heat transfer coefficient of the heating process .",
    "similarly , for the cooling process which lasts time @xmath6 , the working medium releases heat @xmath7 @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the temperature of the cold source , @xmath10 the temperature of the working substance and @xmath11 the heat transfer coefficient of the cooling process .",
    "the reversibility of the adiabatic stages requires @xmath12 this leads to a relationship between @xmath13 and @xmath14 . by maximizing the power output of the system",
    ", they derived the famous curzon - ahlborn ( ca ) formula for the efficiency of the thermal engines at maximum power as : @xmath15 the ca formula describes the thermal engines of power plants very well @xcite and all the parameters here have clear physical meanings .",
    "however , as pointed out by ref .",
    "@xcite , the ca formula is neither exact nor universal , and it gives neither an upper bound nor a lower bound .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors considered a carnot thermal engine performing finite - time cycles .",
    "they assume that the amount of heat absorbed by the system per cycle from the hot(cold ) reservoir is given by @xmath16 and @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the temperature of the hot(cold ) reservoir and @xmath19 the time during which the thermal machine is in contact with the hot(cold ) reservoir .",
    "the second terms of eqs.([eq.1 ] ) and ( [ eq.2 ] ) give the extra entropy production per cycle when the system deviates from the reversible regime . by maximizing the power ,",
    "the efficiency of the engine can be derived .",
    "the upper and lower bounds of the thermal efficiency at maximum power are derived when the ratio @xmath20 approaches 0 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "esposito et al s result agrees well with the observed efficiencies of thermal plants@xcite . however , why the working medium releases less heat for longer contact times with the cold reservoir as indicated by eq.([eq.2 ] ) was not explained .",
    "also , in both ref.@xcite and @xcite , only carnot engines were studied .    in this paper",
    ", we study a more general and realistic thermal engine model and derive its efficiency bounds at maximum power . in both ref.@xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the temperature of the working medium does not change during heat transferring processes which is not true for either a realistic system , such as thermal plants , or for other heat engine models , such as the otto , joule - brayton , diesel , and akinson engines@xcite .",
    "instead , we simply assume that heat transfer by a thermal engine is described by newton s law of cooling , thus it does not have to be isothermal anymore .",
    "furthermore , we also take into account the fact that the thermal capacities of the working medium in realistic systems usually could be quite different at high and low temperatures@xcite .",
    "this is also be motivated by heat engines , such as the diesel and akinson type , for which the thermal capacities are different at the two different thermal stages@xcite .    with these two modifications",
    ", we argue that our model is not only more realistic , but also more general .",
    "since the efficiency and its bounds are derived by considering heat exchange processes during which the temperature of the working medium could be close to or far away from isothermal , our model could simulate heat transferring not only in carnot engines , as in ref.@xcite and @xcite , but also some other engines such as otto , joule - brayton , diesel , and akinson as described in ref.@xcite .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows , we will first describe newton s law of cooling and derive the corresponding entropy and heat formulas , and then study the thermal efficiency at maximum power for two limiting cases .",
    "we assume heat transferred by thermal engines in contact with a heat source is described by newton s law of cooling : @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the heat capacity , @xmath24 medium mass , @xmath25 medium temperature , @xmath26 heat source temperature , @xmath27 heat transfer coefficient , and @xmath28 contact area . for convenience ,",
    "we denote @xmath29 by @xmath30 .",
    "though newton s law of cooling is quite simple , many other heat transfer laws can be simplified to it if the temperatures of the objects are high while the temperature difference between them is small .",
    "based on this assumption , we consider a thermal engine working between hot and cold reservoirs at temperatures @xmath31 and @xmath32 respectively , and the initial temperature of the working medium is @xmath33(@xmath34 ) at the beginning of the heating(cooling ) stage . the solution to eq.([eq.3 ] ) gives the temperature of the working medium at time @xmath35 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 .",
    "assuming that the time during which the working medium is in contact with the high temperature source is @xmath38 , the entropy produced during the heating process can be evaluated straightforwardly as : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "the heat exchanged between the working medium and the high temperature source is given by @xmath41 here and from now on we take the convention that @xmath42 means absorbing and @xmath43 releasing heat .",
    "similarly , the entropy production and heat exchange of the working medium during the cooling process are given by @xmath44 where @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "after a thermodynamic cycle , the system returns to its initial state , and the total entropy change of the working medium should be zero @xmath47 @xcite , which leads to @xmath48}=0.\\ ] ] by noting that @xmath49 , @xmath50 and by defining @xmath51 , eq.([eq.4 ] ) is reduced to @xmath52 the power output and the efficiency of the thermal engine are given by @xmath53 generally , the efficiency @xmath54 at maximum power output can be derived using the constraint of eq.([eq.18 ] ) .",
    "however , eq.([eq.18 ] ) is a transcendental equation which can not be solved analytically . in what follows we will focus our discussions on two special cases",
    "in this case , the contact time is long enough that the working medium can exchange heat sufficiently with the reservoirs .",
    "therefore the final temperature of the working medium is close to the heat reservoir and quite different from its initial temperature .",
    "numerically , when @xmath56 , we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 .",
    "thus , when @xmath59 is sufficiently large , which is supposed to be the case studied in ref.@xcite , @xmath60 can be safely ignored , and eq.([eq.18 ] ) is reduced to @xmath61 by plugging eq.([eq.17 ] ) into eq.([eq.10 ] ) and ( [ eq.12 ] ) , using eq.([eq.19])then the output power is given by @xmath62}{\\tau_{h}+\\tau_{c}}.\\ ] ] let @xmath63 , @xmath64 is maximized when @xmath65.\\ ] ] therefore , the efficiency at maximum power is given by @xmath66=1-\\frac{1}{\\gamma}[\\frac{\\eta_{c}}{1-(1-\\eta_{c})^{\\frac{1}{1+\\gamma}}}-1].\\ ] ] from the above expression we see that @xmath54 decreases as @xmath67 increases . for the symmetric dissipation in which @xmath68 , @xmath54 becomes @xmath69 interestingly , the ca efficiency is recovered though the situation is quite different .",
    "expanding @xmath54 in series of @xmath70 , we have @xmath71 the coefficient of the second order term lies between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , while in ref.@xcite this term is between @xmath74 and @xmath75 which indicates a tighter bound here .",
    "the lower and upper bounds of @xmath54 in this case are given by @xmath76 a comparison of the upper and lower bounds for the long contact time limit between this work and results derived in ref.@xcite is shown as fig.[fig.scattering ] .",
    "we see that the limits derived here give much tighter bounds than those derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "we emphasize again that our model does not only apply to carnot engines . since the final temperature of the working medium after heat exchange can be quite different from its initial temperature , it is not necessarily an isothermal process and thus the engine does not need to be a carnot type engine .",
    "it can also simulate the engines described in ref.@xcite , if we take @xmath77 , it is the otto engine , @xmath78 , the joule - brayton engine , @xmath79 , the diesel engine and @xmath80 , the akinson engine .",
    "we can recover all the thermal efficiencies at maximum power derived in ref.@xcite .",
    "correspondingly , the bounds derived in this section should apply to those four types of engines mentioned above in practical conditions .      in this case , the heating and cooling processes are both short .",
    "therefore the final temperature of the working medium after transferring heat is very close to its initial temperature .",
    "this is approximately what was studied in ref.@xcite where temperature of the working medium does not change during heat transfers .",
    "numerically , one can estimate that if @xmath82 , then @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "we solve eq.([eq.18 ] ) by expanding it as series of the infinitesimal variable ( @xmath59 ) and matching both sides of the equation order by order ( we always keep the same order of @xmath85 and @xmath86 ) .",
    "as @xmath81 , to the zeroth order of @xmath59 , eq.([eq.18 ] ) simply gives @xmath87 which is trivial . to the first order of @xmath59 , eq.([eq.18 ] ) gives @xmath88 now the amounts of heat exchanged by the system during the heating and cooling processes are given by @xmath89 the above equations agree with the fundamental equations listed at the beginning of ref .",
    "thus if we continue our straightforward calculation , we simply recover the same results in ref .",
    "@xcite , including the ca efficiency .",
    "now , we continue to expand eq.([eq.18 ] ) to the second order of @xmath59 , we obtain another simple relation @xmath90 combining this with eq.([eq.20 ] ) , we get @xmath91 to obatian the expression for the power output @xmath64 , plug eqs.([eq.23 ] ) and ( [ eq.24 ] ) into eq.([eq.19 ] ) , and expand the expressions of @xmath92 and @xmath93 to the first order of @xmath59 again , we have @xmath94 @xmath64 is maximized by letting @xmath63 .",
    "note @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the unique allowed solution of @xmath97 is given by @xmath98t_{h}}{\\frac{\\gamma\\sigma_{c}-\\sigma_{h}}{\\sigma_{h}+\\sigma_{c}}}.\\ ] ] therefore the thermal efficiency at maximum power is given by @xmath99        by defining @xmath100 , and using the relation @xmath101 , @xmath54 can be expressed as    @xmath102(\\beta+\\gamma)}-\\sqrt{[1+\\gamma(1-\\eta_{c})](1+\\gamma)}}{\\beta\\sqrt{[1+\\gamma(1-\\eta_{c})](1+\\gamma)}-\\sqrt{[\\beta+\\gamma(1-\\eta_{c})](\\beta+\\gamma)}}.\\ ] ]    @xmath103    moreover , @xmath54 can be expanded in a series of @xmath104 as @xmath105 the coefficient of the first order term of @xmath54 is @xmath106 , and the coefficient of the second order term lies in the range between @xmath74 and @xmath75 . in the symmetric case",
    "where @xmath107 and @xmath68 , we have @xmath108 when expanding as a series in @xmath104 , the coefficient of the second order term is @xmath109 .",
    "those results agree with the expansion of ca efficiency @xcite . to the third order of @xmath70 ,",
    "the difference of @xmath54 from @xmath110 is @xmath111 . a comparison between @xmath112 and the ca efficiency and our result for the symmetric case is shown in fig.[fig.1 ] .",
    "now , we estimate the bounds of @xmath54 . in the limits",
    "@xmath113 or @xmath114 while @xmath115 is finite , we recover the lower and upper limits of @xmath54 given in ref .",
    "@xmath116 interestingly our bounds on @xmath112 are obtained in the short contact time limit ( @xmath117 ) while the same results were obtained in the long contact time limit ( @xmath118 ) in ref .",
    "it is easy to verify that @xmath54 decreases as @xmath67 increases , but increases as @xmath115 increases .",
    "this means the larger the ratio between heat capacities of the working medium at the hot and cold reservoirs , the lower the efficiency at maximum output power .",
    "in summary , we presented an analysis of thermal efficiency and its bounds at maximum power for thermal engines for which the heat transferring processes are described by newton s law of cooling . in the long contact time limit , ca efficiency is recovered for symmetric thermal capacity and two tighter bounds on the thermal efficiency are derived .",
    "the model can simulate otto , joule brayton , diesel and atkinson engines in the long contact time limit . in the short contact time limit",
    ", we recover the famous ca efficiency in the first order calculation .",
    "when we proceed to the second order calculation , we derived a different efficiency formula and recovered the efficiency bounds at maximum power given by espositi , et al . in both limits ,",
    "the thermal efficiency is found to decrease as @xmath119 increases.this might be helpful for choosing a suitable working medium and working temperatures when designing a thermal engine whose heat transfer can be approximated by newton s law of cooling .",
    "other cases such as those associated with intermediate thermal contact time and different heat transfer laws are being investigated further .",
