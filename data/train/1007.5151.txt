    "and we observe a value of 2.3 ev close to the estimated value .",
    "the peaks in the kinetic energy distribution shift towards higher values with marginal increase in the width .",
    "this indicates that the excess energy is channelled into translational energy of the and fragments with little energy going into the excitation of higher vibrational modes .",
    "internal excitation of the sh fragment in the form of vibrations and rotations results in broadening of the width of the distribution .",
    "we tried to determine the relative intensities of the sh vibrational states by fitting with gaussian functions ( same width , different height ) - as mentioned in the previous chapter for water - representing the spread of kinetic energy at positions separated by the vibrational spacing i.e. 2615 @xmath9 or 0.34 ev @xcite .",

    "similar exercise in the case of 6.5 ev resonance in water shows vibrational states populated up to v=4 and the relative intensities are 1:0.82:0.57:0.32:0.25 .",
    "this shows that most of the excess energy is converted into translational energy rather than internal excitation of the fragments in the case of . at 6 ev ,",
    "the ke distribution is broader and suggests significant population of @xmath4=1 and @xmath4=2 levels .",
    "the angular distribution of @xmath10 ions is shown in figure [ fig4.4](c ) and we see a distribution peaking close to @xmath11 with a slight asymmetry about the peak .",
    "the distribution is very similar to that reported by azria et al .",
    "@xcite as shown in the figure [ fig4.4](c ) .",
    "this distribution indicates symmetry of the anion caused by the excitation.this distribution indicates symmetry of the anion caused by the excitation .",
    "fitting the angular distribution using symmetry functions shows @xmath12 and @xmath13 partial waves involved in the scattering process .",
    "the asymmetry about the @xmath14 direction is due to mixing of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 wave with a phase difference of @xmath15 radians as can be seen from the fit in figure [ fig4.4](c ) .",
    "these observations and fits are identical to the 6.5 ev resonance in water .",

    "therefore , the parent state of the dea resonance at 5.2 ev is arising from the excitation consistent with the kinetic energy and angular distributions and symmetry rules .",
    "azria et al .",
    "@xcite reported that at a higher electron energy ( at 5.97 ev ) , the angular distribution of ions corresponding to the @xmath4=0 and @xmath4=1 states of the sh fragment are different .",
    "this is not seen for ions from .",
    "haxton et al .",
    "@xcite showed in their calculations that taking different entrance amplitude for each vibration state of sh could lead to difference in the angular distribution of ions . to verify this",
    ", we looked at the angular distributions of ions at 5.2 ev and 6.0 ev as a function of the kinetic energy ( see figure [ fig4.5 ] ) . at 6.0 ev , forward scattering angles",
    "are more intense than at 5.2 ev and we see that the angular distributions are same for the ions with ke above 2.5 ev ( corresponding to ) and for 2 - 2.5 ev ( for ) .",
    "our kinetic energy resolution is not sufficient to clearly separate the @xmath16 and @xmath17 states of sh and hence , can not conclusively confirm angular distribution of ions being different for the two vibrational states . while , it may be noted that the forward scattering of the ions is seen at the 7.5 ev resonance , azria et al .",
    "@xcite have ruled out the contribution from the tail of the second process stating that the ions from the resonance are mostly associated with sh fragment in @xmath16 state .",
    "however , in our measurements , as seen from the plots in figure [ fig4.5](b ) , the contribution from the 7.5 ev resonance seems to cause the enhanced forward scattering of at all kinetic energies .",
    "figure [ fig4.3](d ) shows the velocity image of / ( unresolved ) ions produced at this resonance .",
    "the higher resolution measurements of the mass spectrum and ion yield curves by abouaf and teillet - billy @xcite found no ions at this resonance . although the presence of @xmath18 + h channel is energetically possible , it is ruled out based on wigner - witmer correlation rules , for a resonance of symmetry .",
    "figure [ fig4.3](d ) show some anisotropic distribution of the ions scattered perpendicular to the electron beam indicating that these might be ions ejected via the + channel .",
    "we see that the image shows a left - right asymmetry due to imaging distortion .",
    "however , the perpendicular scattering is discernible .",
    "this is on expected lines from a resonance of symmetry where the molecular plane is perpendicular to electron beam .",
    "thus , ejected in the molecular plane will appear perpendicular with respect to the electron beam .",
    "the simplest mechanism for the formation of is through the three - body fragmentation channel involving breaking of the two s - h bonds .",
    "however , the threshold energy for this process is 5.4 ev .",
    "we see that is formed at lower energies .",
    "this can happen only if the two h atoms form a new bond between them forming while breaking away from the s atom .",
    "the threshold for the + channel is 1.06 ev and for incident electron energies of 5 ev and 6 ev , the maximum kinetic energy of estimated is 2/34th of the excess energy i.e. 0.23 ev and 0.29 ev , respectively .",
    "the ke distribution of at 5.5 ( figure [ fig4.6 ] ) shows maximum ke of about 0.25 ev with a peak close to 0.1 ev .",
    "the peak energy of 0.1 ev corresponds to 2.7 ev of energy in the internal excitation of .",
    "this suggests that the formation of is coupled with the production of in highly vibrational excited states .",
    "the population of high vibrational levels in is only to be expected since the internuclear separation between the two h atoms are likely to be much larger than that corresponding to @xmath4=0 state during its formation .",
    "we also infer the presence of the three body breakup channel ( threshold : 5.4 ev ) from the finite intensity at kinetic energies close to zero ( approx .",
    "0.03 ev ) .",
    "ions at 5.5 ev ]        the third resonance at 7.5 ev produces ions dominantly as seen in ion yield curve in figure [ fig4.1 ] .",
    "the maximum kinetic energy of ions observed at this resonance is about 4 ev as seen in figure [ fig4.7](a ) .",
    "this indicates the dissociation channel to be + sh ( x @xmath1 ) whose thermodynamic threshold is 3.15 ev . the maximum kinetic energy for this channel would be 4.3 ev which is close to our observed value of 4 ev .",
    "the kinetic energy distribution measured by azria et al .",
    "@xcite at 7.5 ev in @xmath19 degree direction showed sh fragments to be in @xmath4=0 state only .",
    "the kinetic energy distribution obtained in the present measurement given in figure [ fig4.7](a ) is obtained by integrating over the entire @xmath20 scattering range . retrieving the sh vibrational state population by fitting gaussian functions to the kinetic energy distribution for electron energy of 7.5 ev revealed sh",
    "states upto @xmath4=4 being populated ( see figure [ fig4.7](b ) ) .",
    "the relative intensities of the vibrational levels are found to be in the ratio 1:0.31:0.22:0.17:0.07 .",
    "the angular distribution plot for ions of all kinetic energies is given in figure [ fig4.7](c ) along with the data of azria et al @xcite .",
    "both the measurements show perfect agreement .",
    "the anion symmetry state is as seen by the fits in figure [ fig4.7](c ) using symmetry functions involving @xmath21 and @xmath22 partial waves .",
    "the relative amplitudes of the partial waves in the fits are found to be 1:0.85 with @xmath23=1.19 ( for @xmath21 ) and 1:0.3:1.5 with @xmath24 ( phase difference between @xmath25 and @xmath12 wave ) and @xmath26 ( phase difference between @xmath12 and @xmath13 wave ) close to zero ( for @xmath22 ) .",
    "further , we also looked for the variation of the angular distribution as a function of the kinetic energy ( or internal excitation of sh fragment . ) the angular plots as a function of ke are plotted in figure [ fig4.8 ] for the incident electron energies 6.8 ev , 7.5 ev and 8.2 ev respectively .",
    "we see that the angular distributions show similar curves with peaks at @xmath19 and @xmath27 over the entire kinetic energy range .",
    "unlike the angular distribution of ions from the resonance at 8.5 ev in water , where the angular distribution varies as a function of the vibrational state of oh , there is no such behaviour in .",
    "thus , axial recoil approximation is found to hold good in the case of consistent with symmetry in the entire fragmentation process at this resonance .",
    "that is , the molecular ion does not undergo any structural change like bending mode vibration during the dissociation process .",
    "whereas in , the bending mode vibration of the molecule makes it linear leading to variation in the angular distribution of ions with kinetic energy .",
    "thus , we see intra - molecular vibrational redistribution ( ivr ) of excess energy into the bending mode oscillations to be dominant prior to the dissociation of the water anion whereas in there appear to be very little ivr",
    ".      figures [ fig4.3 ] ( e ) and ( f ) show the velocity image of / as a very small blob without any anisotropic structure and is attributed to the three body break up process + h + h ( threshold : 5.4 ev ) . the maximum",
    "ke estimated is about 0.12 ev .",
    "energetically , produced via the ( @xmath3 ) + h ( threshold : 1.6 ev ) is also possible . at 7.5 ev ,",
    "the excess energy available for this channel is 5.9 ev ( more than the three body breakup threshold ) . assuming that this excess energy is distributed as kinetic energy amongst the and h fragments",
    ", the maximum ke of would be about 0.18 ev .",
    "however , it is unlikely to be as there is sufficient energy available for three body break up and high resolution measurements by abouaf and billy @xcite show only at higher electron energies .",
    "no ion signal was seen in their measurements at electron energies beyond 4 ev .",
    "also , the size of the velocity image is not commensurate with maximum ke expected from the ( @xmath3 ) channel .",
    "this is similar to the case in , where the three body + h + h ( threshold 8.04 ev ) channel is seen at the 8.5 ev resonance ( state ) but no is seen .",
    "thus , the puzzle of absence of ( @xmath28 ) , even though favoured by an resonance state seems to extend to as well where the ( @xmath28 ) appears to be absent at the resonance about 7.5 ev .",
    "there has been no report so far on the resonance at around 10 ev , though its existence has been seen in total ion yield measurements .",
    "photo - electron / photo - absorption studies show the lowest excited states of as of , and symmetry in ascending order @xcite .",
    "the first two are supposedly the grandparent states of the anion resonances at 5.2 and 7.4 ev respectively .",
    "hence , the resonance at 9.6 ev may be understood as two rydberg electrons attached to the state of .      a comparison of the resonances in and",
    "indicate that the dea process in centered at 9.6 ev is similar to the 11.8 ev resonance in .",
    "the at this resonance produces ions scattered in forward and backward angles in three groups ( inner , middle and outer ) as shown in the velocity map images ( see figure [ fig4.2]-(g),(h),(i ) ) .",
    "the kinetic energy distribution of ions for electron energies 9.0 ev , 9.6 ev and 10.4 ev plotted in figure [ fig4.9](a ) .",
    "the plot for 9.0 ev shows clearly three structures - first between 0 and 1.5 ev , second between 1.5 ev and 3 ev and the third one beyond 3 ev .",
    "while the outer structure beyond 3 ev is seen clearly at 9 ev , it becomes weaker as the electron energy increases .",
    "i.e. at 9.6 ev and 10.4 ev .",
    "the structure in the kinetic energy spectrum beyond 3 ev is attributed to the + sh ( @xmath29 ) channel with threshold energy of 3.15 ev . at incident electron energy of 9.6 ev",
    ", the maximum kinetic energy of is estimated to be about 6.5 ev .",
    "however , we do not observe ions with energy more than 4 ev indicating that sh is being formed in very high vibrational states , close to its dissociation limit .",
    "the structure between 1.5 and 3 ev with a peak at 2 ev points to dissociation channel where the neutral sh fragment is in the first electronic excited state .",
    "the peak in the kinetic energy spectrum shows that this is the dominant fragmentation channel of the resonance .",
    "this may appear a trifle surprising since the threshold for this channel at 6.9 ev is higher than the threshold ( 6.74 ev ) for three - body fragmentation channel . however , we note that the dissociation limit for ( a @xmath30 ) is ( ) + h , which is 1.15 ev above s ( ) + h @xcite . using the threshold energy",
    "( 6.9 ev ) and the dissociation limit into + h + s ( ) ( 7.89 ev ) , the kinetic energy of would be in the range of 1.7 to 2.62 ev taking incident electron energy to be 9.6 ev .",
    "this appears to be in reasonable agreement with our observation .",
    "the structure between 0 to 1.5 ev indicates the three body breakup channel + h + s. this process has threshold energy of 6.74 ev . for the instantaneous symmetric three body breakup of the resonant state ,",
    "the kinetic energies of and ions as a function of half the bond angle h - s - h ( @xmath31 ) are given by    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the total kinetic energy release .",
    "at the electron energy of 9.6 ev , @xmath33 is 2.86 ev for the channel and 4.2 ev for the channel . under axial recoil approximation ,",
    "i.e. , for the equilibrium bond angle of @xmath6 , will have a kinetic energy equal to 1.39 ev .",
    "if we assume that the molecule undergoes bending motion during the fragmentation , assuming symmetric fragmentation of the two s - h bonds , the minimum and maximum kinetic energies are found to be 1.34 ev ( @xmath34 ) and 1.43 ev ( @xmath35 ) respectively .",
    "however , this does not explain the kinetic energy distribution seen below 1.3 ev and extending down to thermal energies .",
    "there are two possible ways this may happen .",
    "s atom has electronic excited states , and which are 1.15 ev and 2.75 ev above the ground state @xcite .",
    "if the s atom is formed in either of these states , the excess kinetic energy would be correspondingly reduced to give the kinetic energy from an instantaneous three body break as 0.83 ev and 0.05 ev respectively .",
    "the second possibility is for the fragmentation to occur in a sequential process through an intermediate state . in this case",
    "the h atom could take away most of the excess kinetic energy .",
    "the subsequent fragmentation of could produce with low kinetic energies below 1.3 ev .",
    "we have observed a similar behaviour of the kinetic energy spectrum of in the 12 ev resonance in water .",
    "there we could clearly identify the low kinetic energy release as due to a sequential fragmentation through an state and rule out the production of excited o atoms . here in the case of",
    ", we are unable to distinguish the two possibilities .",
    "the @xmath36 velocity images at 9.6 ev and 10.4 ev - figures [ fig4.3](g ) and ( h ) show a distinct forward - backward ring along with a small central blob with near zero energy .",
    "these appear to be superimposed on a fairly uniform intensity distribution .",
    "the kinetic energy distributions of in figure [ fig4.9](b ) peak below 0.1 ev with tails extending beyond 0.3 ev . using equation 4.2 above",
    ", we can see that the kinetic energy distribution expected for via the + h + h channel ( threshold : 5.4 ev ) at 9.6 ev and 10.4 ev electron energy range from 0 to 0.25 ev and 0 to 0.29 ev respectively assuming an instantaneous three body breakup process .",
    "the tails we see extending beyond these energy ranges are from the imaging process .",
    "the forward - backward rings of @xmath36 result from a dissociation process where the bond angle of decreases from @xmath6 to close to @xmath34 upon electron attachment and consequently , the is ejected out either in forward or backward angles with respect to the electron beam .",
    "the central blob in the velocity image with close to zero energy may correspond to the formation of when the bond angle increases to @xmath35 or through the sequential fragmentation process where it is left with near zero energy .",
    "the angular distribution of and ions produced via various dissociation channels across the resonance at 9.0 ev , 9.6 ev and 10.4 ev are plotted in figure [ fig4.10 ] .",
    "the red curves in each of the plots are fits obtained using the symmetry function taking @xmath12 and @xmath13 partial waves and fit to the 9.6 ev data .",
    "the fits in figure [ fig4.10](a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) are for ions and obtained by assuming the dissociation of one of the sh bonds ( oriented at @xmath7 with respect to the molecular symmetry axis ) in ground state equilibrium geometry of the neutral molecule . whereas the fit in figure [ fig4.10](d ) is for ions obtained assuming that the ion is ejected along axis .",
    "hence , the dissociation axis is same as the molecular symmetry axis ( i.e. @xmath34 ) and this is taken into account while fitting the data with the symmetry curves . in case of ions from the three channels ,",
    "the fit is predominantly due to a @xmath12-wave component with very little @xmath13-wave contribution ( @xmath37=1:0.05 and @xmath23 @xmath38 0 ) .",
    "the fit qualitatively reproduces the forward - backward distribution with a dip in between but is far from being a good fit and thus , suggests that the dissociation is not describable by the axial recoil based fits .",
    "similar is the case for , where the only resemblance between the data and the fit is the dip about the @xmath14 , but seriously in disagreement at forward - backward angles .",
    "the ratio of @xmath12 to @xmath13 partial waves is 1:1.8 with a phase difference of 1.7 radians .",
    "we believe that the major contribution to the deviation from axial recoil approximation is the bending mode vibrations in the molecule .",
    "such a process has been seen at the 8.5 ev and 12 ev resonances in water .",
    "+      as mentioned earlier , the overall kinematics of the 9.6 ev resonance in is very similar to that of the 11.8 ev resonance in .",
    "this includes the three possible dissociation channels as well as the sequential process in the three - body break up channel with and as the respective intermediate species .",
    "a comparison of the angular distributions of fragment ions in and shows two distinct features ( see figure [ fig4.11 ] ) . in the case of water the angular distributions of and showed distinct forward - backward anisotropy with being ejected strongly in the backward direction while being ejected predominantly in the forward direction .",
    "these angular distributions are found to be independent of electron energy across the resonance .",
    "in contrast to the case of , the angular distribution of the fragment ions from at this resonance appear to be in better conformity with what is expected of a resonance as seen in figure [ fig4.10 ] .",
    "we also note that unlike the case of , where the from the three dissociation channels appear to have fairly different angular distributions , that from seems to have relatively similar angular distributions in all the three channels . also , the angular distribution of from shows strong energy dependence across the resonance as seen clearly in the + sh ( @xmath30 ) channel angular distribution plots in figure [ fig4.10](b ) .",
    "at 9 ev the forward angles have more intensity while at 10.4 ev the backward angles have more intensity . at 9.6 ev",
    ", the intensity distribution appears to be more or less symmetric about @xmath14 .",
    "+    in conclusion , the 9.6 ev resonance in and the 11.8 ev resonance in are found to be very similar in the dissociation kinematics .",
    "based on the kinetic energy distribution , we find that the formation of from these resonances occurs through three different channels leading to the formation of sh ( oh ) in the ground state ( @xmath1 ) , sh ( oh ) in the first electronically excited state ( @xmath30 ) and the three - body fragmentation .",
    "it is also seen that the three - body fragmentation has a contribution arising from a sequential process through an intermediate ( ) state .",
    "while the dissociation pathways seem very similar , the angular distributions of the fragments show contrasting behaviour . in the case of ,",
    "the and are preferentially emitted in opposite hemispheres , while in the case of we do not observe such strong asymmetry . the fits for the angular distribution data using the axial recoil approximation agrees reasonably well with a symmetry in the case of , while the unusual angular distribution in show considerable deviation .",
    "we also note that the angular distributions from in all the channels are relatively independent of electron energy , while in it appears to be quite sensitive to the electron energy across the resonance .",
