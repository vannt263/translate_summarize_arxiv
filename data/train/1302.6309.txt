    "online social networks ( e.g. , facebook , google+ , flickr ) have become increasingly important platforms for interacting with people , processing information and diffusing social influence . understanding and modeling the mechanisms by which these networks evolve are therefore fundamental issues and active areas of research .",
    "one related emerging topic is to understand and predict the formation of reciprocal edges  @xcite , the growing interest of which is highlighted by its importance in applications such as directed social network modeling , friend recommendation , information propagation , network compression  @xcite and targeted spamming , etc .    in spite of the importance of reciprocity in social networks , there have been few studies on it with two recent exceptions .",
    "one is the work done by cheng et al .",
    "they treated the reciprocity prediction as a supervised learning problem . with a network constructed from the directed @-messages sent between users on twitter",
    ", they identified a set of predictive features such as common neighbors and two - step paths extracted from network structure .",
    "the other nice work was done by hopcroft et al .",
    "@xcite , who constructed a semi - supervised learning model for reciprocity prediction . with a directed twitter follower network",
    ", they identified more predictive features such as status homophily , interactions ( e.g. , retweeting and replying tweets ) and structural balance  @xcite .",
    "however , treating reciprocity prediction as a supervised or a semi - supervised learning problem could incur a serious issue . specifically , given a network snapshot ,",
    "these approaches treat reciprocal edges as positive examples and sample some unreciprocal edges as negative examples to train the models .",
    "unfortunately , these sampled unreciprocal edges are also test examples in the next snapshot .",
    "moreover , some of them might have turned to be positive ( i.e. , reciprocally linked back ) . as a result , the better the trained models are , the worse generalization performances they possibly achieve .",
    "in fact , in the reciprocity prediction setting , we can only observe positive examples .",
    "furthermore , the structure and evolution of reciprocal and unreciprocal edges are largely unexplored .",
    "it s also unclear that how user behaviors ( e.g. , tendencies of reciprocally linking back ) , node attributes ( e.g. , school , employer and major derived from users profiles ) and edge attributes ( e.g. , edge age ) influence the formation of reciprocal edges .    in this paper ,",
    "we first study the structure and evolution of reciprocal and unreciprocal edges in google+ and flickr social networks . specifically",
    ", we find that reciprocal edges mainly link users with similar degrees while unreciprocal edges mainly connect ordinary users ( i.e. , users with low degrees ) and popular users ( e.g. , celebrities ) .",
    "however , the impacts of reciprocal edges linking ordinary and popular users on the network structures become increasingly significant as the social networks evolve .",
    "second , we observe that user behaviors , node attributes and edge attributes all have significant influences on the formation of reciprocal edges .",
    "for example , sharing common schools triples the probability of reciprocally linking back to an unreciprocal edge .",
    "these measurement results inform us the designs of reciprocity prediction features .",
    "third , in contrast to previous studies that treat reciprocity prediction as either a supervised or a semi - supervised learning problem , we model reciprocity prediction as an outlier detection problem . finally , we perform extensive evaluations with the google+ and flickr datasets , and demonstrate that our proposal outperforms previous reciprocity prediction approaches .",
    "in this section , we begin with the introduction of a few notations .",
    "then , we describe our novel google+ dataset and the publicly available flickr dataset .",
    "we denote a directed social network as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are respectively the set of nodes and edges .",
    "we will elaborate how the nodes and edges are constructed when describing the datasets .",
    "moreover , the snapshot of @xmath3 at time @xmath4 is denoted as @xmath5 .    a directed edge @xmath6 is called as a _ friend request _",
    "if the reverse directed edge @xmath7 does not exist yet or appears after @xmath6 , otherwise it s called as a _",
    "friend acceptance_. moreover , following the terminology in social science  @xcite , we also classify edges be to _ parasocial _ and _ reciprocal_. specifically , a directed edge @xmath8 is called parasocial if the reverse directed edge @xmath7 does not exist yet , otherwise it s called reciprocal . according to the definitions , parasocial edges are friend requests that havent been accepted yet .",
    "figure  [ outlier ] illustrates these concepts .",
    "for instance , in @xmath5 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath7 are friend requests , @xmath11 is a friend acceptance , @xmath9 and @xmath11 are reciprocal edges and @xmath10 and @xmath7 are parasocial edges .",
    "we can undirect a directed social network @xmath0 to two undirected versions , i.e. , _ parasocial version _ @xmath12 and _ reciprocal version _",
    "@xmath13 , which satisfy that @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "intuitively , the reciprocal version consists of undirected reciprocal edges while the parasocial version includes both undirected reciprocal and parasocial edges .    for a node @xmath17",
    ", we denote its _ incoming neighbors _ as @xmath18 and _ indegree _ as @xmath19 , _ outgoing neighbors _ as @xmath20 and _ outdegree _ as @xmath21 , _ parasocial neighbors _ as @xmath22 and _ parasocial degree _ as @xmath23 , and _ reciprocal neighbors _ as @xmath24 and _ reciprocal degree _ as @xmath25 .",
    "assume nodes also have binary attributes ( e.g. , google inc . , computer science , etc .",
    "for each binary attribute @xmath26 , we denote its _ social neighbors _ @xmath27 as the set of nodes in @xmath1 that have the attribute @xmath26 , and _ social degree _ as @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , we denote the set of attributes of a node @xmath17 as @xmath29 and _ attribute degree _ as @xmath30 .",
    "* google+ : *   google+ was launched with an invitation - only test phase on june 28 , 2011 , and opened to everyone 18 years of age or older on september 20 , 2011 .",
    "google+ provides each user with an incoming friend list ( i.e. , `` have you in circles '' ) , an outgoing friend list ( i.e. , `` in your circles '' ) and a profile page .",
    "we began to crawl daily snapshots of public google+ social network structures and user profiles shortly after it was launched ; our dataset consists of 79 snapshots crawled from july 6 to october 11 , 2011 ( i.e. , 98 days ) .",
    "the first snapshot was crawled by breadth - first search ( without early stopping ) . on subsequent days",
    ", we expanded the social structure from the previous snapshot . for most snapshots ,",
    "our crawl finished within one day as google did not limit the crawling rate during that time .",
    "the 79 snapshots are denoted as @xmath31 , where superscripts are the normalized crawling dates of the snapshots .",
    "note that 19 snapshots are missing in our dataset .",
    "we take each user @xmath17 in google+ as a node , and connect it to her outgoing friends via outgoing edges and incoming friends via incoming edges . apart from the social structure",
    ", nodes also have attributes derived from users profiles .",
    "we adopt four attribute types , i.e. , _ school _ , _ major _ , _ employer _ and _ city_. specifically , we find all distinct schools , majors , employers and cities that appear in at least one crawled user profile and use them as binary attributes . around 22% of users",
    "have nonempty profiles and thus have observed node attributes in the last snapshot .",
    "gong et al .",
    "@xcite roughly divided the evolution of google+ into three phases : phase i from day 1 to day 20 , which corresponds to the early days of google+ whose size increased dramatically ; phase ii from day 21 to day 75 , during which google+ went into a stabilized increasing phase ; and phase iii from day 76 to day 98 , when google+ was opened to public ( i.e. , without requiring an invitation ) , resulting in a dramatic growth again .",
    "we point out the three phases because we will show in section  [ sec : struct ] that reciprocal edges also evolve differently in them .",
    "* flickr : *   flickr is a photo - sharing site based on a social network , and it provides each user a friend list .",
    "this flickr dataset , obtained from mislove et al .",
    "@xcite , consists of two parts .",
    "one has 32 snapshots crawled daily between november 2nd , 2006 and december 3rd , 2006 , and the other has 102 snapshots crawled daily between february 3rd , 2007 and may 18th , 2007 . since there is a two - month gap between the two parts , we adopt the second one in our study to avoid the influence of the missing data .",
    "moreover , we denote these snapshots as @xmath32 .",
    "we take each user as a node and connect it to her friends via outgoing edges . note",
    "that this flickr dataset does nt have node attributes information .",
    "* dataset summary : *   table  [ table : net_stat ] shows the statistics of a few basic network metrics of the largest snapshots of the google+ and flickr datasets .",
    "reciprocity in the table is the fraction of friend requests that are already accepted .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ exp - data ]    * comparisons : *   we compare the following approaches .    *",
    "svm - r * binary svm  @xcite with the random sampling strategy to sample the negative examples .",
    "* svm - a * binary svm with the edge - age sampling strategy .    * trifg - r * trifg  @xcite is a semi - supervised learning framework based on a factor graphical model . apart from all the features discussed in section",
    "[ sec : feature ] , trifg also incorporates _ structural balance _",
    "@xcite by modeling it as a factor in the factor graphical model .",
    "so we also extract structural balance features as was done in hopcroft  @xcite when testing trifg .",
    "trifg - r samples the negative examples with the random sampling strategy .",
    "* trifg - a * trifg with the edge - age sampling strategy .",
    "* oc - svm * one - class support vector machine  @xcite is an outlier detector with known positive examples .",
    "note that we do nt need to sample negative examples for oc - svm .",
    "we only consider linear kernels for svm and oc - svm due to scalability issues .",
    "we use libsvm for oc - svm implementation and liblinear for svm implement .",
    "liblinear s linear svm implementation is much faster than libsvm s .",
    "however , liblinear does nt have oc - svm implementation for now .",
    "trifg implementation was obtained from the authors  @xcite .",
    "all these algorithms were run on a machine with 500 gb main memory and 32 cores .",
    "* data normalization : *   we ensemble all the feature vectors into a feature matrix , rows of which correspond to edges and columns of which correspond to features .",
    "it s well known that the performances of many machine learning algorithms are sensitive to data normalizations .",
    "so we apply three normalization techniques to this feature matrix .",
    "they are i ) _ column normalization _ , which normalizes each column of the feature matrix to have mean 0 and variance 1 , ii ) _ row normaliztion _ , which normalizes each row to have l2 norm 1 , and iii ) _ column - row normaliztion _ , which sequentially applies column and row normalizations to the feature matrix .",
    "we find that algorithms tested in the following perform the best with different normalization techniques .",
    "however , we will only show the results with the best normalization due to the limited space .    *",
    "metric : *   the number of reciprocal and parasocial edges are highly imbalanced in the test phase .",
    "thus accuracy is not an appropriate metric .",
    "for instance , a naive model which always outputs negative can already achieve test accuracy 0.986 in flickr and 0.927 in google+ .",
    "so , as was done in hopcroft et al .",
    "@xcite , we adopt precision , recall and f1 as the metrics .",
    "precision is the portion of predicted positive examples that are true reciprocal edges .",
    "recall is the portion of true reciprocal edges that are predicted as positive .",
    "f1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall .",
    "figure  [ result ] shows the test performances of the approaches as functions of the sampling ratio @xmath33 .",
    "@xmath34 corresponds to the scenario in which all parasocial edges are sampled as negative examples .",
    "we have the following observations .",
    "* oc - svm v.s .",
    "svm and trifg : *   oc - svm achieves better f1 scores than svm and trifg approaches in both google+ and flickr datasets . on one hand , svm and",
    "trifg approaches sample some parasocial edges as negative examples in the training phase .",
    "however , around 7.3% and 1.4% of them are also test positive examples in google+ and flickr respectively , which cause bad test performances . on the other hand , oc - svm does nt use the parasocial edges in the training phase , thus avoids this issue .    *",
    "random sampling v.s",
    ". edge - age sampling : *   edge - age sampling achieves better recall than random sampling for both svm and trifg approaches .",
    "we take svm with the sampling ratio @xmath35 and google+ as an example to illustrate the reason .",
    "specifically , 875,989 sampled negative examples are actually test positive examples with random sampling and 580,726 of them are classified as negative in the training and test phases .",
    "however , the number of such examples decreases to 567,620 with edge - age sampling and 440,346 of them are classified as negative .",
    "the behavior of precision is more complicated .",
    "specifically , edge - age sampling slightly helps trifg but makes svm perform worse . the reason might be that edge - age sampling samples a biased subset of the parasocial edges , which decreases svm - a s precision .",
    "* impacts of the sampling ratio : *   for svm approaches , precision increases and recall decreases as the sampling ratio @xmath33 increases .",
    "on one hand , a larger @xmath33 treats more parasocial edges as training negative examples and thus classifies more test reciprocal edges as negative , which explains the decreasing recall . on the other hand",
    ", a larger @xmath33 also correctly classifies more test parasocial edges as negative and thus decreases the number of test parasocial edges among the predicted reciprocal edges , which increases the precision .",
    "however , the behavior of the f1 score depends on datasets .",
    "specifically , svm s performances increase in google+ but decrease in flickr when @xmath33 goes to 0 .",
    "interestingly , trifg approaches are relatively robust to the selection of @xmath33 with respect to all the three metrics .",
    "we speculate the reason is that trifg incorporates structural balance information .",
    "* measuring reciprocity : *   garlaschelli and loffredo  @xcite measured reciprocity in various networks ( e.g. , www , email networks , etc . ) .",
    "akoglu et al .",
    "@xcite quantified reciprocity in weighted communication networks ( e.g. , phone call network ) .",
    "cheng et al .",
    "@xcite found that reciprocal version has a higher average clustering coefficient than parasocial version in their twitter interaction network , which implies that friendship networks ( e.g. , google+ and flickr ) and the interaction network have different local structures of reciprocal and parasocial edges .",
    "hopcroft et al .",
    "@xcite found that , in a twitter follower network , network structure , users social status and interactions influence the formation of reciprocal edges .",
    "* predicting reciprocity : *   cheng et al .",
    "@xcite treated reciprocity prediction as a supervised learning problem .",
    "hopcroft et al .",
    "@xcite constructed a semi - supervised learning framework for reciprocity prediction .",
    "these approaches require negative training examples , which are sampled from parasocial edges . unfortunately , these sampled negative examples are also test examples , and some of them will turn to be positive in the test phase , which possibly decreases the generalization performances . on the contrary , we identify the reciprocity prediction is better modeled as an outlier detection problem .    *",
    "differences with other link mining tasks : *   reciprocity prediction is related to a few other link mining tasks such as _ link prediction _ and _ link sign prediction _ , and _ link type prediction _ , but they are essentially different .    the classical link prediction problem aims to identify links that are missing in the current social network snapshot but are possible to appear in the near future  @xcite .",
    "reciprocity prediction and link prediction differ in several important aspects .",
    "first , previous work  @xcite has shown that features working well for link prediction are not the most effective ones for reciprocity prediction .",
    "second , in the setting of reciprocity prediction , a parasocial edge @xmath8 already exists between @xmath17 and @xmath36 , from which we can extract features ( e.g. , edge age ) .",
    "the link sign prediction  @xcite classifies social relationships to be either positive ( e.g. , friendship ) or negative ( e.g. , opposition or antagonism ) .",
    "this forms interesting contrasts with reciprocity prediction in the sense that reciprocal and parasocial links can easily exhibit either type of sign .",
    "the link type prediction  @xcite assigns relationship categories ( e.g. , advisor - advisee , classmate ) to a pair of users .",
    "this problem implicitly treats the relationships between people as symmetric , i.e. , @xmath8 and @xmath37 should belong to the same category , which makes it fundamentally different from reciprocity prediction .",
    "in this paper , we first study the structure and evolution of reciprocal and parasocial edges in google+ and flickr .",
    "we find that reciprocal edges mainly connect users with similar degrees while parasocial edges mainly link _ ordinary _ users ( e.g. , low - degree users ) and _ popular _ users ( e.g. , celebrities ) .",
    "however , the impacts of reciprocal edges linking ordinary and popular users on the network structures become increasingly significant as the social networks evolve . moreover , parasocial edges , although making nodes parasocial neighbors more than their reciprocal neighbors , connect the parasocial neighbors more tightly .",
    "second , we find that user behaviors , node and edge attributes all have significant influences on the formation of reciprocal edges .",
    "third , in contrast to previous studies that treat reciprocity prediction as either a supervised or a semi - supervised learning problem , we identify that reciprocity prediction is better modeled as an outlier detection problem .",
    "finally , we perform extensive evaluations with the google+ and flickr datasets , and demonstrate that our proposal outperforms previous ones .    one interesting future work could be to design a directed network model that matches real networks with respect to not only directed network metrics but also undirected ones of the corresponding parasocial and reciprocal versions .",
    "it s also interesting to design an outlier detecter incorporating the structural balance features .",
