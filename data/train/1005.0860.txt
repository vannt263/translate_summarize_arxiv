    "this is accomplished by parametrizing the helmholtz free energy density as a function of @xmath1 and baryon density @xmath6 in an appropriate fashion .",
    "perhaps the closest work that addressed some of these issues blended a parameterization of the 3d ising model equation of state into quark and hadron equations of state @xcite .",
    "these two parameterizations can perhaps be viewed as alternatives which provide some idea as to the range of uncertainty in how to describe matter near the chiral critical point .",
