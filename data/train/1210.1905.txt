    "probing correlation length scales in amorphous systems has become the subject of much current activity due to their important role in understanding the physical mechanism of the glass transition  @xcite . since the collective nature of the dynamics of supercooled liquids approaching the glass transition point has already indicated the existence of a growing dynamic length scale  @xcite , a deeper understanding of the correlation length scales allows to explain the glassy phenomena such as slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "for example , evidence has been provided by studying higher - order static correlations  @xcite or analyzing local geometric structures  @xcite that slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity possess some structural features in some model glass - formers , which sheds insight into the structural origin of slow dynamics in glass - forming liquids . on the other hand ,",
    "the study of correlation length scales could facilitate the testing of theoretical predictions since most theories of the glass transition have treated characteristic length scales as a key ingredient  @xcite .",
    "moreover , understanding of the glass transition has been improved recently by studying the point - to - set correlations due to their generic features in describing spatial information of glass - forming liquids  @xcite .",
    "the growing dynamic length scale in glass - forming liquids has triggered a large body of work to search connections between dynamics and structure  @xcite .",
    "in this situation , conventional methods such as the static pair correlations can not be used to detect structural order since they do not show dramatic change on the approach to the glass transition point . instead , the higher - order static correlations has been frequently emphasized within the glass community .",
    "an intriguing result , emerging in recent years , is that the bond orientational order has been suggested to be the origin of slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity in the so - called weakly frustrated glass - forming liquids  @xcite . by using polydispersity to control the strength of frustration , kawasaki and coworkers  @xcite have shown that in a weakly frustrated glass - forming liquid there exist transient clusters of highly ordered particles , whose size and lifetime increase towards the glass transition point .",
    "they also found that particles in the clusters are less mobile than others and that both dynamic length ( characterizing the increasing heterogeneity of the dynamics ) and structural length ( characterizing the spatial extension of the local bond orientational order ) tend to diverge at the ideal glass transition point . thus it may suggest a static thermodynamic origin of dynamic heterogeneity rather than a purely dynamic one at least for the weakly frustrated glass - forming liquids .",
    "however , there are also studies which show a decoupling between the structural correlation length and the dynamic one , e.g. , sausset and tarjus  @xcite observed that the static correlation length of a weakly glass - forming liquid in negatively curved space first grows and then saturates as temperature decreases whereas the dynamic correlation length always increases with decreasing temperature .",
    "therefore , even in the weakly frustrated glass - forming liquids , the origin of slow dynamics and dynamic heterogeneity is still unclear and whether the bond orientational order can provide a complete description of dynamic heterogeneity remains elusive .    in this work ,",
    "we examine the connection between dynamic heterogeneity and bond orientational order in a weakly frustrated glass - forming liquid by taking advantage of assessing the effect of attractions on the correlation length scales .",
    "our study is inspired by the results of effect of attractions on the structure and the dynamics of liquids , which has been reevaluated recently in the context of glass formation  @xcite . by comparing the static pair structure and the relaxation dynamics of a binary lennard - jones ( denoted by lj in the following ) glass - former and its corresponding purely repulsive variant ( proposed by weeks , chandler and andersen  @xcite and denoted by wca in the following )",
    ", berthier and tarjus  @xcite have shown that attractions can affect the relaxation dynamics of liquids in both quantitative and qualitative ways but have little effect on the static pair correlations . from these results",
    ", one can also expect significant effect of attractions on dynamic heterogeneity of supercooled liquids since it has been well established that the dynamic slowing down accompanies the development of dynamic heterogeneity .",
    "thus , a crucial test of the role of bond orientational order in weakly frustrated glass - forming liquids can be made by examining whether similar effect of attractions occurs on bond orientational order and the associated static correlation length or not .",
    "we demonstrate via molecular dynamics simulation that attractions can strongly affect the dynamic heterogeneity of the liquid and the associated dynamic correlation length .",
    "however , their influence on the bond orientational order and the associated static correlation length shows a different manner and is reminiscent of the effect of attractions on the thermodynamics of liquids . in the supercooled regime ,",
    "dependence of the dynamic correlation length on the structural relaxation time is nearly the same and shows a power - law relation for models with and without attractions .",
    "although we can also identify a power - law relation between the static correlation length and the structural relaxation time in the same temperature range , the exponent of the power laws for the two models is not the same .",
    "this implies that the growth of bond orientational order and static correlation length scale might be merely a manifestation of favoring the configurational entropy in weakly frustrated glass - forming liquids .",
    "thus , our results lead strong evidence that the bond orientational order can not provide a complete description of dynamic heterogeneity even in weakly frustrated glass - forming systems .",
    "we compare the dynamical and structural properties of a lj glass - forming liquid in two dimensions as well as its corresponding wca variant .",
    "the pair potential for the two systems is given by @xmath0 , & \\text{for $ r < r_{jk}^{c}$}\\\\ 0 , & \\text{otherwise , } \\end{array}\\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath1 is the depth of the potential well , @xmath2 is the distance between two particles and @xmath3 with @xmath4 the diameter of particle @xmath5 , @xmath6 is equal to the position of the minimum of @xmath7 for the wca model ( i.e. , @xmath8 ) and to a conventional cutoff of @xmath9 for the lj model , and @xmath10 is constant which is fixed such that @xmath11 .",
    "the difference between the two potentials is that the lj potential has a long - ranged attractive tail while the wca potential has only one short - ranged repulsive component . to form a weakly frustrated glass - forming system , the particle diameters uniformly distribute in the range @xmath12 with an interval of @xmath13 , then the size polydispersity for the system",
    "is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is the average of the corresponding variable among all the particles .",
    "such system prevents occurrence of crystallization and tends to form a local hexagonal structure , and one can readily identify the static structural order and detect the corresponding spatial correlations .",
    "we employed molecular dynamics simulation for a system with the particle number @xmath16 in the @xmath17 ensemble , where newton s equations of motion are integrated with the velocity form of the verlet algorithm under periodic boundary conditions and the temperature @xmath18 is maintained by the nos - hoover thermostat  @xcite .",
    "all the particles have the same mass @xmath19 .",

    "the time step is @xmath24 .",
    "the number density is fixed at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) with @xmath27 the box dimension .",
    "we also performed simulations for a system with @xmath28 ( @xmath29 ) in order to check the possible finite size effects and we found that similar effect of attractions also occurs for the smaller system .",
    "we note that the finite size effects do affect the results of dynamic correlation length in simulations , as pointed out recently  @xcite . however , our aim is to correctly identify the effect of attractions on the correlation length scales , rather than to quantify a true liquid .",
    "thus , we only present the results for the system with @xmath16 in this paper . at each state point",
    ", the system was first equilibrated for at least @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the structural relaxation time and see below for its definition ) before collecting data . in order to obtain reliable results and improve the statistics",

    "in this section , we first compare the relaxation dynamics and the static pair correlations of lj and wca models .",

    "the typical results are shown in fig",
    "consistent with the results in a binary glass - former  @xcite , we observe that although the difference of @xmath43 between the two systems is very small at high temperatures , it becomes significant as the liquid enters the supercooled regime where typical two - step relaxation process occurs .",
    "this phenomenon can be more clearly seen from the dependence of the structural relaxation time @xmath31 on @xmath18 , which is shown in fig .",
    "here , we define @xmath31 as @xmath44 ( we have checked that choosing other reasonable values will not alter the qualitative results ) .",
    "we find that @xmath31 for the two models is almost identical at @xmath45 , but @xmath31 of the lj model is over @xmath46 orders of magnitude larger than that of the wca model at @xmath47 .",
    "we can also confirm the quantitative effect of attractions by comparing the mode - coupling glass transition point @xmath48 of the two models , as determined by power - law fittings of @xmath31 ( i.e. , @xmath49 )  @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in the inset of fig .",
    "1(b ) and we find that @xmath50 is significantly larger than @xmath51 for the studied density ( note that the difference between them will become smaller at higher densities  @xcite ) .",
    "as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite , the effect of attractions on the dynamics is not only quantitative but also qualitative .",
    "the latter was evidenced by the absence in the wca model of the density scaling of @xmath31 which holds in the lj model .",
    "we have also calculated the relaxation times at various number densities ( ranging from @xmath52 to @xmath53 ) for the system with @xmath28 and found the distinct qualitative behavior for the two models .",
    "thus , the quantitative and qualitative effects of attractions on the relaxation dynamics are independent of dimensionality and should be universal in glass - forming liquids .",
    "we present the results of the static pair correlations for the two systems at several temperatures in fig .",
    "2 . clearly",
    ", attractions have negligible effects on the pair correlation function @xmath54 and the static structure factor @xmath55 even in the supercooled regime .",
    "it should be noted that although the long - range positional order is obviously prevented in the two systems , the splitting second peaks in both @xmath54 and @xmath55 become more apparent as @xmath18 decreases ( note that this phenomenon is more evident for @xmath55 ) , which suggests the development of the locally preferred order with decreasing @xmath18 and provides evidence that the model here has only weak frustration .",
    "the negligible effect of attractions on the static pair correlations indicates that the large difference seen in the relaxation dynamics can not be explained at the static pair level  @xcite .",
    "in fact , it has been shown that considering locally preferred structures and higher - order static correlations can help to rationalize the effect of attractions on the relaxation dynamics  @xcite . in the following",

    "9 . as can be seen in the upper panel of fig . 9 , the dependence of @xmath65 on @xmath31 is almost the same for lj and wca models and follows power - law relations ( the exponent of the power law decreases from @xmath91 in the high temperature regime to @xmath92 in the supercooled regime ) , indicating that slow dynamics always accompanies growing dynamic length scales irrespective of attractions . here",
