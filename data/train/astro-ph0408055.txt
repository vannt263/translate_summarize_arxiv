    "the whole set of models presented here has been produced using the stellar structure and evolution code cles ( code ligeois devolution stellaire ) : opal01 eos ; opal96 opacity tables plus alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) at @xmath0  k ; nuclear reaction rates from @xcite ; mlt convection treatment ; microscopic diffusion of all the elements using the subroutine by @xcite ; atmospheric boundary conditions given by kurucz ( 1998 ) at @xmath1 .",
    "we have used the revised o ( asplund et  al .",
    "2004a ) c , n and ne abundances ( asplund et  al .",
    "2004b ) ( mix2 ) .",
    "eos and opacity tables have been constructed with this mixture .",
    "the calibrated model ( model s2 , see table 1 ) is very different from the one ( model s1 ) obtained with the @xcite mixture ( mix1 ) with regards to the distribution of the sound speed as can be seen in fig .",
    "we have tried different numerical experiments in order to reduce this discrepancy :    * the opal opacity near the base of the convective zone has been increased in three different ways . in models labeled seaton ( model o1 ) ,",
    "the differences between the revised op and opal opacities @xcite near 2.10@xmath2  k are taken into account ( fig .",
    "2 , solid line ) .",
    "models labeled bahcall 1 and bahcall 2 are constructed according to the suggestion from @xcite ( fig .",
    "2 , long dashed - dashed and dashed lines ) .",
    "figure 1b shows that the best agreement is obtained with bahcall 1 ( model o2 ) which means an increase of 14% in the opacity at the base of the convective envelope .",
    "this model is still far from the s1 model ( dotted line in fig .",
    "* the diffusion velocities have been increased by factors 1.5 and 2 .",
    "figure 1c shows that a better sound speed distribution can be reached either by multiplying by a factor 2 the diffusion velocities ( model d1 ) or by multiplying them by 1.5 and increasing the z / x ratio by 10% ( model d4 ) which is the precision range for this ratio for the sun . *",
    "figures 1b and 1c suggest that the best agreement is reached by increasing both the opacity at the base of the convective envelope and the diffusion velocities .",
    "figure 1d shows the effect of an increase of @xmath3% in the opacity ( solid line and dashed line in fig.2 ) and an increase in the diffusion velocities by 50% ( models d2 and d3 ) .",
    "both results are much better than those obtained by only increasing the opacity by 14% .",
    "we have checked that the new @xmath4 astrophysical s - factor @xcite has no effect on the solar calibration .",
    "the numerical experiments presented here suggest that , in order to reduce the discrepancy between the squared sound speed in the sun @xcite and that of a theoretical model with the revised c , n , o and ne abundances , a moderate increase of the opacity ( 7% ) at the base of the convective envelope should be accompanied by an increase in the diffusion velocities ( 50% ) ( models d2 and d3 ) . moreover , in these models , the depth of the convective zone is in agreement with the heliosismic value ( 0.713 , christensen - dalsgaard et  al .",
    "1991 ) while the surface he abundance is only very slightly smaller ( 0.248 , richard et  al .",
    "these results are equivalent to those obtained by basu & antia ( 2004 ) who multiplied the diffusion coefficient by a factor 1.65 , and increased the o abundance with respect to that one given by @xcite ( that is , [ o / h]=8.80 instead of 8.66 ) .",
