    "the cp thus contains signatures of the fermi surface ( fs ) breaks and correlation effects in the underlying three - dimensional ( 3d ) momentum density @xmath8 .",
    "the determination of fs geometry via the compton spectroscopy is complicated by the presence of the double integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "fs breaks in @xmath8 do not in general induce rapid variations in @xmath0 , but only in the first derivative of the profile .",
    "moreover , breaks in @xmath8 caused by fs crossings are scattered throughout momentum space with weights given by the appropriate matrix element .",
    "therefore , if this matrix element happens to be small in a specific case,@xcite then the related fs feature in the cp will be intrinsically weak and difficult to measure .",

    "the formulation so far leading to eq .",
    "( [ eq13 ] ) has been quite general .",
    "the nature of the problem as well as its solution may be delineated with reference to fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which shows schematically the projection of the bcc reciprocal lattice onto the ( 110 ) plane .",

    "( 3.8 ) ) lie at the positions of the circles .",
    "the two nearest ( 110 ) planes ( @xmath50 ) lie at a distance of @xmath51 in front of and behind this central plane and the corresponding lattice points project into the crosses .",
    "the next pair of planes projects to the circles and then the process repeats itself .",
    "the entire bcc reciprocal lattice is thus divided into two sublattices related to the circles and the crosses with associated 2d brillouin zones shown by light and dark lines respectively.@xcite it is easily seen now that when the images of the fermi surface given by the periodic lcw - folded 3d - density are projected along [ 110 ] , the contributions from the circled and crossed sublattices will overlap and get entangled . however , since the circled and crossed sublattices are related by a simple shift of @xmath52 along the @xmath53 axis , if the contribution of one of these sublattices can be suppressed in the folding procedure , the projection will no longer suffer from the aforementioned complication .",
    "the preceding strategy may be carried out more formally as follows . in the @xmath54 space ,",
    "( [ aeq9 ] ) give the coordinates of various bcc lattice points generated via the integers @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "different layers perpendicular to the [ 110 ] direction correspond to different values of @xmath55 . it is easily shown",
    "then that the circled sublattice in fig.[fig1 ] involves only _ even _ values of the index @xmath55 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( ignoring prefactors in eqs .",

    "since @xmath73 and @xmath74 are identical ( apart from the shift ) and their sum yields the occupation function @xmath46 , it follows that @xmath73 and @xmath74 each carry half the intensity of the occupation function .",

    "similar discrepancies between theory and experiment have been observed previously in other systems and can be ascribed to the failure of the present lda - based independent particle model to properly account for correlations in the electron gas.@xcite these correlation effects result in the shift of spectral weight from below to above the fermi momentum ( @xmath86 ) and a reduction in the size of the break ( @xmath87 ) in the momentum density at @xmath86 .",
    "concerning fine structure , features around 0.3 a.u . and 0.6 a.u . in the first derivative of the experimental cp",

    "these features are quite similar to those found in al in the positron annihilation ( 1d - angular correlation ) experiments@xcite as well as in the recent high - resolution compton scattering measurements.@xcite in the case of al , these have been explained by the fact that the fermi surface of al deviates from a sphere ( in the extended zone ) and bulges on the hexagonal zone face near the w - k - w and w - u - w zone edges;@xcite this mechanism is presumably at play in al-3%li as well since the addition of 3% li induces relatively little change in the fermi surface of al .    before discussing the effects of folding , it is helpful to consider fig .",

    "[ fig5](b ) , even though this is far from being the case in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) which shows the appearance of four cross - like features around the l symmetry points due to overlapping fermi surfaces . furthermore ,",
    "complicated structures arise in fig .",
    "[ fig5](a ) around the zone center .",
    "it is striking how the two overlapping fermi surfaces in fig.[fig5](a ) are disentangled in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b).@xcite these results show clearly the power of the present partial folding approach for analyzing fs images in terms of the ( 110)-projection in an fcc crystal .",
    "the application to al-3%li is considered in fig .  [ fig6 ] which compares theoretical and experimental ( 110)-projected , partially folded , 2d occupation densities . on the whole , the fs contours in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are rather like those in fig.[fig5](b ) , indicating that the fs of the alloy is more or less spherical , despite some deviations .",
    "note that the fs contours in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] are not symmetrical with respect to the u - k lines , even though this is strictly true for the free electron case in fig .",
    "[ fig5](b ) .",
    "this is a consequence of the asphericity of the fs ; the fs bulges more outside the hexagonal zone face near the w - k - w zone edge ( where two hexagonal faces of the first zone intersect ) than near the w - u - w zone edge ( intersection between a hexagonal and a square face of the first zone ) .",
    "this can also be described as a slight flattening of the fs in the vicinity of u , combined with a small expansion near k. theory and experiment are in good overall accord in fig.[fig6 ] , although the fact that the oblong maximum around the l point in fig .  [ fig6](b ) is slightly more rotated compared to fig .",
    "[ fig6](a ) suggests that the aforementioned asphericity of the fs is somewhat stronger in the experiment .",
    "finally , we consider radial cuts through the 2d momentum distribution of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ; a typical cut ( along @xmath90-l ) is shown in fig .",
    "it is well known that the value of the fermi momentum @xmath86 is not given correctly by the inflection point in the profile of fig .",

    "[ fig7](b).@xcite the situation may be simulated by considering the free electron case . here",
    "the 2d - distribution corresponding to the profile of fig.[fig7](a ) is a semi - circle and the first derivative is negative and diverges at @xmath86 .",
    "when the semi - circle is convoluted with the experimental resolution , a tail appears beyond @xmath91 and the divergence of the first derivative at @xmath91 disappears .",
    "the inflection point defining the minimum of the first derivative then moves below @xmath91 to an extent which depends on the width of the resolution function .",
    "accordingly , by using a free electron semi - circle of radius 0.919 a.u . and the present experimental resolution of 0.12 a.u . , we have determined that the position of the inflection points in cuts such as those of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] must be increased by 4.2 % in order to obtain the correct value of @xmath86 . applying this correction , theoretical and experimental @xmath86 values in the ( 110 ) plane",
    "can be mapped out from the data of fig .",
    "the results of the analysis are given in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , and show an excellent level of accord between theory and experiment .",
    "nevertheless , a careful examination of fig .  [ fig8 ] reveals a slight contraction of the experimental fs ( compared to theory ) near u in combination with a slight expansion near k , consistent with our earlier discussion in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] above .",
    "we address the question of how fermi surface ( fs ) signatures can be enhanced in the 2d distribution obtained by projecting the 3d momentum density along the [ 110 ] direction in an fcc crystal .",
    "the standard lcw folding procedure invoked in this connection involves a summation of the momentum density over all reciprocal lattice vectors to obtain the electron occupation number density in the system .",
    "this procedure has been used to produce a reasonably clear fs imprint , even when the ( 110 ) projected momentum density is considered , in several studies of bcc crystals , but it has not been successful in fcc crystals .",
    "we show , however , that the ( 110 ) projection of the lcw - folded momentum density in the fcc lattice can be viewed as a superposition of two equivalent fs images which are shifted by @xmath52 along the [ 001 ] axis , and that these two images can be disentangled if one uses a selected subset of reciprocal lattice vectors in the folding process .",
    "our novel folding procedure is particularly well suited for investigating fermiology - related issues via high resolution compton experiments where a full 3d reconstruction of the data is far more demanding than a 2d - reconstruction using measured directional profiles all of which involve scattering vectors in the ( 110 ) plane",
    ". the technique will also be valuable in analyzing positron annihilation ( 2d - acar ) experiments in fcc lattices .",
    "an extensive application of the aforementioned partial folding procedure to the case of an fcc disordered alloy is presented . to this end , we have measured nine high resolution directional compton profiles on a single crystal specimen of al-3at%li with scattering vectors in the ( 110 ) plane .",
    "we have also carried out highly accurate computations of corresponding theoretical profiles within the self - consistent , parameter free kkr - cpa framework .",
    "occupation number densities based on theoretical as well as the experimental profiles obtained via partial folding display clear images of the fs . a reasonable level of accord",
    "is found between theory and experiment with respect to the overall shape of the directional profiles as well as the fine structure in the first and the second derivatives .",
    "the experimental results with regard to the fs are also in accord with kkr - cpa predictions , although there is an indication of a slightly stronger bulging of the measured fermi surface outside the hexagonal zone face along the w - k - w than along the w - u - w zone edge . upon adding 3% li ,",
    "the fs of al remains essentially free electron like , some overall shrinking of its size due to the reduced e / a ratio notwithstanding .",
    "large fs sheets in al thus show no sign of an anomaly which might destabilize the @xmath15 phase .",
    "a fermi surface driven mechanism in this connection will therefore need to focus on small features in the fs of al ( electron pockets in the third conduction band ) which can undergo substantial change and may even disappear with decreasing electron concentration or altered electron lattice interaction upon alloying .",
