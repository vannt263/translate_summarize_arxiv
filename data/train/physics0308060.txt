    "high gain fel amplifiers are of interest for a variety of potential applications that range from x - ray lasers @xcite to ultraviolet mw - scale industrial lasers @xcite .",
    "there are various versions of the high gain fel amplifier .",
    "a number of high gain fel amplifier concepts may prove useful for xfel applications .",
    "two especially noteworthy ones are the fel amplifier with a single uniform undulator @xcite ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a1 ] ) and the distributed optical klystron @xcite ( see fig . [",
    "fig : a2 ] ) .",
    "the high gain cascade klystron amplifier described in this paper is an attractive alternative to other configurations for operation in the x - ray wavelength range ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a ] ) .",
    "let us first investigate qualitatively the processes that take place in any fel amplifier ; this investigation should also enable us to distinguish somewhat more accurately between the so - called distributed optical klystron concept and the new high gain klystron amplifier concept . in any fel , several processes must take place , either separately or simultaneously . the first process that must occur in any fel is energy modulation .",
    "energy modulation means the application of radiation fields to the electrons as they move in their trajectories under the action of undulator magnetic fields , in such a way that the energies of these electrons are varied in some periodic fashion .",
    "it is then necessary to take advantage of this phase - dependent motion .    the second process , then , that must occure in a fel is the conversion of this variation in the motion of the electrons into a usable form .",
    "it is necessary to turn the variations in the electron energy into a radiation frequency current , which can deliver energy to the electromagnetic field ; i.e. , the variations in velocity must be converted into density variations .",
    "the ways in which this conversion is brought about are numerous , and fel amplifier types are distinguished by their conversion mechanism",
    ".    it may be useful to illustrate processes at this point to see how energy modulation and conversion into density modulation take place in some of the types of fel amplifier . in a conventional high gain fel amplifier with a single uniform undulator energy modulation and bunching",
    "occurs both simultaneously and continuously along the undulator .",
    "energy modulation occurring at any one point continues to affect bunching at points beyond , with additional modulation being added as the beam moves along .",
    "the problem of electromagnetic wave amplification in the uniform undulator refers to a class of self - consistent problem . to solve the problem ,",
    "the field equations and equations of particle motion should be solved simultaneously .",
    "when the fel amplifier operates in linear regime the transverse distribution of the radiation field remains fixed , while its amplitude grows exponentially with undulator length .",
    "perhaps the simplest fel amplifier , from pedagogical point of view , is the high gain klystron amplifier .",
    "this simplicity arises from the fact that the important processes of energy modulation of the beam and subsequent conversion of the energy modulation to density modulation occur in distinctly separate regions of the fel and thus may be considered in a sequential manner .",
    "this separability of functions aids materially in developing an understanding of modulation and bunching phenomena .    in its simplest configuration",
    "the klystron amplifier consists of an input undulator ( energy modulator ) , and an output undulator ( radiator ) separated by a dispersion section . in the input undulator an incident electron beam is subjected to a radiation field , which produces an energy modulation , a modulation which after dispersion section , is converted into an density modulation in the beam . in the output undulator",
    "the bunched beam radiates coherently .",
    "this process , of conversion of energy modulation to bunching by the action of a dispersion section , is one of the characteristics of the klystron and is one of the reasons why this device is so useful in many connections .",
    "we have considered the two - undulator klystron amplifier . in some experimental situations",
    "this simplest configuration is not optimal .",
    "for example , this study has shown that in the soft x - ray wavelength range the maximal ( intensity ) gain of this amplifier does not exceed 30 - 40 db .",
    "the obvious and technically possible solution of the problem of gain increase might be to use a klystron with three or more undulators .",
    "suppose that we have a three undulator ( or so - called two - cascade ) klystron , and that we introduce a very small signal into the first undulator .",
    "this will result in a small value of the amplitude of energy modulation , and a resulting rather small power output from the second undulator .",
    "nevertheless , the radiation field amplitude in the second undulator will still be much greater than that in the first undulator , on account of the considerable amplification of the first cascade .",
    "we now disregard the power produced by the second undulator , but consider its effect on the electron beam passing through its magnetic system .",
    "the considerable radiation field in the second undulator will produce a further energy modulation of the beam and , when it emerges on the far side of the second undulator , it will have a large energy modulation , which , with a second dispersion section , will result in optimum bunching .",
    "this bunched beam then enters the third ( radiator ) undulator , and produces a large amount of power . in other words",
    ", we have essentially combined two stages of amplification by incorporating essentially two klystrons in a single unit .",
    "the final power is no greater than could be produced by a two - undulator klystron with the same output undulator , but we can secure this power with a much weaker input signal .",
    "let us consider now the problem of a periodically spaced sequence of undulators and dispersion sections , with the electron beam traversing each in succession .",
    "the larger the number of cascades the longer is the amplifier length .",
    "suppose that the increase of total length ( gain ) of amplifier is tempered by an accompanying decrease in the length ( gain ) of cascade .",
    "from this approach at very large number of cascades and small gain per cascade pass we are led to the other device , which was the subject of the papers @xcite : the `` distributed optical klystron '' . at first glance",
    "this is essentially the extension klystron amplifier , extended to a very large number of cascades .",
    "however , as noted earlier , this amplifier is considerably more complicated in principle than a klystron amplifier with high gain per cascade pass . when the gain per cascade pass is small , the cascades can not be considered independent .",
    "it is important to realize that the cascades are connected optically , so that the radiation produced , for example , into the first undulator passes on into the second and produces additional energy modulation of the beam .",
    "it is clear that we can not conveniently treat the theory of distributed klystron by the same method we used in the klystron case .",
    "because of the low gain per cascade pass used for the distributed klystron , it can not be approximated as scheme with separate functions , and the klystron amplifier theory has all based on that assumption . a quite different approach to the problem , which proves to be more suited to mathematical development of distributed klystron theory ,",
    "is more along the lines of an analogy with the theory of conventional fel amplifier with uniform undulator .",
    "the problem of electromagnetic wave amplification in the distributed klystron refers to a class of self - consistent problems .",
    "for instance , when the distributed klystron operates in linear regime its amplitude gain grows exponentially with cascade numbers . from a study of the rate of exponential build - up of the electromagnetic wave we can find the gain of the amplifier .",
    "our theory of klystron amplifier is based on the assumption that beam density modulation does not appreciably change as the beam propagates through the undulator .",
    "this approximation means that only the contributions to the radiation field arising from the initial density modulation are taken into account , and not those from the induced bunching . at very long klystron undulators",
    "we are led to device , which is the subject of the papers @xcite .",
    "two - segment high gain fel amplifier is variant of the standard high - gain fel amplifier with uniform undulator .",
    "because of the high gain per undulator pass used for this modification , it can not be approximated as scheme with separate functions .",
    "the klystron amplifier analysis is not only relevant from a pedagogical point of view .",
    "there are reasons to expect that the new concept of fel amplifier discussed here can be of interest for short wavelength applications such as x - ray sase fels .",
    "generation of x - ray radiation using klystron amplifiers has many advantages , primarily because of the separation of electronic processes , gain , and potentially low sensitivity to alignment . in principle",
    ", the gain of the klystron amplifier can be increased indefinitely by adding additional cascades along the beam . in practice , with three - cascade klystron amplifier , a gain in excess of 80 db may be obtained in the soft x - ray wavelength range . at this level , the shot noise of the beam is amplified up to saturation and a cascade klystron amplifier operates as soft x - ray sase fel .",
    "now our intention is to develop certain physical ideas about the operation of the klystron amplifier , the characteristics of its radiation , and those features that set it apart from other fel sources in the short wavelength region of the spectrum .",
    "the resonance properties of the radiation of the electron beam in the klystron can be understood as follows . since",
    "a dispersion section is a nonresonant device , the klystron bandwidth is restricted by the resonance properties of the cascade undulator , that is , by its number of periods @xmath0 .",
    "the typical amplification bandwidth of the klystron in the soft x - ray wavelength range is on the order of one percent @xmath1 .",
    "since we study the start - up from shot noise , we assume the input current to have a homogeneous spectral distribution . at large number of undulator periods the spectrum of transversely coherent fraction of radiation",
    "is concentrated within the narrow band , @xmath2 .",
    "the actual physical picture of start - up from noise should take into account that the fluctuations of current density in the electron beam are uncorrelated not only in time but in space too .",
    "thus a large number of transverse radiation modes are excited when the electron beam enters the undulator .",
    "these radiation modes have different gain .",
    "obviously , as cascade number progresses , the high gain modes will predominate more and more and we can regard the klystron as a filter , in the sense that it filters from arbitrary radiation field those components corresponding to the high gain modes . if we consider the undulator radiation from the point of view of paraxial optics , then we immediately see that the high gain modes are associated with radiation propagating along the axis of the undulator , as opposed to radiation propagating at an angle to the axis which has a low gain .",
    "consider an electron beam of radius @xmath3 moving in the ( cascade ) undulator with length @xmath4 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 can be referred to as the fresnel number . here",
    "@xmath6 is the radiation wavelength .",
    "the requirement for the mode selection to be quickly holds at small value of the fresnel number . hence ,",
    "for thin electron beam with fresnel number of @xmath7 , the emission will emerge in a single ( fundamental ) transverse mode and the degree of transverse coherence of output radiation will approach unity .    as mentioned above , amplification in each cascade",
    "is a two - step process .",
    "since we study the start - up from shot noise there is no electromagnetic field at the undulator entrance and the modulation of the beam density serves as the input signal for the klystron amplifier .",
    "the radiation field produced an ponderomotive potential across the undulator ; as is now known from general fel theory , this voltage modulates the energy of the electron beam .",
    "then the energy modulation causes modulation of the beam density in the dispersion section .",
    "if we can neglect beam bunching in the cascade undulator , the amplitude of energy modulation at the undulator exit , @xmath8 , is proportional to the resonance fourier component of beam current , @xmath9 .",
    "here @xmath10 is the initial beam microbunching at the resonant wavelength , and @xmath11 is the peak beam current .",
    "we now examine the behaviour of the electrons as they travel in a dispersion section .",
    "like the situation with usual microwave klystron , the bessel function factor @xmath12 represents the microbunching at the dispersion section exit .",
    "the parameter @xmath13 in our case is proportional to the product of the amplitude of energy modulation @xmath8 and the compaction factor of the dispersion section @xmath14 . in the high gain linear regime",
    "@xmath13 is much smaller then unity and we make the approximation @xmath15 .",
    "thus , microbunching at the cascade exit is proportional to input signal amplitude , @xmath16 .",
    "when a cascade operates in the high gain linear regime the gain per cascade pass is independent of input signal amplitude and proportional to the product of the compaction factor and the peak beam current , @xmath17 .",
    "if we build a klystron , we want to have small number of cascades and high gain .",
    "one might think that all we have to do is to get enough gain per cascade pass - we can always increase compaction factor @xmath14 and we can always increase @xmath18 , and there is no reason why we can not use the simple two - undulator klystron scheme .",
    "so the limitations of a gain per cascade pass are not that it is impossible to build a dispersion section that has a very large compaction factor .",
    "in fact , one of the main problems in klystron amplifier operation is preventing spread of microbunching due to energy spread into the electron beam .",
    "this energy spread is unimportant when the compaction factor of dispersion section is relatively small , but we shell see that energy spread is of fundamental importance in the case of very large compaction factor .",
    "to get a rough idea of the spread of the microbunching , the position of the particles within the electron bunch at the dispersion section exit has a spread which is equal to @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the local energy spread into the electron beam . and",
    "how big is @xmath21 in the spread - out microbunching ?",
    "we know that uncertainty in the phase of the particles is about @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , the largest compaction factor that we can have is approximately @xmath23 .",
    "this is what we wanted to deduce - that the gain maximum per cascade pass varies as ratio @xmath24 .",
    "it is of course desirable that the klystron gain be maximum .",
    "an experimenter can easily tune the gain of the klystron by tuning the magnetic fields in the dispersion sections .",
    "it should be pointed out that the local energy spread plays a very important role in the operation of the fel klystron amplifier , and this characteristic distinguishes the klystron from conventional fel amplifier .",
    "electron bunches with very small transverse emittance and high peak current are needed for the operation of conventional xfels .",
    "this is achieved using a two - step strategy : first generate beams with small transverse emittance using an rf photocathode and , second , apply longitudinal compression at high energy using a magnetic chicane .",
    "although simple in first - order theory , the physics of bunch compression becomes very challenging if collective effects like space charge forces and coherent synchrotron radiation forces ( csr ) are taken into account .",
    "wakefields of bunches as short as 0.1 mm have never been measured and are challenging to predict .",
    "the situation is quite different for klystron amplifier scheme described in our paper .",
    "an distinguishing feature of the klystron amplifier is the absence of apparent limitations which would prevent operation without bunch compression in the injector linac . according to our discussion above",
    ", the gain maximum per cascade pass is proportional to the peak current and inversely proportional to the energy spread of the beam .",
    "since the bunch length and energy spread are related to each other through liouville s theorem , the peak current and energy spread can not vary independently of each other in the injector linac . to extent that local energy spead is proportional to the peak current , which is usually the case for bunch compression",
    ", the gain will be independent of the actual peak current .",
    "we see , therefore , that klystron gain in linear regime depends only on the actual photoinjector parameters .",
    "this incipient proportionality between gain and @xmath25 is a temptation , in designing an xfel , to go to very high values of @xmath25 and very long values of bunch length .",
    "let us present a specific numerical example for the case of a 4th generation soft x - ray light source based on the use rf photoinjector and superconducting linac with duty factor 1 % .",
    "the average brilliance of a klystron facility operating without bunch compression in the injector linac surpasses the spontaneous undulator radiation from 3rd generation synchrotron radiation facilities by 4 or more orders of magnitude . decreasing",
    "the peak current also decreases the peak brilliance of the sase fel radiation by about of factor 100 , but this is still 6 order of magnitude higher than that of 3rd generation synchrotron radiation sources .",
    "our studies have shown that the soft x - ray cascade klystron holds great promise as a source of radiation for generating high power single femtosecond pulses .",
    "the obvious temporal limitation of the visible pump / x - ray probe technique is the duration of the x - ray probe . at a klystron facility",
    "operating without bunch compression , the x - ray pulse duration is about 10 ps .",
    "this is longer than the timescale of many interesting physical phenomena .",
    "the new principle of pump - probe techniques described in section 6 offers a way around this difficulty .",
    "section 6 also deals with the design strategy for the multi - user distribution system for an x - ray laboratory .",
    "an x - ray laboratory should serve several , may be up to ten experimental stations which can be operated independently according to the needs of the user community . on the other hand , the prefered layout of a conventional sase fel is a linear arrangement in which the injector , accelerator , bunch compressors and undulators are nearly collinear , and in which the electron beam does not change direction between accelerator and undulators .",
    "the situation is quite different for the klystron amplifier scheme proposed in our paper .",
    "since it operates without bunch compression in the injector linac , the problem of emittance dilution in the bending magnets does not exist .",
    "an electron beam distribution system based on unbunched electron beam can provide efficient ways to generate a multi - user facility - very similar to present day synchrotron radiation facilities .",
    "it may be wondered , after hearing of all of the wonderful properties of the high gain klystron amplifier , why this advance in xfel techniques occurred only this year .",
    "it should be note that the xfel which was proposed in 1982 @xcite has had nearly 20 years of development .",
    "one of the explanations is as follows .",
    "for years we were led to believe that local energy spread into electron beam which delivered from a photoinjector is relatively large .",
    "recent analysis of experimental results obtained at ttf sase fel @xcite shows that the value of the local energy spread should be revised .",
    "after bunch compression , it is expected to be about 0.2 mev ( for @xmath26 ) or smaller which is significantly less than the previously projected value of 1 mev .",
    "this decrease significantly improves operation of klystron amplifier and extends the safety margin for x - ray klystron facility operation .",
    "this paper is intended primarily for the experimental scientist or xfel program manager who has to design xfels and who wishes to undestand the operating principles of xfels .",
    "the material to be discussed provides the necessary background information required for making strategic xfel design decisions . in this paper",
    "the electronic processes that occur in an xfel will be discussed in elementary fashion .",
    "the xfel theory has a , not entirely undeserved , reputation for difficulty and obscurity .",
    "this is due partly to the complexity of systems in which ( shot ) noise is input signal and partly to the unfamiliar nature of some of the mathematical tools involved ( integrodifferential equations ) .",
    "klystron amplifiers are one of the simplest examples of high gain fel amplifiers and therefore we shall use them as an introduction to the techniques of xfel theory . in the klystron amplifier case little demand",
    "is made on the reader s mathematical ability .",
    "the mathematics that is involved is particularly simple , involving very simple differential equations and algebraic operations and no integrodifferential equations .",
    "such introduction to the operating principles of xfels has never been done before , to our knowledge .",
    "klystron amplifiers amplify the input signal . to describe the klystron amplifier operation , we first define the initial conditions .",
    "important practical kind of initial condition refers to the case when there is no radiation field at the undulator entrance and the modulation of the beam current density serves as the input signal for the amplifier . as stated in the introductory section , in undulator two physical processes",
    "take place simultaneously :    \\1 ) the modulated electron beam excites electromagnetic waves which are propagated along the undulator ;    \\2 ) the electric field components of these waves produce a modulation of the energy of the electrons .",
    "the approach discussed in this section consists of deriving for these two process separate expressions which , when joined , give quantitative information about the composite phenomena taking place in the undulator .",
    "we assume that the density modulation effect is negligible .",
    "hence , electrons passing through the first undulator receive only energy modulation , but no density modulation .",
    "density modulation present when the electrons enter the second undulator , must have developed while the electrons were traveling in the dispersion section .",
    "this effect will be discussed later .",
    "the simplest form of bunched beam is found if we have swarm of electrons , all moving in the same direction ( say the @xmath27-direction ) with the same velocity ( say @xmath28 ) , but in which the number of electrons per unit volume ( say @xmath29 ) depends on @xmath27",
    ". then if the charge on the electron @xmath30 we can easily find the current density at any value of @xmath27 .",
    "the quantity @xmath29 must really be a function of @xmath31 , on account of the velocity @xmath28 of the electrons .",
    "thus , the current density at point @xmath27 , at time @xmath32 , is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 indicates the function @xmath29 of the argument @xmath31 .",
    "unless @xmath29 is a constant independent of its argument , this will lead to a current density which varies with time .",
    "the simplest variation of @xmath29 for our present purposes is a superposition of a constant , or d - c component , and a periodic function of @xmath31 , with an angular frequency @xmath35 .",
    "first we consider the case where @xmath29 is simply a constant plus a single cosine term : @xmath36 $ ] .",
    "we must note one important fact : @xmath29 can never become negative , and hence @xmath10 can not be greater than unity .    to understand the basic principles of klystron amplifier operation , let us consider the helical undulator .",
    "the magnetic field on the axis of the helical undulator is given by    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the undulator wavenumber and @xmath39 are unit vectors directed along the @xmath40 and @xmath41 axes of the cartesian coordinate system @xmath42 .",
    "the lorentz force @xmath43 is used to derive the equations of motion of electrons with charge @xmath30 and mass @xmath44 in the presence of the magnetic field . the explicit expression for the electron velocity in the field of the helical undulator",
    "has the form :    @xmath45 \\ , \\ ] ]    which means that the electron in the undulator moves along a constrained helical trajectory parallel to the @xmath27 axis .",
    "the angle of rotation is given by the relation @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the relativistic factor and @xmath48 .",
    "as a rule , the electron rotation angle @xmath49 is small and the longitudinal electron velocity @xmath50 is close to the velocity of light , @xmath51 .",
    "let us consider a bunched relativistic electron beam moving along the @xmath27 axis in the field of a helical undulator . in what follows we use the following assumptions : i ) the electrons move along constrained helical trajectories in parallel with the @xmath27 axis ; ii ) the radius of the electron rotation in the undulator , @xmath52 , is much less than the transverse size of the electron beam .",
    "next let us assume that electron beam density at the undulator entrance is simply @xmath53 $ ] , where @xmath54 in other words we consider the case in which there are no variations in amplitude and phase of the density modulation in the transverse plane .    under these assumptions",
    "the transverse current density may be written in the form    @xmath55 \\ , \\ ] ]    where we calibrated the time in such a way that current density has its maximum at time @xmath56 , at point @xmath57 . even through the measured quantities",
    "are real , it is generally more convenient to use complex representation . for this reason , starting with real @xmath58 , one defines the complex transverse current density :    @xmath59 \\ .",
    "\\label{eq : c}\\ ] ]    transverse current have the angular frequency @xmath35 and two waves traveling in the same directions with variations @xmath60 and @xmath61 will add to give a total current proportional to @xmath62 .",
    "the factor @xmath63 indicates a fast wave , while the factor @xmath64 indicates a slow wave .",
    "the use of the word `` fast '' ( `` slow '' ) here implies a wave with a phase velocity faster ( slower ) than the beam velocity .",
    "now we should consider the electrodynamic problem .",
    "using maxwell s equations , we can write the equation for the electric field :    @xmath65    then make use of the identity    @xmath66    where @xmath67 can be found from the poisson equation . finally , we come to the inhomogeneous wave equation for @xmath68 :    @xmath69    this equation allows one to calculate the electric field @xmath70 for given charge and current sources , @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "thus , equation ( [ eq : u1 ] ) is the complete and correct formula for radiation .",
    "however we want to apply it to a still simpler circumstance in which the second term ( or , the current term ) in the right - hand side of ( [ eq : u1 ] ) provides the main contribution to the value of the radiation field . since in the paraxial approximation",
    "the radiation field has only transverse components , we are interested in the transverse component of ( [ eq : u1 ] ) .",
    "thus we consider the wave equation    @xmath73    which relates the transverse component of the electric field to the transverse component of current density .",
    "we wish to examine the case when the phase velocity of the current wave is close to the velocity of light .",
    "this requirement may be met under resonance condition    @xmath74    first we may point out that the statement of ( [ eq : s ] ) , the condition for the relation between @xmath75 and @xmath50 , is the condition for synchronism between the transverse electromagnetic wave and the fast transverse current wave with the propagating constant @xmath76 . with a current wave traveling with the same phase speed as the electromagnetic wave , we have the possibility of ( space ) resonance between electromagnetic wave and electrons .",
    "if this is the case cumulative interaction between bunched electron beam and transverse electromagnetic wave takes place .",
    "we are therefore justified in considering the contributions of all the waves except the synchronous one to be negligible .",
    "it would be nice to find an explanation of resonance condition ( [ eq : s ] ) which is elementary in the sense that we can see what is happening physically .",
    "let us call the plane electromagnetic wave velocity @xmath77 , which is of course , related to the phase constant by @xmath78 .",
    "then the velocity of the beam relative to the electromagnetic wave is merely @xmath79 . with this relative velocity , the frequency of the electromagnetic waves as seen by the electrons",
    "is give by @xmath80 , where we have used the obvious relation between the phase constant @xmath81 and the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave , @xmath82 .",
    "relation for @xmath83 can be written as @xmath84 . under the condition",
    "when ( [ eq : s ] ) holds , we see by comparison with that equation that this would be merely the undulator frequency @xmath85 .",
    "accordingly , the condition of ( [ eq : s ] ) that we have imposed is merely that the electron velocity is such that as the electron run past the electromagnetic waves , the apparent frequency they see is the undulator frequency .",
    "this is the basic effect involved in this interaction .",
    "if the apparent frequency is the undulator frequency , a cumulative effect on the electromagnetic wave results , since the waves are being driven at a frequency corresponding to natural rotation frequency of the electrons in the magnetic field .",
    "another way of saying the same thing is that in the frame of reference moving with the electrons , the electromagnetic waves have a doppler - shifted frequency equal to undulator frequency .",
    "any state of transverse electromagnetic wave can always be written as a linear combination of the two base states ( polarizations ) . by giving the amplitudes and phases of these base states",
    "we completely describe the electromagnetic wave state .",
    "it is usually best to start with the form which is physically clearest .",
    "we choose the cartesian base states and seek the solution for @xmath86 in the form    @xmath87   + { \\mathrm{c.c . } } \\label{eq : f}\\ ] ]    here and in what follows , complex amplitudes related to the field are written with a tilde .",
    "the description of the field given by ( [ eq : f ] ) is quite general .",
    "however , the usefulness of the concept of carrier wave number is limited to the case where the amplitude is slowly varying function of @xmath27 .    to determine the form of @xmath88 we substitute ( [ eq : c ] ) and ( [ eq : f ] ) into ( [ eq : u3 ] ) .",

    "now we have an apparently simple pair of equations - and they are still exact , of course .",
    "the question is , how to solve these equations ?",
    "first we simplify the equations obtained by noting that for a radiation field it is reasonable to assume that @xmath91 are slowly varying functions of @xmath27 ( because of the radiation directivity ) so that @xmath92 may be neglected .",
    "the corresponding requirement for the complex amplitude is @xmath93 . in other words ,",
    "the radiation pulse must not change significantly while traveling through a distance comparable with the wavelength @xmath94 .",

    "the peak brilliance of the conventional ttf sase fel at a wavelength of @xmath391 is about    @xmath392    on the other hand , the peak brilliance of the cascade klystron amplifier without bunch compression at a wavelength of @xmath383 is about    @xmath393    decreasing the peak current also decreases the peak brilliance of the sase fel radiation by about of factor 100 , but this is still 6 orders of magnitude higher than that of 3rd generation synchrotron radiation sources .    a cascade klystron amplifier can be modified to increase significantly the spectral brightness of output radiation .",
    "a reliable method to increase the klystron amplifier efficiency consists in an adiabatic change of the output undulator parameters ( or , in other words , by the use of so - called undulator tapering ) . when the electron bunch passes through the last dispersion section the energy modulation leads to an effective ( nonlinear ) compression of the particles",
    ". then the bunched electron beam enters a tapered output undulator , and from the very beginning produces strong radiation because of the large spatial bunching .",
    "the strong radiation field produces a ponderomotive well which is deep enough to trap the particles , since the original beam is relatively cold .",
    "the radiation produced by these captured particles increases the depth of the ponderomotive well , and they are effectively decelerated . as a result ,",
    "much higher power can be achieved than for the case of a uniform undulator .    in @xcite",
    "we have described the tapering undulator scheme for a sase fel .",
    "simulations using the code fast provide a `` full physics '' description of the process . despite the original spiking seeding the process of the electron density modulation",
    ", we effectively trap a significant fraction of the particles , and can achieve much higher power than for the case of an untapered output undulator .",
    "another important feature of the radiation from a tapered undulator is the significant suppression of the sideband growth in the nonlinear regime .",
    "this means that in the proposed scheme the spectral brightness of the radiation is increased proportionally to the radiation power . in the case of a uniform undulator",
    "the peak brightness is reached at the saturation point and is then reduced due to sideband growth .",
    "till now we have considered the electron beam as a continuous medium when describing the theory of klystron amplifier . to some extent this is idealization , since in reality the beam current is produced by a large number of moving electrons .",
    "if we consider the microstructure of the electron current , we find that electrons enter the undulator randomly in time and space .",
    "so , we can expect that the fel amplifier should possess intrinsic noise properties .",
    "here it is relevant to remember that fels form a separate class of vacuum - tube devices .",
    "the analysis of the noise properties of traditional vacuum - tube amplifiers has always been an important problem .",
    "this has been mainly connected with the practical need for reducing the intrinsic noise of the amplifier .",
    "the result of the experience obtained during these investigations shows that there always exists the fundamental effect of shot noise originating from the random emission of the electrons from the cathode .",
    "when we analyze this effect for the parameters of traditional microwave amplifiers , we find that it is complicated .",
    "in particular , suppression of the shot noise in some frequency band can occur due to space charge effects .",
    "besides the shot noise effect , there are a number of different sources of noise which influence the operation of traditional vacuum - tube amplifiers .",
    "fluctuations of the electron beam current serve as the input signal in the xfel . as for the fel amplifier operating in short wavelength range , its noise properties are defined only by the shot noise . at optical frequencies",
    "the quieting effect of space - charge limitation seems negligible . an fel amplifier which starts up from shot noise",
    "is frequently known as a self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) fel .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that such an essentially quantum terminology does not reflect the actual physics of the process .",
    "the amplification process in the sase fel has its origin in the density fluctuations in the electron beam .",
    "the latter effect is completely classical .",
    "the shot noise is the pure fluctuations in number which correspond to the fact that photoemission is a random process .",
    "the rate at which electrons are emitted from a photocathode is not constant in time .",
    "the emission process is a random one and it is impossible to predict the time dependence of the instantaneous current .",
    "any such random fluctuations in the beam current correspond to an intensity modulation of the beam current at all frequencies simultaneously - including , of course , the frequency to which the undulator is tuned .",
    "when the electron beam enters the first undulator , the presence of the beam modulation at frequencies close to the resonance frequency initiates the process of radiation .",
    "the emission of electrons from the cathode is believed to be a poisson process , and from this assumption alone the total fluctuation in current can be deduced .",
    "why is this the right rule , what is the fundamental reason for it , and how is it connected to anything else ?",
    "the explanation in deep down in quantum mechanics .",
    "when electromagnetic fields are incident on a photosurface , a complex set of events can transpire .",
    "the major steps in this process can be identified as absorption of a quantum light energy ( i.e. a photon ) and the transfer of that energy to an excited electron , transport of the excited electron to the surface , and finally , release of the electron from the surface . when laser light having a deterministic variation of intensity over space and time is incident on a photosurface , the fluctuations of the photons obey poisson statistics .",
    "this explains the relation between fundamental photon `` shot noise '' and shot noise in the electron beam .    when describing the physical principles , it is always important to find a model which provides the possibility of an analytical description without loss of essential information about the features of the random process . in the first analysis of the problem , we adopt some rather simplifying assumptions that are only occasionally met in practice .",
    "we will investigate the klystron amplifier start - up from shot noise in the framework of the one - dimensional model which assumes the input shot noise and output radiation have a full transverse coherence .",
    "this assumption allow us to assume that the input shot noise signal is defined by the value of total beam current . in reality",
    "the fluctuations of the electron beam current density are uncorrelated in the transverse dimension . using the notion of the beam radiated modes",
    ", we can say that many transverse radiation modes are radiated when the electron beam enters the undulator .",
    "the one - dimensional model can be used for the calculations of statistical properties of transversely coherent output current . in practice",
    "such an assumption is valid for the current at the exit of klystron with a thin electron beam . during the amplification process in a klystron , the number of transverse modes decreases , and the contribution of the coherent radiation to the total radiation power",
    "is increased up to full coherence . with this assumption",
    ", attention can be concentrated completely on temporal coherence effects .",
    "we study the case when the initial modulation of the electron beam is defined by the shot noise and has a white spectrum .",
    "since in the linear regime all the harmonics are amplified independently , we can use the results of the steady - state theory for each harmonic and calculated the corresponding fourier harmonics of the output current .",
    "the electric current in the time domain , @xmath394 , and its fourier transform , @xmath395 , are connected    @xmath396    the klystron amplifier has a response which can be economically expressed as a frequency response curve @xmath397 .",
    "thus , the fourier harmonic of the current at the dispersion section exit and the fourier harmonic of the input current are connected by the relation :    @xmath398    when @xmath399 the fourier harmonic is defined by the relation @xmath400 .",
    "it is convenient to isolate explicitly the slowly varying complex amplitude    @xmath401    where    @xmath402    the real output current consists of a carrier modulation of frequency @xmath367 subjected to random amplitude and phase modulation .",
    "the fourier decomposition of the output current contains frequencies spread about @xmath367 .",
    "it is not possible in practice to resolve the oscillations in @xmath394 that occur at frequency of the carrier modulation .",
    "a good experimental resolving time is of order of picoseconds , at least four orders of magnitude too long to detect oscillations at the frequency @xmath367 .",
    "it is therefore appropriate for comparison with experiment to average the theoretical results over a cycle of oscillation of the carrier modulation .",
    "the deviation @xmath403 has a zero cycle - average . according to ( [ eq : sn1 ] ) ,",
    "the cycle average of the square of the current deviation is    @xmath404    shot noise is a random statistical process and statements about shot noise are probability statements .",
    "these are most easily handled using the concept of a statistical ensemble , drawn from statistical mechanics .",
    "if the physical construction of the injector and set of the external parameters ( e.g supply voltage , photoinjector laser beam parameters ) which specify its state are known , then these parameters define a definite statistical ensemble to which the injector belongs.this ensemble consists of identical copies of the injector subject to identical macroscopic external conditions .",
    "any external property of the injector , e.g. its laser light on the photosurface , will depend , however , not only on these given parameters but also on the exact microscopic internal state of the photocathode , and each copy of the injector in the ensemble will lead to a different output .",
    "we shall always denote ensemble averages by @xmath405 . in practice",
    "the xfel injector is required to produce a single electron bunch at a repetition rate of 100 - 100 000 bunch / s and averaging symbol @xmath405 simply means the ensemble average over electron bunches .",
    "the output fluctuations , expressed as current fluctuations , have a mean square value    @xmath406    to calculate correlation of the spectral components of the output beam current , we should consider a microscopic picture of the electron beam current at the undulator entrance .",

    "the long ( unbunched ) electron pulse is one of the advantages of the adopted fel design .",
    "since the electron pulse duration ( about 10 ps ) is much longer than the time jitter of the electron and seed laser pulses @xmath481 , the synchronization of the optical laser with the electron pulses is not a problem .",
    "pump - probe techniques which are commonly used with optical lasers , are highly desirable in order to make full use of the femtosecond soft x - ray pulses . since , in this case , precise timing is needed with a jitter of less than 10 fs , in @xcite we suggested to combine the femtosecond soft x - ray pulses generated by the sideband - seeded sase fel with optical pulses generated by the seed laser system .",
    "it should be emphasized that in the proposed scheme a femtosecond soft x - ray pulse is naturally synchronized with his femtosecond optical pulse and cancels jitter .",
    "this development of xfel based pump - probe experiments allow us to investigate phenomena at timescale down to 100 fs .",
    "an x - ray laboratory should serve several , may be up to ten experimental stations which can be operated independently according to the needs of the user community .",
    "on the other hand , the multi - user distribution system has to satisfy an additional requirement . passing the electron bunch through the bending magnets",
    "must avoid emittance dilution due to coherent synchrotron radiation ( csr ) effects .",
    "for very short bunches and very high peak current , csr can generated energy spread in the bending magnets and thus dilute the horizontal emittance .",
    "as a result , the prefered layout of a conventional sase fel is a linear arrangement in which the injector , accelerator , bunch compressors and undulators are nearly collinear , and in which the electron beam does not change direction between accelerator and undulators .",
    "the situation is quite different for the klystron amplifier scheme proposed in our paper .",
    "since it operates without bunch compression in the injector linac , the problem of emittance dilution in the bending magnets does not exist .",
    "an electron beam distribution system based on unbunched electron beam can provide efficient ways to generate a multi - user facility - very similar to present day synchrotron radiation facilities .",
    "a possible layout of a soft x - ray fel laboratory based on an electron ring distribution system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : a4gf ] .",
    "the layout of the laboratory follows a similar approach as that used for synchrotron light sources .",
    "the sase fel user facility consists of an injector linac and electron beam distribution system .",
    "the injector is composed of a rf gun with photocathode and a main ( superconducting ) linac . in order to make efficient use of the new source",
    "it is proposed to segment the full circumference of a distribution system into arcs which are repeated a number of times to form a complete ring .",
    "each cell includes a two - cascade klystron and a bending magnet .",
    "a specific realization of the electron ring cell is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : acu ] .",
    "the electron beam transport line guiding electrons from the injector linac to the experimental hall is connected tangentially to one of the straight sections of the electron ring . in order to obtain a useful separation between the experimental areas behind the photon beam lines ,",
    "an angle of 36 degrees between two neighboring lines would be desirable .",
    "thus , ten beam lines can be installed on a complete electron ring .",
    "using klystron ( electromagnetic ) dispersion sections in each cell as switching elements it is possible to quickly switch the fel photon beam from one experiment to the other , thus providing multi - user capability .",
    "users can define the radiation wavelength for their experiment independently of each other to a very large extent , since they use different undulators .",
    "injector linac and electron beam transport lines operate at fixed parameters . at a fixed electron energy",
    "the magnet gap of the klystron undulators can be varied mechanically for wavelength tuning .",
    "this design makes it possible to make various wavelengths of sase radiation available in the xfel laboratory quasi - simultaneously .",
    "it is a great advantage that injector and electron beam transport lines in the new scheme of multi - user facility operate at fixed parameters and that an `` electron switchard '' is not required .",
    "when a relativistic electron beam passes through the undulator , it emits incoherent radiation .",
    "this process leads to an increase of the energy spread in the beam due to quantum fluctuations of the undulator radiation .",
    "this effect grows significantly with an increase in electron beam energy , strength field and length of the undulator .",
    "this effect should be carefully taken into account when designing multi - user distribution system .",
    "for the case of planar undulator the expression for the rate of energy diffusion can be written in the following form@xcite :    @xmath482    where @xmath483 is the compton wavelength , @xmath484 is the classical electron radius , @xmath485 for @xmath486 .",
    "the next numerical example illustrates the amplitude of the effect .",
    "if @xmath339 , @xmath338 , @xmath487 , and the total undulator length is equal to 100 m , appropriate substitution in ( [ eq : cfz ] ) shows that the energy spread increase due to quantum fluctuations is about @xmath488 at the end of the 10th klystron amplifier , and has a negligible effect on the klystron performance .",
    "the high - gain klystron amplifier described in this paper is an attractive alternative to other fel configurations for operation in short wavelength range .",
    "an distinguishing feature of the klystron amplifier is the absence of apparent limitations which would prevent operation without bunch compression in the injector linac .",
    "we have illustrated the proposed cascade klystron scheme using the parameters of the tesla test facility .",
    "although the present work is concerned primarily for use in the soft x - ray spectrum , its applicability is not restricted to that range , for example an x - ray sase fel is a suitable candidate for application of cascade klystron scheme described here .",
