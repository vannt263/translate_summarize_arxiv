    "defect - free crystals are macroscopic quantum systems with spatial periodicity .",
    "this is attested by electronic states and , for nuclei , by discrete phonon spectra observed at any temperature below melting or decomposition .",
    "however , the quantum nature of nuclei is overlooked in many cases .",
    "for example , in crystals containing o ",
    "h@xmath3o hydrogen bonds , when the coexistence of two configurations for protons , say @xmath4 and @xmath5 , is conceived of as `` disorder '' of particles with definite positions and momenta .",
    "this is at variance with vibrational spectra showing that the translational invariance of the lattice and the quantum nature of dynamics are not destroyed , even on the short time scale of proton dynamics ( @xmath6 s ) .",
    "such crystals should be therefore represented by macroscopic states for nonlocal observables .",
    "this conflict between disorder and macroscopic states parallels the dichotomy of interpretation of quantum mechanics applied to macroscopic systems @xcite . at the microscopic level ,",
    "a quantum superposition indicates a lack of definiteness of outcome evidenced by interferences .",
    "extrapolated to the macroscopic level of everyday life , this leads to schrdinger s cat in a superposition of @xmath7 and @xmath8 states .",
    "however , we know that a cat is either dead or alive , so we are naturally inclined to think that a macroscopic object which has available to it two or more macroscopically distinct states is in one of these states for each measurement of the ensemble @xcite . for hydrogen bond protons , this means that dynamics at the microscopic level of a double - well are quantum in nature ( tunnelling ) , whereas at the macroscopic level of a crystal , protons which have available to them distinct sites are in one of the many possible configurations for each measurement .    for open systems ,",
    "this dichotomy of interpretation can be legitimated by decoherence stipulating that an initial superposition state should lose its ability to exhibit quantum interferences via interaction with the environment @xcite . however , since the quantum theory does not predict any dividing line between quantal and classical regimes , macroscopic quantum behaviour is possible for systems decoupled from , or very weakly coupled to , the surroundings @xcite . in principle , there is no upper limit in size , complexity , and temperature , beyond which such systems should be doomed to classicality .",
    "the crystal of potassium hydrogen carbonate ( khco@xmath2 ) is a counterexample to the dichotomy of interpretation of quantum mechanics at the macroscopic level .",
    "neutron diffraction and vibrational spectroscopy provide positive evidences of macroscopic superposition states for protons featuring quantum correlations , at the scale of avogadro s constant , and about room temperature @xcite .",
    "the particle - like representation of protons possessing properties in their own right ( position , momentum , spin ) must be abandoned .",
    "nonlocal observables and macroscopic wave functions are best appropriate to the translation invariant symmetry of the crystal .",
    "these states are decoherence - free and there is no transition to the classical regime , as long as the crystal structure is not disrupted .",
    "the question at issue in the present paper is as to whether or not macroscopic states are destroyed by static disorder in a mixed crystal , kh@xmath9d@xmath10co@xmath2 , as grown from a water solution containing h@xmath11o , hdo , d@xmath11o molecules . in this crystal ,",
    "h and d nuclei are not mobile and there is no segregation into separate domains .",
    "our purpose is to determine with neutron diffraction the impact of static disorder to the crystal symmetry .",
    "we are not aware of such measurements ever published for this system .    in section [ sec:2 ] , we report neutron diffraction measurements showing that the crystal of kh@xmath0d@xmath1co@xmath2 is isomorphous with khco@xmath2 and kdco@xmath2 .",
    "this is at variance with static disorder .",
    "data are best fitted with distinct h and d sublattices .",
    "we propose , in section [ sec:3 ] , a theoretical framework for superposed proton and deuteron states .",
    "up to room temperature , these monoclinic crystals are isomorphous : space group @xmath12 ( c@xmath13 ) with four equivalent khco@xmath2 or kdco@xmath2 entities per unit cell ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) @xcite .",
    "they are made up of centrosymmetric dimers ( hco@xmath14 or ( dco@xmath14 linked by moderately strong hydrogen ( deuterium ) bonds , with lengths @xmath15   ( @xmath16  ) .",
    "dimers lie practically in ( 103 ) planes and hydrogen ( deuterium ) bonds are virtually parallel to each other .",
    "these crystals are uniquely suited to probing dynamics along directions @xmath17 parallel to the stretching ( @xmath18oh/@xmath18od ) , the in - plane bending ( @xmath19oh/@xmath19od ) , and the out - of - plane bending ( @xmath20oh/@xmath20od ) vibrations , respectively .    from 14 k to 300 k , there is no structural phase transition for either crystal .",
    "the increase of the unit cell dimensions and of @xmath21 or @xmath22 are marginal , while the populations of proton ( deuteron ) sites change significantly .",
    "below @xmath23 k , only those sites corresponding to a unique configuration for dimers ( say @xmath24 , see arrows in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) are occupied . at elevated temperatures ,",
    "less favored @xmath25 sites , at @xmath26   from the @xmath24 ones , are progressively populated .",
    "the space group symmetry and quantum correlations are unaffected .",
    "this accords with a superposition of macroscopically distinct @xmath27 and @xmath28 states corresponding to the @xmath12 configurations sketched in fig .",

    "we utilized the four - circle diffractometer 5c2 based at the orphe reactor ( laboratoire lon - brillouin ) @xcite .",

    "positional and anisotropic thermal parameters for each sublattice , isotope concentrations ( @xmath44 ) and occupancies ( @xmath45 @xmath46 @xmath47 @xmath48 ) were allowed to vary independently from each other .    in tables",

    "small differences for proton positions are insignificant compared to the thermal ellipsoids .    in the isotope mixture , positional and thermal parameters of protons and deuterons at the same sites",
    "are identical , so fig . [ fig:1 ] is representative of the structure with a superposition of indiscernible h and d sublattices . in table",
    "[ tab:2 ] , the estimated concentrations , @xmath49 and @xmath50 accord with those of the initial water solution and the sum @xmath51 is self - consistent .",
    "the occupancy @xmath52 could be slightly smaller than 0.22(1 ) for khco@xmath2 , while @xmath53 could be a little bit greater than 0.12(1 ) for kdco@xmath2 @xcite . a small variation of the effective energy difference between @xmath24 and @xmath25 configurations with the isotope content can not be excluded , but statistical errors are not conclusive . finally , the o@xmath3o bond length of 2.587(1 )   is equal to @xmath54 .",
    "the lattice of heavy atoms could be also made up of separate sublattices , but we did not pursue this option .    for the sake of completeness , we tried an alternative model supposing that h and d nuclei merge into hybrid entities [ h@xmath29d@xmath10 ] with the averaged scattering length @xmath56 .",
    "these hybrids were incorporated in sublattices [ h@xmath29d@xmath10]@xmath39 and [ h@xmath29d@xmath10]@xmath40 as : @xmath57 ( \\rho_{l},\\rho_{r } ) = \\rho_{l}[\\mathrm{h}_p\\mathrm{d}_{1-p}]_{l } + \\rho_{r}[\\mathrm{h}_p\\mathrm{d}_{1-p}]_{r}.\\ ] ] in this model the isotope concentration @xmath58 is not a free parameter .",

    "when @xmath61 and @xmath62 , as well as positional and thermal parameters for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 sublattices , were allowed to vary independently , the refinement did not converge to any stable structure .",
    "we imposed further constraints by setting equal thermal parameters for @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "then , refinement of the remaining 56 free parameters did converge to a stable structure ( r = 0.036 ) , roughly similar to the previous one .",
    "therefore , this model is not formally excluded by bragg diffraction . in the next section ,",
    "we present theoretical arguments liable to discriminate models ( [ eq:1 ] ) and ( [ eq:2 ] ) .",
    "the theoretical framework is a follow up of that presented in refs @xcite .",
    "we begin with macroscopic states in pure crystals and then we consider isotope mixtures .      within the framework of the born - oppenheimer approximation , the nuclear hamiltonian can be partitioned as @xmath63 where @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 represent the sublattices of h@xmath67 , d@xmath67 and heavy atoms , respectively .",
    "@xmath68 is the coupling term between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , while @xmath69 couples the three subsystems .",
    "vibrational spectra show that h and d states are separable , so @xmath68 can be ignored .",
    "the `` hybrid '' model ( [ eq:2 ] ) leading to an effective oscillator mass @xmath70 and a continuous frequency shift with @xmath58 is therefore inappropriate .    for oho or odo bonds , coupling terms between o@xmath3o and h or d degrees of freedom",
    "are rather large @xcite , hence beyond the framework of the perturbation theory .",
    "yet , quantum dynamics can be rationalized within the framework of the adiabatic separation of @xmath64 and @xmath65 , on the one hand , and @xmath66 , on the other @xcite .",
    "the observation of separable h and d states is an evidence of the adiabatic separation from heavy atoms .",
    "then , bare protons are fermions while bare deuterons are bosons .      consider a crystal made of @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) unit cells labelled @xmath75 along crystal axes @xmath76",
    "@xmath77 @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "the two dimers per unit cell are indexed as @xmath79 and @xmath80 , respectively , with @xmath81 . for centrosymmetric dimers , there is no permanent dipolar interaction , so interdimer coupling terms are negligible @xcite .",
    "the eigen states of the sublattices of protons or deuterons can be therefore represented with eigen states for isolated dimers    a dimer ( h1,h2 ) or ( d1,d2 ) is modelled with coupled centrosymmetric collinear oscillators in three dimensions , along coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath83 ( @xmath84 ) .",
    "the center of symmetry is at @xmath85 . within the framework of the harmonic approximation",
    ", the mass - conserving symmetry coordinates independent of @xmath86 and their conjugated momenta , @xmath87 lead to uncoupled oscillators at frequencies @xmath88 and @xmath89 , respectively .",

    "the wave functions , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , can not be factored into wave functions for individual particles , so there is no local information available for these entangled oscillators .",
    "then , the wave functions for protons or deuterons are subjected to the symmetrization postulate of quantum mechanics in different ways @xcite .",
    "as the wave functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 are unaffected by permutation changing the signs of @xmath85 , they are appropriate for bosons , but not for fermions .      in order to antisymmetrize the degenerate ground state with respect to permutation , the wave functions are rewritten as linear combinations @xmath94\\ ] ] and the state vectors with singlet - like @xmath95 or triplet - like @xmath96 spin symmetry are : @xmath97 the oscillators are now entangled in position , momentum , and spin . as there is no level splitting , entanglement is energy - free and independent of @xmath91 .",
    "the spatial periodicity of the sublattice leads to collective dynamics and nonlocal observables in three dimensions . with the vibrational wave function for the unit cell @xmath98 namely @xmath99 , where @xmath100 `` @xmath101 '' or `` @xmath102 '' for singlet - like or triplet - like symmetry , respectively , we write phonon waves as @xmath103 where @xmath104 is the wave vector , @xmath105 is the lattice vector , @xmath106 , @xmath107 , @xmath108 , are the unit cell vectors",
    "then , antisymmetrization leads to @xmath109 this means that there is no phonon ( no elastic distortion ) in the ground state ( `` super - rigidity '' ) @xcite .",
    "the lattice state vectors @xmath110 are superposed in the ground state as : @xmath111 these states are intrinsically steady against decoherence .",
    "the main source of disentanglement is the thermal bath but , even at room temperature , the population of the first excited state ( @xmath112 for @xmath20oh @xmath113 @xmath114 ) is negligible .      for bosons ,",
    "the wave functions for a dimer @xmath115 are symmetric with respect to particle permutation .",
    "as there is no significant spin - spin coupling compared to the thermal bath , the spin of a pair is statistically zero , so there is no correlation at all .",
    "phonon states can be written as @xmath116 .",
    "in contrast to the fermion case , there is no super - rigidity .",
    "needless to say , the h and d sublattices have the same number of degrees of freedom ( 12 per unit cell ) , but the symmetrization postulate shrinks the size of the allowed hilbert space from @xmath117 for bosons to @xmath118 for fermions .",
    "the sublattice at room temperature can be represented with a superposition of separable proton and deuteron states , each of them being a superposition of @xmath24 and @xmath25 states , as :    @xmath119 + p_d^{1/2 } [ \\rho_{ld}^{1/2}|\\mathrm{d}_{\\mathbf{k}l\\pm}\\rangle_l + \\rho_{rd}^{1/2 } |\\mathrm{d}_{\\mathbf{k}r\\pm}\\rangle_r];\\ ] ]      neutrons ( spin @xmath120 ) are unique to probing the spin - symmetry of proton states ( [ eq:9 ] ) .",
    "however , the spin entanglement is extremely fragile , so only `` noninvasive '' experiments , free of measurement - induced decoherence , are appropriate @xcite .",

    "the spin - symmetry is destroyed , the super - rigidity is lost , and the final proton states @xmath125 are analogous to boson states ( [ eq:12 ] ) . the structural model ( [ eq:1 ] ) is therefore consistent with diffraction by an initial superposition state ( [ eq:13 ] ) and one of the final states @xmath126 @xmath127 @xmath128 @xmath129 . the final state of a particular event is unknown because the four states are degenerate in reciprocal space .",
