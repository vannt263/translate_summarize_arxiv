    "ginibre ( @xcite ) introduced the basic non - hermitian ensembles of random matrix theory .",
    "these are @xmath0 matrices @xmath2 comprised of independent ( and standardized ) real , complex or quaternion gaussian entries and are clear analogues of the gaussian orthogonal , unitary and symplectic ensembles @xmath3 .",
    "the results of @xcite include explicit formulas for the joint density of eigenvalues of @xmath2 , in both the complex and quaternion cases .",
    "the real - entried case posed serious technical hurdles , due largely to the fact that the real line itself receives positive mass in this setting , and the determination of the joint eigenvalue density remained open until @xcite , @xcite .",
    "these papers found conditional densities for the real ginibre ensemble eigenvalues , that is , formulas for the joint law given a predetermined number of real eigenvalues . even with these in hand",
    ", the expressions proved sufficiently complicated that the finite - dimensional correlation functions  the basic tool(s ) required to obtain limit theorems for local eigenvalue statistics  were only determined in the last few years . @xcite",
    "rigorously established that the eigenvalues of the real ginibre ensemble form a pfaffian point process : there are @xmath4 skew matrix kernels for the real / real , complex / complex and real / complex correlations from which the general @xmath5-point correlation is built as a @xmath6 pfaffian .",
    "these formulas along with the connected skew orthogonal polynomials discovered by @xcite allowed borodin  sinclair to derive the scaling limits for the kernels at both the ( real and complex ) bulk and the ( real and complex ) edge [ @xcite ] .",
    "[ we note that @xcite also presents the real / real and complex / complex correlations , as well as some asymptotics for the one and two - point functions .",
    "concurrently , @xcite reported the scaling limits of the kernels in the bulk . ]    here we are after a scaling limit for the spectral radius in the real ginibre ensemble . among other motivations ,",
    "this may be viewed as one possible refinement of the circular law .",
    "the latter refers to the fact that the normalized counting measure of the scaled eigenvalues converges ( weakly almost surely ) to the uniform measure on the unit disk .",
    "this result has a rather long history , starting with the work of @xcite which was made rigorous by @xcite , and culminating in the universality ( in terms of entry distributions ) theorems of @xcite and then @xcite . on a local scale ,",
    "considerable progress has been made on the universality of the @xmath7 bulk correlations ( even all the way up to the edge ) for both real and complex entries ; see @xcite ( @xcite ) , @xcite .",
    "our main result is the following :    [ mainthm ] denote by @xmath8 the spectral radius of the real ginibre ensemble , and set @xmath9 .",
    "then , as @xmath10 , @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the gumbel law with distribution function @xmath13",
    ".    one can certainly adjust the scaling so that the limiting distribution function takes the more standard form of @xmath14 .",
    "it is written this way for comparison : at the same scaling the limiting spectral radius in the complex ginibre ensemble is also gumbel , with distribution function @xmath14 .",
    "a similar result holds in the quaternion case .",
    "the universality of the limiting gumbel law for spectral radius in any setting ( real , complex , or quaternion ) has not been addressed .",
    "the analog of theorem [ mainthm ] for complex ginibre is a triviality .",
    "the eigenvalues of the complex ginibre ensemble form the canonical radially symmetric determinantal process on the complex plane , and it is the case that the moduli of the points of such a process are independent . stated in this generality this fact can be found in @xcite , chapter  7 , but had been observed earlier by @xcite specifically for complex ginibre . while a gumbel law is the only possible scaling limit for the extremal point , the precise scalings were worked out in @xcite where the author was unaware of kostlan s result , but rediscovered and used a  consequence thereof . in the quaternion case",
    "there is nothing like this determinantal trick .",
    "still the expectations of certain eigenvalue class functions factor nicely , which turns out to be enough ; see again @xcite .    for real ginibre",
    ", there appear to be no shortcuts toward pinning down the fluctuations of the spectral radius .",
    "instead we return to the standard random matrix theory machinery of tracing through the limiting fredholm determinant / pfaffian formulas for the related gap probabilities ( which are available once the correlation functions are known ) .",
    "the proof of theorem [ mainthm ] follows from determining the real and complex gaps separately :    [ compthm ] let @xmath15 be the eigenvalues of @xmath2 , then @xmath16 for any @xmath17 as @xmath1 , where again @xmath9 .    [ realthm ]",
    "introduce the integral operator @xmath18 with kernel @xmath19 let @xmath20 be the indicator of @xmath21 . then , as @xmath10 , @xmath22 where @xmath23 is built as follows .",
    "set @xmath24 , @xmath25 and denote by @xmath26 the kernel of the resolvent operator @xmath27 . then @xmath28 for @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "theorem [ mainthm ] then just recasts the result for complex points ; the largest real eigenvalue simply lives on a smaller scale .",
    "( obviously the largest negative real eigenvalue exhibits the same limit law . ) to make this explicit , we check here that the probability of the largest point in absolute value being real tends to zero . with that event denoted by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , @xmath33 for any large @xmath2 as @xmath7 . and by choice of @xmath2 , the lim(sup ) of the right - hand side can be made arbitrarily small by the outcomes of theorems [ compthm ] and [ realthm ] .",
    "note by definition the right - hand side of ( [ reallaw ] ) is a distribution function , and so tends to zero as @xmath34 , here @xmath2 , tends to infinity .",
    "this can also be seen directly from the simple fact that @xmath35 goes to zero in trace norm in the same parameter limit .",
    "from a technical standpoint the above means that we never have to consider the mixed real / complex correlations . the same calculation behind theorem [ compthm ] produces the full poisson point process surrounding the gumbel limit .",
    "since the complex eigenvalues occur in conjugate pairs and ( again ) the real eigenvalues are in sub - scaling the relevant statement is as follows .",
    "[ compcor ] rescale the eigenvalues @xmath36 lying in the ( strict ) upper half plane as in @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "the resulting point process converges , in the sense of finite - dimensional distributions , to the poisson random measure with intensity @xmath39 on @xmath40 .",
    "a convergence result along the lines of theorem [ realthm ] for the largest real point was presented in @xcite . there",
    "the right - hand side of ( [ reallaw ] ) was left in terms of the fredholm pfaffian of a @xmath41 matrix operator . here , besides rigorously establishing the appropriate norm convergence , the factorization in terms of scalar operators coincides with the initial form of @xmath42 tracy  widom ( @xmath43 ) distribution function as originally found for goe .",
    "indeed , the resulting structure of the above limit law is precisely the same as that form of @xmath43 : @xmath18 replaces the airy kernel , and the gaussian density @xmath44 plays the role of the airy function @xmath45 .",
    "unsurprisingly , our derivation of ( [ reallaw ] ) follows @xcite quite closely .",
    "one point of interest is that @xmath18 , like the airy or related bessel operator , is product hilbert ",
    "schmidt , and so trace class , on any positive half - line .",
    "( additional properties of @xmath18 are needed to show that the factors which make up @xmath23 are sensible . ) unlike the airy or bessel cases , however , @xmath18 does not posses a christoffel  darboux form and so is not integrable in the sense of @xcite , or at least not in this simple way .",
    "this presents at least one roadblock in obtaining a `` closed '' expression for ( [ reallaw ] ) , say something in terms of a single special function like the painlev formulation of the tracy ",
    "widom laws .",
    "even a characterizing pde or system of odes has eluded us .",
    "the full large deviations of ( [ reallaw ] ) are also open . the right tail , as @xmath46 ,",
    "is easily seen to have a gaussian shape ; this again was pointed out in @xcite .",
    "the determination of the left tail lies deeper and will be pursued in a later paper .",
    "this seems worthwhile given the separate interest in the limiting largest real point due to its applications in the stability analysis of certain biological systems [ @xcite ] .",
    "the next section recalls what is needed of the real ginibre correlation functions and gap probabilities .",
    "the limit laws for the largest complex and real points are derived separately in sections  [ sec3 ] and  [ sec4 ] .",
    "section  [ sec5 ] reports on some numerical simulations and discusses additional open questions .",
    "the results of @xcite lead to ( fredholm ) determinantal formulas for the relevant gap probabilities in the @xmath0 real ginibre ensemble @xmath2 .",
    "we state things in the particular form that we need .",
    "the probability @xmath47 of there being no complex eigenvalues of @xmath2 of modulus greater than @xmath48 is given by @xmath49 in which @xmath50 is a @xmath4 operator defined on @xmath51 , @xmath52 , cut down by the indicator function @xmath53 . in the standard notation , @xmath54\\ ] ] with the various operators defined most easily through their kernels @xmath55 @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",

    "that while @xcite considers only even values of @xmath60 ( @xmath61 there ) , the subsequent results of @xcite shows that the formulas remain unchanged for @xmath60 odd .",
    "this can be loosely understood by considering that any `` extra '' particle must be real .    for gaps on the real line",

    "while the first form of the @xmath74 kernel for @xmath60 odd may be more attractive , the second is better for asymptotics .",
    "both structures are also valid for , for instance , for odd @xmath60 goe . in particular , in the first form",
    "the correction term may be expressed as @xmath75 for @xmath76 the relevant skew - orthogonal polynomial and @xmath77 its normalizer ( see below ) , and the same holds for goe with appropriate substitutions for @xmath76 and @xmath77 .",
    "note that since the @xmath67 operator is not trace class , what is meant by the fredholm determinant of ( [ realk ] ) is at first not clear .",
    "however , this is a standard technicality in the world of @xmath42 ensembles , and how to mollify things or smooth out the @xmath67 is well understood ; see , for instance , @xcite , section  viii .",
    "proof of proposition  [ prop1 ] the @xmath60 even case is a restatement of @xcite , theorem  8 . the @xmath60 odd case was stated without proof in @xcite ( based on their derivation of the correlation functions of @xmath42 ensembles of odd order ) ; see also @xcite .",
    "we include the odd @xmath60 case here since the details of the derivation have not before appeared in the literature .",
    "we appeal to @xcite , section  7 ( providing yet another derivation of the correlation kernel for @xmath42 ensembles of odd order ) , using the particulars of ginibre s real ensemble .",
