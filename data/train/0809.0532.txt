    "hadron colliders , such as the tevatron at fermilab and the upcoming lhc at cern , produce large amounts of @xmath0 hadrons of all varieties , @xmath1 , @xmath2,@xmath3 and @xmath4 mesons , and @xmath5-flavored baryons .",
    "their numerous decay channels probe the flavor sector of the standard model ( sm ) and of any scenario conceived to go beyond it . of special interest",
    "are loop - induced processes and cp - violating observables , for example @xmath0-@xmath6 mixing , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 , which determine ckm angles or have sensitivity to new physics through virtual particles ( or both ) .",
    "a major challenge for theory is to disentangle the quark - level flavor physics from the qcd dynamics and to control the nonperturbative sector of qcd as far as possible .",
    "several tools are available for this task :    * perturbative calculations of inclusive rare decays ( @xmath12 ) based on the heavy - quark expansion .",
    "* @xmath13 , @xmath14 flavor symmetries based on the smallness of the light quark masses @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 . *",
    "factorization of hadronic two - body and exclusive rare fcnc decays based on the heavy - quark limit @xmath18 .",
    "* lattice - qcd computations , especially suited for `` static '' quantities ( decay constants @xmath19 , bag factors @xmath20 , @xmath21 form factors at small recoil ) @xcite . * qcd sum rules on the light cone ( lcsr ) , in particular for nonperturbative quantities with fast light hadrons ( distribution amplitudes @xmath22 , @xmath21 form factors at large recoil ) @xcite .",
    "these tools have been developped and refined over the years , a process that is still continuing .",
    "the methods are complementary and interdependent . for example , qcd sum rule or lattice results of hadronic form factors and decay constants are needed as input for factorization calculations , the latter in turn provide us with a framework to estimate @xmath14 breaking in amplitude relations based on flavor symmetries .    of central importance for flavor physics",
    "is the determination of the ckm unitarity triangle . the current status is shown in fig .  [ fig : ut ] .",
    "different determinations of the ckm parameters test the consistency of the sm and their precise values are needed as input for rare decays with sensitivity to new physics .",
    "theoretical studies are crucial to translate measurements into constraints on the unitarity triangle .",
    "an exceptionally clean quantity is @xmath23 , determined from cp violation in @xmath7 with negligible hadronic uncertainties .",
    "on the other hand , constraints from @xmath0-@xmath6 mixing ( @xmath24 ) require input from lattice qcd and the extraction of @xmath25 and @xmath26 benefits from progress in the theory of hadronic @xmath0-decays .",
    "we will focus on the latter topic , which has a wide range of applications both in two - body hadronic as well as in exclusive rare and radiative decays of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "the remainder of this talk is organized into the sections : theory of hadronic @xmath0 decays , phenomenology of @xmath27 , next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo ) calculations in qcd factorization , further highlights , and conclusions .",
    "a comprehensive discussion of @xmath0 , @xmath28 , and @xmath29 decays in the era of the lhc , covering both theoretical and experimental aspects , can be found in the recent review @xcite .",
    "we refer to this article for further details on the present discussion , for an account of new physics scenarios and their implications and for an extensive list of references .",
    "prospects for @xmath0 physics at the lhc are also treated in @xcite .",
    "to be specific we will discuss two - body hadronic @xmath0 decays , but the same theoretical methods also apply to rare and radiative processes such as @xmath10 or @xmath30 .",
    "the computation of the amplitude for the decay of a @xmath0 meson into a pair of light , charmless mesons , @xmath27 , starts from the effective weak hamiltonian at the scale @xmath31 @xcite @xmath32\\ ] ] @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) are ckm factors .",
    "the hamiltonian for @xmath35 transitions is obtained from the @xmath36 case by interchanging @xmath37 .",
    "the @xmath38 are wilson coefficients , which include the physics at large scales , @xmath39 , @xmath40 , or some new physics scale @xmath41 , down to the scale @xmath31 .",
    "they can be reliably computed in renormalization group ( rg ) improved perturbation theory and are routinely used at next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the @xmath42 are local operators of dimension 6 , for instance @xmath43 .",
    "the evaluation of their matrix elements @xmath44 is the essential problem in the theory of hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the matrix elements contain three relevant scales : @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 .",
    "because of the large hierarchy @xmath18 a systematic factorization of the corresponding contribution is possible , and the hard ( @xmath48 ) and hard - collinear ( @xmath49 ) parts may be treated in perturbation theory .",
    "the nonperturbative effects from scales @xmath50 can thus be separated from the perturbative ones and the computation simplifies considerably .",
    "while the effective hamiltonian in ( [ heff ] ) achieves a factorization of high - energy scales @xmath51 ( wilson coefficients ) from the @xmath45 scale contained in the matrix elements @xmath52 , the theory of the matrix elements in the heavy - quark limit extends the factorization of scales down to @xmath47 .",
    "the effective hamiltonian , together with the matrix elements of the operators @xmath42 , dictates the structure of the various @xmath0-decay amplitudes .",
    "for instance , in the important case of @xmath0 decays into a pair of light ( charmless ) mesons @xmath53 one has schematically @xmath54 this defines the tree and penguin amplitudes @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "their interplay , in conjunction with the magnitude and weak phase of the ckm factors determines the phenomnology of all charmless @xmath36 and @xmath35 transitions .      the factorization formula @xcite for matrix elements @xmath44 is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : fform ] .",
    "it holds to leading order in @xmath57 and to all orders in @xmath58 .",
    "the kernels @xmath59 , @xmath60 are determined by the hard scale @xmath45 ( @xmath59 ) and the hard - collinear scale @xmath61 ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "they are therefore calculable in perturbation theory .",
    "@xmath60 describes the hard spectator interactions and starts at order @xmath58 , whereas @xmath59 starts at order unity .",
    "the kernels @xmath62 are systematically separated ( factorized ) from the nonperturbative form factors @xmath63 and light - cone distribution amplitudes @xmath64 , @xmath65 .",
    "these hadronic quantities are universal properties of the mesons , or the @xmath66 transition .",
    "the factorization formula thus achieves a substantial simplification of the @xmath27 matrix elements , which can be systematically improved in perturbation theory .",
    "it is the basis for the theory of two - body hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "the factorization theorem can be formulated using soft - collinear effective theory ( scet ) @xcite .",
    "this formalism is useful for proving factorization and for disentangling the hard and hard - collinear scale in explicit terms .",
    "qcd factorization and scet are theoretical concepts that are fully consistent with each other , but they pertain to somewhat different aspects of the problem of @xmath0-decay matrix elements .",
    "qcd factorization @xcite refers to the separation of the matrix elements into simpler long - distance quantities and calculable hard interactions , while scet is a general effective field theory formulation for the relevant qcd modes ( hard , hard - collinear , collinear , soft ) in the problem . a somewhat analogous relation exists between the heavy - quark expansion ( hqe ) and heavy - quark effective theory ( hqet ) in their application to _ inclusive _ @xmath0 decays .",
    "it should be emphasized that in fact there is a single common theory of hadronic @xmath0 decays , which is based on factorization in the heavy - quark limit .",
    "this should not be confused with differences in the phenomenological implementation of the theory that exist in the literature .",
    "those concern , for example , the treatment of power corrections or the use of experimental input for certain quantities .",
    "a further variant of the basic idea of factorization is the so - called pqcd approach @xcite .",
    "it is more ambitious in the attempt to calculate further hadronic quantities such as form factors or annihilation graphs .",
    "this comes , however , at the expense of additional assumptions ( @xmath67 factorization , sudakov factors ) , which have been critizised in the literature @xcite .    a graphical representation of the various contributions to a matrix element @xmath44 within qcd factorization",
    "is given in figs .",
    "[ fig : lo]-[fig : hardspec ] .",
    "the leading order contribution is depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : lo ] , vertex and penguin - type nlo corrections to the kernel @xmath59 are shown in figs . [",
    "fig : vertex ] and [ fig : penguin ] , respectively , and the nlo ( @xmath68 ) contributions to the hard - spectator scattering kernel @xmath60 are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : hardspec ] .",
    "annihilation effects , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : annh ] , have a power suppression @xmath69 with respect to the contributions listed before .",
    "they are not calculable within the standard framework , but they may be estimated using model descriptions and should be part of the analysis of theory uncertainties .",
    "all two - body @xmath0 decays into light pseudoscalar ( @xmath56 ) and longitudinal vector mesons ( @xmath70 ) , which are fully calculable at leading power in qcd factorization , have been systematically analyzed at nlo in @xmath58 .",
    "the complete sets of decay modes @xmath71 @xcite , @xmath72 @xcite ( where @xmath73 is necessarily longitudinally polarized ) and @xmath74 @xcite are thus available in the literature .",
    "transverse polarization observables for @xmath75 modes are not entirely calculable in factorization .",
    "they have been discussed in @xcite .",
    "final states with vector and axial vector mesons were considered recently in @xcite .",
    "the multitude of decay channels is a big asset for the phenomenology of hadronic @xmath0 decays .",
    "first , symmetry relations can be used to reduce the dependence on hadronic physics .",
    "second , different modes are in general sensitive to different decay mechanisms and this may be exploited to selectively test the theoretical understanding of qcd in these processes . in order to illustrate this we show in table [ tab : ampl ] typical examples of decay modes that have a characteristic dependence on specific decay topologies .",
    ".amplitude topologies and flavor composition .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : cpvsc ]    for @xmath76 the measurements of babar and belle are not in very good agreement .",
    "babar finds @xmath77 , belle obtains @xmath78 .",
    "table [ tab : cpvsc ] quotes the average without inflating the error .",
    "the belle result appears somewhat large with respect to theory expectations , whereas the babar number is perfectly compatible .",
    "independent measurements at lhcb will be very important .",
    "up to an irrelevant constant factor the amplitude in ( [ amptp ] ) can , for @xmath79 , also be written as @xmath80 which defines magnitude @xmath81 and phase @xmath82 of the penguin - to - tree ratio .",
    "@xmath83 , @xmath84 are wolfenstein parameters and @xmath26 is a ckm phase .",
    "a similar expression holds for @xmath85 with the replacement of ( @xmath86 , @xmath87 ) by ( @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) .",
    "knowledge of @xmath90 and of the ckm angle @xmath91 or , equivalently , @xmath92 from cp violation in @xmath7 @xcite , fixes the unitarity triangle in the form @xcite",
    "@xmath93 @xmath94 up to the hadronic correction @xmath95 from the penguin - to - tree ratio the unitarity triangle is entirely determined by the observables @xmath90 and @xmath96 . from qcd",
    "factorization we have @xcite @xmath97    the analysis can be performed in the same way for the @xmath98 or the @xmath99 case .",
    "the results are compatible within errors . here",
    "we will concentrate on @xmath100 , which from a theoretical point of view appears slightly prefered because of a smaller size of the penguin amplitude and because all three @xmath101 decays are very well described within qcd factorization @xcite .",
    "also , for direct cp violation in @xmath102 the experimental situation is still not completely clarified , as mentioned above , whereas @xmath103 is measured to be small in agreement with theory expectations .",
    "for @xmath100 we have @xmath104 , which corresponds to a small phase , as confirmed empirically by the small direct cp violation @xmath103 . from the parameters @xmath105 , @xmath106 ,",
    "@xmath88 specified above we then obtain @xmath83 ( [ rhotau ] ) and @xmath84 ( [ etataus ] ) .",
    "this implies a value for @xmath107 , @xmath108 the uncertainty is still domianted by the experimental error in @xmath106 .",
    "the theoretical quantity @xmath88 may be cross - checked with the help of other measurements .",
    "the branching fraction for the pure penguin decay @xmath109 @xcite can be used to extract a penguin - to - tree ratio @xmath110 ( defined similarly as @xmath88 ) in agreement with qcd factorization . employing @xmath14 symmetry , @xmath111 can be obtained from @xmath112 @xcite .",
    "improved measurements of @xmath112 could help to further reduce the theory uncertainty in ( [ gammares ] ) .",
    "for several important classes of contributions in charmless two - body @xmath0 decays the perturbative calculations in qcd factorization have recently been extended to the level of nnlo corrections . by nnlo we here mean the effects of order @xmath113 . in many cases",
    "this level of accuracy is probably below the size of uncertainties from other sources , most notably from power corrections .",
    "however , the explicit knowledge of nnlo corrections is of some conceptual interest as it extends the factorization formula to the next nontrivial level in perturbation theory .",
    "in addition , there are quantities for which the nnlo effects are likely to be also numerically important . these are cases where a contribution is absent at @xmath114 and thus the @xmath68 term , a nlo contribution in the general counting scheme , is effectively the lowest order .",
    "an example is hard spectator scattering .",
    "another case is the coefficient of so - called color - suppressed amplitudes , @xmath115 , which is accidentally small at leading and next - to - leading order and therefore rather sensitive to nnlo effects .",
    "we briefly summarize the nnlo corrections that have been computed so far . these are , first , the @xmath116 , one - loop hard spectator interactions for current - current operators @xcite and for penguin contributions @xcite .",
    "the calculations in @xcite are done in the scet framework , whereas @xcite employs factorization in full qcd .",
    "the agreement of the results is an example of the equivalence of the two formulations .",
    "second , the two - loop vertex corrections ( @xmath59 ) have been addressed for the first time in @xcite , where the imaginary part is computed explicitly .",
    "the real part is still unpublished .",
    "the numerical impact of nnlo effects in comparison with other corrections for the coefficient @xmath117 , which dominates the amplitude for @xmath118 , is illustrated by the following compilation @xcite : @xmath119_{\\alpha_s}+[?-0.049 i]_{\\alpha^2_s } \\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{9 f_{m_1}f_b}{0.485\\ , m_b\\,\\lambda_b\\ , f^{b\\to m_1 } } \\left ( [ 0.122]_{\\alpha_s}+[0.050 + 0.053 i]_{\\alpha^2_s}+[0.071]_{\\rm twist-3 } \\right ) \\nonumber\\\\ & = & 0.275^{+0.228}_{-0.135}+\\left(-0.073^{+0.115}_{-0.082}\\right)i \\label{a2nnlo}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the first line lists the vertex corrections at various orders .",
    "the still unknown real part at order @xmath113 is indicated by the question mark .",
    "the second line shows the amplitude from hard spectator interactions .",
    "it includes an estimate of power corrections from twist-3 contributions to the light - cone wave function of the pion ( last term ) .",
    "the normalization of the prefactor is such that it gives unity for default values of the parameters .",
    "the third line displays the full result together with the total uncertainty .    in ( [ a2nnlo ] )",
    "the cancellation of leading and next - to - leading vertex contributions is clearly visible .",
    "this implies the dominance of the hard spectator term and the relativly large impact of nnlo effects and power corrections .",
    "in addition , the important parameter @xmath120 , which characterizes spectator scattering , is not well known .",
    "an accurate prediction of the @xmath118 branching ratio is therefore difficult .",
    "one may note that the nnlo term in the hard spectator interaction enhances the size of @xmath117 , bringing the theory prediction for @xmath121 closer to the relatively large experimental result .",
    "we briefly comment on some examples of further topics , which are of great interest for the tevatron and the lhc . a comprehensive account",
    "is contained in @xcite .      in the sm",
    "the branching fraction for the leptonic fcnc decay @xmath11 can be represented as @xmath122 ^ 2\\ ] ] the branching fraction is sensitive to the decay constant @xmath123 . apart from that it is completely dominated by short distance physics from top - quark loops and can be predicted with very good accuracy . in the sm",
    "the branching ratio is very small because of a helicity suppression .",
    "this leaves room for large enhancements from new physics , which are possible for instance in the minimal supersymmetric standard model with large @xmath124 , and could saturate the experimental bound .",
    "the current upper limit from cdf is @xcite @xmath125    since @xmath11 is theoretically very clean , has interesting sensitivity to new physics and a clear experimental signature , it is a prime goal for flavor studies at hadron colliders .",
    "rich possibilities to study short - distance flavor physics are also associated with the semileptonic rare decay @xmath126 . besides the differential branching ratio various other kinematical distributions may be measured in this decay .",
    "this would help to disentangle different sources of new physics .",
    "an interesting observable is , for example , the position of a zero in the forward - backward asymmetry @xmath127 as a function of the dilepton mass @xmath128 .",
    "@xmath127 is defined as the rate asymmetry between forward and backward going leptons @xmath129 in the dilepton center - of - mass frame .",
    "the position @xmath130 of the zero in @xmath131 has the form @xmath132 in the heavy - quark limit a scet relation ensures that unknown hadronic physics cancels in the ratio of form factors @xmath133 .",
    "this leads to a prediction of @xmath134 only in terms of calculable short - distance quantities ( @xmath135 ) .",
    "nlo qcd corrections have been computed in @xcite .      mixing and cp violation in the @xmath3-@xmath136 system",
    "can be investigated using decay asymmetries and distributions of the process @xmath137 . in some sense",
    "this decay is the analogue of @xmath138 in the @xmath2 system , but the vector - vector final state and the larger width difference @xmath139 in the @xmath3 case make the analysis of @xmath137 more involved @xcite .",
    "an analysis of recent measurements by cdf and d0 has been given in @xcite , suggesting indications for discrepancies with the sm .",
    "definite conclusions about the presence of new physics appear still premature .",
    "a further recent discussion of related topics can be found in @xcite .",
    "flavor studies with @xmath29 , @xmath28 and , in particular , @xmath0-meson decays complement direct searches for new physics at colliders .",
    "hadron machines deliver very large samples of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "their decay modes can be extracted from background if the final state is sufficiently clean , with charged tracks , typically few particles and one photon at most .",
    "in addition to improved measurements of known @xmath140 decay channels , the investigation of the rich and largely unexplored field of @xmath3 decays is of special importance . among the processes of interest",
    "are @xmath3-@xmath136 mixing , @xmath11 , the exclusive rare decays @xmath126 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath143 , and hadronic two - body modes such as @xmath102 , @xmath144 or @xmath9 . for the theoretical treatment of these decays and the control of hadronic physics",
    "it is necessary to use the systematic methods of factorization , scet , flavor symmetries , lattice qcd and light - cone sum rules , which are in many ways complementary to each other .",
    "presumably the most reliable results will be obtained when theory calculations enter only in small corrections to clean flavor observables . in these cases moderate precision in hadronic quantities will suffice to reach high accuracy in quantities of flavor physics . the large variety of @xmath0 decay channels will allow us to identify observables with this property or to construct them by a combination of several modes . with the available theoretical tools many opportunities exist at hadron colliders for precision tests and discoveries in @xmath0 physics .",
