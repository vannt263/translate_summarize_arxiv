    "<S> it is the hole kinetic energy that is responsible for the fact that the exciton is not the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> when the hole is bound to the electron in a zero momentum exciton , the momentum of the electron has to be compensated by an opposite momentum of the hole . because the low momentum electron states are pauli blocked , there is a minimal kinetic energy cost @xmath29 for the hole to form a bound state with the electron </S>",
    "<S> obviously , this cost vanishes in the limit where the hole becomes infinitely heavy @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> we then find that the exciton is stable for arbitrary density and corresponds to the bound state that always exists for an attractive potential in 2d .    when the exciton is metastable , the hole self energy ( [ eq : sigmahole ] ) is nonzero at the exciton energy . </S>",

    "<S> the relaxation of the hole by plasmon emission was considered in the plasmon - pole approximation @xcite . however </S>",
    "<S> , this relaxation channel does not contribute because it does not conserve energy and momentum .        </S>",
    "<S> unfortunately , the hole self energy ( [ eq : sigmahole ] ) diverges for all energies higher than @xmath32 ( ` the continuum ' ) so that we can not use our previous approach to include the hole self energy . </S>",
    "<S> a more sophisticated approach is necessary . as a first approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we follow schmitt - rink @xcite and obtain a first meaningful result by omitting the hole self energy altogether . actually above @xmath33 </S>",
    "<S> , the photon self energy acquires an imaginary part even when the hamiltonian ( [ eq : hx ] ) is real . </S>",
    "<S> physically , this finite lifetime comes from the conversion of photons into free electrons and holes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , as a lowest order approximation to the spectral function in this regime we calculate the spectral function exactly in the same way as before , summing up all ladder diagrams to infinite order , but the self energy for the hole is now discarded . </S>",
    "<S> the solution of the bse equation can now be calculated analytically to some extent @xcite but we implemented it straightforwardly numerically . for the exciton , we recover the ` excitonic enhancement ' @xcite , an increase in the absorption close to @xmath33 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig : mainfigure]c - e . </S>",
    "<S> it is an intriguing question whether this excitonic effect may lead to the formation of polaritons . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , this question was answered positively in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite where the observation of ` fermi edge polaritons ' was claimed .    to answer this question theoretically , we plot in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainfigure]b the photon spectral function when the cavity photon is in resonance with the fermi edge @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> different detunings are shown in the supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> several cuts at fixed electron densities , indicated with white dashed lines , are shown in the panels ( c - e ) . as expected , the lower polariton is pushed below the excitonic resonance . </S>",
    "<S> the shift of the polariton with respect to the exciton is however reduced due to the presence of the electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected since the light - matter coupling is proportional to the electron - hole overlap , which is reduced due to pauli blocking and screening . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , the linewidth of the polariton is strongly reduced with respect to the excitonic linewidth . </S>",
    "<S> this narrowing can be attributed to the reduced final state phase space that slows the hole relaxation . for low electron gas densities </S>",
    "<S> it is even possible for the polaritons to decrease their energy below the free electron - hole energy @xmath35 making their linewidth vanish ( on the figure a very small non - zero value is added to make the resonance visible ) . </S>",
    "<S> the linewidth reduction can be seen more clearly from the various cuts taken for different values of @xmath20 ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainfigure]c - e ) . </S>",
    "<S> qualitatively however the lower polariton is entirely similar to the one in the empty quantum well .    </S>",
    "<S> this is not the case for the upper polariton that can be clearly identified in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainfigure]b , above the absorption threshold . </S>",
    "<S> above @xmath33 bound states do no longer exist and one should think of the excitonic enhancement as the valence band hole interacting with all electrons in the fermi sea _ </S>",
    "<S> simultaneously_. nevertheless , this polaritonic resonance has a linewidth that is much smaller than the excitonic enhancement feature ( see insets of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainfigure]c - e ) . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it is shifted from the cavity resonance by @xmath36 @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> despite the two different approximations that were used to compute the spectral function below and above the absorption continuum ( red vertical line ) respectively , the matching of the curves is satisfactory .    </S>",
    "<S> it is conceptually interesting to elucidate the role of the final state interactions on this upper polariton . to this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we have turned off the final state coulomb interaction [ @xmath38 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : hx ] ) ] in our calculations . without fsi </S>",
    "<S> a much smaller energy shift from the cavity resonance is observed and a larger linewidth is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> it is really the final state coulomb interactions between the photo - excited electron - hole pair that pushes the quasi - particle above the cavity frequency . </S>",
    "<S> we have also checked that the ` rabi splitting ' vanishes when the cavity energy is blue detuned with respect to @xmath24 . </S>",
    "<S> it is indeed the fermi edge @xmath33 that is responsible for the formation of an upper polariton in the continuum , see supplemental material . </S>",
    "<S> finally , it is worth mentioning that when the light - matter coupling is increased , the upper polariton is further blue shifted and its linewidth increases . for a good visibility of the upper ` fermi edge ' polariton , it is actually advantageous if the rabi splitting is not too large ( not too many quantum wells ) . </S>",
    "<S> this trend is opposite to the one of the lower polariton , where a larger rabi splitting leads to a lower energy and therefore a longer lifetime .    </S>",
    "<S> note that the upper polariton energy decreases in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : mainfigure]b for increasing @xmath39 , even though the photon energy is constant and the exciton energy increases . in an undoped quantum well </S>",
    "<S> , the opposite dependence is observed for increasing exciton energy . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the decrease of the upper polariton energy to the reduction of the electron - hole overlap when the density is increased .    </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical results are in qualitative agreement with the experiments in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where at high doping density both an upper and lower polariton were observed . in this experimental work , a phenomenological explanation based on the fermi edge enhancement of the optical response was suggested . </S>",
    "<S> we have shown here that this enhancement is due to the usual excitonic bound state for the lower polariton , where it is of a different , collective nature for the upper polariton .    </S>",
    "<S> the discontinuity in the spectral function at @xmath33 is of course an artifact of our different approximations below and above this continuum energy . </S>",
    "<S> it should be cured by a consistent inclusion of the self energy below and above the absorption threshold energy . </S>",
    "<S> this self energy should actually contain the diagrams that are relevant for the physics of the mahan singularity so to capture the effect of this physics on the nature of the polaritons in doped quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> the present work is only a first step to such a complete description . </S>",
    "<S> it will also be of great interest to investigate the interactions between polaritons in doped quantum wells . </S>",
    "<S> it may be expected that interactions that are induced by excitations in the electron gas may enhance the polariton - polariton interactions with possible applications in quantum information processing .    </S>",
