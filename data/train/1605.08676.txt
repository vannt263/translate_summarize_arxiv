    "ultra cold dipolar gases , in which magnetic or electric dipole - dipole interactions  ( ddi ) play a crucial role , differ substantially from their non - dipolar counterparts .",
    "the long - range anisotropic nature of the ddi , and the interplay between ddi and short - range interactions , leads to rich new physics  @xcite , which is just starting to be unveiled in experiments on magnetic atoms  @xcite , polar molecules  @xcite , and rydberg - dressed atoms  @xcite .",
    "since the ddi are partially attractive , dipolar gases may undergo instability unless the ddi are properly compensated by the contact interaction .",
    "chromium experiments showed that , as in non - dipolar bose - einstein condensates  ( becs ) with negative @xmath0-wave scattering length , @xmath1 , an unstable dipolar bec collapses when the scattering length is quenched below a critical value  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , recent dysprosium experiments  @xcite have revealed that destabilization of a dipolar bec does not generally lead to collapse , as previously assumed . in these breakthrough experiments destabilization leads to the formation of stable droplets , that are only destroyed in a long time scale by three - body losses .",
    "although first studies pointed to the possibility that large three - body conservative forces could stabilize the droplets  @xcite , recent works have shown that the most plausible stabilization mechanism is due to quantum fluctuations  @xcite , which play a similar role as that of surface tension in classical ferrofluids  @xcite .    the stabilization mechanism , that stems from the corresponding lee - huang - yang  ( lhy ) correction of the condensate energy , results from the dipolar character of the condensate  @xcite .",
    "the anisotropic ddi result in hard  ( soft ) modes depending on whether the momentum of the excitation is quasi - parallel  ( perpendicular ) to the dipole moment . whereas long - wave length soft modes drive the bec instability at sufficiently low @xmath2 , hard modes dominate the repulsive lhy correction , resembling the situation recently studied in binary bose - bose mixtures  @xcite .",
    "when the bec becomes unstable , the local growth of the density @xmath3 associated to the modulational instability is eventually halted , since the repulsive lhy correction of the chemical potential scales as @xmath4 compared to the @xmath3 dependence of the mean - field term .",
    "crucially , this occurs despite a very small condensate depletion .",
    "the latter is possible since in the vicinity of the instability the mean - field term is very small due to the quasi - compensation of the ddi and contact interaction .",
    "quantum stabilization and the associated droplet nucleation are hence characteristic features of strongly dipolar becs , which were absent in chromium experiments only due to the relatively weak ddi  @xcite .",
    "this paper analyzes the ground - state properties and excitations of dipolar becs in the regime where lhy stabilization becomes relevant , both by means of numerical simulations of the corresponding generalized non - linear non - local schrdinger equation  ( gnlnlse ) , and by a gaussian ansatz approach .",
    "we first analyze the ground - state as a function of @xmath2 and the condensate aspect ratio , that , as for the case of three - body stabilization  @xcite , splits in three regimes : mean - field , droplet , and multi - stable , the latter occurring only for sufficiently pancake traps .",
    "we focus then in the regime without multi - stability region , in which the mean - field solution undergoes for decreasing @xmath2 a cross - over into the droplet regime .",
    "this crossover is marked by a characteristic growth of the peak density whose functional form differs from that expected for three - body stabilization . the lhy stabilization results in a three - dimensional  ( 3d ) self - bound  ( sb ) solution , which we characterize , discussing as well the conditions for its observability .",
    "finally , we characterize the collective excitations of the dipolar bec in the presence of lhy stabilization both for trapped becs and in the sb regime .    the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] introduces both the gnlnlse and the variational gaussian ansatz .",

    "<S> the ground - state phase diagram presents three main regimes : mean - field regime , in which the quantum correction is perturbative , droplet regime , in which quantum stabilization is crucial , and a multi - stable regime . in the absence of a multi - stable region , </S>",
    "<S> the condensate undergoes a crossover from the mean - field to the droplet solution marked by a characteristic growth of the peak density that may be employed to clearly distinguish quantum stabilization from other stabilization mechanisms . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly quantum stabilization allows for three - dimensionally self - bound condensates . </S>",
    "<S> we characterized these self - bound solutions , and discuss their realization in experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude with a discussion of the lowest - lying excitations both for trapped condensates , and for self - bound solutions . </S>"
