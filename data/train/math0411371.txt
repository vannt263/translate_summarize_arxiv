    "in the past twenty years there has been a great amount of interest in the theory of wavelets , motivated by applications to various fields such as signal processing , data compression , tomography , and subdivision algorithms for graphics ( our latest check on the word `` wavelet '' in google turned up over one million and a half results , 1,590,000 to be exact ) .",
    "it is enough here to mention two outstanding successes of the theory : jpeg 2000 , the new standard in image compression , and the wsq ( wavelet scalar quantization ) method which is used now by the fbi to store its fingerprint database . as a mathematical subject",
    ", wavelet theory has found points of interaction with functional and harmonic analysis , operator theory , ergodic theory and probability , numerical analysis and differential equations . with the explosion of information due to the expansion of the internet ,",
    "there came a need for faster algorithms and better compression rates .",
    "these have motivated the research for new examples of wavelets and new wavelet theories .",
    "recent developments in wavelet analysis have brought together ideas from engineering , from computational mathematics , as well as fundamentals from representation theory .",
    "this paper has two aims : one to stress the interconnections , as opposed to one aspect of this in isolation ; and secondly to show that the fundamental hilbert space ideas from the linear theory in fact adapt to a quite wide class of nonlinear problems .",
    "this class includes random - walk models based on martingales . as we show , the theory is flexible enough to allow the adaptation of pyramid algorithms to computations in the dynamics of substitution theory as it is used in discrete dynamics ; e.g. , the complex dynamics of julia sets , and of substitution dynamics .",
    "our subject draws on ideas from a variety of directions . of these directions , we single out quadrature - mirror filters from signal / image processing .",
    "high - pass / low - pass signal processing algorithms have now been adopted by pure mathematicians , although they historically first were intended for speech signals , see @xcite . perhaps unexpectedly ,",
    "essentially the same quadrature relations were rediscovered in operator - algebra theory , and they are now used in relatively painless constructions of varieties of wavelet bases .",
    "the connection to signal processing is rarely stressed in the math literature . yet , the flow of ideas between signal processing and wavelet math is a success story that deserves to be told .",
    "thus , mathematicians have borrowed from engineers ; and the engineers may be happy to know that what they do is used in mathematics .",
    "our presentation serves simultaneously to motivate and to survey a number of recent results in this general area .",
    "hence we leave out some proofs , but instead we add a number of intuitive ideas which we hope will make the subject more accessible to researchers in operator theory and systems theory .",
    "our theorems with full proofs will appear elsewhere .",
    "an independent aim of our paper is to point out several new and open problems in nonlinear dynamics which could likely be attacked with the general multiscale methods that are the focus of our paper .    in section [ s2 ] below , we present background material from signal processing and from wavelets in a form which we hope will be accessible to operator theorists , and to researchers in systems theory .",
    "this is followed in section [ exa ] by a presentation of some motivating examples from nonlinear dynamics .",
    "they are presented such as to allow the construction of appropriate hilbert spaces which encode the multiscale structure . starting with a state space @xmath0 from dynamics , our main tool in the construction of a multiscale hilbert space",
    "@xmath1 is the theory of random walk and martingales .",
    "the main part of our paper , sections [ propro ] and [ other ] , serves to present our recent new and joint results .",
    "we will use the term `` filter '' in the sense of signal processing . in the simplest case , time is discrete , and a signal is just a numerical sequence .",
    "we may be acting on a space of signals ( sequences ) using the operation of cauchy product ; and the operations of down - sampling and up - sampling .",
    "this viewpoint is standard in the engineering literature , and is reviewed in @xcite ( see also @xcite and @xcite ) for the benefit of mathematicians .",
    "a numerical sequence @xmath2 represents a filter , but it is convenient , at the same time , also to work with the frequency - response function . by this",
    "we mean simply the fourier series ( see ( [ eqlowpass ] ) below ) corresponding to the sequence @xmath2 .",
    "this fourier series is called the filter function , and in one variable we view it as a function on the one - torus .",
    "( this is using the usual identification of periodic functions on the line with functions on the torus . )",
    "the advantage of this dual approach is that cauchy product of sequences then becomes pointwise product of functions .",
    "we will have occasion to also work with several dimensions @xmath3 , and then our filter function represents a function on the @xmath3-torus . while signal processing algorithms are old , their use in wavelets is of more recent vintage . from the theory of wavelets , we learn that filters are used in the first step of a wavelet construction , the so - called multiresolution approach . in this approach ,",
    "the problem is to construct a function on @xmath4 or on @xmath5 which satisfies a certain renormalization identity , called the scaling equation , and we recall this equation in two versions ( [ eqscaling0 ] ) and ( [ eqscaling ] ) below . the numbers @xmath2 entering into the scaling equation turn out to be the very same numbers the signal processing engineers discovered as _ quadrature - mirror filters_.    a class of wavelet bases are determined by filter functions .",
    "we establish a duality structure for the category of filter functions and classes of representations of a certain @xmath6-algebra . in the process , we find new representations , and we prove a correspondence which serves as a computational device .",
    "computations are done in the sequence space @xmath7 , while wavelet functions are in the hilbert space @xmath8 , or some other space of functions on a continuum .",
    "the trick is that we choose a subspace of @xmath8 in which computations are done .",
    "the choice of subspace is dictated by practical issues such as resolution in an image , or refinement of frequency bands .",
    "we consider non - abelian algebras containing canonical maximal abelian subalgebras , i.e. , @xmath9 where @xmath0 is the gelfand space , and the representations define measures @xmath10 on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , in the examples we study , it turns out that @xmath0 is an affine iterated function system ( ifs ) , of course depending on the representation . in the standard wavelet case",
    ", @xmath0 may be taken to be the unit interval .",
    "following wickerhauser et al .",
    "@xcite , these measures @xmath10 are used in the characterization and analysis of wavelet packets .",
    "orthogonal wavelets , or wavelet frames , for @xmath11 are associated with quadrature - mirror filters ( qmf ) , a set of complex numbers which relate the dyadic scaling of functions on @xmath12 to the @xmath13-translates . in the paper @xcite ,",
    "we show that generically , the data in the qmf - systems of wavelets are minimal , in the sense that it can not be nontrivially reduced . the minimality property is given a geometric formulation in @xmath14 ; and it is then shown that minimality corresponds to irreducibility of a wavelet representation of the cuntz algebra @xmath15 .",
    "our result is that this family of representations of @xmath15 on @xmath16 is irreducible for a generic set of values of the parameters which label the wavelet representations . since mra - wavelets correspond to representations of the cuntz algebras @xmath15",
    ", we then get , as a bonus , results about these representations .",
    "( ruelle s operators . )",
    "let @xmath17 be a finite borel measure space , and let @xmath18 be a finite - to - one mapping of @xmath0 onto itself .",
    "( the measure @xmath10 will be introduced in section [ propro ] below , and it will be designed so as to have a certain strong invariance property which generalizes the familiar property of haar measure in the context of compact groups . ) let @xmath19 be a given measurable function .",
    "we then define an associated operator @xmath20 , depending on both @xmath21 and the endomorphism @xmath22 , by the following formula @xmath23 each of the operators @xmath24 will be referred to as a ruelle operator , or a transition operator ; and each @xmath24 clearly maps positive functions to positive functions .",
    "( when we say `` positive '' we do not mean `` strictly positive '' , but merely `` non - negative '' . )",
    "we refer to our published papers / monographs @xcite about the spectral picture of a positive transition operator @xmath25 ( also called the ruelle operator , or the perron  frobenius ",
    "ruelle operator ) .",
    "continuing @xcite , it is shown in @xcite that a general family of hilbert - space constructions , which includes the context of wavelets , may be understood from the so - called perron ",
    "frobenius eigenspace of @xmath25 .",
    "this eigenspace is studied further in the book @xcite by jorgensen and o.  bratteli ; see also @xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that a _ scaling identity _ ( alias _ refinement equation _ ) @xmath26 may be viewed generally and abstractly",
    ". variations of ( [ eqscaling0 ] ) open up for a variety of new applications which we outline briefly below .",
    "in this paper we outline how basic operator - theoretic notions from wavelet theory ( such as the succesful multiresolution construction ) may be adapted to certain state spaces in nonlinear dynamics . we will survey and extend our recent papers on multiresolution analysis of state spaces in symbolic shift dynamics @xmath27 , and on a class of substitution systems @xmath28 which includes the julia sets ; see , e.g. , our papers @xcite .",
    "our analysis of these systems @xmath0 starts with consideration of hilbert spaces of functions on @xmath0 .",
    "but already this point demands new tools .",
    "so the first step in our work amounts to building the right hilbert spaces .",
    "that part relies on tools from both operator algebras , and from probability theory ( e.g. , path - space measures and martingales ) .",
    "first we must identify the appropriate measures on @xmath0 , and secondly , we must build hilbert spaces on associated extension systems @xmath29 , called generalized solenoids .",
    "the appropriate measures @xmath10 on @xmath0 will be constructed using david ruelle s thermodynamical formalism @xcite : we will select our distinguished measures @xmath10 on @xmath0 to have minimal free energy relative to a certain function @xmath30 on @xmath0 .",
    "the relationship between the measures @xmath10 on @xmath0 and a class of induced measures on the extensions @xmath29 is based on a random - walk model which we developed in @xcite , such that the relevant measures on @xmath29 are constructed as path - space measures on paths which originate on @xmath0 .",
    "the transition on paths is governed in turn by a given and prescribed function @xmath30 on @xmath0 .    in the special case of traditional wavelets",
    ", @xmath30 is the absolute square of a so - called low - pass wavelet filter . in these special cases ,",
    "the wavelet - filter functions represent a certain system of functions on the circle @xmath31 which we outline below ; see also our paper @xcite .",
    "even our analysis in @xcite includes wavelet bases on affine cantor sets in @xmath5 . specializing our julia - set cases @xmath32 to the standard wavelet systems",
    ", we get @xmath33 , and the familiar approach to wavelet systems becomes a special case .    according to its original definition , a _",
    "wavelet _ is a function @xmath34 that generates an orthonormal basis under the action of two unitary operators : the dilation and the translation .",
    "in particular , @xmath35 must be an orthonormal basis for @xmath8 , where @xmath36    one of the effective ways of getting concrete wavelets is to first look for a _ multiresolution analysis _ ( _ mra _ ) , that is to first identify a suitable telescoping nest of subspaces @xmath37 of @xmath8 that have trivial intersection and dense union , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 contains a _ scaling function _",
    "@xmath40 such that the translates of @xmath40 form an orthonormal basis for @xmath39 .",
    "the scaling function will necessarily satisfy an equation of the form @xmath41 called the scaling equation ( see also ( [ eqscaling0 ] ) ) .    to construct wavelets",
    ", one has to choose a _ low - pass filter _ @xmath42 and from this obtain the scaling function @xmath40 as the fixed point of a certain cascade operator .",
    "the wavelet @xmath43 ( mother function ) is constructed from @xmath40 ( a father function , or scaling function ) with the aid of two closed subspaces @xmath39 , and @xmath44 . the scaling function @xmath40 is obtained as the solution to a scaling equation ( [ eqscaling ] ) , and its integral translates generates @xmath39 ( the initial resolution ) , and @xmath43 with its integral translates generating @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the next finer resolution subspace containing the initial resolution space @xmath39 , and obtained from a one - step refinement of @xmath39 .",
    "thus the main part of the construction involves a clever choice for the low - pass filter @xmath47 that gives rise to nice orthogonal wavelets .",
    "let @xmath0 be a compact[compactxa ] hausdorff space , and let @xmath48 be a finite - to - one continuous endomorphism , mapping @xmath0 onto itself . as an example , @xmath49 could be a rational mapping of the riemann sphere , and @xmath0 could be the corresponding julia set ; or @xmath0 could be the state space of a subshift associated to a @xmath50@xmath51 matrix .    due to work of brolin[brolina ] @xcite and ruelle @xcite , it is known that for these examples , @xmath0 carries a unique maximal entropy , or minimal free - energy measure @xmath10 also called strongly @xmath22-invariant ; see lemma [ lemfme3_2 ] ( [ lemfme3_2(2 ) ] ) , and equations ( [ eqpr_4 ] ) and ( [ eq3_1])([eq3_2 ] ) below . for each point @xmath52 , the measure @xmath10 distributes the `` mass '' equally on the finite number of solutions @xmath53 to @xmath54 .",
    "we show that this structure in fact admits a rich family of wavelet bases",
    ". now this will be on a hilbert space which corresponds to @xmath8 in the familiar case of multiresolution wavelets .",
    "these are the wavelets corresponding to scaling @xmath55 to @xmath56 , by a fixed integer @xmath57 , @xmath58 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath33 , the circle in @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "so even in the `` classical '' case , there is a `` unitary dilation '' from @xmath61 to @xmath8 in which the haar measure on @xmath62 `` turns into '' the lebesgue measure on @xmath63 .    our work",
    "so far , on examples , shows that this viewpoint holds promise for understanding the harmonic analysis of julia sets , and of other iteration systems . in these cases ,",
    "the analogue of @xmath8 involves quasi - invariant measures @xmath64 on a space @xmath29 , built from @xmath0 in a way that follows closely the analogue of passing from @xmath62 to @xmath63 in wavelet theory . but @xmath64 is now a path - space measure .",
    "the translations by the integers @xmath65 on @xmath8 are multiplications in the fourier dual . for the julia examples ,",
    "this corresponds to the coordinate multiplication , i.e. , multiplication by @xmath66 on @xmath67 , a normal operator .",
    "we get a corresponding covariant system on @xmath29 , where multiplication by @xmath68 is unitarily equivalent to multiplication by @xmath69 .",
    "but this is now on the hilbert space @xmath70 ) , and defined from the path - space measure @xmath64 .",
    "hence all the issues that are addressed since the mid-1980 s for @xmath8-wavelets have analogues in the wider context , and they appear to reveal interesting spectral theory for julia sets .",
    "problems in dynamics are in general irregular and chaotic , lacking the internal structure and homogeneity which is typically related to group actions .",
    "lacking are the structures that lie at the root of harmonic analysis , i.e. , the torus or @xmath71 .",
    "chaotic attractors can be viewed simply as sets , and they are often lacking the structure of manifolds , or groups , or even homogeneous manifolds .",
    "therefore , the `` natural '' generalization , and question to ask , then depends on the point of view , or on the application at hand .    hence , many applied problems are typically not confined to groups ; examples are turbulence , iterative dynamical systems , and irregular sampling .",
    "but there are many more .",
    "yet harmonic analysis and more traditional mra theory begins with @xmath71 , or with some such group context .",
    "the geometries arising in wider contexts of applied mathematics might be attractors in discrete dynamics , in substitution tiling problems , or in complex substitution schemes , of which the julia sets are the simplest .",
    "these geometries are not tied to groups at all .",
    "and yet they are very algorithmic , and they invite spectral - theoretic computations .",
    "julia[juliaa ] sets are prototypical examples of chaotic attractors for iterative discrete dynamical systems ; i.e. , for iterated substitution of a fixed rational function @xmath72 , for @xmath66 in the riemann sphere .",
    "so the julia sets serve beautifully as a testing ground for discrete algorithms , and for analysis on attractors . in our papers",
    "@xcite , @xcite we show that multiscale / mra analysis adapts itself well to discrete iterative systems , such as julia sets , and state space for subshifts in symbolic dynamics .",
    "but so far there is very little computational harmonic analysis outside the more traditional context of @xmath71 .",
    "let[juliasetdefa ] @xmath73 be the riemann sphere , and let @xmath74 be a rational map of degree greater than one .",
    "let @xmath75 be the @xmath76th iteration of @xmath22 , i.e. , the @xmath76th iterated substitution of @xmath22 into itself .",
    "the fatou set @xmath77 of @xmath22 is the largest open set @xmath78 in @xmath73 such that the sequence @xmath75 , restricted to @xmath78 , is a normal family ( in the sense of montel ) .",
    "julia set _",
    "@xmath28 is the complement of @xmath77 .",
    "moreover , @xmath28 is known to behave ( roughly ) like an attractor for the discrete dynamical system @xmath75 .",
    "but it is more complicated : the julia set @xmath28 is the locus of expanding and chaotic behavior ; e.g. , @xmath28 is equal to the closure of the set of repelling periodic points for the dynamical system @xmath75 in @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , @xmath32 is the minimal closed set @xmath0 , such that @xmath79 , and @xmath0 is invariant under the branches of @xmath80 , the inverses of @xmath22 .",
    "while our prior research on julia sets is only in the initial stages , there is already some progress .",
    "we are especially pleased that hilbert spaces of martingales have offered the essential framework for analysis on julia sets .",
    "the reason is that martingale tools are more adapted to irregular structures than are classical fourier methods .    to initiate a harmonic analysis outside the classical context of the tori and of @xmath71 ,",
    "it is thus natural to begin with the julia sets . furthermore , the julia sets are already of active current research interest in geometry and dynamical systems .    but so far , there are only sporadic attempts at a harmonic analysis for julia sets , let alone the more general geometries outside the classical context of groups",
    ". our prior work should prepare us well for this new project .",
    "now , for julia - set geometries , we must begin with the hilbert space .",
    "and even that demands new ideas and new tools .",
    "to accommodate wavelet solutions in the wider context , we built new hilbert spaces with the use of tools from martingale theory .",
    "this is tailored to applications we have in mind in geometry and dynamical systems involving julia sets , fractals , subshifts , or even more general discrete dynamical systems .",
    "the construction of solutions requires a combination of tools that are somewhat non - traditional in the subject .",
    "a number of wavelet constructions in pure and applied mathematics have a common operator - theoretic underpinning .",
    "it may be illustrated with the following operator system : @xmath81 some hilbert space ; @xmath82 a unitary operator ; @xmath83 a unitary representation .",
    "here @xmath62 is the @xmath51-torus , @xmath31 , and @xmath84 is the group of unitary operators in @xmath81 .",
    "the operator system satisfies the identity@xmath85    [ defhomog ] we say that @xmath78 is homogeneous of degree one with respect to the scaling automorphisms defined by @xmath86 if ( [ eqpj820.1 ] ) holds .",
    "in addition , @xmath78 must have the spectral type defined by haar measure .",
    "we say that @xmath78 is homogeneous of degree one if it satisfies ( [ eqpj820.1 ] ) for some representation @xmath87 of @xmath88 .    in the case of the standard wavelets with scale @xmath57 , @xmath89 , where in this case the two operators @xmath78 and @xmath90 are the usual @xmath57-adic scaling and integral translation operators ; see ( [ ut ] ) above giving @xmath78 for the case @xmath91 .",
    "if @xmath92 is a resolution subspace , then @xmath93 .",
    "set @xmath94 , @xmath95the projection onto @xmath96 , @xmath97 , @xmath98 , and@xmath99 then it is easy to check that the pair @xmath100 satisfies the commutation identity ( [ eqpj820.1 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath101 be a parseval frame in @xmath96 .",
    "then@xmath102 is a parseval frame for @xmath81 .",
    "( recall , a parseval frame is also called a normalized tight frame . )",
    "turning the picture around , we[systemuva ] may start with a system @xmath103 which satisfies ( [ eqpj820.1 ] ) , and then reconstruct wavelet ( or frame ) bases in the form ( [ eqpj820.5 ] ) .",
    "to do this in the abstract , we must first understand the multiplicity function calculated for @xmath104 when restricted to the two subspaces @xmath105 and @xmath96 .",
    "but such a multiplicity function may be be defined for any representation of an abelian @xmath106-algebra acting on @xmath81 which commutes with some abstract scaling automorphism ( @xmath107 ) .",
    "this technique can be used for the hilbert spaces associated to julia sets , to construct wavelet ( and frame ) bases in this context .",
    "these systems are studied both in the theory of symbolic dynamics , and in @xmath6-algebra theory , i.e. , for the cuntz  krieger algebras .",
    "it is known[brolinb ] @xcite that , for these examples , @xmath0 carries a unique maximal entropy , or minimal free - energy measure @xmath10 . the most general case when @xmath108 admits a strongly @xmath22-invariant measure is not well understood .",
    "the intuitive[massa ] property of such measures @xmath10 is this : for each point @xmath55 in @xmath0 , @xmath10 distributes the `` mass '' equally on the finite number of solutions @xmath53 to @xmath54",
    ". then @xmath10 is obtained by an iteration of this procedure , i.e. , by considering successively the finite sets of solutions @xmath53 to @xmath109 , for all @xmath110 ; taking an average , and then limit . while the procedure seems natural enough , the structure of the convex set @xmath111 of all the @xmath22-invariant measures is worthy of further study . for the case when @xmath112 the circle , @xmath10 is unique , and it is the haar measure on @xmath88 .",
    "the invariant measures are of interest in several areas : in representation theory , in dynamics , in operator theory , and in @xmath6-algebra theory .",
    "recent work of dutkay ",
    "jorgensen @xcite focuses on special convex subsets of @xmath111 and their extreme points .",
    "this work in turn is motivated by our desire to construct wavelet bases on julia sets .",
    "our work on @xmath111 extends what is know in traditional wavelet analysis .",
    "while linear wavelet analysis is based on lebesgue measure on @xmath5 , and haar measure on the @xmath3-torus @xmath113 , the nonlinear theory is different , and it begins with results from geometric measure theory : we rely on results from @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite . and our adaptation of spectral theory in turn is motivated by work by baggett et al .  in @xcite .",
    "related work reported in @xcite further ties in with exciting advances on graph @xmath6-algebras pioneered by paul muhly , iain raeburn and many more in the @xmath6-algebra community ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "we now prepare the tools in outline , function systems and self - similar operators which will be used in subsection [ mronj ] in the construction of specific hilbert bases in the context of julia sets .",
    "specifically , we outline a construction of a multiresolution / wavelet analysis for the julia set @xmath0 of a given rational function @xmath72 of one complex variable , i.e. , @xmath114 .",
    "such an analysis could likely be accomplished with some kind of wavelet representation induced by a normal operator @xmath90 which is unitarily equivalent to a function of itself .",
    "specifically , @xmath90 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath115 , i.e. , @xmath116 even the existence of these representations would seem to be new and significant in operator theory .",
    "there are consequences and applications of such a construction : first we will get the existence of a finite set of some special generating functions @xmath117 on the julia set @xmath0 that may be useful for other purposes , and which are rather difficult to construct by alternative means .",
    "the relations we require for a system @xmath118 of functions on @xmath28 are as follows:@xmath119 where @xmath120 is a perron ",
    "frobenius eigenfunction for a ruelle operator @xmath25 defined on @xmath121 .",
    "secondly , it follows that for each julia set @xmath0 , there is an infinite - dimensional group which acts transitively on these systems of functions .",
    "the generating functions on @xmath0 we are constructing are analogous to the more familiar functions on the circle @xmath62 which define systems of filters in wavelet analysis .",
    "in fact , the familiar construction of a wavelet basis in @xmath122 is a special case of our analysis .    in the standard wavelet case ,",
    "the rational function @xmath22 is just a monomial , i.e. , @xmath123 where @xmath57 is the number of frequency bands , and @xmath0 is the circle @xmath62 in the complex plane .",
    "the simplest choice of the functions @xmath118 and @xmath120 in this case is @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , and @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "this represents previous work by many researchers , and also joint work between jorgensen and bratteli @xcite .",
    "many applied problems are typically not confined to groups ; examples are turbulence , iterative dynamical systems , and irregular sampling .",
    "but there are many more .    even though attractors such as julia sets are highly nonlinear , there are adaptations of the geometric tools from the analysis on @xmath63 to the nonlinear setting .",
    "the adaptation of traditional wavelet tools to nonlinear settings begins with an essential step : the construction of an appropriate hilbert space ; hence the martingales .",
    "jorgensen , bratteli , and dutkay have developed a representation - theoretic duality for wavelet filters and the associated wavelets , or tight wavelet frames .",
    "it is based on representations of the cuntz algebra @xmath129 ( where @xmath57 is the scale number ) ; see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite . as a by - product of this approach",
    "they get infinite families of inequivalent representations of @xmath129 which are of independent interest in operator - algebra theory .",
    "the mathematical community has long known of operator - theoretic power in fourier - analytic issues , e.g. , rieffel s incompleteness theorem @xcite for gabor systems violating the nyquist condition , cf .",
    "we now feel that we can address a number of significant problems combining operator - theoretic and harmonic analysis methods , as well as broadening and deepening the mathematical underpinnings of our subject .",
    "one reason various geometric notions of multiresolution in hilbert space ( starting with s. mallat ) have proved useful in computational mathematics is that these resolutions are modeled on the fundamental concept of dyadic representation of the real numbers ; or more generally on some variant of the classical positional representation of real numbers . in a dyadic representation of real numbers",
    ", the shift corresponds to multiplication by @xmath130 .",
    "the analogue of that in hilbert space is a unitary operator @xmath78 which scales functions by @xmath130 .",
    "if the hilbert space @xmath81 is @xmath131 , then a resolution is a closed subspace @xmath39 in @xmath81 which is invariant under @xmath78 with the further property that the restriction of @xmath78 to @xmath39 is a shift operator .",
    "positive and negative powers of @xmath78 then scale @xmath81 into a nested resolution system indexed by the integers ; and this lets us solve algorithmic problems by simply following the standard rules from number theory .",
    "however , there is no reason at all that use of this philosophy should be restricted to function spaces on the line , or on euclidean space .",
    "other geometric structures from discrete dynamics admit resolutions as well .",

    "since both constructions , the first one for the lebesgue measure , and the second one for the hausdorff version @xmath583 , arise from scaling and subdivision , it seems reasonable to expect multiresolution wavelets also in hilbert spaces constructed on the scaled hausdorff measures @xmath584 which are basic for the kind of iterated function systems which give cantor constructions built on scaling and translations by lattices .",
    "the authors gratefully acknowledge constructive discussions with richard gundy and roger nussbaum .",
    "further , we are pleased to thank brian treadway for help with tex , with style files , and with proofreading . and especially for making a number of very helpful suggestions .",
    "both authors have benefited from discussions with the members of our nsf focused research group ( dms-0139473 ) , `` wavelets , frames , and operator theory , '' especially from discussions with larry baggett , john benedetto , david larson , and gestur laffson .",
