    ", @xmath2 denotes the diffusivity of the component @xmath3 , the integer powers @xmath4 correspond to the stoichiometry of the reaction , and @xmath5 denotes the corresponding reaction rate .    however , many physical systems exhibit anomalous diffusion ( see e.g. @xcite for reviews and popular accounts ) , which is not adequately described by fick s law . many cases of subdiffusion are successfully modeled within the continuous - time random walk framework ( ctrws ) with power - law on - site waiting time distributions lacking the first moment .",
    "these distributions typically have the form @xmath6 with @xmath7 .",
    "examples include , among others , dispersive charge transport in disordered semiconductors , contaminant transport by underground water and motion of proteins through cell membranes .",
    "on the other hand , successful search strategies in animal motion can be described by lvy walks or flights , often in combination with broad waiting time distributions .",
    "lvy flights are also used as a model for the transport on annealed polymer chains @xcite , which may be relevant for the gene expression @xcite .    for anomalous diffusion ,",

    "however , most attention was payed to the description of the elementary act of reaction on the microscopic scale @xcite .",

    "the situation for the non - markovian subdiffusive transport is much more involved .",
    "the irreversible reaction can be described by an equation for @xmath30 with the transport term depending on the reaction rate , and the equation for the reversible case can not be casted in a form of something resembling a reaction - diffusion equation .",

    "we will use one - dimensional notation in the following , the generalization to higher dimensions is straightforward .",

    "one infers the following asymptotics in laplace space using a tauberian theorem , @xmath56 . for the markovian case ,",
    "as exemplified by the exponential waiting time pdf , @xmath57 , one has @xmath58 in the continuum limit , which corresponds to @xmath59 .",

    "moreover , we introduce the notation @xmath63^{-1}$ ] for what later will be identified as the generalized diffusion coefficient .",
    "the inverse laplace transform of the left hand side of the equation is simply the first time derivative , since @xmath64 .",
    "we first combine the gaussian and lvy distributed jump length pdf with an exponential waiting time pdf . in this case , the pre - factor of @xmath65 in the first term on the right side of the equation does not depend on @xmath66 .",
    "after inverse transforming the equation , it becomes a time - independent operator acting on the concentration as a function of the coordinates . for a gaussian jump length distribution ,",
    "our equation ( [ furla ] ) now reads @xmath67 and for lvy flights , @xmath68 hence , the separation of the transport- and the reaction - term is perfectly exact . for lvy flights ,",
    "the laplace operator is just changed for the riesz - weyl fractional derivative .",
    "now , we turn to subdiffusion and consider a gaussian distribution of the step lengths ( @xmath69 ) combined with a broad waiting time pdf of a pareto type with @xmath70 . from eq.([furla ] ) we then get @xmath71 with the transport operator @xmath72 , which is now time - dependent , @xmath73 its form follows from the shift theorem for the laplace transform .",
    "we see that the reaction parameter enters the transport - term , and the transport operator @xmath74 reduces to a fractional derivative only for @xmath75 . using the laplace",
    "transform property of the riemann - liouville fractional derivative , @xmath76 for @xmath77 , and using the shift theorem , the temporal part of a transport operator ( in its action on the arbitrary function of time @xmath78 ) can be transformed into a form @xcite @xmath79 one can also easily formulate the equations for the combination of pareto waiting times and lvy jumps being of the form @xmath80 with @xmath81 denoting the symmetrized ( riesz - weyl ) spatial fractional derivative .    by the way , as shown in @xcite , an external force field can be included in the model over an asymmetric jump length distribution leading to a fractional fokker - planck equation with the time fractional operator changed for our operator @xmath82 and with an additional reaction term .",
    "let us turn to the equation for the concentration of the @xmath31-particles .",
    "one can distinguish two different cases : ( i ) either a @xmath31-particle takes over the waiting time of the @xmath30-particle that it was converted from , or ( ii ) we assign it a new waiting time when it is produced .",
    "the former means that the conversion is just a relabeling from the standpoint of diffusion and that conversion and transport are totally independent .",
    "the latter is appropriate when @xmath30- and @xmath31-particles have different diffusive properties , e.g. when they are trapped by different kinds of molecules .",
