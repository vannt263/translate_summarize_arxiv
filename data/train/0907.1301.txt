    "the process of star formation is a key phenomenon in astrophysics .",
    "it touches upon a diverse range of topics including galactic evolution , stellar evolution , planet formation , and astrobiology . yet despite the fundamental nature of this process , it remains poorly understood @xcite .",
    "a key issue is determining the support mechanism(s ) that governs star formation , as it is clear stars can not be forming at a free fall timescale @xcite . two competing ideas currently strive to explain the support mechanism ; magnetism plus ambipolar diffusion and turbulence plus a weak magnetic field @xcite . at present , a consensus on the nature of the support mechanism has not been realized .",
    "a particularly important quantity for star formation theory is the mass - to - flux ratio , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the magnetic flux within a region enclosing a mass @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "magnetic support models predict the critical value of this ratio to be equal to @xmath10 @xcite , where @xmath11 is the gravitational constant and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "it follows that the value of @xmath7 normalized to @xmath10 should be close to unity in regions near the point of collapse .",
    "turbulent models place no such restrictions on the mass - to - flux ratio but do predict a chaotic field morphology assuming that flux - freezing holds .",
    "the mass - to - flux ratio can be determined from observables and thus may be used as an important indicator as to the nature of the support mechanism .    at a distance of @xmath13 pc",
    "will be assumed throughout this work . ]",
    "@xcite , a known site of clustered low and intermediate mass star formation , and possessing young embedded cores at an age of @xmath14 @xcite , ngc 1333 is an ideal target for studying the onset of clustered star formation .",
    "two such embedded cores of interest include ngc 1333 iras 4a ( @xmath15 = 3h29m10.42s , @xmath16 = @xmath17@xmath18 , henceforth 4a ) and ngc 1333 iras 4b ( @xmath15 = 3h29m12.06s , @xmath16 = @xmath17@xmath19 , henceforth 4b ) .",
    "note that @xmath15 and @xmath16 will denote j2000 epoch right ascension and declination coordinates throughout this paper , respectively ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 will denote offsets in right ascension and declination from a particular reference point , respectively ) .",
    "the source 4a has been extensively studied in the past @xcite .",
    "we have carried out continuum polarization and spectroscopic observations using , respectively , sharp at @xmath22 towards 4a/4b and the @xmath23@xmath24 heterodyne receiver at the caltech submillimeter observatory ( cso ) on 4a .",
    "it is these data and the subsequent analysis that are presented .",
    "previous work has greatly improved our knowledge of both 4a and 4b .",
    "the interferometric detection of inverse p - cygni profiles towards both of these sources provides strong evidence for infalling gas motions ( di francesco et al .",
    "2001 , hereafter df2001 ) .",
    "the detections were made in @xmath25 @xmath26 emission and have allowed the determination of infall speeds of @xmath27 and @xmath28 for 4a and 4b , respectively .",
    "df2001 also provide simple mass estimates for the gas in each source and find @xmath29 @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath30 within corresponding radii of @xmath32(@xmath33 ) and @xmath34(@xmath35 ) from the peak flux of 4a and 4b , respectively . finally , mass accretion rates of @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 @xmath37 were calculated for both 4a and 4b , respectively .",
    "recent @xmath39 continuum polarimetry done at the submillimeter array ( sma ) has indicated the presence of a well defined pinch in the magnetic field morphology around 4a ( girart et al .",

    "the authors estimate the mass - to - flux ratio to be @xmath40 times the critical value of collapse . along with their computation of the ratio of the turbulent to magnetic energy , @xmath41 ( where @xmath42 is the turbulent line width",
    ", @xmath43 is the alfv@xmath44n speed , and @xmath45 is the intrinsic dispersion in the polarization vectors ; lai et al .",
    "2002 ) , the authors conclude that 4a is an example of a magnetically dominated collapsing cloud core .",
    "a cloud mass of @xmath46 within a radial distance of @xmath47(@xmath48 ) from the peak flux of 4a is also traced by their dust continuum measurements",
    ". taken together , the df2001 & g2006 results present compelling evidence for the notion that the physics of 4a is consistent with standard magnetically - regulated star formation theory .",
    "one problem not addressed in these works is the variation of physical parameters as a function of spatial scales .",
    "of particular interest here is the variation in the magnetic field morphology with spatial scales ; models predict that regions undergoing collapse will drag in the field lines towards the central condensation producing an hourglass morphology . further out from the condensation",
    ", the field morphology should remain in its ambient state @xcite .",
    "the results presented in g2006 illustrate an example of this hourglass morphology at a resolution of @xmath49(@xmath50 ) .",
    "however , due to this small spatial scale g2006 was unable to sample the field morphology at scales larger than @xmath51(@xmath52 ) where models predict the field to be uniform . similarly for the spectroscopy work ,",
    "the high resolution attained through interferometry by df2001 ( @xmath53or @xmath54 ) allowed them to identify infall signatures out to a distance of @xmath55(@xmath56 ) from the peak flux of 4a and 4b .",
    "it is not clear from their results whether or not infall motions are occurring further out from the peak positions .",
    "the aim of this study is to address the problem of spatial scale variation in magnetic fields and infall motions and to complement the work of g2001 and df2001 .",
    "this will be done by analyzing single - dish observations obtained at larger spatial scales and comparing these results with the aforementioned papers . in the following sections we describe both polarimetric and spectroscopic observations carried out at the cso and discuss the implications of our findings . in section [ sec:2 ]",
    "we discuss our observations .",
    "section [ sec:3 ] will cover a general discussion and analysis of our results , and finally in section [ sec:4 ] we state our conclusions .",
    "the following two sub - sections describe the submillimeter dust continuum polarimetry and spectroscopic observations acquired by our group . in section [ sub : polarimetry ]",
    "we discuss @xmath57 polarimetry data collected in september 2008 using sharp , the sharc - ii polarimeter .",
    "section [ sub : spectroscopy ] will discuss the @xmath2  @xmath4 spectroscopic observations taken with the cso @xmath23 @xmath24 heterodyne receiver in september 2000 .",
    "dust continuum polarimetry was done with sharp at @xmath22 with a spatial resolution of @xmath51(@xmath52 ) .",
    "sharp is a fore - optics addition to the sharc - ii camera that enables this instrument to be used as a sensitive polarimeter @xcite .",
    "although both 4a and 4b are studied here , the telescope was pointed onto 4b so as to provide the best possible chance of detecting polarization on this fainter source .",
    "our map was calibrated with approximately 3 hours worth of data obtained on w3(oh ) during the same observing run . in order to account for any random or systematic uncertainties that may remain after applying our standard data reduction pipeline ,",
    "a reduced-@xmath58 analysis was performed on the data .",
    "the measurement uncertainty was correspondingly inflated , on a pixel - by - pixel basis , such that the reduced-@xmath59 .",
    "our results are shown in figure 1 and represent approximately 10.5 hrs of observing time .",
    "several points are worth mentioning from figure 1 : ( 1 ) the extended magnetic field around 4a is clearly sampled in our map .",
    "the nature of the extended field appears to be uniform out to a distance of @xmath60(@xmath61 ) from the peak of this source .",
    "this is consistent with the @xmath62 , effective @xmath5  beamwidth , scupol observations taken at the jcmt @xcite .",
    "our data enables a rough upper - limit to be placed on the size of the magnetic pinch reported in g2006 to one sharp resolution element ( @xmath63or @xmath52 ) .",
    "( 2 ) deviations in the field appear as one moves out beyond @xmath5(@xmath61 ) from 4a towards 4b . in the vicinity of 4b",
    ", the field morphology is rotated by @xmath64 towards the horizontal with respect to the field orientation around 4a .",
    "( 3 ) depolarization is observed towards the peak of 4b , as denoted by open circles on the map where @xmath65 . here",
    "@xmath66 is the degree of polarization and @xmath67 is the corresponding uncertainty in the value of @xmath66 .",
    "significant depolarization is not observed towards 4a .",
    "taken together , these results suggest that 4a and 4b are magnetically distinct objects .",
    "while at first glance the polarimetry of 4a appears to be consistent with conventional ideas of magnetic support , 4b is a more complicated case .",
    "the observed depolarization on 4b may result from changes in the dust grain properties or shapes due to grain - growth @xcite , supersonic and super - alfv@xmath68nic turbulence plus a lack of grain alignment above @xmath69 @xcite , magnetic field geometry and the inclination angle with the line - of - sight @xcite , or finally because of beam smearing over small - scale field structures @xcite .",
    "the last point could be tested in a straightforward manner with high - resolution polarimetry .",
    "in addition , @xcite identify a class i object ( denoted 4bii in the paper ) within close proximity to the younger 4b core .",
    "the existence of this more evolved object is linked to the `` cav2 '' cavity , located to the west of the 4b complex , and may have generated this feature through the action of an ancient outflow @xcite .",
    "it is possible to speculate that turbulence driven by this ancient outflow activity from 4bii may have disrupted the embedded magnetic field and thus contributed to the observed depolarization .",
    "we should note that no such class i objects have been identified within the 4a complex @xcite .",
    "we now look at the position angles of the vectors situated within @xmath5  of the peak of 4a in order to assess the orientation of the large - scale magnetic field around this source .",
    "we assume this large - scale field has a simple , uniform morphology with a polarization angle @xmath70 .",
    "the value of @xmath70 can be calculated by computing the mean of the individual orientation angles @xmath71 , where the subscript @xmath72 denotes the individual vectors .",
    "table [ ta : pol ] contains all the relevant information on all the vectors depicted in figure 1 .    from the data presented in table [ ta : pol ] , a straight arithmetic average of the orientation angles @xmath71 for the vectors situated within a @xmath5  radius of the peak of 4a yields a mean value of @xmath73 .",
    "the dispersion in the orientation angles for these vectors ( @xmath74 ) is found to be @xmath75 .",
    "we therefore adopt @xmath73 as the orientation angle of the large - scale uniform magnetic field around 4a .",
    "the g2006 result of @xmath76 for their field orientation is approximately a @xmath77 deviation from our result , implying the two values are consistent with one another .",
    "uncertainties in our methods could account for the @xmath78 discrepancy ; we admittedly assume a very simple uniform model for the field orientation , ignoring any possible non - uniform large scale structure to the morphology .",
    "the main outflow from 4a extends @xmath79with a position angle of about @xmath80 for a line drawn from one tip of the outflow to the other , but this rotates to @xmath81 for the inner part of the outflow confined to a radius of approximately @xmath82@xcite .",
    "the reason for the change in orientation of the outflow is unknown ; cloud core rotation may have played a role .",
    "a discussion of the full implications of this finding on the role of rotational support in the formation of 4a is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "one would expect to see a significant deviation in the field morphology from small to large spatial scales if centrifugal forces were dominant in this system @xcite .",
    "instead , the polarimetry results presented here plus those obtained at smaller spatial scales ( g2006 ) indicate otherwise .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a binary system within 4a shows centrifugal forces could not be negligible in the formation of this system .",
    "all of this information is consistent with the idea that the magnetic and centrifugal forces were comparable in magnitude for this system during the onset of collapse ( g2006 ) .",
    "in addition , it should be noted that the large - scale uniform magnetic field implied by our results is aligned with the original ( i.e. , large - scale ) orientation of the outflow from 4a .",
    "finally , we wish to calculate the mean intrinsic dispersion angle ( @xmath45 ) over 4a by comparing our observations with the adopted uniform magnetic field model with @xmath73 .",
    "now @xmath45 is given by @xmath83 , where @xmath84 is the uncertainty in the observed position angle .",
    "we calculate values of @xmath85 and @xmath86 and as such work out @xmath45 to be @xmath87 .",
    "we will employ this value in our general discussion in section [ sec:3 ] .",
    "note that we do not attempt a similar analysis with our results over 4b .",
    "it is apparent from figure 1 that we can not fit our vectors over this source to a simple model for the field orientation ( plus no polarization is detected over the peak flux of this source ) . as such",
    ", it is not possible to calculate a meaningful average field orientation @xmath70 or intrinsic dispersion @xmath45 for 4b .",
    "observations of the @xmath2 @xmath4 ( @xmath88 ) rotational transition from 4a were made with the cso 300 - 400 ghz heterodyne receiver .",
    "the beam size at this frequency is approximately @xmath5  ( @xmath89 ) and thus samples a far larger region of space than was obtained with df2001 .",
    "detections were obtained for a sequence of points lying approximately along the outflow axis of 4a , as well as for a single point that was displaced from the center in the perpendicular direction . in total seven different positions",
    "were looked at , the results are illustrated in figure 2 .",
    "what is immediately clear is the presence of a peak followed by a dip in the line emission centered on 4a and the two positions lying closest to it along the red - lobe of the outflow .",
    "we should note that the presence of the red - lobe outflow will distort our spectra , as the background that our source absorbs against is not flat but the outflow emission itself .",
    "therefore an interpretation of our data becomes clearer once the outflow component of the spectra is fitted with a gaussian and removed , as was done using the class software package and is shown in figure 3 .",
    "the spectra in figure 3 are characterised solely by the aforementioned emission peak and dip , with the dip being situated to the right of the peak in each case .",
    "each maxima and minima are observed at velocities of @xmath90 and @xmath91 , respectively .",
    "the full - width - half - maximum of each peak and dip profile is approximately @xmath92 , and the point between the maxima and minima where the line temperature @xmath93 equals @xmath94 corresponds to a velocity of approximately @xmath95 in each case .",
    "these data have exactly the same characteristics as the @xmath96 spectra presented in figure 4 of df2001 and are thus characteristic of inverse p - cygni profiles . with this interpretation",
    "we note that the spectral signatures seen in figure 2 are characteristic of an infalling envelope of gas around 4a plus a outflow .",
    "these features are not observed towards the blue - lobe of the outflow .",
    "this is to be expected due to the position of the blue - lobe outflow , which is situated in between the infalling envelope and the observer .",
    "therefore , this component of the outflow does not provide a background against which the infalling material can absorb .",
    "we do not have spectroscopy data on 4b at this time , and as such we can not comment on the nature of gas motions around this core .",
    "one also notices the disappearance of the inverse p - cygni profile at a offset position of @xmath97 , @xmath98  along the red - lobe outflow .",
    "we can therefore state that the peak of 4a is surrounded by an infalling envelope of radius @xmath99 on the plane of the sky , where @xmath100 .",
    "the lower bound of @xmath99 is provided by the spectra obtained at an offset position of @xmath101 , @xmath102 ; the furthest position away from the peak of 4a at which the infall signature is still clearly apparent .",
    "the range of @xmath99 specified here is consistent with the value of @xmath103 predicted by models of self - gravitating cores @xcite .",
    "note that this estimate relies upon the assumption that nothing obstructs our view of the infall signature at a radial distance @xmath104 from the peak flux of 4a .",
    "adopting @xmath105 , we immediately note that the size of the infalling envelope is approximately @xmath106 times larger than the upper limit placed on the size of the magnetic pinch observed around 4a ( see section [ sub : polarimetry ] ) .",
    "this result is consistent with theoretical work on the collapse of magnetized cloud cores @xcite .",
    "to further our investigation of the 4a system we fit our three inverse p - cygni profile detections to an enhanced version of the two - layer model originally devised by @xcite and later used by df2001 . in its most general form ,",
    "our treatment of this problem is to envisage two parallel layers of material moving towards an opaque central condensation .",
    "these two layers , denoted `` front slab '' and `` rear slab '' , represent the infalling envelope .",
    "the opaque source is taken to fill a fraction @xmath107 of the telescope beam .",
    "this setup is the model of df2001 , where the presence of outflows was not accounted for . for our model , two more layers of material are included in this system to represent the blue- and red - lobe outflows .",
    "this scenario is illustrated in figure 4 .    quantifying this model into an expression of the line brightness temperature @xmath108 at a certain velocity @xmath109 we obtain equation ( 1 ) below .",
    "note the subscripts @xmath110 , @xmath111 , @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 represent the blue - lobe outflow , red - lobe outflow , front slab , rear slab , central source , and cosmic background parameters , respectively .",
    "therefore the analytical model for the scenario depicted in figure 4 is :    @xmath116    where @xmath117 is the planck temperature as a function of the blackbody temperature @xmath118 , and @xmath119 where @xmath120 is the planck constant , @xmath121 is the boltzmann constant , and @xmath122 is the frequency . the optical depth for model component @xmath72 is denoted as @xmath123 . finally we note that @xmath124 and @xmath125 .",
    "following @xcite we model the different optical depths with gaussian profiles :    @xmath126\\ ] ]    @xmath127,\\ ] ]    where @xmath128 and @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 are the peak optical depths , @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the respective velocity dispersions , and the velocity for the local standard of rest is taken to be @xmath134 ( df2001 ) .",
    "note that @xmath135 and @xmath136 are the infall velocities for the front and rear slabs , respectively .",
    "we can simplify ( 1 ) by making note of two important properties of our data .",
    "first , our large beam size implies @xmath137 ( df2001 get a value of @xmath138 with a @xmath139  beam ) .",
    "second , we neglect the contribution of the blue - lobe , as only the red - lobe component of the outflow provides the background radiation against which the infalling material can absorb .",
    "it is clear from figure 2 that the spectra centered on ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) has a significant blue - lobe outflow component while the spectra centered on ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) and ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) are largely dominated by the red - lobe outflow . as such",
    ", our outflow approximation will be especially coarse in the case of the spectra centered on the peak flux of 4a . by setting @xmath144 and @xmath145 in equation ( 1 )",
    "we get :    @xmath146    where @xmath147 .",
    "a computer program was written to minimize the reduced-@xmath58 function generated by comparing equation ( 4 ) with a multi - gaussian fit to the three aforementioned spectra in figure 2 that exhibit inverse p - cygni profiles .",
    "the minimization was carried out through the use of powell s method for multidimensional functions @xcite .",
    "the resulting fit of equation ( 4 ) to our spectra at offset positions ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) , and ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) are shown in figure 5 .",
    "the plots shown in figure 5 demonstrate a reasonably good agreement between the actual data and the model .",
    "we should take stock at this point to stress that this model provides the simplest possible explanation for a contracting system with outflow .",
    "as such , it will provide us with only an approximate picture of the physical properties at play in 4a and its surroundings .",
    "this is especially true with regards to the optical depths and temperatures of the absorbing / emitting gas ( df2001 ) .",
    "it should also be mentioned that the resolution of our data prevents us from distinguishing between small - scale structures , such as the binary system at the core of the 4a complex ( dubbed 4a1 and 4a2 , g2006 ) .",
    "although we dispense with the optically thick central condensation in equation ( 4 ) , each member of the binary system drives a unique outflow @xcite . by far",
    "the dominant outflow originates from 4a2 , which possesses a length @xmath148 times longer and is more luminous than the outflow associated with 4a1 @xcite .",
    "our spectra likely sample an average of the environment of 4a , with detections of both outflows being integrated for data obtained on the peak flux of 4a .",
    "however , it is unlikely the data obtained away from the peak will be affected by the outflow of 4a1 , since this outflow is limited in extent and has a position angle shifted by @xmath149 to the position angle of the much larger 4a2 outflow . despite these shortcomings , our model is still useful for the comparison of the infall velocity between different spectra , since the ratio @xmath150 ( or @xmath151 ) is a key parameter for any model of a contracting system ( df2001 ; leung & brown 1977 ) .",
    "the model parameters resulting from the simulations shown in figure 5 are listed in table [ ta : spe ] .",
    "one notices immediately that @xmath152 for each scan , where the values of @xmath135 tend to be close to a speed of @xmath153 while @xmath136 tends to have values closer to @xmath154 .",
    "a likely explanation for this is that the value of @xmath155 set in our model is somewhat inaccurate , and thus introduces a systematic error in our calculations .",
    "we note df2001 leave @xmath155 as a free parameter in their version of the `` two - layered '' model .",
    "our attempt to treat @xmath155 as a free parameter in equation ( 4 ) failed to produce satisfactory results .",
    "this may be due to the highly non - linear nature of our model , which makes an iterative fit of equation ( 4 ) to a particular data set very sensitive to the initial parameter values .",
    "the simplest means to proceed was by fixing @xmath155 to the df2001 value .",
    "the differences between equation ( 4 ) and the df2001 model may account for the different @xmath155 value in our case . to correct for this",
    "we take an arithmetic average of the @xmath135 and @xmath136 values listed in table [ ta : spe ] , which result in mean infall velocities of @xmath156 , @xmath157 , and @xmath158 for the scans at offset positions ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) , and ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , respectively .",
    "taking all three scans together we estimate a mean infall velocity of @xmath159 for 4a , a value that is very similar to the @xmath160 velocity calculated by df2001 . if we assume a gas temperature of @xmath161 @xcite we can calculate the isothermal sound speed @xmath162 to be @xmath163 , where @xmath121 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath164 is the mean molecular weight ( @xmath165 ) , and @xmath166 is the mass of hydrogen . thus the observed infall is also supersonic .",
    "assuming inside - out collapse for 4a , we note that the radius @xmath99 of the expansion wave for the infalling envelope is given by @xmath167 , where @xmath168 is defined above and @xmath169 is the time since the onset of collapse . taking @xmath105 ( see section [ sub : spectroscopy ] ) , we find @xmath170 .",
    "a large degree of uncertainty exists with regards to the age of the outflow , but estimates range from @xmath171 @xcite . therefore the age of the infalling envelop in 4a is roughly @xmath172 times the age of the associated outflow .",
    "outflow velocities along the line - of - sight of @xmath173 , @xmath174 , and @xmath175 are estimated from the fits of equation ( 4 ) to the scans at offset positions ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) , and ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) , respectively .",
    "the latter two values indicate the red - lobe outflow has an approximate velocity of @xmath176 .",
    "the negative value for the velocity at position ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) is to due to the fact that equation ( 4 ) treats for a red - lobe outflow only , while the spectrum at this position shows a significant blue - lobe outflow as well .",
    "the velocity values for both red - lobe outflows are approximately consistent with @xmath177 @xmath178 observations presented in @xcite and illustrated in figure 5 of that paper .",
    "the outflow observed at position ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) is a composite of both the red- and blue - lobes and hence our model does not provide a reliable outflow velocity for this case .",
    "as a final note we wish to briefly discuss our handling of the outflow velocity @xmath179 employed in our model for the scan at position ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) . because of the simplifications introduced into equation ( 4 ) , where only the red - lobe outflow",
    "is included analytically , it is necessary to set this parameter to a negative value in order to fit the composite red- and blue - lobe outflow that are present in this spectrum .",
    "although this points out a shortcoming of our model , the important point here is to maintain emitting gas in the background of the infalling envelope ; a red - lobe outflow .",
    "this component of the model provides emission from a backdrop of material against which the infalling gas can absorb and thus produce the dip present in a inverse p - cygni profile .",
    "this is the reason why @xmath179 is negative in equation ( 4 ) at position ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) . despite this obvious defect ,",
    "the model used here is the simplest mathematical construct that still conveys physical meaning for the data at hand .",
    "future work may wish to employ more sophisticated monte carlo techniques to generate models that more accurately describe this source .",
    "we now proceed to calculate a mass estimate for 4a and 4b .",
    "this can be achieved through a careful treatment of the thermal dust continuum data from sharp .",
    "the mass of a cloud can be estimated via its submillimeter thermal emission by :    @xmath180    where @xmath111 is the gas to dust ratio , @xmath181 is the density of the dust material , @xmath182 is the distance to the cloud , @xmath183 is the measured flux density , @xmath184 is the planck function with dust temperature @xmath185 , @xmath186 is the grain radius , and @xmath187 is the dust emissivity @xcite . here",
    "we assume values of @xmath188 , @xmath189 , @xmath190 , @xmath191 , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 , where the dust temperature was chosen to be the same value as that employed in g2006 .",
    "the values of @xmath181 , @xmath186 , and @xmath187 were taken or inferred from @xcite .",
    "the total amount of @xmath22 flux detected within a radial distance of @xmath5(@xmath61 ) from 4a is @xmath194 , while a total of @xmath195 was detected within @xmath196(@xmath52 ) of 4b .",
    "the distance around 4a was selected to encompass the polarimetry vectors used in the calculation of @xmath45 in section [ sub : polarimetry ] . with this information",
    ", the mass of 4a and 4b is estimated to be @xmath197 and @xmath198 , respectively .",
    "these values are comparable to the mass estimates of df2001 and g2006 that are stated in section [ sec : introduction ] of this work . as a final point",
    "we note that the total flux detected in figure 1 is @xmath199 . from this flux value a total detected mass of @xmath200",
    "is calculated for the area of ngc 1333 iras 4 mapped by our continuum observations .",
    "we can now apply a modified form of the chandrasekhar & fermi ( cf ) technique @xcite to obtain an estimate of the magnetic field strength around 4a .",
    "if we assume the dispersion in our magnetic field map ( see figure 1b ) is entirely due to alfv@xmath68n waves and/or turbulence , then the plane - of - sky magnetic field strength will be given by :    @xmath201    here we take @xmath202 , the same value used in g2006 and one that is indicated by simulations of turbulent molecular clouds @xcite .",
    "we have already calculated @xmath203 in section [ sec:2 ] .",
    "the gas density @xmath204 can be roughly estimated by dividing the mass of 4a calculated above by the volume of a @xmath5(@xmath61 ) radius sphere .",
    "doing this yields a density of @xmath205 .",
    "the line - of - sight velocity dispersion @xmath206 is taken from observations of @xmath3 @xmath4 obtained at the same time ( and using the same heterodyne receiver ) as the @xmath2 observations discussed earlier .",
    "these data were obtained while pointing on the peak flux of 4a and are shown in figure 6 .",
    "the choice of analyzing this spectrum for the @xmath206 value is motivated by the fact that an ion will be better coupled to the magnetic field ( and the dust ) than a neutral species over the whole turbulent energy density spectrum @xcite .",
    "thus the line width of this species will be more representative of the turbulence / alfv@xmath44n waves that may be disturbing the field as opposed to a neutral molecular counterpart .",
    "the value of @xmath206 is found to be @xmath207 .",
    "inserting this information into equation ( 6 ) yields a field strength of @xmath208 , a value that is roughly a factor of @xmath209 lower than the g2006 result .",
    "this difference is not unexpected since the field strength should increase towards the center of the core , as this is the location of maximum compression of the field lines .",
    "one could thus expect the value of @xmath210 to diminish at larger spatial scales .",
    "we are now in a position to calculate the mass - to - flux ratio for our observations on 4a . writing this quantity in terms of the critical value for collapse @xmath211",
    "we find :    @xmath212    where @xmath12 @xcite , @xmath8 is the magnetic flux , and @xmath11 is the gravitational constant . using this relation we calculate @xmath213 over a region of @xmath214 centered on the peak of 4a .",
    "this value is a factor of @xmath215 lower than unity and also notably lower than the g2006 result .",
    "a strongly sub - critical cloud is also inconsistent with our own observations of infalling gas motions ( section [ sub : spectroscopy ] ) .",
    "uncertainties in our estimate of @xmath9 may be partly responsible ; submillimeter continuum emission will fail to sample the hot protostellar mass where dust particles can not exist .",
    "we should note that the use of the plane - of - sky component of the magnetic field will result in an underestimate of @xmath8 and thus lead to a overestimation of @xmath211 .",
    "recent work suggests the inclination angle @xmath216 of the embedded magnetic field in this cloud falls within the range @xmath217 @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the magnitude of @xmath218 could fall somewhere within @xmath219 .",
    "therefore we can speculate that this effect could result in an overestimation of @xmath211 by up to a factor of @xmath40 .",
    "a more likely explanation for the sub - critical value of @xmath211 may come from the application of the cf technique itself . crucial to this calculation is an accurate measure of the intrinsic dispersion angle @xmath45 of the magnetic field vectors .",
    "polarimetry , however , does not distinguish between contributions along the line - of - sight ; the result being that the angular dispersion will be reduced through the process of signal integration through the thickness of the cloud as well as across the area subtended by the telescope beam @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath45 that is then calculated could be smaller than the true dispersion and thus may result in an overestimation of @xmath210 through equation ( 6 ) . despite the fact that the factor @xmath220 in equation ( 6 ) is meant to account for the problem of signal integration through the cloud @xcite , in reality this is only a first - order correction and the smoothing effect could be more severe @xcite .",
    "higher resolution polarimetry across the large spatial scales observed here in conjunction with a more in - depth analysis may be used in the future to resolve this issue @xcite .",
    "we can now calculate the ratio of the turbulent to magnetic energy ( @xmath221 ) in 4a .",
    "the value we determine for this quantity is @xmath222 , suggesting magnetic forces dominate the physics of this particular cloud . from our discussion above we note that the field strength calculated here could be overestimated by a factor of a few .",
    "this could result from an underestimate of the intrinsic dispersion in the polarimetry @xmath45 .",
    "for example , a requirement for a critical value of @xmath211 would be an intrinsic dispersion value of @xmath223 .",
    "this would then correspond to a value of @xmath224 , a value sufficiently close to unity to suggest an equipartition of the turbulent and magnetic energies in this system .",
    "these results are definitely not consistent with is the idea of a turbulent - dominated support system for this cloud . since models of magnetically - supported star formation predict @xmath225 for cloud cores undergoing collapse , we conclude that our results are likely consistent with the idea that the turbulent and magnetic energies are of the same order of magnitude in this system .",
    "we summarize our results as follows :    * dust continuum polarimetry done at @xmath22 with sharp demonstrates a uniform magnetic field morphology around 4a at a resolution scale of @xmath196(@xmath52 ) .",
    "we therefore adopt the size of one resolution element to be an approximate upper limit on the size of the magnetic pinch region reported in g2006 .",
    "this is in agreement with magnetic cloud collapse theory and correlates well with the findings of g2006 .",
    "in addition , the large - scale uniform magnetic field appears to be aligned with the original ( large - scale ) outflow direction for 4a .",
    "why the large - scale and small - scale directions of the 4a outflow are different is not known , but our results and those of g2006 show that the average orientation of the magnetic field has not changed direction from large - scales to small .",
    "the polarimetry obtained on 4b appears to indicate depolarization towards the peak flux region .",
    "an explanation for these observations on 4b remains an open point .",
    "mass estimates for both 4a and 4b have been made revealing @xmath226 within @xmath5(@xmath61 ) and @xmath227 within @xmath196(@xmath52 ) of the peak flux for both cores , respectively .",
    "the total mass traced by our continuum observations is @xmath228 for the portion of the ngc 1333 iras 4 cloud complex surveyed .",
    "* spectroscopy done at the cso with @xmath2 @xmath4 line emission has revealed inverse p - cygni profiles at offset positions ( @xmath140 , @xmath141 ) , ( @xmath142 , @xmath143 ) , and ( @xmath101 , @xmath102 ) from the location of peak flux for 4a .",
    "fitting these data with an enhanced version of the @xcite two - layer model , we estimate a mean infall speed of @xmath229 for this cloud core .",
    "these findings are in good agreement with the results of df2001 .",
    "the radial size of the infalling envelope @xmath99 is estimated to range between @xmath100 and is thus approximately @xmath106 times larger than the size of the magnetic pinch .",
    "this is consistent with theoretical work on magnetized cloud collapse @xcite .",
    "the age of the infalling envelope is found to be approximately @xmath230 ; a figure that is roughly @xmath172 times larger than the age of the associated outflow .",
    "* the value of the plane - of - sky component of the magnetic field strength has been estimated to be @xmath231 around 4a .",
    "this yields a normalized mass to flux ratio of @xmath213 .",
    "this value of @xmath211 is inconsistent with our observations of infalling gas motions and does not agree with the previous results of g2006 .",
    "we speculate here that @xmath45 may be underestimated due to smoothing effects in the angular dispersion along the line - of - sight that is characteristic of polarimetry .",
    "if we inflate our value of @xmath45 by a factor of @xmath232 , we then find that @xmath224 .",
    "this suggests an equipartition of the magnetic and turbulent energies in this cloud .",
