    "the advent of the iris mission @xcite has provided unprecedented continuous time series of  spectra ( and slit - jaw filtergrams ) with high spatial , spectral , and temporal resolution , which no observatory before could do concurrently .",
    "this wealth of  spectra is making a difference in how the chromosphere is understood and has great potential for the future .    to understand the complex formation of the  lines in the sun ,",
    "several studies have been undertaken , starting with the early work of @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "more recent work has focused on understanding their formation over a range of solar positions @xcite , their polarization potential @xcite , their formation in prominences @xcite , and their diagnostic value using 3d radiative magneto - hydrodynamic ( rmhd ) models @xcite .",
    "all of these studies focused on the  lines ; notably absent was any detailed investigation on the companion triplet of lines between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 states ( an exception is * ? ? ? * who studied these lines above the solar limb ) , with vacuum wavelengths of 279.160 , 279.875 , and 279.882 nm ( henceforth referred to as triplet lines ) .    with their lower levels being the upper levels of the  lines ( see figure 1 of @xcite ) ,",
    "the triplet lines sit on the wings of the  lines ( one line on the blue wing of the k line , and two overlapping lines located between the k and the h line ) .",
    "this transition structure bears some resemblance to that of the  atom , whose infrared triplet lines ( 849.8 , 854.2 , and 866.2 nm ) share the upper level of the h&k lines . with",
    "the  infrared triplet firmly established as a chromospheric diagnostic in recent literature ( in particular the 854.2  nm line , see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) , a study of the diagnostic potential of the  triplet is both timely and relevant .",
    "the  triplet lines are generally much weaker than their famous siblings and appear mostly as absorption lines . nevertheless , in energetic events they become emission lines .",
    "given the gap in the literature on these lines , in this work we set forth to answer the following questions : in which conditions do these triplet lines form , and what can we learn from them ?",
    "under what circumstances do they become emission lines ?",
    "the lines have already been extensively observed by iris ( the lines around 279.88  nm are included in virtually all iris observations ) , so any insight can be useful for a wide range of observations . to understand the formation of the lines we employ 3d rmhd models , in a similar way to what @xcite and @xcite did for the  lines .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in  [ sec : spectra ] , we describe the simulations used and how the synthetic spectra were calculated , and in  [ sec : results ] we study how the  triplet lines are typically formed in quiet sun . in  [ sec : emission ] we investigate the conditions that lead to emission in the triplet lines , both in a quiet sun simulation and a flaring simulation . in  [ sec : obs ] we show some examples of emission profiles observed with iris , and we conclude with a discussion in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "to study the formation of the  triplet , we follow the approach of @xcite and @xcite and make use of 3d rmhd simulations performed with the _ bifrost _ code @xcite .    solves the resistive mhd equations on a staggered cartesian grid .",
    "a @xmath5 mm@xmath6 region of the solar atmosphere was simulated , with a constant horizontal cell spacing of 48  km and non - uniform vertical spacing , extending from 2.4  mm below the average @xmath7 height and up to 14.4  mm , covering the upper convection zone , photosphere , chromosphere , and lower corona .",
    "the radial curvature of the sun is neglected .",
    "the simulations employed include a detailed radiative transfer treatment including coherent scattering @xcite , a recipe for non - local thermodynamical equilibrium ( non - lte ) radiative losses from the upper chromosphere to the corona @xcite , and thermal conduction along magnetic field lines @xcite .",
    "we use two simulation snapshots from different runs : an `` enhanced - network '' quiet sun simulation and an emerging flux simulation with some small flares .",
    "the quiet sun simulation snapshot is the same as used in other papers of this series ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein for more details ) , which includes non - equilibrium hydrogen ionization in the equation of state @xcite .",
    "the photospheric mean unsigned magnetic field strength of the simulation is about 5  mt ( 50  g ) , concentrated in two clusters of opposite polarity , placed diagonally 8  mm apart in the horizontal plane .",
    "we also use a snapshot from the `` flaring '' simulation of @xcite . in this emerging flux simulation a uniform magnetic flux sheet with @xmath8  mt and of dimension @xmath9mm@xmath10 is injected into a numerical domain of @xmath11  mm that contains a weak initial field of @xmath12  mt .",
    "the model has fully developed convection and a certain percentage of the injected field emerges into the chromosphere and corona in a non uniform manner , leading to patchy reconnection , as loops expanding through the photosphere into the upper atmosphere come into contact with each other .",
    "the reconnection leads to structures resembling small flares .",
    "we use the snapshot at @xmath13  s in which several such flares are present .",
    "further details of this simulation setup can be found in @xcite .",

    ", we performed the calculations for every other spatial point in the horizontal directions .",
    "we find that the effects of partial redistribution ( prd ) in the triplet lines are negligible , therefore we assumed complete redistribution ( crd ) for all calculations of these lines , while calculating the  lines in prd ( using the fast angle - dependent approximation of * ? ? ?",
    "]    in the quiet sun , the  triplet lines are observed mostly as absorption lines ( see e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is also the case in our synthetic spectra from the quiet sun simulation : the lines are in emission in @xmath15% of the points .",

    "compared to the 279.160  nm line , the 279.882  nm line has an oscillator strength twice as high ; in terms of formation height this translates to a difference of less than 100  km in most cases .",
    "the 279.875  nm line is the weakest , which makes the blend in this region asymmetric , with a centroid shifted toward the red .",
    "the lines exist in a heavily blended region .",

    "we took the average @xmath23 and column mass of the  and  features .",
    "one can see how the  features and the triplet lines cover distinct regions in the range of @xmath24  mm , or @xmath25 and therefore can complement each other as diagnostics of the chromosphere .",
    "under particular conditions the triplet lines become emission lines . this seems to happen when there is a rapid increase of temperature with height in the region around the temperature minimum .",
    "with such temperature rises , the source function is still close to the planck function and follows its rise before dropping down in higher layers , causing an emission line . in the synthetic spectra ,",
    "emission in the line cores is very rare in the quiet sun simulation ( @xmath26 of the columns ) but much more common in the flaring simulation ( @xmath27 of the columns ) .",
    "the conditions for emission become clear in figure  [ fig : form_diag_qs ] , where in panel ( b ) a steep temperature increase at @xmath28  mm leads the source function to peak and then drop , causing an emission line .",
    "here we define `` emission '' as the intensity in the line core being higher than in the line wings . in the quiet sun simulation",
    "one finds about 1% of the columns with emission `` bumps '' in the far wings  these correspond to locations where the heating takes place at deeper layers and have essentially the same formation mechanism as the profiles with emission in the line core .",
    "nevertheless , for the remainder of this section we restrict ourselves to the more extreme events of line core emission .    in figure",
    "[ fig : histograms ] we show distributions for the ranges of heights , column mass , and electron densities where the lines are formed . unlike in figure",
    "[ fig : histograms_k ] , where we show the distributions for @xmath23 , here we show the ranges of typical conditions where the lines are formed .",
    "the distributions are given for the maximum and minimum @xmath23 , the heights where the optical depth reaches unity , and for the values of column mass , electron density and temperature at those maximum and minimum heights .",
    "the bulk of the line is formed in the region between the maximum and minimum distributions , with the line wings formed close to the minimum heights , and the line center formed closer to the maximum heights . reflecting the very different density profiles ,",
    "the lines are formed much higher in the emerging flux flaring simulation than in the quiet sun simulation . however , when shown on a column mass scale the formation region is very similar .",
    "the electron density and temperature distributions are more convoluted , and again reflect the differences between the simulations . in the flaring simulation there is a subset of columns with very cool mid - chromospheres , and this causes a double peaked distribution for the temperature of maximum height of formation .",
    "there is a clear tendency for the regions in emission to be formed at lower column mass densities , higher up in the atmosphere ; this is true for both the quiet sun simulation and the flaring simulation .",

[",
    "fig : tdiff_s ] ]         the emission in the lines is caused by a source function increase in the formation region of the line centers .",
    "typically , this increase in the source function is caused by a large temperature increase in the lower chromosphere ( @xmath38  k ) .",
    "nevertheless , there are many cases when large increases do occur , but the source function does not follow the temperature and the lines are in absorption .",
    "while there are many factors that affect the coupling between the source function and the local temperatures , the source function tends to be more tightly coupled to the temperature in regions with higher electron density . in figure  [ fig : tdiff_ne ] we show a scatter plot and distributions of @xmath31 versus the maximum electron density , for the quiet sun simulation . for each simulation column",
    ", @xmath31 is the difference between the maximum temperature between the column masses of @xmath39 and @xmath40 and the minimum temperature between the column masses of @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( in other words , the temperature difference between the line core forming regions and the line wing forming regions ) .",
    "the maximum electron density @xmath43 is taken between the column masses of @xmath39 to @xmath40 ( the line core forming region ) .",
    "the columns with emission lines appear clearly clustered in regions with a large temperature difference and high electron density ( the distribution of @xmath43 for emission columns peaks at around @xmath44  m@xmath1 ) .",
    "the presence of emission in the triplet lines can be an important indicator that the lower chromosphere has been heated .",
    "in addition , it can also be used to quantify the temperature increase that leads to emission .",
    "we find that the eddington - barbier approximation holds for the triplet lines . under lte conditions",
    "one would expect the intensity to follow the temperature variations .",
    "however , despite some coupling to the local temperature ( see discussion above ) , the source function does not completely follow the quick temperature increases that give rise to emission .",
    "still , we find that one can nevertheless derive a quantitative estimate of the temperature increase from the line intensity , and demonstrate it in figure  [ fig : tdiff_s ] .",
    "we plot an observable from the two blended triplet lines , the @xmath45 intensity ratio between the line core maximum ( in the @xmath46  nm interval ) and the line wing ( here taken at 279.932  nm ) against @xmath31 , a temperature difference given by different quantities .",
    "the different @xmath31 are differences between the line core and wing forming regions .",
    "@xmath47 gives the physical temperature difference in the line forming region , while @xmath48 is a proxy for the temperature difference as `` measured '' by the source function ; the discrepancy between the two is a measure of how the source function departs from the local temperature .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : tdiff_s ] , both @xmath31 are correlated with the observable @xmath45 . when plotted against @xmath49 ,",
    "the relation with @xmath50 is nearly linear  a consequence of the eddington - barbier approximation : the source function and intensity are closely correlated .",
    "when plotted against @xmath49 , one can still mostly recover the linear relation with @xmath50 , but there is an added offset and increased scatter . for clarity",
    "we show only the results for the quiet sun simulation in figure  [ fig : tdiff_s ] , but the results for the flaring simulation are essentially the same . within the uncertainties ,",
    "this enables one to use @xmath45 to directly quantify the localized heating in the lower chromosphere when the triplet lines are in emission , making it a powerful diagnostic .        in figure",
    "[ fig : form_diag_flare ] we show example line formation diagrams for the flaring simulation .",
    "case ( a ) is an extreme example with strong velocity and temperature gradients alternating in rapid succession in height .",
    "the resulting triplet lines are formed over a very large height range and show a strong emission profile .",
    "there are two large peaks of the source function at around @xmath51  mm , which roughly follow large temperature increases . near the line core",
    "the @xmath52  mm peak is dominant , making the line profile nearly single peaked .",
    "case ( b ) depicts a very different scenario : here the line is formed over a shallow height range ( @xmath53  mm ) , where the velocities are relatively small . in this case",
    "there are two temperature bumps at @xmath54  mm , where the densities are high enough that the source function follows .",
    "this causes a triple - peaked profile .",
    "there is another , much larger , temperature increase at @xmath55  mm and corresponding bump in the source function .",
    "however , at these higher layers there is very little opacity at these wavelengths , and correspondingly their contribution to the line profile is negligible .",
    "( at @xmath56  mm the column mass in this location is @xmath57 , just outside the range where the lines are sensitive . )    as evidenced by the line profiles in figures  [ fig : form_diag_qs ] and [ fig : form_diag_flare ] , the shape of the emission lines also provides important information about the underlying physical conditions .",
    "double , triple , or multi - peaked profiles are mostly caused by a temperature profile with several rapid variations in height .",
    "single - peaked lines tend to come from a dominant temperature increase , typically in higher layers .",
    "if a single temperature increase occurs deep in the atmosphere , at high densities , the emission manifests itself in the far wings of the triplet lines , with the line core a normal absorption profile ( when this happens , the  lines are also much wider than normal ) . in the quiet sun simulation ,",
    "there are in fact twice as many columns with far wing emission profiles than columns with emission in the line core .",
    "the  triplet lines are routinely observed with the iris spectrograph . in figure",
    "[ fig : obs ] we show some iris raster images and individual spectra of locations with emission in the triplet lines .",

    "they are most easily seen in emission in flares and other high - energy phenomena where there is heating in the lower chromosphere .",
    "@xcite find that the triplet lines are often in emission in ellerman bombs @xcite , and they are also seen in emission in some of the explosive events reported by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the raster images in figure  [ fig : obs ] are taken at wavelengths close to the center of the lines at 279.88  nm , meaning that bright areas are locations of increased intensity in the lines ( in the ar and sunspot images many of these are indeed in emission , but not in the quiet sun images ) . in",
    "the ar images one sees a collection of several bright dots with a round shape where the lines are in emission ",
    "these generally occur in the vicinity of sunspots , and it is possible that they are related to ellerman bombs . but as shown in the sunspot panel , there is also strong triplet emission ( and strong  emission ) in the light bridge . in some of these ar locations",
    "the  lines have an intensity very close to the average , while the triplet lines are strongly enhanced ( see the extreme example in the sunspot spectrum where the lines at 279.8  nm are stronger than the k line ) . such scenarios could indicate an abrupt temperature rise only in the lower chromosphere , not felt by the  line centers .",
    "other locations show both the triplet lines and the  lines strongly enhanced , which could be caused by a temperature increase throughout a wider range of the chromosphere ( e.g. in flares ) .    in the quiet sun ,",
    "emission in the triplet lines is seldom found . from several datasets",
    "investigated , it was found only in very few of them . and even when found , it is rarely of the same magnitude as seen in ars . most often , this quiet sun emission is on the far wings of the line , with the central part of the line resembling its typical absorption profile .",
    "this is consistent with what we found in the quiet sun simulation , and suggests that in these locations the heating is limited to a deep area near the temperature minimum .",
    "another piece of corroborating evidence for this scenario is that the  lines are also noticeably wider than the average , an indication that the /features are being formed lower down in the atmosphere as a result of the chromospheric temperature increase taking place deeper than usual .",
    "this is the case with the quiet sun profiles that we show  the triplet lines are in emission only in the wings , and the  are wider than normal .",
    "these locations also show an enhanced photospheric temperature , as evidenced by the high local continuum .",
    "we have studied the formation of the  triplet of lines that lie near the  lines . the lower levels of these subordinate lines are the upper levels of the  lines . to understand their formation we use a forward modeling approach , making use of realistic 3d radiative mhd simulations and comparing the predicted spectra with the physical quantities from the simulation .    in the quiet sun , we find that the lines are formed just above the temperature minimum , at heights around @xmath16  mm above @xmath7 , or at column masses down to @xmath70 .",
    "the lines can be used as velocity indicators for those layers , but the line pair at 279.88  nm is problematic because of the overlapping lines .",
    "the source functions of these lines typically decouple from the local temperature before the chromospheric temperature rise , and therefore the source function decreasing with height gives rise to absorption lines , by far the most common scenario .",
    "however , under particular circumstances the lines go into emission , and this can be a powerful diagnostic .    when a large temperature increase is present in the lower chromosphere the source functions can follow this increase , leading to emission lines . from the simulations we find that this typically happens when",
    "there is a temperature increase of more than 1500  k in layers with column masses from 1 to @xmath71 , and an electron density above @xmath72 .",
    "in addition , one can use the ratio of the emission peak to the local continuum of the lines to derive a rough estimation of the temperature difference that caused that same emission .",
    "this holds true for both quiet sun and more violent flaring simulations , and means that the lines can be used to diagnose steep temperature increases in the lower chromosphere , a new type of diagnostic complementary to those of the  lines @xcite .",
    "the shape of the emission line also provides information about the underlying physical quantities : in cases where the heating occurs deeper down and is covered by cooler material , the emission in the triplet lines occurs predominantly in their far wings , with the central part of the line being like a typical absorption line ( under these circumstances the  lines are also wider ) . when the heating occurs higher in the column range to which the lines are sensitive ( @xmath73 ) , the emission takes place in the line core .",
    "the  triplet lines are routinely observed by iris , and we find several example observations that confirm the scenarios seen in the synthetic spectra . as in the quiet sun simulation , emission is very rare in the quiet sun , and when it happens it tends to be in the far wings of the lines , suggesting heating occurring deeper in the chromosphere .",
    "the lines are more easily observed in emission in flares , active regions , and in particular near sunspots and features like ellerman bombs , as has already been reported . in such locations",
    "the lines can be strongly enhanced , in some extreme cases even stronger than the  lines . with the help from the simulations",
