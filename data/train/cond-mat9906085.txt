    "large random reactance networks ( that is networks made of random mixture of capacitances @xmath5 and inductances @xmath6 ) possess a peculiar property noticed first by dykhne @xcite : they have a finite real conductance and thus can disperse an electric power .",
    "explanation of this somewhat paradoxical property is simple , however . indeed ,",
    "if such a network is large enough there always exist circuits of `` resonance type '' , with ( purely imaginary ) conductance showing poles at some frequencies",
    ". then the real part of the conductance as a function of frequency consists of a set of @xmath7like peaks at those resonance frequencies .",
    "when the volume of the network grows to infinity , this set becomes more and more dense .",
    "then , adding an arbitrary small ( infinitesemal , but fixed ) active part to all inductances ( one may think , e.g. of the inductance @xmath6 on each bond being in series with a weak resistance r ) results in a finite active resistance of the network .",
    "a random mixture of two active conductances is very well studied in correspondence with the bond percolation problem , see e.g.@xcite . at the same time , the random reactance networks are relatively less studied .",
    "it is necessary to mention that the random @xmath0 ( more generally , @xmath8 ) networks emerge in various physical contexts .",
    "as was shown long ago by shender@xcite the conductance of the random @xmath0 network turns out to be intimately related to properties of collective excitations in spin glasses .",
    "the mapping between the two problems is possible by an analogy noticed first by kirkpatrick @xcite between the kirchhoff s law and the equation of motion for the spin operators .",
    "more recently , @xmath8 networks were claimed to be an adequate model for describing the optical absorption in disordered metal films , see @xcite and references therein , which showed some unusual features .",
    "this fact motivated luck and collaborators for a series of insightful numerical investigations of two - dimensional @xmath8 arrays @xcite .",
    "since it is the conductance poles ( resonances ) of the @xmath0 networks which dominate properties of the weakly dissipative @xmath8 networks , it is natural to try to understand their properties in a greater detail . to access those poles it is convenient , following @xcite to start with the kirchhoff equations for the electric potential at vertices @xmath9 of a network : @xmath10 where the summation goes over all vertices @xmath11 which are neighbours of a given @xmath9 .",
    "the equations eqs.([khhof ] ) should be complimented with boundary conditions at electrodes . for a two - terminal geometry",
    "one assumes @xmath12 ( resp .",
    "@xmath13 ) for the vertices @xmath9 belonging to the left ( resp .",
    "right ) terminal .",
    "it is useful to introduce the ( positive semidefinite ) laplace operator @xmath14 on the network by @xmath15 with a convention @xmath12 on both electrodes .    in a random @xmath0 network",
    "each conductance at frequency @xmath16 is equal to either @xmath17 or @xmath18 , with a specified probabilities ( in what follows we concentrate on the case of equal probability for finding @xmath6 and @xmath5 bonds in the network ) .",
    "then the laplace operator can be written as a sum @xmath19 of its components on the @xmath20 and @xmath21 bond sets , respectively .",
    "it is easy to show that the poles of the conductance occur at frequencies @xmath22 given by the roots of the equation @xcite : @xmath23 where we introduce the ratio @xmath24 with @xmath25 being a characteristic resonant frequency of the lc network .",
    "the simplest , but very informative way to understand properties of the random binary mixtures _ on average _ is to write an equation for the mean conductance @xmath26 using an effective - medium approximation ( ema ) . for a network with a coordination number @xmath27 and equal concentrations of @xmath28 and",
    "@xmath29bonds it reads as follows@xcite : @xmath30 analysing the solution of this quadratic equation as a function of @xmath31 in the interval @xmath32 , one finds that generically for @xmath33 the real part of @xmath34 is non - zero only inside some interval @xmath35 . according to the discussion above it means that a mean density of resonances is finite only inside that interval .",
    "useful and simple as it is , ema suffers from an essential drawback : it systematically neglects fluctuations , whereas taking the fluctuations into account could be important . for example , as was noted in @xcite the existence of sharp edges @xmath36 was an artifact of the ema approximation .",
    "in fact , the density of the resonances is never exactly zero inside the whole interval @xmath37 $ ] due to the so called lifshitz tails , which is a purely fluctuation phenomenon .",
    "apart from that , it seems hard to construct ema as a systematic approximation with respect to some small parameter , though there are indications that it becomes progressively exact for higher spatial dimensions @xmath38 @xcite and can be an extremely well - working one for many realistic systems @xcite .",
    "therefore , it is not clear how to correct it systematically or to include fluctuation effects into account .",
    "these unsatisfactory features should be contrasted with the status of the mean - field approximation in the theory of magnetism , with which ema shares its main ingredients . as is well known ,",
    "the mean - field equations become exact for the model with the infinite range of spin interaction . even for strongly disordered spin systems like spin glasses",
    "the latter model provides an adequate basis for constructing a mean - field theory with many non - trivial properties@xcite .",
    "it is natural to try to consider a model of similar type also for the disordered reactance networks .",
    "this just amounts to considering the kirchhoff equations eqs.([khhof ] ) on a disordered _ full - connectivity _ graph of @xmath39 vertices ( nodes ) connected by @xmath40 edges ( bonds ) , each independently taking a value @xmath41 or @xmath42 .",
    "actually , we find it convenient to consider a graph with @xmath43 nodes , among them two `` terminal '' nodes ( labeled @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively ) are singled out by being attached to external voltage , so that the potential at @xmath44 is equal to @xmath46 , whereas the potential at @xmath45 is kept zero . the rest of @xmath39 `` internal '' nodes are labeled by index @xmath47 and the corresponding ( induced ) potentials are denoted with @xmath48 .",
    "the nodes are connected in a full - connectivity graph of @xmath49 bonds , with a single bond being excluded by obvious reasons : that connecting terminals @xmath44 and @xmath45 directly , see fig.1 .",
    "we then attribute conductances @xmath50 to each bond .",
    "it is convenient to introduce three @xmath51 component vectors : @xmath52 ( we used here @xmath53 to indicate the transposition ) and @xmath54 matrix @xmath55 with the following structure : @xmath56 in these notations @xmath57 kirchhof s equations eq.([khhof ] ) ( @xmath39 for the internal nodes @xmath9 and one for the node @xmath45 ) can be written , respectively : @xmath58 where @xmath59 stands for the total current flowing outwards through the terminal node @xmath45 .",
    "this system of equations can be readily solved yielding the expression for the network conductance : @xmath60    if we now deal with a binary networks when each @xmath61 is @xmath41 with a probability @xmath62 and @xmath42 with the probability @xmath63 it is convenient to introduce the `` symmetric '' variables @xmath64 such that @xmath65 if @xmath66 and @xmath67 if @xmath68 , so that @xmath69+[\\sigma_1-\\sigma_0]h_{ij}\\right)$ ] . in terms of these variables the network conductance eq.([y ] ) can be written as : @xmath70 \\frac{1}{{\\bf h}-\\tilde{\\lambda}{\\bf w } } \\left[\\underline{h}_a-\\tilde{\\lambda}\\underline{e}\\right]\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath54 matrices @xmath72 have the following elements : @xmath73 with these expressions in hand we see that resonances of our network are determined by values of @xmath74 satisfying the condition : @xmath75    of course , it is evident that the full - connectivity construction would be completely inadequate one for describing the percolation problem which dominates properties of binary mixtures of two real conductances .",
    "we are , however , interested in studying the resonances of disordered lc networks , and the existence of such resonances is in no way precluded by `` all - to - all '' geometry .",
    "we will find , that such a model turns out to be , in essence , exactly soluable in the limit @xmath76 .",
    "we start with deriving the mean density of resonances which turns out to be a function of the scaled variable @xmath77 .",
    "one can envisage such a scaling already from the ema result eq.([ema ] ) , which for @xmath78 gives @xmath79 . at the same time , in contrast to ema the support of the spectrum in the infinite - range model does not have artificial sharp edges @xmath80 , but rather the mean spectral density @xmath81 smoothly decays to zero as long as @xmath82 as @xmath83 .",
    "more interesting is the fact , that the infinite - range model opens a possibility to study fluctuations of various quantities . in the present paper we concentrate on spectral fluctuations and , correspondingly ,",
    "study the two - point correlation function of the resonance densities .",
    "the latter turns out to be essentially the same as given by the famous wigner - dyson theory of random matrix spectra .",
    "this fact favourably agrees with overall numerical results @xcite for the resonance spectra of two - dimensional disordered @xmath0 networks .",
    "an origin of relatively small , but noticable deviations from the wigner - dyson statistics detected in @xcite remains unclear for us at the moment and could be related to @xmath84 features of the networks studied there which are not captured adequately by our infinite - ranged model .",
    "this issue deserves further investigations .    actually , finding the set of @xmath31 s satisfing eq.([pendef ] ) or eq.([reson ] ) is an example of the generalized eigenvalue problem .",
    "the combination of matrices @xmath85 or @xmath86 in this respect is known in the mathematical literature as a _ pencil of matrices_@xcite or just the matrix pencil .",
    "theory of the matrix pencils has many important applications such as e.g. vibration and bifurcation analysis in complicated structures @xcite and game theory@xcite .    at the same time",
    ", it seems that the present knowledge on statistical properties of generalized eigenvalues of the pencils of random matrices is rather scarce .",
    "the paper @xcite considers the mean number and the density of real eigenvalues for a pencil @xmath2 , with both @xmath4 and @xmath3 being matrices with all independent real entries and no symmetry conditions imposed . at the same time",
    ", our original physical problem motivates us to be interested in the pencils formed by real _",
    "matrices @xmath87 , with @xmath3 being positive definite .",
    "it is clear that @xmath88 ensures all the eigenvalues of the matrix pencils to be real ( such pencils are sometimes called in the literature the _ regular _ ones @xcite ) . indeed , in that case the generalized eigenproblem : @xmath89 is equivalent to a usual one : @xmath90 , with @xmath91 being a real symmetric matrix .",
    "the mean eigenvalue density for matrices of similar types ( when both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are random ) was studied in some generality starting from the work by marchenko and pastur , see @xcite .",
    "in fact , the mean eigenvalue density can be found for the ensemble @xmath92 , with @xmath4 being a real symmetric matrix with independent , identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "entries using a generalized version of results by pastur@xcite .",
    "we are however not aware of any systematic study of spectral correlations of regular pencils of the random matrices .",
    "this should be contrasted with a very intensive research on eigenvalues of the random matrices ( which is a particular case of @xmath93 ) performed in recent years in the domain of theoretical and mathematical physics@xcite .",
    "below we summarize the most important facts known from these studies .",
    "as is well established @xcite , the statistical properties of real eigenvalues @xmath94 of large @xmath54 self - adjoint random matrices @xmath4 are to large extent _ universal _ , i.e. independent of the details of the distributions @xmath95 of their entries .",
    "it is important to mention the existence , in general , of two different characteristic scales in the random matrix spectra : the _ global _ one and the _ local _ one .",
    "the global scale is that on which the eigenvalue density , defined as @xmath96 , changes appreciably with its argument @xmath97 when averaged over @xmath95 . for matrices",
    "whose spectrum has a finite support in the interval @xmath98 $ ] the global scale is just the length of this interval .",
    "in contrast , the local scale is that determined by the typical separation @xmath99 between neighbouring eigenvalues situated around a point @xmath97 , with the brackets standing for the statistical averaging .",
    "it is given therefore by @xmath100 .",
    "if we are interested in those values of @xmath97 that are sufficiently far from the edges of the spectra the global scale is , roughly speaking , by a factor of @xmath39 larger than the local one .",
    "in other words , the mean density @xmath101 can be considered as a constant one on the scale @xmath102 .",
    "the degree of universality is essentially dependent on the chosen scale .    as to the global scale universality",
    ", one can mention first of all that for the matrices with i.i.d .",
    "entries under quite general conditions ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) the mean density is given in the limit @xmath103 by the so - called `` wigner semicircle law '' : @xmath104 in this expression the parameter @xmath105 just sets the global scale in the sense defined above .",
    "it is determined by the expectation value @xmath106 .",
    "it is generally accepted to scale the entries @xmath107 , i.e. in such a way that @xmath105 stays finite when @xmath103 , the local spacing between eigenvalues in the neighbourhood of the point @xmath97 being therefore @xmath108 .    from the point of view of universality",
    "the semicircular eigenvalue density is not extremely robust .",
    "most easily one violates it by considering an important class of the so - called `` invariant ensembles '' characterized by a probability density of the form @xmath109 , with @xmath110 being an even polynomial .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue density turns out to be highly nonuniversal and is determined by the particular form of the potential @xmath111 . only for @xmath112",
    "it is given by the semicircular law , eq.([semi ] ) .",
    "actually , any `` deformation '' @xmath113 of the ensemble @xmath4 with i.i.d .",
    "entries by a given _ fixed _ matrix @xmath114 results in the mean eigenvalue density belonging to a family of `` deformed semicircular laws '' discovered by pastur@xcite .",
    "moreover , one can easily have a non - semicircular eigenvalue density even for real symmetric matrices @xmath115 with i.i.d .",
    "entries , if one keeps the mean number of non - zero entries @xmath62 per column to be of the order of unity when performing the limit @xmath116 .",
    "this is a characteristic feature of the so - called _ sparse _",
    "random matrices@xcite characterized by the following probability density of a given entry @xmath117 : @xmath118 where @xmath119 is an arbitrary even distribution function satisfying the conditions : @xmath120 .",
    "remarkably , a much more profound universality emerges for the two - point correlation spectral function defined as : @xmath121 where we defined the connected part of the correlation function in a usual manner : @xmath122 .",
    "the nontrivial part of the spectral correlator is called the _ cluster function _ @xmath123 .",
    "it is one of the most informative statistical measures of the spectra , @xcite .",
    "it turns out , that already the global scale behaviour of @xmath123 ( i.e. one for the distance @xmath124 being comparable with the support of the spectrum in the limit @xmath116 ) is rather universal .",
    "it is the same for all the `` invariant ensembles '' @xcite and for those with i.i.d .",
    "matrix elements@xcite and is determined only by the positions of edge points @xmath125 $ ] of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "even more interesting is the fact that universality of the correlation function eq.([cor ] ) ( as well as of all higher correlation functions ) extends to the local scale , i.e. for the distances @xmath126 comparable with @xmath102 .",
    "this fact was rigorously proved for the unitary invariant ensembles@xcite , extended to the unitary `` deformed '' ensembles@xcite and heuristically verified for other invariant ensembles@xcite as well as for the ensembles of sparse matrices@xcite .",
    "the particular form of the cluster function is different from that typical for the global scale .",
    "it is dictated in general by _ global symmetries _ of the random matrices , e.g.if they are complex hermitian or real symmetric @xcite .",
    "all specific ( nonuniversal ) properties are encoded in the value of local spacing @xmath102 . for the distances @xmath124",
    "such that @xmath127 local expressions match with the global one , the latter taken at distances @xmath128 $ ] .",
    "it turns out , that it is the _ local scale _ universality that is mostly relevant for real physical systems@xcite .",
    "namely , the statistics of highly excited bound states of _ closed _ quantum chaotic systems of quite different microscopic nature turn out to be independent of the microscopic details when sampled on the energy intervals large in comparison with the mean level separation , but smaller than the energy scale related by the heisenberg uncertainty principle to the relaxation time necessary for a classically chaotic system to reach equilibrium in phase space @xcite .",
    "moreover , the spectral correlation functions turn out to be exactly those which are provided by the theory of large random matrices on the _ local _ scale @xcite , with different symmetry classes corresponding to presence or absence of the time - reversal symmetry .    motivated by lack of general theoretical results for spectral properties of the pencils of random matrices , we start in sec.ii with considering an abstract pencil , with real symmetric @xmath4 belonging to the gaussian ensemble of random matrices with i.i.d .",
    "entries and @xmath129 being a real symmetric positive definite one with fixed given entries .",
    "we derive an expression for the mean spectral density of such a pencil and demonstrate that the correlation properties on the local scale ( in the sense defined above ) are the same as given by the wigner - dyson expressions .",
    "then , in sec.iii we extend our consideration to the case of resonance statistics in the random infinite - range lc - network , by deriving the mean density and the two - point spectral correlation function for the resonances .",
    "to study spectral properties of a regular matrix pencil @xmath2 we employ the efetov supersymmetry approach @xcite .",
    "a pedestrian introduction into the method can be found in @xcite .",
    "a convenient starting point is a representation of the spectral density @xmath130 of real eigenvalues @xmath1 for the equivalent symmetric eigenvalue problem for the matrix @xmath91 in the following form : @xmath131 which after a trivial manipulation can be rewritten as a derivative @xmath132 of a generation function @xmath133 defined as @xmath134}{\\det\\left[(\\lambda\\pm i\\epsilon){\\bf w}-{\\bf h}\\right]}\\ ] ] in a completely analogous way one expresses the two - point spectral correlation function ( `` cluster function '' , see eq.([cor ] ) ) : @xmath135 as @xmath136\\ ] ] where the angular brackets stand for the ensemble averaging and we assume that @xmath137 .",

    "a @xmath144 diagonal supermatrix @xmath145 takes care of absence of the source @xmath146 in the denomenator of the generating function eq([genfunc ] ) .",
    "since we are dealing finally with the averaged product of two such generating functions it is convenient to introduce the @xmath147component supervectors @xmath148 and finally @xmath149 as well as the supermatrices @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "it is also useful to remember that we expect to have non - trivial spectral correlations on the scale comparable with the mean spacing between neigbouring eigenvalues , i.e. when @xmath152 .",
    "correspondingly , we introduce : @xmath153 and consider @xmath154 to be of the order of unity henceforth .",
    "all this allows us to write the product of two generating functions as @xmath155\\otimes { \\bf w}\\phi\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this expression can be easily averaged over the gaussian distribution of @xmath4 by the chain of identities : @xmath156}\\ ] ] where @xmath105 determines the variance of matrix elements of @xmath4 , see eq.([semi ] ) and @xmath157 .",
    "the last relation trading the term in the exponent quartic with respect to @xmath158 for an auxilliary integration over the set of supermatrices @xmath159 is known as the hubbard - stratonovich transformation and plays a cornerstone role in the whole method . after substituting eq.([hst ] ) back into averaged eq.([genprod ] ) and changing the order of integrations one performs the ( gaussian ) integral over @xmath158 explicitly .",
    "it turns out that in order to justify all these operations formally one has to restrict the supermatrices @xmath159 to a manifold paramatrized as @xmath160 , with @xmath161 being a block - diagonal hermitian supermatrix and @xmath162 belonging to a certain graded coset space @xmath163 . a detailed discussion of this fact and an explicit parametrisation of the matrices @xmath162 could be found in @xcite .",
    "the resulting expression for the averaged product of the generation functions turns out to be dependent only on eigenvalues @xmath164 of the matrix @xmath3 ( this fact can be traced back to the `` rotational invariance '' of the gaussian orthogonal ensemble ( goe ) formed by @xmath4 ) and has the following form : @xmath165}\\ ] ] where @xmath166 .",

    "in other words , we could restrict ourselves by terms linear in sources @xmath169 in the expansion eq.([e0 ] ) above .",
    "we will make use of this fact later on when considering a more complicated situation in the next section .",

    "we mention only a few most important moments .",
    "first of all the integral in eq.([meand ] ) is given by the so - called psew ( parisi - sourlas - efetov - wegner ) theorem due to a specific symmetry of the integrand ( in the limit @xmath183 the integrand contains only a part of the integration variables due to the projector @xmath184 ) the resulting mean eigenvalue density is merely given by : @xmath185 the system of equations eqs([sys],[denav ] ) turns out to be in fact equivalent to a particular case of general results by pastur and girko@xcite .    substituting the expression eq.([denav ] ) for the mean spectral density to eqs.([pree ] ) and the resulting formulae further to the integral eq.([tprep],[act ] ) for the averaged generating function one can express the `` connected '' part of the two - point correlation function @xmath186 as : @xmath187 { \\mathop{\\mathrm{str}}}\\left[\\hat{t}^{-1}\\hat{\\lambda}\\hat{t}\\hat{k } \\frac{\\hat{1}-\\hat{\\lambda}}{2}\\right ] \\exp\\left\\{-\\frac{i\\pi \\rho(\\lambda)}{4}s { \\mathop{\\mathrm{str}}}\\left[\\hat{t}^{-1}\\hat{\\lambda}\\hat{t}\\hat{\\lambda}\\right ] \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath188 being an appropriate invariant measure on the coset space .",
    "when deriving that expression from eqs.([tprep],[act],[pree ] ) we noticed that the `` disconnected '' part of the correlation function is again given by psew theorem and cancels exactly the contribution from those few terms in the integrand which are not proportional to the mean density @xmath130 .",
    "the expression eq.([con ] ) is our main result and is quite remarkable : its form exactly coincides with the corresponding expression for the two - point correlation function of random matrices from goe , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "this fact was first demonstrated by efetov who managed to perform a non - trivial integration over the coset - space explicitly@xcite and found that it reproduced the famous dyson expression@xcite for the two - point function@xcite : @xmath189 where @xmath190 is a spectral distance @xmath191 measured in units of the local mean spacing @xmath192 $ ] .    in the end of the present section we just mention that our method of deriving eq.([con ] )",

    "suppose we have a @xmath229 component supervector @xmath230 like that defined in eq.([suvec1 ] ) and consider a function @xmath231 vanishing on the boundary of integration .",
    "then it is easy to verify that : @xmath232 the first identity being just a particular case of the psew theorem mentioned in the previous section , see e.g.@xcite .    for further analysis",
    "it is very important that a solution for the system eq.([system ] ) exists for arbitrary @xmath233 such that @xmath234 .",
    "we will see later on that the mean density of resonances is merely given by @xmath235 . for @xmath236",
    "one can easily infer from eqs.([system ] ) that @xmath237 developes a gaussian tail : @xmath238 it is necessary to mention that the equations eq.([system ] ) virtually coincide with those emerging in a study of density of eigenvalues of a transition matrix on a randomly diluted graph in a limit of large connectivity performed by bray and rodgers@xcite , see their eqs.(20),(21 ) and fig.1 in their paper .",
    "indeed two problems have many common features , and the coincidence is hardly accidental .",
    "an indication of a relation between the problems comes from the structure of the matrix @xmath239 , see eq.([defin ] ) , which is actually very similar to the structure of the matrix considered by bray and rodgers .",

    "it is simple to satisfy oneself that @xmath253 , and the same obviosly holds for the whole manifold @xmath254 .",
    "therefore , the only term that renders the expression for the generation function to be non - trivial is @xmath255 . in the limit",
    "@xmath256 we can expand eq.([zdec1 ] ) as : @xmath257\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we introduced a supermatrix : @xmath258 and used that fact , that it is enough for our purposes to keep only terms linear with respect to the source matrix @xmath259 ( see the discussion after eq.([e2 ] ) ) .    to determine the matrix elements of @xmath260 it is convenient to use the equation : @xmath261 which follows from the saddle - point equation eq.([fsp ] ) and eq.([ansatz ] ) .",

    "here we assumed an infinitesemal negative imaginary part to be included in @xmath154 . remembering that @xmath271 and making the correspondence : @xmath272 we see that the obtained expression literally coincides @xcite with the averaged generation function derived in the previous section , that means with the generating function eq.([genave ] ) after restricting the integration to the saddle - point manifold eq.([spm ] ) and expanding with respect to source terms . since that generating function underlied the expressions eqs.([con ] ) for the two - point spectral correlation function as well as the expression eq.([meand ] ) for the mean spectral density , we immediately extract those quantities for our actual problem .",
    "as we already mentioned above , the mean resonance density is given by @xmath235 , and the functional form of the spectral correlation function is given by the same wigner - dyson expression as before , see eq.([dyson ] ) , provided one uses @xmath81 for the actual mean resonance density .",

    "actually , the fact that @xmath158 is a supervector rather than a usual vector is of little importance for our consideration , so one may think about it as a usual vector ( or even scalar ) .",
