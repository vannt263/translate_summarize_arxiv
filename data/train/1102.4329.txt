    "the inferred most probable redshift @xmath46 ( based on uv - nir data ) is close to the spectroscopically determined redshift of @xmath52 , and supported by the fir - radio data .",

    "in  we show the sed of aztec  1 . fixing the redshift to @xmath46 ( )",
    "we fit the uv - nir sed using various model spectrum libraries . for each model",
    "we compute the total @xmath43 and define the most probable parameter values and their errors from the probability distribution function . using the @xcite library ( see @xcite for details ) the uv - nir sed is best described by a @xmath53  myr old starburst with @xmath54 , an extinction of @xmath55  mag , and a stellar mass of @xmath56 ( see top panel in ) .",

    "taking @xmath78  ( k  pc@xmath75)@xmath79 ( downes & solomon 1998 ) implies @xmath3 gas mass upper limits of @xmath80  ( @xmath76 ) and @xmath81  @xmath82 ) . turning the arguments around , i ) assuming a typical @xmath83 conversion ( riechers et al .",
    "2006 ) the fir luminosity inferred here for aztec  1 , @xmath70  , yields an expected co luminosity of @xmath84  k  pc@xmath75 , and ii ) assuming a gas - to - dust - ratio of 50 - 150 ( e.g.  calzetti et al.2000 ) , and @xmath78  ( k  pc@xmath75)@xmath79 the dust mass we inferred here for aztec  1 ( @xmath69  ) translates into a line luminosity of @xmath85  k  pc@xmath75 .",
    "such a gas reservoir should have been detected ( especially with the more sensitive pdbi observations ) within our interferometric observations in the 3  mm band .",
    "below we discuss a few possibilities why the co(5@xmath254 ) line was not detected .",
    "first , it is possible that the systemic redshift of the source is outside the bandwidth range covered with our interferometric observations ( encompassing redshift ranges of @xmath86 and @xmath87 ) .",
    "our uv - nir analysis of the sed yields a 68% probability that the redshift of the source is within @xmath88 .",
    "however , we also find a second redshift peak at @xmath89 in our redshift probability distribution ( see ) .",
    "furthermore , the systemic ( co ) redshift of the source is not necessarily expected to coincide with the one inferred from uv - nir data ( typical velocity offsets are several hundred  for narrow - line objects ) .",
    "thus , it is possible that the co redshift is outside the range covered by our interferometric observations .",
    "note however , that if this were the case , it would not significantly alter the results of our sed analysis ( ) .",
    "alternatively , assuming the systemic redshift is within the covered bandwidth , the co(5@xmath254 ) non - detection could be explained by a low co - excitation resulting in a low line brightness of the co(5@xmath254 ) transition . assuming a co 5@xmath254 to 1@xmath250 line brightness temperature ratio of @xmath90 , as found for the @xmath14 smg gn20 @xcite , the pdbi @xmath3 limit in the co(1@xmath250 ) line is @xmath91  k  pc@xmath75 .",
    "this is roughly consistent with the co - fir relation .",
    "furthermore , an uncertainty of a factor of a few in the inferred dust mass ( including possible agn heating ) and the @xmath92 conversion factor makes this limit also roughly consistent with @xmath93 estimated from aztec  1 s dust mass .",
    "thus , a low co - excitation in aztec  1 may explain the non - detection of co(5@xmath254 ) .",
    "our analysis of the uv - radio sed of aztec  1 implies that aztec  1 is an extremely young and massive galaxy , forming stars at a rate of @xmath10  at @xmath94 .",
    "in general , vigorous star formation induces strong negative feedback that can terminate ( and then self - regulate ) the starburst by dispersing and expelling gas from the gravitational potential well ( elmegreen 1999 ; scoville 2003 ; thompson et al .  2005 ; riechers et al .",
    "this sets a number of physical limits on the starburst .",
    "assuming that a ) the maximum intensity of a radiation - pressure supported starburst is determined by the eddington limit for dust , b ) a constant gas - to - dust ratio with radius , and c ) that the disk is self - regulated ( i.e.  toomre @xmath95 ) such an eddington limited starburst will have a sfr surface density @xmath96  , a fir luminosity surface density @xmath97  kpc@xmath98 , and an effective temperature of 88  k ( see eqs .",
    "33 - 36 in thompson et al .",
    "2005 ) .",
    "a sfr of @xmath10  in aztec  1 ( based on the nuv - nir sed fit ) then implies a sfr surface density of @xmath99  ( assuming @xmath100  kpc based on sma imaging ; younger et al.2008 ) .",
    "the inferred value does not violate the eddington limited starburst models .",
    "the fir luminosity surface density in aztec  1 , @xmath101  kpc@xmath79 , and the dust temperature of @xmath102  k support that the starburst in aztec  1 is consistent , but not in violation of its eddington limit .",
    "it is noteworthy that the inferred value of the sfr surface density for aztec  1 is somewhat higher compared to smgs at @xmath6 , which typically have @xmath103  ( tacconi et al .",
    "2006 ) , pointing to the compactness of the star formation region in aztec  1 .",
    "tacconi  et  al .",
    "have shown that @xmath6 smgs are well described within a starburst picture ( elmegreen 1999 ) in which star formation can not self - regulate and thus a significant fraction of gas is converted into stars in only a few times the dynamical timescale .",
    "continuing this line of reasoning we make use of a detailed hydrodynamical study of matter deposition in young assembling galaxies performed by silich et al .",
    "we estimate that aztec  1 is forming stars in a gravitationally bound regime in which gravity prohibits the formation of a superwind , leading to matter accumulation within the galaxy and further generations of star formation . specifically , silich et al.show that there are three hydrodynamic regimes that develop in starbursting galaxies : i ) generation of a superwind , that expels matter from the star forming region , ii ) a gravitationally bound regime , in which gravity prohibits the formation of a superwind and contains the matter within the galaxy , and iii ) an intermediate , bimodal regime .",
    "the specific regime is dependent on the sfr and the size of the star formation region in the galaxy ( see fig .  1 in silich et al .",
    "2010 ) . taking the size of the star forming region in aztec  1 to be @xmath35  kpc @xcite , its @xmath104  yields that , consistent with scuba detected galaxies , aztec  1 is forming stars in the gravitationally bound regime .    in summary , our analysis of the properties of aztec  1 points to an extremely young and massive galaxy , forming stars at a rate of @xmath10  at @xmath94 .",
    "we find that it has already assembled a stellar mass of @xmath105  , in a region covering only @xmath106  kpc in total extent ( based on hst and sma imaging ; see younger et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) yielding that aztec  1 is a compact massive galaxy at @xmath94 .",
    "the high stellar mass and compactness of aztec  1 resemble that of a recently identified population of quiescent , passively evolving , already massive ( typically @xmath107  ) , but compact galaxies at @xmath6 ( e.g.  van dokkum et al .",
    "2008 ) deemed to evolve into the most massive red - and - dead galaxies at @xmath108 .",
    "the upper gas mass limit inferred for aztec  1 ( although quite uncertain ) is @xmath109  . if aztec  1 continues to form stars at the current rate it will deplete the available gas in @xmath110  myr ( assuming 100% efficiency ) . unless further gas is supplied and high levels of star formation are induced the galaxy s stellar body will have time to age and redden till @xmath111 .",
    "the surface density of the ( likely still incomplete ) sample of three confirmed @xmath14 smgs in the aztec - cosmos field ( 0.3  deg@xmath75 ) is @xmath112  deg@xmath98 .",
    "this is already higher than @xmath113  deg@xmath98 predicted by semi - analytic models of structure growth ( e.g. baugh et al .",
    "2005 ; see also coppin et al .",
    "2009 , 2010 ) . thus , further studies of @xmath14 smgs are key to understand the smg population ( e.g. wall et al .",
    "2008 ) and its cosmological role .",
    "based on uv - fir observations of aztec  1 , and a keck  ii / deimos spectrum , we have shown that aztec  1 is a @xmath70  starburst at @xmath0 ( with a secondary , less likely , redshift probability peak at @xmath89 ) . based on our revised fir values",
    "we find that aztec  1 fits comfortably within the limits of a maximal starburst , and that it forms stars in a gravitationally bound regime which traps the gas within the galaxy leading to formation of new generations of stars .",
    "our sed analysis yields that aztec  1 is an extremely young ( @xmath7  myr ) , massive ( @xmath8  ) , but compact ( @xmath9  kpc ) galaxy forming stars at a rate of @xmath10  at @xmath46 .",
    "these interesting properties suggest that aztec  1 may be a candidate of progenitors of quiescent , already massive , but very compact galaxies regularly found at @xmath6 , and thought to evolve into the most massive , red - and - dead galaxies found in the local universe .",

    "<S> based on broad / narrow - band photometry and keck deimos spectroscopy we report a redshift of @xmath0 for aztec / cosmos  1 , the brightest sub - mm galaxy in the aztec / cosmos field . </S>",
    "<S> in addition to the cosmos - survey x - ray to radio data , we report observations of the source with herschel / pacs ( 100 , 160  @xmath1 m ) , cso / sharc  ii ( 350  @xmath1 m ) , carma and pdbi ( 3  mm ) . we do not detect co(@xmath2 ) line emission in the covered redshift ranges , 4.56 - 4.76 ( pdbi / carma ) and 4.94 - 5.02 ( carma ) . </S>",
    "<S> if the line is within this bandwidth , this sets @xmath3 upper limits on the gas mass to @xmath4  and @xmath5  , respectively ( assuming similar conditions as observed in @xmath6 smgs ) . </S>",
    "<S> this could be explained by a low co - excitation in the source . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis of the uv - ir spectral energy distribution of aztec  1 shows that it is an extremely young ( @xmath7  myr ) , massive ( @xmath8  ) , but compact ( @xmath9  kpc ) galaxy forming stars at a rate of @xmath10  . </S>",
    "<S> our results imply that aztec  1 is forming stars in a gravitationally bound regime in which gravity prohibits the formation of a superwind , leading to matter accumulation within the galaxy and further generations of star formation . </S>"
