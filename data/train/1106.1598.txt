    "the role of the multipole sqd - mnp interaction in explaining the spectra of hybrid systems has been discussed in details in ref .  .",
    "all these effects depend on both geometrical parameters and material properties of hybrid clusters providing an excellent opportunity of more fine - grained control of spectral and dynamical properties of nanoscale objects .",
    "we consider the simplest hybrid nano - cluster comprising a sqd and a spherical mnp  artificial hybrid diatomic nano - molecule .",
    "when such a system is excited optically , the dipole moment of the optical transition in the sqd generates an additional electric field at the mnp , which is superposed with the external field .",
    "similarly , the induced dipole moment of the mnp generates an additional electric field in the sqd .",
    "thus , the presence of the mnp leads to a self action ( feedback ) of the sqd . together with nonlinearity of the sqd itself , this can give rise to a variety of new optical properties .",
    "in particular , if the coupling between two nanoparticles is strong enough , the self - action can result in optical bistability of the response .",
    "note that a dimer comprised of strongly coupled two - level molecules can not manifest bistability .",
    "@xcite thus , a sqd - mnp hetero - dimer is a fascinating nanoscopic system exhibiting this feature .    to demonstrate the feasibility of the bistable optical response of hybrid composites , we consider a closely spaced cdse ( or cdse / znse ) sqd and an au nano - sphere .",
    "we show that for a range of geometrical parameters of the system ( sqd and mnp radii and center - to - center distance ) , the optical bistability and hysteresis can be observed in it .",
    "we argue also that because of the axial symmetry of such artificial diatomic molecule , its state can be switched not only by traditional change of the driving field amplitude , but also by changing the incoming field polarization with respect to the molecule axis , which offers an additional mechanism of control . the fact that both the sqd and the mnp can sustain high electric fields suggests such possible applications of artificial molecules as all - optical switches and optical memory cells at nanoscale in the visible ; the two stable states of the systems have different total dipole moments , providing a possibility to store information in this degree of freedom .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section the model and formalism are described . in sec .",
