    "it seems that with improved experimental techniques the actual border between quantum and classical worlds has been moved into larger and larger systems @xcite .",
    "the most daring challenge to the correspondence principle is the idea of macroscopic quantum systems .",
    "for example , there exists quite convincing evidence that certain macroscopic systems , like josephson junctions ( `` superconducting qubits'')@xcite , bose - einstein condensates @xcite or rydberg atoms @xcite , preserve fundamental quantum properties . on the other hand ,",
    "these arguments are strongly model - dependent and do not completely exclude the existence of an approximative classical description @xcite",
    ". therefore , model - independent tests of `` quantumness '' are of great theoretical and practical importance .",
    "this question is particularly relevant for the field of quantum information and quantum computation .",
    "a useful quantum computer should be a rather macroscopic machine which nevertheless preserves certain fundamental quantum properties .",
    "moreover , it is believed that some examples of macroscopic quantum systems can provide promising implementations of quantum information processing .    in the present paper",
    "we develop the ideas introduced in @xcite and tested experimentally for a single - photon polarization in @xcite .",
    "we discuss tests of quantumness based on certain fundamental properties of classical probability theory which are not valid in quantum theory .",
    "mathematically , these tests involve certain specific quantum observables called _ quantumness witnesses _ in analogy to _ entanglement witnesses _ @xcite .",
    "we discuss in detail the case of a single qubit and then show how the quantumness disappears for many - body systems when we restrict ourselves to additive observables only .",
    "we compare our proposal with the quantumness test related to quantum correlations ( entanglement ) and bell inequalities .",
    "we also study quantumness witnesses which appear in the context of phase space representation of a quantum oscillator .",
    "assume that our aim is to interpret a given set of experimental data in terms of a mathematical model which involves the notions of states and observables .",
    "operationally , the state @xmath0 can be identified with a fixed system s preparation procedure and the observable @xmath1 with some apparatus which produces a set of outcomes @xmath2 . repeating the given preparation procedure @xmath0 and the measurement of @xmath1 many times",
    "we obtain the probability distribution @xmath3 which allows , e.g. , to compute all moments of the observable @xmath4 therefore , a single apparatus corresponds not to a single observable but rather to the whole family of functions @xmath5 of @xmath1 which differ by a choice of a `` pointer scale '' only .",
    "we now need a mathematical model of states and observables . for simplicity",
    "we denote by the same symbols the physical states and observables and their mathematical representations .",
    "practically , we shall test only two types of models , classical and quantum .",
    "both can be unified within the mathematical scheme called the _ @xmath6-algebraic model_. however , for all practical purposes one can always think about the two simplest extreme cases - the classical algebra of complex functions @xmath7 on a `` discrete phase - space '' @xmath8 and the quantum algebra @xmath9 of @xmath10 complex matrices . a @xmath6-algebra @xmath11 is a complete complex linear space with a norm @xmath12 , adjoint operation @xmath13 and the product @xmath14 satisfying natural relations including the condition @xmath15 .",

    "the possible outcomes of the measurement of @xmath1 are given by the numbers @xmath28 and for the moments we have @xmath29 .",

    "+ there exist different definitions of hvms which are probably not equivalent from the mathematical point of view ( see the monograph @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "their common feature is the existence of a set of parameters @xmath54 ( _ hidden variables _ ) which determine all possible outcomes of experiments performed on a given system .",
    "this idea can be realised assuming that the experiments @xmath55 produce outcomes @xmath56 which are functions of the hidden variables @xmath57 .",
    "the perfect system s preparation procedure can be described by fixing the hidden variable @xmath58 which in principle may depend not only on the preparation device but also on the _ context _ , i.e. the set of observables to be measured . as we would like to model nondeterministic theories we assume that the preparation procedure is not perfect but rather given by the probability distribution on the set of hidden variables which may still depend on the context and is denoted by @xmath59 .",

    "the main problem is to design experimental tests of the `` violation of classicality '' , i.e. , an experimental proof of the existence of negative outcomes for @xmath67 and @xmath68 . within the algebraic framework",

    "one is led to conclude that the corresponding physical system preserves some genuine quantum features , as any minimal model would have to be quantum according to theorem 1 .",
    "however , one could still argue that there may exist a `` non - minimal '' classical model , with the observable @xmath133 possessing negative outcomes which are averaged out by too coarse - grained initial states ( probability distributions ) .",
    "the possibility of this alternative might be called the _",
    "minimality loophole_. in any case , notice that this latter possibility would mean that the resolution on the side of observables is ( much ) higher than the corresponding resolution on the side of initial states , and",
    "this does not seem a reasonable condition .",

    "@xmath246 ( compare with @xcite ) has an operational meaning as a combination of measurable correlations @xmath247 in this case the bell observable is related to the quantumness witness @xmath68 by the expression @xmath248 [ b_1 , b_2]\\ , \\label{bellwit}\\ ] ] which provides an interesting relation between bell inequality , qw and the heisenberg uncertainty relations ( compare with @xcite for bell inequalities vs entanglement witnesses ) .",
    "the presented examples of quantumness witnesses suggest a certain generalization of this idea .",
    "take two observables described by self - adjoint operators @xmath249 and @xmath250 with the spectra @xmath251 and @xmath252 respectively .    an observable @xmath253 written as an ( ordered )",
    "polynomial or power series of @xmath254 is a qw if it possesses at least one negative eigenvalue and the function @xmath255 obtained by the replacement of operators by real numbers , @xmath256 , @xmath257 in @xmath258 is positive , i.e. @xmath259 for all @xmath260 and @xmath261 .",
    "the previously introduced qw of the form @xmath65 satisfies this definition taking @xmath262 and @xmath263 with @xmath264 and @xmath265 .",
    "indeed , @xmath266 possesses a negative eigenvalue and @xmath267 for @xmath268 .",
    "the same holds for qw of the type @xmath79 with the identification @xmath269 , @xmath270 .",
    "another class of quantumness witnesses is related to phase - representations of quantum mechanics in terms of coherent states and the so - called _ p - representation _ @xcite .",
    "consider a single quantum oscillator with the canonical pair of observables @xmath271 , the annihilation operator @xmath272 satisfying @xmath273 =   i\\ , [ a , a^{\\dagger}]= 1 \\label{qp}\\ ] ] and the family of coherent vectors @xmath274 with the normalisation and completeness conditions @xmath275 any density matrix @xmath0 can be represented by a function ( distribution ) on the phase - space denoted by @xmath276 and such that ( p - representation ) @xmath277 the _ dequantisation _ map for the states @xmath278 is linear but does not preserve positivity . therefore , the function @xmath279 is called quasi - probability distribution and the states which have positive @xmath280 can be considered as `` classical '' at least with respect to this particular phase - space representation .",
    "we now construct a whole family of qws in the form of a series @xmath281 such that the function @xmath282 and @xmath283 possesses at least one negative eigenvalue . obviously , for any classical state @xmath0 @xmath284 and hence @xmath283 detects certain `` non - classical '' states .",
    "a simple example is provided as the observable @xmath285 with @xmath286 defined by @xmath287 with @xmath288 , @xmath289 .",
    "it is a phase - space qw because @xmath285 has negative eigenvalues corresponding to the eigenvectors @xmath290 of @xmath215 with @xmath291 .",
    "motivated by the idea of entanglement witnesses we have introduced special types of quantum observables called quantumness witnesses ( qw ) . the main feature of a qw is that for any state which is considered in a given context as `` classical '' its mean value is positive but nevertheless its spectrum contains at least one negative eigenvalue .",
    "the notion of classicality is understood here in a very practical and `` contextual '' sense .",
    "namely , we assume that we have at our disposal a restricted set of experimental data which we want to interpret in terms of sets of accessible states and observables within a classical or quantum model .",
    "a properly chosen qw can provide an experimental test which detects among the accessible states those which can not be described by a classical model .",
    "the necessary condition is the possibility of computing the average of the qw using experimental data .",
    "a natural application of this idea is the implementation of quantum information processing .",
    "devices designed for quantum information processing must work in the quantum regime and therefore violation of classicality described in terms of qws could be the first experimental test of their usefulness .",
