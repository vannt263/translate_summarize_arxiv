    "the thermal structure and radiative transfer within the atmospheres of ultracool dwarfs and extrasolar planets ultimately depends upon an entire suite of molecular and atomic opacities relevant to the the temperatures and pressures found in these objects .",

    "we briefly summarize our current suite of molecular opacities that we depend upon in our modeling and consider some relevant issues in their construction .",
    "we also report on the chemical equilibrium calculation used to compute molecular abundances .",
    "although less commonly used than in the past , some calculations , particularly of planetary evolution , utilize rosseland ( @xmath0 ) or planck ( @xmath1 ) mean opacities ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "canonically , rosseland mean opacities are the appropriate choice for radiative transfer models of optically thick atmospheric regions where radiation propagates by diffusion , whereas planck mean opacities are the appropriate choice in optically thin regions @xcite . by their nature ,",
    "mean opacities are sensitive to the sum of the relevant opacity sources involved in their computation",
    ". changes both in molecular and atomic abundances and in the individual opacity sources themselves can impact the final product . here",
    "we present improved calculations for both the abundance of atoms used in our equation of state and new calculations for the relevant opacity sources .",
    "the best available data defining the ` solar abundance ' of the atoms has evolved over time as understanding of the sun s atmospheric composition has improved .",
    "here we employ solar and scaled solar metallicities that use the recently revised abundances presented in @xcite .",
    "the chemical equilibrium gas compositions computed as a function of temperature and total pressure take condensate formation and condensate settling into clouds into account in the calculation of the chemical equilibrium as is appropriate for the conditions in brown dwarfs , extrasolar giant planets and cool stars",
    ". however we purposefully neglect grain opacity in the calculation of the rosseland and planck means .",
    "we emphasize that the results here do not apply to lower - gravity environments such as proto - planetary disks because there the condensation chemistry , and therefore the gas chemistry , is significantly different than that in gravitationally bound atmospheres of substellar objects @xcite .    to compute mean opacities , we calculated a new set of molecular and atomic opacities on a grid of 324 pressure and temperature points ranging from 75 to 4000k and @xmath2 to @xmath3 ( @xmath4 to 300 bar ) .",
    "every atomic and molecular line opacity in our database of 10 different gaseous species was included , and not simply a sampling .",
    "these opacities were computed on a fixed wavenumber grid that completely resolved individual line profiles .",
    "these opacities were then combined with collision induced absorption due to interactions of hydrogen and helium as well as several other opacity sources .",
    "this new set of mean opacities uses the latest physical information including new terms due to alkali atoms that were not included in previous investigations .",
    "condensate opacity is not included in the mean opacities presented here because condensate opacities depend on the particulars of cloud models chosen to model substellar atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and may very greatly , depending upon the actual thermal structure in a given situation . because we neglect grain opacity ,",
    "the opacities presented here should be regarded as a lower limit to the true opacity , which may be several orders of magnitude higher .",
    "the grain free results are of interest as they highlight the important role of the alkali elements and isolate assumptions regarding the grain opacity .",
    "recent tabulations of mean opacities include the work by lenzuni et al .",
    "( 1991 ) for a zero metallicity gas and ferguson et al .",
    "tabulations from the latter work generally include opacity of solid condensates but a few cases without grains are also presented .",
    "we compare our results to the latter work over the relatively limited region of overlap .",
    "no other pure gaseous opacity tables are readily available for solar metallicity over our temperature and pressure regime .",
    "we discuss the opacity sources and methods for treating line broadening in section 2 . in section 3",
    "we discuss our chemical equilibrium calculation .",
    "mean opacities are presented and discussed in section 4 .",
    "we maintain a large and constantly updated database of molecular and atomic opacities .",
    "some of the opacities are from standard sources , such as the hitran database , while others are a mixture of standard and other sources . in this section",
    "we discuss the opacity sources we employ for each molecule of interest .",
    "sharp and burrows ( 2007 ) recently published a thorough discussion of molecular opacities for ultracool dwarfs and discuss which species are of greatest interest for modeling these objects .",
    "we refer the reader to that work for more extensive background discussions than are included here . furthermore , several of the molecular and atomic opacity tabulations that they review are also employed by our group .",
    "thus for a number of opacity sources we simply defer to their discussion .",
    "in other cases , particularly for @xmath5 , our opacity line list is unique and we discuss it in some detail .    given a list of atomic transitions , it is further necessary to compute a line shape for each atomic or molecular line .",
    "thus in section 2.2 we discuss our choices for molecular line shapes and pressure broadening .      in this section",
    "we discuss the molecules for which we compute opacities ( although many more species are included in the chemical equilibrium calculation ) .",
    "the selection of molecules is dictated by the chemistry in solar - composition brown dwarf and extrasolar giant planet atmospheres , and , to some extent , the availability of line data .",
    "our list includes the most important opacity sources at the temperatures appropriate to our calculations as validated by observations of cool stars , brown dwarfs , and giant planets .",
    "we do not include certain sources that affect only the far uv portion of the spectra as our high temperature cutoff is currently 4000 k.    most spectroscopic databases are built upon measurements taken at or near room temperature , and theoretical calculations supply the missing transitions that can become important at high temperatures .",
    "if only room temperature databases are used , the transitions from highly excited energy levels ( usually referred to as hot bands in the literature ) would be missing and the true opacity at elevated temperatures would be substantially underestimated .",
    "whenever possible , we use expanded databases here .    note that all references to hitran are to the hitran database .",
    "the hitran website provides the latest , updated data and copies of all the papers that give details on each molecule included .",
    "* @xmath6 : the two most extensive line lists for water are those of partridge and schwenke ( 1997 ) and barber et al .",
    "both are computational lists with hundreds of millions of lines .",
    "we have made extensive comparisons between the two lists and find that over the temperature range relevant to brown dwarf and extrasolar planet atmospheres , the differences are slight .",
    "we utilize the former list here , supplemented with lines for minor isotopes ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) from hitran .",
    "the entire database includes about @xmath9 lines .",
    "line widths are computed using @xmath10 broadening data from gamache @xcite ; a recent paper @xcite discusses possible problems with the current implementation of this theory for some other molecules .",
    "however , the few examples shown in the ma et al .",
    "paper only cover hf broadened by hf or @xmath11 . the data for @xmath12 broadening showed little differences from the earlier theory , leading us to have some confidence in our approach until data is available for @xmath10 broadening of @xmath13 .",
    "+ we note that allard et al .",
    "@xcite considered the completeness of the schwenke h@xmath14o ( and tio ) databases at high temperature and concluded that the water database still lacked transitions from high vibrational energy levels needed for calculating models of m stars and proposed that a then preliminary ( and never , to the best of our knowledge , publicly released ) database by the tennyson group was superior for these purposes . however , as discussed above the latest release of the h@xmath14o database from the tennyson group @xcite no longer shows a significant difference with the earlier schwenke result at these temperatures .",
    "* @xmath5 : the laboratory analysis of the methane spectrum is incomplete and is unlikely to be completed from laboratory measurements alone .",
    "the difficulties arise from the high degree of symmetry of the molecule , which causes a great number of the bands to overlap , and the fact that the average line separation is generally less than the doppler width at room temperature .",
    "+ the hitran methane database is not a true high temperature database because many bands originating from higher vibrational levels are not included .",
    "instead our line lists for @xmath15 and @xmath16 were generated using the latest spherical top data system ( stds ) software @xcite from the group at the university of bourgogne which allows us to calculate methane spectra to much higher total angular momentum value , @xmath17 , than tabulated in hitran .",
    "for the calculations reported here we computed to a maximum rotational level of @xmath18 , which likely covers lines of importance in cool objects .",
    "homeier et al .",
    "@xcite also used the stds software , but only calculated up to @xmath19 .",
    "for our calculation one band of @xmath16 that is missing in the bourgogne list was added from hitran and @xmath20 was included from hitran .",
    "extensive line width data for all bands is not available so we separated the available information by reference to the vibrational symmetry of the transitions and applied it to all bands @xcite .",
    "there are about @xmath21 total @xmath5 lines in the database .",
    "figure 1 compares our computed hot methane opacity at 1000 k and @xmath22 to an opacity computed solely from hitran data , both without any @xmath20 .",
    "there is generally good agreement near band centers and the computational database clearly provides important additions in regions where the hitran data are lacking .",
    "+ both our database generated from the stds software and hitran do not extend to wavenumbers much higher than about 6400 @xmath23 ( although many weak lines due to the @xmath24 band extend up to 10000 @xmath23 ) .",
    "we thus supplement the numerical line database with a continuum opacity derived from laboratory data by strong @xcite even though the experimental results are not available at elevated temperatures .",
    "this situation is unlikely to improve until new theoretical predictions are available for @xmath5 .",
    "the currently available laboratory data for bands above 6400 @xmath23 remained unanalyzed , in part because of lack of knowledge of the detailed energy levels of the transitions . + recently leggett et al .",
    "( 2007 ) compared our model spectra produced with the methane line list described above to the spectra of late type t dwarfs .",
    "they found that the models still provide a poor match to observed spectra near @xmath25 , where the models show too much flux .",
    "this is just the region where the calculated hot methane line list effectively ends except for the few very high @xmath17 lines that extend to shorter wavelengths .",
    "we note that the cia opacity of @xmath26 ( see below ) is predicted to vary rapidly with wavelength ( by about a factor of 2 ) in this region .",
    "thus , the inability to match the observations in this region could be ascribed either to the lack of good methane data , problems in the cia simulations , or some combination of the two factors .",
    "it is also conceivable , but unlikely , that some other opacity source could also be missing from the models in this region .",
    "further improvements to the methane opacity data will eventually resolve this problem .",
    "* @xmath27 : for ammonia we rely on the line list from hitran supplemented with additional measurements , not yet fully analyzed , made at room temperature .",
    "these additional lines are in the 6600 - 7000 @xmath23 region and are from the @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the @xmath30 bands @xcite . only line strengths at @xmath31 and estimated values for the lower energy level are available for these bands .",
    "the final line list has about 34,000 lines .",
    "line widths are computed as arising 90% from collisions with @xmath10 and 10% with he ( from work by nemchikov as reported in brown ( 2000 ) ) .",

    "the list includes 55,300 lines , but again no width data are available and it was estimated .      as noted previously , we compute the opacity on a fine , fixed wavenumber grid .",
    "we add the opacity arising from each individual molecular line ( hence , ` line by line ' ) using a program that takes information for each molecular absorber from a database that contains line strengths and positions , the lower energy level and line broadening information .",
    "the line profiles are generated from the line database with a voigt profile algorithm ; at higher pressures the profile are essentially lorentzian .",
    "we neglect the problem of how to treat the shape of the far line wings , where it is known @xcite that the line shape should eventually become sub - lorentzian . in most cases actual measurements , particularly at the higher pressures , are lacking and in many cases only a few theoretical predictions are available for selected bands .",
    "we make no attempt to simulate the specialized line shapes that are appropriate in the far ir and microwave regions ( see * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion in the context of jupiter s deep atmosphere ) .",
    "the line shapes in these regions are expected to be asymmetric , but because of the large overlap of the low and high frequency wings due to the high density of lines , the effects due to the deviation of the line shape from a lorentzian will tend to average out and should not cause a significant change in the integrated values of the mean opacities",
    ".    likewise we neglect @xmath45 factors @xcite which describe the deviation of the line wings from a pure lorenztian form .",
    "this includes effects such as line mixing and line narrowing , for example .",
    "some information is available for selected species on the deviation of line shapes from a lorentzian , but in many cases these studies have covered only a single band of a given molecular species , and the broadening agent was usually some mixture of @xmath11 and @xmath46 instead of @xmath10 and he which would be the appropriate choice for brown dwarfs and giant planets . after conducting a number of tests",
    ", we found that the inclusion of a @xmath47 factor for @xmath13 , a major source of opacity , had no substantive effect on the rosseland mean results .",
    "considering all the other sources of uncertainty , we did not include @xmath45 factors in this study .",
    "the collisional ( pressure broadened ) line widths for several of the species used in our opacity calculations are not well known . in general , there have been no measurements reported in the literature and in many cases the main information about the line positions and intensities that we use comes from theoretical predictions .",
    "one could estimate , in principle , the line widths in comparison to other molecules by examining the relative values of the molecular polarizabilities @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , even this information is not available to us for many species of interest . it might be possible to again estimate some of these polarizabilities by quantum mechanical calculations but again this data is not currently available . for the one case that can be compared to measurements , namely @xmath41 , the large relative value of the static polarizability compared to other molecules in our list does correlate well with",
    "the rather large line widths actually measured @xcite .",
    "currently , we simply use estimates for the line widths of @xmath43 and the metal hydrides that are @xmath48 larger than the line widths for other molecules that are earlier in the periodic table and generally have smaller effective radii when they are formed into molecules .    as a check on the effect of uncertainties in the line broadening for the various metal compounds , we calculated a set of @xmath43 opacities with twice the assumed value of the pressure broadening widths .",
    "a direct comparison shows no significant effect on the overall mean opacity .",
    "the total value of the absorption is conserved over the line profile as it should be , assuming that the line wings are allowed to extend to larger values at higher pressures .",
    "the overall effect of broader lines is to smooth out the central peaks of the absorption lines and to fill in the low points in the far wings .",
    "since the doubled widths approach the largest measured values for any molecule in our study ( @xmath41 ) , it is apparent that line width uncertainties of a factor of 2 are not a significant source of error in our calculations .",
    "the remaining line broadening parameters were taken from the literature when available .",
    "available information can include actual measurements or theoretical predictions . in a few cases ,",
    "no experimental or theoretical data of any kind for @xmath10 and he broadening was available so estimates of the line width were made . in several cases data",
    "was available for broadening by @xmath10 and he and this was used .",
    "the assumed line broadening parameters were scaled by pressure and an assumed temperature dependence for each @xmath49 combination .",
    "this temperature dependence could come from actual measurements or from theory . in practice",
    ", the laboratory measurements do not cover a very large range in @xmath50 , but this is usually all that is available @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the van der waals theory of broadening by foreign gases , commonly used in stellar atmospheres calculations , predicts the same temperature dependence for all lines irrespective of their angular momentum quantum numbers and the identity of the foreign broadener is usually assumed to be hydrogen atoms .",
    "the scaling of the line width linearly with pressure ignores the problem of what happens to the line width at very high pressures , as a hard sphere cutoff to the pressure scaling should exist .",
    "this is related to the value of the second and higher virial coefficients in the equation of state for the gas . since reliable experimental data on collision cross sections as derived from viscosity and diffusion data",
    "are only available for a few combinations of species and broadener , it is difficult to validate the theory under the physical conditions that apply to the astronomical case for more than a few molecule - broadener combinations . in particular , in the astronomical case the highest pressures are associated with the highest temperatures which is just the region where the parameters that determine the equation of state are the most uncertain .",
    "collision induced absorption produces a broad continuum that sculpts the foundation of ultracool dwarf spectra .",
    "our source for the subroutines to calculate the collision induced absorption comes from the recent work of a. borysow and her collaborators .",
    "we have used the latest available versions of all programs to compute the cia absorption due to @xmath54 @xmath55 and @xmath56 collisions .",
    "the fortran programs and opacity tables available on borysow s web page were used to construct tables that represent the absorption by a mixture of `` normal '' ( 3:1 ) @xmath10 .",
    "this can be contrasted with an `` equilibrium '' mixture where the ratio of the ortho and para forms of @xmath10 is 1:1 . at the high temperatures of these objects",
    "a normal distribution would be expected .",
    "this topic is discussed more thoroughly in massie and hunten ( 1982 ) and carlson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) . in any case ,",
    "the difference in the results between the two cases is only significant at the lowest temperatures and at the low frequency end of the spectrum .",
    "this would lead to small changes in the results of a few percent in these cases , well within the other sources of uncertainty in this problem .",
    "the importance of alkali atoms to atmospheric opacity in cool substellar objects was first recognized from the influence of these atoms of the far red spectra of t dwarfs @xcite .",
    "these pressure broadened lines , particularly of na and k , are major opacity sources over certain spectral ranges , temperatures , and densities , particularly above the na and k condensation temperatures ( about 600 k , lodders ( 1999a ) ) .",
    "although the exact form of the line shapes of the alkali atoms due to pressure broadening by @xmath57 is still not completely understood , it is important to include it .",
    "we use a computer code @xcite kindly provided to us by a. burrows to generate line profiles for atomic lines of neutral alkali atoms using a line width parameter setting of 1.0 ( as defined by those authors ) .",
    "burrows and volobuyev ( 2003 ) and allard et al . ( 2003 ) have further modeled the pressure broadened alkali lines .",
    "future improvements in understanding of the alkali line widths will certainly impact spectral modeling of ultracool dwarfs and may impact the mean opacities .",
    "the importance of the alkali elements to the mean opacities is discussed in section 4 .",
    "several other opacity sources are included in our calculation . bound - free absorption by h and @xmath58 and free - free absorption by h , @xmath10 , @xmath59 and @xmath58 ( see lenzuni et al .",
    "1991 ) were added using algorithms provided by tristan guillot @xcite .",
    "rayleigh scattering from @xmath36 and thompson scattering are also included in the rosseland mean following lenzuni et al .",
    "opacity from electrons and h atoms does not provide a large contribution to the overall opacity below @xmath60 but becomes important at higher temperatures relevant to m dwarf atmospheres .",
    "the opacity from the more abundant atomic species are not important in our case because our high temperature cases also involve high pressure .",
    "since we are concerned with high gravity objects the fractional abundances of atoms like fe , mg , si , and al never exceed @xmath61 and are usually much lower .",
    "furthermore the most important lines for these atoms are in the uv where there is little flux over our temperature regime .",
    "the thermochemical equilibrium abundances used in the opacity models were computed with the condor code described and applied to brown dwarf studies in several papers ( e.g. , fegley & lodders 1994 , 1996 , lodders 1999a , 2002 , lodders & fegley 2002 ) .",
    "brief overviews about the gas and cloud chemistry in substellar atmosphere can be found in lodders ( 2004 ) and lodders & fegley ( 2006 ) .",
    "here we summarize this work and highlight important issues for the problem at hand .",
    "the condor code simultaneously computes the chemical equilibrium compositions for more than 2200 gases ( including ions ) and more than 1700 solids and liquids of all naturally occurring elements by considering dual constraints of mass balance and chemical equilibrium .",
    "the major thermodynamic data sources are given in fegley & lodders ( 1994 ) , and data are frequently updated ( see e.g. , lodders 1999b , 2004 ) .",
    "note that some frequently used compilations of thermodynamic properties and/or polynomial fits contain errors that also affect compounds important for brown dwarf chemistry ( see appendix 1 in lodders 2002 ) .",
    "therefore chemical equilibrium species and abundances computed by other groups could be different than our results if erroneous thermodynamic data were used by them , which can also introduce differences in calculated opacities .",
    "the condor code uses elemental abundances , total pressure and temperature as inputs .",
    "we use the solar system abundances in lodders ( 2003 ) , uniformly enhanced or depleted to model metallicity effects where appropriate .",
    "equilibrium compositions considering cloud condensate formation for solar elemental abundances were computed for 324 pressure - temperature sample points in a grid ranging from 50 to 4000 k and @xmath62 to + 8.5 which spans characteristic conditions in the atmospheres of low mass objects .",
    "similar calculations were done for other metallicities ; here we only include results for metallicities of 2 and 1/2 times solar ( @xmath63 = \\pm 0.3 $ ] ) .    despite the plethora of gas species present in the thermochemical calculations , only a few compounds are abundant or major opacity sources , and the subset of the gases selected here for constructing the opacity tables",
    "are discussed in section 2 . compared to previous solar elemental abundance compilations ,",
    "the more recent data include significant downward revisions in the c , n , and o abundances around 20% to 40% , which have consequences for the abundances of important opacity sources such as methane , co , water , and ammonia in substellar atmospheres .",
    "the new lower c , n , and o abundances resemble a decrease in cno metallicity , and a detailed discussion of how metallicity affects the @xmath64 and @xmath65 equilibria is given in lodders & fegley ( 2002 ) .",
    "for example , one important consequence of the lower c , n , and o abundances is that the methane to co as well as the @xmath66 to @xmath67 conversions are shifted towards higher temperatures ( at constant total pressure or gravity ) , and are shifted towards lower total pressure ( at constant temperature )",
    ".    the thermochemical calculations also include results for deuterium .",
    "however , in the opacity modeling for brown dwarfs , the deuterium abundance was set to zero because it is assumed that all d is destroyed in objects more massive than 13 jupiter masses .",
    "thus , the opacities due from hdo and @xmath68 are not included .",
    "however , in lower mass objects , the hdo and @xmath68 opacities must be included and these were calculated using @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "however , the additional opacity from hdo and @xmath68 generally has only a very marginal effect on the overall results .",
    "the condor code has two principle pathways to treat condensate formation , depending on the desired application . under ideal equilibrium conditions in protoplanetary disks or stellar winds ,",
    "gas - solid equilibria are maintained within a cooling gas and therefore high temperature condensates that formed first from a cooling gas ( primary condensates ) still can react with the gas to form secondary condensates at lower temperatures .",
    "a well - known gas - solid reaction is the reaction of primary iron metal with @xmath41 gas to secondary troilite ( fes ) at low temperatures ( see below ) .",
    "however , such reactions may not apply to substellar atmospheres where cloud layer formation prevents the formation of secondary condensates ( see lodders & fegley 2002 ) .",
    "if a primary condensate settles from the gas into a cloud layer ( sometimes called rainout ) , the primary condensate becomes depleted in the atmosphere above its cloud and can not participate in reactions that are thermochemically favorable at the cooler temperatures above the cloud .",
    "for example , if iron metal condenses and settles into a cloud , the reaction of iron metal with @xmath41 to secondary troilite can not happen .",
    "this has important consequences for the gas chemistry because troilite formation would remove all @xmath41 ( essentially all the atmospheric sulfur inventory ) at the low temperatures where troilite would be stable . however , if the secondary troilite does not form , @xmath41 remains in the atmosphere until @xmath70 condenses , which only happens at @xmath71 .",

    "entry probe mass spectrometer detection of @xmath41 at about three times the solar @xmath72 ratio in jupiter s atmosphere below the @xmath70 cloud level ( niemann et al .",
    "1998 ) shows that the cloud layer condensation approach works well in giant planet atmospheres such as in jupiter ( see also lodders & fegley 2002 , visscher et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the computations with cloud settling thus require the knowledge of which condensates are primary ( formed directly from the gas ) and which ones are secondary ( formed by gas - solid reactions ) .",
    "this is easily gauged from the equilibrium calculations by checking the distribution of an element between condensates and gas .",
    "for example , under typical total pressure conditions ( e.g. , @xmath73 ) in substellar atmospheres , iron starts to condense as metal at temperatures above 1600 k , and the metal settles into a cloud layer with a base at the temperature level where metal condensation starts . at the cloud base ,",
    "iron metal is in evaporation - condensation equilibrium with the hotter atmosphere below . above the cloud base ,",
    "the iron gas abundance is determined by the iron vapor pressure of the metal cloud .",
    "the iron vapor pressure drops exponentially with the decreasing temperatures above the cloud , and mass balance dictates that more iron is in the condensates , and less iron gas remains in the atmospheric gas .",
    "typically it takes about a @xmath74 drop from the condensation temperature ( i.e. , the temperature where the condensate appears first from a cooling gas ) to the temperature where @xmath75 of an element is removed by its condensate .",
    "this is the normal vapor - pressure driven condensation process .",
    "the only special consideration here is that the condensate settles so that the amount of condensate becomes depleted at atmospheric levels above the condensate cloud that forms from the settled condensate particles .",
    "however , this does not affect the fact that the gas abundances remain established by the vapor pressure over the condensing solid or liquid because the vapor pressure over a substance is independent of the absolute amount of the substance present .",
    "troilite formation would only occur at temperatures below about 700 k , which is significantly lower than the temperatures at which iron vapor pressures are so low that essentially all iron is condensed .",
    "the gas - sold reaction for troilite formation requires the presence of iron metal , but at the temperature level where fes becomes stable , the iron metal condensate has settled out at greater depth in low mass object atmospheres , and thus , the secondary troilite can not form .    note that the thermochemical equilibrium calculations of the gas abundances do not require information about the cloud particle sizes , their settling efficiencies , or the vertical extent of the cloud layer ; nor can these calculations provide this information without further model assumptions .",
    "these parameters are not needed if we are only interested in gas opacities , however , these parameters are needed if condensate opacities are to be considered , which requires inclusion of a detailed cloud model ( see e.g. , ackerman and marley 2001 , marley et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "other observations also demonstrate that other refractory elements are depleted by condensate cloud formation at high temperatures deep in the atmospheres of low - mass objects .",
    "for example , the gradual disappearance of tio and vo bands in the optical spectra of l dwarfs requires condensation of ca - titanates into which vo dissolves ( fegley & lodders 1994 , 1996 , lodders 1999a , 2002 ) .",
    "the absence of silane ( @xmath76 ) indicates deeply seated silicate clouds and the presence of volatile germane ( @xmath77 ) in the atmospheres of jupiter and saturn shows that germanium did not condense into iron metal at low temperatures ( as it did in the solar nebula , see lodders 2003 ) because the metal settled ( fegley & lodders 1994 ) .",
    "the presence of monatomic k gas in the atmospheres of t dwarfs requires that the refractory feldspar anorthite has settled into a deep cloud because otherwise , the more volatile k could dissolve in it at lower temperatures , ( e.g. , lodders 1999a , burrows et al . 2000 , geballe et al .",
    "2001 , marley et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in summary , the major difference for _ gas _ chemistry between the  nebula \" and  cloudy \" cases is that the gas abundances of elements forming condensates by gas - solid reactions will be lower in the ",
    "nebula \" models than in the  cloudy \" models at the temperatures and total pressures where such secondary condensation is expected . in the cloudy models , the secondary condensates can not form because the solid required for the gas - solid reaction is not present ; e.g. , anorthite is required for na and k condensation in solid - solution .",
    "therefore , the _ gas opacities _ will be different for the nebula and cloudy models . as a practical matter ,",
    "the biggest impact on the opacities arises from the timing of removal of gaseous alkali species . in the `` cloudy '' chemisty , na and k",
    "persist to lower temperatures than would otherwise be the case .",
    "the spectra of t dwarfs confirms that in fact the `` cloudy '' chemistry is the correct choice for atmospheres .",
    "since we neglect grain opacity , the differences in the timing and arrival of the condensates themselves does not impact our opacity calculation .",
    "given the opacities described in section 2 and the elemental and molecular abundances described in section 3 , we computed rosseland and planck mean opacities for three metallicities ( @xmath63= -0.3 , 0.0 , + 0.3 $ ] ) .",
    "the integration over frequency was carried out using a grid of equally spaced wavenumber points .",
    "the frequency spacing was based on the temperature and pressure of each layer , such that the spectral resolution was always fine ( 1/4 of a line width or @xmath78 , whichever is less ) compared to a typical line profile under those conditions .",
    "spacings are as small as @xmath79 in some instances .",
    "such a fine grid is usually not required for mean opacity calculations , but we also use the same grid for high resolution spectral modeling .",
    "our grid of 324 @xmath80 pairs ranges from 75 to @xmath81 and @xmath2 to @xmath82 ( or @xmath4 to 300 bar ) .",
    "we do not compute opacities at high pressure and low temperature or high temperature and low pressure , as such points are not reached by brown dwarf and giant planet atmosphere models .",
    "the table spacing is not uniform in order to better sample important processes , including water condensation .",
    "figure 2 illustrates the pressure - temperature domain over which we computed opacities as well as the magnitude of the rosseland mean opacities for a solar composition gas .",
    "this figure also shows temperature - pressure profiles computed for jupiter and a variety of other substellar objects .",
    "tables i , ii , and iii provide rosseland and planck mean opacities as a function of pressure and temperature for the three metallicities we consider on this grid .",
    "the complete tables may be found in the on line supplement to this paper . in the tables",
    "opacities have been converted to units of @xmath83 by calculating the mean molecular weight ( for gaseous species only ) at each temperature - pressure level , for each chemical composition .",
    "because of our choice of a uniform pressure - temperature @xmath84 grid , our data are not on a uniform mass density ( @xmath85 ) grid . for easier comparison with earlier work , we also interpolated to a set of constant densities for graphical purposes .",
    "figures 3 illustrates the rosseland mean opacities along profiles of constant density .",
    "we note that such an interpolation on occasions crosses chemical equilibria and condensation boundaries , which produces some kinks in the interpolated data shown on the figure .",
    "perhaps the greatest difference from previous tabulations of mean opacities arises from the inclusion of the pressure - broadened lines of the alkali elements , particularly sodium and potassium .",
    "these molecules , with their large absorption cross sections in the far red and very near infrared ( burrows et al .",
    "2000 ) fill what would otherwise be a region of fairly low opacity .",
    "figure 4 compares the summed opacity as a function of wavenumber at 1400 k and @xmath22 in our baseline case with a calculation that neglects the alkali opacity .",
    "the substantial role of the alkali opacity to the total summed opacity is unmistakable above about @xmath86 .",
    "the influence of the alkali opacity on the total gaseous mean opacity is illustrated in figure 5 which compares the rosseland mean opacity with and without the contribution of alkali metals at several densities .",
    "it is clear that at the higher densities the alkali opacity substantially fills in the opacity minimum from about 1000 to 1500 k. differences at lower densities are slight since the pressure - broadened lines play a much smaller role .",
    "guillot et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) predicted that low opacity around 1,000 to 2,000 k in jupiter s deep atmosphere would lead to the formation of a radiative region within what was then expected to be the fully convective deep interior of jupiter . in figure 2",
    "it can be seen by extrapolation that jupiter s deep adiabat indeed passes through a trough in opacity in this temperature range .",
    "we now understand that the opacity in this local minimum region ",
    "owing to the contribution of pressure - broadened alkali opacity  is much larger than was considered by guillot et al .",
    "( 1994a , b ) using the opacities available at that time . in a reevaluation of their earlier work ,",
    "guillot et al .",
    "( 2004 ) indeed found that the alkali opacity is sufficient to prevent substantial energy transport by radiation in jupiter s interior .",
    "the rosseland opacities we report here are consistent with those used in the latest work by guillot and collaborators .",
    "thus , despite the intrinsic uncertainty in the alkali line widths at high pressure , a thin radiative shell within the interior of jupiter need not be considered in the construction of interior models .",
    "this removes one source of uncertainty in the construction of evolution and interior models of jupiter .",
    "as noted in  2.4 , the pressure broadened line shape for the alkali metals remains uncertain , particularly at high pressure . in the future",
    ", it may be possible to obtain experimental data on the line absorption coefficients of pressure broadened alkali lines so that the effects of their shapes on the total opacity can be quantified to replace the semi empirical profiles @xcite .",
    "the opacities and chemical equilibrium calculations described here are examples of the current state of the art for understanding giant planet and brown dwarf atmospheres .",
    "nevertheless , a number of uncertainties remain , particularly in the treatment of the opacities at high temperatures . because it is a dominant source of opacity , of course water is of special concern , but comparisons between the most recent theoretical line lists suggest that , at least the the temperatures considered here , the line list is in reasonably good shape",
    ". further work on calculating an updated version of the the water spectrum is currently underway .",
    "missing opacity at high temperatures is certainly a problem in even greater measure for most of the other molecular opacities , particularly methane , but these other molecules are generally less important than water to the mean opacity .",
    "in fact , only water , co , tio , and to a lesser extent vo have a significant contribution from hot bands while @xmath87 and , to a lesser extent , @xmath41 contain lines originating from higher rotational quantum values which have been predicted from a mixture of theory and available experimental data .    for comparisons with spectra of ultracool dwarfs",
    ", however , the lack of adequate high temperature opacities for methane and ammonia is an important limitation ( e.g. , leggett et al .",
    "improving this situation will require in the case of methane a substantial theoretical and computational effort .",
    "newer data are under development for water by david schwenke and for co by one of us ( r.f . ) that would allow a recomputation of the line lists . in the case of water",
    "this could lead to a better representation of the opacity at the highest temperatures , while any changes in the co database will probably be less substantial .",
    "because the calculations presented here do not include condensates as an opacity source a direct comparison with earlier work that includes grains is difficult . in our brown dwarf and extrasolar planet modeling calculations cloud opacity is computed from the local description of the atmospheric structure , rather than relying on a pre - computed table . because these additional sources of opacity may appear at different pressures and temperatures in a series of models depending on the assumptions built into the calculation , it is not possible to give a general set of results that include solid material .",
    "any such tables must be regarded with some caution as condensate size and abundance depends on other parameters , including the convective velocity , and no single prescription as a function of only density and temperature can be given .",
    "in fact the grain opacity plays an important role in the gaseous accretion of giant planets by the core accretion mechanism @xcite .",
    "we show in figure 6 a comparison with recent grain free calculations @xcite .",
    "this work uses updated atomic abundances to compute mean opacities at relatively low densities relevant to circumstellar disks .",
    "as such the region of overlap in density and temperature is relatively small . in the overlapping region , however , the correspondence is reasonably good . since this is a low density region , the effect of the alkali opacity is negligible and is not a factor .",
    "the tables presented here and in the on line supplement to this paper provide rosseland and planck mean opacities for three elemental compositions relevant to the study of ultracool dwarfs and extrasolar giant planets .",
    "we have also described the databases for line transitions and our approach to computing the line broadening as well as the chemical equilibrium calculation .",
    "future improvements in the molecular opacities  particularly at high temperature  will certainly improve the quality of model spectra for the comparison with astronomical data . barring the addition of substantial new opacity sources or further updates to the solar abundance of the elements",
    ", we do not expect to see significant changes to the rosseland and planck mean opacities reported here .",
