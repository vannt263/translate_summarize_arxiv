    "this article discusses two approaches to constructing effective field theories through the renormalization of a quantum field theory .",
    "the first approach , due to costello @xcite , constructs an effective field theory starting from any choice of a local action functional .",
    "it relies on a particular construction of local counterterms which are used to render certain functional integrals defining the effective field theory finite .",
    "the algorithm that costello uses to construct these counterterms is simple and uses no graphical combinatorics .",
    "in fact , this algorithm may be formulated without the need to even mention the notion of a feynman amplitude .",
    "one proceeds carefully through the terms in the perturbation series in a specific order , renormalizing each term along the way .",
    "an interesting development arising from this perspective on effective field theory lies in the quantization of gauge theories in the batalin - vilkovisky formalism , where costello arrives at the definition of a new and interesting smooth invariant of certain low - dimensional manifolds @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the second approach we discuss relies on the graphical combinatorics of the well - known algorithm due to bogoliubov - parasiuk @xcite , hepp @xcite and zimmermann @xcite ( bphz ) to replace the divergent feynman amplitudes in the functional integrals defining the effective field theory with finite values .",
    "this algorithm has been a central part of quantum field theory for many decades @xcite .",
    "more recently , connes and kreimer @xcite , @xcite have encoded this algorithm through a hopf algebra in which the bphz algorithm is described in terms of the birkhoff factorization of characters of this hopf algebra .",
    "lately , questions have been raised in the literature @xcite , @xcite and elsewhere @xcite concerning what , if any , connection may exist between the approach of costello @xcite and the approach of connes - kreimer @xcite which relies on the bphz construction of counterterms for a renormalizable quantum field theory .    in this paper",
    "we provide a positive answer to this question .",
    "namely , we show that these two constructions of an effective field theory that come from the work @xcite of costello and from the bphz algorithm coincide . one conclusion of this is that in our situation the bphz construction of counterterms has a particularly simple nondiagrammatic formulation , although we should mention that in this case the information regarding the divergence of each graph is lost , as the singular components of a number of graphs are combined into a single counterterm .    throughout the paper",
    "we choose our space of fields @xmath0 to be the space of smooth functions on a riemannian manifold , that is to say we only consider scalar field theories , although it will quickly be evident from the exposition that our results hold for a much broader class of choices for @xmath0 , such as the space of global sections of a vector bundle of the form described in section 2.13 of @xcite . however , our choice of @xmath0 has the advantage that it s definition is simple , transparent and nontechnical , but yet it retains the appropriate amount of structure required to exhibit the coincidence of the two constructions described above .",
    "we mention , of course , that one obvious problem we face in choosing the appropriate level of generality in which to frame our results is that no mathematical consensus currently exists as to what a quantum field theory actually is .",
    "the layout of the paper is as follows .",
    "section [ sec_effthy ] recalls the basic picture of effective field theory that is outlined by costello in @xcite .",
    "section [ sec_calgo ] describes costello s construction of the local counterterms he uses for renormalizing a quantum field theory and recalls how this gives rise to an effective field theory .",
    "section [ sec_bphz ] gives a careful formulation of the bphz algorithm as it applies to our particular situation and proves some basic properties of the counterterms produced . in section [ sec_main ]",
    "we prove the main theorem of the paper which states that the effective field theory described by costello and the effective field theory produced by the bphz algorithm are the same .",
    "in this paper we will consider topological vector spaces over the real numbers .",
    "we will denote the completed projective tensor product of two locally convex topological vector spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 by @xmath3 ; the symbol @xmath4 will be reserved for the standard tensor product . since all of the topological vector spaces that we will apply @xmath5 to will be nuclear spaces , the projective and injective tensor products coincide .",
    "this of course means that we work in a nice symmetric monoidal category .",

    ", we will always equip the dual space with the strong topology .",
    "we will denote the space of _ continuous _ linear maps between two topological vector spaces @xmath1 and @xmath2 by @xmath7 .",

    "in this section we recall some basic background material on effective field theory from @xcite , which follows the work of wilson @xcite .",
    "we start by fixing some of the geometric and analytic framework that we will work in .",
    "let @xmath11 be a compact riemannian manifold .",
    "we fix our space of fields to be @xmath22 ; that is to say that we shall only consider ( massive ) scalar field theories .",
    "we denote the laplacian on @xmath12 by @xmath23 , whose definition is fixed by the convention that its eigenvalues are nonnegative .",
    "the heat kernel @xmath24 is defined uniquely by the equation @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the mass .    from the heat kernel",

    "the reader may wonder why we give such a formal definition of what is after all a very standard part of quantum field theory .",
    "the reason is that we wish to use this section to introduce the requisite algebraic and combinatorial background from @xcite , @xcite and @xcite that we make use of in the rest of the paper when we come to dealing with the bphz algorithm and proving the main theorem .",

    "the reason for this preference , as costello carefully explains in @xcite , is that it is much easier to incorporate locality in this picture .",

    "<S> in this paper we discuss two constructions of an effective field theory starting from a local interaction functional . </S>",
    "<S> one relies on the well - established graphical combinatorics of the bphz algorithm to renormalize divergent feynman amplitudes . </S>",
    "<S> the other , more recent and due to costello , relies on an inductive construction of local counterterms that uses no graphical combinatorics whatsoever . </S>",
    "<S> we show that these two constructions produce the same effective field theory . </S>"
