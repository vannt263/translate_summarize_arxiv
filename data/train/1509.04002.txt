    "due to frequency reuse , a wireless communication system is affected by not only the thermal noise but also interference from other transmitters in the same frequency band .",
    "the thermal noise can be modeled as additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) . on the other hand , the network interference characteristic is often elusive as it depends on many aspects , for example the spatial structure of the overall network or the propagation characteristics .",
    "for ease of analysis , interference can be approximated by awgn with some given power @xcite .",
    "however , such simple model does not capture many physical parameters affecting the interference .",
    "more realistic models , using hexagonal or square lattice , are often difficult to analyze and thus mostly rely on simulations for investigation . system modeling based on stochastic geometry can account for all practical parameters while yielding explicit performance expressions , hence is promising .",
    "stochastic geometry has been applied to investigate communication networks as early as 1970s @xcite .",
    "it has been successfully integrated and adapted to cellular , ultra - wideband , cognitive radio , relay , and especially ad hoc networks @xcite .",
    "since wireless systems is mostly interference - limited , a majority of the works have focused on characterizing the interference and the signal - to - interference ratio ( sir ) at each receiver / user equipment ( ue ) .",
    "please refer to @xcite for detailed summaries . under most networks ,",
    "the interference and/or sir distribution were represented only through laplace transforms , which are often complicated .",
    "useful bounds of the sir distribution for several system models have been proposed in @xcite and @xcite . in the seminal work @xcite",
    ", the fading ad hoc network has been investigated under the assumption that the desired signal power at a typical receiver / ue is exponentially distributed .",
    "based on the laplace transform and probability generating functionals of poisson point processes ( ppps ) , andrews _ et .",
    "al . _ have shown that the interference and sir distribution of a wide range of networks can be greatly simplified .",
    "such approach has enabled simpler derivations of the outage probability and achievable rate , and thus motivated more investigations @xcite .",
    "stochastic geometry is particularly useful in modeling and studying heterogeneous networks , which consists of many coexisting communication systems and in which all participating transmitters and receivers are randomly located @xcite .",
    "coordination and cooperation between cells have also been considered , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "a shortcoming of many existing works is that they assume a very large ue density compared to the transmitter / bs density , effectively considering severely interfering networks only . to address this shortcoming ,",
    "several recent studies have introduced a general model which includes the ue density as a varying parameter for performance investigation @xcite .    in this paper , we obtain new results for the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) and sir cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) at a typical ue under non - fading and rayleigh fading ad hoc networks , where the transmitting nodes are distributed according to ppps . particularly for non - fading ad hoc network , the laplace transform of the inverted sinr are given , with which the distribution can be numerically calculated .",
    "we also derive upper- and lower bounds for the sir cdf , which possess closed - form expressions and are thus more useful for subsequent analyses .",
    "for rayleigh fading ad hoc network , we obtain closed - form bounds for the sir cdf .",
    "based on these results , the average shannon and outage rate bounds are acquired under both cases .",
    "similar results are obtained for partial fading ad - hoc systems . since",
    "many communication networks can be modeled or reduced to these two ad hoc systems , our results are potentially useful for a wide range of problems . for example , we will show that our results can be applied to study and compare the performance of two important fifth - generation ( 5 g ) technologies , i.e. , massive multiple - input multiple - output ( m - mimo ) and small - cell densification .",
    "more information can be found in our subsequent paper @xcite .",
