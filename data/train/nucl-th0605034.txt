    "in this presentation we discuss specific features of the continuum shell model ( cosmo ) , the approach based on the projection formalism @xcite , formulated in the classical book @xcite and developed into a practical instrument in refs .",
    "the whole problem of many - body physics on the verge of stability has been extensively explored in the past , especially in relation to weakly bound nuclei .",

    "the goal of this paper is to highlight complimentary views on the nuclear many - body physics from the  inside \" ( structure ) and  outside \" ( reactions ) perspectives .",
    "the structure view is based on the traditional shell model where the effective hamiltonian to be diagonalized plays the central role .",
    "new contributions to the effective hamiltonian coming from the presence of continuum bring in non - hermiticity and energy dependence . overcoming these complications , it is possible to calculate in the same framework the cross sections of reactions , with their energy dependence and possible resonance behavior .",
    "the complementary picture that appears from the side of nuclear reactions is important for identifying resonances and comparison with experiment .",
    "while the shell model approach to the many - body structure in discrete spectrum is firmly established the many - body reaction physics is usually left for more phenomenological tools of the reaction practitioners .",
    "the purpose of secs .",
    "[ unit ] and [ cheb ] in this work is to accentuate on novel methods involved in calculation of green s functions and associated time evolution operators that stay behind cosmo .",
    "the example of a realistic application presented in the last section is a central point of the paper .",
    "the chain of helium isotopes is shown where a single picture combines different methods and different points of view on the same problem .",
    "the bound states of the conventional shell model below threshold are followed at higher energies by the solutions of the cosmo effective hamiltonian revealing resonances that coincide with the complex poles of the scattering matrix .",
    "the same resonances appear in the neutron scattering cross section plotted in the same figure .",
    "the discrepancies between the cross section peaks and resonance states emphasize subtle features of many - body dynamics in a marginally stable system .",
    "using the projection formalism one can eliminate the part of the hilbert space related to particle(s ) in continuum .",
    "this results in the effective hamiltonian @xmath0 that acts only in the `` intrinsic '' shell model space , @xmath1 here the full hamiltonian @xmath2 is restricted to intrinsic space , and is supplemented with the hermitian term @xmath3 that describes virtual particle excitations into excluded space and the imaginary term @xmath4 representing irreversible decays to the continuum . the new parts of the hamiltonian ( [ 1 ] ) are found in terms of the matrix elements of the full original hamiltonian that link the internal states @xmath5 with the energy - labeled external states",

    "the effective hamiltonian is non - hermitian which reflects the possible leak of probability from the internal system .",
    "the hamiltonian has explicit energy dependence , making the internal dynamics highly non - linear .",
    "the additional terms in the hamiltonian that appear as a result of projection can be complicated .",
    "even with exclusively two - body forces in the full space , the many - body interactions appear in the projected effective hamiltonian .    by construction , the eigenvalue problem @xmath9 determines the internal part of the solution which is subject to the regular boundary condition inside matched to purely outgoing waves in the continuum . for energies @xmath10 below all thresholds ,",

    "( [ 5 ] ) has no real energy solutions , and the stationary state boundary condition can not be satisfied .",
    "the similarity of this problem to that for the bound states makes it appealing to depart from the real axis and to find discrete non - hermitian eigenvalues .",
    "the complex energy roots @xmath13 of ( [ 5 ] ) correspond to poles of the scattering matrix , see discussion below , and represent the many - body resonant siegert states @xcite",
    ".    the transition into a complex energy plane may be rather impractical , it causes computational complications related to numerous branch cuts and unphysical roots , the relation to observables becomes complicated and rather remote . as an alternative , the breit - wigner approach @xcite is commonly used . here",

    "$ ] in the limit of a small imaginary part ( narrow resonances ) various definitions are equivalent . in the application of the cosmo discussed below we use the breit - wigner approach . however , the general difficulty in parameterizing resonances in terms of centroid energies and widths should be noted . as demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ he ] , the problem becomes especially acute for broad resonances , high density of states , or in near - threshold situations .",
    "a look at the problem from the observable cross sections is imperative .",

    "the reaction theory is fully consistent with resonant description in sec .",
    "[ structure ] . however , complexity of the many - body propagator in eq .",
    "( [ 7 ] ) with numerous poles , interfering paths and energy dependence can make the observable cross section which is a projection of poles onto a real energy axis quite different from a collection of individual resonance peaks .    the solution of eq .",
    "( [ 5 ] ) with the large scale many - body hamiltonian is a complicated task as extensively discussed in refs .",
    "the calculation of the transition matrix ( [ 7 ] ) and of the cross section is yet another technical problem .",
    "the direct approach involving matrix inversion at all energies is extremely difficult and time consuming given large dimensions involved .",
    "the sharp resonances typically present in the spectrum make the process numerically unstable and require dense energy sampling to achieve a reasonable cross section curve .",
    "absence of absolute numerical precision leads to instability near stable states embedded in the continuum where decays are prohibited by symmetry considerations .",
    "this problem is particularly troublesome within the @xmath19-scheme shell model approach . to overcome these difficulties ,",
    "an alternative method has been developed which is discussed below .",
    "the transition matrix ( [ 7 ] ) with the dimensionality equal to the number of open channels can be written as @xmath21 , where the full effective green s function @xmath22 includes the loss of probability into all decay channels .",

    "the rescaling , although not required , is useful for providing numerical stability .",
    "given a trivial nature of the rescaling procedure and its reversal , below we do not introduce special notations for the rescaled hamiltonian .",

    "$ ] in comparison to the taylor expansion or other methods evaluating the green s function , the chebyshev polynomials provide a complete set of orthogonal functions covering uniformly the interval [ -1,1 ] .",
    "although individual states can be resolved , the procedure is most effective when a significant energy region is involved , namely for overlapping resonances .",
    "the asymptotic of the bessel functions assures convergence of the series .",
    "the `` angle addition '' equations that follow from the definition of polynomials , @xmath44 are useful for the successive evaluation of series of vectors @xmath45 using the following iterative procedure : @xmath46    in the cosmo approach the calculations of reactions are performed using the fast fourier transformation of eq .",

    "the chebyshev polynomials are divergent in the complex plane ; therefore only the hermitian part @xmath32 corresponding to the @xmath20 matrix can be used in the evolution operator ( [ 11 ] ) . using a conservative estimate",
    "it can be shown that @xmath47 iterations lead to the energy resolution @xmath48 .",
