    "the investigations of josephson effect manifestations in different systems are continuing because of it s importance both for basic science and industry .",
    "a point contact between two massive superconductors ( s - c - s junction ) is one of the possible josephson weak links .",
    "a microscopic theory of the stationary josephson effect in ballistic point contacts between conventional superconductors was developed in @xcite .",
    "later , this theory was generalized for a pinhole model in @xmath1 @xcite , for point contacts between  @xmath2-wave  @xcite , and triplet superconductors @xcite .",
    "the josephson effect is the phase sensitive instrument for the analysis of an order parameter in novel ( unconventional ) superconductors , where current - phase dependencies @xmath3 may differ essentially from those in conventional superconductors @xcite . in some cases the model with total transparency of the point contact does not quite adequately correspond to the experiment , and the electron reflection should be taken into account .",
    "the influence of electron reflection on the josephson current in ballistic point contacts was first considered by zaitsev @xcite .",
    "he had shown that reflection from the contact not only changes the critical value of current , but also the current - phase dependence @xmath4 at low temperature which has been predicted in @xcite .",
    "the current - phase dependence for small values of transparency , @xmath5 , is transformed to the @xmath6 , similar to the planar tunnel junction .",
    "the effect of transparency for point contact between unconventional ( d - wave ) superconductors is studied in the papers @xcite .",
    "the non - locality of josephson current in point contacts was investigated in @xcite .",
    "the authors of @xcite concentrated on the influence of magnetic field on the zero voltage supercurrent through the junction .",
    "they found an periodic behavior in terms of magnetic flux and demonstrated that this anomalous behavior is a result of a non - locality supercurrent in the junction .",
    "this observation was explained theoretically in @xcite .",
    "recently an influence of transport supercurrent , which flows in the contacted banks and is parallel to the interface , to the josephson effect in point contacts has been analyzed theoretically@xcite .",
    "it was found that a non - local mixing of two superconducting currents results in the appearance of two vortex - like current states in vicinity of the contact , when the external phase difference is @xmath7 .",
    "the josephson current through superconducting weak link is a result of quantum interference between order parameters with phase difference @xmath8 .",
    "obviously , the finite reflection @xmath9 of electrons from the josephson junction suppresses this interference and it must influence the vortex - like current states , which are predicted in @xcite . in this paper",
    "we study the effect of finite transparency on the current - phase dependence and distribution of the superconducting current near the ballistic point contact in the presence of homogeneous current states far from the contact .",
    "we show that at low temperatures @xmath10 the electron reflection destroys the mentioned vortex - like current states even for a very small value of reflection coefficient @xmath11 on the other hand we have found that , as the temperature increases the vortices are restored and they exist for transparency as low as @xmath12 in the limit of @xmath13 .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows . in sec.@xmath14",
    "we describe the model of the point contact , quasiclassical equations for green s functions and boundary conditions .",
    "the analytical formulas for the green functions are derived for a ballistic point contact with arbitrary transparency . in sec.@xmath15",

    "we end in sec.@xmath17 with some conclusions .",
    "we consider the josephson weak link as a microbridge between thin superconducting films of thickness @xmath2 . the length @xmath18 and width @xmath19 of the microbridge , are assumed to be less than the coherence length @xmath20 . on the other hand",
    ", we assume that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are much larger than the fermi wavelength @xmath21 and use the quasiclassical approach . there is a potential barrier in the contact , resulting in a finite probability for the electron that is to be reflected back . in the banks of superconductors",

    "the superconducting current in the quasiclassical approximation @xmath30 is defined by the energy integrated green s function @xmath31 which in the ballistic case satisfies the eilenberger equation of the form @xcite @xmath32 = 0 , \\label{eilenberger eq}\\ ] ] with normalization condition , @xmath33 . here",

    "similar to the case @xmath155 in @xcite , at high values of transparency , the  interference  current can dominate the transport current and tangential current can be anti - parallel to the transport current , thus the vortices appear .",

    "in the plots for tangential current versus transparency , fig . [ fig4 ] we can observe this phenomenon ( appearance of the counter - flow near the contact at high temperatures ) .",

    "josephson and transport currents have this property , but about the tangential current @xmath85 , the situation is totally different . at high values of transparency",
    "the @xmath85 has similar behavior to the two other currents , but at low and intermediate values of transparency at @xmath108 it has a non - monotonic dependence on the temperature and this is the origin of the anomalous temperature behavior of vortices . as the temperature increases , the tangential current first increases and then decreases . in fig.[fig8 ] we plotted the tangential current (  interference+ transport current ) versus the temperature for different values of transparency .",
    "we observed that for intermediate values of transparency @xmath156 , at low temperatures and @xmath108 the tangential current has anomalous dependence on the temperature .",
    "the reason for this dependence is that the `` interference '' current flows in the opposite direction to the transport current .",

    "as a consequence of that with increasing of @xmath41 the tangential current can change its sign and vortices appear .",
    "we found that for low values of transparency @xmath157 the  interference  current can not dominate the transport current and in addition the tangential current has the same direction as the transport current for any temperature @xmath158",
    "we have studied theoretically the stationary josephson effect in the ballistic point contact with transport current on the banks in the model s - c - s taking into account the reflection of electrons from the contact .",
    "the contact is subject to two external factors : the phase difference @xmath8 and the transport current tangential to the boundary of the contact . as it was shown in @xcite , in the contact with direct conductivity at @xmath108 and near the orifice the tangential current flows in the opposite direction to the transport current , and there are two anti - symmetric vortex - like structures .",
    "the transparency effect on the vortex - like currents has a central role in our paper . by decreasing the transparency @xmath159",
    "the vortex - like current is destroyed .",
    "the critical value of @xmath160 depends on the temperature @xmath41 and @xmath161 @xmath162 , so that we can never find a vortex for transparency values lower than @xmath163 . this anomalous temperature behavior of the vortices is the result of non - monotonic dependence of the interference current on the temperature .",
    "the principal possibility of the realization of the considered effect in an experiment was described in the paper @xcite : a superconducting long thin - wall cylinder ( with thickness of the wall @xmath2 less than london penetration depth ) with two cuts , such as a distance between them is smaller than coherence length @xmath164 is placed in magnetic field , which is parallel to the cylinder axis .",
    "a space between the cuts plays a role of the point contact .",
    "the phase difference @xmath8 is governed by the external magnetic flux .",
