    "the observation of the top quark in 1995  @xcite provided an isospin partner for the @xmath1 quark , thereby completing the quark sector of the standard model ( sm ) . within the context of the sm , every feature of the top quark is specified , aside from its mass . in addition , assuming three quark generations , the ckm matrix element @xmath2 is constrained to be very close to one  @xcite , meaning that the top quark decays nearly always to a @xmath3 boson and @xmath1 quark .",
    "in these proceedings , i review the current status of our knowledge of the top quark .",
    "i start by discussing the search for electroweak single top production , and what we have learned about the top quark s couplings from that search .",
    "i then describe a series of measurements made using @xmath0 events , starting with the mass of the top quark , and continuing to its production and decay properties . aside from a single exception ,",
    "these measurements are based on data collected by the d  and cdf experiments at the tevatron @xmath4 collider at fermilab .",
    "i close with a preview of the precision with which top quark properties are expected to be measured at the large hadron collider .",
    "electroweak single top production is of interest because its rate depends directly on the strength of the top quark s coupling to a gauge boson .",
    "single top quarks can be produced via both s- and t - channel diagrams , and measuring both the total rate and the individual rates for t- and s - channel production probes the presence of contributions from non - sm couplings .",
    "searches for single top production make use of leptonic ( electronic or muonic ) decays of the @xmath3 boson from the top quark , which provides the signature of a high-@xmath5 lepton , missing @xmath6 , and two or more jets ( with two of the jets being @xmath1 jets ) .      at the tevatron",
    ", the cross section for single top production is expected to be @xmath7pb .",
    "this is many orders of magnitude below the cross sections for the @xmath3+jet and multijet processes that form the main backgrounds . selecting events with the jets , leptons , and missing @xmath6 consistent with single top production yields a sample with a signal - to - background ratio of @xmath8 .",
    "extracting the single top contribution requires identification of @xmath1 jets and maximal use of the kinematic information in the event .",
    "the former is implemented using precision tracking to discriminate @xmath1 jets from promptly - decaying light - quark and gluon jets , while the latter relies on a set of multivariate classifiers .",
    "these include classical likelihoods , neural networks , matrix element calculations and boosted decision trees .",
    "to maximize sensitivity , the data is split into subsets based on the type of lepton , total number of jets , and number of @xmath1-tagged jets .    with a data sample of 0.9 fb@xmath9 ,",
    "d  combines the results from three multivariate analyses to extract a single - top cross production section of @xmath10 pb @xcite .",
    "the significance of the signal corresponds to about 3.6 standard deviations ( s.d . ) , with a significance of 2.3 s.d expected for the sm . assuming that the excess above background is from single top production , a lower limit of 0.68 at 95% c.l .",
    "is set on @xmath2 .",
    "cdf uses a 2.7 fb@xmath9 sample to perform four multivariate analyses  @xcite . the expected signal significance for these ranges from 3.8 s.d . to 5.0 s.d . , and while all four analyses find evidence for single top production , the measured cross sections ( @xmath11  @xmath12 pb ) are smaller than the sm prediction , resulting in observed significances of 2.6 to 4.2 s.d .. while the evidence strongly favors electroweak single top production , neither cdf nor d  can claim this definitively , a situation that should change as more data is analyzed .",
    "non - sm top quark couplings can alter the rate of single top production ( both in the s- and t - channels ) and also the kinematic distributions of the decay products .",
    "the lowest - dimensionality lagrangian for the @xmath13 coupling has the form :    @xmath14    in the sm , @xmath15 and all of the other form factors are zero .",
    "d  searches for non - sm effects by performing a series of measurements in which the boosted decision tree selection is optimized to discriminate from background signals arising from two possible couplings ( the sm @xmath16 coupling is always assumed to contribute , and each of the other form factors are tested sequentially )  @xcite . by fitting the decision tree output distribution in data to expectations from background and the signal model for each form factor , d  measures",
    "the contribution of each form factor , and the resulting constraints on the form factors are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topanomcouplings ] . at this stage ,",
    "the results are consistent with purely sm coupling .",
    "if there is a charged higgs boson with mass greater than that of the top quark , it would be expected to decay preferentially to @xmath18 , resulting in the same set of final - state particles as in s - channel single - top quark production .",
    "consequently , the same selection tools used in the search for the single top can also be used to search for the @xmath19 .",
    "if the @xmath19 is a narrow resonance , its contribution will appear as an enhancement in the @xmath20 mass distribution .",
    "d  has searched for such a resonance in 0.9  fb@xmath9 of data , and finds that the data is consistent with purely sm production  @xcite .",
    "this translates to 95% c.l .",
    "lower limits on the @xmath19 mass ranging from 184 gev to 181 gev as the assumed value of @xmath21 is varied from 25 to 50 .",
    "no mass limit can be set for @xmath22 , since such models violate the assumption that the @xmath19 has a narrow width .",
    "flavor - changing neutral - current ( fcnc ) couplings would tend to increase the rate of single top quark production , both at the tevatron and at the hera @xmath23 collider .",
    "an anomalous coupling of the form @xmath24 could lead to top quark production at hera , and the h1 and zeus experiments have searched for @xmath25  @xcite .",
    "h1 has updated these results , using 482 pb  @xmath9 of data to search for @xmath26 with the @xmath3 boson decaying leptonically  @xcite .",
    "a multivariate discriminant is used to distinguish top quark production from sm backgrounds .",
    "the output distribution of this discriminant is consistent with sm production , providing a limit of @xmath27 pb at 95% c.l .",
    "this corresponds to a limit on the @xmath24 magnetic coupling constant of @xmath28 , where the cutoff scale @xmath29 is taken to be the top quark mass .",
    "cdf searches for anomalous single - top production arising from the fcnc @xmath30 or @xmath31 couplings  @xcite ( an earlier measurement by d  is described in  @xcite ) .",
    "this kind of anomalous production changes both the kinematic distributions and the @xmath1 jet content in the final state with respect to the sm expectation .",
    "cdf exploits these differences by training a neural network to discriminate between anomalous single top production and background , where background includes sm single top production .",
    "no evidence of anomalous production is observed , which provides limits on the fcnc coupling constants of @xmath32 and @xmath33 at 95% c.l .",
    "most top quark properties are measured using @xmath0 pairs produced via the strong interaction . not only is the cross section of @xmath34  pb for this process higher than that for single top production at the tevatron , but @xmath0 events are also more easily distinguished from background . with two top quarks in the event ,",
    "several final - state signatures arise from the different decay channels of the two @xmath3 bosons .",
    "the rarest is when both @xmath3 bosons decay leptonically ( the `` dilepton '' mode ) , accounting for about 5% of all @xmath0 final states .",
    "the mode in which one @xmath3 decays leptonically and the other hadronically ( the `` lepton plus jets '' mode ) accounts for 30% , modes with one or more @xmath35 leptons account for 19% , and the remaining 45% of the events have both @xmath3 bosons decaying hadronically ( the `` all jets '' mode ) .",
    "the lepton plus jets mode offers the best combination of rate and purity , but it is important to study the other modes as well , since new physics may contribute with different strengths to different final states .      in the sm , we expect 85% of @xmath0 production at the tevatron to arise from @xmath37 annihilation , with the remainder from @xmath36 fusion .",
    "cdf has measured the @xmath36 production fraction @xmath38 using three different analysis techniques  @xcite .",
    "the first two of these use events in the lepton plus jets final state .",
    "one analysis compares the number of low-@xmath5 tracks in @xmath0 candidate events with those in data control samples arising from gluon - mediated ( qcd dijets ) and quark - mediated ( @xmath3 or @xmath39 boson ) processes . since gluons tend to radiate additional soft gluons more readily than quarks do , gluon - mediated events tend to have more low-@xmath5 tracks .",
    "the second analysis combines kinematic variables into a neural network to discriminate between @xmath37 and @xmath36 initial states ( angular variables that are sensitive to the difference in spin between the two initial states are especially useful ) .",
    "these measurements are combined to yield @xmath40 ( stat .",
    "+ syst . ) .",
    "cdf s third measurement uses events in the dilepton final state , in which the azimuthal angle between the leptons is sensitive to the production mechanism .",
    "this analysis yields @xmath41 .",
    "measuring the @xmath0 production cross section is important because a discrepancy between the measured and the calculated values would indicate the presence of new physics either in the production or decay of top quarks .",
    "this measurement requires the detector response to leptons and jets to be well calibrated , and backgrounds well understood . to maximize sensitivity to new physics ,",
    "both cdf and d  have measured the production cross section in all final states .",
    "a summary of these measurements is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : topxs ] , which indicates no inconsistency between the final states .",
    "combining measurements within each experiment yields @xmath42 pb for cdf  @xcite and @xmath43 pb for d  @xcite . in both cases ,",
    "the total uncertainty is similar to the uncertainty in the theoretical prediction , so that improvements in calculations will be required to provide sensitivity to any new physics resulting from this measurement .",
    "precision measurement of the top quark mass is of interest both because it is a parameter of the sm and also because it contributes to information about the mass of the higgs boson .",
    "the latter arises from sensitivity to loop corrections to the @xmath3 boson mass , which are dominated by contributions from the top quark and higgs boson .",
    "hence , if both the @xmath3 boson and top quark masses are measured precisely , the higgs boson mass can be constrained .",
    "assuming sm production and decay , the top quark mass can be estimated by comparing the measured @xmath0 production cross section with the theoretical expectation as a function of hypothesized @xmath44 .",
    "this has the advantage that the resulting mass is calculated in a well - understood renormalization scheme .",
    "d  uses its cross section measurement to obtain @xmath45 gev or @xmath46 gev @xcite , depending on the theoretical calculation .",
    "the most accurate measurements of the top quark mass apply the matrix element method to events in the lepton plus jets final state . here",
    "the matrix element technique is used not only to discriminate signal from background ( assigning the most signal - like events the largest weight in the fit ) , but also to discriminate between different top mass hypotheses .",
    "approximations in the method ( e.g , the impact of using only the leading - order @xmath37 annihilation diagram for signal , and considering only the @xmath3+jet background contribution ) are taken into account by applying the method to mc samples of known top mass , and correcting for any observed offsets .",
    "one attractive feature of the lepton plus jets final state is the presence of a hadronically - decaying @xmath3 boson .",
    "reconstructing the mass of this boson provides additional information about the jet energy calibration , thereby reducing the systematic uncertainty .",
    "d  and cdf apply this technique to 2.2 and 2.7 fb@xmath9 of data to find , respectively , @xmath47 gev @xcite and @xmath48 gev @xcite .",
    "the likelihood for the data to be consistent with various top quark mass and jet energy calibration hypotheses is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : topmass ] ( only a subset of the d  data is presented in the plot ) .",
    "while the above are the most precise single mass measurements , it is important to measure the top quark mass in a variety of final states , since the presence of new physics may lead to inconsistencies . to that end , both d  and cdf have applied the matrix element method to events in the dilepton final state . with 2.0 fb@xmath9 of data , cdf measures @xmath49 gev @xcite while d  uses a sample of up to 2.8 fb@xmath9 to measure @xmath50 gev @xcite , consistent with the measurements in the lepton plus jets channel .",
    "cdf has also performed a measurement of the top quark mass using the all jets channel  @xcite .",
    "though it has the largest @xmath0 branching ratio , this mode is difficult to extract from the large multijet background .",
    "cdf combines @xmath1 jet identification with a kinematic neural network selection to this channel , and extracts the top quark mass from a full kinematic reconstruction of the final state . as with the lepton plus jets mode , hadronic",
    "@xmath3 decays provide an _ in situ _ measurement of the jet energy calibration .",
    "the result of the measurement is @xmath51 gev .",
    "in addition , cdf has measured the top quark mass using the distributions in lepton @xmath5 and @xmath1 decay length  @xcite .",
    "these variables are independent of the jet energy calibration , and so the systematic uncertainties in this measurement are largely uncorrelated with those in the other measurements .",
    "the result is @xmath52 gev . while this is currently less precise than the matrix element results , such techniques should be valuable at the lhc .",
    "the above ( and previous ) measurements are combined by the tevatron electroweak working group to obtain a world - average top quark mass of @xmath53 gev , with a precision of 0.7% @xcite . using this value as one of the inputs to a global fit of electroweak parameters of the sm",
    ", the lep electroweak working group finds that the higgs boson mass is constrained to be less than 154 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite . if the direct search from lep is taken as a prior probability , this upper limit increases to 185 gev .",
    "+      the distribution of the rapidity difference @xmath54 is expected to have a small deviation from symmetry about @xmath55 .",
    "this asymmetry arises from interference effects between production diagrams at nlo , and can be quantified by : @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the numbers of events with positive and negative values of @xmath59 . in the sm",
    ", @xmath60 is expected to be of the order 5 - 10% , but new physics could significantly increase this value .",
    "both cdf and d  measure @xmath60 using lepton plus jets events .",
    "event selection and reconstruction can alter the distribution of @xmath59 , so that the apparent value of @xmath60 differs from its true value .",
    "cdf and d  take different approaches to addressing this issue , with cdf choosing to unfold its measured asymmetry under the assumption that the production is according to the sm , while d  reports its measured asymmetry and provides a prescription for modeling the distortion of any true @xmath59 distribution .",
    "this difference means that the results reported by the two experiments can not be compared directly .",
    "cdf performs two measurements using 1.9 fb@xmath9 of data , with the asymmetry determined in the @xmath0 and @xmath4 rest frames .",
    "the former analysis yields @xmath61% and the latter @xmath62% .",
    "d  measures @xmath60 using 0.9 fb@xmath63 of data , and finds @xmath64% .",
    "both cdf and d  have searched for heavy particles that decay into @xmath0 by reconstructing the invariant mass of the @xmath0 system @xmath65 .",
    "a resonance would appear as a localized excess in the @xmath65 distribution .",
    "this has been studied at cdf and d  using 1.9 and 2.1 fb@xmath9 of data , respectively  @xcite .",
    "neither experiment finds evidence for resonant @xmath0 production , and they set limits on such resonances .",
    "cdf expresses the limits as restrictions on heavy gluons as a function of the gluon mass and coupling to the top quark .",
    "d  expresses the limits in terms of a @xmath66 resonance , and finds that if a @xmath66 exists , it must have a mass @xmath67 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "although the sm has only three generations of fermions , there may in fact be additional generations of massive fermions .",
    "cdf searches for a fourth - generation analogue to the top quark ( the @xmath68 quark ) in 2.8 fb@xmath9 of data , assuming that this quark is strongly pair - produced and decays to @xmath69  @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the experimental signature for @xmath70 production is similar to that of @xmath0 production , with the exception that @xmath68 events would have more energetic jets and leptons and a larger reconstructed quark mass . comparing the two - dimensional distribution of reconstructed mass versus the sum of the jet and lepton @xmath5 values in lepton plus jet events , cdf finds no evidence for a deviation from the sm expectation , and sets a lower limit on the mass of a @xmath68 of 311 gev at 95% c.l ..      for the @xmath71 coupling of the sm , the @xmath3 boson arising from top quark decay should have helicity 0 70% of the time , helicity -1 30% of the time , and a only a negligible contribution from helicity + 1 .",
    "departures from @xmath71 for the @xmath13 coupling alter these fractions .",
    "both cdf and d  have measured the @xmath3 helicity fractions by reconstructing the angle @xmath72 between the up - type fermion and top quark directions in the @xmath3 boson rest frame .",
    "the cdf measurement is based on two analyses of lepton plus jets events : one in which the distribution of @xmath73 is unfolded and compared directly to the theoretical prediction  @xcite , and the other in which mc templates are used to extract the underlying helicity fractions from the observed distribution  @xcite .",
    "d s measurement uses the lepton plus jets and @xmath74 channels , taking advantage of information from both @xmath3 bosons in each event in a template fit to the data .",
    "all the analyses simultaneously fit the fractions @xmath75 and @xmath76 of @xmath3 bosons with helicity 0 and + 1 . combining its two analysis  @xcite , cdf finds @xmath77 ( stat .",

    "since there are no neutrinos in this final state , the event can be fully reconstructed .",
