    "large scale cosmological simulations offer the prospect of constraining theories of galaxy formation and probing the appropriateness of cosmological parameters .",
    "however , hydrodynamical and n@xmath1body simulations meet various difficulties in fitting observations .",
    "the reasons for these difficulties is that there are many physical processes and timescales which are not well understood such as : the appropriate initial conditions for the models , the detailed structure of dark matter halos , the timescale over which mass is accumulated into the halo and onto the galaxy , how stars form in detail , the relative role of major and minor mergers and their importance over cosmic time , the effect of the density of the galaxian environment and the impact of stellar and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) feedback .",
    "radio galaxies are known to be massive elliptical types which formed in the early universe @xcite .",
    "the puzzling hubble @xmath7  diagram , which is bounded on the bright side principally by powerful radio galaxies @xcite , allowed us to identify in the comoving rest@xmath1frame the population of elliptical galaxies .",

    "the mid@xmath1ir , far@xmath1ir and sub@xmath1millimeter emission from distant radio galaxies were interpreted as starbursts mainly initiated by major mergers @xcite .",
    "these dichotomous results : the old population from the hubble @xmath7  diagram and the young population from the need for high rates of star formation in radio galaxies imply that we are required to simultaneously follow the passive evolution of the galaxy as well as that of the on@xmath1going starburst to explain the overall spectral energy distribution ( sed ) . to do this simultaneously",
    "requires a refined spectrophotometric model such as our new version of pgase .",
    "the code pgase.3 offers the possibility to interpret observations in the observer s frame by using uv - to - submm synthetic libraries built for a wide range of ages .",
    "the template seds take into account the local z=0 templates corrected for evolution of the stellar population ( e@xmath1correction ) and redshift ( k@xmath1correction ) . in the present paper we tackle a precise , heretofore still debated key issue - namely whether the most distant galaxies , including radio galaxies , are pure starbursts initiated by on@xmath1going mergers or are forming stars continuously on timescales longer than that generally appropriate for mergers . in radio galaxies , there is also the additional difficulty of the thermal emission from the agn ( perhaps a torus ) and of the scattered light from the agn which both contribute to the overall spectral energy distribution , especially in the mid@xmath1ir and uv respectively @xcite .",
    "we chose two radio galaxies in particular , 4c  41.17 and tn  j2007@xmath11316 , both at z=3.8 , because of their small agn contribution to the overall sed .",
    "we apply the following two selection criteria : ( i ) relatively faint scattered light contribution in the rest - frame uv as determined from polarimetric measurements .",
    "polarimetric measurements are the only way to ensure that the continuum is mostly of stellar origin .",
    "indeed those two galaxies are the only cases where a clear signature of photospheric absorption lines has been detected @xcite ( ii ) faint contribution of the agn in the rest - frame 8 - 12@xmath11 m range of the sed . to fit the sed , one and two",
    "stellar components are successively tried from an automatic procedure which minimizes the @xmath12 .",
    "we focus on the main properties ( type , mass , age and star - formation history ) of the two stellar populations . in   2 , we present the observations of the two radio galaxies for which we have built the continuous optical - ir - submm seds after correcting for instrumental effects ( differing apertures , flux calibrations , etc . ) . pgase.3 and",

    "  4 presents the best fit results of seds in the observer s frame obtained using two evolved stellar populations plus a simple agn model . finally , we provide some thoughts on the implications of these results in   5 and our conclusions in the last section .",

    "the two radio galaxies 4c  41.17 ( @xmath14 ) and tn  j2007@xmath11316 ( @xmath15 ) are part of the sample of ultra - steep spectrum radio sources ( uss ; @xmath16 ; @xmath17 ) designed specifically to increase the probability of discovering distant , @xmath18 , radio galaxies @xcite .",
    "the two targets were specifically selected because of their relatively low level of agn activity in the rest - frame uv / optical and their strong photospheric and dust signatures respectively seen in their optical continuum emission and in the cold dust - grain dominated far - ir emission .",

    "for the two galaxies the synchrotron emission is considered as negligible in the wavelength domain hereafter analyzed due to the steep radio spectra of the cores .",

    "the huge stellar mass @xmath4 2.210@xmath34m@xmath9  corresponds to a rapid metal - enrichment from a no - primitive cloud ( @xmath35 ) .",

    "all these values are compatible with our stellar population model , favoring the jet cloud interaction model for triggering star formation at high redshift .",
    "another favorable argument for this scenario , at a much lower rate , is the star formation by jet - cloud interaction discovered in the core of ngc 1068 with the high angular resolution of naco/_vlt _ @xcite .",

    "the authors propose that cold clouds entrained in the galaxy disk outflow . at high redshifts ,",
    "star formation activity is intense enough at the earliest epochs to induce intense winds which may also entrain the molecular and neutral atomic hydrogen driving it out of the galaxy .",

    "the new important result is the emergence in the mid - ir ( optical rest - frame ) of an ( already evolved ) stellar component .",

    "the age and huge stellar mass of this old population is calibrated on the seds of two selected radio galaxies , in particular when galactic winds are imposed . at age of @xmath331gyr ,",

    "all these results favor the presence of highly massive early type galaxies initiated at early epochs z@xmath4210 , which must have grown very rapidly .",
    "because the insufficient time resolution , the declining continuous star formation laws , as used in pgase.3 and other codes could also be considered as a series of successive starbursts with intensities declining with time . from this point of view ,",
    "which is also consistent with the data , the hierarchical assembly history of most massive ( @xmath338@xmath3710@xmath8 m@xmath9 ) haloes in a @xmath333  gpc@xmath43  volume as proposed in @xcite to form populations of z=6 quasars would be compatible with our results .",
    "the discovery of these @xmath0 old stellar component in powerful radio galaxies with a superposed starburst in a high density medium , warrants a comparison with radio - quiet early - type high-@xmath44 galaxies .",
    "these radio quiet galaxies have median stellar masses of @xmath334@xmath37 10@xmath45 m@xmath9 at z=2.0 - 2.7 @xcite .",
    "their mass estimates are likely underestimated because observations were through the gemini k@xmath46  filter , missing the population of dominant rest - frame k - band emission redshifted in the _ spitzer _ filters .",
    "however the comparison with powerful radio galaxies is justified because their respective masses are of the same order .",
    "moreover deep and high - resolution images obtained with _ hst_/nicmos and /nic2 and keck @xcite are associated to the presence of massive disks of old stars at high redshift of remarkably small sizes with a median effective radius , @xmath47=0.9kpc .",
    "cosmological surface brightness dimming has a strong impact on the perceived morphology of distant galaxies and likely explains generally why disks are basically undetectable at z@xmath48 1.5 .",
    "the decrement in surface brightness due to cosmological dimming is of @xmath4 7 magnitudes at redshift 3.8 .",
    "only the central disk and spheroidal components are of sufficiently high surface brightness to be detectable even in deep images @xcite .",
    "if radio - load galaxies are a subpopulation of the massive radio - quiet galaxies which are undergoing an episode of vigorous star formation , it may well be that the powerful agn illuminate the surrounding gas and dust in the disk over larger scales than would not otherwise be visible due to surface brightness dimming .",
    "even the continuum emission would be affected due to scattering of the agn continuum by dust . moreover , in the population of radio - quiet massive galaxies , the stellar population does not have the massive young stellar component we have observed in ir - luminous powerful radio galaxies , and therefore would be less luminous in both the far - ir and in the optical perhaps below the threshold of the detectability .",
    "the massive evolved starburst in ir - luminous powerful radio galaxies contribute to the illumination of the disk over larger scales , sticking out of the surface brightness threshold .",
    "observing extended emission preferentially in radio galaxies confirms the coexistence of the radio and starburst activity in the short star forming episode perhaps initiated by gas - rich mergers . of course , the jet would also have an impact through its interaction with the surrounding gas , compressing and heating it",
    "this shaping of the gas by the radio jet may also lead to stronger extended emission in both the emission lines and continuum .    more knowledge on kinematics and apparent morphology strongly modified by distance effects",
    "are also required for justifying the spheroidal structure of early - type galaxies . in case of radio galaxies ,",
    "all these properties have to be associated to the presence of a supermassive black hole .",

    "from the pgase.3 evolutionary spectral synthesis of two @xmath0 radio galaxies , the sed fitting on a large wavelength coverage ( uv / optical to far - ir / submm ) , identifies two distinct stellar components .",
    "the originality and specificity of the analysis is to work in the observer s frame by using robust local templates , corrected at high @xmath44for the universe expansion ( k - corrected ) and evolution due to distance ( e - corrected ) , following scenario librairies by types of the code pgase.3 . at any time , synthetic templates are continuously computed with coherent uv / optical stellar emission and dust absorption reemitted in the far - ir .",

    "<S> using the new evolutionary code pgase.3 , we made an evolutionary spectral synthesis of the optical - ir - submm spectral energy distribution of two distant ( @xmath0 ) radio galaxies , 4c  41.17 and tn  j2007@xmath11316 . </S>",
    "<S> these two radio galaxies were selected from the herg ( herschel radio galaxies evolution ) project in particular for their faint agn contribution and because they show evidence of a large stellar contribution to their bolometric luminosity . </S>",
    "<S> pgase.3 coherently models the reprocessing of the stellar luminosity to dust emission allowing us to build uv - to - ir - submm spectral energy distribution libraries which then can be used to fit spectral energy distributions in the observer s frame . </S>",
    "<S> our principal conclusion is that a single stellar population is insufficient to fit the spectral energy distributions of either radio galaxy . </S>",
    "<S> our best fits are a sum of two evolving stellar populations  a recent starburst plus an old population  plus the thermal emission from an active galactic nucleus ( which provides a good fit to the mid - ir emission ) . </S>",
    "<S> the two stellar components are : i ) a massive ( @xmath2m@xmath3 ) starburst @xmath430 myrs after formation , which is required simultaneously to fit the far - ir _ herschel _ to submm data and the optical data ii ) an older massive ( @xmath5m@xmath3 ) early - type galaxy population , @xmath4   1.0gyr old , which is required principally to fit the mid - ir _ spitzer_/irac data . </S>",
    "<S> a young population alone is insufficient because an evolved giant - star population produces a 1@xmath6 m rest - frame peak which is observed in the irac photometry . </S>",
    "<S> this discovery confirms that much of the stellar populations in high redshift radio galaxies are formed by massive starbursts in the early universe . </S>",
    "<S> gas - rich mergers and/or jet - cloud interactions are favored for triggering the intense star formation necessary to explain the properties of their spectral energy distributions . </S>",
    "<S> the discovery of similar characteristics in two distant radio galaxies suggests that multiple stellar populations , one old and one young , may be a generic feature of the luminous infrared radio galaxy population as a whole .    </S>",
