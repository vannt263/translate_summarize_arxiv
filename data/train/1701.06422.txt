    "in a strongly scattering material , light rays follow different paths in the material , each path being composed of numerous scattering events ( see fig .  [ light_speckle ] ) . when the source is coherent ,",
    "the light transmitted through or backscattered from a disorder system gives rise to interferences and the collected intensities display a speckle figure ( see fig .  [ light_speckle ] ) .",
    "the scattered light rays have performed a random walk inside the material and thus have explored a part of the bulk of the material .",
    "if the system has an internal dynamics ( typically brownian motion for a colloidal suspension ) the speckle figure will change with time .",
    "the principle of the _ diffusing - wave spectroscopy _ ( dws ) is to analyze the fluctuations of the scattered intensity in order to extract information about the structure or dynamics of the system  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the analysis is based on the calculation of the auto - correlation function @xmath0 of the scattered intensities .",
    "the correlations are calculated between two states of the sample that we will call 1 and 2 in the following : @xmath1 the average operation @xmath2 in equation  [ eq_def_gi ] can be performed over time ( it is then supposed that the phenomenon studied is ergodic ) , or over an ensemble of speckles  @xcite . in the multi - speckles method",

    "scattering is at play , no information on the details of the scattering process inside the material can be infered , contrary to single scattering technics .",
    "nevertheless , information can still be extracted through a modeling of the propagation of light in the material . in this case , the models are based on the hypothesis that the propagation of the light inside the sample can be described as a diffusion process  @xcite . although the diffusion process causes the loss of most of the detailed information about the material in which it propagates , this process is also at the origin of the unmatchable sensitivity of the method .",
    "usually , the sensitivity of an interferometric method is of the order of the wavelength of the coherent source used .",
    "indeed , a loss of correlation between two interferometric figures corresponds typically to the change from constructive interferences to destructive ones , _",
    "i.e. _ to a change between the ray paths of the order of one wavelength .",
    "but as multiple scattering implies a large number of scattering events , decorrelation will occur when the scatterers will have move only of a fraction of the wavelength .",
    "consequently , relative displacements of a few nanometers of the scatterers are measurable  @xcite .",
    "considering the field at a point on a sensor , its amplitude @xmath6 is the sum of a large number of rays @xmath7 .",
    "the correlation function of the amplitudes is : @xmath8 when averaging , the contribution from @xmath9 will vanish because the fields @xmath10 originating from different paths ( @xmath11 ) can be considered as uncorrelated . consequently : @xmath12 which means that the statistical properties of the fluctuations depend only of the phase variation of each paths .",
    "consequently , understanding the form of the correlation function necessitate to calculate the typical phase variation of a path .",
    "experimentally the correlation is calculated over the intensities . when the scattered field @xmath6 has a gaussian distribution , the correlation functions on amplitudes , @xmath13 , and the ones on intensities , @xmath0 , are linked by the siegert relation  @xcite : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an experimental constant of order unity depending on the details of the experimental setup  @xcite .",

    "this distribution is related to the transport of light into the granular material . during the propagation of light into the granular material",
    ", the light is scattered many times . in the limit of a very high multiple scattering , photons are scattered a large number of times , and paths are random walks . in this case , the light propagation may be then described using the diffusion approximation . solving this equation permits to find the function @xmath30 for various geometries  @xcite .",

    "it could seem surprising and even impossible that imaging can be performed when multiple scattering is at play .",
    "the principle is the following one .",
    "first and most importantly , we exploit the fact that in the backscattering configuration most of the paths are short : half the photons exit the sample at a distance @xmath120 from their entering point  @xcite .",
    "this feature could be considered as a drawback as the multiple scattering assumption underlying the theory might fail down , but in fact , the theory is surprisingly robust and we can take advantage of this feature to obtain spatial resolution .",
    "second , we use a near field speckles set - up which allows to image the side of a sample .",
    "historically , study of the speckle fluctuations in the image plane has been done in biomedical context  @xcite , but generally the dynamics is too fast to be resolved  @xcite : the method can be directly applied only in the case when speckle dynamics vary slowly between the two states  @xcite .",
    "finally , we use a multispeckle scheme to compute correlations between two states of deformation of a material  @xcite ( see section  [ sec : dws_princ ] ) . because of the use of ccd cameras in order to collect simultaneously numerous speckle images , dark noise corrections are necessary when computing the correlation functions . the procedure to perform such corrections",
    "is described in references  @xcite .",
    "the principle of the method is as following : the sample is illuminated by coherent light and a side of the sample is imaged using a camera at different states of the material .",

    "i.e. _ deformation larger than @xmath124 .",
    "the values of the deformation are obtained using equation  .",
    "the size of the speckles @xmath125 can be chosen independently of the magnification chosen to image the sample .",
    "the optimal size of the speckles is the result of a balance between the fact that the coherence areas have to be larger than the size of a pixel of the camera and that if speckles are too large , the information provided by different pixels of the camera is redundant .",
    "viasnoff et al .",
    "@xcite have shown that the optimal speckle spot diameter @xmath125 is of 3 pixels . practically , we chose coherence areas of sizes between 2 and 3 pixels ( see section  [ sec : tutorial ] ) .",
    "the optimal spatial resolution is obtained when a meta - pixel in the image corresponds to a size @xmath35 on the object .",
    "the choice of the lens magnification is then the result of a compromize between the number of speckles in a metapixel @xmath126 , which determines the statistics for ensemble averages and the size of the area to be studied which is determined by the lens magnification @xmath127 .    a detailed discussion of an example of dimensioning of a setup is given in reference  @xcite .",
    "despite the apparent simplicity of the dws experiment , certain difficulties can arise when implementing it for the first time . in this section",

    "for the demonstration we performed a spatially resolved dws experiment on granular sample that was locally subjected to dilational expansion under heating .",
    "we can expect that the speckle evolves , inducing a decorrelation of the scattered intensity .",

    "the image of the surface of the sample is formed ( magnification ratio @xmath133 ) on the camera sensor ( prosilica gc2450 , resolution @xmath134 , square pixels of size @xmath135 ) .",
    "a monochromatic filter is placed in front of the camera to eliminate the stray light .        concerning the camera setting ,",
    "special attention should be paid to the resulting size of a speckle spot , which can be tuned by the aperture of the diaphragm .",
    "the optimal balance between the signal - to - noise level and the optical contrast of the image can be obtained for a speckle of @xmath136 pixels in diameter@xcite .",
    "its size can be measured by performing 2d - fast fourier transform ( fft ) of a speckle pattern image .",
    "the analysis gives the information on the frequency of the intensity spatial distribution .",
    "the lower the spatial frequency the higher number of pixels corresponds to one speckle and the more the image is blurred .",
    "in contrast , high spatial frequency corresponds to a small speckle size .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : speckles ] .",
    "the fourier transform of the scattered intensity is the exit pupil of the imaging setup , i.e. the circular diaphragm  @xcite .",
    "the speckle size is @xmath137 and @xmath138 pixels for the images of figure  [ fig : speckles](a ) and ( b ) respectively .",
    "we set it to @xmath136  pixels in the following .",
    "another important parameter to be set is the frame time .",
    "on one hand it should provide a good time resolution for the experiment and fit to the rate of the dynamical process under investigation . on the other hand ,",
    "if images are acquired at too high a framerate , successive speckle images are identical .",
    "since we expect that thermal diffusion occurs on time scale of few seconds , we set the frame rate to 1 image per second .",
    "images are taken before , during and after the sample heating .",
    "therefore the undisturbed state of the beads , loss of the correlation and its following recovery have been tracked during the experiment .",
    "we recall that to obtain the correlation map , the images are first divided in metapixels and the correlation function are computed for each metapixel between two different states of the sample , here between two successive images .",
    "maps of correlation function are done on zones of @xmath139 pixels , corresponding to @xmath140 speckles spots .",
    "a length of @xmath141 pixels on the camera corresponds to @xmath142    the correlation maps corresponding to each phases of the experiment are shown in the upper part of the figure [ fig : stack ] .",
    "they are presented in the grayscale where the brightness of a pixel stands for the value of the correlation function .",
    "the map ( a ) corresponds to a moment before the thermal deformation has been induced .",
    "it reveals the absence of any dynamics in the system and the value of the correlation function is close to 1 .",
    "for all the pictures taken during the heating ( the map ( b ) as an example ) the signal coming from the illuminated zone is totally randomized and within this area the value of the correlation function drops to 0 .",
    "the true magnitude of decorrelation under beads thermal expansion is not so high , however it is hidden under the emission of the white light .",
    "the proper values of the correlation left in the system can be retrieved from the map once the illumination is off ( figure [ fig : stack ] ( c ) ) . in the following the heat",
    "is conducted into the bulk of the sample balancing the temperature gradient along the sample surface .",
    "the activity in the system slows down and the correlation is getting recovered as it can be seen on the map ( d ) .",
    "it continues further and at some point the situation comes back to the state ( a ) . +     along the magenta line during the relaxation process .",
    "different colors correspond to different times .",
    "solid lines : fit of each profile by a gaussian function . ]    since the rate of the correlation recovery depends on the thermal diffusivity of a medium , this parameter can be retrieved from the obtained data .",
    "for that we monitor the variation of the correlation function along a slice of the correlation map passing through the heated zone . in the figure",
    "[ fig : stack ] such a slice is indicated with the magenta line .",
    "the temporal fluctuation of the correlation function along this slice is presented in the bottom part of the figure by stacking the lines of the full recording in a spatio - temporal diagram . here",
    "the number of pixel rows correspond to the length of the slice and the number of columns corresponds to the number of images taken during the experiment .",
    "the three phases of the experiment ( before heating , during and after ) are clearly seen in the stack and indicated as zones i , ii and iii , correspondingly .",
    "we are interested in the zone iii , where the recovery of the correlation occurs .",
    "several profiles of the slices in zone iii are plotted with circles in figure  [ fig : exp_graph ] ( a ) .",
    "different colours corresponds to different images and therefore to different times .",
    "the profiles have been fitted with the gaussian function for which the amplitude of the peak ( noted as @xmath143 ) is associated with the magnitude of the thermal deformation and consequently with the temperature gradient .",
    "the amplitude @xmath143 decreases exponentially with a relaxation time is @xmath144 , corresponding to the time of heat diffusion into the bulk . from reported values of thermal conductivity for glass beads  @xcite we may deduce a thermal diffusivity @xmath145 .",
    "we then find @xmath146 , which is in agreement with the probed depth into the sample which is few @xmath35 .    such experiment can be easily implemented with standard lab equipment and allows to practice dws measurement on a predictible configuration . in the next section",
    ", we present some examples of measurements that have been done using dws method .",
    "all those results have been extensively described and discussed in other publications and we present them here to illustrate the potential of the method .",
    "in this section , we present briefly measurements that have been done in different configuration to image granular samples submitted to different kind of loadings .      a standard configuration to test failure of a granular material in soil mechanics is the biaxial test : a sample submitted to a confining pressure is unixially compressed . in this case",
    ", the granular material is confined between two walls ensuring plane strain conditions ( see figure  [ biaxial](a ) ) .",
    "when the material fails it presents shear bands .",
    "figure  [ fig : comp](a ) shows a typical correlation map obtained using dws after the failure of the material displaying two conjugated shear bands .",
    "the mechanical response of the material can be schematically considered as solid blocks moving relatively as shown in the right part of figure  [ fig : biaxial ] .",
    "we have performed in this experiment two complementary measurements : dws measurements as described in the present review but also particle image velocimetry .",
    "the second method allows a direct measurement of the displacement field .",
    "an example of which , after average , is shown in figure  [ fig : comp](b ) .",
    "we observe that the displacement field obtained by particle image velocimetry coincidates with the strain map .",
    "the results allow to show that the dws method gives a measurement of _ relative _ displacements explaining the fact that the part of the material that are in solid translation stay correlated in average .",
    "indeed , a solid translation of 1 @xmath129 m of the scatterers results in a translation of the speckle pattern in the image plane of less than 3  % of one pixel size . consequently , the contribution of this translation to the decorrelation is neglectible",
    ".    a detailed study of the response of material during this test can be found in references  @xcite .",
    "another standard configuration for studying failure in a granular material is a progressive inclination a box filled with beads ( see figure  [ prec_setup ] ) .",
    "the goal is then to identify the plastic mechanisms that precede the destabilization of the pile in an avalanche . in this system ,",
    "small rearrangements as well as regular large micro - ruptures have been evidenced before the avalanche  @xcite .",
    "our observations using dws evidenced that localized rearrangements are present from the very beginning of the tilting process and occur at all depths in the sample . at a given depth",
    ", the density of the rearrangements increases with the shear , while at a given angle the density of the rearrangements decreases with the depth .",
    "we have also observed large events implying typically a part of the material parallel to the surface .",
    "such micro - rupture can be seen in figure  [ prec_film ] at 25.63@xmath147 .",
    "the successive correlation maps surrounding the micro - rupture are given , showing how the details of the plastic processes at play during such micro - ruptures can be identified .",
    "the micro - rupture phenomenenology is mainly a function of the depth @xmath148 under the free surface so that a spatio - temporal representation obtained by averaging the values of the correlation at each depth @xmath148 allows a good visualization of the behavior of the sample during the quasi - static tilting of the pile ( see fig .",
    "[ prec_film](b ) ) .",
    "we observe regularly spaced large events .",
    "the depth of those events increases linearly with the angle of inclination until the avalanche .",
    "those events occur from an angle @xmath149 typically around 15@xmath147 , independently from the type of material , revealing an internal threshold well below the avalanche angle .",
    "an extensive study in this configuration can be found in reference  @xcite .",
    "the unmatchable resolution on deformation allows here to identify processes of very small amplitude . when studying precursors to catastrophic events , having access to such minute local deformation is crucial to resolve the internal plasticity before the failure .",
    "an unsolved question in granular matter is the problem of the elastic limit of a non - cohesive granular material and of the response of this material when submitted to cycles of force of a very small amplitude . to separate the elastic , reversible , part from the plastic , irreversible one in dws measurements , an image of reference",
    "can be used to compute all the correlations instead of studying only the incremental deformation between consecutive images .",
    "it is then possible to measure the recovered correlation during a cycle and to separate it from the irreversible loss of correlation during a cycle . to underline this difference in the present study in comparison to the previous ones we use a different colormap here :",
    "red corresponds to the maximal correlation ( @xmath150 ) while dark blue corresponds to full decorrelation ( @xmath151 ) ( see colorscale in figure  [ fig : marion_failure ] ) . in such study ,",
    "a limitation can arise from the temporal stability of the laser that can limit the maximal time lag possible between two images .",
    "we have studied the mechanical response of a granular pile to a localized force and we have characterized experimentally the main differences between the response of a granular sample and of an elastic reference media  @xcite . the experimental setup is shown on figure  [ marion_setup](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "the upper row of figure  [ fig : marion_failure ] shows the observed spatial repartition of the deformation using always the initial speckle image from the unloaded sample as a reference for a maximal value of the force during the ramp for which we have observed failure .",
    "we observed inhomogeneities in the otherwise regular response that we interpret as precursors of the rupture .",
    "as in the previous example , all the interest of dws measurements is the possibility to study the intermittent heterogeneous dynamics that precedes the failure .",
    "we have presented pedagogically how to measure deformation in granular materials using dws .",
    "we have given the basic tools both on the theoretical side and on the very practical side for the reader to be able to implement this method in the lab .",
    "we have given a short review of the principle of diffusing wave spectroscopy .",
    "we have discuss in more details the case of deformation in granular materials with special interest on how scattering take place in granular matter and how to take into account uncorrelated motion in addition to an affine deformation field when analysing the correlation functions .",
    "we have presented in details a tutorial experiments with practical tips on the adjustment of the setup .",
    "finally we have briefly presented some observations done using this method in various experimental setups implying granular materials .",
