    "many social , biological , and communication systems can be properly described as complex networks with nodes representing individuals or organizations and links mimicking the interactions among them[1 - 3 ] .",
    "examples are numerous : these include the internet[4,5 ] , the world wide web[6,7 ] , biological networks[8,9 ] , food webs[10 ] , social networks[11 ] , etc .",
    "recent empirical studies indicate that the networks in various fields exhibit some common topological characteristics : a small average distance as random networks , large clustering coefficient as regular networks ( small - world property)[12 ] and a power - law degree distribution ( scale - free property)[13 ] .",
    "the ubiquity of complex networks has inspired tremendous investigations on them . among these flourishing researches ,",
    "the effect of aging is of particular interest[14 - 18 ] , since it is a universal mechanism in reality .",
    "for instance , in the movie actor collaboration network , the more famous an actor is , the more chances he will have to act in new movies .",
    "but , no matter how famous he may be , every star will become gradually inactive as time goes on .",
    "this aging effect can greatly influence the evolution of networks and results in peculiar network structural property[14,15 ] .",
    "recently , brner _",
    "et al_. introduced a general process model that simultaneously grows coauthor and paper citation networks[19 ] , in which the core assumption is that the twin networks of scientific researchers and academic articles mutually support one another . in their model ,",
    "each of the authors and papers is assigned a topic , and authors read , cite , produce papers or coauthor with others only in their own topic area .",
    "interestingly , they found that the clustering coefficient @xmath2 of the simulated paper citation network is linearly correlated with the number of topics .",
    "we note that the main underlying dynamic rule governing the evolution of the network is aging .",
    "for example , due to the lifespan of human , once authors are older than a specified age , they will be set deactivated , and do not produce papers or coauthor with others any longer .",
    "furthermore , papers cease to receive links when their contents are outdated .",
    "therefore , these considerations motivate us to theoretically investigate the effect of aging on the clustering coefficient of the network . in the present paper ,",
    "we concentrate on this ingredient of self - organization of the coauthor and paper citation networks and propose a simple generalized model , in which the main dynamic is deactivation mechanism .",
    "we will demonstrate that the behavior of clustering coefficient @xmath2 in the coauthor and paper citation networks is universal in networks generated by deactivation mechanism .",

    "the evolution process starts with a one - dimensional lattice consisting of @xmath1 active nodes with periodic boundary condition and coordination number @xmath3[22 ] .",
