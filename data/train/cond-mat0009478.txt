    "quantum tunneling of a spin or spin - like degree of freedom has been discussed for over a decade now @xcite , but unambiguous evidence for its existence has only come recently @xcite from studies on the magnetic molecule [ fe@xmath1o@xmath2(oh)@xmath0(tacn)@xmath3@xmath4 ( 8 for short ) .",
    "this molecule has a total spin @xmath5 , is biaxially symmetric , and can be modeled by the spin hamiltonian @xmath6 with @xmath7 . in the first approximation , it has two degenerate ground states , approximately given by @xmath8 , which are separated by an energy barrier in the _ xy_-plane .",
    "the question of interest is to understand how these states are admixed by quantum tunneling .",
    "direct numerical diagonalization of using the experimentally determined values @xmath9  k , @xmath10  k @xcite reveals that the tunnel splitting @xmath11 is @xmath12  k , which is too small to be observed directly .",
    "wernsdorfer and sessoli @xcite overcome this difficulty by applying a small amplitude ac magnetic field along the @xmath13 direction , which causes the @xmath8 levels to cross one another .",
    "transitions between these levels are now possible via the landau - zener - stckelberg ( lzs ) process@xcite , and the underlying tunneling matrix element @xmath11 can be deduced from a measurement of the incoherent lzs relaxation rate for the total magnetization . the key experimental fact that supports this interpretation of the relaxation ( which could after all be due to a classical activation process a priori ) , is a systematic and remarkable oscillatory dependence of the inferred splitting @xmath11 on the strength of the magnetic field @xmath14 when this field is applied along the hard direction @xmath15 .",
    "this phenomon was predicted some time ago @xcite based on an instanton approach .",
    "briefly , when @xmath16 , there are two symmetry related instanton paths that wind around @xmath15 in opposite directions , and together form a closed loop on the ( complexified ) unit sphere .",
    "the actions for the instantons are complex , and differ by a real valued berry phase given by @xmath17 times the area of the loop , giving rise to interference @xcite .",
    "now , however , the berry phase is not fixed at @xmath18 , but may be continuously varied by varying @xmath19 . as a function of @xmath19 ,",
    "therefore , the tunnel splitting oscillates , and is completely quenched at values of @xmath19 where the berry phase is an odd integer times @xmath20 .    in this paper , we wish to study topological quenching of tunneling in a second magnetic molecule , mn@xmath0-acetate ( or 12 for short ) , which has also been the subject of several experimental studies @xcite .",
    "the reason for our interest in 12 is that , in contrast to 8 , it has tetragonal symmetry .",
    "the spin hamiltonian of 12 can be written as = -as_z^2 - bs_z^4 + c(s_+^4 + s_-^4 ) , [ mn12 ] where @xmath21 .",
    "the easy axis @xmath13 now has four fold symmetry , the hard axes are @xmath22 and @xmath23 , and the medium axes are the lines @xmath24 in the @xmath25-plane . here , the symmetry of a pair of instanton paths is preserved when a magnetic field is applied along one of the four hard axes .",
    "thus , the quenched spin tunneling phenomenon is also anticipated in 12 . whether it can be observed or not depends on how strong the environmental decoherence is , and is a question that we shall not investigate here .    to investigate the topological quenching of the spin tunneling in 12 molecules we use the discrete phase integral ( dpi ) ( or , discrete wkb ) method@xcite .",
    "the dpi method has been applied to spin tunneling problems in a recent series of works by one of us ( ag ) @xcite .",
    "this method is semiclassical just as the instanton approach is , but it is easier to use for the study of the splittings of higher pairs of levels .",
    "it is particularly well suited to study tunneling when * h * is not along the hard axis . as in 8 , we anticipate that @xmath11 will be quenched at a number of such field values @xcite , which correspond to non - trivial diabolical points@xcite in the magnetic field space . in this paper , however , we shall not consider such general orientations of the field as the calculations for @xmath26 are already quite complex .    in the following section we present the dpi formalism for the present model . unlike the previously studied model for 8 ,",
    "the schrdinger equation corresponding to the spin hamiltonian for mn@xmath0-ac becomes a nine - term recursion relation because of the fourth - order term .",
    "we give a systematic analysis for this recursion relation .",
    "we then calculate the tunnel splittings as a function of the applied field for the first few energy levels .",
    "the results will be compared with those obtained by numerical diagonalization of the spin hamiltoian . in sec .",
    "iii we give a qualitative discussion of spin tunneling based on the instanton approach .",
    "this gives a good physical picture of the quenched spin tunneling and explains some of the interesting features found in the dpi results .",

    "the overall pattern of zeros , their number , and the dependence of this number on @xmath211 , the pair index , is understandable on general grounds as we shall discuss .",
    "what is surprising is how regularly spaced these values of @xmath51 are . for the first pair of splittings ,",
    "e.g. , the intervals between successive zeros decrease by 2 or 3% only , and the last interval is 92% of the first . for the next pair , @xmath274 ,",
    "the last interval is 95% of the first .",
    "the mean interval between zeros for the first three pairs is @xmath275 t , @xmath276 t , @xmath277 t .",
    "the regularity of the zeros means that the phase integral @xmath269 decreases almost linearly with @xmath51 .",
    "( from fig .",
    "[ fg : splitting ] , gamow factor @xmath226 also appears to be quite linear in @xmath51 . )",
    "while this variation is clearly expected to be smooth , we have no a priori way to judge how linear it will be . a similarly strong regularity of quenching intervals",
    "is experimentally discussed in fe@xmath1 .",
    "the simplest model hamiltonian for fe@xmath1 entails only second order terms in the components of the spin operator , and in this model , the spacing of zeros _ is _ exactly equal @xcite , but to describe actual fe@xmath1 , one must add fourth - order terms .",
    "these terms change the spacing significantly , but still seem to preserve its regularity .",
    "it would be interesting to find a physical argument for this feature , which appears to be somewhat general .",
    "second , at @xmath47 the tunnel splitting alternates between zero and nonzero as the level number goes up .",
    "this is due to the fourth - order terms in the spin hamiltonian .",
    "this term causes the tunneling in the mn@xmath0 system , but it also restricts the transitions to the case that the difference , @xmath278 , between levels @xmath279 and @xmath280 is a multiple of 4 . for tunneling between degenerate states @xmath279 and @xmath281 this requires the condition @xmath282 , where @xmath283 is an integer .",
    "therefore , there is no tunneling between @xmath284 and @xmath285 when @xmath76 is an odd number .    to give a more detailed argument of this point",
    ", we note that when @xmath286 , because of the @xmath70 terms , the hamiltonian can be divided into the following subspaces for @xmath287 . @xmath288 where the numbers in brackets give the @xmath76 quantum numbers .",
    "the subspace @xmath289 contains 6 levels , which form 3 pairs split by tunneling due to the @xmath290 terms .",
    "the space @xmath291 contains 5 levels , of which @xmath292 , and @xmath293 are split by tunneling , and @xmath294 is isolated .",
    "there is no degeneracy amongst the 5 levels in space @xmath295 , but because of time reversal , this space is isomorphic to @xmath296 , and we therefore conclude that in the full spectrum of @xmath297 , there should be five pairs of _ strictly _ degenerate levels , corresponding approximately to @xmath298 with integer @xmath211 .",
    "third , there are five quenching points in the ground and first excited states tunnelings , and the number of quenching points decreases as the level number goes up . for the ground state tunneling the allowed number of quenching points can be explained qualitatively by thinking in terms of instantons . since the instanton approach also gives a good geometrical structure to the quenching we present it in a separate section .",
    "in this section we give a qualitative treatment of the spin tunneling in mn@xmath0 using instanton methods .",
    "adding a hard axis field to eq .",
    "( [ mn12 ] ) , the hamiltonian becomes @xmath299 the instanton method is based on spin coherent state path integrals . in the spin coherent state representation",
    "the anisotropy energy corresponding to the hamiltonian is given by @xmath300 where @xmath301 and @xmath302 are the polar and azimuthal angles with respect to @xmath303 , i.e. , @xmath304 the energy ( [ aniso ] ) exhibits two degenerate minima at @xmath305 and @xmath306 , where @xmath307 for @xmath308 , and decreases smoothly to @xmath309 as @xmath310 is increased .",
    "the level splitting due to tunneling between these minima can be obtained from the imaginary time propagator @xmath311 |{\\bf{\\hat n}}_i \\rangle \\nonumber \\\\&= & \\int { \\cal d}[{\\bf{\\hat n}}]\\exp[-s_e [ { \\bf{\\hat n}}(\\tau)]],\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath312 = -i s { \\cal a}[{\\bf{\\hat n}}(\\tau ) ] + \\int_0^t { \\cal{h}}_c(\\alpha , \\beta ) d \\tau,\\ ] ] with @xmath313 =   \\int_0^t ( 1 - \\cos \\alpha)\\dot{\\beta}(\\tau ) d\\tau , \\label{eq : geo}\\ ] ] is the euclidean action and complex in general . here ,",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath314 , @xmath315 . geometrically , for a closed path , the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geo ] ) can be interpreted as a surface area on the unit sphere enclosed by this path , which can be verified by stokes theorem . in the large spin limit",
    "the path integral can be approximated by the sum of all contributions from paths that minimize the action , that is , the instanton paths .",
    "the instantons for the present model are not simple because of the fourth - order terms .",
    "however , we can construct a qualitative argument to find the quenching effect without performing explicit calculations . since the euclidean action @xmath316 has both real and imaginary parts we can generally express the ground state tunnel splitting as @xmath317 where @xmath318 labels the various instantons , @xmath319 , @xmath320 are the real and imaginary parts of the instanton action , respectively , and @xmath321 are prefactors . with these ingredients",
    "we now discuss how the quenching appears in the present model .",
    "let us first consider the case when @xmath308 . since the energy has four - fold symmetry , an argument of von delft and henley can be applied @xcite . if @xmath322 is an instanton path , so is @xmath323 , where @xmath324 is a rotation through @xmath325 about @xmath326 . keeping in mind that @xmath327 is complex , when we project onto the real unit sphere , there are four saddle point paths passing through each of the four medium directions . because of symmetry",
    ", each has the same real contribution to the action integral @xmath328 .",
    "however , since their azimuths about the easy axis are different , the imaginary part of the action , i.e. , the phase @xmath329 , will not be the same . from the geometrical meaning of the integral in eq .",
    "( [ eq : geo ] ) , the phase difference between two instanton paths equals @xmath17 times the surface area on the unit sphere enclosed by these instanton paths .    to visualize the interference effect",
    "we map the two - sphere onto a plane , as in an ordinary atlas ( see fig .  [",
    "fg : phase1 ] ) .",
    "the hard axes are mapped onto four equally separated points lying on the equator , and the points exactly halfway between these correspond to the medium axes .",
    "thus , the real projections of the instanton paths can be drawn as curves which start from @xmath330 , pass through the medium points , and end at @xmath331 .",
    "the area enclosed by two adjacent instanton paths equals @xmath20 , since the sphere is equally divided into four paths by the instantons .",
    "thus , the phase difference between adjacent paths becomes @xmath332 .",
    "choosing the phase of path 1 as the base , we can perform the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) . recalling that by symmetry the contribution from real parts of the instanton actions are all same , as are the prefactors @xmath321 , we have @xmath333 where @xmath334 is an irrelevant phase .",
    "this result gives us two quenching conditions . from the factor @xmath335",
    ", we obtain the quenching of spin tunneling for half - integer @xmath17 , which is just the kramers degeneracy effect .",
    "the second cosine implies that the ground state spin tunneling is quenched for odd integer spins , i.e. , @xmath336 1,3,5 , etc , and so @xmath337 is non - zero only for @xmath338 , where @xmath283 is an integer@xcite .",
    "we now consider the case with @xmath339 . since the field is assumed to be applied along the @xmath340 axis , both easy and all four medium axes move close to @xmath340 axis .",
    "thus , the two dimensional picture becomes one as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : phase2 ] .",
    "the four - fold symmetry is now broken , but there are two pairs of instanton paths surrounding the @xmath340 axis : @xmath341 and @xmath342 .",
    "the real parts of the instanton actions in a pair are same , but different between the pairs .",
    "the phase differences in each pair are the areas enclosed by each pair of instanton paths ( the small and large oval regions in fig .",
    "[ fg : phase2 ] ) and are dependent on the field @xmath310 .",
    "if we choose the straight line joining @xmath343 to @xmath344 as a reference , @xmath345 , @xmath346 , so that the summation in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta ] ) can be performed as @xmath347 + d_b e^{-s_{rb } } \\left[e^{-is_{ib } } + e^{-is_{ib'}}\\right ] \\nonumber \\\\ & = & 2d_a e^{-s_{ra } } \\cos \\frac{sa_a(h_x)}{2 }   + 2d_b e^{-s_{rb } } \\cos \\frac{sa_b(h_x)}{2 } , \\label{eq : delta2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath348 , @xmath349 are the real parts of the instanton actions in each pair , and @xmath350 , @xmath351 are the areas enclosed by the pairs @xmath341 and @xmath352 , respectively . for @xmath353",
    "the saddle points through which the paths @xmath341 pass are lower than those for @xmath352 , which means that @xmath354 . the main contribution to @xmath337 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta2 ] ) then comes from the first term , and we can neglect the second term .",
    "the quenching of the ground state tunnel splitting thus arises when @xmath355 , where @xmath211 is a non - negative integer . to see how many quenching points are allowed we note that @xmath356 , where @xmath357 ( the area enclosed by the two paths 1 and 4 in fig .",
    "[ fg : phase1 ] ) . from this condition",
    "we find @xmath358 . for @xmath5",
    "there are thus five values of @xmath310 at which the quenching appears .",
    "the instanton argument provides another way of seeing that the region of very small ( but non - zero ) @xmath310 is special .",
    "exactly at @xmath308 , four instantons are important , but for large @xmath310 only two are important .",
    "there must therefore be a regime of small @xmath310 where we make a smooth transition between these two behaviors .",
    "the width of this regime can be quite small since @xmath359 as soon as @xmath339 , and these actions appear in the exponents in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta2 ] ) , so that the difference @xmath360 is amplified .",
    "we thus have another way of seeing why the formula ( [ formula0 ] ) fails near @xmath47 .",
    "it contains only cosine factor , and is effectively ignoring the second term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : delta2 ] ) .",
    "in this paper , we have used the dpi method to study tunneling in mn@xmath0 , especially its behavior with a hard - axis field , which is expected to show oscillation as in fe@xmath1 .",
    "the recursion relation now has nine terms , complicating the analysis .",
    "there may be up to five critical curves , which leads to many more turning points .",
    "the dpi method still works , however , even though the phase integrals and integrands must be evaluated numerically .",
    "but , the numerical procedures required are simple , and involve only root finding and integration in one variable . except for some special narrow field regions , where two or more turning points merge ,",
    "the dpi analysis based on linear turning point formulas is extremely good , and agrees with exact numerical results quantitatively .",
    "the lower bounds for @xmath129 and @xmath131 are found by noting that they arise at @xmath47 , since for any fixed @xmath76 , the curve for @xmath118 shifts upward as @xmath51 is reduced .",
    "the lower bound for @xmath130 ( and upper bound for @xmath131 ) follows from the fact that @xmath361 at @xmath362 .",
    "this result also stems from the fourth - order term since it only allows transitions between energy levels with @xmath365 , where @xmath283 is an integer . for spin",
    "@xmath17 the existence of the ground state tunneling requires @xmath366 , as before ."
