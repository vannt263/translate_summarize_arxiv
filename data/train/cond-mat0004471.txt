    "superconductivity is a subject that has attracted prolonged interest in the condensed matter community .",
    "much of our current understanding of this subject is based on the standard bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs)@xcite theory , which has enjoyed great success when applied to conventional superconductors .",
    "the discovery of the `` high-@xmath0 '' cuprate superconductors opened a new chapter in the study of superconductivity .",
    "it is now well understood that just like in the bcs theory , electrons in cuprate superconductors form cooper pairs .",
    "moreover , it has been established that the wave functions of these cooper pairs have predominantly @xmath1-wave symmetry .",
    "however , the origin of the force that leads to cooper pairing in these systems is not yet understood and , experimentally , significant deviations from the bcs framework ( which we take to include a fermi liquid description of the normal state ) have been found near and above the transition temperature,@xcite especially in the underdoped cuprates.@xcite theoretically , there is a continuum of proposals for understanding these anomalies which range from conceptually modest ( if practically far reaching ) enhancements of the bcs framework ( spin fluctuations,@xcite the crossover to pre - formed pairs,@xcite etc ) , to the influence of various hypothesized quantum critical points@xcite on to spin charge separation and non - fermi liquid normal states.@xcite finally there are scenarios based on self - organized dimensional reduction ( stripes ) which are very different in spirit.@xcite    this paper , also motivated by the physics of the cuprates , is firmly in the conceptually modest camp .",
    "we examine a new crossover out of the bcs corner , this time to a superconductor with long range pairing interactions , i.e. in which the range of the pairing potential @xmath2 is much longer than the coherence length ( @xmath3 ) deduced from measurements of the ( anisotropic ) gap in the quasiparticle spectrum .",
    "we remind the reader that in the bcs theory , the phonon - mediated , retarded attraction between electrons is often modeled as a short - range instantaneous attractive potential . as a matter of fact",
    ", it is often modeled as a constant attractive scattering potential in momentum ( @xmath4 ) space , which corresponds to a @xmath5-function attraction in real space.@xcite this is an excellent approximation because in conventional superconductors the coherence length @xmath6 is of order @xmath7 , while the phonon - mediated attraction is a local ( but retarded ) on - site interaction with range of order the lattice spacing , and therefore the range is effectively zero compared to the size of the cooper pairs . in such a short range model ,",
    "the elementary excitations are quasiparticles with a ( @xmath4 independent ) excitation gap @xmath8 ; the only collective mode below @xmath9 is the linear goldstone mode , whose energy is pushed up to the plasmon energy in real systems due to the existence of the long - range coulomb interaction .",
    "the classic bcs limit also involves the assumption of weak coupling @xcite whereupon thermally excited quasiparticles control the largely mean - field superconducting transition temperature @xmath0 , giving rise to a universal ratio @xmath10 .",
    "our interest in what happens when the range of the interaction is no longer the lattice spacing but instead crosses the ( suitably defined , see below ) coherence length arises from four considerations .",
    "first , @xmath6 is much shorter in the cuprates than in conventional superconductors ; in fact @xmath6 is of order five lattice spacings in the a - b plane , and less than one lattice spacing along the c - axis . therefore even if it turns out that the effective attractive interaction that gives rise to pairing is of the order of a lattice spacing , @xmath2 and @xmath6 will be comparable .",
    "second , the physics of the pseudogap regime is most simply explained by invoking a suppression of @xmath0 by fluctuations that are small in the bcs limit .",
    "quite generally the order parameter ( or pair wavefunction ) involves a relative piece and a center of mass piece , and the latter is what enters the standard ginzburg - landau theory .",
    "the simplest possibility is that the phase of the center of mass piece fluctuates strongly and this has been suggested in the context of the cuprates from two different standpoints , as the physics of strongly coupled pre - formed pairs @xcite or that of a low superfluid density coming from a doped mott state.@xcite a more novel possibility is that the relative pair wavefunction has soft fluctuations , and as we demonstrate in this paper , these arise in the limit of a long range attraction .",
    "third , it appears that the model we study here is relevant to some of the proposed mechanisms for cuprate superconductivity .",
    "the first example is the inter - layer pair hopping mechanism proposed by anderson and co - workers.@xcite in this theory , pairing is induced by coherent _",
    "pair hopping _ along the c - axis , provided that _",
    "single electron _",
    "hopping is frustrated by the non - fermi liquid nature of the normal state .",
    "it was emphasized@xcite that high @xmath0 comes from the fact that the matrix element for pair hopping is _ diagonal _ in @xmath4 space , although the symmetry of the order parameter is determined by the in - plane pairing potential .",
    "mathematically , the pair hopping term is equivalent to an attractive potential off - diagonal in layer index , even though its physical origin is _ kinetic _ energy along the c - axis ; in particular , being diagonal ( or a @xmath5-function ) in @xmath4 space , it corresponds to a pairing potential that has an _ infinite _ range in real space .",
    "a second example of this is the spin - fluctuation mechanism proposed by pines , scalapino , and co - workers.@xcite in this theory , the range of the effective pairing interaction mediated by antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations is the spin - spin correlation length ; as one reduces the doping level and approaches the antiferromagnetic instability from the overdoped side ( where the system is more bcs - like ) , the spin - spin correlation length and therefore the range of the pairing interaction increases ; it can become very large in the underdoped region , and _ diverges _ when approaching the antiferromagnetic instability .",
    "finally , given the importance of the subject of superconductivity , we feel the situation we study here ( which is opposite to the familiar short - range attraction limit ) is interesting in its own right .",
    "even if it proves not to be of particular relevance to superconductivity in cuprates , it may become relevant elsewhere.@xcite    our main results may be summarized as following .",
    "we find in addition to the usual quasiparticle excitations , the system supports collective modes whose energies are significantly lower than the quasiparticle gap @xmath8 , when @xmath11 ; in the limit that @xmath3 , the lowest energy collective mode gap becomes _ much lower _ than @xmath8 , and",
    "the number of collective modes below @xmath9 becomes large . at finite temperatures , due to the thermal fluctuations of these collective modes ,",
    "the transition temperature @xmath0 becomes significantly lower than the mean field transition temperature , @xmath12 ( which is controlled by the thermally excited quasiparticles and does not know about the collective modes ) . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the electrons are paired ( in momentum space ) but there is no long - range phase coherence ; thus the system exhibits pseudogap behavior .",
    "also the effective ginzburg - landau theory needs to be modified in this case ; in addition to the center of mass degree of freedom of the superconducting order parameter ( or cooper pairs ) , which is the only degree of freedom taken into account in the original ginsburg - landau description , we also need to take into account the fluctuations of the _ relative _ or _ internal _ degrees of freedom of the order parameter . as a consequence spatial gradients couple to the internal pair structure in non - trivial ways , and although we have not done the computation yet , we suspect that the critical field @xmath14 will be governed by a coherence length that is distinct from the one derived from the gap .    in the main part of this paper , we will take the attitude that this is an interesting model system to study , and work out various properties of such a model , especially those that are different from the short - range limit of the bcs theory .",
    "discussion of the possible relevance of our considerations to the cuprates will be reserved to the summary section .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as following . in section [ cooper ]",
    "we revisit the cooper problem , and keep the finite range of the attractive potential explicit .",
    "we note some problems involved in taking the limit of long - ranged potentials and specify the precise nature of the limit we consider in this paper .",
    "we find that in the limit @xmath15,@xcite there are a large number of bound state solutions , whose binding energies are comparable to the ground state .",
    "these bound states correspond loosely to the collective modes in the many - body problem . in section",
    "[ reduced ] we study the bcs reduced hamiltonian with a finite range attractive force , solving for both the mean - field ground state , and the zero momentum collective modes using the linearized equations of motion for the order parameter . in section [ gl ]",
    "we develop a ginzburg - landau effective theory from our model , using the functional integral method .",
    "we find that it is necessary to keep track of the fluctuations of both the internal and center of mass degrees of freedom of the superconducting order parameter ; in particular , in the limit @xmath15 , @xmath0 is controlled by the fluctuations of the internal degrees of the order parameter , and is much lower than @xmath12 . in section [ tcreduction ]",
    "we calculate the reduction of @xmath0 from @xmath12 due to the thermal fluctuations of the collective modes , using the ginzburg - landau theory developed earlier . in section [ summary ]",
    "we discuss the possible relevance of our work to the cuprate superconductors and mention some connections to other work in the literature .",
    "we begin by studying the cooper problem , in which the wave function of a cooper pair takes the form : |=_0<_k < e_cg(*k*)c^_*k * c^_-*k*|_0 , where @xmath16 is the filled fermi sea , @xmath17 is the single electron energy measured from the fermi level , and @xmath18 ( fermi energy ) is an energy cutoff . in phonon",
    "mediated attraction models , @xmath19 is usually taken to be the debye energy . in this paper",
    "we treat @xmath19 as a parameter that can be varied in our effective model .",
    "the hamiltonian ( for both the cooper problem considered here and the many - body problem in the bcs reduced hamiltonian approximation considered in the following section ) takes the form h=_*k*,_kc^_*k*c_*k * -_*k**k*v_|*k*-*k*|c^_*k * c^_-*k * c_-*k*c_*k*. [ reducedeq ] here v_q=1a is the fourier transform of an attractive potential @xmath20 ; @xmath21 is the area of the system.@xcite it is understood that the summation of the second term of eq .",
    "( [ reducedeq ] ) is restricted to states with @xmath22 . for simplicity , we assume @xmath23 and @xmath20 are positive definite , so the ground state for the cooper problem has @xmath24-wave symmetry , and the many - electron system is an @xmath24-wave superconductor",
    ". we will comment on the generalization to a d - wave superconductor in the concluding section .    the schroedinger equation that @xmath25 satisfies",
    "is eg(*k*)=2_kg(*k*)-_*k*v_|*k*-*k*| g(*k* ) .",
    "[ coopereq ] where @xmath26 is the eigenenergy . for a bound state",
    ", we must have @xmath27 .",
    "for a general @xmath23 , the integral equation ( [ coopereq ] ) is difficult to solve .",
    "cooper solved the short - range limit of this problem . in this limit",
    ", @xmath28 is a constant in momentum space , and therefore a @xmath5-function in real space .",
    "it was found that there exists only one bound state solution , with @xmath24-wave symmetry ; for weak coupling ( @xmath29 , @xmath30 being the density of states at the fermi energy ) , the energy of this state is@xcite e-2e_ce^-2/n(0)v .",
    "[ cooperen ] this well known dependence of the binding energy on @xmath31 is extremely singular . for finite but very short - range attractive potentials",
    ", there may be more bound state solutions ( probably in other angular momentum channels ) .",
    "however , due to the singular dependence of the binding energy on the pairing potential , the binding energies of these states will be much smaller than the ground state , even if the effective pairing potential only changes slowly from one channel to another .",
    "here we consider the opposite limit , in which @xmath20 has a long but finite range , @xmath2 .",
    "although the explicit form of @xmath20 is unimportant to our basic conclusions , for concreteness we assume it has a gaussian form : v(r)=v_0e^-r^2/2l^2 , and therefore v_q=2l^2av_0e^-q^2l^2/2 .",
    "we are interested in following the evolution of the system as @xmath2 is increased and in the regime where @xmath2 is large , @xmath32 .",
    "one possibility is to consider potentials of the `` kac type '' familiar from statistical mechanics , where the range is increased while keeping the integrated strength of the potential fixed , thereby achieving an unproblematic thermodynamic limit .",
    "a second possibility , perhaps more appropriate to attractive interactions generated by the system itself,@xcite is to keep the interaction of fixed magnitude ( @xmath33 ) but to restrict its operation to an increasingly narrow shell around the fermi surface .",
    "we will choose the second course here .",
    "an easy estimate shows that we need to pick the cutoff energy e_cl^-d [ ecl ] in order to keep the potential energy per particle finite .",
    "this also has the advantage that , by construction , is suppresses the tendency to phase separation that would otherwise be a complication with attractive long range interactions.@xcite there is however , a final caveat . for technical reasons , starting in the next paragraph , we will often employ a gradient expansion in momentum space .",
    "this is not quite consistent with the cutoff procedure but for the results of interest we will find that the precise value of the cutoff will enter weakly , leading us to believe that a better set of calculations will not alter our general scenario .",
    "since @xmath34 goes to zero rapidly for @xmath35 , if @xmath25 varies slowly on the scale of @xmath36 , we may perform a gradient expansion for @xmath25 in @xmath4-space , in the last term of eq .",

    "it is interesting to note that in eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) , the  kinetic energy \" term comes from the two - body interaction in the original hamiltonian , while the  potential \" term actually is the original kinetic energy term .    for large @xmath2 , the  mass \" @xmath41 is large , and we may use wkb approximation to analyze eq .",

    "@xmath42 is a constant of order 1 ; it is approximately @xmath43 for hard wall boundary conditions .",
    "we find the binding energy is essentially the depth of the attractive two - body potential @xmath33 ; this dependence is much less singular than the short - range limit defined above .",
    "also the cutoff @xmath19 does not enter explicitly.@xcite at this point we define a  coherence length \" = 2v_f/    zero temperature:@xcite @xmath44 , where @xmath45 is the quasiparticle gap at zero temperature .",
    "what we have in mind is that the binding energy in the cooper problem will be the same as twice the quasiparticle gap in the bcs problem .",
    "this is _ not _ the case in short - range models ; however , as we will see later , it is indeed true in the present case .",
    "we need to emphasize however , that @xmath6 is _ not _ the size of the cooper pair wave function @xmath46 in the two - body problem studied in this section ( this is the case even in short - range models ) ; the latter can be estimated easily from eq .",
    "( [ sch ] ) .",
    "the size of the ground state wave function in momentum space for the hamiltonian ( [ sch ] ) is k ~(1v_fm)^1/3 = ( v_0v_fl^2)^1/3 , thus @xmath47 ; it actually increases with @xmath2 ; however the sublinear dependence means for large @xmath2 we do have @xmath48 .",
    "this points to some ambiguities in what is meant by the coherence length in our problem and presumably spatial gradients may be governed by a different coherence length than the gap coherence length .",
    "we note that this possibility has been raised on completely different grounds in ref . .",
    "in order for the gradient expansion performed above to be valid , we must have @xmath49 , i.e. , @xmath25 of the ground state varying slowly over the scale @xmath36 , which is the range of @xmath23 .",
    "this leads to the condition l2v_f",
    "/ v_0 , [ condition ] as advertised earlier .",
    "it turns out that throughout this paper the gradient expansion in momentum space is the key technique that allows explicit calculations of various physical quantities to be made , and the above condition defines the range of its validity . for a given potential with fixed @xmath33 and @xmath2 , one may also interpolate between the short - range and long - range limits by varying @xmath50 . in the following",

    "\\iv ) the total number of bound states is @xmath54 .",
    "\\v ) the energy spacing between the ground state and the first excited state is @xmath55 , i.e. , it is much lower than the binding energy of the ground state itself , in contrast to the short range case .",
    "the gradient expansion does not apply to all bound states , even if @xmath15 .",
    "one can show that it only applies to states with energy measured from the ground state ( or bottom of the potential well ) @xmath56 .",
    "nevertheless the estimate of number of bound states in various channels should be qualitatively correct .",
    "these large number of low - energy bound states correspond loosely to the low - energy collective modes in the many body problem studied in the following sections , and they lead to a significant reduction of @xmath0 from its mean - field value @xmath12 ( whose scale is set by the gap which is the same as the cooper pair binding energy here , @xmath57 ) .",
    "this may be understood heuristically in the following way .",
    "when the temperature @xmath58 is reduced to @xmath12 , electrons start to form cooper pairs . in the short - range bcs model ,",
    "there is only one way to form a cooper pair , thus all pairs condense into one state immediately and long - range coherence is established . in the model studied here however , there are many different ways to form cooper pairs and their binding energies are comparable ; thus the system needs to go to much lower temperature for all the cooper pairs to condense into the ground state , hence @xmath59 . for @xmath13 ,",
    "the electrons are paired ( and therefore gapped ) , but there is no long - range superconducting coherence , and the system exhibit pseudogap behavior .",
    "in this section we study the bcs reduced hamiltonian , eq .",
    "( [ reducedeq ] ) . instead of solving the two - body problem in the above section",
    ", here we study the many - body problem . the difference between eq .",
    "( [ reducedeq ] ) and the full many - body problem is that in eq .",
    "( [ reducedeq ] ) , only pairs of electrons with opposite spin and total momentum zero scatter each other .",
    "( we return to the full problem , i.e. when the sum over the interacting momenta is constrained only by momentum conservation in the next section . )",
    "this leads to a very special property , that an unpaired electron never gets scattered , and thus the number of unpaired electron ( 0 or 1 ) for any @xmath4 and spin orientation is a conserved quantity .",
    "the ground state for this hamiltonian is in the subspace in which no such unpaired electron exists , namely the pair of single electron states @xmath60 and @xmath61 are either both occupied or both empty . in this subspace ,",
    "one may map the problem onto a quantum pseudospin problem.@xcite we introduce a pseudospin-1/2 operator for each @xmath4 : s_*k*^z&=&(c^_*k*c_*k * + c^_-*k*c_-*k*-1)/2 , + s_*k*^+&=&c^_*k*c^_-*k * , + s_*k*^-&=&c_-*k*c_*k*. in this mapping , the pseudospin is pointing up when a pair of single electron states are occupied , and down when they are empty ; pair creation / annihilation operators map onto spin - flip operators .",
    "the hamiltonian now takes the form ( up to a constant ) : h=_*k*2_*k*s_*k*^z -12_*k**k*v_|*k*-*k*| ( s_*k*^+s_*k*^-+s_*k*^+s_*k*^- ) = _ * k*2_*k*s_*k*^z -_*k**k*v_|*k*-*k*| ( s_*k*^xs_*k*^x+s_*k*^ys_*k*^y ) , i.e. , the kinetic energy maps onto a zeeman field that depends linearly on @xmath62 ( and changes sign at the fermi surface ) , which couples to the @xmath63 component of the pseudospins ; the pairing interaction maps onto a _ ferromagnetic _ coupling among the @xmath64 components of the pseudospins .    in the mean field approximation ,",
    "one replaces the ferromagnetic coupling among the @xmath64 components of the spins by an average field : h_mf=-_*k**b*_*k*^0 , where @xmath65 satisfies the self - consistency equation : _ * k*^0=-2_*k*+2_*k*v_|*k*-*k*| _ * _ k*^. [ mf ] here @xmath66 stands for the @xmath64 components of @xmath67 . in the ground state ,",
    "@xmath67 points in the direction of @xmath65 ; the elementary excitations are single pseudospin flips , which corresponds to a pair of bogliubov quasiparticles with opposite momenta and ( real ) spin.@xcite    in the short - range limit @xmath68 , the range of @xmath34 , @xmath36 , _ diverges _ in @xmath4 space .",
    "thus all the pseudospins are equally coupled , no matter how far away they are in @xmath4 space . in this limit ,",

    "[ fig : spectra ] . while there are clearly qualitative differences between the bec ( as well as phase fluctuation ) picture and the present model , they share the common spirit that @xmath0 is determined by collective modes instead of quasiparticle excitations .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that in real systems with long - range coulomb interaction , the energy of the goldstone mode is expected to be pushed up to the plasmon frequency ; the importance of this fact to the thermal fluctuations of this mode ( or classical phase fluctuations ) is still under discussion.@xcite on the other hand the coulomb interaction is not expected to significantly affect the spectra of the ( gapped ) exciton - like modes discussed here .",
    "this is due to the different nature of the goldstone mode and exciton modes : the former is a consequence of the broken gauge symmetry , and introducing the coulomb interaction ( or , more generally , the electromagnetic interaction ) converts the goldstone mechanism of broken symmetry to the higgs mechanism .",
    "the exciton modes , on the other hand , are the bound states formed by quasiparticle pairs due to the residual attractive interaction between quasiparticles not included in the mean field approximation .",
    "we therefore believe the presence of coulomb interaction does not affect the fluctuation physics discussed here significantly .",
    "as pointed out already in the introduction , in some theoretical models for cuprate superconductivity , the range of the interaction that gives rise to cooper pairing can be very long . in the interlayer pair",
    "hopping model,@xcite it is assumed that pairing is induced by a pair hopping term in the hamiltonian , that is diagonal in momentum space .",
    "fourier - transforming to real space , this corresponds to an _ infinite _ range hopping term for cooper pairs , corresponding ( loosely ) to the @xmath82 limit of the model we study here ( the fact that the hopping term is off - diagonal in layer index is of no qualitative consequence ) . in that _ specific form _ , it has already been shown@xcite that the model may be solved exactly in the absence of any other in - plane paring interaction , the transition temperature is zero , and there is pseudogap behavior at low temperatures .",
    "our results are in agreement with this observation .",
    "the model we use here , however , is more general and versatile , and in particular enables one to address how the pseudogap behavior develops as the range @xmath2 increases , and how @xmath0 approaches zero as @xmath82 .",
    "it is equally interesting to scrutinize the results obtained here in the context of the spin fluctuation theory@xcite of cuprate superconductivity . in this model",
    "the range of the interaction @xmath2 is essentially the spin - spin correlation length.@xcite thus @xmath2 is of order lattice spacing in the overdoped region of the phase diagram , increases as the doping level @xmath196 decreases , becomes much longer than the lattice spacing in the underdoped region , and eventually diverges upon approaching the antiferromagnetic phase boundary at very low doping .",
    "the pseudogap behavior is observed in the underdoped regime , where @xmath188 while the gap ( the maximum of the @xmath1-wave gap measured at very low @xmath58 by , say , photoemission ) slowly _ increases _ as @xmath196 decreases .",
    "this behavior is certainly consistent with our findings here ; the reduction of @xmath0 and its departure from the gap is due to the increase of @xmath2 , while the size of gap , which in our model saturates at the depth of the potential well @xmath33 for large @xmath2 , would be set by the scale of the near neighbor spin coupling strength @xmath197 .",
    "hence at a very crude level , we can qualitatively account for the phenomenology of the underdoped cuprates by combining our results with the spin - fluctuation model .    on the experimental side ,",
    "some circumstantial evidence for both the importance of the longer range part ( beyond near - neighbor ) of the pairing interaction , and the possible relevance of our results , exists .",
    "i ) recent photoemission measurements@xcite of gap anisotropy have found deviations from the standard _",
    "* k*k_x - k_y [ dx2y2 ] dependence of the @xmath198 order parameter in the underdoped region , with the deviation increasing with the decreasing doping level .",
    "this deviation is interpreted@xcite as due to longer - ranged pairing interaction , as a nearest - neighbor attraction leads to eq .",
    "( [ dx2y2 ] ) .",
    "we consider this to be ( somewhat indirect ) evidence that the range of the pairing interaction increases with decreasing doping level in underdoped cuprates .",
    "( ii ) it has been recently noticed@xcite that there is a strong correlation between @xmath0 and peak width of the _ normal state _",
    "spin susceptibility @xmath199 , in some cuprates . specifically , balatsky and and bourges@xcite found that in @xmath200 and @xmath201 compounds , @xmath202 , where @xmath203 is the width of @xmath204 at low @xmath110 .",
    "this lead the authors to conclude that  antiferromagnetism is likely responsible for the high @xmath0 superconducting mechanism \" .",
    "if so , one is lead to the conclusion that @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the range of the pairing interaction mediated by the _ normal state _",
    "antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations , in agreement with our eq .",
    "( [ ourtc ] ) ! however , given the facts that our model is greatly oversimplified as far",
    "as the cuprates go ( see below ) and our treatment of the fluctuation effects is still preliminary ( also below ) , we consider this agreement to be fortuitous at this point .",
    "nevertheless , the findings of ref .",
    "do indicate the importance of the range of interaction on @xmath0 , and are in qualitative agreement with our results .",
    "( iii ) experimentally , it has been found@xcite that upon cooling underdoped cuprate samples , the temperature @xmath207 at which the pseudogap opens up depends on the location in momentum space ; @xmath207 is highest near the superconducting gap maxima , while lowest near the gap nodes ; it thus suggests that @xmath207 is a  local \" property in momentum space .",
    "this can be understood quite naturally by invoking a long range pairing interaction as studied here , since such an interaction is localized in momentum space . as we have shown in section [",
    "reduced ] , one can define a momentum - dependent mean field transition temperature , @xmath208 , which increases monotonically with @xmath73 ; it also sets the temperature @xmath209 below which a local gap is opened up and the pseudogap sets in .",
    "we must emphasize that the contact between our model and the cuprate physics made above is tentative , and in its present form this model can only be viewed as an interesting toy model that gives rise to pseudogap behavior . in the following",
    "we discuss some limitations of the model as well as our treatment , and some natural directions for extensions .",
    "the ground state of our model is a fully - gapped @xmath24-wave superconductor , while the cuprates ( at least most of them ) are known to have a @xmath1-wave order parameter .",
    "the most important difference between the two is that the latter supports _ gapless _ nodal quasiparticles . it has already been suggested@xcite that the thermally excited quasiparticles may be responsible for emptying the superfluid stiffness , setting the scale of @xmath0 , and giving rise to pseudogap behavior in underdoped cuprates",
    "this important piece of physics is missing in our model . on the other hand ,",
    "as long as collective modes of the _ order parameter _ are concerned , our method can be generalized to @xmath1-wave ( or other unconventional superconductors ) fairly easily .",
    "the key feature of a long ( but finite ) range pairing interaction is its _ locality _ in momentum space , i.e. , @xmath210 is sharply peaked in @xmath4 space .",
    "this allows a gradient expansion in momentum space for the order parameter . in an @xmath24-wave superconductor , @xmath210 is sharply peaked at @xmath211 , while for a @xmath1-wave superconductor appropriate for cuprates , one would choose a @xmath210 that is sharply peaked at a wave vector @xmath168 which is at or near @xmath212 .",
    "this , however , is not going to make any qualitative difference to the analysis made in this paper . at a more detailed level ,",
    "two cases need to be distinguished from each other .",
    "( i ) there is fermi surface nesting and @xmath168 is exactly or very close to the nesting wave vector . in this case",
    "the entire fermi surface participates in pairing actively and the analysis carried out here , based on the gradient expansion of the superconducting order parameter both along and perpendicular to the fermi surface , carries through straightforwardly .",
    "( ii ) there is no fermi surface nesting , or @xmath168 is not close to the nesting wave vector . in this case only certain  hot spots \" at the fermi surfaces that are connected by @xmath168 participate in the pairing actively . in this case one can still develop a gradient expansion within the hot spots .",
    "in either case the qualitative features of our results are expected to be robust .",
    "we note that in a recent study of the spin - fermion - hot spot model,@xcite it has been conjectured that in the limit of infinite spin - spin correlation length , the transition temperature obtained from solving the eliashberg equation is only the onset of pseudogap behavior , while the real @xmath0 vanishes in that limit .",
    "this conjecture is in agreement with our results , as the spin - spin correlation length corresponds to the range of interaction @xmath2 in our model . in the present paper",
    ", we have developed a systematic way to study the physics of pseudogap behavior due to large @xmath2 , and shown _ explicitly _ that @xmath188 as @xmath82 .",
    "our analysis of the thermal fluctuations of the collective modes is based on a ginzburg - landau free energy functional , which we derive using a functional integration formalism and an expansion in power series of the magnitude of the order parameter . strictly speaking",
    "this power series expansion is valid only in the vicinity of @xmath12 , where the amplitude of the order parameter just starts to develop ; at @xmath213 , the amplitude of the order parameter is big and such an expansion is no longer appropriate .",
    "what is also missing are the contributions from the fluctuations of components of the order parameter with finite matsubara frequencies ; we neglected them on the ground that we are primary interested effects of thermal fluctuations ; however at low @xmath58 these components are important to the physics , especially if one is also interested in the quantum fluctuations of the order parameter . even with these simplifications ,",
    "the resultant free energy functional is quite complicated , and we need to introduce approximations in the one - loop calculation of @xmath0 , like neglecting the anisotropy in the internal ( relative ) space of the order parameter when the center of mass carries a finite momentum .",
    "it is quite possible that one can do a better job in analyzing the fluctuation , especially in the limit of @xmath214 .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that all our approximations tend to _ underestimate _ the effects of fluctuations , and thus our basic conclusion that @xmath215 when @xmath216 , is clearly valid .    despite the various disclaimers made above",
    ", we hope the model and the crossover introduced here will serve as a different paradigm of a non - bcs transition to a superconducting state , which can exhibit pseudogap behavior even without leaving the weak coupling regime .",
    "its relevance to cuprate physics is not completely clear at present , but there are encouraging signs that it is worth further pursuit .",
    "we have benefited greatly from discussions with and comments from dan agterberg , nick bonesteel , elbio dagotto , lev gorkov , peter littlewood , and doug scalapino .",
    "this work was supported by nsf dmr-9971541 , the fairchild and sloan foundations ( ky ) , and nsf dmr-9978074 , and the sloan and packard foundations ( sls ) .                            in strong - coupling superconductors ,",
    "the frequency dependence of the order parameter may need to be taken into account in the ginsburg - landau description .",

    "since our study is motivated by the cuprate superconductors which are layered compounds , throughout the paper we mostly assume that we are dealing with a 2d system .",
    "however in our analysis of the fluctuations in section [ tcreduction ] we will invoke the quasi two - dimensional nature of the system to regulate the `` mermin - wagner '' infrared singularities by introducing an infrared cutoff on the 2d momenta .    indeed , in the continuum the system would , generically , be unstable to collapse if the bare interactions are attractive ( a point emphasized in the context of the cuprates by v. j. emery , s. a. kivelson and h. q. lin , phys .",
    "64 , 475 ( 1990 ) ) so even our first possibility would rely on the notion that we are studying an effective interaction , or perhaps invoking an underlying lattice to regulate the potential energy .",

    "b * 54 * , r768 ( 1996 ) .          if the interactions between electrons with same spin are kept , one needs to introduce two more sets of hubbard - stratonovich fields ( see later ) , one for up - spin pairs and one for down - spin pairs , to decouple these interactions .",
    "this will add some more technical complexity to the analysis , but does not change the essential physics .",
    "e.g. _ , section 5.3 of p. m. chaikin and t. c. lubensky , _ principles of condensed matter physics _ , cambridge university press , cambridge ( 1995 ) . in field theory language this is a self - consistent one - loop calculation .",
    "it is clear that a more appropriate boundary condition is to require the modes to vanish at the boundaries .",
    "however the periodic boundary condition has the advantage that the mode amplitude is a constant inside the well , thus @xmath177 is also a constant inside the well , consistent with our assumption .",
    "this is the only place the cutoff @xmath19 explicitly enters a physical quantity ( through @xmath218 ) , @xmath0 , in this paper .",
    "however the dependence is so weak ( logarithmic ) , that the dependence of @xmath19 on @xmath2 hardly affects anything .",
    "a longer range pairing interaction can give rise to other interesting physical effects not discussed in this paper .",
    "for example , it has been argued recently ( h. ghosh , phys .",
