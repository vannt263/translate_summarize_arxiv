    "<S> we find that asymmetric scattering strongly enhances the effect and discuss its dependence on temperature and fermi energy .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction_. recent advances in heat measurements have enabled to envisage promising thermoelectric applications at the mesoscale . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite in particular , there have been a number of exciting proposals ranging from thermal analogs of electronic rectifiers @xcite and transistors @xcite to efficient converters of heat into electricity @xcite which can be shown to reach optimized configurations . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite of fundamental importance is the experimental verification of the carriers charge sign using thermopower techniques only . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    since these novel devices operate at the quantum regime of transport , it is of primary interest to investigate dephasing effects which may be detrimental to their performance . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , energy flow at finite temperature is expected to be particularly sensitive to inelastic transitions inside the sample due , e.g. , to coupling to phonons . </S>",
    "<S> this problem has been addressed only very recently . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    a convenient way to introduce dephasing and energy relaxation in a mesoscopic conductor is based on the voltage probe model . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a fictitious terminal is attached to the sample such that the net current flowing through the probe is set to zero . </S>",
    "<S> hence , a carrier absorbed by the probe is reemitted into the conductor with an unrelated phase . </S>",
    "<S> the clear advantage of this approach lies on its simplicity and its independence of the microscopic details of the phase - randomizing processes . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , universal properties of generic conductors can be investigated this way . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the model has been recently applied to find the temperature and chemical potential profiles of an array of quantum dots . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite    including a third terminal acting as a dephasing probe requires to extend the scattering approach to the multiterminal case . for thermoelectric transport , </S>",
    "<S> this was achieved by butcher . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite experimentally , there are already available data for paradigmatic mesoscopic systems such as two - terminal point contacts @xcite and chaotic cavities . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the multiterminal case , however , has been less explored . </S>",
    "<S> a very recent exception is ref . where a voltage drop is generated transversally to a horizontal thermal gradient in a four - terminal setup with an asymmetric scatterer .    </S>",

    "<S> quite generally , we find that @xmath0 decreases as compared to the case without probe and , strikingly , the presence of incoherent scattering due to the probe causes the development of a magnetic - field asymmetry in @xmath0 . to illustrate our findings , </S>",

    "<S> , we explicitly calculate the size of the magnetoasymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> this result is relevant in view of recent predictions that relate this asymmetry to efficiency limits of thermal devices in converting a temperature gradient into electrical work . </S>",

    "<S> the transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the transmission probability @xmath16 : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the conductance quantum , @xmath19 the number of propagating channels in lead @xmath12 and @xmath20 the energy derivative of the fermi distribution function evaluated at @xmath21 . in eq .   </S>",

    "<S> , @xmath39 above ) . </S>",
    "<S> the second part is more surprising  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite    _ adiabatic case_. more interesting is the case when the probe plays simultaneously the role of an ideal potentiometer _ and _ thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> then , not only the charge current but also the energy flux is zero at the probe . </S>",
    "<S> these two conditions determine @xmath22 and @xmath41 . </S>",

    "<S> we define the functions @xmath61 and @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are lead indices and @xmath64 is the total number of modes . </S>",

    "<S> we derive the useful relations , @xmath65    from eq .   </S>",
    "<S> we immediately see that the mean vanishes , @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this result was found in ref .   for the case without dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> the reason is clear : the @xmath67 coefficients are functions of the energy derivative of the scattering matrix , but this is zero on average ( the derivative can be positive or negative for a specific sample of the ensemble but fluctuates on average around zero ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations are described by @xmath68 , which are generally nonzero . </S>",
    "<S> for definiteness , we set @xmath69 . then , the thermopower fluctuations for both the isothermal and adiabatic cases are governed by the _ </S>",
    "<S> same _ expression : @xmath70 our result generalizes the thermopower fluctuations to the case of finite dephasing . </S>",
    "<S> note that the fluctuations are not universal and vanish quickly as the mode number increases . </S>",
    "<S> strikingly , the same functional dependence ( @xmath71 ) appears in the magnetoasymmetry of the weakly nonlinear conductance @xcite since it also depends on the energy derivative of the transmission . </S>",
    "<S> the fluctuations are twice larger in the absence of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> importantly , incoherent scattering effects reduce drastically the fluctuations of @xmath0 since these have a quantum origin and the probe introduces decoherence in the system . to leading order , one has @xmath72 .    in the adiabatic case , we have neglected in @xmath0 terms that do not contribute to the variance ( e.g. , terms that involve three @xmath67 s are of higher order ) . </S>",
    "<S> then , eq .   can be approximated as , @xmath73 \\,.\\ ] ] since for symmetric couplings ( @xmath69 ) the prefactors of @xmath74 in eq . </S>",
    "<S> are , on the ensemble average , equal to those of the isothermal case [ eq .  ] </S>",

    "<S> this can be seen by recasting @xmath39 as @xmath79 , which is manifestly symmetric under @xmath77 reversal . </S>",

    "<S> are a _ higher - order _ effect . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the size of @xmath85 will decrease quickly as temperature decreases ( typically , as @xmath86 ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the leading - order sommerfeld approximation neglects terms of order @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite this factor is rather small in macroscopic metals and it is thus not necessary to consider higher orders . </S>",
    "<S> but in low dimensional systems the @xmath77-asymmetry of @xmath0 should be visible since @xmath10 and @xmath15 can be of the same order . </S>",

    "<S> _ numerical simulations_. clearly , for a chaotic cavity the thermopower magnetoasymmetry vanishes on average . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , we expect the fluctuations to be exceedingly small since @xmath85 depends , to leading order in @xmath15 , on the _ second _ derivative of the transmission . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite the asymmetric scatterer deflects the electronic trajectories differently depending on the @xmath77 direction . </S>",

    "<S> conclusions_. to summarize , we have investigated incoherent scattering effects on the thermoelectric transport of a mesoscopic conductor using a fictitious probe acting as an ideal potentiometer and thermometer . </S>",
    "<S> our main findings are : ( i ) a general expression for the quantum fluctuations of the seebeck coefficient upon elimination of the probe valid for both isothermal and adiabatic probes ; ( ii ) a magnetic - field asymmetry of the thermopower , requiring both inelastic and dephasing processes , which becomes apparent only when higher - order terms are considered in a sommerfeld expansion . </S>",
