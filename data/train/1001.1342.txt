    "disordered systems represent one of the most important fields of statistical mechanics .",
    "disorder is at the base of many interesting phenomena whose understanding is often far from being trivial or immediate .",
    "its use varies from applications in condensed matter physics to computer science and , more recently , to the broad range of natural , artificial , and social networks .",
    "one of the most important analytical tool to study disordered systems is represented by suitable mean - field theories . originally developed to understand spin glass models , the replica method ( rm ) and the cavity method ( cm ) are nowadays largely used in many other fields of statistical physics and computer science and represent the most powerful analytical methods to investigate the intricate nature of the spin glass and other disordered phases @xcite .    among disordered models",
    "whose dimensionality - in a broad sense - can be considered infinite @xcite , one can single out a `` hierarchical '' family of models of increasing difficulty such as : fully connected models ( corresponding to infinite connectivity in the thermodynamic limit ) like the sherrington - kirkpatrick model @xcite , finite connectivity models like the viana - bray model @xcite , and models defined over small - world networks @xcite .",
    "this latter class of models has been introduced in recent years and represents an important development in modeling more realistic situations in which the spins , besides interacting through a random finite connectivity , distributed according to some given distribution with average degree @xmath2 , interact also through short - range connections . in other words , small - world models constitute an interplay between purely random and regular finite - dimensional models . it is known that , despite the underlying finite dimensionality @xmath0 present in these kind of graphs , in the thermodynamic limit , models defined on them manifest a mean field behavior .",
    "this fact , far from being trivial , to be rigorously proved , may lead to hope that the rm or the cm could be used to solve small - world models .",
    "indeed such methods have been already successfully exploited in @xcite for @xmath3 small - world models defined upon adding a poisson distributed random connectivity @xmath2 to the underlying regular one - dimensional chain . however , if we take a look at the mathematical structure of these methods we recognize the following . for what concerns the rm",
    ", we need to know analytically the two leading eigenvectors of the transfer matrix of the ising model without the shortcuts but immersed in a random external field ; whereas for what concerns the cm , it is essential that the underlying graph @xmath4 had a tree - like structure , _ i.e. _ , no loops , at least in the thermodynamic limit . as a consequence ,",
    "both methods seem hardly applicable to small - world models if @xmath5 .",
    "the effective field theory we have recently developed in @xcite , based on mapping a generic random model onto a non random one ( the `` pure model '' ) @xcite is instead applicable to these models .",
    "in fact , though this theory is able to give exact answers only in the paramagnetic ( p ) regions , there is no limitation in the underlying dimension @xmath0 .",
    "whereas the theory can be fully treated analytically for @xmath6 , for @xmath5 , we can still apply it semi - analytically  ; see @xcite . ] .",
    "all we need to apply the theory is to solve - analytically or numerically - the pure model in @xmath0 dimension in the absence of the random shortcuts and in the presence of a uniform external field .",
    "the values of a certain observable @xmath7 so obtained _ una tantum _ will be then used to get the corresponding value @xmath8 for the model in the presence of the shortcuts and for any choice of the disorder parameters ( couplings and connectivity ) .",
    "this feature , together with the fact that the effective field equations of the theory have a very simple structure and a more immediate physical interpretation compared to the equations of the rm method ( in which the introduction of several coupled auxiliary fields is necessary ) , makes this effective field theory particularly interesting to all those applications in which @xmath5 or else the number of parameters of the model is high .",
    "of course one has to pay such an advantage with the impossibility to get exact results out of the p region .",
    "however , as we shall show in this paper , also in the other regions of the phase diagram the theory succeeds in giving effective approximations allowing us to obtain important insights on the frozen states , even if we do not have a direct access to them , as instead the rm or the cm could do , if they were applicable also to models with loops .    in this paper",
    "we consider random ising models defined over small - world networks having an underlying regular lattice @xmath4 of dimension @xmath9 . given the initial lattice @xmath4 with @xmath10 sites , we build the small - world network by adding @xmath11 links uniformly spread over @xmath4 .",
    "this implies that at each site , besides the @xmath12 neighbors , there are additional long - range neighbors whose number is distributed according to a poisson distribution with average @xmath2 .",
    "interactions act via a coupling @xmath13 for the @xmath12 short - range neighbors and via a further coupling @xmath14 for the other long - range neighbors .",
    "this way of building a small - world network is different from the re - wiring method of watts and strogatz@xcite ( in which the number of shortcuts per site is also poissonian distributed ) and it is more convenient for analytical calculations .",
    "however , just by using the effective field theory at the base of this paper , it is possible to deal with the similar re - wiring small - world models as well , and to show rigorously that the critical behavior of the two kind of models is identical @xcite .    by using monte carlo ( mc ) simulations we check the predictions of the effective field theory for the critical surfaces , the susceptibility , the average magnetization and the two point connected correlation function as a function of the euclidean distance @xmath15 defined on @xmath4 . the ferromagnetic ising model ( both @xmath14 and @xmath13 positive ) on small - world networks has been extensively studied @xcite .",
    "however , of remarkable interest , for both its theoretical and practical implications , is the case with negative short - range antiferromagnetic coupling , @xmath16 . the anti - ferromagnetic ising model on small world networks",
    "was studied in @xcite for the case where there is only one antiferromagnetic coupling constant ( @xmath17 ) , but , apart from the fully connected case @xcite , no attention has been paid to the fact that , in the more general situation , may exist multicritical points with first- and second - order phase transition .",
    "in fact , when @xmath16 and @xmath18 , the effective field theory predicts two critical temperatures with first or second - order phase transitions separating two p regions . in this case ,",
    "simulation results show large fluctuations and a rather slow approach to the thermodynamic limit , confirming the slow dynamics of the frustrated system and the importance to have analytical or semi - analytical frustrated - free tools to investigate these models .",
    "quite interestingly , the model with given couplings @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and slightly different values of the connectivity @xmath2 , can show drastically different phase diagrams either showing two ferromagnetic ( f ) phase transitions or a single spin - glass ( sg ) phase transition . in the case of first - order phase transitions the magnetization discontinuity is not exactly predicted by the theory but simulation results show clearly the signature of a discontinuity for both the f and sg order parameters in correspondence of the theoretical p - sg critical temperature .",
    "furthermore , we see good agreement of the susceptibility predictions in the p phase .",
    "we also consider a two - dimensional modified edwards - anderson model@xcite with added long - range shortcuts .",
    "this is a special case where besides the connectivity disorder there is also disorder on the value of the short - range coupling . as predicted by the theory",
    ", simulations confirm that any infinitesimal addition of shortcuts leads the system to have a finite temperature p - sg phase transition which coincides with the theoretical one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in secs .",
    "ii and iii we recall the definition of the small - world models and the method , which mainly consists in finding the solution of the self - consistent equation ( [ theoa ] ) and minimizing the effective free energy ( [ theoll ] ) . in sec .",
    "iv we report our mc simulations for several interesting cases selected for comparison with the theoretical predictions . finally , in sec .",
    "v some conclusions are drawn .",
    "we consider random ising models constructed by super - imposing random graphs with finite average connectivity onto some given lattice @xmath4 whose set of bonds @xmath19 and dimension will be indicated by @xmath20 and @xmath0 , respectively .",

    "this choice leads in the thermodynamic limit @xmath53 to a number of long range connections per site distributed according to a poisson law with mean connectivity @xmath2 .    in this paper for the @xmath49 s we will assume the distribution @xmath54 for the short - range nearest - neighbor coupling , @xmath13 we will consider the distribution , @xmath55 except in the last case studied , the modified edwards - anderson model , where we consider , @xmath56",
    "depending on the temperature t , and on the parameters of the probability distributions , @xmath57 and @xmath58 , the random model may stably stay either in the paramagnetic ( p ) , in the ferromagnetic ( f ) , or in the spin glass ( sg ) phase . in our approach for the f and sg phases",

    "similarly , for any correlation function , quadratic or not , there are two natural quantities indicated by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and that in turn will be calculated in terms of @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .",
    "to avoid confusion , it should be kept in mind that in our approach , for any observable @xmath63 there are - in principle - always two solutions that we label as f and sg , but , for any temperature , only one of the two solutions is stable and useful in the thermodynamic limit .    in the following , we will use the label @xmath64 to specify that we are referring to the pure model with hamiltonian ( [ h0 ] ) .",
