    "the yang  mills gradient flow or the wilson flow  @xcite has attracted much attention in recent years in the context of lattice gauge theory .",

    "even its application to supersymmetric theory  @xcite and to the operator product expansion  @xcite is considered .",
    "reference  @xcite is a review of this notion and further related works can be found in a review  @xcite and in a most recent paper on the non - perturbative beta function  @xcite .    a crucial property of the yang ",
    "mills gradient flow , underlying the above applications , is its `` ultraviolet ( uv ) finiteness ''  @xcite . the gradient flow is a one - parameter ( called the flow - time ) evolution of the gauge field , according to a `` heat diffusion equation '' ( called the flow equation ) . a remarkable fact that can be rigorously proven  @xcite in all orders of perturbation theory",
    "is that any correlation function of the evolved ( or flowed ) gauge field becomes uv finite _ without _ the wave function renormalization , as long as the parameters of the theory are properly renormalized .",
    "moreover , _ any _ local product of the flowed gauge field remains uv finite without further ( multiplicative as well as subtractive ) renormalization .",
    "this remarkable property of the gradient flow facilitates , in particular , the construction of renormalized composite operators of the gauge field .",
    "that is , any simple product of the flowed ( bare ) gauge field as it stands is a renormalized ( i.e. , uv - finite ) quantity .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , as possible application of the gradient flow , one of us ( h.s . ) considered the construction of the energy ",
    "momentum tensor in lattice gauge theory .",
    "this application of the gradient flow to the energy ",
    "momentum tensor was further developed from a somewhat different perspective in  ref .",
    "the construction was then generalized to gauge theories including the fermion field  @xcite . the genuine energy ",
    "momentum tensor can not be defined on the lattice because the lattice structure breaks the translational invariance explicitly .",
    "even the construction of a lattice operator that reduces to the correctly normalized conserved energy ",
    "momentum tensor in the continuum limit is quite non - trivial as investigated in  refs .",
    "reference  @xcite is a pioneering work on this issue .",
    "the basic idea of  refs .",
    "@xcite , which uses the uv finiteness of the gradient flow in an essential way , is recapitulated in  sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] of the present paper .",
    "the aim of  refs .",
    "@xcite is to construct a lattice operator that automatically reduces to the correctly normalized conserved energy ",
    "momentum tensor in the continuum limit .",
    "theoretically , there is only little room for doubt on the reasoning in  refs .",
    "practically , however , it is not a priori clear whether presently available lattice parameters are sufficient to extract physical information by using the construction . on this issue , the promising result in  ref .",
    "@xcite for thermodynamical quantities in quenched qcd is quite encouraging .",
    "still , it is indispensable to numerically demonstrate the conservation law of the energy ",

    ", it seems useful to study a simpler system that would allow a similar construction of the lattice energy ",
    "momentum tensor using the gradient flow .",
    "one of the basic assumptions in  refs .",
    "@xcite is that the theory is asymptotically free .",
    "not so many field theories exhibit asymptotic freedom , however .",
    "this was our original motivation for the present study on the gradient flow in the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model  @xcite .",
    "it is well known  @xcite that the physics of this systems possesses many similarities with the 4d non - abelian gauge theory .",
    "these include asymptotic freedom , dynamical generation of the mass gap , and , for  @xmath3 , the topological term and associated @xmath4-parameter .",
    "see also refs .",
    "this system is also advantageous from a computational perspective ( and thus from our original motivation ) , because there exists a very efficient cluster simulation algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the state of the art in non - perturbative lattice study of the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model can be found in  ref .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper",
    ", we will show that there exists another surprising similarity between the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model and the 4d gauge theory : any correlation function of the flowed @xmath1-vector field in the former becomes uv finite _ without _ the wave function renormalization , as long as the parameters of the theory are renormalized .",
    "this uv finiteness also persists for _ any _ local product of the flowed @xmath1-vector field .",
    "this similarity is surprising , because the uv finiteness of the flowed gauge field is a non - trivial consequence  @xcite of the gauge brs symmetry that acts _ non - linearly _ on the gauge field .",
    "in fact , matter fields such as the fermion field transform linearly under the gauge brs symmetry and they _ do _ require wave function renormalisation even after the flow  @xcite . in the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model , however , it is not clear at first glance what plays the same role as this gauge brs symmetry in the 4d gauge theory .",
    "our proof clarifies this point . on the other hand , happily , because of the uv finiteness of the gradient flow in the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model , we can repeat the construction of the lattice energy ",

    "the following describes the organization of the present paper and gives a summary of the contents of each section .    in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we introduce the flow equation in the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model . if one considers the application in lattice numerical simulations , this is the equation that should be solved numerically in conjunction with the conventional monte carlo simulations .",
    "we then formulate the perturbative expansion for the system defined by the combination of the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model and the flow equation ( the flowed system ) .    in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , on the basis of the perturbative expansion developed in  sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we explicitly compute the two - point function of the flowed bare @xmath1-vector field to the one - loop order .",
    "this explicit calculation shows that the two - point function is made uv finite by the conventional parameter renormalization in the non - linear sigma model  @xcite , but without the wave function renormalization .",
    "we carry out the computation in dimensional regularization and in lattice regularization and arrive at the same conclusion .",
    "although this computation is only in the one - loop level , it strongly indicates that the gradient flow in the non - linear sigma model has a similar uv property as the gauge theory .    as the proof for the 4d gauge theory in  ref .",
    "@xcite and the renormalizability proof in the stochastic quantization  @xcite , our proof in all orders of perturbation theory uses a local field theory with one spacetime dimension higher : we use a @xmath2-dimensional field theoretical representation of the flowed system . in  sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we define this @xmath2-dimensional local field theory . then we show that the system defined through the flow equation in  sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] and the @xmath2-dimensional field theory have equivalent perturbative expansions .",
    "it is easy to see the rough equivalence .",
    "however , a closer look reveals that there are discrepancies between the two systems ; the measure term in the former is missing in the latter , while the former does not have the flow - line loop diagrams of the latter . presumably , the step to show that these two apparently different elements are actually equivalent ( sect .",
    "[ sec:4.4 ] ) is the hardest part in our argument .",
    "we will find that , to address this very subtle problem in a convincing manner , it is necessary to first discretize the flow - time derivative and then take the continuum limit for this discretization ; this necessity of discretization is also counterintuitive .",
    "once having obtained a local field theory that is ( perturbatively ) equivalent to the flowed system , a possible way to proceed is to write down a ward  takahashi relation or a zinn - justin equation  @xcite ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) for the 1pi generating functional , which restricts the possible form of counterterms , on the basis of a certain symmetry in the @xmath2-dimensional system .",
    "this is the content of  sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] . here",
    ", we encounter another surprise : the @xmath2-dimensional field theory possesses _ local _ gauge symmetries , although it does not contain any gauge field .",
    "note that the unique internal symmetry in the original 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model is the global @xmath0 symmetry .",
    "because of these gauge symmetries , we have to fix the gauge . even under the gauge fixing , there still remains a residual symmetry that acts _ non - linearly _ on various fields .",
    "we will find that the zinn - justin equation associated with this non - linear symmetry does the job .",
    "then , by listing possible counterterms ( by borrowing the information obtained in  sect .  [ sec:4.4 ] ) and examining the restriction implied by the zinn - justin equation",
    ", we finally show that the only counterterms required are those of the original 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model .",
    "in particular , the flowed @xmath1-vector field ( and its composite operators ) is not renormalized .",
    "this completes our proof for the uv finiteness of the gradient flow .    in  sect .",
    "[ sec:6 ] , on the basis of the uv finiteness established in  sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] , we construct the energy  momentum tensor in a lattice formulation of the non - linear sigma model , following the line of reasoning of  refs .  @xcite .    in summary",
    ", we have found another example in which the gradient flow exhibits a remarkable uv finiteness : in the 2d @xmath0 non - linear sigma model , any correlation function of the flowed @xmath1-vector field and its composite operators is uv finite without multiplicative ( as well as subtractive ) renormalization .",
    "our proof in the present paper also clarifies subtle but very interesting technical issues arising in the theoretical analysis of the gradient flow , such as the necessity of the discretization of the flow - time derivative and the emergence of gauge and/or non - linear symmetries in the corresponding local field theory with one dimension higher .",
    "the knowledge obtained here will be useful in considering the application of the gradient flow to a wider range of systems .    also ,",
