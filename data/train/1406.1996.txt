    "the study of the properties of liquids confined at the nanometer scale is a topic of high interest for its technological , experimental and theoretical implications .",

    "structural , thermodynamical and dynamical properties of a liquid can change near an interface ( solid , liquid , etc . )",
    "@xcite . when the surface - to - volume ratio is large , at least along one direction as for the slit pore geometry , the effect of the confining surfaces has to be taken into account .",
    "experiments and simulations on nanoconfined fluids show that molecules arrange in layers parallel to the surface .",
    "the effect becomes stronger for decreasing temperature or increasing density , until the fluid eventually solidifies .",
    "the nature of the solid , as an amorphous or a crystal , can depend on the interparticle potential and the confinement conditions @xcite . in different cases",
    "the role of the interfaces can results in complex behaviors , e.g. a persisting fluid mono - layer around a spherical impurity while the rest of the system is in a polycrystal or glassy state @xcite , or persisting amorphous water mono - layer near an hidrophilic disordered surface @xcite . in a recent experiment @xcite , kaya and",
    "coworkers found that a thin - film water on a @xmath0 surface remains in a high density liquid form for temperatures ranging from ambient ( 300k ) to supercooled ( 259k ) .",
    "the result is unexpected because , based on thermodynamics arguments @xcite , kaya and coworker would expect that the templating effect of @xmath0 on the structure of the water film should promote the tetrahedral structure of the low - density liquid .",
    "moreover , the presence of an interface can promote the heterogeneous nucleation of the crystal .",
    "however , recent experiments and simulations based on crystallographic analysis of liquids on crystals @xcite , or on colloidal self - assembly @xcite , show that the traditional theories need to be revised in these cases .",
    "confined fluids , under suitable conditions of density and temperature , can spontaneously develop patterns , e.g. stripes , and different mesophases or more complex structures @xcite .",
    "the confinement affects also the dynamics of the liquid .",
    "it has been found that near an interface there is a reduction of the local diffusivity of the liquid @xcite .",
    "computer simulations can help in interpreting the experimental results for nanoconfined fluids that are difficult to understand @xcite .",
    "different numerical approaches based on first principles simulations can give detailed informations , but are limited by their high computational cost .",
    "classical molecular dynamics of empirical fluid models employ parameters tested for the bulk case that not necessarily hold in confinement .",
    "the difficulty to adopt these bulk fluid models to the case of confinement leads to a variety of simulation results concerning the aggregation state of the fluid near the surfaces that in principle are model - dependent .",
    "it is , therefore , useful to develop coarse - grained models that allow for analytic calculations @xcite and more efficient simulations @xcite , like isotropic pairwise core - softened potentials , and that could allow us to better understand common features of fluids under confinement and the basic mechanisms of complex phenomena emerging in these systems , like pattern formation , e.g. stripes and different mesophases .",
    "this has been confirmed in a recent work @xcite in which the authors claim that the origin of quasi - crystals could be understood in the context of a coarse - grained model by the competing effect of the hard and soft core radius of interacting particles .",
    "here we focus on the study of nanoconfined anomalous fluids , relevant for biological and technological applications @xcite , by means of molecular dynamics simulations of a system of identical particles interacting through the continuous shouldered well potential ( csw ) , an isotropic pairwise core - softened potential with a repulsive shoulder and an attractive well @xcite . the csw fluid",
    "is confined in a slit pore obtained by a solvophilic structured wall , and a solvophobic wall with no structure , as described in sec.[sec : simulations ] .",
    "the csw model is suitable for studying globular proteins in solution @xcite , specific colloids @xcite , and liquid metals @xcite , and displays water - like anomalies @xcite .",
    "in particular the csw reproduces density , diffusion and structure anomalies following the water hierarchy @xcite and displays a liquid - gas and a liquid - liquid ( ll ) phase transition , both ending in critical points @xcite .",
    "here we focus on structural and dynamical properties of the csw model in confinement and show the role that the characteristic length scales of the inter - particle potential have in the structuring of the fluid .",
    "we consider a system of @xmath1 identical particles interacting by means of the csw potential confined between two parallel walls .",
    "the csw potential is defined as @xcite @xmath2+\\left(\\dfrac{a}{r}\\right)^{24}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the diameter of the particles , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the distance of the attractive minimum and the repulsive radius , respectively , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the energies of the attractive well and the repulsive shoulder , respectively , @xmath8 is the variance of the gaussian centered in @xmath4 and @xmath9 is the parameter which controls the slope between the shoulder and the well at @xmath5 .",

    ", the philic wall contributes with a positive term @xmath86 from @xmath87 to @xmath88 and with a negative term from @xmath88 to @xmath89 , due to the interaction force between the particles of the fluid and those of the philic wall .",

    "as pointed out in the introduction ( sec.[sec : introduction ] ) , the confinement can modify the structure of a fluid resulting in an inhomogeneous density profile . in a slit pore geometry , near the confining walls , particles form layers parallel to the walls as the temperature",
    "is decreased or the density is increased , as shown by our calculations for the density profile @xmath101 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : density ] ) .    to establish the aggregation state for each layer ,",
    "we compute , layer by layer , the lateral radial distribution function @xmath102 ; the 2d voronoi tessellation of each layer ; the mean square displacement ( msd ) and the survival probability ( sp ) of molecules in each layer .",
    "all these quantities together , as we discusse in the following , allow us to identify the presence and coesistence of the solid , heterogeneous fluid and homogeneous fluid .",
    "our analysis shows that the system organizes forming layers parallel to the solvophilic wall at any temperature @xmath18 and average density @xmath53 . at high @xmath18 and low @xmath53",
    "we find only one well defined layer and no layering near the solvophobic wall , while the whole system is in the fluid state . by decreasing @xmath18 and increasing @xmath53 , the number of layers increases up to eleven .",
    "furthermore , at higher value of @xmath53 , the layers appear also near the solvophobic wall .",
    "however , for high enough @xmath18 and @xmath53 we observe that away from the walls the system is in the fluid state .",
    "nonetheless , the walls affect the density profile , changing system density and aggregation state , over an extension that in our case can be up to @xmath103 layers that depends on temperature and average density of the system .",
    "the in - layer radial distribution function @xmath104 for the @xmath105-th layer ( with @xmath106 ) is computed as @xmath107\\ ] ] where @xmath108 and @xmath109 are the density of particles and the z - coordinate of the layer @xmath105 , respectively , @xmath110 is the transverse distance between two particles in the same layer ( and in internal units is @xmath111 ) . the heaviside step functions , @xmath69 , select couple of particles that lie in the layer @xmath105 of width @xmath112 .",
    "the @xmath104 is proportional to the probability of finding a molecule in the layer @xmath105 at a distance @xmath113 from a randomly chosen molecule of the same layer @xmath105 .",
    "the definition of the layer @xmath105 in which lies a particle @xmath67 is once for all established according to the value of the z - coordinate of the particle @xmath67 as : for the first layer @xmath114 , with @xmath115 , and @xmath116 for the others .",
    "this is a natural choice because particles at low temperatures or high densities tend to stratify in layers whose interdistance is approximately equal to @xmath117 .    at low density ( @xmath118 , fig.[fig : gr_rho011 ] )",
    ", we observe that the system is in a fluid state for high temperature ( @xmath119 ) in any layer .",
    "the @xmath104 of the layer @xmath120 shows a first peak around the shoulder radius ( @xmath121 ) and a second peak around the attractive well radius ( @xmath122 ) , while for the other layers only the second peak is present .",
    "we interpret this difference between the first and the other layers as the consequence of a `` templating '' effect of the solvophilic wall that at high @xmath123 is observed only on the first layer .    at @xmath124",
    "the system shows the same behavior observed for higher temperatures , except that the layer near the solvophilic wall develops patterns .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of what has been observed in monolayers with an interparticle potential composed by a hard core and a soft repulsive shoulder @xcite .    at @xmath125",
    "the layer near the solvophilic wall is still showing patterns , while the layer @xmath126 is forming crystal patches .",
    "this is evident from the analysis of the @xmath127 that goes to zero for @xmath128 and @xmath129 at @xmath125 , consistent with an incipient triangular crystal with lattice step given by the interaction potential attractive distance @xmath130 .",
    "the other layers are in a fluid state .    at @xmath131",
    "the first layer is forming a hexagonal crystal .",
    "although the hexagonal crystal in @xmath120 does not overlap exactly with the triangular wall structure , the comparison of the @xmath132 and @xmath133 of the wall shows a strong correlation between the two structures , suggesting a `` templating '' effect .",
    "this effect due to the attraction to the solvophilic wall is so strong at @xmath131 that is forcing particles to be at their repulsive distance .",
    "the high - energy cost of the resulting honeycomb lattice forming in the layer @xmath120 is compensated by the large number of attractive interactions between the particles at @xmath120 and those of the wall ( @xmath134 ) from one hand , and between the particles themeselves at @xmath120 from the other hand .",
    "this free energy minimization process is analyzed in sec.[sec : structural ] in the discreet potential approximation to understand the stripe phase formation .",
    "the triangular structure that was incipient for @xmath126 at high @xmath123 , for @xmath131 is well defined for @xmath126 and @xmath135 , with defects in the layer @xmath135 .",
    "this triangular structure is the dual lattice of the @xmath120 hexagonal layer and its formation is the consequence of a `` molding '' effect of the layer @xmath120 onto the layer @xmath126 .",
    "note that while the wall ( @xmath134 ) layer has a templating effect on the @xmath120 layer , the @xmath120 layer has a molding effect on the @xmath126 layer .",
    "the difference between the two cases is due to the smaller density of the @xmath120 layer with respect to that of the wall .",
    "the smaller density does not allow to compensate the high energy cost of the propagation of the hexagonal crystal to the layer @xmath126 .",
    "on the other hand , the triangular crystal of the @xmath126 layer is energetically favorable , because the particles are all at the attractive distance , and at this temperature can propagate to the @xmath135 layer again with a `` templating '' effect . the layer @xmath136 is made of a few triangular crystallites immersed in the fluid , while the other layers are in a fluid state .    at @xmath137",
    "both the templating and the molding effect are stronger .",
    "in particular the template of the @xmath126 layer propagates over all the six layers that are formed at this density and temperature .    at intermediate density ( @xmath138 , fig.[fig : gr_rho022 ] ) ,",
    "for @xmath119 and @xmath124 we observe the same qualitative behavior as for the low density case .",
    "for @xmath125 the layer @xmath120 has less tendency to form patterns respect to the low density case , and the layer @xmath126 to order in a crystal structure .",
    "therefore , the confined system is more fluid at this density than at lower density .",
    "we understand this result as a consequence of the larger hydration at higer density .    at @xmath131 the first layer",
    "has partially crystallized in the hexagonal and partially in the triangular structure following the template of the wall .",
    "therefore , the templating effect is now stronger then the corresponding case at lower density .",
    "the hexagonal crystal shows now a preferred direction of symmetry .",
    "this direction propagates to the layer @xmath126 , where we observe stripes along the preferred direction .",
    "the stripes propagate up to @xmath136 layer , while the other layers are in a fluid state .",
    "the peak of @xmath104 at @xmath139 ( that corresponds to the average second nearest neighbor distance ) is a signature of the stripe phase formation .    at @xmath137 the preferred direction in the deformation of the hexagonal crystal for @xmath120",
    "is more evident and we observe a clear stripe phase for the layers from @xmath126 to @xmath136 , with a peak of @xmath104 at @xmath139 more pronounced than the case at @xmath131 . the other layers form a triangular crystal at the attractive distance .    at high density ( @xmath140 , fig.[fig : gr_rho030 ] ) , for @xmath119 we observe the same qualitative behavior as for the lower density cases . at @xmath124",
    "we found that the only difference with the lower density case is that the layer @xmath120 is forming crystallites following the template of the wall . at @xmath125",
    "the layer @xmath120 has a different and incipient crystal structure ( kagome lattice ) with defects that is better defined at lower @xmath18 .",
    "this is evident from the analysis of the @xmath132 that goes to zero for @xmath121 and @xmath141 at @xmath125 .",
    "the layer @xmath126 shows patterns very close to the stripe configuration .",
    "the corresponding @xmath127 goes to zero for @xmath142 and shows a peak for @xmath139 .",
    "these characteristics of the @xmath143 are typical of a stripe phase .",
    "the layer @xmath135 and @xmath136 still show patterns close to the stripe phase , but in a less pronounced way . from the layer @xmath144 to the @xmath145 the pattern is vanishing .",
    "the layer @xmath146 is showing an incipient triangular crystal with lattice step given by the interaction potential attractive distance @xmath130 .",
    "this is evident from the analysis of the @xmath147 that approaches zero for @xmath128 and @xmath129 at @xmath125 .    at @xmath131 the layer @xmath120 is forming a kagome crystal with defects .",
    "the layers from @xmath126 to @xmath145 show a stripe phase and the layer @xmath146 is forming a triangular crystal with defects .    at @xmath137 the kagome crystal of layer",
    "@xmath120 has no defects .",
    "the layers from @xmath126 to @xmath145 are in a stripe phase and the layer @xmath146 is forming a well defined triangular crystal .",
    "as discussed above , the layer @xmath120 close to the solvophilic wall ( @xmath134 ) is subjects to the templating effect for all densities at low temperatures . in fig.[fig : layers_gr_snap ] we compare the @xmath148 and the snapshots of the first layer for @xmath137 at several densities . in order to compare layers , that correspond to different densities , between them",
    ", we considered a portion of each layer of the same size ( @xmath48x@xmath49 of the system at @xmath140 ) . for densities",
    "@xmath149 the first layer is forming a distorted hexagonal lattice characterized by a @xmath148 with a first peak at @xmath150 and vanishing for @xmath121 and @xmath141 . by increasing @xmath53",
    "we observe a progressive shift to higher values of @xmath113 of all the peaks of @xmath148 , but the first that , instead , is becoming more pronounced as a consequence of a better local order . for densities between @xmath151 and @xmath152 the first layer shows a polycrystal phase with coexistence of triangular and square lattices .",
    "this corresponds to an intermediate stage toward the well defined kagome lattice that is formed for @xmath153 , as showed by the splitting of the second peak of @xmath148 into two close peaks at @xmath154 and @xmath155 .      in order to characterize space - dependent diffusion properties of our system , we compute the mean square displacement ( msd ) associated to each layer of the slit .",
    "we observe that , except for low temperatures , a particle can visit different layers in which the aggregation state can change from homogeneous to heterogeneous liquid and vice versa .",
    "for this reason we calculate the msd only for those particles that remain in a layer over the entire time interval under consideration and we average over all possible time interval . therefore , the msd associated to each layer @xmath105 is defined as @xmath156 where @xmath157 is the time spent in the layer @xmath105 by a particle that entered in the layer at time @xmath158 .        in according to the standard definition of the msd , @xmath159 where @xmath160 is the lateral , or parallel , diffusion coefficient and @xmath161 the diffusion exponent .",

    "the system is superdiffusive . on the other hand , for early times free diffusion",
    "we expect the ballistic regime with @xmath166 .",

    "all the layers reach the diffusive ( @xmath164 ) behavior for long times . by decreasing the temperature",
    "the behavior of the layers becomes more heterogeneous .",
    "in particular , we observe that the layer @xmath120 near to the solvophilic wall slows down in a sensible way with respect to the layers at @xmath169 and becomes arrested for @xmath170 . at these temperatures the other layers , including the one near the solvophobic wall , are diffusive at low densities .",
    "however , at @xmath140 and @xmath131 all the layers develop the plateau in the msd typical of glassy dynamics .",
    "this behavior is reminiscent of the caging effect in glasses where the plateau in the msd is followed by a diffusive regime . here ,",
    "instead , at @xmath131 and @xmath140 we observe that for all the layers but the one near the solvophobic wall ( @xmath146 ) , after the plateau , the dynamics enters in a superdiffusive regime with @xmath171 .",
    "this effect is related to the presence of defects and of a nonuniform stress field , as discussed in sec.[sec : structural ] .",

    "the formation of liquid veins is of particular interest in ice during the freezing of water .",
    "recently , experiments and simulations showed the presence of liquid water between nanometer - sized ice crystal @xcite . in polycrystalline systems ,",
    "the liquid is found along intergranular junctions , as grain boundaries ( see @xcite and references therein for the case of water ) .",
    "residual stress in these polycrystal structures can be localized along integranular junctions , and can results in an effective force that acts on fluid particles present in these junctions .",
    "the origin of the residual stress in our system is due to the fact that when the fluid solidifies as the temperature is decreased , the minimization process of the free energy take place locally , instead of globally . in glass forming liquids ,",
    "this effect is caused by a fast cooling , while in our system it is due to the layering of the fluid caused by the confinement .    in fig.[fig : snap_z1 - 2 - 3_rand1 - 2 - 3 ] we show the spatial configuration of the first three layers of the system close to the philic wall , for three different runs ( i.e. for three different realization of initial conditions ) at @xmath137 and @xmath140 .",
    "we observe that particles in the first layer ( @xmath120 ) are characterized by the same msd , while particles in other layers ( @xmath189 ) can have different msd .",
    "in particular in some configurations , we observe veins with mobility higher than the rest of the system ( fig.[fig : config_t_z2-z3 ] ) .",
    "we analyzed the trajectories of the particles of these specific realizations of the system ( fig.[fig : config_t_z2-z3 ] ) .",
    "for these cases we find that these particles with a msd higher than the majority belong to the same stripe and diffuse along the stripe itself .",
    "we observe that the majority of particles in the layer @xmath126 ( and in a less evident way for the layer @xmath135 ( fig.[fig : config_t_z2-z3]b ) , remain spatially localized during the entire simulation , except those belonging to two stripes moving in the same direction as along stripe veins ( fig.[fig : config_t_z2-z3]a ) .",
    "we observe a similar situation for the layer @xmath135 , but here all the particles are more mobile and the particles in the veins move in opposite directions .",
    "further analysis , that goes beyond the goals of the present work , is necessary to understand the effect of the vicinity of the solvophilic wall and if the veins are related to point - like defects as seems to be suggested by fig.[fig : config_t_z2-z3 ] .",

    "we show the trajectories of representative particles belonging to stripes veins .",
    "the msd of these particles is represented with the same color code in fig.[fig : diff_z1 - 2 - 3_rand1 - 2 - 3 ] .",

    ". however , by looking only at the msd and sp is not possible to establish if a solid layer is in an amorphous , crystal or polycrystal state @xcite . in order to better understand the structure of solid layers , we computed the standard 2d voronoi tessellation ( useful to identify defects present in the crystal structures , as vacancies , frenkel - like , dislocations and grain boundaries ) , and a modified version of it ( suitable to identify distorted crystal structures ) . with this analysis",
    "we can also disentagle the role that the three relevant length scales ( the diameter of the particles @xmath3 , the repulsive radius @xmath5 , and the attractive minimum @xmath4 ) , giving rise to two competing length scale @xmath194 and @xmath195 , play in the determination of layer s structure . indeed , the interdistance between two adjacent layers is @xmath196 , while when stripes form in a specific layer for intermediate densities , just to consider a specific case , particles within a stripe are compressed at a distance @xmath197 , while the distance between stripes depends on @xmath196 and @xmath198 , as discussed in the last part of this section .    in the standard voronoi tessellation",
    "we construct polygons centered around particles forming a lattice whose edges are crossed in their middle point by the edges of the voronoi cells .",
    "this procedure garantees that each voronoi cell represent the proper volume of each particle . to better visualize the result",
    ", we represent voronoi cells having a different number of edges with different colors . to reduce the noise in our analysis",
    "we adopt also a modified version of the voronoi tessellation in which we associate a color to a polygon in according to the number of edges of the polygon that have a length @xmath199 larger than that of the average edge lenght calculated over the specific polygon itself .",
    "this procedure allows us to better visualize polycrystal structures despite the presence of small lattice deformations .",
    "we compute the voronoi tessellation for low density ( @xmath118 ) and high density ( @xmath140 ) at low temperature ( @xmath137 ) and very low temperature ( @xmath200 ) , for three different realizations of initial conditions ( figs.[fig : voronoi_rho0.11]a , b , [ fig : voronoi_rho0.30]a , b , and figs.[fig : voronoi_rho0.11_mod2]a , b , [ fig : voronoi_rho0.30_mod2]a , b in supplementary material ) .",
    "the configurations at temperature @xmath200 are obtained by annealing configurations equilibrated at @xmath137 with an annealing rate of @xmath201 .    at low density ( @xmath118 ) , the first layer at @xmath137 ( fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.11_mod2 ] ) is in a frustrated solid state that by annealing toward @xmath200 ( fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.30_mod2 ] ) becomes a frustrated polycrystal .",
    "the very low-@xmath18 polycrystal has point and line defects as grain boundaries dividing a deformed honeycomb lattice ( the deformed green triangles ) from a stripe phase ( the stretched hexagonal cyan polygons ) . for both",
    "considered @xmath123 the other layers are organized in a triangular lattice ( where each particle is surrounded by a hexagonal cyan polygon ) .",
    "we only observe defects , such as dislocations ( run # 2 in fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.11_mod2]a and fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.11]a ) that are not eliminated by annealing ( run # 2 in fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.11_mod2]b ) .    at high density ( @xmath140 ) , the first layer at @xmath137 ( fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.30_mod2]a ) is in a polycrystal state with defects . at @xmath200 ( fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.30_mod2]b )",
    "we observe two principal crystal grains : a triangular lattice ( cyan polygons ) and a kagome lattice with defects ( blue rhombouses ) . at @xmath137 ,",
    "the layers @xmath189 present a zigzagging stripe structure with orientation and angles that can change from run to run . at @xmath200 the stripe structure of these layers becomes more regular .",
    "these observations emphasize that the increase of density induces an increase of disorder in the solid layers , propagating from the layer @xmath120 to the other layers and up to the layer @xmath146 .",
    "the formation of crystal defects during the annealing , and the fact that they are different for different initial conditions , indicate that the system can not reach easely the global minimum of the free energy landscape , corresponding to the crystal configuration , but is trapped in local minima due to the slowing down of the dynamics and the templating effect of the solvophilic wall .",
    "in particular , the mismatch of the wall structure with the bulk crystal structure induces a frustrating effect that is more evident near the wall ( in layers @xmath120 and @xmath126 ) for increasing density .    to understand the formation of stripes , we follow the same approach as in refs  @xcite to show that",
    ", if the principal contribution to the minimization of the free energy comes from the energetic therm , in the discreet potential approximation , under suitable conditions of density and temperature , particles organize in straight or zigzagging stripes . in the discreet potential approximation",
    "the energetic terms can be reduced to the soft core ( @xmath7 ) and the attractive well ( @xmath6 ) . as a consequence",
    "the energetic contribution coming from the interaction with particles of the adjacent layers is approximately constant when the layer density is fixed .",
    "therefore , the energetic cost of stripes formation is determined only by the contribution of the in - layer particle interactions .",
    "in particular , if a layer has a triangular structure , as the stable configuration of layers @xmath2022 , ... , 11 at low density ( fig.[fig : voronoi_rho0.11_mod2]a , b ) , then for sufficiently high density the layer will prefer to form stripes .",
    "2d schematic representation of particles composed by an hard core ( in dark blue ) of size @xmath3 , a soft corona ( in cyan ) of size @xmath5 and an attractive external corona ( in green ) that extends uo to the potential cutoff @xmath203 .",
    "the equilateral and isosceles triangles represent the unitary cell of the triangular and straight - stripes lattice , respectively .",
    "an example of ( maximal ) zigzagging - stripes of the same density of straight - stripes is also shown.,width=264 ]    consider our fluid made of particles with a hard core surrounded by a soft corona and an external attractive corona ( fig.[fig : stripes ] ) .",
    "if @xmath204 is the lattice constant of the triangular structure at the soft - corona distance , then the density of the layer is @xmath205 , where @xmath206 is the number of particles present in this layer . if we allow the triangular lattice to deform in order to minimize the energy of the layer , the new unit cell will be composed by the isosceles triangle in which one side is equal to @xmath39 and the other two are equals to @xmath40 with @xmath207",
    "the fact that the density does nt change implies that @xmath208 .",
    "the energy per particle of the layer is @xmath209u_x+2[(\\sqrt{n_l}-1)/\\sqrt{n_l}]u_y$ ] .",
    "for @xmath210 it becomes @xmath211 , where @xmath212 and @xmath213 are the energy associated to the interaction between the particle along the @xmath39 and @xmath40 side of the triangle respectively .    in the discreet potential approximation it is @xmath214 for @xmath215 , @xmath216 for @xmath217 and @xmath218 for @xmath219 ( note that we obtain the same result if instead of @xmath203 we consider any value between @xmath5 and @xmath203 .",
    "indeed , the present approach has been applyed to show the stability of stripes cnofiguration for a pure repulsive potential model @xcite ) .",
    "the same holds for @xmath213 substituting @xmath39 with @xmath40 .    for sufficiently high density ,",
    "i.e. for @xmath220 or @xmath221 , the energies per particle associated to a layer formed by equilateral or isosceles triangles are @xmath222 or @xmath223 , respectively . therefore ,",
    "under these conditions , the layer will prefer to form stripes .",
    "furthermore , from geometric consideration it is possible to conclude that the zigzagging - stripe lattice can be obtained as a deformation of the straight - stripe lattice without changing the density and keeping the energies per particle @xmath224 @xcite . in general , many different zigzagging stripe lattices are possible all with comparable energy per particle ( fig.[fig : stripes ] ) .    considering the stripes that form in the layers @xmath225 for system density @xmath140 and temperature @xmath137 , the resulting average in - layer density is @xmath226 , and @xmath227 .",
    "hence , from the previous equation for @xmath228 , we find @xmath229 . in view of all the approximation made",
    ", we consider this value consistent with @xmath230 of the distance between the closest particles belonging to two adjacent stripes in the same layer .",
    "by considering many layers of a confined anomalous fluid @xcite we show that the effect of the structured solvophilic wall can extend up to the entire slit pore . in particular , we study structural and dynamical properties of a monocomponent anomalous liquid under confinement .",
    "the fluid has two characteristic distances and can be considered as a coarse - grained model for globular proteins @xcite , colloidal systems @xcite or , to some extent , liquid metals with water - like anomalies @xcite .",
    "we perform molecular dynamics simulations of the fluid in a slit pore with a solvophilic wall and a solvophobic wall .",
    "the solvophilic wall has structure while the solvophobic one has no structure .",
    "we observe that the molecules organize in an inhomogeneous way , forming layers that are parallel to the surfaces , with higher density near the solvophilic surface with respect to the center of the slit pore . for sufficiently high densities ,",
    "for which the fluid occupy entirely the pore , we observe an increase of density also close to the solvophobic surface , but in a less prominent way .",
    "these results are consistent with experimental and theoretical works for nanoconfined fluids .    at low temperature",
    "we observe coexistence between the homogeneous liquid , heterogeneous liquid and solid phase of the fluid .",
    "the influence of the structured solvophilic surface on the solid layers can extend as far as the sixth hydration layer at low @xmath18 and high @xmath53 .",
    "in particular , we find a strong correlation between the structure of the solvophilic surface and that of the first layer suggesting a `` templating '' effect . indeed",
    ", the large density of solvophilic surface particles allows the formation of a first layer at high density .",
    "the high energy cost of this first layer is compensated by the large number of attractive interactions between the particles of the first layer and those of the surface .",
    "further energy gain comes from an extra energy term due to the first in - layer particle interactions .    moving further from the wall",
    ", we find that the first layer has a `` molding '' effect on the second layer .",
    "this is because the density of the first layer is smaller than that of the surface and is not high - enough to propagate its template .",
    "nevertheless , the low - density second layer is in condition to template the third layer replicating its structure and inducing a long - range effect that can , eventually , involve the whole system .    from the calculation of the mean square displacement and the voronoi tessellation",
    "we conclude that at low temperature the first layer close to the solvophilic surface is a polycrystal with two competing phases that generate low - energy states with high degeneracy and very slow dynamics . at low densities",
    "the two competing phases are stripes and honeycomb lattice , while at high densities are triangular and kagome lattice .",
    "we understand this result as a consequence of the high density ( triangular ) structure of the solvophilic wall with a lattice step that corresponds to the hard repulsive distance of the solvent , and the strong wall - solvent attractive interaction .",
    "these properties of the wall generate in the first solvent layer local regions with density and energy that are higher than the average of the layer . as a consequence ,",
    "other regions within the layer have density and energy below the average , giving rise to a competing crystal structure .",
    "our results remind us of some recent experiments and simulations for a thin - film of water on @xmath0 surface for which the authors found a very high density first interfacial layer for all temperatures , while they would expect , from thermodynamic arguments , a lower density liquid at supercooled conditions @xcite .",
    "in other recent experiments and simulations @xcite , the authors pointed out that it is necessary to revise the theory of heterogeneous nucleation when the crystalization induces a non - zero entropy at zero temperature and the system initially is far from equilibrium .",
    "apart from the layers close to the two surfaces , we observe that the structure of each layer mainly depends on its density . in the case of the stripe phase , using simple geometrical and energetic considerations , we find that straight and zigzagging stripes are the stable configurations for intermediate densities .",
    "furtheremore , analysing the mean square displacement layer by layer , we observe layers at high densities and low temperatures with a caging - like behavior characterized by a ballistic dynamics followed by an arrested state ( plateau ) and a superdiffusive regime with a diffusion exponent @xmath171 .",
    "our analysis shows that this behavior is due to the formation of liquid veins within the stripe phase .",
    "in particular we observe that each vein can behave differently from the others diffusing in one of the two possible directions along the stripes and having a different diffusion exponent @xmath171 .",
    "we rationalize the different possible values of @xmath161 as a consequence of the presence of residual stress that could introduce an effective force acting on the fluid . under suitable conditions ,",
    "e.g. a constant effective force along the stripe , the particles in the vein could perform a biased one - dimensional random walk characterized by an exponent of the msd that approaches the ballistic value ( @xmath166 ) .",
    "the behavior of these veins can be analyzed in a more quantitative way by computing , for example , the temporal autocorrelation function , the intermediate scattering function @xcite , the relative displacement of nearest neighbors or the particles displacements following the lindemann criterion @xcite .",
    "we will present this analysis in future works .",
    "our results show that the dynamical slowing down of the anomalous solvent near the solvophilic wall does not imply by necessity the complete freezing of the first hydration layers , because at low @xmath18 and high @xmath53 we observe largely heterogeneous dynamics in three layers with the formation of liquid veins within a frozen matrix of solvent . therefore , under these considerations the partial freezing of the first hydration layer does not correspond necessarily to an effective reduction of the channel section in terms of transport properties , at variance with the conclusions of ref.@xcite .",

    "<S> confinement can modify the dynamics , the thermodynamics and the structural properties of liquid water , the prototypical anomalous liquid . by considering a general anomalous liquid , suitable for globular proteins , colloids or liquid metals , we study by molecular dynamics simulations the effect of a solvophilic structured and a solvophobic unstructured wall on the phases , the crystal nucleation and the dynamics of the fluid . </S>",
    "<S> we find that at low temperatures the large density of the solvophilic wall induces a high - density , high - energy structure in the first layer ( `` templating '' effect ) . in turn </S>",
    "<S> , the first layer induces a `` molding '' effect on the second layer determining a structure with reduced energy and density , closer to the average density of the system . </S>",
    "<S> this low - density , low - energy structure propagates further through the layers by templating effect and can involve all the existing layers at the lowest temperatures investigated . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , although the high - density , high - energy structure does not self - reproduce further than the first layer , the structured wall can have a long - range effect thanks to a sequence of templating , molding and templating effects through the layers . </S>",
    "<S> we find dynamical slowing down of the solvent near the solvophilic wall but with largely heterogeneous dynamics near the wall due to superdiffusive liquid veins within a frozen matrix of solvent . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the partial freezing of the first hydration layer does not correspond necessarily to an effective reduction of the channel section in terms of transport properties . </S>"
