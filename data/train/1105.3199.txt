    "the intimate connection between galaxies environments and their star formation histories is evident in the evolution of the cluster galaxy stellar mass function ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the most massive galaxies in rich clusters today appear to have been in place in progenitor environments since at least @xmath10 ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and there has been little evolution in the number density of the most massive elliptical galaxies in the intervening 8gyr @xcite .",
    "however , significant stellar mass evolution is still required in the remainder of the cluster population during this period @xcite .",
    "the key features of this evolution are : ( a ) a steepening of the faint - end towards @xmath11 , that is , low - mass end of the luminosity function @xcite ; and ( b ) the appearance of a population of passive , massive lenticular ( s0 ) galaxies in the cores of clusters since @xmath12 @xcite .    the increase in the fraction of low - mass galaxies",
    "can be explained by the continuous accretion of satellite galaxies ( with subsequent gas stripping and the cessation of further cooling preventing further growth ) .",
    "the formation of s0s can only be accounted for in an evolutionary sequence connecting distant gas - rich discs undergoing a period of additional star formation to build up the total stellar mass and enhancement of bulge - to - disc ratios ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "until relatively recently , evidence for the large star formation rates ( sfrs ) required for such a transformation in the spiral populations of intermediate redshift clusters was lacking .",
    "however , since the advent of sensitive mid- and ( now ) far - infrared panoramic surveys , several studies have now revealed a population of hitherto optically hidden star - forming galaxies in rich clusters over @xmath13 ( e.g.  @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "it has become clear that these obscured star - forming galaxies could be responsible for strong evolution in the stellar mass function of even rich clusters since @xmath12 .",
    "thus , not only does this population provide a key insight into various environmental effects on the star formation histories of relatively ` normal ' galaxies , but it also represents an important stage in the overall shaping of the galaxy population today .",
    "the globally - averaged total sfr in rich clusters as well as the average field has been in strong decline since @xmath12 , although it is unclear how the strength of the evolution is tied to galaxies environments .",
    "indeed infrared studies have revealed significant variation in the sfrs of individual clusters @xcite .",
    "it is thought that the origin of this variation could be rooted in the different environmental conditions specific to different clusters , such as sub - structure , dynamical state , thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium ( icm ) , etc .",
    "the next step in understanding this variation , and building up a more statistical picture of the evolution of the obscured star - forming populations of clusters since @xmath12 , is to turn to wide - field panoramic infrared surveys of a much larger sample of clusters and groups covering a large dynamic range of environment .",
    "while previous surveys undertaken with _ spitzer _ and the _ infrared space observatory ( iso ) _ have mapped the mid - infrared emission ( e.g.  1524@xmath14 m ) of clusters , panoramic far - infrared surveys have so far been challenging . both ground- and",
    "space - based surveys have lacked the field - of - view , sensitivity and resolution to cover large areas down to the required depths to pin - point the obscured star - forming galaxy population ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "space telescope @xcite has enabled us to move beyond these limitations ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite and pacs @xcite survey , and  when complete  will cover an area of @xmath15deg@xmath16 from 100500@xmath14 m .",
    "the large volume probed will contain a large number of galaxy clusters , and the sensitivity of the far - infrared observations will allow us to systematically search for obscured star - forming galaxies in their vicinity .",
    "this letter presents a statistical analysis of the _ herschel _ spire sources in the core of @xmath17 clusters as mapped by the science demonstration phase ( sdp ) h - atlas observations , covering a @xmath18deg@xmath16 field at 9@xmath19 ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our goals are twofold : ( a ) to search for _ statistical _ evidence of dust - obscured star formation activity in this cluster population ; and ( b ) to identify any candidate cluster - lensed sources for further study and follow - up .",
    "this paper is organised as follows : we describe our unique cluster detection algorithm and the h - atlas sdp spire catalogue in   [ sample ] , the statistical analysis and results of the h - atlas and cluster catalogue cross - correlation in   [ analysis ] , and summarise our findings in   [ summary ] . throughout",
    "we assume cosmological parameters from the _ wmap _ fits in @xcite : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22kms@xmath7mpc@xmath7 .",
    "we have used the technique presented in @xcite to identify clusters of galaxies from panoramic optical imaging .",
    "briefly , the method uses a series of colour selections to first isolate ` red - sequence ' cluster members ( those where the 4000  break is bracketed by two filters ) , followed by the construction of a voronoi diagram of the projected galaxy distribution .",
    "clusters and groups are identified as associations of voronoi cells , sharing at least one vertex between cells , with areas significantly lower ( i.e.  higher galaxy surface densities ) than would be expected if the galaxies were randomly distributed on the sky . in this case",
    "we used photometry from the sloan digital sky survey @xcite 7th data release ( sdss dr7 ; @xcite ) . for the selection ,",
    "we employed galactic extinction corrected modelmag in the @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands ; see @xcite for a description of the sdss photometric system .",
    "the minimum number of ` connected ' galaxies that qualify as a cluster is five .",
    "the position of the cluster core is defined as the average of the positions of the member galaxies voronoi cells , however we also define a ` brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) centre ' as the location of the brightest cluster member in the @xmath26-band .",
    "apertures placed on the cluster core defined by the geometric mean provide the most complete coverage of the member galaxies .",
    "we find 66 clusters within the h - atlas sdp coverage of @xmath27deg@xmath16 .",
    "the redshifts of the clusters have been estimated from the photometric ( and in some cases spectroscopic ) redshifts of the cluster members ( @xcite ) .",
    "we note that 36 members out of a total of 549 galaxies across all clusters have spectroscopic redshifts from sdss ( 6.5% ) . for sources with spectroscopic redshifts , the mean",
    "spectroscopic - to - photometric redshift offset is -0.0018 , with a standard deviation of 0.017 .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .",

    "fig : histogram ] ) . based on tests performed on mock catalogues ,",
    "the cluster catalogue is @xmath3090% complete at a halo mass of @xmath31m@xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the number of false positives can be estimated by randomly shuffling the colours of galaxies ( while keeping the positions fixed ) and re - running the detection algorithm . at the lower membership limit",
    ", the number of false detections is expected to be 0.06deg@xmath32 or @xmath33 of the 66 clusters .",
    "further details of the cluster algorithm , selection and completeness can be found in @xcite .",
    "we estimate the cluster richness using the commonly used @xmath34 statistic , an approximation of the amplitude of the real - space correlation function @xcite .",

    "the h - atlas sdp catalogue consists of 6876 sources detected at @xmath40 in either of the 250 , 350 or 500@xmath14 m bands over a @xmath27deg@xmath16 region @xcite .",
    "the 5-@xmath41 point source sensitivity limits ( including confusion noise ) are 34 , 38 , and 44mjy at 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath14 m , respectively . @xcite",
    "have employed a likelihood ratio ( lr ) method to perform the optical cross - identifications of the 6621 250@xmath14m - detected sources with the sdss dr7 catalogue with a limiting _ r_-band magnitude of 22.4 @xcite .",
    "the lr technique assigns a reliability , @xmath42 , to each match and indicates the probability that the counterpart is the correct identification .",
    "of the 6876 h - atlas sources , 2423 are thus classified as having a reliable ( @xmath43 ) optical counterpart , and the remaining 4453 as optically unidentified ( @xmath44 or no optical counterparts ) .",
    "the first step of our analysis is to simply measure the surface density of h - atlas sources ( both optically identified and unidentified ) as a function of projected clusto - centric radius around the 66 clusters ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . as a field control sample ,",
    "we repeat this exercise 1000 times for a set of 66 random positions across the field .",
    "as expected , at large radii the surface density around the clusters is indistinguishable from the average ` field ' estimate , however there is a clear positive excess of far - infrared sources within @xmath45 ( 1.2mpc for @xmath46 ) of the clusters , the significance of which peaks at @xmath47 .",
    "there is an average excess of @xmath0 source per cluster over the background , although note that by definition the cluster environments are characterised by an excess surface density of galaxies .",
    "the total number of h - atlas sources detected within @xmath48 of the 66 clusters is 401 , representing a @xmath49 excess of @xmath50 sources ( the error is poisson ) above the background signal of @xmath51 sources on average ( the error is the standard error of the mean ) . at a radius of @xmath52 from the 66 clusters , we find 719 sources ( a less significant excess of @xmath53 sources over our monte carlo estimated background signal of @xmath54 at the same clustocentric radius ) . for comparison , we have also repeated the above analysis using the projected radius from the bcg as the cluster centre , and the signal in the @xmath55 bin clearly increases ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] )  with six h - atlas sources lying within 8arcsec of bcgs ( note that the 250@xmath14 m psf is 19arcsec ) .",
    "this suggests that several h - atlas sources are associated with the bcgs , either by lensing a background far - infrared source or that the far - infrared emission is from the bcg itself , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "we have quantified the likelihood of finding this excess signal by chance by using our monte carlo simulations and find that for radii @xmath56 ( where the maximum excess signal occurs ) we would expect to see our average detected surface density @xmath57% of the time in randomly sampled apertures of equivalent size in the field .",
    "the simulations also reveal that at radii larger than about @xmath52 the random chance of detecting our measured surface density ( or greater ) near the clusters above the background becomes @xmath58% and increases rapidly beyond @xmath52 .",
    "thus , for the following statistical analyses we use the 719 h - atlas sources found within @xmath52 of the 66 clusters , which strikes a good balance of identifying the majority of the sources responsible for the excess signal while keeping the background field contribution to the signal to a minimum .",
    "we have calculated the surface density of h - atlas sources in angular bins , regardless of the individual cluster redshift .",
    "an alternative approach would be to calculate the surface density as a function of physical projected radius , which would be important for broad redshift distributions .",
    "we conducted such an analysis as a check , by counting h - atlas sources within variable angular radii corresponding to a particular physical scale around the clusters .",
    "we calculate the field estimate using the same monte carlo technique as above , but using 66 apertures randomly drawn from a distribution function matching the cluster redshift distribution , repeating this 1000 times ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the resulting surface density profile closely matches that found for angular bins , which is not surprising given our narrow redshift distribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : histogram ] ) , with the excess signal arising within @xmath59mpc of the cluster cores , in agreement with the ` average ' physical scale shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "there are two distinct physical origins for the excess signal : ( a ) obscured star formation or active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in cluster members ; and ( b ) gravitational lensing of background sources .",
    "the majority of the h - atlas sources in low redshift clusters are expected to have optical counterparts , whereas h - atlas sources with no robust counterpart are most likely to be at higher redshift ( except in the case of galaxy - galaxy lensing , where the foreground lensing galaxy is identified as the counterpart ) . splitting the sample into optically identified and unidentified sub - samples",
    "therefore provides a crude method of determining if the excess signal seen around clusters comes from the cluster members themselves , or from strongly lensed background sources . from the 719 h - atlas sources found within 5@xmath60 of the 66 clusters",
    ", we find that 268 ( 37% ) have optical counterparts with the remaining 451 ( 63% ) having no optical counterpart . to examine the relative contribution to the far - infrared excess signal , we repeat the radial surface density analysis described above for these two sub - samples separately .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the majority of the excess signal seen in the full sample is due to the _ optically identified _",
    "h - atlas sources ; while the surface density of optically unidentified h - atlas sources around clusters is essentially statistically indistinguishable from the random field .",
    "we thus now focus our attention on the optically identified sources around the clusters and defer a discussion of the nature of the optically unidentified sources to section  [ unid ] .",
    "we have determined that the excess signal of far - infrared emission around the low - redshift cluster sample comes from h - atlas sources with robust optical counterparts .",
    "these could be cases where a foreground galaxy is lensing a background source @xcite ( where the lensing galaxy is the optical counterpart of the h - atlas source ) , or the far - infrared emission is from the galaxy itself .",
    "is there any evidence to suggest that the majority of the optically identified h - atlas sources have redshifts consistent with the clusters ?",
    "we now perform a test to search for evidence that the far - infrared colours of h - atlas sources around the clusters are consistent with the redshift of the clusters .",
    "the optical photometric redshifts of the optical counterparts of the h - atlas sources are not useful for reliably distinguishing galaxy - galaxy lensing from the cluster members , since it is likely that in the case of galaxy - galaxy lensing , a far - infrared source would be identified with the lensing galaxy instead of the true background lensed source ( which would be too faint / obscured to be seen in the optical ) .",
    "follow - up millimetre studies that can positively identify the molecular gas emission of the high - redshift source , unambiguously separating it in redshift space from the foreground galaxy , is arguably the best technique . in lieu of those data",
    ", we can crudely use the far - infrared colours as a rough redshift discriminator , since the 250 , 350 , and 500@xmath14 m bands sample near the dusty spectral energy distribution ( sed ) peak .",
    "thus , following e.g.  @xcite we compare the @xmath61 and @xmath62 spire colours of the optically identified versus unidentified h - atlas cluster - matched sources to test if the optically identified sources are more consistent with being lower redshift cluster members and the optically unidentified sources more consistent with being background or cluster - lensed higher redshift sources .",
    "we note that not of all the h - atlas sources have direct detections in all three spire bands ( and thus errors on the colours of those individual sources will be large ) . additionally , we note that @xmath63% of the 500@xmath14 m sources are likely blends of multiple sources ( within a relatively large beamsize of @xmath64 ) , with their flux boosted by up to a factor of @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "we thus place more emphasis on the results involving the 250@xmath14 m flux densities , which should suffer less from these effects due to the relatively smaller beamsize ( @xmath66 ) , but use the 500@xmath14 m flux densities as a consistency check .",
    "we use a kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test to compare the @xmath61 and @xmath62 colours of the optically identified subset of 268 cluster - matched h - atlas sources with the 451 optically unidentified cluster - matched h - atlas sources to search for evidence of any differences between the colour distributions that would hint at an overall redshift difference between the two samples .",
    "the ks test reveals that there is a @xmath67 chance that they are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "the optically identified cluster - matched h - atlas sources have bluer @xmath68 colours and bluer @xmath69 colours on average than the optically unidentified cluster - matched h - atlas sources ( @xmath70 ; @xmath71 ) . if we assume the median @xmath72l@xmath73l@xmath9 uv - submm template from smith et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for a ` typical ' h - atlas galaxy sed , then these mean colours roughly indicate that the optically identified cluster - matched h - atlas sources , on average , lie at redshifts of @xmath74 ( consistent with the cluster redshifts ) and that the optically unidentified sources are at typically higher redshifts of @xmath10 .",
    "we thus conclude that the origin of the far - infrared excess signal around the clusters originates from sources within the clusters themselves .",
    "these galaxies are likely to be obscured star - forming galaxies or agn .",
    "we note that although the actual agn content of clusters as a function of time is still fairly poorly constrained , there is evidence that the infrared emission of the general cluster population ( i.e. galaxies on the outskirts of clusters ) is generated by star formation @xcite .",
    "we do expect some instances of galaxy - galaxy lensing in the optically identified sample .",
    "cases of galaxy - galaxy lensing could potentially be enhanced around clusters simply due to the increased surface density of foreground galaxies , and the increased mass density cross - section in cluster regions can boost amplification further galaxy lensed in a near - perfect einstein ring by a @xmath75 elliptical that meets the threshold for strong lensing _ only _ because we are viewing the @xmath75 galaxy through a foreground @xmath76 cluster @xmath77 away . ] .",
    "therefore , a lensing galaxy may have a clear optical identification as a background source , but could be lensed further due to the presence of the cluster along the line of sight .",
    "we note that out of five instances of strongly lensed optically identified h - atlas sources identified by @xcite , one of these lies within @xmath52 of a cluster core .",
    "this is strictly a lower limit on the occurrences of galaxy - galaxy lensing in our sample , however , the actual number of such cases is not expected to dominate the optically identified spire sources in our sample , given their typical 500@xmath14 m fluxes and far - infrared colours described above .",
    "if we now assume that the detected far - infrared emission is due to obscured star formation ( as opposed to agn ) within the clusters then we can use the background - subtracted luminosity function to estimate the average level of star formation in the @xmath74 clusters .",
    "we integrate a background - subtracted histogram of the 250@xmath14 m flux density of the optically identified cluster - matched h - atlas sources ( see fig .  [ fig2 ] ) to yield a total flux contribution of 1.6jy over the 66 clusters , or @xmath524mjy per cluster . assuming this is a proxy for dusty star formation we can convert this to a total sfr by estimating the integrated total ( 81000@xmath14 m ) infrared luminosity of the median h - atlas galaxy template with @xmath72l@xmath73l@xmath9 from smith et al .",
    "( in preparation ) redshifted to @xmath46 ( which is well - matched to our sample far - infrared colours ; see section  [ excess ] ) and normalised to the relevant 250@xmath14 m flux density .",
    "we find an average sfr per cluster of @xmath78m@xmath6yr@xmath7 , applying the sfr calibration of 81000@xmath14 m integrated luminosity of @xcite .",
    "the error range on the estimate represents the inferred difference in total luminosity within the redshift range of @xmath79 .",
    "we note that a systematic uncertainty in the sfr estimate comes from our assumed sed , although this should not be a significant effect , since we have used an sed template based on the h - atlas galaxies themselves within this redshift range . nevertheless , for example",
    "if an arp220 or m82 sed is assumed ( which have been shown to be inappropriate for our sample ; see smith et al .  in preparation )",
    "we find an sfr systematically higher by a factor of @xmath80 or @xmath81 , respectively .",
    "the total sfr of the clusters should also be considered a lower limit , given the 250@xmath14 m sensitivity ; since we only probe down to @xmath82l@xmath6 , we also expect a contribution from dust - obscured galaxies below this limit . for example , assuming the shape of the hermes 250@xmath14 m luminosity function ( @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , if we could probe to a flux limit of @xmath81mjy we would expect an additional @xmath83 sources down to @xmath84l@xmath6 , contributing an _ additional _ @xmath85m@xmath6yr@xmath7 per cluster .",
    "how does this compare to the total cluster - integrated sfr derived from the uv alone ? to estimate the uv integrated sfr for the clusters , we evaluate the total sdss @xmath86-band flux density within 5@xmath60 of each cluster ( corrected for galactic extinction ) , and perform a field correction based on the total flux within randomly placed apertures across the field .",
    "we only sum the excess in galaxies not on the red - sequence ( as these are not present in the field ) , and derive an average total cluster integrated sfr of @xmath520m@xmath6yr@xmath7 , assuming the @xcite sfr calibration .",
    "thus , the total uv - derived rate appears to be comparable to the total far - infrared - derived rate , but of course with the caveats that ( a ) the uv - derived value is likely integrated further down the cluster luminosity function due to higher sensitivity to star formation in lower mass systems , and indeed includes many galaxies with low activity missed by the far - infrared survey , and ( b ) there is a large uncertainty in a simple conversion between the monochromatic @xmath86-band to sfr , and ( c ) we have not corrected for potentially non - negligible @xmath86-band emission from stars not associated with new star formation in red galaxies in the clusters ( although we excluded the main red sequence ) .    with these caveats in mind ,",
    "it is clear that the far - infrared - derived integrated sfr provides a superior estimate of the total level of star formation activity in the clusters , with the main uncertainty being the calibration of total far - infrared luminosity to sfr .",
    "however , it is also evident that the current limits of this h - atlas survey are missing part of the low - level activity in the clusters , as revealed by our simple uv estimates and extrapolation of the hermes luminosity function .",
    "our measurements should therefore be taken as lower limits to the integrated sfrs of these clusters , as mentioned previously .",
    "if the total far - infrared - derived sfr of the clusters is normalised by total ( luminous+dark ) mass , we have a simple method to compare the activity in different environments , and the evolution of the cluster sfr budget over time ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the mass estimates for these clusters are indirectly inferred from their optical richnesses ( see section  [ cluster ] ) , which gives the range @xmath51.516@xmath87m@xmath6  however , the conversion between optical richness and mass is highly uncertain , and the true masses are likely to be at the lower end of this range . even this might be an over - estimate of the total cluster mass .",
    "for example , to achieve a similar surface density of clusters in the millennium simulation @xcite , requires us to be probing to a mass limit of @xmath88 .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the average total sfr in our clusters compared to other infrared - derived rates in other clusters over @xmath89 , although we note that given the large uncertainties on the h - atlas cluster masses and the cool sed we have adopted , we consider our point to be a lower limit .",
    "we note that if other infrared studies at similar redshifts and depths assume m82- or arp220-like templates for their cluster member galaxies when cooler h - atlas - type seds are more appropriate , then they may well be overestimating the level of star formation activity in those clusters .",
    "although there is significant cluster - to - cluster scatter , in general there has been strong evolution of the cluster sfr ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this is consistent with the scenario that there has been a sharper drop - off in the star formation activity of clusters since @xmath10 than occurs in the field , probably related to the build up of virialised structures hostile to on - going activity and gas cooling over this period .",
    "although the optically unidentified sources within @xmath52 of the clusters do not contribute significantly to the excess signal seen in section  [ sec1 ] and appear to lie at typically higher redshifts ( @xmath10 ) on average than the optically identified h - atlas sources ( section  [ excess ] )  these results suggest that strong gravitational lensing by the cluster potential is not a major contributor to the detected excess signal .",
    "still , they represent an interesting sample , since they could contain strongly lensed galaxies .",
    "they thus provide potential opportunities to study the properties of intrinsically fainter far - infrared sources at high-@xmath90 than would otherwise be possible .",
    "it is possible that some of these galaxies could be galaxies at or below the cluster redshift , but are very highly obscured , although we note that @xcite do not see evidence for a significant population of optically - faint low-@xmath90 sources . as a simple test for this , we consider a prototypical ultraluminous infrared galaxy ( ulirg ) with extreme reddening at uv - optical wavelengths : arp220 ( @xmath91mag , with @xmath92mag in the most central 300pc and much higher in the nuclei ; vermaas & van der werf in preparation ) . by redshifting this template to the cluster redshifts , and normalising it to the observed 250@xmath14 m flux ( the most sensitive band with the best angular resolution",
    ") we can assess whether we would have detected its optical counterpart by convolving the optical portion of the sed with , say , an @xmath26-band filter .",
    "if the predicted optical flux is above the limit of the observations of this field , then the galaxy would require even further extinction on top of the arp220 template or a different k - correction , implying a different ( higher ) redshift to the cluster .",
    "we find that all of the galaxies without current optical identifications are classified as high-@xmath90 sources using this method , with predicted @xmath93 at least one magnitude brighter than the 22.4mag sdss limit .",
    "the 451 optically unidentified h - atlas sources are thus candidate lensed sources .",
    "although the amplification factor falls off rapidly with radius for all sensible mass profiles , it is worth noting that the einstein radius for these clusters is expected to be @xmath52040@xmath94 for a mass range of 1@xmath95m@xmath9 .",
    "therefore , only a fraction of the 451 optically unidentified h - atlas sources are expected to be highly magnified .",
    "thus , from the 451 candidate lensed sources , we have singled out those sources lying within 1@xmath60 ( @xmath96mpc ) of the cluster centres for further study , amounting to 14 strong lens candidates ( see table  [ tab ] ) .",

    "we have detected a significant excess of optically identified far - infrared sources within @xmath143mpc of the centres of optically - selected clusters of galaxies with @xmath144 in the sdp h - atlas field .",
    "assuming that the excess signal is completely dominated by star formation ( rather than agn ) , the far - infrared excess corresponds to an average sfr of @xmath145m@xmath6yr@xmath7 per cluster .",
    "the average cluster far - infrared sfr is consistent with mass - normalised sfrs from previous work .",
    "if the observed sfr in these clusters is maintained over the 3gyr since @xmath46 , then the activity could contribute @xmath146m@xmath9 of new stellar mass in the clusters  enough to construct a typical s0 bulge .",
    "our average integrated sfr for the clusters can be considered a lower - limit , since we expect additional contribution from obscured sources below the sensitivity limit of the h - atlas observations .",
    "this evolution is necessary for the observed increase in the fraction of massive ( bulge dominated ) lenticular galaxies in the cores of clusters over the same time period .",
    "finally , we have determined that the optically unidentified h - atlas sources within 5@xmath60 ( @xmath147mpc ) of the cluster cores are higher - redshift background sources , some of which could be strongly lensed by the cluster , and we have compiled a list of lensed candidates for further study .",
    "the future full h - atlas coverage will be sufficiently large that this analysis can be repeated and extended as a function of cluster redshift and mass .",
    "in addition , this analysis could be applied to targetted spire observations of galaxy clusters .",
