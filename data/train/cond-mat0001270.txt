    "star polymers @xcite , i.e. , structures of @xmath0 linear polymer chains that are chemically linked with one end to a common core , have found recent interest as very soft colloidal particles @xcite . as the number @xmath0 of chains increases , they interpolate between linear polymers and polymeric micelles @xcite . for large @xmath0 ,",
    "the effective repulsion between the cores of different polymer stars becomes strong enough to allow for crystalline ordering in a concentrated star polymer solution .",
    "while such a behavior was already predicted by early scaling arguments @xcite only recently corresponding experiments have become feasible with sufficiently dense star solutions .",
    "the crystallization transition occurs roughly at the overlap concentration @xmath1 which is the number density of stars where their coronae start to touch experiencing the mutual repulsion .",
    "it is defined as @xmath2 where @xmath3 , the radius of gyration , is the root mean square distance of the monomers from the center of mass of a single star .",
    "in addition , theory and computer simulation have refined the original estimate for the number of chains @xmath0 necessary for a freezing transition from @xmath4 @xcite to @xmath5 @xcite and predicted a rich phase diagram including stable anisotropic and diamond solid structures at high densities and high arm numbers .",
    "these results were derived using an effective _ pair potential _ between stars with a logarithmic short distance behavior derived from scaling theory .    in general , while the pair interactions are the central focus and the typical input of any many - body theory , much less is known about triplet and higher - order many body interactions . for rare gases",
    ", the axilrod - teller triplet interaction @xcite has been found to become relevant in order to describe high - precision measurements of the structure factor @xcite . for charged colloids ,",
    "the effective triplet forces are generated by nonlinear counterion screening .",
    "this was investigated recently by theory and simulations @xcite . for star polymer solutions in a good solvent such studies are missing . in all three cases ,",
    "the effective triplet forces originate from formally integrating out microscopic degrees of freedom . for rare gases , these are the fluctuations of the outer - shell electrons while for charged colloids the classical counterions play the role of additional microscopic degrees of freedom . for star polymers , on the other hand ,",
    "one is interested in an effective interaction between the star centers by integrating out the monomer degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "usually one starts from an effective pair potential which is valid for large particle separation .",
    "the range of this effective pair potential involves a certain length scale @xmath6 which is the decay length of the van - der - waals attraction , the debye - hckel screening length or the diameter of gyration @xmath7 , for rare gases , charged colloids , and star polymers , respectively .",
    "triplet forces , i.e. three star forces , not forces between monomers , become relevant with respect to the pairwise forces if the typical separations between the particles are smaller than this typical length scale @xmath6 .",
    "this implies a triple overlap of particle coronae drawn as spheres of diameter @xmath6 around the particle centers .",
    "the triple overlap volume is an estimate for the magnitude of the triplet forces .",
    "hence a three - particle configuration on an equilateral triangle is the configuration where triplet effects should be most pronounced .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to quantify the influence of triplet interactions for star polymer solutions in a good solvent using both analytical theory and computer simulation . in doing so",
    ", we consider a set - up of three star polymers whose centers are on an equilateral triangle .",
    "we found that the triplet part is attractive but its relative contribution is small ( 11% ) with respect to the repulsive pairwise part .",
    "this relative correction is universal , i.e. , it is independent of the particle separation and of the arm number .",
    "it even persists for a collinear configuration of three star polymers where the absolute correction is smaller than in the triangular situation for the same star - star distance .",
    "consequently , the validity of the effective pair potential model is justified even at densities above the overlap concentration . in particular",
    ", our result gives evidence that the anisotropic and diamond solids predicted by the pair theory are indeed realizable in actual samples of concentrated star polymer solutions .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in section ii we apply scaling theory to extract the triplet forces both for small and for large arm numbers . in section iii",
    "we briefly describe our molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation scheme and present results in section iv . comparing these to the theoretical predictions",
    ", we find good agreement .",
    "section v is devoted to concluding remarks and to an outlook .",
    "the scaling theory of polymers was significantly advanced by de gennes observation that the @xmath8-component spin model of magnetic systems is applicable to polymers in the formal @xmath9 limit @xcite .",
    "this opened the way to apply renormalization group ( rg ) theory to explain the scaling properties of polymer solutions that have been the subject of experimental and theoretical investigations since the pioneering works in this field @xcite .",
    "many details of the behavior of polymer solutions may be derived using the rg analysis @xcite . here",
    ", we use only the more basic results of power law scaling : the radius of gyration @xmath10 of a polymer chain and the partition function @xmath11 are found to obey the power laws : @xmath12 the fugacity @xmath13 measures the mean number of possibilities to add one monomer to the chain .",
    "it is microscopic in nature and will depend on the details of the model or experimental system .",
    "the two exponents @xmath14 and @xmath15 on the contrary are the @xmath9 limits of the correlation length exponent @xmath16 and the susceptibility exponent @xmath17 of the @xmath8 component model and are universal to all polymer systems in a good solvent , i.e. , excluding high concentration of polymers or systems in which the polymers are collapsed or are near the collapse transition . for any such system the exponents of any other power law for linear polymers may be expressed by these two exponents in terms of scaling relations .",
    "it has been shown that the @xmath8 component spin model may be extended by insertions of so called composite spin operators that allow to describe polymer networks and in particular star polymers in the @xmath9 limit @xcite .",
    "a family of additional exponents @xmath18 governs the scaling of the partition function @xmath19 of a polymer star of @xmath0 chains each with @xmath20 monomers : @xmath21 again the exponents of any other power law for more general polymer networks are given by scaling relations in terms of @xmath18 and @xmath14 . here , we substitute another family of exponents @xmath22 to replace @xmath23 . the first two members @xmath24 and @xmath25 are defined by the requirement that the @xmath26 star and the @xmath27 star are just linear chains with scaling exponents @xmath28 .",
    "the values of these exponents are known from renormalization group analysis ( rg ) and monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite .",
    "several equivalent approaches have been elaborated to evaluate the renormalized perturbation theory .",
    "early first order perturbative rg results were given in ref .",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we explicitly present the result of an expansion in the parameter @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the space dimension .",
    "the @xmath31-expansion for the @xmath22 reads @xcite @xmath32 \\big\\ } + { \\cal o}(\\varepsilon^4 )   \\label{2a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with the riemann @xmath33-function .",
    "note that this series is asymptotic in nature and to evaluate it for @xmath34 it is necessary to apply resummation .",
    "an alternative expansion for the star exponents makes use of an rg approach at fixed dimension @xmath35 proposed by parisi @xcite .",
    "this expansion has been worked out in refs . @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expressions are lengthy and not presented here . in table 1 , in the first two lines we have calculated the resummation for the series in eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) as well as for the expansion at fixed dimension .",
    "the resummation procedure that we apply combines a borel transform with a conformal mapping using all information on the asymptotic behavior of the perturbation expansion of the corresponding spin model @xcite .",
    "results for @xmath36 have been given before in refs .",
    "@xcite whereas we have added here the calculation of values for @xmath37 .",
    "the deviation between the two approaches measures the error of the method . for large @xmath0 the leading coefficient of the @xmath38th order term @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ 2a ] ) is multiplied by @xmath40 .",
    "this is due to combinatorial reasons and occurs also for the alternative approach .",
    "it limits the use of the series to low values of @xmath0 .",
    "another possibility to estimate the values of the star polymer scaling exponents @xmath18 is to consider the limiting case of many arm star polymers . for large @xmath0 each chain of the star",
    "is restricted approximately to a cone of solid angle @xmath41 . in this cone approximation one",
    "finds for large @xmath0 @xcite @xmath42      let us now turn to the effective interaction between the cores of two star polymers at small distances @xmath43 that are small on the scale of the size @xmath3 of the stars .",
    "let us for the moment consider a more general case of two star polymers with @xmath44 and @xmath45 arms respectively .",
    "the cores of the two stars are at a distance @xmath43 from each other .",
    "we assume all chains involved to be of the same length .",
    "the power law for the partition sum @xmath46 of two star polymers may then be derived from a short distance expansion .",
    "this expansion is originally established in the field theoretic formulation of the @xmath8 component spin model .",
    "while we do not intend to give any details of these considerations here , applications to polymer theory may be found in refs .",
    "the relevant result on the other hand is simple enough : the partition sum of the two stars @xmath47 at small distance @xmath43 factorizes into a function @xmath48 of @xmath43 alone and the partition function @xmath49(n ) of the star with @xmath50 arms that is formed when the cores of the two stars coincide .",
    "@xmath51 for the function @xmath48 one may show that power law scaling for small @xmath43 holds in the form @xmath52 with the contact exponent @xmath53 . to find the scaling relation for this power law we we change the length scale in ( [ 4 ] ) in an invariant way by @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "the scaling of the partition function @xmath56 may be shown to factorize into the contributions for the two stars .",
    "this transforms ( [ 4 ] ) to @xmath57 collecting powers of @xmath58 provides the scaling relation @xmath59    we now specialize our consideration to the interaction between two stars of equal number of arms @xmath60 .",
    "the mean force @xmath61 between the two star polymers at short distance @xmath43 is then easily derived from the effective potential @xmath62 $ ] with @xmath63 denoting the thermal energy .",
    "for the force this results in @xmath64 the cone approximation for the contact exponents @xcite @xmath65 may be matched to the known values for @xmath66 ( see table 1 ) , fixing the otherwise unknown prefactor .",
    "assuming that the behavior of the @xmath65 may be described by the cone approximation for all @xmath0 one finds : @xmath67 this matching in turn suggests an approximate value for the @xmath22 exponents , @xmath68 note on the other hand that this approximation is inconsistent with the exact result @xmath24 .",
    "however , the approximation works well for @xmath65 in the range @xmath69 were we have calculated the corresponding values from the perturbation theory results as well as according to the cone approximation .",
    "our results , displayed in the second part of table 1 , show good correspondence of the cone approximation with the resummation values .",
    "we now use the idea of the short distance expansion once more to derive the triplet interaction of three star polymers at close distance .",
    "we consider a symmetric situation in which the three cores of the polymer stars are located on the corners of an equilateral triangle ( see fig .",
    "the distance between the cores is @xmath43 while their distance to the center of the triangle is @xmath70 .",
    "we assume that the radius of gyration @xmath3 of the star polymers is much larger than their mutual distance @xmath71 .    to make the argument more transparent we first consider the slightly more general case of three stars with @xmath44 , @xmath45 and @xmath72 arms respectively .",
    "shrinking the outer radius @xmath70 of the triangle on which the cores are located , the partition function of this configuration of three stars will scale with @xmath70 according to @xmath73 now , the scaling exponent @xmath74 of the star that results by collapsing the cores of the three stars at one point has to be taken into account as follows from an argument analogous to the above consideration for two stars .",
    "let us specify the result for the symmetric situation of three equivalent stars @xmath75 .",
    "furthermore we assume that the large @xmath0 approximation ( [ 8 ] ) is valid for the exponents @xmath22 .",
    "then the three star contact exponent may be written as @xmath76 an effective potential of the system of the three stars at small distance @xmath70 from the center may then be defined by @xmath77 we now derive the corresponding three body force underlying this effective potential .",
    "note that the absolute value of the force is the same for all three stars .",
    "the relation of the potential to the force on the core of one star is then @xmath78 the final result for the total force on each of the stars that includes any three body forces is therefore @xmath79 if one starts instead from a sum of two body forces , then one star experiences the sum of the two forces calculated for the star - star interaction . with the given geometry of the equilateral triangle this",
    "is easily calculated to give @xmath80 here , @xmath81 denote the distance between two of the stars , while the @xmath82 are the unit vectors along the edges of the triangle ( see fig.1 ) . the relative deviation from the pair potential picture",
    "is then given by @xmath83 using the cone approximation for the contact exponent we finally obtain for the relative deviation caused by triplet forces alone @xmath84 this result is independent of the number of arms and valid in the full region that is described by the logarithmic potential . in table 1",
    "we have calculated the exponents as derived from the perturbation expansion of polymer field theory @xcite checking the relation eq .",
    "( [ 15a ] ) . taking into account the error that may be estimated from the difference of the results obtained by the two complementary approaches , the results are in good agreement with the cone approximation even for low @xmath0 values .",
    "the fair coincidence is rather surprising as additional numerical errors might be introduced by the calculation of the contact exponents from the original star exponents .",
    "it confirms our estimate of the relative deviation caused by triplet forces to be of the order of not more than @xmath85 for all analytic approaches we have followed here .",
    "let us note that the analogous calculation for a symmetric linear configuration of three stars yields the same relative deviation eq .",
    "( [ 15a ] ) .",
    "the absolute triplet forces for the linear configuration are smaller by a factor @xmath86 than for the triangular configuration with the same star - star distance .",
    "molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations were performed using exactly the model that three of the present authors devised to test the effective pair potential @xcite and had been originally proposed to study single star polymers @xcite . in this model",
    "the configuration of star polymer @xmath87 is given by the coordinates @xmath88 of the @xmath20 monomers @xmath89 of the @xmath0 chains @xmath90 and the position of its core @xmath91 .",
    "the main features of this model are the following : ( 1 ) a purely repulsive truncated lennard - jones like potential acts between all monomers @xmath92 on all chains .",
    "( 2 ) an attractive fene - potential @xcite that preserves the chain connectivity and acts only between consecutive monomers @xmath93 along each chain . ( 3 ) these potentials have to be slightly modified for the interaction between the first monomer @xmath94 and the core @xmath95 of the star to allow the core to have a radius @xmath96 that is sufficiently large to place @xmath0 monomers in its vicinity .",
    "the three cores of the stars were placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle , see again figure 1 where also the core radius @xmath97 is shown .",
    "a typical snapshot of the three star simulation is displayed in figure 2 for a functionality of @xmath98 and @xmath99 monomers per chain .",
    "the force on the star core was averaged during the md simulation for a number of edge lengths @xmath43 of the triangle varying in the range between the diameter of the two cores @xmath100 and the diameter of gyration @xmath7 of a single star polymer .",
    "we have produced data for @xmath101 .",
    "for the smaller functionalities ( @xmath102 ) the number of monomers per chain was @xmath99 while for @xmath103 a number @xmath104 was chosen .",
    "note that the total system comprises between @xmath105 mutually interacting particles .",
    "as equilibration is slow and the statistical average converges slowly , the simulation becomes increasingly time - consuming beyond such system sizes .",
    "as for reference data , we have also produced data for a two stars situation according to the calculations in ref .   @xcite",
    "results of the computer simulation are compared to the theory in figures 3a and 3b . the reduced averaged force on a single star",
    "is shown versus the reduced triangle length for different arm numbers . as a reference case , also",
    "the corresponding results in a pair potential picture are shown , both within theory and simulation . for technical reasons we kept a small core radius @xmath96 in the simulation , which is roughly @xmath106 of the radius of gyration of the whole star . in the theory ,",
    "on the other hand , the core size was zero .",
    "hence , to compare properly @xcite , a shift @xmath107 has to be performed .",
    "as expected , in both theory and simulation , the triplet forces become relevant only within the coronae .",
    "a comparison with pure pairwise forces leads to the first important observation that the triplet force is smaller , i.e.  the pure triplet contribution is _",
    "attractive_. ( note that one has to multiply the pure two - star force by a factor of @xmath108 for simple geometrical reasons . ) the relative magnitude of the triplet term , however , is small .",
    "a quantitative comparison with theory and simulation leads to good overall agreement .",
    "the triplet contribution itself , however , is subjected to larger statistical errors of the simulation .",
    "hence we resorted to a different strategy to check the theory by plotting the inverse force versus distance .",
    "if the theory is correct the simulation data should fall on a straight line both for the pure pairwise and the full triplet case .",
    "the slope should then give the theoretical prefactor of the logarithmic potential .",
    "the advantage of this consideration is that the slope bears a smaller statistical error as more data points are included .",
    "such a comparison is shown in figure 4 for @xmath109 .",
    "the first consequence is that the simulation data indeed fall on a straight line confirming the theory .",
    "in fact this is true for all other parameter combinations considered in the simulations .",
    "the slope is higher for the triplet and lower for the pair case , both in theory and simulation .",
    "the actual values in figure 4 are in the same order of magnitude but a bit different .    in order to check this in more detail ,",
    "we have extracted the slope for all simulation data .",
    "the result is summarized in figure 5 where the relative differences of the slopes between the pair and triplet cases are plotted versus the arm number @xmath0 .",
    "the theory predicts a constant value of @xmath110 , see eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the simulation data scatter a lot in the range between @xmath111 and @xmath112 due to the large statistical error but the theoretical value falls reasonably within the data .",
    "consequently , the triplet contributions are found to be attractive and small even for nearly touching cores where the triplet overlap of the coronae is substantial .",
    "in conclusion , we have calculated , by theory and computer simulations , the triplet interaction between star polymer centers in a good solvent positioned on the corners of an equilateral triangle .",
    "the triplet part was found to be attractive but only about @xmath85 of the pairwise repulsion .",
    "our calculations justify earlier investigations @xcite where the pair potential framework was used even slightly above the star overlap concentration .",
    "we finish with a couple of remarks : first , the scaling theory can also be performed for any triplet configurations beyond the equilateral triangle studied in this paper .",
    "second , arbitrary higher - order many body forces can be investigated assuming a cluster of @xmath113 stars .",
    "such a calculation is given in appendix a. as a result , the deviations from the pair potential picture increase with the number @xmath113 and even diverge for @xmath114 .",
    "this implies that the pair potential picture breaks down for very high concentrations .",
    "this is expected as for high concentration a star polymer solution is mainly a semi - dilute solution of linear chains where it is irrelevant at which center they are attached to @xcite . as far as further simulational work is concerned , there are many open problems left . apart from the investigation for arbitrary triplet configurations and their extensions to an arbitrary number of stars , the most challenging problem is a full  ab initio \" simulation of many stars including many - body forces from the very beginning .",
    "this is in analogy to car - parrinello simulations @xcite which were also applied to colloidal suspensions @xcite .",
    "a first attempt has been done @xcite , but certainly more work is needed here",
    ". another ( a bit less demanding ) task is to study stars on a periodic solid lattice with periodic boundary conditions and extract the many body interactions from there",
    ".    it would be interesting to study the relevance of triplet forces for star polymers in a _ poor _ solvent near the @xmath115-point @xcite .",
    "it can , however , be expected that the triplet forces here are even less important than for a good solvent as the effective interaction becomes stiffer in a poor solvent .",
    "furthermore , the effect of polydispersity in the arm number which has been briefly touched in our scaling theory treatment should be extended since this is important to describe real experimental samples .",
    "we are grateful to the dfg for financial support within the sfb 237 .",
    "here , we derive for the general case of @xmath113 simultaneously interacting star polymers with @xmath0 arms the effective @xmath113th order force . generalizing the equilateral triangle geometry ,",
    "we study the situation where the @xmath113 cores of the stars are evenly distributed on a sphere with radius @xmath70 .",
    "in particular , the cores of the stars may be located at the corners of a regular polyhedron . then the non - radial forces on each star polymer cancel .",
    "the latter condition may be fulfilled approximately also for large numbers @xmath113 for which a regular polyhedron does not exist .",
    "we first calculate the force on one star by the sum of @xmath116 pairwise forces effected by the other stars . for the pairwise force ( [ 7 ] ) that",
    "acts according to a @xmath117-law it is easy to verify that the radial component of the force between any two points on the sphere is @xmath118 independent of their relative position .",
    "with this simplification the total ( radial ) force on one star is @xmath119 here , @xmath120 denotes the sum of pairwise forces on one of the @xmath113 stars each with @xmath0 arms . in the case",
    "@xmath121 this is the result of eq .",
    "( [ 14 ] ) .",
    "the total @xmath113th order force @xmath122 between @xmath113 star polymers with @xmath0 arms brought close together may again be derived from a short distance expansion resulting in the scaling relation @xmath123 the force on one star is then found in the same way as for three stars as @xmath124 the leading contributions for large numbers of stars @xmath113 in the two cases differ even in the power of @xmath113 . while the first is linear in @xmath113 the latter grows only with the square root of @xmath113 . in the large-@xmath0 and large-@xmath113",
    "approximations this reads : @xmath125 note that for large @xmath113 the factors @xmath113 and @xmath126 in these two approaches are not a result of the large @xmath0 approximation but are of combinatorial and geometrical origin .",
    "this shows that for large @xmath113 the sum of pairwise forces largely overestimates the force on one star .",
