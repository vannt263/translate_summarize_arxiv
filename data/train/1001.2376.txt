    "multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) systems with large number ( e.g. , tens ) of transmit and receive antennas , referred to as ` large - mimo systems , ' are of interest because of the high capacities / spectral efficiencies theoretically predicted in these systems @xcite,@xcite .",
    "research in low - complexity receive processing ( e.g. , mimo detection ) techniques that can lead to practical realization of large - mimo systems is both nascent as well as promising . for e.g. ,",
    "ntt docomo has already field demonstrated a @xmath7 v - blast system operating at 5 gbps data rate and 50 bps / hz spectral efficiency in 5 ghz band at a mobile speed of 10 km / hr @xcite .",
    "evolution of wifi standards ( evolution from ieee 802.11n to ieee 802.11ac to achieve multi - gigabit rate transmissions in 5 ghz band ) now considers @xmath8 mimo operation ; see @xmath8 mimo indoor channel sounding measurements at 5 ghz reported in @xcite for consideration in wifi standards .",
    "also , @xmath9 mimo channel sounding measurements at 5 ghz in indoor environments have been reported in @xcite .",
    "we note that , while rf / antenna technologies / measurements for large - mimo systems are getting matured , there is an increasing need to focus on low - complexity algorithms for detection in large - mimo systems to reap their high spectral efficiency benefits .    in the above context , in our recent works",
    ", we have shown that certain algorithms from machine learning / artificial intelligence achieve near - optimal performance in large - mimo systems at low complexities @xcite-@xcite . in @xcite-@xcite , a local neighborhood search",
    "based algorithm , namely , a _ likelihood ascent search _",
    "( las ) algorithm , was proposed and shown to achieve close to maximum - likelihood ( ml ) performance in mimo systems with several tens of antennas ( e.g. , @xmath4 and @xmath10 mimo ) .",
    "subsequently , in @xcite,@xcite , another local search algorithm , namely , _ reactive tabu search _ ( rts ) algorithm , which performed better than the las algorithm through the use of a local minima exit strategy was presented . in @xcite ,",
    "near - ml performance in a @xmath11 mimo system was demonstrated using a _ gibbs sampling _ based detection algorithm , where the symbols take values from @xmath3 .",
    "more recently , we , in @xcite , proposed a factor graph based _ belief propagation _",
    "( bp ) algorithm for large - mimo detection , where we adopted a gaussian approximation of the interference ( gai ) .",
    "the motivation for the present work arises from the following two observations on the rts and bp algorithms in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite : @xmath0 rts works for general @xmath1-qam . although rts was shown to achieve close to ml performance for 4-qam in large dimensions , significant performance improvement was still possible for higher - order qam ( e.g. , 16- and 64-qam ) .",
    "@xmath2 bp also was shown to achieve near - optimal performance for large dimensions , but only for @xmath3 alphabet . in this paper",
    ", we improve the large - mimo detection performance of higher - order qam signals by using a hybrid algorithm that employs rts and bp . in particular , we observed that when a detection error occurs at the rts output , the least significant bits ( lsb ) of the symbols are mostly in error .",
    "motivated by this observation , we propose to first reconstruct and cancel the interference due to bits other than the lsbs at the rts output and feed the interference cancelled received signal to the bp algorithm to improve the reliability of the lsbs .",
    "the output of the bp is then fed back to the rts for the next iteration .",
    "our simulation results show that the proposed rts - bp algorithm achieves better uncoded as well as coded ber performance compared to those achieved by rts in large - mimo systems with higher - order qam ( e.g. , rts - bp performs better by about 3.5 db at @xmath5 uncoded ber and by about 2.5 db at @xmath6 rate-3/4 turbo coded ber in @xmath4 v - blast with 64-qam ) at the same order of complexity as rts .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the rts and bp algorithms in @xcite,@xcite and @xcite and the motivation for the current work . the proposed hybrid rts - bp algorithm and its performance",

    "conclusions are given in sec .",
    "consider a @xmath12 v - blast mimo system whose received signal vector , @xmath13 , is of the form @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the symbol vector transmitted , @xmath16 is the channel gain matrix , and @xmath17 is the noise vector whose entries are modeled as i.i.d @xmath18 .",
    "assuming rich scattering , we model the entries of @xmath19 as i.i.d @xmath20 .",
    "each element of @xmath21 is an @xmath1-pam or @xmath1-qam symbol .",
    "@xmath1-pam symbols take values from @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , and @xmath1-qam is nothing but two pams in quadrature . as in @xcite , we convert ( [ eqn1 ] ) into a real - valued system model , given by @xmath24    where @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 . for @xmath1-qam , @xmath29 $ ] can viewed to be from an underlying @xmath1-pam signal set , and so is @xmath30 $ ] .",
    "let @xmath31 denote the @xmath1-pam signal set from which @xmath32 takes values , @xmath33 .",
    "defining a @xmath34-dimensional signal space @xmath35 to be the cartesian product of @xmath36 to @xmath37 , the ml solution vector , @xmath38 , is given by @xmath39 whose complexity is exponential in @xmath40 .",
    "the rts algorithm in @xcite,@xcite is a low - complexity algorithm , which minimizes the ml metric in ( [ mldetection ] ) through a local neighborhood search .      a detailed description of the rts algorithm for large - mimo detection is available in @xcite,@xcite .",
    "here , we present a brief summary of the key aspects of the algorithm , and its 16- and 64-qam performance that motivates the current work .    the rts algorithm starts with an initial solution vector , defines a neighborhood around it ( i.e. , defines a set of neighboring vectors based on a neighborhood criteria ) , and moves to the best vector among the neighboring vectors ( even if the best neighboring vector is worse , in terms of likelihood , than the current solution vector ; this allows the algorithm to escape from local minima ) .",
    "this process is continued for a certain number of iterations , after which the algorithm is terminated and the best among the solution vectors in all the iterations is declared as the final solution vector . in defining the neighborhood of the solution vector in a given iteration ,",
    "the algorithm attempts to avoid cycling by making the moves to solution vectors of the past few iterations as ` tabu ' ( i.e. , prohibits these moves ) , which ensures efficient search of the solution space .",
    "the number of these past iterations is parametrized as the ` tabu period . '",
    "the search is referred to as fixed tabu search if the tabu period is kept constant .",
    "if the tabu period is dynamically changed ( e.g. , increase the tabu period if more repetitions of the solution vectors are observed in the search path ) , then the search is called reactive tabu search .",
    "we consider reactive tabu search because of its robustness ( choice of a good fixed tabu period can be tedious ) .",
    "the per - symbol complexity of rts for detection of v - blast signals is @xmath41 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the uncoded ber performance of rts using the algorithm parameters optimized through simulations for 4- , 16- , and 64-qam in a @xmath4 v - blast system . as lower bounds on the error performance in mimo , the siso awgn performance for 4- , 16- , and 64-qam are also plotted .",
    "it can be seen that , in the case of 4-qam , the rts performance is just about 0.5 db away from the siso awgn performance at @xmath5 ber .",
    "however , the gap between rts performance and siso awgn performance at @xmath5 ber widens for 16-qam and 64-qam ; the gap is 7.5 db for 16-qam and 16.5 db for 64-qam .",
    "this gap can be viewed as a potential indicator of the amount of improvement in performance possible further",
    ". a more appropriate indicator will be the gap between rts performance and the ml performance .",
    "since simulation of sphere decoding ( sd ) of @xmath4 v - blast with 16- and 64-qam ( 64 real dimensions ) is computationally intensive , we do not show the sd ( ml ) performance .",
    "nevertheless , the widening gap of rts performance from siso awgn performance for 16- and 64-qam seen in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] motivated us to explore improved algorithms to achieve better performance than rts performance for higher - order qam .",

[ fig2 ] ) . using these llrs , the variable nodes compute the probabilities @xmath56 and pass them back to the observation nodes ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this message passing is carried out for a certain number of iterations . at the end , @xmath52 is detected as @xmath57 it has been shown in @xcite that this bp algorithm with gai , like las and rts algorithms , exhibits ` large - system behavior , ' where the bit error performance improves with increasing number of dimensions .",

    "[ fig1 ] , the uncoded ber performance of this bp algorithm for 4-qam ( input data vector of size @xmath34 with elements from @xmath3 ) in @xmath4 v - blast is also plotted .",
    "we can see that the performance is almost the same as that of rts . in terms of complexity , the bp algorithm has the advantage of no need to compute an initial solution vector and @xmath58 , which is required in rts .",
    "the per - symbol complexity of the bp algorithm for detection in v - blast is @xmath59 .",
    "a limitation with this bp approach is that it is not for general @xmath1-qam .",
    "however , its good performance with @xmath3 alphabet at lower complexities than rts can be exploited to improve the higher - order qam performance of rts , as proposed in the following section .",
    "[ sec3 ] in this section , we highlight the rationale behind the hybrid rts - bp approach and present the proposed algorithm .    _ why hybrid rts - bp ? _",
    "the proposed hybrid rts - bp approach is motivated by the the following observation we made in our rts ber simulations .",
    "we observed that , at moderate to high snrs , when an rts output vector is in error , the least significant bits ( lsb ) of the data symbols are more likely to be in error than other bits .",
    "an analytical reasoning for this behavior can be given as follows .",
    "let @xmath60 be the transmit vector and @xmath61 be the corresponding output of the rts detector .",
    "let @xmath62 denote the @xmath1-pam alphabet that @xmath32 s take values from . consider the symbol - to - bit mapping , where we can write the value of each entry of @xmath61 as a linear combination of its constituent bits as @xmath63 where @xmath64 and @xmath65 .",
    "we note that the rts algorithm outputs a local minima as the solution vector .",
    "so , @xmath66 , being a local minima , satisfies the following conditions : @xmath67 where @xmath68 , and @xmath69 denotes the @xmath53th column of the identity matrix . defining @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and denoting the @xmath53th column of @xmath50 as @xmath72 , the conditions in ( [ localminima ] ) reduce to @xmath73 where @xmath74 denotes the @xmath49th element of @xmath75 . under moderate to high snr conditions , ignoring the noise , ( [ reducedcondition ] ) can be further reduced to @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes the @xmath53th column of * f*. for rayleigh fading , @xmath78 is chi - square distributed with @xmath34 degrees of freedom with mean @xmath40 . approximating the distribution of @xmath74 to be normal with mean zero and variance @xmath79 for @xmath80 by central limit theorem , we can drop the @xmath81 in ( [ finalcondn1 ] ) . using the fact that the minimum value of @xmath82 is 2 , ( [ finalcondn1 ] )",
    "can be simplified as @xmath83 where @xmath84 .",
    "also , if @xmath85 , by the normal approximation in the above @xmath86 now , the lhs in ( [ finalcondn2 ] ) being normal with variance proportional to @xmath87 and the rhs being positive , it can be seen that @xmath88 , @xmath89 take smaller values with higher probability . hence , the symbols of @xmath90 are nearest euclidean neighbors of their corresponding symbols of the global minima with high probability s and @xmath91 s take values from @xmath1-pam alphabet , @xmath91 is said to be the euclidean nearest neighbor of @xmath32 if @xmath92 . ] .",
    "now , because of the symbol - to - bit mapping in ( [ linearcomb ] ) , @xmath91 will differ from its nearest euclidean neighbors certainly in the lsb position , and may or may not differ in other bit positions .",
    "consequently , the lsbs of the symbols in the rts output @xmath61 are least reliable .",
    "the above observation then led us to consider improving the reliability of the lsbs of the rts output using the bp algorithm in @xcite , and iterate between rts and bp as follows .",

    "now , using @xmath101 from the bp output , and the @xmath102 , @xmath103 from the rts output in step 1 , reconstruct the symbol vector as @xmath104 * _ step 4 : _ repeat steps 1 to 3 using @xmath105 as the initial vector to the rts algorithm .",
    "the algorithm is stopped after a certain number of iterations between rts and bp .",
    "our simulations showed that two iterations between rts and bp are adequate to achieve good improvement ; more than two iterations resulted in only marginal improvement for the system parameters considered in the simulations .",
    "since the complexity of bp part of rts - bp is less than that of the rts part , the order of complexity of rts - bp is same as that of rts .",
