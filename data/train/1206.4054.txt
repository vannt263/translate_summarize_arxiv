    "the dissipation mechanism responsible for the prompt emission of gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) remains unknown .",
    "there have been various ideas put forth to explain it ( for a review , see piran 1999 , 2004 ; mszros 2006 ; gehrels et al . 2009 ) .",
    "one of the main problems is to explain the fact that the majority of grbs exhibit a spectrum @xmath7 , with @xmath8 below the peak of the spectrum ( preece et al . 2000 ) , whereas the simplest version of the synchrotron model ( in the so - called `` fast cooling regime '' ) predicts @xmath9 ( see , e.g. , ghisellini et al .",
    "recently , a modified version of the synchrotron model , in which electrons that radiate below the peak of the spectrum cool via inverse compton ( ic ) in the klein - nishina ( kn ) regime ( derishev et al .",
    "2003 ) has gained popularity ( bonjak et al . 2009 , nakar et al . 2009 , wang et al .",
    "2009 , fan 2010 , daigne et al .",
    "the main idea is very simple : electrons cooling via synchrotron mechanism ( or ic in the thomson regime ) exhibit an energy loss rate @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the electron lorentz factor ( lf ) and @xmath12 .",
    "the observed synchrotron spectrum is then @xmath13 .",
    "however , when the cooling of electrons is dominated by the ic in the kn regime , where the photon - electron interaction cross section scales as @xmath14 , then @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in this paper , we investigate this scenario in detail and explore its consequences .",
    "we analytically study the ic cooling in the kn regime assuming that electrons are injected continuously over a time scale comparable to the dynamical time scale , as is expected for the internal shock model of grbs ( piran , shemi & narayan 1993 ; katz 1994 ; rees & mszros 1994 ) .",
    "recently , daigne et al . (",
    "2011 ) have provided a detailed numerical calculation of the same context ; however , they have assumed that electrons are injected instantaneously in the internal shock .",
    "therefore , our work and the work of daigne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) are complementary .",
    "essentially , daigne et al . (",
    "2011 ) deals with the case when electrons are no longer being injected and they simply cool , which happens when the internal shock has already passed through the shell .",
    "they consider the superposition of emission of many shells , for which the shock has crossed all of them , and the shells simply adiabatically expand and cool .",
    "we , however , consider the shock as it traverses the shell , accelerates electrons , and these radiate .",
    "the scenario presented in this paper has been considered before ( nakar et al .",
    "2009 ; fan 2010 ) and our results are consistent .",
    "however , in contrast with these works and with the work of daigne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , the work presented here is applied to the prompt phase data of particular grbs with @xmath17 : we analyze the data of grb 080916c , a burst detected by the _",
    "fermi _ satellite , in the context of the scenario described above , and provide constraints on this scenario based on available @xmath18100 mev data .",
    "recent developments on prompt grb theory have cast doubt on the internal shock model ( see , e.g. , kumar & narayan 2009 , zou et al .",
    "new alternative models have been proposed to solve the low - energy spectral index problem described above and other prompt theory issues ( see , e.g. , mszros & rees 2000 , drenkhahn & spruit 2002 ; lyutikov & blandford 2003 ; giannios 2008 ; narayan & kumar 2009 ; kumar & narayan 2009 ; lazar et al .",

    "2011 ; zhang & yan 2011 , bonjak & kumar 2012 ; peer et al .",
    "it is , however , still relevant to critically test the internal shock model , in the particular case where electrons cool via ic in the kn regime , to assess its feasibility .",
    "it is important to mention that there exists a fraction of grbs with @xmath19 ( only about 25 per cent of grbs have more than 50 per cent of their spectra with @xmath20 in this range ; see kaneko et al .",
    "2006 ) , that is , with spectra consistent with synchrotron radiation mechanism ; however the scenario presented here is unable to explain them . in this work",
    "we focus on the _ majority _ of grbs , which have @xmath17 ; in particular , we study the case of grb 080916c , which shows @xmath21 for most of its duration ( abdo et al . 2009 ) .",
    "we set up our model and present the relevant time scales in section 2 . in sections 3 and 4 ,",
    "we calculate the effect of ic cooling in the kn regime on the electron energy distribution and on the observed spectral slope , respectively . in section 5",
    "we derive the relevant physical parameters ( radius of emission and total luminosity ) . in section 6",
    "we apply our results to grb080916c , and to an average long - duration grb . in sections 7 and 8",
    ", we present a discussion and our conclusions .",
    "let us consider a grb jet that has bulk lf @xmath22 and bolometric @xmath23-ray luminosity ( isotropic equivalent ) @xmath24 .",
    "the peak of the grb spectrum ( @xmath25 ) in observer frame is @xmath26 .",
    "we define    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the redshift and @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are planck s constant , the electron mass and the speed of light , respectively .",
    "the case we are trying to explain using the idea of electron cooling via ic cooling in the kn regime is when the observed spectrum below the peak is @xmath7 , with @xmath8 ; @xmath20 is known as the low energy spectral index .",
    "we take @xmath20 to extend from at least 10 kev to @xmath26 ; 10 kev is roughly the lower energy limit of the gbm detector on board the _ fermi _ satellite .",
    "let us take the thermal lf of electrons that produce 10 kev photons ( via synchrotron process ) to be @xmath32 , and the lf of electrons producing photons of frequency @xmath26 to be @xmath33 .",
    "we start with the assumption that electrons with lf @xmath34 cool primarily via ic in the kn regime . in order to satisfy this assumption",
    ", @xmath32 should be such that    @xmath35    which leads to the condition that @xmath36 .",
    "we define a variable @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) which tells us how deep electrons of @xmath32 are in the kn regime . with this ,",
    "@xmath32 is    @xmath39    we can find the magnetic field strength in the jet comoving frame , @xmath40 , so that electrons with lf @xmath32 have synchrotron radiation at 10 kev in the observer frame . the observed synchrotron frequency of electrons of @xmath32 is    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the electron charge . for @xmath43 kev , and using ( [ gamma_4 ] ) , we find the magnetic field    @xmath44    where here and throughout the paper we use the usual notation @xmath45 , with the exception of @xmath11 , @xmath46 and the compton-@xmath47 parameter , @xmath47 ; in these cases the subscript indicates the log@xmath48 of the observed synchrotron frequency in ev we are referring to .    the cooling time due to synchrotron radiation for an electron of lf @xmath11 , in the jet comoving frame , is given by    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is the thomson cross section .",
    "for @xmath51 we find , using ( [ gamma_4 ] ) and ( [ b_field ] ) , that    @xmath52    we now calculate the electron cooling time due to ic scattering of @xmath23-ray photons .",
    "the cross section for scattering photons of frequency @xmath26 by electrons of @xmath32 is smaller than the thomson cross section by a factor of @xmath53 .",
    "thus ,    @xmath54    or by substituting ( [ gamma_4 ] ) , we find    @xmath55    note that the ic cooling time is essentially independent of @xmath11 in the kn regime .",

    "@xmath37 parameter space is that the cooling time scale for electrons radiating at 10 kev can not be larger than the dynamical time scale .",
    "after all , we need electrons to cool rapidly via ic scatterings in the kn regime to obtain @xmath17 .",
    "this constraint can be obtained in the following way .",
    "the electron cooling time in the jet comoving frame for electrons of lf @xmath32 is given by @xmath129 .",
    "we use ( [ t_syn ] ) and ( [ ic_kn ] ) to determine @xmath130 .",

    "this radius is a function of the total blast wave energy , @xmath136 , the circum - stellar density , @xmath137 , which we assume is a constant , and the bulk lf ( see , e.g. , sari , piran & narayan 1998 )    @xmath138    the true upper limit will be given by the minimum of @xmath132 and @xmath135 .",

    "however , we can also ask : what is @xmath20 for a reasonable set of parameters ? in this case , `` reasonable '' means two things : ( 1 ) the radius of emission of the prompt emission should be between ( i ) the photospheric radius and ( ii ) the radius where electrons producing 10 kev synchrotron photons cool on a time scale shorter than the dynamical time via ic scatterings in the kn regime , or the deceleration radius , whichever is smaller , and ( 2 ) the energy in the ic component should not be very large , so that the grb spectrum does not show an ic bump at @xmath141 gev , as the _ fermi _ satellite sees no sign for such an excess .",
    "we have calculated the maximum value of @xmath20 that can be obtained for a highly energetic fermi burst , grb080916c , and also for an average grb and the results are presented in table [ table1 ] .",
    "we find that the maximum value of @xmath20 is @xmath210 .",
    "for this value , the same consequences as discussed above apply , and can be found in table [ table1 ] .",
    "namely , that @xmath211 , and this implies a very large value of @xmath33 and an extremely small value of @xmath178",
    ". moreover , the maximum value of @xmath20 occurs at a very large radius , close to the deceleration radius , which , will have problems producing variable light curves with @xmath212 smaller than a few seconds .",
    "conversely , we can also fix the observed variability time scale of the gamma - ray light curve to be @xmath213 s and determine the radius of emission with ( [ r_is ] ) , as expected in the internal shock model .",
    "we can determine the maximum value of @xmath20 at this radius and its value is presented in parenthesis in table [ table1 ] .",
    "notice that this value of @xmath20 is even further away from the observed value .",
    "however , at this radius , the values of @xmath214 and @xmath215 are less extreme and in marginal agreement with the internal shock model .",
    "nevertheless , this further accentuates the fact that synchrotron emission , in which electrons cool mainly via ic in the kn regime , in the context of the internal shock model , can not explain the observed @xmath8 spectrum of most grbs .    expressing our analytical results as a function of @xmath186 allows us to compare them with previous numerical work .",
    "nakar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) ( see , also , fan 2010 ) have found numerically that with @xmath216 ( @xmath217 ) , @xmath20 can not exceed @xmath218 ( @xmath219 ) . in this work ,",
    "we analytically confirm their results ( see right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "daigne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) have also found numerically that @xmath171 is possible in the case when electrons are injected instantaneously . however , in nakar et al .",
    "( 2009 ) and the present work , we have assumed that electrons are injected regularly over a time scale comparable to the dynamical time scale",
    ". nevertheless , daigne et al . (",
    "2011 ) present numerical results for our scenario in their fig .",
    "2 ( bottom left panel ) for @xmath220 , which agree with our analytical calculation .    our work and the work by daigne et al . ( 2011 ) , as mentioned before , differ mainly on the chosen time scale at which electrons are injected to the shock , @xmath221 .",
    "we take @xmath222 , where @xmath80 is the dynamical time scale , whereas daigne et al .",
    "take @xmath223 .",
    "we find a stricter limit on the allowed value of @xmath20 : @xmath224 , whereas daigne et al .",
    "find that solutions with @xmath171 can be reached ( see their fig .",
    "2 ) . these results are not in contradiction , since both studies probe two different phases found in the internal shock model .",
    "the first phase ( @xmath222 ) has electrons continuously being injected to the shock as it crosses the shell .",
    "the second phase ( @xmath223 ) corresponds to the case where the shock has already traversed the shell and electrons cool as the shell adiabatically expands .",
    "most of the available energy is dissipated in the first phase ; for this reason we have chosen this particular scenario in this paper , which is the common practice in studies of the internal shock model ( see , e.g. , piran 1999 ) .    however , when calculating synthetic grb light curves , daigne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) do follow the dynamics of the shock crossing numerically , and consider a large number of discretized shells on the dynamical time scale . in each collision",
    "the electron injection occurs instantaneously , @xmath223 , but the electron injection process over the full simulation is comparable to the dynamical timescale . in this case , when including ic cooling in the kn regime ( see their fig .",
    "9 ) , they find @xmath225 .",
    "the difference in our results appears because the ic scatterings in their work do not occur between the same photon and electron distributions we have considered : in daigne et al .",
    "( 2011 ) the scatterings between photons emitted in a shocked region and electrons or photons present in a subsequent shocked region were not considered ( see bonjak et al . 2009 ) .",
    "this affects the cooling of the electrons via ic , allowing them to reach spectra closer to @xmath171 .",
    "in this work we have investigated the possibility that the observed low energy grb prompt spectrum , which is @xmath226 ( below the peak ) for a good fraction of all long duration grbs ( preece et al . 2000 ; kaneko et al .",
    "2006 ; plangeon et al .",
    "2008 ; krimm et al .",
    "2009 ; ghirlanda et al .",
    "2010 ) , is due to synchrotron radiation from electrons that cool mainly via the ic mechanism in the kn regime ( derishev et al .",
    "2003 , bonjak et al .",
    "2009 , nakar et al .",
    "2009 , wang et al .",
    "2009 , fan 2010 , daigne et al . 2011 ) .",
    "we present an analytical method to determine the power - law index of the electron energy distribution function , @xmath94 , that cools via ic cooling in the kn regime as a function of two parameters : @xmath46 , which is a measure of how deep electrons of interest are in the kn regime , and @xmath91 , which is the compton-@xmath47 parameter ( including kn corrections ) for these electrons .",
    "we have calculated the observed low energy spectral index for synchrotron radiation , @xmath20 , as a function of these two parameters as well as the power - law index of the electron energy distribution above @xmath33 ( @xmath33 corresponds to the lf of electrons radiating at the peak ) .",
    "we find that @xmath20 is not simply given by @xmath202 as naively expected , but it is smaller , which makes it very difficult to explain the observed value of @xmath227 for a good fraction of grbs .",
    "we find that @xmath0 can not be obtained for parameters relevant for grbs , if the radiation mechanism is the synchrotron process and electrons are accelerated in a relativistic shock , where electrons are only accelerated when they cross the shock front and are scattered back to the other side .",
    "therefore , the @xmath23-ray radiation from a significant fraction of long duration grbs that have low energy spectral index larger than @xmath174 can not be accounted for by this mechanism .",
    "even @xmath228 faces severe difficulties .",
    "the large radius for generation of @xmath23-rays is in conflict with the short variability time ( @xmath229 0.1 s ) of prompt grb light curve .",
    "moreover , the energy in the magnetic field must be extremely small , @xmath230 , and @xmath180 for the mechanism to be able to able to harden the spectral slope from @xmath231 to @xmath232 ( table 1 ) .",
    "it is unlikely that the energy fraction in the magnetic field will be so small ( @xmath233 ) in internal shocks .",
    "if the central engine of grbs is powered by accretion onto a black hole , we expect @xmath234% as magnetic fields of such a strength are likely produced in the accretion disk by the balbus - hawley mechanism ( hawley , gammie & balbus 1996 ) ; for a magnetar based central engine this small @xmath178 is even more surprising .",
    "for the typical thermal lf of electrons to be large , @xmath235 , in internal shocks where shells collide with a relative lf of a few to 10 , it is required that approximately only 1 in @xmath236 electrons are accelerated when they cross the shock - front but they receive @xmath201% of the total energy .",
    "this is in contradiction with the numerical pic simulations of sironi & spitkovsky ( 2011 ) .",
    "moreover , the @xmath237% of electrons which are not accelerated have a thermal lf of a few thousand due to their interaction with protons ( sironi & spitkovsky 2011 ) , and these electrons produce a significant ic bump in the spectrum at @xmath200 100 mev which is not seen for any bursts .",
    "the ssc flux of these electrons at 100 mev will be very large : about a factor of 10 larger than the observed flux .",
    "all these difficulties suggest that the synchrotron radiation mechanism in internal shocks does not provide a self - consistent solution when the low - energy spectral index for grbs is larger than about @xmath219 .",
