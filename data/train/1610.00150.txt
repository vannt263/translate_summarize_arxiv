    "the discovery of the higgs boson at the lhc  @xcite has by now firmly established the existence of a scalar particle as a fundamental ingredient of the spontaneous symmetry breaking ( ssb ) mechanism for electroweak theory  @xcite .    on the other end",
    ", further investigation is required in order to understand the properties of the ssb potential .",
    "in addition to the standard model ( sm ) quartic higgs potential , many other possibilities can be considered . the model - independent approach based on the effective field theory ( eft ) technique allows to disentangle the phenomenological consequences of higher dimensional operators  @xcite .",
    "prospects of measuring anomalous higgs couplings at the lhc and at future colliders have been considered e.g. in  @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we discuss the field - theoretical properties of an equivalent physical formulation of the ssb potential based on higher derivatives interactions  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of this formulation is that the mass of the physical higgs excitation only enters in the mass term of the physical field and not in the coupling constant ( unlike in the ordinary quartic sm potential ) .",
    "this has a number of consequences .",
    "the functional equations governing the theory include the equation of motion for the physical massive mode .",
    "let us denote it by @xmath2 .",
    "in addition to the quadratic mass term , one can include in the action a kinetic term for @xmath2 @xmath3 once such a term is introduced into the classical action , the equation of motion for @xmath2 is modified by a contribution linear in @xmath2 and still survives quantization ( due to the fact that the breaking is linear in the quantized fields ) . on the other hand , power - counting renormalizability is lost , since new divergences arise , vanishing at @xmath4 .",
    "this remark leads to a perturbative definition of the non power - counting renormalizable theory as a series expansion around @xmath4 , i.e. the coefficients of the expansion in @xmath5 of the amplitudes are fixed in terms of amplitudes of the renormalizable theory at @xmath4 .",
    "a simple and natural prescription for the evaluation of the uv divergences at @xmath6 can be formulated through a rescaling of the @xmath2-lines and an associated mass redefinition in each diagram at @xmath4 .",
    "this prescription selects uniquely the @xmath5-dependent finite counterterms that one can freely add order by order in the loop expansion , leaving only those allowed in the theory at @xmath4 .    by going on - shell with @xmath2",
    "we obtain the linear @xmath0 model with a quartic higgs potential plus the dimension six operator @xmath7 .    in this model the mass of the physical scalar particle is given by @xmath8 .",
    "the limit where the mass scale of the theory @xmath9 goes to infinity while keeping @xmath10 fixed coincides with the strongly interacting regime @xmath11 .    in the prescription for the finite parts of the @xmath5-dependent counterterms outlined before",
    ", one gets back the amplitudes of the nonlinear @xmath0 model in the formulation described in  @xcite .",
    "it should be noticed that , due to the fact that @xmath2 is a su(2 ) singlet , the functional symmetries of the theory are still preserved if one considers a more general uv - regularised propagator of the @xmath2 field .",
    "such a modified propagator is supposed to encode information about a possible uv completion of the theory at a much higher scale @xmath12 .",
    "remarkably enough , one can choose a symmetric ( i.e. fulfilling all functional identities of the theory ) deformation of the @xmath2-propagator in such a way that power - counting renormalizability is preserved also at @xmath13 , at the price of introducing at the tree - level a non - local two point 1-pi function for @xmath2 .",

    "the most general tree - level potential compatible with su(2 ) symmetry and of dimension @xmath183 is @xmath184 going on - shell with @xmath21 one again finds @xmath185 and upon substitution in eq.([potential.hsm ] ) we obtain the standard formulation of the hsm potential .",
    "the coefficient of the quartic term @xmath186 is @xmath187 .",
    "imposing linearity of the @xmath2-equation yields the constraint @xmath188 provided that @xmath189 , positivity of @xmath190 and eq.([mixed.constr ] ) ensures the fulfillment of the vacuum stability condition , namely @xmath191  @xcite .",
    "the linear @xmath0 model can be formulated in such a way that the mass of the physical scalar particle only appears in the quadratic part of the action by introducing suitable derivative interactions .",
    "power - counting renormalizability is satisfied .",
    "the amplitudes involving a scalar field @xmath2 are determined by a functional identity implementing at the quantum level the equation of motion for @xmath2 .",
    "this identity admits a unique deformation ( if only local monomials in the fields and their derivatives of dimension @xmath183 are allowed in the action ) , given by a kinetic term for @xmath2 with coefficient @xmath5 .",
    "once such a kinetic term is introduced into the classical action , power - counting renormalizability is lost .",
    "violation of power - counting renormalizability is controlled by the parameter @xmath5 . at @xmath4",
    "we recover the original power - counting renormalizable model .",
    "the amplitudes of the full theory can be expanded as a power series in @xmath5 with coefficients given by diagrams of the original theory at @xmath4 .",
    "each order in @xmath5 is associated to an additional zero - momentum insertion of the kinetic operator .",
    "the theory at @xmath13 comes with a natural prescription for the evaluation of its amplitudes : the latter are given by diagrams in the @xmath4 theory suitably rescaled by factors of @xmath192 according to the number of @xmath2-lines of each diagrams , modulo a redefinition of the mass of the @xmath2-field . at fixed physical mass of the scalar particle",
    ", the dependence on @xmath192 only happens through the overall rescaling of the single diagrams .",
    "the requirement that such a prescription is not spoiled by finite renormalizations yields a consistent choice of the finite counterterms order by order in the loop expansion to all orders in @xmath5 .",
    "the model studied in this paper provides an example of a non power - counting renormalizable model defined as a series expansion in @xmath5 with coefficients evaluated in the power - counting renormalizable theory at @xmath4 .",
    "moreover it yields an example of a theory where the large mass scale regime @xmath193 at fixed mass of the physical scalar particle is achieved as the limit @xmath11 and admits a very simple diagrammatic interpretation .",
    "the limit @xmath193 is a strongly interacting regime associated with the nonlinear @xmath0-model in the formalism introduced in  @xcite .",
    "finally it turns out that , as a consequence of the fact that @xmath2 is a su(2 ) singlet , one might consider symmetric non - local deformations of the two - point 1-pi function for @xmath2 , as a way of describing the effects of would - be new physics at a much higher scale @xmath15 .",
    "these deformations can be chosen ( non - uniquely ) in such a way to restore power - counting renormalizability at @xmath6 without spoiling the defining functional identities of the theory .",
    "it is remarkable fact that such effects of physics at a higher scale can be encoded via a modification only affecting the two - point sector , without altering the derivative interaction .",
