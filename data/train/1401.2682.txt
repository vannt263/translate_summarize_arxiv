    "first , the @xmath78 limit can not be taken without simultaneously letting @xmath108 .",
    "intuitively , this is because as @xmath78 , the gaussian approximation to the poisson distribution with mean @xmath235 breaks down unless the parameter @xmath236 simultaneously diverges to infinity .",
    "second , the derivation gives no quantitative information about the distance between the dcle and the original delay birth - death ( dbd ) process .    in this paper , we address these shortcomings .",
    "we prove rigorously that the dbd process can be approximated by a class of gaussian processes that includes the dcle .",
    "in particular , we establish that for most biophysically relevant propensity functions , the dcle process will approximate all moments of the dbd process .",
    "the rigorous proof includes bounds on the quality of the approximation in terms of the time @xmath85 for which the approximation is desired to hold and the characteristic protein number @xmath58 ( see theorem [ thm : tube ] ) .",
    "the error bounds also indicate that the quality of the dcle approximation worsens with increasing upper bounds on the reaction propensity functions and state - change vectors .",
    "physically , this means that high reaction rates and reactions that cause large changes in the protein populations are detrimental to the quality of the dcle approximation .",
    "the dcle is one of many gaussian processes that approximate the dbd process . among all gaussian approximations with noise components that scale as @xmath237 ,",
    "the dcle is optimal because it is the only such approximation that exactly matches the first and second moments of the dbd process .",
    "we formally justify this assertion in the supplement  @xcite using characteristic functions .",
    "as our simulations of the degrade and fire oscillator demonstrate , the dcle can significantly outperform other gaussian approximations at moderate system sizes .",
    "nevertheless , the quantitative tube estimates in theorem  [ thm : tube ] apply to _ any _ gaussian approximation of the dbd process provided the noise scales as @xmath237 .",
    "this is significant because it is often advantageous to use linear noise approximations of the dcle .",
    "delay appears in the drift component of a linear noise approximation but not in the diffusion component .",
    "linear noise approximations are therefore easier to analyze than their dcle counterparts . in particular ,",
    "elements of the theory of large deviations for markovian systems can be extended to sdes with delay in the drift  @xcite .    for metastable systems ,",
    "our simulations indicate that the dcle captures both temporal information ( such as hitting times for the positive feedback model ; see fig .",

    "<S> delay is an important and ubiquitous aspect of many biochemical processes . for example </S>",

    "<S> we prove that the distance between these two descriptions , as measured by expectations of functionals of the processes , converges to zero with increasing system size . </S>",
    "<S> further , we prove that the delay birth - death process converges to the thermodynamic limit as system size tends to infinity . </S>",
    "<S> our results hold for both fixed delay and distributed delay . </S>",
    "<S> simulations demonstrate that the delay chemical langevin approximation is accurate even at moderate system sizes . </S>",
