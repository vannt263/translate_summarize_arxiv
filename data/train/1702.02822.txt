    "this algebraic approach allows us to study various kinds of recognizable languages where the notion of homomorphism between algebras is a key ingredient .",
    "the study of algebras and classes of algebras is a main subject of study in universal algebra . a well  known theorem in this area is birkhoff s variety theorem @xcite , which states that a class of algebras of a given type is defined by a set of equations if and",

    "later , a birkhoff s theorem for finite algebras was also obtained @xcite , also known as reiterman s theorem . in birkhoff s theorem for finite algebras the kind of equations are of a more general kind , they can be defined by using topological techniques or can be equivalently defined by using the so  called implicit operations . in this case , the classes of algebras considered are pseudovarieties of algebras , also known as varieties of finite algebras , which are defined as classes of finite algebras of the same type that are closed under homomorphic images , subalgebras and finite products .    to state eilenberg ",
    "type theorems , which establish one  to  one correspondences between ( pseudo)varieties of algebras and ( pseudo)varieties of languages , one has to define and find the corresponding notion of a ( pseudo)variety of languages which is , in general , a non  trivial problem .",
    "there are eilenberg  type correspondences in the literature such as , e.g. , @xcite for pseudovarieties of ordered monoids and ordered semigroups , the one in @xcite for pseudovarieties of finite dimensional @xmath7algebras , @xcite for pseudovarieties of idempotent semirings and ( * ? ? ?",

    "the work in the present paper has its basis in @xcite .",
    "we take the main idea given in @xcite , where algebras for a monad @xmath1 on @xmath2 are considered , to define the natural notion of a ( pseudo)variety of @xmath1algebras . in order to characterize the kind of equations defining a ( pseudo)variety of @xmath1algebras",
    ", we use the natural approach of capturing equations as epimorphisms in @xmath2 , i.e. , congruences , and add the condition that those equations are closed under substitution .",
    "these properties are captured in categorical terms to define the notion of a ( pseudo)equational @xmath1theory .",

    "we will show how this concept of ( pseudo)coequational @xmath4theories coincides with the different notions of `` varieties of languages '' in eilenberg  type correspondences , which bring us to our slogan , eilenberg  type correspondences = birkhoff s theorem for ( finite ) algebras + duality . as a consequence , we can summarize eilenberg ",

    "it is worth mentioning that eilenberg ",
    "type correspondences have not been fully understood for the last forty years , which can be witnessed by the numerous published results on the subject that deal with specific kinds of algebras such as @xcite and categorical generalizations such as @xcite in which the direct relation between `` varieties of languages '' and equational theories , by using duality , is not studied or explored to find and justify the defining properties of a `` variety of languages '' .    * related work .",

    "* proposition 4 ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the proof presented here for birkhoff s theorem for finite @xmath1algebras does not involve the use of topology nor profinite techniques , in contrast to @xcite .",
    "related work such as @xcite have influenced and motivated the use of duality in language theory to characterize recognizable languages and to derive local versions of eilenberg  type correspondences . in the present paper ,",
    "the use of duality is a key aspect that helps us to understand and unveil eilenberg ",
    "type correspondences .",
    "there are some works in which categorical approaches to derive eilenberg ",
    "type correspondences are used , notably @xcite .",

    "* theorem 34s ) for pseudovarieties of semigroups can not be derived from @xcite . a different approach to get a general eilenberg ",
    "type theorem is the approach given in @xcite were the algebras considered are algebras for a monad @xmath1 on @xmath10 , for a fixed set @xmath11 . the fact that all the monads considered are on @xmath10 was not general enough to cover cases such as @xcite in which the varieties of languages are not necessarily boolean algebras .",
    "the approach in @xcite of considering algebras for a monad @xmath1 is also considered and generalized in @xcite as well as in the present paper .",
    "one of the main challenges in categorical approaches to eilenberg  type correspondences is to define the right concept of a `` variety of languages '' .",
    "the definition of a `` variety of languages '' given in @xcite depends of finding what they call a `` unary representation '' , which is a set of unary operations on a free algebra satisfying certain properties , see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 3.7 . ) . from this `` unary representation ''",
    "one can construct syntactic algebras and define the kind derivatives that define a `` variety of languages '' .",
    "the definition of a `` variety of languages '' in the present paper is a categorical one which avoids the explicit definition of derivatives and existence of syntactic algebras . in the present paper , derivatives",
    "are captured coalgebraically and syntactic algebras are not used to prove the abstract eilenberg  type correspondences theorems , but both of those concepts can be easily obtained via duality in each concrete case .",
    "coalgebraic approaches , from which one can easily define the concept of a `` variety of languages '' , are not used in @xcite .",
    "another important related work is @xcite , in which an eilenberg  type correspondence for varieties of monoids is shown , which is an eilenberg  type correspondence that can be derived from the present paper but not from @xcite . the work made in @xcite motivates the study of eilenberg  type correspondences for other classes of algebras different than pseudovarieties .",
    "it is worth mentioning that in @xcite the duality between equations and coequations is studied for the first time in the context of an eilenberg  type correspondence .",
    "all in all , the contributions of the present paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
