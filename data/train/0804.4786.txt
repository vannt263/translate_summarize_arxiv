    "proposed by skyrme as a fundamental theory of strong interactions , the skyrme@xcite model was later shown by witten@xcite to be a low energy limit of qcd in the limit of large colour number . in that context , the classical solutions of the skyrme model correspond to bound states of qcd .",
    "the simplest solution , with baryon number 1 , can be computed analytically up to solving an ordinary differential equation numerically . for larger baryon numbers",
    ", one must compute the solutions by solving the full classical equation of the model numerically@xcite .",
    "recently , houghton et al.@xcite showed that the solution of the skyrme model can be well approximated by the so called rational map ansatz . in this ansatz solutions",
    "are approximated by a radial profile function and a rational map ansatz which only depends on the polar angles variables .",
    "one then determines the radial profile by solving an ordinary differential equation while the rational map minimises an integral defined on the sphere .",
    "the configurations obtained by the ansatz fit the numerical solutions very well .",
    "once a classical solution has been obtained , one must still quantise some of the remaining degree of freedom .",
    "one way to do this is to compute the vibration modes of these solutions .",
    "this was done for the numerical solutions of the model by barnes et al.@xcite@xcite for baryon numbers @xmath1 and @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we compute the vibrational mode of the rational map configuration and compare them to those obtained numerically .",
    "the skyrme model@xcite is defined by the following lagrangian @xmath4 ^ 2)\\nonumber\\\\ & & + \\frac{f_{\\pi}^2\\,m_{\\pi}^2}{8p^2}\\,tr(u^p-\\mathbf{1})\\bigg\\}\\,d^3x\\ ; , \\label{dimlag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is an @xmath6 chiral field , @xmath7 is the pion decay constant , @xmath8 is the pion mass and @xmath9 a parameter of the model which is determined by fitting the classical solutions to experimental data .",
    "notice that the last term in ( [ dimlag ] ) is the so called mass term where we have used the generalised mass term proposed by kopeliovich et al.@xcite where the parameter @xmath10 is a positive integer .    rather than using ( [ dimlag ] ) ,",
    "it is convenient to rescale the space - time coordinates and the mass parameter , @xmath11 and use the dimensionless lagrangian @xmath12\\big[r^{\\mu},r^{\\nu}\\big]\\big ) + \\frac{m^2}{p^2}tr\\big(u^p-\\mathbf{1}\\big)\\bigg\\}\\,d^3x\\ ; , \\label{lag}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 .    to approximate the solution by the rational map ansatz",
    ", we first introduce the complex coordinate @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the polar angles .",
    "then the rational map ansatz is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the pauli matrices and @xmath19 the degree of the rational map @xmath20 corresponds to the baryon number of the configuration ( see @xcite ) .",
    "to approximate the classical solution of a given baryon number b , one would thus take @xmath21 and insert the ansatz ( [ rmansatz ] ) into the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) .",
    "one must first determine the parameters @xmath22 and @xmath23 which minimises the integral @xmath24 knowing the value of @xmath25 , one then uses the euler - lagrange equation to derive the equation that the profile @xmath26 must solve . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that the case @xmath0 is nothing but the hedgehog solution computed by skyrme . for @xmath1 ,",
    "the configuration is axially symmetric while for @xmath2 it has the symmetry of a cube .",
    "to study the vibration modes of the rational map ansatz configurations minimising ( [ lag ] ) , we add a time dependant perturbation to the rational map and the profile function around their minimising values .",
    "we then insert the perturbed ansatz into the lagrangian ( [ lag ] ) and compute the euler - lagrange equation for the perturbation , keeping only the linear terms .    denoting @xmath27 the minimising profile function for the static solution , we take @xmath28 where @xmath29 is assumed to be a small fluctuation around @xmath30 satisfying the boundary condition @xmath31 .    to perturb a rational map",
    ", we must perturb all its coefficients , even the one that are null , by adding a small time dependant perturbation .",
    "@xmath32 where @xmath33 notice that , as @xmath34 is a ratio of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the coefficients of the rational map are determined up to an overall constant . if @xmath37 is non zero , we can divide both @xmath35 and @xmath36 by @xmath38 to linear order and @xmath39 then can be incorporated into the other @xmath40 and @xmath41 ; ( if @xmath37 is null , one divides @xmath35 and @xmath36 by @xmath42 ) .",
    "the rational map perturbations are thus described by @xmath43 parameters .",
    "when inserting ( [ pertrm ] ) into ( [ lag ] ) , the perturbed rational map only occurs in the integral ( [ i ] ) and in the two expressions @xmath44 defining @xmath45 we have @xmath46\\;2i\\,d\\xi\\,\\bar{d\\xi}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{x}&=&\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int\\frac{|\\lambda_1|^2}{\\alpha_0 ^ 2}\\frac{2i\\ ,   d\\xi\\,\\bar{d\\xi}}{(1+|\\xi|^2)^2}\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ \\mathcal{y}&=&\\frac{1}{4\\pi}\\int     \\frac{|\\beta_0|^2|\\lambda_1|^2}{\\alpha_0 ^ 4}\\;2i\\,d\\xi\\,\\bar{d\\xi}\\ ; , \\label{ixy}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] notice that the integrals ( [ i ] ) and ( [ ixy ] ) are at most quadratic in the parameters @xmath47 and @xmath48 . to rewrite these integrals in matrix form",
    ", we define @xmath49 and rewrite ( [ ixy ] ) as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the value of @xmath25 for the unperturbed rational map as given in @xcite .",
    "notice that there is no linear term in @xmath52 .",
    "this is because the unperturbed rational map minimises ( [ i ] ) and ( [ xyint ] ) .    inserting the perturbed ansatz ( [ pertf ] ) and ( [ pertrm ] ) into ( [ lag ] ) , we get    @xmath53    where @xmath54\\bigg\\}\\,dr\\;,\\nonumber\\\\ l_2&=&\\frac{1}{3\\pi}\\int\\bigg\\{4r^2\\dot{v}_i\\mathcal{x}_{2ij}\\dot{v}_j\\sin^2f_0     + 2g^2 b\\sin^2f_0 - 2g^2 b\\cos^2f_0\\nonumber\\\\ & & + 4r^2\\dot{v}_i\\mathcal{x}_{2ij}\\dot{v}_jf_0'^2\\sin^2f_0 - 2g'^2 b\\sin^2f_0    + 2g^2 b f_0'^2\\sin^2f_0\\nonumber\\\\ & & -4gg ' b f_0'\\sin(2f_0)-2g^2 b f_0'^2\\cos^2f_0-r^2g'^2   + 2\\dot{g}^2 b \\sin^2f_0\\nonumber\\\\ & & + r^2\\dot{g}^2 + 4\\dot{v}_i\\mathcal{y}_{2ij}\\dot{v}_j\\sin^4f_0   + \\frac{2g^2}{r^2}\\mathcal{i}_0\\sin^4f_0   -\\frac{6g^2}{r^2}\\mathcal{i}_0(\\sin^2f_0)(\\cos^2f_0)\\nonumber\\\\ & &   -\\frac{1}{r^2}v_i\\mathcal{i}_{2ij}v_j\\sin^4f_0-g^2m^2r^2\\cos(pf_0)\\bigg\\}\\,dr\\;. \\label{pertlag12}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    notice that the perturbation of the radial profile and the rational map are completely decoupled .",
    "we can thus study the radial and angular vibration modes separately . to do this",
    "we must compute the euler - lagrange equations for @xmath29 and for @xmath55 to linear order and solve the resulting eigen value equations .",
    "the equation for the rational map vibrations @xmath52 is straightforward to derive from ( [ pertlag ] ) and can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are numerical parameters which can be evaluated numerically .",
    "we provide their value for the case @xmath59 and @xmath60 and @xmath61 in tables [ tableg1 ] and [ tableg2 ] .    .@xmath62 ,",
    "@xmath63 , @xmath64 , for @xmath59 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     its description of the energy density matches that of the broken @xmath65 , @xmath66 translational zero mode obtained from the rational map ansatz ; however , this representation , @xmath67 , coincides with the doublet of @xmath65 , @xmath66 translational zero mode of the 2-monopole toroidal bps solution .",
    "the rational map ansatz has been shown to be a good approximation to the shell - like solutions of the skyrme model , _",
    "i.e. _ when the pion mass is null or relatively small , or when the baryon number is small . in this paper",
    "we have shown that the rational map ansatz can also be used to study the vibration modes of the skyrmion solutions and that qualitatively it produces the correct vibration modes . for @xmath0 ,",
    "for which the ansatz is actually the exact solution , and @xmath1 , the vibration modes are all predicted , but for @xmath2 they are all predicted except for one , the one with the largest vibration frequencies .",
    "on the other hand , the vibration frequencies obtained from the rational map ansatz are quite poor when compared to the frequencies obtained numerically in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the relative order is not even correct .",
    "we interpret this result by saying that the rational map ansatz is too stiff and that the configuration is restrained to vibrate in a subspace that is too narrow .",
