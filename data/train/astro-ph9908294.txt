    "smoothed particle hydrodynamical ( sph ) simulations of galaxy formation in cold dark matter ( cdm ) dominated universes have repeatedly failed to create milky way - type extended discs ( navarro & benz 1991 ; katz 1992 ; navarro , frenk & white 1995 ; steinmetz & muller 1995 ; navarro & steinmetz 1997 ; weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 , hereafter wee98 ) .",
    "gas is found to cool very effectively at high redshifts into the centres of haloes before gravitational torques from surrounding perturbations can supply it with sufficient angular momentum .",
    "furthermore the lumpy nature of the subsequent halo evolution leads to an outward transfer of angular momentum , compounding the problem .",
    "navarro & steinmetz ( 1997 ) showed that including a photoionizing background to suppress the early cooling of gas , worsened the problem by preferentially decreasing the amount of higher angular momentum gas accreted at late epochs .",
    "almost all analytic and semi - analytic models of galaxy formation assume that angular momentum is conserved during disc formation ( mestel 1963 ; fall & efstathiou 1980 ; gunn 1982 ; van der kruit 1987 ; cole 1994 ; dalcanton , spergel & summers 1997 ; mo , mao & white 1998 ) , in marked contrast to what is found in numerical simulations .",
    "it is interesting to note that cole ( 1994 ) actually find that their predicted tully - fisher relation has galaxies spinning @xmath6 per cent too rapidly at fixed luminosity , or alternatively being underluminous at fixed circular velocity .",
    "evidently , the degree to which angular momentum is conserved during galaxy formation is of vital importance in developing realistic theoretical models for comparison with observations .",
    "given that high angular momentum gas is required to produce a rapidly spinning large stellar disc , and recognising that the collapse of gas to form such a disc will , if anything , transfer angular momentum to the halo , it is apparent that a significant reservoir of hot gas must be maintained in the galactic halo at least until the epoch at which the halo specific angular momentum has grown to match that of real galaxies . as discussed above ,",
    "numerical simulations have generally failed to do this .",
    "navarro & benz ( 1991 ) , wee98 and others , have suggested that the inclusion of a more effective feedback mechanism , in particular , energy injection from supernovae ( see _ e.g. _ larson 1974 , dekel and silk 1986 ) is the most likely solution to this problem . to illustrate the importance of feedback",
    ", wee98 performed several sph simulations of haloes selected from cdm initial conditions in an @xmath7 , @xmath8 , universe with radiative cooling suppressed until a redshift @xmath1 .",
    "they did indeed find that suppressing the collapse of gas until late epochs had a dramatic effect on the specific angular momentum of the final galaxies .",
    "however , only two out of five carefully selected haloes produced objects with comparable angular momenta to those of real disc galaxies .",
    "this suggests that even with an extreme feedback prescription , there may be a problem explaining the frequency and angular momenta of disc galaxies in a critical density cdm universe with @xmath4 .",
    "this problem is investigated in more detail in this letter and the sensitivity of the specific angular momenta of the final objects to the assumed background cosmology is tested .",
    "the same simplified feedback prescription of wee98 is adopted , _",
    "i.e. _ radiative cooling is suppressed until @xmath1 , and applied to a total of @xmath6 sph simulations for two spatially flat cdm universes , one with @xmath9 and @xmath4 and the other with @xmath10 and @xmath11 . section  [ sec : sims ] contains details of the two cosmological models , the initial conditions of the sph simulations and the simulations themselves .",
    "the results are presented in section  [ sec : res ] and discussed in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "the two spatially flat cdm cosmological models that are investigated have scale invariant initial fluctuations and a post - recombination power spectrum given by the parametrisation of efstathiou , bond & white ( 1992 ) with a shape parameter @xmath12 .",
    "one model , referred to as  ( following the nomenclature of thomas 1998 ) has a matter density parameter @xmath13 and zero cosmological constant .",
    "the other model ,  has @xmath10 and a cosmological constant contributing @xmath11 to the density parameter ; the parameters for this model are close to those favoured by anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation and the distances of type ia supernovae ( see _ e.g. _ efstathiou 1999 ) .",
    "the amplitude of the mass fluctuations has been normalised to reproduce the present day abundance of galaxy clusters , thus the linear theory _",
    "rms _ mass fluctuations in spheres of radius @xmath14 are @xmath15 and @xmath16 for the  and  models respectively ( eke 1996 ) . in both models",
    "the hubble constant is set to @xmath17 is defined such that @xmath18 . ] , giving an age for the  universe of @xmath19  gyr and @xmath20  gyr for .",
    "the baryonic contribution to the critical density is set to @xmath21 in both models , consistent with the predictions of primordial nucleosynthesis and the deuterium abundance measurements reported by burles & tytler ( 1998 ) .      to create initial conditions for the sph simulations , a dark matter only calculation",
    "was performed for each cosmology using the ap@xmath22 m code of couchman ( 1991 ) . for each cosmology",
    ", a @xmath23 @xmath24  cube containing @xmath25 particles was evolved from @xmath26 to the present employing @xmath27 timesteps of equal size in expansion factor .",
    "the effective plummer gravitational force softening was fixed in comoving coordinates at @xmath28 kpc .",
    "identical random phases were used in both simulations so that the same haloes in both cosmologies could be simulated at higher resolution with the sph code .",
    "the spherical overdensity group - finding algorithm ( lacey & cole 1994 ) was applied to the final outputs of the dark matter simulations to locate virialised haloes , with the virial radius defined by the spherical collapse model .",
    "a subset of these were chosen for resimulation with the sph code . to qualify for resimulation ,",
    "a halo had to be at least @xmath29 from any other containing at least @xmath30 particles at @xmath3 .",
    "this constraint was applied so that the effort in the resimulation was concentrated on the central object rather than a more massive companion .",
    "it effectively biases against haloes in dense environments and can be loosely thought of as selecting a sample of field galaxies .",
    "twenty haloes that could clearly be identified as the same object in both  and  simulations with circular velocities in the range @xmath31 in the  run were selected for resimulation ( referred to as ` common ' haloes hereafter ) . as the corresponding  haloes had systematically lower circular velocities ( by about @xmath32 per cent ) , @xmath33 additional larger  and @xmath34 smaller  haloes were also chosen to increase the overlap in circular velocity between the two models .",
    "wee98 adopted similar algorithms to select haloes , but also imposed an additional constraint that the haloes should not have merged with a comparable mass system between @xmath1 and @xmath3 .",
    "this criterion was imposed to bias against haloes that suffered a major merger at late times and hence to select haloes more favourable to the formation of disc systems .",
    "no such criterion was applied in generating initial conditions for the simulations described in this paper .",
    "the procedure for creating high resolution initial conditions for resimulation is as described by wee98 .",
    "briefly , this involved tracing back to the initial redshift all dark matter particles within @xmath35  kpc of the selected halo centres at @xmath3 .",
    "extra particles were placed in a ` high resolution ' cube containing the region of interest ( and including the short wavelength fluctuations associated with this improved resolution ) and more massive particles were added to sample the distant density field . @xmath36",
    "dark matter and @xmath36 gas particles ( initially at identical positions to the dark particles ) were used in the central cube , while the outer regions were represented by @xmath37 particles with radially increasing masses .",
    "the sizes of the high resolution cubes were typically about @xmath38 and @xmath39 for  and  simulations , yielding gas particle masses of @xmath40 and @xmath41 respectively .",
    "higher resolution runs with @xmath42 particles were also performed for some of the  haloes that produced inadequately resolved stellar discs .",
    "the evolution of the simulation was performed using the grapesph code outlined in wee98 and @xmath33 grape@xmath43 boards ( sugimoto 1990 ) connected to a sun ultra@xmath44 workstation .",
    "the plummer gravitational force softening for gas and star particles was @xmath45  kpc and the dark matter had softenings of @xmath46  kpc and @xmath47  kpc for  and  respectively .",
    "up to @xmath48 timesteps for  and @xmath49 for  runs were used to evolve the particles from @xmath26 to @xmath3 .",
    "typical run times were @xmath50 days for each  simulation and @xmath51 days for a  simulation .",
    "radiative cooling was switched on at @xmath1 in all cases to model feedback crudely , as described by wee98 .",
    "each gas particle that remained in a collapsing region with @xmath52 kg m@xmath53 ( see navarro & white 1993 , wee98 ) for a local dynamical time was converted to a star particle .",
    "the same number of particles is used in the high resolution regions even though these differ in volume from run - to - run .",
    "the numerical resolution of the sph simulations is therefore variable and correlated with the mass of the halo .",
    "navarro & steinmetz ( 1997 ) discussed in detail the outward transport of angular momentum when the sph artificial viscosity acts on a poorly resolved gaseous disc . as a result of the star formation algorithm adopted here , the gaseous discs do not monotonically increase their masses , and thus the effect of this viscous transport is probably increasing as the simulations approach @xmath3 and the accretion rate diminishes .",
    "however , by analysing the conservation of angular momentum as a function of the number of star particles within @xmath54 kpc of the halo centre , it was found that only systems with less than @xmath55 stars showed any significant trend of increasing angular momentum with increasing mass resolution .",
    "consequently , results will only be given for simulations that had at least @xmath56 stars in the central object at @xmath3 .",
    "figure  [ fig : dircomp ] shows an object by object comparison of the stellar specific angular momenta for the common haloes in the two sets of simulations .",
    "the stellar angular momentum is measured for the central galaxy - like object within @xmath54 kpc of its centre .",
    "there is essentially no correlation between the two quantities .",
    "however , the galaxies in the  simulations tend to have significantly more angular momentum than their  counterparts . the reasons for this difference will be discussed in more detail below .",
    "figure  [ fig : jom ] shows the absolute specific angular momenta of all the dark matter haloes ( not just the common haloes ) , measured at the virial radius , and their largest stellar occupants , as a function of halo circular velocity .",
    "the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : jom ] show the ranges of specific angular momenta of real disc galaxies . for dark haloes with the navarro , frenk and white ( 1996 ) profile , the disc rotation velocity may exceed the halo circular speed at the virial radius by as much as @xmath32@xmath57 % , depending on the concentration of the stellar disc .",
    "this difference is neglected in this paper . ]",
    "( see figure 1 of wee98 ) .",
    "while the haloes in both cosmologies occupy a similar locus ( for @xmath58 , the  haloes are only @xmath59 per cent higher than those for ) , the  stellar objects are at systematically much lower values than those from the  simulations . for both sets of simulations",
    "the fraction of halo specific angular momentum retained in the stellar objects decreases with increasing circular speed .",
    "thus in comparing the two cosmologies , attention will be restricted to haloes with circular speeds in the same range , @xmath58 . for the @xmath60  and @xmath61",
    "haloes that this range includes , the median ratios of stellar to halo specific angular momenta at @xmath3 are @xmath62 and @xmath63 respectively .",
    "one reason for this difference is that although haloes in the  and  models with the same circular speed have similar angular momenta at @xmath3 , the angular momentum growth depends on the background cosmology . as a consequence of the continual evolution of structure in the  model ,",
    "haloes acquire relatively more angular momentum since @xmath1 than haloes in the  model .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : dmjomrat ] . since typically half of the stars are formed by @xmath64 in the  simulations and by @xmath65 for , it is more appropriate to compare final stellar angular momenta with those of the parent haloes at @xmath1 when disc formation begins . for haloes with circular speeds in the range",
    "@xmath66 the median ratios of stellar to halo specific angular momenta at @xmath1 , are @xmath67 and @xmath68 for  and  respectively .",
    "thus a major reason for the differences in final stellar angular momenta in the two cosmologies is that  haloes have lower angular momenta at @xmath69 compared with  haloes of the same circular speed .",
    "the other main cause of the difference in stellar angular momenta in the two cosmologies stems from the more inhomogeneous evolution at @xmath70 suffered by  haloes . as a consequence of the higher frequency of merger events in the  cosmology ,",
    "the accretion at late times of high angular momentum gas from the outer parts of the halo is disrupted . either the gas is gravitationally shocked and remains extended , or its angular momentum is transported to larger radii by torques from the anisotropic halo .",
    "figure  [ fig : mvirrat ] shows how the fraction of conserved specific angular momentum varies with the halo growth , parametrised by the ratio of halo virial masses at @xmath1 to @xmath3 .",
    "it is clear that the  haloes accrete significantly less mass than those evolving in the  model .",
    "galaxies forming in the  cosmology experience fewer merger events and conserve a greater fraction of their angular momentum .",
    "the aim of this work has been to investigate how the background cosmological model affects the efficiency with which angular momentum is conserved during galaxy formation .",
    "the large set of simulations described here shows that the specific angular momenta of galaxies with halo circular speeds in the range @xmath71@xmath72 forming in a  universe are typically @xmath51 times higher than those in a  universe .",
    "this large difference arises from the more turbulent merger histories of the  haloes and from their lower specific angular momenta .",
    "the median specific angular momentum for observed disc galaxies ( see the dashed lines in figure  [ fig : jom ] and figure 1 of wee98 ) is , nevertheless , about @xmath73 times as large as that of the  galaxies simulated here , and an order of magnitude above the  galaxies .",
    "this discrepancy for the  model is extremely large , confirming the suspicion of wee98 that the observed frequency of disc galaxies is difficult to reproduce in a spatially flat cdm model with @xmath4 . allowing cooling at higher redshift would exacerbate this problem ( see wee98 ) , and it seems unlikely that a more realistic feedback process could resolve this discrepancy .    in both cosmologies there is a strong trend for galaxies with high circular speeds to lose more angular momentum , suggesting that it is difficult to form large disc galaxies within haloes with circular speeds of @xmath74 at the virial radius .",
    "this is qualitatively consistent with the observed lack of spiral discs with high circular speeds .",
    "most of the simulated galaxies in the  cosmology lie below the observed range of specific angular momenta for real disc systems , though the magnitude of the discrepancy is much lower than in the  cosmology .",
    "this may not be an insurmountable problem for the  model .",
    "the observational range plotted in figure  [ fig : jom ] is computed from the specific angular momenta of only the disc components , whereas the specific angular momenta of the simulated galaxies have been calculated using the entire stellar system . in a more realistic scenario ,",
    "the low angular momentum gas might be expected to give rise to a bulge - type stellar component in addition to providing the feedback energy to maintain the reservoir of hot , extended and high angular momentum gas at large redshift .",
    "figure  [ fig : hole ] shows that removing all stars within a @xmath5 kpc sphere of the centres of the final stellar objects can bring the  galaxies with circular speeds @xmath75 into agreement with the observations .",
    "the choice of @xmath5 kpc is arbitrary and has been adopted merely to illustrate the importance of correctly distinguishing between an inner bulge and an extended disc before comparing simulations with observations . to do this",
    "more accurately will require a more realistic feedback prescription and much larger numerical simulations in which bulge and disc components can be distinguished kinematically .",
    "until such simulations are performed , it is unclear whether the  model can account for the observed frequency of disc galaxies .",
    "however , galaxies forming in a -like universe experience a severe ` angular momentum catastrophe ' and this seems to be a fundamental problem for such a model .",
