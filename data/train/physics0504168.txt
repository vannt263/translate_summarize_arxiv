    "systems composed of many parts that interact with each other in a non - trivial way are often referred to as _",
    "complex systems_. the social relations between individuals can perhaps be included in this category .",
    "an intriguing issue concerns the role played by the topological structure of the social network in governing the dynamical behaviour of the system .",
    "recent studies of the topological properties of interactions in different biological , social and technological systems has made it possible to shed some light on the basic principles of structural self - organization .",
    "a few examples include the food webs  @xcite , power grids and neural networks  @xcite , cellular networks  @xcite , sexual contacts  @xcite , internet routers  @xcite , the world wide web  @xcite , actor collaborations  @xcite , the citation networks of scientists  @xcite and the stock market  @xcite .",
    "although different in the underlying interaction dynamics or _ micro - physics _ , all these networks have shown a tendency to self - organize in structures that share common features .",
    "in particular , the number of connections , @xmath2 , for each element , or node , of the network follow a power law distribution , @xmath3 .",
    "networks that fulfill this property are referred to as _ scale - free _ ( sf ) networks .",
    "in addition many of these networks are characterized by a high clustering coefficient , @xmath4 , in comparison with random graphs  @xcite .",
    "the clustering coefficient , @xmath4 , is computed as the average of local clustering , @xmath5 , for the @xmath6th node , defined as @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total number of nodes linked to the site @xmath6 and @xmath9 is the total number of links between those nodes . as",
    "a consequence both @xmath5 and @xmath4 lie in the interval [ 0,1 ] .",
    "the high level of clustering found supports the idea that a _ herding _ phenomenon is a common feature in social and biological communities .",
    "numerical studies on sf networks have demonstrated how the topology plays a fundamental role in infection spreading  @xcite and tolerance against random and preferential node removal  @xcite .",
    "a detailed description of the progress in this emerging field of statistical mechanics can be found in the recent reviews of refs .",
    "@xcite . in the present work",
    "we investigate the implication of a scale - free topology in a stochastic opinion formation model .",
    "similar versions of this model have been tested in regular lattices  @xcite and percolation clusters  @xcite .",
    "these models adopt a mean field approach where the interactions are extended between all the individuals in the lattice or cluster respectively .",
    "in contrast , our simulation focuses on the role of short - range first - neighbour interactions for cases where the topological structure of the interactions is not trivial .    in the next section",
    "we describe the model used for the simulation . in sec .  [",
    "numerical ] we show the results obtained numerically while in sec .  [ indecision ] we investigate the importance of failures in the network during the process of opinion formation while sec .  [ 3states ] the two state model is extended to three states and the numerical results are compared . in sec .",
    "[ dj ] and  [ mf_analysis ] we test the results of our simulations against the best known social network : the stock market .",
    "in particular the time series of average opinion fluctuations obtained with the model is compared with the time series of price variations for the dow jones index from 13/1/1930 to 13/4/2004 .",
    "the final section presents further discussion and conclusions .",
    "in the present work we investigate the opinion formation process of a group of @xmath10 individuals , represented by nodes on a sf network .",
    "the mechanism of opinion formation is simulated using stochastic heat bath dynamics with feedback .",
    "the opinion of each agent is of a boolean type .",
    "that is , at each discrete time step , @xmath11 , the opinion is represented by one of two possible states ( or spin orientations ) , namely @xmath12 , for the @xmath6th agent .",
    "a practical example could be the decision to buy , @xmath13 , or sell , @xmath14 , a stock in a virtual stock market .    in order to mimic the scale - free network topology we make use of the barab@xmath1si - albert model  @xcite .",
    "this is based on two main assumption : ( i ) linear growth and ( ii ) preferential attachment . in practice",
    "the network is initialized with @xmath15 disconnected nodes . at each step a new node with @xmath16 edges",
    "is added to the pre - existing network .",
    "the probability that an edge of the new node is linked with the @xmath6th node is expressed by @xmath17 .",
    "the iteration of this preferential growing process yields a scale free network , @xmath3 where @xmath18 .",
    "it is worth noting that the barab@xmath1si - albert model can not reproduce a high clustering coefficient .",
    "in fact , the value of this coefficient depends on the total number of nodes in the network  @xcite and in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath19 , @xmath20 . in principle",
    "the observed local clustering can play an important role in the opinion formation of groups of people , independent of their total number . in order to account for this ,",
    "we introduce a further step in the growth process , namely the triad formation proposed by holme and kim  @xcite . in this case , if the new added node is linked with an older node , @xmath6 , having other links , then with a certain probability , @xmath21 , the next link of the new node , if any remain , will be added to a randomly selected neighbour of node @xmath6 .",
    "this method of introducing friends to friends , while preserving the scale - free nature of the networks , generates high clustering coefficients that do not depend on the number of nodes in the network .",
    "the only tunable parameter that changes the value of the clustering coefficient is the clustering probability @xmath21 .",
    "an example of sf network generated with this algorithm is shown in fig .",
    "[ netplot ] for 500 nodes .",
    "once the scale - free network has been built , we randomly assign the spin values , @xmath0 , to every node and start the simulation of opinion formation .",
    "we neglect , in the first approximation , the network dynamics .",
    "this is equivalent to assuming that the time scale for evolving the network is much longer that the time needed for people to make a decision .",

    "the terms @xmath32 and @xmath33 are random variables uniformly distributed in the interval ( -1,1 ) with no correlation in time nor in the network .",

    "the strength term , @xmath34 , is constant and common for the whole network , while @xmath35 is specifically chosen for every individual from a uniform distribution in ( 0,@xmath36 ) and are both constant in the dynamics of the system . by varying the parameter @xmath36 we can give more or less weight to the role of feedback in the model .",

    "at first we investigate the importance of the group strength @xmath34 by fixing @xmath38 . in this case",

    "while varying @xmath21 , does not lead to any substantial difference in the dynamics of the model , the increase of the average number of links per node , @xmath47 , has a dramatic effect in the turbulent - like phase , as shown in fig .",

    "the kurtosis , ( @xmath48 , where @xmath49 denotes the temporal average ) , of the time series of the average opinion , used to quantify the deviation from a noise regime , is plotted against _ m_.",

    "if we take the thermodynamic limit , where @xmath50 and @xmath51 , then the coupling strengths between agents can be approximated well by the average strength over all the network and a mean field approach becomes appropriate to describe the dynamics of the model .",

    "it is also worth pointing out that an increase of @xmath56 is related to a decrease in the average path length between nodes ; that is , the network `` shrinks '' and becomes more compact . in relation to our previous discussion ,",
    "the more compact the network is the more the dynamics of our system approaches to the mean field approximation .",
    "it becomes easier for the agents to synchronize .",
    "this characteristic of compactness , referred to as the _ small world effect _",
    "@xcite , is actually very common in both real and artificial networks .",
    "we further investigate the importance of the sf network topology and the the small world effect in our model by performing a numerical simulation of the same system but using a _ random network _",
    "( rn ) or _ random graph _ as the underlying topology . given a fixed a number of nodes , _",
    "n _ , a rn is defined by the probability @xmath57 that two nodes are linked together  @xcite . in this case",
    "@xmath58 and , moreover , there exists a critical value , @xmath59 , for which the the network undergoes a topological phase transition where it moves from a phase where it is composed of a collection of small , disjoint , sub - networks to a phase where a giant cluster emerges .",
    "random networks , while preserving small world properties , have a poisson degree distribution  @xcite , @xmath60 , and small clustering coefficients .",
    "as previously mentioned , we make use of the rn to test the robustness of our model with respect to the topology used and to learn about the most important properties relevant to the dynamics . in order to do so",
    ", we fix the number of agents and the average number of links for the sf and rn , namely @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "then we perform independent numerical simulations on the two topologies .",

    "the results , shown in fig .",
    "[ pdf_double ] ( left ) demonstrate how the dynamics of the two systems are largely equivalent under the adopted constrains . in fig .",
    "[ pdf_double ] ( right ) we also show the dependence of the dynamics on the parameter @xmath57 for the rn . at the critical threshold , that is the value of @xmath57 for which a giant cluster appears",
    ", there is still no trace of turbulent - like activity giving rise to fat tails . yet , in this case each agent has , on average , just one link and there can not be any small world properties .",
    "these results confirm that the critical topological characteristic leading to herding behaviour in the framework of stochastic opinion formation is the presence of mean field effects enhanced by small - world structure . the more information ( links ) that an agent has , the more likely it is for him / her to have an opinion in accord with other agents .    in the next section",
    "we extend our model in order to include indecision in the process of opinion formation .",
    "we now extend our model in order to include the concept of indecision . in practice a certain agent @xmath6 , at a time step @xmath11 ,",
    "may take neither of the two possible decisions , @xmath64 , but remain in a neutral state . keeping faith to the spirit of the model",
    ", we address this problem introducing an _ indecision probability _ , @xmath65 : that is the probability to find , at each time step , a certain agent undecided .",
    "this is equivalent to introducing time dependent failures in the structure of the network by setting @xmath66 .",
    "focusing on the turbulent - like regime , the shape of the pdf in the opinion fluctuations changes according to different concentrations of undecided persons .",
    "the results of the simulations , in fig .",
    "[ pdf_rand ] , show how the dynamics of the model move from an intermittent state for @xmath67 toward a noise state for @xmath68 . the convergence to a gaussian distribution is obtained only for quite high concentrations of undecided agents at about 60% .",
    "the robustness of the turbulent - like behaviour is related to the intrinsic robustness of sf networks against random failures  @xcite .",
    "in fact , because there is a large absolute number of poorly connected nodes , related to the power law shape of @xmath60 , the probability of setting one of them to inactive is much higher compared to the `` hubs '' that are relatively rare .",
    "we can claim that , in large social networks governed by stochastic reactions in their elements , large fluctuations in the average opinion can appear even in the case in which a large part of the network is actually `` inactive '' provided that the structure is scale free and the indecision is randomly distributed .",
    "the existence of large hubs provides for the survival of extended sub - networks in which synchronization can give rise to coherent events .",
    "the structure of the network itself supplies the random indecision .",
    "now we address the question of how the dynamics may change if we do not choose randomly the inactive nodes but we target the nodes having the most links .",
    "what we do in practice is to sort the nodes according to their number of links and then deactivate the nodes having the largest number of links in decreasing order .",
    "[ pdf_aim ] illustrates how the fragmentation process is much faster and the noise regime is reached already when only the 10% of the hubs are deactivated . as emphasized in ref .",
    "@xcite , the hubs have a great importance in the structural properties of sf networks and specifically targeting these nodes can lead to sudden isolation of a large fraction of the nodes of the network .",
    "in the previous section we introduced random and targeted failures in order to study the response of the system to changes in the network topology . in a real social network the reason behind the indecision of a person follows much more complex rules and can depend on different factors as , for example , unsatisfactory information obtained by his / her sources . as seen from eq .",
    "( [ field ] ) , the opinion of each agent depends on the poll of his / her network links .",
    "suppose now that the agent @xmath6 has @xmath69 neighbours where @xmath70 of these share the opinion + 1 while the remaining @xmath70 share the opposite opinion .",
    "in this case , unless we give specific weights to each node , the agent @xmath6 will not have an easy task in choosing one of the two possible positions because of a lack of popular consensus .",
    "based on this idea derived from common sense , we can extend our two state model by introducing an _ induced indecision probability _ , @xmath71 , dependent on the information available to the agents at each time step .",
    "in particular we define the global opinion of the neighbours of the @xmath6th node as @xmath72 and the indecision probability for the @xmath6th node at time @xmath11 @xmath73 where the indecision probability width , @xmath74 , is a parameter of the model and @xmath75 a normalization constant that depends just on the structure of the network .",
    "it calculated at the beginning of the simulation by imposing @xmath76 , i.e. the sum of the indecision probabilities over all possible global opinions to be one .",
    "the model of eq .",
    "( [ mu ] ) assumes a gaussian probability , centered in @xmath77 , for the distribution of indecision of the @xmath6th agent .",
    "that is , the probability of having this agent in a state with @xmath78 is greater when there is not a large agreement in the opinion of the his / her sources .",
    "the analysis of the time series generated by the three state model does not present any relevant difference if compared with the two state model with the same parameters , fig .",

    "[ pdf_inac ] .",
    "it is interesting to notice how this distribution is not gaussian distributed around the average but it is skewed on one side .",
    "moreover , only a small fraction of agents is undecided , of the order of 10/15 % .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that in opinion polls most of the participants actually indicate an opinion .",
    "the model for opinion formation discussed thus far can be tested against the best known real social network : the stock market .",
    "the main idea is to compare our results with some _ stylized facts _ concerning the price time series , @xmath80 and , in particular , with the properties of the logarithm of the price fluctuations , or _",

    "moreover the returns show an intermittent behaviour , reminiscent of hydrodynamic turbulence  @xcite , also characterized by power law tails in the pdf . in this case",
    "the large coherent events are related to crashes or other anomalous variations of price .",
    "if we assume that the variation of price is directly proportional to changes in demand and supply , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is proportional to the average opinion , @xmath84 , then the returns are proportional to the average opinion @xmath85 . using this assumption",

    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , here the price feedback is not an essential ingredient for the reproduction of the correct shape of the distribution .",
    "rather it is the herding behaviour that plays the main role , as observed from fig .",
    "[ pdf_k ] .",
    "the similarities between the artificial time series generated by the virtual social network and the stock market extend beyond the fat tails in of pdf of the fluctuations to temporal correlations .",
    "it is well known that the stock market returns have negligible correlations on daily intervals while the _ volatility _ , @xmath86 , defined as their absolute value , have a slow power law decrease as a function of the time lag .",
    "this phenomenon is known as _ volatility clustering _  @xcite . in order to make a comparison with our model we make use of the autocorrelation function , @xmath87 . for a time series of @xmath88 samples , @xmath89 for @xmath90 ,",

    "an heat bath dynamics , similar to the one used in the present simulations , is applied to dynamical percolation clusters , used as a paradigm for agents aggregation .",
    "the temporal evolution of the clusters , which size follows a power law distribution , is related to a forest - fire dynamics in which some potential traders are attracted in the market by other already active traders while , at the same time , some of them may temporally quit the trading .",
    "large fluctuations in the price changes are due to the synchronization in the of the larger clusters in the market at a particular time .",
    "the main qualitative difference between this model and the one presented so far is that the former presents a decay rate much closer to that of the real market . at this point",
    "it is important to underline that the main difference between the two models is related to the network dynamics . while in the present simulation the network is fixed , in ref",

    "we can argue that the dynamics of the networks and , in particular , the clustering of agents in different sub - networks can play an important role in the correlation properties of the stock market volatility .",
    "in reality , this fact appears quite natural if we use the autocorrelation function , defined in eq .",

    "we also notice an interesting discrepancy in the autocorrelation function for the volatility . comparing the present results with those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite , we conjecture that the persistence in the volatility memory can be explained by considering the market as constituted by sub - systems at local equilibrium and weakly interacting with each other",
    ". it will be interesting to explore this conjecture in a quantitative manner in a further investigation .",

    "<S> the dynamics of opinion formation in large groups of people is a complex non - linear phenomenon whose investigation is just at the beginning . </S>",
    "<S> both collective behaviour and personal view play an important role in this mechanism . in the present work we mimic the dynamics of opinion formation of a group of agents , represented by two states @xmath0 , as a stochastic response of each agent to the opinion of his / her neighbours in the social network and to feedback from the average opinion of the whole . in the light of recent studies , </S>",
    "<S> a scale - free barab@xmath1si - albert network has been selected to simulate the topology of the interactions . </S>",
    "<S> a turbulent - like dynamics , characterized by an intermittent behaviour , is observed for a certain range of the model parameters . the problem of uncertainty in decision taking is also addressed both from a topological point of view , using random and targeted removal of agents from the network , and by implementing a three state model , where the third state , zero , is related to the information available to each agent . </S>",
    "<S> finally , the results of the model are tested against the best known network of social interactions : the stock market . </S>",
    "<S> a time series of daily closures of the dow jones index has been used as an indicator of the possible applicability of our model in the financial context . </S>",
