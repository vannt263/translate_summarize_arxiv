    "this is my first visit to frascati , and it has been thrilling for me to be in this laboratory of such great significance to the development of electron  positron colliding beams .",
    "i have greatly enjoyed the engagement between theory and experiment in the laboratory , the spirit of this week s workshop , and the sense of anticipation for the da@xmath0ne  physics program .",
    "i am delighted that our hosts have arranged a post - workshop visit to the vatican museums and the sistine chapel . in february of 1988",
    ", i brought my children to rome during their school vacation .",
    "in the course of our visit to the vatican museums , we came across a temporary exhibition in which a panel displayed a passage that struck me as so remarkable and perceptive that i copied it down in my notebook :    x|x il _ de rerum natura _ di lucrezio  la prima grande opera di poesia in cui la conoscenza del mondo diventa dissoluzione della compattezza del mondo , percezione di ci che  infinamente muto e mobile e leggero .",
    "lucrezio vuole scrivere il poema della materia ma ci avverte subito che la vera realt di questa materia  fatta di corpuscoli invisibili .",
    " il poeta della concretezza fisica , vista nella sua sostanza permanente e immutibile , ma per prima cosa ci dice che il vuoto  altrettanto concreto che i corpi solidi .",
    "la pi grande preoccupazione di lucrezio sembra quella di evitare che il peso della materia ci schiacci .",
    "italo calvino , `` leggerezza , '' in + _ lezioni americane _ ( 1988 ) +    & the _ de rerum natura _ of lucretius is the first great work of poetry in which knowledge of the world tends to dissolve the solidity of the world , leading to a perception of all that is infinitely minute , light , and mobile .",
    "lucretius set out to write the poem of physical matter , but he warns us at the outset that this matter is made up of invisible particles .",
    "he is the poet of physical concreteness , viewed in its permanent and immutable substance , but the first thing he tells us is that emptiness is just as concrete as solid bodies .",
    "lucretius chief concern is to prevent the weight of matter from crushing us ",
    "+ italo calvino , `` lightness , '' in + _ six memos for the next millennium _ +    the text is taken from the charles eliot norton lectures that calvino prepared to deliver at harvard . back in berkeley",
    ", i found a copy of the american translation , _ six memos for the next millennium , _ one of the great short works of literary analysis and appreciation.@xcite in the translation , i found that the passage on a panel in the vatican museums concludes , `` the poetry of the invisible , of infinite unexpected possibilities  even the poetry of nothingness  issues from a poet who had no doubts whatever about the physical reality of the world . '' for us who have no doubts whatever about the physical reality of the world , who experience daily the poetry of the invisible , of infinite unexpected possibilities  even of nothingness ",
    "it is inspiring to see our passion and our confidence in nature reflected in calvino s scan of lucretius .",
    "i hope that each of you will have a similar epiphany in the vatican museums tomorrow .",
    "for half a century , the strange particles have offered us important clues to the nature of matter and the character of the forces that shape the world .",
    "it is interesting to consider some of the phenomena that pointed the way to our current picture of constituents and interactions , and the lessons we drew  or could have drawn  from them .    *",
    "_ strangeness .",
    "_ + at a time when the significance of isospin was incompletely appreciated , the @xmath1 mesons and hyperons showed us the importance of an imperfectly conserved quantum number , and of the notion that different interactions can respect different symmetries . +",
    "as our understanding of internal symmetries matured , strange particles pointed the way to @xmath2 as a classification symmetry for the hadrons .",
    "the observation in the 1960s that all mesons fit into @xmath2 singlets and octets , and that all baryons fit into @xmath2 singlets , octets , and decimets , pointed to the quark model , with its rule that mesons are composed of @xmath3 and baryons of @xmath4 .",
    "it is important to note that the quark model gives us a new view of additive quantum numbers , not as quantities carried by particles  to be loaded and unloaded  but as defining attributes of the fundamental constituents , the quarks .",
    "+ the conflict between the symmetric @xmath5 wave function of the @xmath6 and the pauli principle led to the introduction of color as a hitherto unobserved quantum number and , eventually , to the development of quantum chromodynamics as the theory of the strong interactions . *",
    "_ kaon decays _ + the @xmath7 puzzle challenged the implicit notion that the fundamental interactions are invariant under parity , and set in motion the chain of investigations that gave us the @xmath8 theory of the ( charged - current ) weak interactions .",
    "+ the identification of @xmath9 and @xmath10 provided the opportunity to observe quantum - mechanical superposition effects over macroscopic distances and focused attention on eigenstates .",
    "+ the very different rates for the decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 gave evidence for the @xmath13 rule in nonleptonic weak decays .",
    "though we saw it only in retrospect , the nonleptonic `` octet '' enhancement that accounts for the @xmath13 rule requires colored quarks and the short - distance effects of the strong interaction .",
    "+ the notion of cabibbo universality gave rise to the idea of mixing between quark generations and laid the foundation for a theory of weak interactions based ( in part ) on @xmath14 symmetry , which gives the framework for a connection between quarks and leptons .",
    "* _ rare decays _ + the suppression of the strong decay @xmath15 gave us clues about the character of the strong interaction , embodied in the okubo ",
    "iizuka rule , and offered a template for understanding the inhibited decays of @xmath16 and @xmath17 into hadrons . + the absence of flavor - changing neutral currents inspired the second coming of charm and the glashow ",
    "maiani mechanism .",
    "+ the agreement between the observed rate for the decay @xmath18 and conventional expectations indicated that the charmed quark could not be arbitrarily heavy , and permitted an estimate @xmath19 .",
    "* _ violation _ + the observation of the -violating decay @xmath20 suggested the need for at least three doublets of quarks ( therefore of leptons ) and gave us reason to explore scenarios for cosmic baryogenesis .",
    "+ the discovery that the direct -violating parameter @xmath21 demonstrates that a superweak interaction is not the ( only ) source of  violation , and supports the phase in the quark - mixing matrix as the dominant origin of  violation . * @xmath22 _ mixing _ + the degree of @xmath22 mixing , which is to say the @xmath23 mass difference , together with the value of the -violating parameter @xmath24 , offered a hint that the mass of the top quark was quite large .",
    "not all of these items represent finished business .",
    "what clues have we missed ? what is to come ?",
    "twenty - five years after the november revolution , our understanding of physical phenomena is grounded in the identification of fundamental constituents , at the current limits of resolution of about @xmath25 , and a few fundamental forces . the constituents  our elementary particles",
    " are the pointlike quarks @xmath26 and leptons @xmath27 with strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions specified by @xmath28 gauge symmetries .",
    "it is instructive to consider the agenda of particle physics today under four rubrics :    * _ elementarity . _",
    "are the quarks and leptons structureless , or will we find that they are composite particles with internal structures that help us understand the properties of the individual quarks and leptons ? * _ symmetry .",
    "_ one of the most powerful lessons of the modern synthesis of particle physics is that ( local ) symmetries prescribe interactions .",
    "our investigation of symmetry must address the question of which gauge symmetries exist ( and , eventually , why ) .",
    "we must also understand how the symmetries are hidden from us in the world we inhabit . for the moment",
    ", the most urgent problem in particle physics is to complete our understanding of electroweak symmetry breaking by exploring the 1-tev scale .",
    "this is the business of the experiments at lep2 , the tevatron collider , and the large hadron collider . * _ unity . _ in the sense of developing explanations that apply not to one individual phenomenon in isolation , but to many phenomena in common , unity is central to all of physics , and indeed to all of science . at this moment in the development of particle physics ,",
    "the quest for unity takes several forms .",
    "first , we have the fascinating possibility of gauge coupling unification , the idea that all the interactions we encounter have a common origin and thus a common strength at suitably high energy .",
    "second , there is the imperative of anomaly freedom in the electroweak theory , which urges us to treat quarks and leptons together , not as completely independent species . both of these ideas are embodied , of course , in unified theories of the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions , which imply the existence of still other forces  to complete the grander gauge group of the unified theory  including interactions that change quarks into leptons .",
    "the third aspect of unity is the idea that the traditional distinction between force particles and constituents might give way to a unified understanding of all the particles .",
    "the gluons of qcd carry color charge , so we can imagine quarkless hadronic matter in the form of glueballs . beyond that breaking down of the wall between messengers and constituents , supersymmetry relates fermions and bosons . finally , we desire a reconciliation between the powerful outsider , gravity , and the forces that prevail in the quantum world of our everyday laboratory experience . * _ identity .",
    "_ we do not understand the physics that sets quark masses and mixings .",
    "although we are testing the idea that the phase in the quark - mixing matrix lies behind the observed   violation , we do not know what determines that phase . the accumulating evidence for neutrino oscillations presents us with a new embodiment of these puzzles in the lepton sector . at bottom",
    ", the question of identity is very simple to state : what makes an electron and electron , and a top quark a top quark ?",
    "one aspect of the problem of identity is the origin of mass . in particle physics , we know the challenge of explaining many different kinds of mass .",
    "the masses of the hadrons are ( in principle , and with increasing precision in practice ) understood from qcd in terms of the energy stored to confine a color - singlet configuration of quarks in a small volume.@xcite we also have an excellent understanding of the masses of the electroweak gauge bosons @xmath29 and @xmath30 as consequences of electroweak symmetry breaking , in terms of a single weak mixing parameter , @xmath31 . that sets the scale of the hadron masses .",
    "] when we get to the question of quark and ( charged ) lepton masses , however , our understanding is considerably more primitive . for each of these",
    ", we require not just the scale of electroweak symmetry breaking , but a distinct and apparently arbitrary higgs - fermion - antifermion yukawa coupling to reproduce the fermion mass . for neutrinos , which may be their own antiparticles , there are still more possibilities for new physics to enter , and , for the moment , more room for bafflement .",
    "as we have just remarked , electroweak symmetry breaking sets the values of the @xmath32- and @xmath33-boson masses . at tree level in the electroweak theory",
    ", we have @xmath34 where the electroweak scale is @xmath35 .",
    "but the electroweak scale is not the only scale .",
    "it seems certain that we must also consider the planck scale , derived from the strength of newton s constant , @xmath36 it is also probable that we must take account of the @xmath37 unification scale around @xmath38 . and , as we heard on the first day of the workshop from antonio masiero,@xcite there may well be a distinct flavor scale .",
    "the existence of other scales is behind the famous problem of the higgs scalar mass : how to keep the distant scales from mixing in the face of quantum corrections , or how to stabilize the mass of the higgs boson on the electroweak scale .",
    "it is because @xmath39 is so small ( or because @xmath40 is so large ) that we normally consider gravitation irrelevant for particle physics .",
    "the graviton - quark - antiquark coupling is generically @xmath41 , so it is easy to make a dimensional estimate of the branching fraction for a gravitationally mediated rare kaon decay : @xmath42 , which is truly negligible !    we know from the electroweak theory alone that the 1-tev scale is special .",
    "partial - wave unitarity applied to gauge - boson scattering tells us that unless the higgs - boson mass respects @xmath43 new physics is to be found on the 1-tev scale . to stabilize the higgs - boson mass against uncontrolled quantum corrections , and to resolve the mass - hierarchy problem",
    ", we consider electroweak physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the most promising approaches are to generalize @xmath28 to a theory with a composite higgs boson in which the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically ( technicolor and related theories ) or to a supersymmetric standard model .",
    "let us look a little further at the problem of fermion masses . in the electroweak theory ,",
    "the value of each quark or charged - lepton mass is set by a new , unknown , yukawa coupling .",
    "taking the electron as a prototype , we define the left - handed doublet and right - handed singlet @xmath44 then the yukawa term in the electroweak lagrangian is @xmath45 \\ ; ,      \\label{eq : eyuk}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the higgs field , so that the electron mass is @xmath47 .",
    "inasmuch as we do not know how to calculate the fermion yukawa couplings @xmath48 , i believe that _ we should consider the sources of all fermion masses as physics beyond the standard model .",
    "_    note that the values of the yukawa couplings are vastly different for different fermions : for the top quark , @xmath49 , for the electron @xmath50 , and if the neutrinos have dirac masses , presumably @xmath51 .",
    "what accounts for the range and values of the yukawa couplings ?",
    "our best hope until now has been the suggestion from unified theories that the pattern of fermion masses simplifies on high scales .",
    "the classic intriguing prediction of the @xmath52 unified theory involves the masses of the @xmath53 quark and the @xmath54 lepton , which are degenerate at the unification point for a simple pattern of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "the different running of the quark and lepton masses to low scales then leads to the prediction @xmath55 , in suggestive agreement with what we know from experiment .",
    "the conventional approach to new physics has been to extend the standard model to understand why the electroweak scale ( and the mass of the higgs boson ) is so much smaller than the planck scale.@xcite a novel approach that has been developed over the past two years is instead to _ change gravity _ to understand why the planck scale is so much greater than the electroweak scale .",
    "now , experiment tells us that gravitation closely follows the newtonian force law down to distances on the order of @xmath56 .",
    "below about a millimeter , the constraints on deviations from newton s inverse - square law deteriorate rapidly , so nothing prevents us from considering changes to gravity even on a small but macroscopic scale . for its internal consistency",
    ", string theory requires an additional six or seven space dimensions , beyond the @xmath57 dimensions of everyday experience . until recently it has been presumed that the extra dimensions must be compactified on the planck scale , with a compactification radius @xmath58 .",
    "the new wrinkle is to consider that the ( @xmath28 ) standard model gauge fields , plus needed extensions , reside on @xmath57-dimensional branes , not in the extra dimensions , but that gravity can propagate into the extra dimensions .",
    "how does this hypothesis change the picture ?",
    "the dimensional analysis ( gauss s law , if you like ) that relates newton s constant to the planck scale changes .",
    "if gravity propagates in @xmath59 extra dimensions with radius @xmath60 , then @xmath61 where @xmath62 is gravity s true scale .",
    "notice that if we boldly take @xmath62 to be as small as @xmath63 , then the radius of the extra dimensions is required to be smaller than about @xmath56 , for @xmath64 . what we know as the planck scale is then a mirage that results from a false extrapolation : treating gravity as four - dimensional down to arbitrarily small distances , when in fact  or at least in this particular fiction  gravity propagates in @xmath65 spatial dimensions .",
    "the planck mass is an artifact , given by @xmath66 .",
    "although the idea that extra dimensions are just around the corner  either on the submillimeter scale or on the tev scale  is preposterous , it is not ruled out by observations .",
    "for that reason alone , we should entertain ourselves by entertaining the consequences .",
    "many authors have considered the gravitational excitation of a tower of kauza ",
    "klein modes in the extra dimensions , which would give rise to a missing ( transverse ) energy signature in collider experiments.@xcite we call these excitations _ provatons , _ after the greek word for a sheep in a flock . and @xmath67 .",
    "]    `` large '' extra dimensions present us with new ways to think about the exponential range of yukawa couplings .",
    "arkani - hamed , schmaltz , and collaborators@xcite have speculated that if the standard - model brane has a small thickness , the wave packets representing different fermion species might have different locations within the extra dimension . on this picture , the yukawa couplings measure the overlap in the extra dimensions of the left - handed and right - handed wave packets and the higgs field , presumed pervasive .",
    "exponentially large differences might then arise from small offsets in the new coordinate(s ) .",
    "true or not , it is a completely different way of looking at an important problem .",
    "in the standard electroweak theory , the charged - current interactions may be represented as @xmath68 where the ( cabibbo  kobayashi ",
    "maskawa@xcite ) quark - mixing matrix is @xmath69 within the framework of the standard model , the elements of @xmath70 originate in the yukawa couplings of the quarks to the higgs field ; accordingly , they offer a link to physics beyond the standard model . for three generations of quarks ,",
    "the mixing matrix depends on three real angles and one phase ; the phase is the source of  violation.@xcite    the quark - mixing matrix is unitary : @xmath71 .",
    "consequently the product of any row or column of the matrix with the complex conjugate of another must vanish . for a @xmath72 matrix , each such equation",
    "may be depicted as a closed triangle in the complex plane .",
    "there are six distinct unitarity triangles.@xcite in a convenient parametrization,@xcite we can express the quark - mixing matrix in terms of three real quantities and one imaginary quantity as @xmath73 the phases lie in the extreme off - diagonal elements ; they are designated by @xmath74 a third angle is defined by the triangle constraint @xmath75 .    one way to characterize the task of testing the hypothesis that all  violation ( among the known particles ) arises from the phase in the quark - mixing matrix is to try to overconstrain the unitarity triangle(s ) , by measuring the sides and angles in many different ways .",
    "the @xmath76 triangle is shown twice in figure [ fig : triangles ] . on the left , i show the triangle schematically , and indicate the kinds of measurements that give us information about the various sides and angles .",
    "on the right , i show a summary of what we currently know about the shape of the @xmath76 triangle.@xcite the sources of our knowledge were reviewed in frascati by ahmed ali,@xcite guido martinelli,@xcite , and gerhard buchalla@xcite .",
    "our most important objectives for the near future are the measurements of the quantity @xmath77 in @xmath78 decays and the rate of @xmath79 mixing , and pushing on to measure the rates for the _ rarissime _ decays @xmath80 and @xmath81 .    before leaving these generalities ,",
    "i want to offer a few comments about  violation and the matter asymmetry of the universe .",
    "we learned long ago from andrei sakharov@xcite that three criteria must be fulfilled to generate a matter asymmetry in a universe that begins from neutral initial conditions .",
    "we require    1 .   microscopic  violation , such as christenson , _ et al .",
    "first observed in the decay @xmath82.@xcite 2 .",
    "baryon- ( lepton- ) number violating processes , of the kind implied by unified theories of the strong , weak , and electromagnetic interactions .",
    "3 .   a universe that evolves out of thermal equilibrium during baryogenesis , a condition natural in the hot big - bang scenario",
    "according to our current understanding of baryogenesis,@xcite the observed baryon excess in the universe , characterized by the baryon - to - photon ratio @xmath83 , can not be reproduced within the standard model by the  violation that arises from the quark - mixing phase .",
    "it is just barely possible to generate the observed baryon density at the electroweak scale within the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model , but this requires that the lightest higgs boson lie within reach of lep experiments , @xmath84 , _ and _ that the lighter top squark be less massive than the top quark , @xmath85 .",
    "these two requirements do not yet conflict with experiment , but it is likely that we need new sources of violation to account for the matter excess . it is important that we speak precisely when we tell the world what we expect to learn from the detailed study of  violation in the @xmath86 mesons : it is unlikely that we shall unlock the secrets of primordial baryogenesis , although the increased understanding we gain into  violation in the quark sector may give us new insights into what it would take to explain the matter excess .",
    "we should not promise what we do not expect to deliver !",
    "the most significant result of this year for the study of   violation is the conclusion from the ktev experiment at fermilab and the na48 experiment at cern that  invariance is violated directly in the decay @xmath82 .",
    "let us recall for a moment the phenomenological setting of these new experimental results .    in a -invariant theory ,",
    "we can write the neutral kaons of definite mass and lifetime as @xmath88 if  invariance holds , then @xmath89 , and @xmath90 is a  eigenstate with   @xmath91 . a small  impurity can be represented by the parameter @xmath24 , through the connection @xmath92 the observed @xmath82 decay rate fixes @xmath93 .",
    "a direct  violation in the decay amplitude leads to unequal rates for the charged and neutral decay modes that is expressed through the parameter @xmath94 , as@xcite @xmath95 the parameter @xmath24 , which measures the -impurity in the @xmath96 and @xmath97 states , arises in the standard model from box diagrams , whereas the parameter @xmath98 , which measures direct  violation , arises from penguin diagrams . in the standard model , @xmath99 ; in the superweak phenomenology,@xcite @xmath100 .",
    "a comparison of the charged and neutral decay rates yields a measure of @xmath101 as @xmath102 the decisive new results on @xmath103 reported within the past year are    [ cols=\"^ , < \" , ]     [ tab : hcs2b ]    i refer to miquel s talk for the capabilities of these experiments to measure @xmath104 , @xmath105 , and other quantities .",
    "as the new hadron collider experiments prepare , the extremely challenging ( fixed - target ) hera-@xmath86 experiment gives a preview of lhc - like running conditions.@xcite      after several years of publishing ever smaller upper bounds to the branching ratio for the rare decay @xmath106 , the cleo collaboration now reports the definitive observation of this potentially important mode.@xcite the branching fraction @xmath107 is smaller than hoped , which will complicate both the observation and the interpretation of  violation in the @xmath108 channel .",
    "cleo has also reported the first observation , at about the @xmath109 level , of the rare decays @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "cleo has also made a new measurement of @xmath112 mixing , determining @xmath113 in excellent agreement with the world average .",
    "finally , to search for unexpected sources of  violation that might be needed to account for the baryon number of the universe , cleo has looked for -violating asymmetries in eight rare decays .",
    "the experimental uncertainties are larger than the asymmetries expected if the phase of the quark - mixing matrix is the source of the  violation , and no significant asymmetries are observed .",
    "i should perhaps entitle this paragraph , `` babar and belle are here ! '' , for kek - b and belle and pep - ii and babar have completed their construction and commissioning in very rapid and impressive fashion .",
    "the performance of these two asymmetric @xmath86 factories and their detectors , summarized here at da@xmath0ne99 by ida peruzzi,@xcite has been inspiring , and gladdens the heart of every particle physicist .",
    "both experiments are already producing quasi - physics plots , and we can reasonably hope for new physics by the 2000 summer conferences .",
    "the pep - ii collider@xcite has already reached half its design luminosity , with @xmath114 the babar detector has already logged more than @xmath115 , and the experimenters will try to accumulate @xmath116 by next summer .",
    "the pep - ii designers are planning for a threefold luminosity increase in 2002 , and are beginning to work toward a tenfold increase in 2005 .",
    "the kek - b machine has also made a good beginning,@xcite and luminosity is improving there .",
    "the plan at kek is now to run belle continuously for about ten months .",
    "one of the outstanding recent results was the observation at brookhaven of the first candidate ",
    "a superb candidate , at that  for the rare decay @xmath118 in experiment 787.@xcite as i wrote at the time , `` what is most impressive to me is not the one beautiful candidate event , but the extremely low level of background : the event occurs on an empty field.''@xcite given the sensitivity at the time , that one event led to a branching fraction @xmath119 , consistent with the standard - model expectation@xcite of @xmath120 , but tantalizingly large . as we heard in frascati from takahiro sato,@xcite a trebled data set has led to no new candidate events , still with an admirable absence of background near the signal region .",
    "the new ( and preliminary ) branching fraction is @xmath121 which could hardly agree better with the standard model .    because of the clean theoretical interpretation of the @xmath80 mode and its potential sensitivity to new physics",
    ", it is clearly of interest to subject the standard model to a more incisive test .",
    "there are plans at brookhaven for an evolution of e787 to a project known as e949 , which promises a single - event sensitivity @xmath122 , with an expected background of 0.7 event . by adding the kinematic region below the @xmath12 line , the e949 experimenters project an ultimate sensitivity @xmath123.@xcite an experiment currently under study at fermilab as an r&d project , ckm , aims for a 10% measurement of @xmath124.@xcite    the neutral analogue decay , @xmath81 , for which the standard - model branching fraction is @xmath125,@xcite directly measures the altitude @xmath126 of the @xmath76 unitarity triangle .",

    "brookhaven has approved , but not yet secured funding for , e926 , or kopio , which would record about 50 events at the standard - model rate.@xcite at fermilab , the next phase of the ktev program would be the kami ( kaons at the main injector ) experiment , currently an r&d project.@xcite its goal is a 10% measurement of @xmath126 and sensitivity to other rare decays at the @xmath128 level.@xcite    both @xmath129 and @xmath10 experiments are fantastically challenging , but they promise indispensable tets of the three - generation electroweak theory.@xcite to balance the world s research portfolio  so heavily invested in the @xmath86 sector  we need to pursue the @xmath130 channels vigorously .",
    "the electric dipole moment of a particle or structure is defined in terms of its charge distribution @xmath131 as @xmath132 which must be directed along ( or opposite to ) the spin direction @xmath133 , because the spin is the only directional reference the particle carries . under the action of a parity inversion , , the electric dipole moment is reversed ( @xmath134 ) , while the spin ( pseudo)vector is unchanged ( @xmath135 ) . under time reversal , , the electric dipole moment is unchanged ( @xmath136 ) , while the spin direction is reversed ( @xmath137 ) .",
    "accordingly , the persistent electric dipole moment must vanish unless both and are violated .",
    "a nonvanishing electric dipole moment therefore implies violation and , in a -invariant world ,  violation .",
    "since the discovery of  violation in @xmath10 decays in 1964 , the neutron electric dipole moment has been the target of many experiments , first with neutron beams and later with ultracold neutrons.@xcite as mike pendlebury reminded us,@xcite the experimental upper bounds have dropped steadily , sweeping away a number of theoretical speculations . whether or not persistent electric dipole moments exist , we can be grateful for the persistent experimenters who are hunting them down .",
    "an improved limit reported this year from the institut laue - langevin , grenoble,@xcite @xmath138 is still about six orders of magnitude greater than the standard - model expectation , but menaces multi  higgs - boson models for  violation , and approaches the predictions of supersymmetric models .",
    "the ill group anticipates an improvement by a factor of 3 over about three years ; an improvement by two orders of magnitude may be possible over a decade .",
    "the past decade has brought remarkable progress in the search for an electric dipole moment of the electron .",
    "the most sensitive measurement is obtained using the amplification of @xmath139 in atomic thallium,@xcite @xmath140 which leads to an upper limit of @xmath141 that is impressive in absolute terms , but  because of the electron s small mass  at least ten orders of magnitude greater than the range predicted in the standard model .",
    "the good news , of course , is that a lot of terrain is open for an important discovery .",
    "a new technique using the ybf molecule to amplify the effect of @xmath139 may lead to a tenfold increase in sensitivity over three years , and perhaps another order of magnitude beyond that is in prospect .",
    "the current published limit on the muon s electric dipole moment dates to the classic @xmath142 experiment at cern.@xcite that number , @xmath143 should be improved by about a factor of twenty in the @xmath142 experiment under way at brookhaven.@xcite a proposed dedicated experiment at brookhaven@xcite could improve the sensitivity to @xmath144 that would be as sensitive , in relative terms , as the current limit on the electron s electric dipole moment , since we expect @xmath145 .",
    "the observation of lepton flavor violation would be a clear sign of physics beyond the standard electroweak theory .",
    "high - sensitivity experiments provide access to high mass scales for the particles that might mediate lepton flavor violation .",
    "although these two facts are reason enough to pursue the search for lepton flavor violation , the experimental evidence for neutrino oscillations has renewed interest in lfv searches , although it must be said that the connection is highly model dependent.@xcite    for more than four decades , the upper bounds on a variety of lepton - flavor - violating decay modes have decreased by a factor of ten every seven years.@xcite in the realm of kaon physics , the decay @xmath146 is sensitive to axial and pseudoscalar lfv operators , while the decays @xmath147 and @xmath148 probe vector and scalar lfv operators .",
    "brookhaven experiment e871 s current limit on the purely leptonic decay mode,@xcite @xmath149 is the smallest limit on the branching fraction of a hadron .",
    "experiment e865 at brookhaven has improved its limit on the @xmath150 branching fraction to @xmath151 with five times more data accumulated in 1998 , they project a 90%-cl sensitivity of @xmath152 .",
    "the corresponding neutral - kaon branching fraction , reported by fermilab experiment e799 ( ktev),@xcite is @xmath153    many experiments have now used natural sources of neutrinos , neutrino radiation from fission reactors , and neutrino beams generated in particle accelerators to look for evidence of neutrino oscillation .",
    "the positive indications for neutrino oscillations fall into three classes:@xcite    1 .",
    "five solar - neutrino experiments report deficits with respect to the predictions of the standard solar model : kamiokande and super - kamiokande using water - cherenkov techniques , sage and gallex using chemical recovery of germanium produced in neutrino interactions with gallium , and homestake using radiochemical separation of argon produced in neutrino interactions with chlorine .",
    "these results suggest the oscillation @xmath154 , with @xmath155 and @xmath156 , or @xmath157 and @xmath158 .",
    "five atmospheric - neutrino experiments report anomalies in the arrival of muon neutrinos : kamiokande , imb , and super - kamiokande using water - cherenkov techniques , and soudan ii and macro using sampling calorimetry .",
    "the most striking result is the zenith - angle dependence of the @xmath159 rate reported last year by super - k @xcite .",
    "these results suggest the oscillation @xmath160 , with @xmath161 and @xmath162 .",
    "the lsnd experiment @xcite reports the observation of @xmath163-like events is what should be an essentially pure @xmath164 beam produced at the los alamos meson physics facility , suggesting the oscillation @xmath165 .",
    "this result has not yet been reproduced by any other experiment .",
    "the favored region lies along a band from @xmath166 to @xmath167 .",
    "a host of experiments have failed to turn up evidence for neutrino oscillations in the regimes of their sensitivity .",
    "these results limit neutrino mass - squared differences and mixing angles . in more than a few cases ,",
    "positive and negative claims are in conflict , or at least face off against each other . over the next five years , many experiments will seek to verify , further quantify , and extend these claims .",
    "groups at berkeley , brookhaven , cern , fermilab , and kek are investigating the feasibility of using muon decay rings as intense neutrino sources .",
    "studies directed toward the eventual construction of @xmath168 colliders suggest that it may be possible to accumulate approximately a millimole of muons per year .",
    "what is a bug for the muon colliders  the decay @xmath169becomes a feature for a neutrino factory . with a stored muon beam with an energy of tens of gev , it may be practical to illuminate a distant detector virtually anywhere on earth and to have an event rate useful for oscillation studies.@xcite under rather special circumstances , it may be possible to observe  violation in neutrino oscillations.@xcite the prospect of intense high - energy beams of electron neutrinos and antineutrinos is very intriguing .",
    "for now , the principal questions are whether a neutrino factory is feasible and whether it is the right instrument to address the next - generation questions in neutrino mass and mixing .",
    "i expect useful first - order answers to these questions within a year .      about a year ago , the cplear collaboration at cern reported on the first observation of time - reversal symmetry violation through a comparison of the probabilities for @xmath170 oscillations as a function of the neutral - kaon proper time.@xcite the strangeness of the neutral kaon at the moment of its creation , @xmath171 , was tagged by observing the kaon charge in the formation reaction @xmath172 at rest , while the strangeness of the neutral kaon at the time of its semileptonic decay , @xmath173 , was tagged by the charge of the final - state lepton .",
    "the time - average decay - rate asymmetry , measured over the interval @xmath174 , is @xmath175 this asymmetry is a direct manifestation of -violation:@xcite if is a good symmetry in semileptonic decays and the @xmath176 rule is exact , then the observed asymmetry ( [ eq : cplear ] ) is identical to @xmath177 where @xmath178 is a probability for strangeness oscillation .",
    "the observed result is in good agreement with the theoretical expectation , @xmath179 .    at the same time , the ktev collaboration at fermilab reported their observation of a large -odd effect in @xmath180 examples of the formerly rare @xmath181 decay mode.@xcite an asymmetry of @xmath182 is seen in the angular distribution between the @xmath183 and @xmath184 decay planes , in the @xmath10 rest frame .",
    "this is the largest integrated -violating effect yet observed , and is in excellent agreement with theoretical predictions.@xcite    in frascati we learned that the na48 collaboration has now identified @xmath185 @xmath181 events and observed the expected -odd asymmetry of about @xmath186.@xcite in a -invariant world , the observation of this -odd correlation would constitute direct evidence for noninvariance .",
    "however , the right sort of violation could induce an asymmetry in the angular correlation without the need to invoke violation.@xcite      because the standard - model contributions to @xmath187 mixing and to  violation in @xmath188 decays are so minute , there are many opportunities to observe new physics.@xcite the large number of fully reconstructed charmed mesons available in cleo , the lep experiments , and fermilab fixed - target experiments make possible incisive searches , reviewed here by jeff appel.@xcite we can now contemplate experiments to reconstruct @xmath189 charms , and it is worth thinking about how to pursue those opportunities . in particular , with fermilab s 800-gev fixed - target program at an end , we need to consider how to exploit dedicated @xmath86 experiments for charm .",
    "a novel possibility , recently noticed , is that a 4-kg - year exposure at a neutrino factory could lead to a tagged sample of a million semileptonic @xmath188 decays .",
    "there is much work in progress on other rare  and formerly rare ",
    "kaon decays .",
    "na48 has used 74 examples of the double - dalitz decay @xmath190 to verify the -odd assignment of @xmath10.@xcite let us note their plan for a future intense @xmath9 beam , with a goal of measuring the -violation parameter @xmath191 in the @xmath192 decay rate . as for ktev,@xcite they have lowered the upper bounds @xmath193 and @xmath194 to near the background levels .",
    "they hope to triple their rare - decay data sets in current running . for other evidence of progress on rare and radiative decays ,",
    "see the talks by dambrosio@xcite and kettell.@xcite      finally , we heard brief reports on searches for violations of invariance and failures of quantum mechanics in kaon decays.@xcite we need to test these fundamental elements of physical theory , but it is difficult to know how to characterize deviations and what constitutes a viable theoretical framework.@xcite i would caution that the link between string theory and observable deviations from quantum mechanics and invariance is metaphorical at best .",
    "it seems to me just slightly delusional to believe that in looking for violations of and quantum mechanics one is testing the essentials of string theory in any direct way .",
    "the physics of  violation and rare decays is in an exciting state : we have new results to consider , we eagerly anticipate incisive new information in the near future , and we have ambitious long - term prospects .",
    "babar and belle , which are running now , and cdf and d , which will run again in about a year , are ready to produce important results on @xmath86 mixing and decays .",
    "the physics of neutrino masses , neutrino oscillations , and lepton flavor violation will soon join the physics of quark mixing as we seek to define and address the problem of identity . beginning next year",
    ", we expect great things from kloe on  violation and rare decays , and we wish da@xmath0ne  a long and rich life !",
    "i wish to compliment our hosts and organizers for the rich and varied program that brought many of us together for the first time , and for our warm reception in frascati .",
    "i particularly want to acknowledge the hospitality of giorgio capon , franco fabbri , lia pancheri , juliette lee - franzini , and paolo franzini .",
