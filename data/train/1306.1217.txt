    "the spectral and photometric imaging receiver ( spire ; * ? ? ? * ) , is one of the three instruments on the _ herschel _ space observatory @xcite .",
    "it has separate photometric and spectroscopic imaging sub - instruments that take advantage of _ herschel s _ capabilities for submillimetre observations .",
    "the photometer has three individual arrays of feedhorn - coupled bolometers using neutron transmutation doped ( ntd ) germanium thermistors @xcite cooled to approximately 0.3 k by an internal helium-3 refrigerator .",
    "the arrays cover three broad passbands centered at approximately 250 , 350 and 500  @xmath3 m and contain 139 , 88 , and 43 bolometers , respectively .",
    "the photometer is primarily used in a scan map mode that produces images in a single observation ranging from @xmath4 arcmin to several square degrees .    a flux calibration method appropriate for broadband submillimetre photometric instruments",
    "is described in griffin et al .",
    "( 2013 , submitted ) .",
    "this method involves the conversion of linearised bolometer voltage signals to monochromatic flux densities or sky surface brightness values using measurements of a calibration standard and knowledge of the relevant instrument properties .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to describe the detailed implementation of this flux calibration scheme in the case of the spire photometer .",
    "the resulting parameters describing the calibration curves are used by the flux conversion module within the spire photometer data processing pipeline @xcite .",
    "section  [ s_equations ] gives an overview of the equations ( including non - linearity corrections ) describing the conversion of the measured bolometer output voltage to flux density .",
    "section  [ s_calstandard ] provides information on the use of neptune as the primary flux standard , including the calculation of the neptune flux density .",
    "descriptions of the observations that were performed to derive the terms in the flux calibration equations are given in section  [ s_obsoverview ] , and sections  [ s_curve ] and [ s_scale ] provide details on the analysis used to derive the calibration parameters for every bolometer in the spire photometer arrays .",
    "separate calibration terms are derived for the two standard bias voltage settings used for photometer observations : the nominal settings ( used for most observations ) which are optimised for sources fainter than 200  jy beam@xmath0 , and the bright source settings , which are intended to be used for sources brighter than 200  jy beam@xmath0 .",
    "a discussion of problematic bolometers and how they were handled is given in section  [ s_probbolom ] .",
    "sources of uncertainty in the flux calibration curves are discussed in section  [ s_unc ] , while section  [ s_test ] describes tests of the derived flux calibration curves using observations of primary and secondary calibration sources .",
    "section  [ s_summary ] provides a detailed summary of the results from the assessment of the flux calibration . throughout this paper ,",
    "individual bolometers are referred to by their spire array designations psw , pmw , and plw for photometer ( short , medium , and long ) wavelength ( with the wavelength corresponding to 250 , 350 , and 500  @xmath3 m , respectively ) followed by row letter and column number ( e.g. , pswe2 ) .",
    "the spire detectors , being bolometers , respond not to the absorbed photon rate but to the amount of power that they absorb . as noted by griffin et al .",
    "( 2013 , submitted ) , the absorbed power is proportional to the spectral response function ( srf ) weighted flux density , which is the flux density weighted by the overall srf and integrated across the passband .",
    "this is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the srf and @xmath7 is the aperture efficiency .",
    "the spire photometer srfs , which were measured by fourier transform spectroscopy , are shown in figure 7 of griffin et al .",
    "( 2013 , submitted ) and in the spire observers manual @xcite , and they are also available in tabular form within the herschel interactive processing environment ( hipe ; * ? ? ? * ) .    for ntd bolometers ,",
    "the small - signal responsivity ( variation of output voltage with absorbed radiant power ) depends on the total voltage across the bolometer in a manner which is approximately linear over a wide range of background loading and bath temperature conditions @xcite the relation between a small change in the in - beam srf - weighted flux density , @xmath8 , and the corresponding change in the voltage across the bolometer , @xmath9 , can be expressed as @xmath10 where @xmath11 is allowed to depart from linearity .",
    "we find that the differential responsivity for the spire bolometers can be well represented by @xmath12 as is demonstrated in section [ s_curve_derivation ] . in this equation , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15",
    "are constants specific to each bolometer in each bias voltage setting .",
    "@xmath13 has units of jy v@xmath0 , @xmath14 has units of jy , and @xmath15 has units of v. the conversion between a measured voltage @xmath16 and the corresponding srf - weighted flux density is obtained from the integral of @xmath11 given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the operating point voltage ( the signal that would be measured when viewing dark sky ) and @xmath16 is the measured voltage .",
    "the result of this integral is @xmath19    the spire calibration scheme is thus based on deriving the @xmath20-parameters that describe @xmath11 . for calibration of @xmath11 , the photometer internal calibration source ( pcal",
    "* ) is used to provide a repeatable small change in power illuminating the detector .",
    "the inverse of the corresponding detector response , @xmath21 , for a given bolometer voltage , @xmath22 , is directly proportional to @xmath11 .",
    "the relation can be written as @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant .",
    "the shape of the function @xmath11 can thus be determined by observing changes in the signal from uniform pcal flashes while varying the effective bolometer operating point voltage @xmath22 .",
    "this could be done by changing the temperature of the helium-3 bath , but for spire , it is more straightforward to vary @xmath22 by viewing regions with different in - beam flux densities",
    ". it is important to note that in this exercise that the flux density does not actually need to be known ; the purpose of exposing the detector to a range of source brightnesses is merely to vary the operating point voltage of the detectors over the range of interest so as to characterise @xmath11 .",
    "having determined the shape of @xmath11 from these pcal measurements , the absolute value of the constant @xmath24 can be found from observations of a source with a known srf - weighted flux density , which then allows for determining the numerical values of the @xmath20-parameters .",
    "following equation  [ e_srffluxdensity ] , the srf - weighted flux density for a calibration source with a spectrum @xmath25 is given by @xmath26,\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is a correction factor for possible partial resolution of the calibrator by the telescope beam .",
    "the equation relating the srf - weighted flux density of the calibration source , @xmath28 , to the scaling term @xmath24 can be written as @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the voltage measured when the bolometer is pointed at the calibrator and @xmath31 is the voltage measured off - source .",
    "after determining the @xmath20-parameters in this way , the measured srf - weighted flux density for an unknown source can be found from the corresponding measured bolometer voltage .",
    "conversion of the srf - weighted flux density to a monochromatic flux density requires a choice of the frequency @xmath32 at which the flux density is to be calculated , knowledge of the instrument srf , an assumption concerning the source spectral shape , and the stipulation that the source and calibrator have the same spatial characteristics to ensure that the conversion from in - beam flux density to absorbed detector power is the same for the source and calibration observations .",
    "when adopting a point - like source as the calibrator , as is the case for spire , it is also appropriate to quote source flux densities based on the assumption that the source is also point - like .    the convention adopted for _ herschel _ is to quote monochromatic flux density values under the assumption that @xmath33 ) is constant ( i.e. the spectral index @xmath34 is -1 ) .",
    "the conversion between the srf - weighted flux density and the monochromatic flux density @xmath35 is given by griffin et al .",
    "( 2013 , submitted ) as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is computed for @xmath38 and the chosen value of @xmath32 using @xmath39 values for @xmath37 and the wavelengths @xmath40 corresponding to @xmath41 are given in table  [ t_kmonp ] .",
    ".values of @xmath37 [ cols=\"<,^,^ \" , ]     @xmath42 these flux densities include no colour corrections .",
    "+ @xmath43 these values are calculated by fitting lines to the measured / model ratios for the small scan map data and then calculating the difference in the best fitting line between od 100 and od 1450 .",
    "gamma dra is much fainter than neptune and uranus , so the measurements show more dispersion , particularly at 350 and 500  @xmath3 m . unlike the neptune and uranus data , no statistically - significant differences are seen between the large and small scan map measurements .",
    "however , the 0.5% effects seen for neptune would be undetectable in the gamma dra data with its lower signal - to - noise ratio . the gamma dra timeline data exhibit relatively more scatter near the peak of the source than the neptune or uranus timeline data , so it is also possible that minor coverage differences between the small and large scan map measurements do not significantly affect the function fit to the data .",
    "the parallel mode measurements show no statistically - significant difference from the large and small scan map measurements , although one of the fast scan speed parallel map measurements at 500  @xmath3 m is @xmath44 lower than the median measured in other data ( probably because of the lower signal - to - noise ratio in these data and the faintness of the source at 500  @xmath3 m ) .",
    "we did not measure any statistically significant change in any of the data between od 100 and od 1450 .",
    "the gamma dra data may lack the sensitivity needed to detect the @xmath45% decrease in detector response that may be implied by the neptune data .",
    "however , the measured increase of 0.5% in the 250  @xmath3 m data is @xmath46 greater than the expected 0.7% decrease .",
    "this suggests that the change in the neptune and uranus measured / model flux density ratios at 250  @xmath3 m may actually be related to issues with modelling temporal changes in flux densities for the planets , although the evidence for this is tenuous .",
    "we have outlined the methods by which neptune is used as the primary flux standard for the _ herschel_-spire photometer , including a detailed assessment of the overall error budget associated with transferring the neptune calibration to an unknown point source .    the flux calibration for all individual bolometers has been thoroughly assessed .",
    "the relative uncertainties are typically @xmath1% for most bolometers in both calibration modes . however , because of the problems with the truncated signal during the neptune observations , the uncertainties for some individual bolometers in the nominal bias mode are @xmath2% .",
    "the primary assessment of the flux calibration uncertainties for each array as a whole is based on the neptune data .",
    "we were able to measure the flux density of neptune to within 1.5% of the model flux density in all three bands and using both voltage bias modes .",
    "this uncertainty includes both the systematic offset between the measured and model flux densities and the @xmath47 dispersion in the measurements .",
    "as all neptune data were used to calculate this uncertainty , it encompasses any possible temporal changes in the detector sensitivity during the mission and any variability in the brightness of neptune not accounted for by the models , although the evidence for either is inconclusive .",
    "the uncertainty also includes the variations in measurements between different observing modes , which is mainly a consequence of minor differences in the coverage .",
    "we therefore conclude that 1.5% can be adopted as the relative calibration uncertainty for the spire photometer arrays .",
    "the overall error budget must also include the 4% absolute uncertainty ascribed to the neptune model , and any statistical or other uncertainties associated with a particular measurement .",
