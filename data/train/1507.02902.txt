    "in the space surrounding two bodies that orbit about their mutual mass center there are five points where a third body will remain in equilibrium under the gravitational attraction of the other two bodies .",
    "these points are called lagrangian points in honour of joseph lagrange , who discovered them in 1772 while studying the restricted problem formed by the sun - jupiter system .",
    "the discovery of their physical realization , i.e. the trojan group of asteroids , began only in 1906 thanks to the astronomer max wolf with the first - seen member of this group , 588 achilles , which is located near the triangular libration point of the sun - jupiter system .",
    "today we know that there are @xmath3 known trojans at the triangular lagrangian point @xmath0 and @xmath4 at @xmath1 @xcite . in the sixties , simultaneously with the increased interest in space explorations , the question of existence of lagrangian points with respect to other primaries , especially for the earth - moon system , arose quite naturally .",
    "in fact , if there are stable stationary solutions for various primary combinations , then from a practical point of view placing observational platforms at these points becomes feasible , especially in a really close and accessible system like the earth - moon system , which is also the most convenient system from an economic point of view .",
    "while the sun - jupiter system clearly possesses a collection of asteroids at the triangular libration points , the ability of the earth - moon system to collect debris or dust at the corresponding points and in what is called kordylewski clouds is still in question ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for further details ) . the major perturbing effect on the trojans",
    "is represented by saturn , while the stabilizing forces come from the sun and jupiter .",
    "the major perturbation on the earth - moon libration clouds is the sun and the stabilizing effects are derived from the earth and the moon .",
    "this explains why the existence of accumulated material at @xmath0 or @xmath1 in the earth - moon system is not so obvious .",
    "bodies at the triangular libration points of the system consisting of the sun and another planet would face the perturbations from jupiter ; therefore , it is not surprising that the only currently known material accumulation is confined to the sun - jupiter system , although some asteroids were found also in the sun - earth system around the libration point @xmath0 , as is shown by recent observations @xcite . as far as the collinear lagrangian points for the earth - moon system are concerned , we know that @xmath5 allows comparatively easy access to lunar and earth orbits with minimal change in velocity and has this as an advantage to position a half - way manned space station intended to help transport cargo and personnel to the moon and backwards , whereas @xmath6 would be a good location for a communications satellite covering the moon s far side and would be an ideal location for a propellant depot as part of the proposed depot - based space transportation architecture @xcite .    recently , inspired by the works in refs .",
    "@xcite on effective field theories of gravity , some of us @xcite have applied this theoretical analysis to the macroscopic bodies occurring in celestial mechanics @xcite , especially in the earth - moon system .",
    "it has been demonstrated that in the quantum regime , when only the interaction potential is modified in the lagrangian of newtonian gravity , the position of collinear lagrangian points is governed by four algebraic ninth degree equations , which reduce to two algebraic fifth degree equations in the classical regime , while the quantum corrected position of the noncollinear libration points is described in terms of a pair of quintic equations , which predict that the classical equilateral triangle picture is no longer valid in the quantum scheme .",
    "for the earth - moon system , the prediction about the discrepancy between classical and quantum corrected quantities is of the order of millimeters .",
    "this magnitude is comparable with the instrumental accuracy of point - to - point laser time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements in space typical of the modern satellite / lunar laser ranging ( slr / llr ) techniques @xcite ) .",
    "the full positioning error budget of the orbits of satellites equipped with laser retroreflectors and reconstructed by laser ranging depends also on other sources of uncertainty ( related to the specific orbit , satellite and retroreflector array ) , in addition to the pure point - to - point laser tof instrumental accuracy ( related to the network of laser ranging ground stations of the ilrs , i.e. , the international laser ranging service @xcite .",
    "the full positioning error budget can be larger than millimeters .",
    "this is an interesting potentiality , because we are dealing with predictions which might become testable in the earth - moon system .",
    "this is a novel feature in the theory of quantum gravity , because all other theories are so far unable to produce testable effects @xcite .",
    "these predictions become more realistic if we include the perturbations due to the gravitational presence of the sun , in other words we have to face up the restricted problem of four bodies , consisting of the sun , the earth and the moon as the three primaries and the fourth body ( e.g. a laser - ranged test mass , a spacecraft or by exploiting the solar sail technology @xcite ) which has an infinitesimal mass , to avoid affecting the motion of the primaries . as we know , in the restricted three - body problem the motion of the two primaries is exactly described by the equations of motion governing the two - body problem . therefore , we may generalize the problem first by solving the dynamical equations describing the motion of the three primaries and then by finding the motion of the planetoid in the presumably known gravitational field produced by the primaries . since no closed - form solution is known for the full three - body problem , this generalization to the case of four bodies is rather difficult . a practicable possibility",
    "consists in assuming the motions of the three primaries and , without attempting to establish the exact solution of the equations governing these motions , accept an approximate solution .",
    "such an approximation may be , for instance , that the earth and the moon move in elliptic orbits around their mass center and that the mass center of the earth - moon system , in turn , moves in elliptic orbit around the sun .",
    "the plane of the orbit of the mass center of the earth - moon system , which is called the plane of ecliptic , is inclined relative to the plane containing the orbits of the earth and the moon .",
    "a simpler approximation would consist in neglecting the eccentricity of all orbits , i.e. assuming that the earth , the moon and their mass center have circular orbits . under these assumptions , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite did show that , although it is widely accepted that , with the introduction of the sun , the points @xmath0 and @xmath1 of the earth - moon system cease to be equilibrium points , stable motion may be possible in a region around these noncollinear libration points .",
    "the term `` stable '' here indicates that the planetoid will remain within a certain region for the period of time during which the motion is studied . the work in ref .",
    "@xcite demonstrated that a spacecraft moves on a trajectory around the stable libration points for at least @xmath2 days before the solar influence causes it to move through wide departures from the lagrangian points .",
    "indeed , from the analysis of the plots it does not appear that , after @xmath2 days , a limiting value for the envelope is approached . it would be interesting to recover this feature directly from the solution of the dynamical equations ( if they were known ) , since at the present state we believe that the form of the equations involved ( see sec .",
    "ii ) does not allow , by itself , such a deduction .",
    "the first purpose of our paper consists in showing that this is true also if we assume the quantum corrected potential discovered in refs .",
    "@xcite , and secs . ii and iii",
    "are devoted to this topic .",
    "all the considerations made in these sections represent the natural extension of our previous papers , as we continue to describe the three - body problem in the context of effective field theories of gravity by adding all features that would contribute to make this subject as close as possible to reality , in order to encourage the launch of future space missions that could verify the model we are proposing . on the other hand",
    ", one has to consider that general relativity is currently the most successful gravitational theory describing the nature of space and time , and well confirmed by observations .",
    "in fact , it has been brightly confirmed by all the so - called `` classical '' tests , i.e. the perihelion shift of mercury , the deflection of light and the shapiro time delay , and it has also gone through the systematic test offered by the binary pulsar system `` psr 1913 + 16 '' , since the orbit decay of this system is perfectly in accordance with the theoretical decay due to the emission of gravitational waves , as predicted by general relativity . furthermore , lagrangian points have recently attracted renewed interests for relativistic astrophysics @xcite , where the position and the stability of lagrangian points is described within the post - newtonian regime . for all these reasons , we believe that our model is incomplete without a comparison with the einstein theory .",
    "therefore , sec .",
    "iv studies all lagrangian points within the framework of general relativity , to establish the most accurate classical counterpart of the putative quantum framework that we have set up . by taking seriously into account the important role played by the einstein theory within this scheme , in the last part of this paper we describe a _ new _",
    "quantum corrected regime where the underlying classical theory is represented by general relativity , rather than newtonian theory .",
    "all the considerations made in refs .",
    "@xcite , in fact , are characterized by the fact that the classical theory for which quantum corrections are computed is the newtonian theory , instead of einstein s one .",
    "but , if general relativity is the most successful classical theory of gravitation , then we have to consider a scheme where quantum corrections to general relativity are evaluated .",
    "this topic is investigated in sec .",
    "v , where we also show that , among all quantum coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 in the long - distance corrections to the newtonian potential available in literature @xcite , the most suitable ones to describe the gravitational interactions involving ( at least ) three bodies are those connected to the bound - states potential .",
    "finally , conclusions and open problems are discussed in sec .",
    "we start by introducing the classical dynamical equations governing the motion of the planetoid in the gravitational field of the earth , the moon and the sun @xcite .",
