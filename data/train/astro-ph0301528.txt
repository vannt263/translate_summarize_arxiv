    "in our previous paper ( kiseleva - eggleton 2002 ) we applied the new technique invented by cincotta & sim ( 2000 ) and called megno ( the acronym of _ mean exponential growth factor of nearby orbits _ ) to a wide neighbourhood of orbital parameters determined using standard two - body keplerian fits for the recently discovered multi - planetary systems hd@xmath012661 , hd@xmath038529 , hd@xmath037124 , and hd@xmath0160691 in order to distinguish between regular and chaotic planetary configurations .",
    "we showed that the currently announced orbital parameters place these systems in very different situations from the point of view of dynamical stability .",
    "while hd@xmath038529 and hd@xmath037124 are located within large stability zones in the phase space around their determined orbits , the orbital parameters of the hd@xmath012661 planets are located in a border region between stable and unstable dynamical regimes , so while its currently determined orbital parameters produce stable orbits , a minor change within the margin of error of just one parameter may result in a chaotic dynamical system .",
    "the orbits in hd@xmath0160691 ( jones 2002 ) at first appeared highly unstable , but using megno we were able to identify a few stability zones in a parameter space which included the parameters not determined from observations , such as the relative inclination @xmath14 between the two planetary orbits and the longitudes of the ascending nodes @xmath15 .",
    "all these stable configurations are associated with the 2:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "the present paper is wholly devoted to a detailed and complete dynamical analysis of the hd@xmath0160691 planetary system by taking into account the angular orbital parameters not constrained by observational data ( @xmath14 , @xmath15 ) , as well as @xmath8 ( the line - of - sight inclination factor ) and the resulting different planetary masses .",
    "we have also explored the space of the mean anomalies @xmath16 of the two planets taking initially into account the time of periastron passage @xmath17 given by jones 2002 ( see table 1 ) .    in one of our earlier papers ( godziewski 2002 ) we have clearly identified ( using megno ) the exact location of the 2:1 mean motion resonance and its width for the gliese 876 planetary system . a recent study by hadjidemetriou ( 2002 ) of periodic orbits in this resonance predicts stable and unstable configurations of planetary systems depending on the hierarchy of planetary masses and eccentricities .",
    "the gliese 876 system where @xmath18 and @xmath19 is , according to this study , a stable configuration .",
    "in contrast , the hierarchies of the hd@xmath0160691 system are inverse , i.e. @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "hadjidemetriou ( 2002 ) found that a planetary system at the 2:1 resonance where the inner planet is much more massive than the outer planet is unstable for all values of the eccentricities .",
    "however , in the hd@xmath0160691 system the two planetary masses are comparable and this leaves the question about its stability open .    in this work",
    "we have explored the parameter space available for planets in hd@xmath0160691 in order to determine the stability conditions for this system .",
    "we have to notice that the orbital parameters of both planets are rather speculative due to the insufficient amount of observations , and even the existence of the second planetary companion is not yet fully confirmed ( jones 2002 , butler 2001 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the mechanism we present in this paper is probably the key to the existence of planetary systems like hd@xmath0160691 .",
    "we have clearly identified the exact location of the 2:1 mean motion resonance , its width , and the secular resonance in apsidal longitudes preserving the stability related to the mean motion resonance .",

    "a classical method that allows us to distinguish between regular and chaotic dynamical states is the method of lyapunov characteristic numbers ( lcn ) .",
    "the estimation of lcn usually requires computations over long evolutionary times , sometimes much longer than the lifetime of the system studied .",
    "let us note that _ chaotic _ in the poincar sense means that the dynamical behavior is not quasi - periodic ( the conventional definition useful for conservative dynamical systems ) , and does not necessarily mean that the system will disintegrate during any limited period of time .",
    "let us state in addition that we use the property of _ stability _ in the poisson sense  : stability is related to the preservation of a certain neighbourhood relative to the initial position of the trajectory . in conservative systems ,",
    "quasi - periodic orbits remain always confined within certain limits ; in this sense they are stable .    in the present work ,",
    "we use two different methods in order to identify the dynamical state of the hd@xmath0160691 system  : the megno and fli ( the acronym of _ fast lyapunov indicator _ ) techniques .",
    "these two methods converge faster and are more sensitive than the lcn technique .",
    "fli is the method introduced by froeschl ( 1997 ) , permitting us to distinguish qualitatively between regular and chaotic motion in a dynamical system ( see for example pilat - lohinger & dvorak 2002 ) .",
    "megno is a new method developed by cincotta & sim ( 2000 ) that we have already successfully applied to the study of dynamical stability of extrasolar planetary systems ( see e.g. godziewski 2001 , 2002 , kiseleva - eggleton 2002 ) .",
    "this method provides relevant information about the global dynamics and the fine structure of the phase space , and it yields simultaneously a good estimate of the lcn with a comparatively small computational effort ( cincotta & giordano 2000 ) .",
    "the megno is an alternative technique that proves to be efficient for investigation of both ordered and stochastic components of phase space ( cincotta , giordano & sim 2002 ) .",
    "it provides a clear picture of resonance structures , location of stable and unstable periodic orbits , as well as a measure of hyperbolicity in chaotic domains ( i.e. the rate of divergence of unstable orbits ) which coincides with that given by the lyapunov characteristic number .",
    "in order to identify the different dynamical behaviors in the parameter space , we use megno which provides the exact location of stable and unstable orbits as well as a measure of hyperbolicity .",
    "figures 1 and 2 show the dynamical state of the hd@xmath0160691 system as a function of both orbital semi - major axes @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( fig . 1 ) and eccentricities @xmath6 and @xmath25 ( fig .",
    "all other orbital parameters were taken from table 1 with the addition of values of @xmath26 and @xmath27 undetermined from observations , and with @xmath17 replaced by the corresponding calculated values of mean anomalies @xmath28 ( with an initial time of reference @xmath29 , one obtains @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) . in order to avoid a dynamical behavior bound to the plane , the two initial orbital inclinations @xmath32 and @xmath33 are taken slightly different ( @xmath13 and @xmath34 respectively ) ; due to gravitational interactions of the 3-body problem , the relative inclination @xmath14 is free to evolve in the 3-d space . in fig .",
    "2 as well as in other figures in this paper @xmath24 was taken to be 2.381 au according to the table footnote . in all our figures",
    "the intersection of horizontal and vertical lines indicates the ` observational ' initial parameters taken from table  1 . by using the megno indicator characteristic value @xmath35 ( cincotta & sim 2000 ) ,",
    "filled and open circles in fig .",
    "1a ( and all other figures plotted in 2-d in this paper ) indicate stable orbits ( @xmath36 , and @xmath37 respectively ) , while small dots ( not surrounded by circles ) indicate highly unstable orbits ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "one can see that the system is globally highly unstable , except for a clearly marked stability region .",
    "1a is a cross section of fig .",
    "1b ( plotted in 3-d ) in the plane @xmath39 with projections of the different points according to their nature . in fig . 1b",
    ", the peaks indicate the magnitude of instability .",
    "the stability strip in fig .",
    "1a corresponds to a stability valley in 3-d ( fig .",
    "however , its fine structure can not be seen in this 3-d graph because of the scale factor in the @xmath40 axis due to the high magnitude of the instability peaks .",
    "the stability strip is associated with the 2:1 mean motion resonance .",
    "generally , the presence of a resonance structures the phase or parameter space in different regions , regular and irregular ( i.e. chaotic ) . in fig . 1b",
    ", such different regions appear clearly .",
    "the regions on both sides of the stability valley present an irregular distribution of the values of @xmath35 meaning very different magnitudes of instability .",
    "the valley on the other hand presents a regular picture at the used scale , which is confirmed by the cross section ( a ) of ( b ) .",
    "the strip indeed obtained in fig .",
    "1a , composed of filled and open circles , is sufficiently homogeneous and dense to be a stability zone .",
    "it is rather wide ( @xmath41 au in both semi - major axes ) , and besides one order of magnitude larger than the one obtained for the gliese 876 planetary system ( also in 2:1 mean motion resonance , see godziewski , bois , & maciejewski , 2002 ) .",
    "however , for hd@xmath0160691 this stability valley may completely disappear for a small change in angular elements .",
    "the stability zone is indeed only permitted for a particular geometrical configuration of the orbits ( determined by the combination of the elements @xmath15 , @xmath42 , and @xmath14 ) combined with particular relative positions of the two planets on their orbits determined by the @xmath16 elements . for example , for a shift only on the @xmath43 element without losing the 2:1 mean motion resonance , close approaches at the periastron occur in the end , and consequently the dynamical behavior becomes totally and highly unstable as it is shown in figure 3 ( computed with @xmath44 instead of @xmath45 ) .",
    "the same situation appears with a comparable shift on the @xmath46 elements .",
    "for instance , with @xmath47 , 100 , or @xmath48 instead of @xmath49 , the stability valley is lost .",
    "the whole stabilizing mechanism depends on particular combinations of the elements @xmath15 , @xmath42 , @xmath14 , and @xmath16 .",
    "we will discuss these stability conditions in detail below .",
    "figure 2 shows two stability regions in the @xmath50 $ ] parameter space  : ( i ) a small one with few points where both eccentricities are small , and ( ii ) a much larger region for high values of the outer orbit ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "let us notice that in the latter , the eccentricity of the inner orbit @xmath52 is relatively unimportant when @xmath53 .",
    "let us emphasize that the large region with a sizeable number of stable points decreases significantly when @xmath24 is taken to be 2.3 instead of 2.381 au ( see fig .",
    "3d in our previous paper kiseleva - eggleton 2002 ) . in the present figure 2 , due to the resolution of the grid , the dynamical behavior of the`observational ' point in eccentricities ( table 1 ) does not appear .",
    "however , with a higher resolution ( i.e. more integration points ) , computations confirm the existence of a stable point at the intersection of the horizontal and vertical lines .",
    "in addition , few unstable points are also very close .",
    "let us recall that some zones ( notably on the sides of stability structures ) may present a sensitiveness to initial conditions for stable versus unstable points in a very close vicinity between them .",
    "this situation reminds us of the dynamical state of the hd@xmath012661 planetary system ( kiseleva - eggleton 2002 ) .",
    "figure 4 shows how the dynamical state of the hd@xmath0160691 system depends on the relative inclination @xmath54 between the planetary orbits and on the angular elements @xmath42 and @xmath15 for both planets @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in the general case of a 2-planet system ,",
    "the relative inclination @xmath54 is related to the longitudes of ascending nodes @xmath55 and @xmath56 as follows  : @xmath57 however , in our computations , for a variation of @xmath58 or @xmath59 , the inclination of the other orbit is taken equal to zero .",
    "as a consequence , @xmath60 or @xmath59 , and then the inclinations on the vertical axes of the figure 4 may be simply read as a scanning of the relative inclination @xmath54 between the orbits .",
    "it is important to remark that the distributions of structures are relatively similar in the pairs @xmath61 $ ] and @xmath62 $ ] , as well as in @xmath63 $ ] and @xmath64 $ ] , with stable orbits appearing in strips of a comparable width @xmath65 around the nominal values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 ( table 1 ) for all values of @xmath54 .",
    "there are also additional stability zones , but very narrow , for small values of @xmath68 in both maps related to @xmath42 , as well as in the two others related to @xmath15 .",
    "the nominal values for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , namely 320 and 99 degrees respectively , are located well inside the stable strips .    figures 5 and 6 present the stability maps of the @xmath71 $ ] ( where @xmath72 ) and @xmath73 $ ] parameter spaces , respectively . fig .",
    "5 shows a linear relationship between the longitudes of periastron @xmath74 and @xmath75 for stable configurations .",
    "this means that @xmath74 and @xmath75 precess at the same rate .",
    "6 shows stable strips in the mean anomaly @xmath76 $ ] plane that permit us to identify adequate relative orbital positions for stable configurations at the 2:1 resonance in mean motions .",
    "figures 5 and 6 also show that the hd@xmath0160691 planetary system is dynamically stable only when the corresponding orbital parameters are simultaneously represented by stable points inside the strips in both @xmath71 $ ] and @xmath73 $ ] planes .",
    "if only one of the two conditions is realized , the map @xmath77 $ ] exhibits a totally unstable dynamical state without any particular stability structure ( see fig .",
    "we have also computed the @xmath71 $ ] stability maps for different relative inclinations ( from 0 to @xmath78 , not shown in this paper ) , and consequently we may point out that the whole mechanism of stabilization can be successfully applied even to high relative inclinations if @xmath79 are determined in an appropriate way  : @xmath74 and @xmath75 on average precess at the same rate while the planets _ b _ and _ c _ , in 2:1 mean motion resonance , are located on their orbits in such a way that there are no close approaches at their periastron .",
    "the favourable respective positions are defined by the stable strips in the mean anomaly @xmath76 $ ] plane ( cf .",
    "the stability requires a particular geometrical configuration of the orbits ( defined by elements @xmath15 , @xmath42 , and @xmath14 ) , added to particular positions of the two planets on their orbits defined by the @xmath16 element .",
    "in addition to the 2:1 mean motion resonance , the planets _ b _ and _ c _ have to be initially located in favourable respective positions , for example at their apoapses , in order to avoid close approaches at their periapses . following analogous properties analyzed by lee & peale ( 2002 ) for the gj@xmath0876 planetary system , we have found in the hd@xmath0160691 system the simultaneous librations of the two mean motion resonance variables @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( where @xmath82 ) , while the secular resonance variable @xmath83 librates about @xmath11 with a period of about 2800 years and an amplitude of 80 degrees ( see fig . 7 ) .",
    "@xmath10 being only librating ( i.e. without secular term ) , the two orbital planes on average precess at the same rate .",
    "this is a mechanism of secular resonance in periastron , which as a consequence ensures the maintenance of the orbital topology as well as the respective motions of the planets , that is to say in the present case , the 2:1 mean motion resonance without close approaches of the planets at their periapses . in other words , this mechanism ,",
    "when combined with adequate relative positions of the planets on the initial osculating orbits , can be understood as the condition for the preservation of the dynamical stability related to the 2:1 mean motion resonance . because the two variables @xmath9 and @xmath12 librate around @xmath11 and @xmath13 , respectively ( see fig .",
    "7 ) , the lines of apsides are anti - aligned .",
    "this situation is different from the gj@xmath0876 configuration in which the apsidal lines are aligned with @xmath9 , @xmath12 , and @xmath10 all librating about @xmath13 ( lee & peale 2002 , godziewski , bois & maciejewski 2002 ) .",
    "let us note that in the familiar io - europa 2:1 resonance , the very small eccentricities lead to a geometry where @xmath9 is librating about @xmath13 , while @xmath12 and @xmath10 are librating about @xmath11 ( lee & peale 2002 ) . in this case",
    ", conjunctions occur when io is near periapse and europa near apoapse .",
    "the whole stability mechanism for the hd@xmath0160691 system allows it to avoid close approaches between planets , especially at their periapses ( or near them ) .",
    "if it is not the case , the dynamical behavior is wholly unstable since the close approaches near periapses occur regularly ( see fig . 3 where @xmath84 ) .",
    "the original orbital topology of the hd@xmath0160691 planetary system associated to the 2:1 mean motion resonance can be written as @xmath1 , which means that the planets _ c _ and _ b _ may be considered as initially located at their apoastron around the central star _ s _",
    "( state 1 ) .",
    "taking into account the 2:1 mean motion resonance , the present topology is equivalent to @xmath85  : after one revolution of the planet _",
    "b _ , the planet _",
    "c _ is at its periapse ( state 2 ) .",
    "this situation corresponds ( by taking into account the important amplitude of the secular resonance variable @xmath10 , namely @xmath86 ) to the nominal anomalies given in table 1 ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "after one revolution more of the planet _",
    "b _ , the planets are again near their apoastron ( state 1 ) . besides , with the 2nd state , we understand that the present topology may drive to a solid stability where the sum of both eccentricities is particularly important ( i.e. @xmath88 , high @xmath89 helps ) ( see fig .",
    "because of the high eccentricities of the orbits , and despite relatively small semi - major axes , the relative distances between the two planets may remain sufficiently large over the whole evolutionary time scale of the system .",
    "we have also tested the robustness of this mechanism when the values of the planetary masses were progressively increased . in figure 8 , computed by the fli technique in the @xmath77 $ ] parameter space , the two masses are consecutively multiplied by a factor @xmath90 1 ( a ) , 1.3 ( b ) , 1.4 ( c ) , 1.5 ( d ) .",
    "the total destruction of the stable structure is reached for @xmath91 , which corresponds to a line - of - sight inclination factor @xmath92 ( i.e. @xmath93 ) , as we know only the lower limit of planetary masses @xmath94 from the function @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the real mass .",
    "this result is in agreement with a numerical analysis by kiseleva - eggleton & bois ( 2001 ) of multi - planetary systems of @xmath97 and - type which showed that the dynamical regime , and consequently the lifetime of the system , depends strongly on the mass hierarchy as well as on the absolute values of planetary masses . in other words , assuming that the observed planetary system is dynamically stable , we could probably determine a window for the possible values of line - of - sight inclinations @xmath98 , and as a consequence give upper limits on the planetary masses .",
    "using the megno technique of global dynamics analysis we scanned the most relevant cases of the orbital parameter space for the hd@xmath0160691 planetary system .",
    "we have found the existence of a stability zone ruled by a mechanism which involves angular elements of the system .",
    "this stability zone is indeed due to the 2:1 mean motion resonance coupled with adequate relative positions of the planets on their orbits avoiding close approaches at their periastron , the two apsidal lines being anti - aligned .",
    "the mechanism is not lost during the dynamical evolution of the system due to an apsidal secular resonance  : the mean motion resonance variables are librating while the longitudes of periapse on average precess at the same rate .",
    "we conclude that in order to be dynamically stable , the hd@xmath0160691 planetary system has to satisfy the following conditions  : ( 1 ) a 2:1 mean motion resonance , ( 2 ) combined with an apsidal secular resonance , ( 3 ) in a configuration @xmath1 ( i.e. an apsidal antialignment ) , ( 4 ) and specific conditions on the respective sizes of the eccentricities .",
    "high eccentricity for the outer orbit ( @xmath5 ) is the most probable necessary condition , while the eccentricity of the inner orbit @xmath6 becomes relatively unimportant when @xmath7 .",
    "these four conditions , taking also into account various relative inclinations between the two orbits , determine the dynamical behavior of the system in such a way that the planets are never too close to each other . in the end ,",
    "the hd@xmath0160691 system , where the resonance variables @xmath9 and @xmath10 librate about @xmath11 while @xmath12 librates about @xmath13 , has revealed resources of the 2:1 orbital resonances that have not been observed nor analyzed before .",
    "the present orbital topology [ @xmath1 ] combined with the 2:1 orbital resonance is indeed more wide - ranging than the particular case of the hd@xmath0160691 planetary system .",
    "it is a new theoretical possibility suitable for a stable regime despite relatively small semi - major axes with respect to the important masses in interactions.82943 planetary system related to a 2:1 orbital resonance ( ji 2003 ) . ]",
    "combining our megno maps ( confirmed with the fli method ) for different pairs of parameters , it is possible to converge towards stability conditions related to different combinations of the angular parameters . as the observational determination of the elements of the hd@xmath0160691 system is far from being finalized , we hope that the maps presented here will be useful for testing both future observations and different parameter fitting techniques . in this respect , let us mention the fitting method of laughlin & chambers ( 2001 ) , suitable for resonant interactions between the planets and where the true masses can be determined by eliminating the indeterminacy in @xmath8 inherent in fits that assume independent keplerian motions .",
    "let us note here that we have already tested some of the new fits for hd@xmath0160691 obtained by eugenio rivera ( private communication ) , and found that the only stable systems with @xmath100 that do not meet our stability conditions would be ones with a very massive substellar distant companion ( @xmath101 ) on a very large orbit ( @xmath102 au ) .",
    "this type of system is very different from the systems with jupiter - mass planets on close orbits that we have discussed in this paper .",
