    "the discovery of the high-@xmath4 superconductivity in doped cuprates,@xcite observation of many unconventional properties in doped manganites with their colossal magnetoresistance , bismuthates with high-@xmath4 s , nickellates and many other oxides @xcite shows that we deal with a manifestation of novel strongly correlated states with a local charge instability , mixed valence , `` metal - dielectric '' duality , strong coupling of different ( charge , spin , orbital , structural ) degrees of freedom and non - landau behaviour of quasiparticles .",
    "all this has generated a flurry of ideas , models and scenarios of the puzzling transport phenomena and stimulated the intensive studies of various correlation effects and charge transfer ( ct ) phenomena in strongly correlated systems derived in either way from insulators unstable with regard to the ct fluctuations .",
    "conventional approach to hotly debated strongly correlated 3d oxides such as cuprates , manganites , and many other similar systems implies making use of a hubbard model with famous hamiltonian    @xmath5    with competing contributions of kinetic and potential terms . here",
    "@xmath6 are creation / annihilation operators for low - lying antibonding 3d - o 2p hybridized orbitals .",
    "the two - center charge transfer integral @xmath7 is often associated with d - d transfer .",
    "mott - hubbard insulator is believed to arise from a potentially metallic half - filled band as a result of the coulomb blockade of electron tunnelling ( @xmath8 ) to neighboring sites.@xcite    despite intense effort , the behavior of strongly correlated 3d oxides remain poorly understood and we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics .",
    "moreover , it seems that there are missing qualitative aspects of the problem beyond the simple hubbard scenario that so far escaped the identification and the recognition .",
    "firstly it concerns strong electron - lattice polarization effects which may be subdivided into electron - lattice interaction itself,@xcite and a contribution of an electronic background that is electronic subsystem which is not incorporated into effective hubbard model hamiltonian.@xcite these effects are of great importance for the ground state electronic and crystalline structure , and can seriously modify the doping response of 3d oxide up to the crucial change of the seemingly natural ground state .",
    "this question has not received the attention it deserves .",
    "it should be emphasized that traditional frhlich approach to the electron - lattice coupling implies the description of linear effects whereas the charge fluctuations in the insulator do imply strongly nonlinear electron - lattice coupling with the predominance of polarization and relaxation effects , and another energy scale .",
    "electron - lattice effects may be directly incorporated into effective hubbard model .",
    "assuming the coupling with the local displacement ( configuration ) coordinate @xmath9 in the effective potential energy we arrive at a generalized peierls - hubbard model.@xcite from the other hand , the taking account of similar effects in the kinetic energy results in a generalized su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) model.@xcite the correlation effect of an electronic background was shown @xcite to be of primary importance for atomic systems with filled or almost filled electron shells .",
    "namely such a situation is realized in oxides with o@xmath102p@xmath11 ) oxygen ions . in particular , the effect results in a correlated character of a charge transfer that seems to be one of the main features for 3d oxides .",
    "many strongly correlated 3d oxides reveal anomalous sensitivity to a small nonisovalent substitution . for example , only 2% sr@xmath12 substituted for la@xmath13 in la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 result in a dramatical suppression of long - range copper antiferromagnetism , while it is suppressed with isovalent cu@xmath12 substitution by zn@xmath12 at a much higher concentration close to the site dilution percolating threshold .",
    "simultaneously , the transport properties of la@xmath16sr@xmath17cuo@xmath18 system reveal unconventional insulator - metal duality starting from very low dopant level.@xcite most likely , all this points to a charge phase instability intrinsic for parent 214 system which somehow evolves with nonisovalent substitution due to a well developed charge potential inhomogeneity and/or hole doping effect .",
    "the problem seems to be closely related with the hidden @xmath19 intrinsic to each solid.@xcite if the ground state of a solid is pseudo - degenerate , being composed of true and false ground states with each structural and electronic orders different from others , one might call it _ multi - stable_. below we focus ourselves on a charge degree of freedom and charge ( in)stability , rather than orbital or spin degrees of freedom . as an illuminating example of such a material with _ conceptually simple _ but _ actually false _ ground state toyozawa @xcite suggests to address the wolfram s red , a quasi - one dimensional material of which the skeleton chain consists of alternate array : ( cl@xmath20 - pt@xmath13 -)@xmath21 with simple ( and seemingly metallic ) , but a false ground state .",
    "the real ground state is an insulator with a complicated structure of doubled period : ( cl@xmath22 - pt@xmath23 - cl@xmath22 - pt@xmath12-)@xmath24 , which can be reached from the former through the peierls transition with the charge density wave of large amplitude , or disproportionation like reaction .",
    "this transition can be considered as the condensation of self - decomposed self - trapped excitons spontaneously generated on all unit cells .    in this connection it is worth noting the text - book example of babio@xmath25 system where we unexpectedly deal with the disproportionated ba@xmath13 + ba@xmath26 ground state instead of the conventional lattice of ba@xmath23 cations.@xcite the bismuthate situation can be viewed also as a result of a condensation of ct excitons , in other words , the spontaneous generation of self - trapped ct excitons in the ground state with a proper transformation of lattice parameters . at present , a ct instability with regard to disproportionation",
    "is believed to be a rather typical property for a number of perovskite 3d transition - metal oxides such as srfeo@xmath25 , lacuo@xmath25 , rnio@xmath25 @xcite , moreover , in solid state chemistry one consider tens of disproportionated systems.@xcite new principles must be developed to treat such charge or ct unstable systems with their dramatical non - fermi - liquid behavior .",
    "in particular , we have to change the current paradigm of the metal - to - insulator ( mi ) transition to that of an insulator - to - metal ( i m ) phase transition .",
    "these two approaches imply essentially different starting points : the former starts from a rather simple _ metallic - like _ scenario with inclusion of correlation effects , while the latter does from strongly correlated _ atomic - like _ scenario with the inclusion of a charge transfer .",
    "electron - lattice polarization effects accompanying the charge transfer appear to be of primary importance to stabilize either phase state .",
    "one should emphasize that the theoretical description of such systems is one of the challenging problems in solid state physics .",
    "hereafter , we develop a model approach to describe different charge fluctuations and charge phases in strongly correlated 3d oxides with main focus on the correlated ct effects . as an illustrative model system",
    "we address a simple mixed - valence system with three possible stable nondegenerate valent states of a cation - anionic cluster , hereafter @xmath27 : @xmath28 , forming the charge ( isospin ) triplet .",
    "the @xmath2 valent state is associated with the _ conceptually simple _ one like cuo@xmath29 in insulating copper oxides ( cuo , la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 , yba@xmath14cu@xmath25o@xmath30 , sr@xmath14cuo@xmath14cl@xmath14 , ... ) or mno@xmath31 in manganite lamno@xmath25 or bio@xmath31 in bismuthates .",
    "it is worth noting that such a model is a most relevant to describe different cuprates where novel concepts should compete with a traditional hubbard model approach in a hole representation implying the vacuum state formed by @xmath32 ( cuo@xmath33 ) centers , and some concentration of holes .",
    "that is why overall the paper we refer the insulating cuprates to illustrate the main concepts of the approach developed . our mathematics is based on the @xmath1 pseudo - spin formalism ( see e.g. review article ref . ) to be the effective tool for the description of the essential physics both of insulators unstable with regard to the ct fluctuations and related mixed - valence systems .",
    "such an approach provides the universal framework for a unified description of these systems as possible phase states of a certain _ parent multi - stable system_. in addition , we may make use of powerful methods developed in the physics of spin systems .",
    "the model system of @xmath0 centers is described in frames of @xmath1 pseudo - spin formalism by an effective anisotropic non - heisenberg hamiltonian which includes two types of correlated two - center hopping : @xmath34 respectively .",
    "it should be noted that we neglect all the intra - center transition , including anion - cation o 2p-3d charge transfer .",
    "our main goal is to describe different charge phases of the model system and a scenario of evolution of visibly typical insulator to unconventional electron - hole bose liquid which reveals many unexpected properties , including superconductivity .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we address a metal - oxide cluster model , different mechanisms of correlation effects , and the effects of electron - lattice polarization . in sec.iii we introduce the @xmath1 pseudo - spin formalism to describe the model mixed - valence systems .",
    "the effective pseudo - spin hamiltonian and possible mean - field phase states of the mixed - valence systems are discussed in sec.iv .",
    "in sec.v we analyse an eh - representation of different excitations in a monovalent @xmath2 phase , discuss a ct instability , and nucleation of electroh - hole ( eh ) droplets .",
    "electron - hole bose liquid is discussed in sec.vi .",
    "some topological skyrmion - like charge fluctuations in the model mixed valence system are described in sec.vii .",
    "implications for cuprates and manganites are discussed in sec.viii .",
    "the electronic states in strongly correlated 3d oxides manifest both significant correlations and dispersional features . the dilemma posed by such",
    "a combination is the overwhelming number of configurations which must be considered in treating strong correlations in a truly bulk system .",
    "one strategy to deal with this dilemma is to restrict oneself to small 3d - metal - oxygen clusters , creating model hamiltonians whose spectra may reasonably well represent the energy and dispersion of the important excitations of the full problem .",
    "indeed , such clusters as cuo@xmath15 in quasi-2d cuprates , mno@xmath30 in manganite perovskites are basic elements of crystalline and electronic structure . despite a number of principal shortcomings , including the boundary conditions , the breaking of local symmetry of boundary atoms , sharing of common anions for @xmath35 clusters etc .",
    ", the embedded molecular cluster method provides both , a clear physical picture of the complex electronic structure and the energy spectrum , as well as the possibility of quantitative modelling .",
    "@xcite , as well as ghijsen _",
    "@xcite have shown that in a certain sense the cluster calculations might provide a better description of the overall electronic structure of insulating 3d oxides than band - structure calculations .",
    "in particular , they allow to take better into account different correlation effects .    below , in the section we discuss some aspects of electronic structure , energy spectrum , and correlation effects for an illustrative example of cuo@xmath15 clusters embedded into an insulating cuprate .",
    "beginning from 5 cu @xmath36 and 12 o @xmath37 atomic orbitals for cuo@xmath15 cluster with @xmath38 symmetry , it is easy to form 17 symmetrized @xmath39 ( gerade = even ) and @xmath40 ( ungerade = odd ) orbitals .",
    "the even cu @xmath36 @xmath41 orbitals hybridize , due to strong cu @xmath36-o @xmath37 covalency , with even o @xmath37-orbitals of the same symmetry , thus forming appropriate bonding @xmath42 and antibonding @xmath43 states . among the odd orbitals",
    "only @xmath44 and @xmath45 hybridize due to nearest neighbor @xmath46 overlap and transfer thus forming appropriate bonding @xmath47 and antibonding @xmath48 purely oxygen states .",
    "the purely oxygen @xmath49 orbitals are nonbonding .",
    "all `` planar '' o @xmath37 orbitals in accordance with the orientation of lobes could be classified as @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) or @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) orbitals , respectively .",
    "bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals in hole representation can be presented , for example , as follows @xmath54 @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 is a superposition of four o 2p orbitals with @xmath58 symmetry .",
    "plaquette with parameters relevant for a number of insulating cuprates.,width=321 ]    fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] presents a single - hole energy spectrum for a cuo@xmath15 plaquette embedded into an insulating cuprate like sr@xmath14cuo@xmath14cl@xmath14 calculated with a reasonable set of parameters.@xcite for illustration we show also a step - by - step formation of the cluster energy levels from the bare cu @xmath36 and o @xmath37 levels with the successive inclusion of crystalline field ( cf ) effects , o @xmath37-o @xmath37 , and cu @xmath36-o @xmath37 covalency .",
    "it is worth noting that strong cu 3d - o 2p overlap and covalency result in a dramatic difference between cuo@xmath59 center and cu@xmath12 cation as its naive analogue .",
    "starting from cuo@xmath29 center as a realization of @xmath2 center we arrive at cuo@xmath33 and cuo@xmath60 centers as realizations of hole @xmath61 and electron @xmath32 centers , respectively .",
    "the electron cuo@xmath60 center has a filled set of cu 3d and o 2p orbitals , and is often addressed to be a generalization of cu@xmath62 ion .",
    "the hole cuo@xmath33 center has actually two - hole configuration with the lowest zhang - rice ( zr ) spin - singlet @xmath63 state @xcite formed by the interaction of three `` covalent '' configurations : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 , respectively , or three `` purely ionic '' two - hole configurations @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 . here , @xmath70 and @xmath71 are the non - hybridized cu 3@xmath72 and o 2@xmath73 orbitals , respectively , with bare energies @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "let us present a simple example of the calculation of the two - hole spectrum in the zr - singlet sector .",
    "the matrix of the full effective hamiltonian within the bare purely ionic basis set has a rather simple form @xmath76 where the effective coulomb parameter for purely oxygen configuration incorporates both the intra - atomic parameter @xmath77 and the oxygen - oxygen coupling to the first and second nearest neighbors , respectively @xmath78 and the following condition holds : @xmath79 for reasonable values of parameters ( in ev ) : @xmath80 , @xmath81 , @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 , @xmath85 ( see ref .   )",
    "we obtain for the zr - singlet energy @xmath86 , and its wave function @xmath87 where @xmath88 .",
    "it reflects the well - known result that the zr - singlet represents a two - hole configuration with one predominantly cu @xmath36 and one predominantly o @xmath37 hole .",
    "it is worth noting that the hole @xmath89 center sometimes one naively associate with @xmath90 ion , however , such a conclusion is a rather far from reality .",
    "indeed , this center is the mixed valence one , as the @xmath91 valence resonates between @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "the two excited states with energies @xmath94 and @xmath95 ev are described by the wave functions @xmath96 @xmath97 respectively . given the zr - singlet energy one may calculate the minimal energy for @xmath98 charge transfer : @xmath99 where the stabilization energy for the bonding @xmath100 state is simply calculated from matrix ( [ u ] ) at @xmath101 . it should be emphasized that this quantity plays a particular role as the minimal charge transfer energy which specifies the charge transfer gap . in the general case",
    "it is defined as follows : @xmath102 or as the energy required to remove a hole from one region of the crystal and add it to another region beyond the range of excitonic correlations .",
    "the exact diagonalization studies for a series of clusters with different size @xcite show that @xmath103 strongly diminishes with cluster size from @xmath104ev for small clusters to @xmath105ev as extrapolated value for large clusters .",
    "our simple calculation points to a significant role of correlation effect .",
    "indeed , the inter - configurational coupling due to coulomb repulsion results in a visible deviation of the two - hole ground state wave function from the predictions of simple model of noninteracting particles @xmath106 @xmath107 in particular , it could give rise to a strong renormalization of the hole transfer integrals .",
    "the correlation problem becomes of primary importance for atoms / ions near coulomb instability when the one - electron gluing can not get over the destructive effect of the electron - electron repulsion .",
    "such a situation seems to realize in oxides where hirsch _",
    "et al_. @xcite have proposed an instability of o@xmath108(2p@xmath11 ) electronic background .",
    "the main suggestion in their theory of `` anionic metal '' concerns the occurrence of the non - rigid degenerate structure for a closed electron shell such as o@xmath108(2p@xmath11 ) with the internal purely correlation degrees of freedom .",
    "in other words , one should expect sizeable correlation effects not only from unfilled 3d- or oxygen 2p shells , but from completely filled o 2p@xmath11 shell ! in order to relevantly describe such a non - rigid atomic background and its coupling to the valent hole one might use a concept of the well - known `` shell - droplet '' model for nuclei after bohr and mottelson.@xcite in accordance with the model a set of completely filled electron shells which form an atomic background or vacuum state for a hole representation is described by certain internal collective degrees of freedom and a number of physical quantities such as electric quadrupole and magnetic moments .",
    "valent hole(s ) moves around this non - rigid background with strong interaction inbetween .",
    "such an approach strongly differs from the textbook one that implies a rigid atomic orbital basis irrespective of varying filling number and external potential .",
    "none of the effective many - body hamiltonians that are most widely used to study the effect of electron correlation in solids such as the hubbard model , the anderson impurity and lattice models , the kondo model , contain this very basic and fundamental aspect of electron correlation that follows from the atomic analysis .",
    "@xcite the hubbard on - site repulsion u between opposite spin electrons on the same atomic orbital is widely regarded to be the only important source of electron correlation in solids .",
    "it is a clear oversimplification , and we need in a more realistic atomic models to describe these effects , especially for atoms in a specific external potential giving rise to a coulomb instability . to this end",
    "we have proposed a generalized non - rigid shell model ( see refs . ) .",
    "the model represents a variational method for the many - electron atomic configurations with the trial parameters being the coordinates of the center of the one - particle atomic orbital .",
    "the resulting displacement of the atomic orbitals allows a simple interpretation of the electron density redistribution stemmed from taking into account the electron - electron repulsion , and the symmetry of a system can be readily used for the construction of the trial many - electron wave function . as a whole , the model bears a strong resemblance to the conventional well - known shell model by dick and overhauser @xcite widely used in lattice dynamics . in frames of the model the ionic configuration with filled electron shells is considered to be constituted of an outer spherical shell of 2(2l+1 ) electrons and a core consisting of the nucleus and the remaining electrons . in an electric field",
    "the rigid shell retains its spherical charge distribution but moves bodily with respect to the core .",
    "the polarizability is made finite by a harmonic restoring force of spring constant @xmath109 which acts between the core and shell .",
    "the shells of two ions repel one another and tend to become displaced with respect to the ion cores because of this repulsion .",
    "the respective displacement vector appears to be a simplest @xmath110 coordinate which specifies the change of the electron - nucleus attraction .",
    "it should be noted that such a displacement does not imply any variation in electron - electron repulsion and respective correlation energy .",
    "however , as we shall see below , a simple shell model can be easily generalized to take account of correlation effects .",
    "to this end we must consider the displacements of separate one - electron orbitals to form the set of the variational parameters in a correlation function .",
    "then we can introduce both the displacement of the center of `` gravity '' for filled shell and a set of the relative displacements of separate one - electron orbitals with regard to each other .",
    "the former form an `` acoustical '' mode and are described in frames of conventional shell model , while the latter form different novel `` optical '' modes .",
    "such a seemingly naive non - rigid shell picture can provide both the microscopic substantiation of the conventional shell model and its generalization .",
    "moreover , this _ non - rigid shell model _ points to a physically clear procedure to account for the correlation effects .",
    "indeed , the `` optical '' displacement mode is believed to provide the minimal electron - electron repulsion .",
    "the non - rigid shell represents a novel specific atomic state that can be remarkably realized near a coulomb instability .",
    "the idea of displaced atomic shells has appeared many years ago @xcite in the very beginning of the quantum chemical era , and reflected the naive picture of the repelling electrons .",
    "however , the physically sound idea did not receive the relevant position in the hierarchy of correlation effects .",
    "as it is mentioned above , the minimal energy cost of the optically excited disproportionation or electron - hole formation in insulating cuprates is @xmath111 ev .",
    "however , the question arises , what is the energy cost for the thermal excitation of such a local disproportionation ?",
    "the answer implies first of all the knowledge of relaxation energy , or the energy gain due to the lattice polarization by the localized charges .",
    "the full polarization energy @xmath112 includes the cumulative effect of @xmath113 and @xmath114 terms , associated with the displacement of electron shells and ionic cores , respectively.@xcite the former term @xmath115 is due to the _ non - retarded _ effect of the electronic polarization by the momentarily localized electron - hole pair given the ionic cores fixed at their perfect crystal positions .",
    "such a situation is typical for lattice response accompanying the franck - condon transitions ( optical excitation , photoionization ) . on the other hand , all the long - lived excitations ,",
    "i.e. , all the intrinsic thermally activated states and the extrinsic particles produced as a result of doping , injection or optical pumping should be regarded as stationary states of a system with a deformed lattice structure .",
    "these relaxed states should be determined from the condition that the system energy has a local minimum when account is taken of the interaction of the electrons and holes with the lattice deformations .",
    "at least , it means that we can not , strictly speaking , make use of the same energy parameters to describe the optical ( e.g. photoexcited ) hole and thermal ( e.g. doped ) hole .",
    "for the illustration of polarization effects in cuprates we apply the shell model calculations to look specifically at energies associated with the localized holes of cu@xmath13 and o@xmath20 in `` parent '' la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 compound .",
    "it follows from these calculations that there is a large difference in the lattice relaxation energies for o@xmath20 and cu@xmath13 holes .",
    "the lattice relaxation energy , -@xmath116 , caused by the hole localization at the o - site ( 4.44 ev ) appears to be significantly larger than that for the hole localized at the cu - site ( 2.20 ev ) .",
    "this indicates the strong electron - lattice interaction in the case of the hole localized at the o - site and could suggest that the hole trapping is more preferential in the oxygen sublattice . in both cases we deal with the several ev - effect both for @xmath113 and @xmath114 contributions to relaxation energy .",
    "moreover , such an estimation seems to be typical for different insulators.@xcite it is worth noting that the electron - lattice interaction is believed to be one of the main sources of correlated particle hopping resulting in different probabilities for two types of a charge transfer .",
    "transition metal oxides with strong electron and lattice polarization effects need in a revisit of many conventional theoretical concepts and approaches .",
    "in particular , we should modify conventional hubbard model as it is done , for instance , in a `` dynamic '' hubbard model by hirsch @xcite or a modified peierls - hubbard model @xcite with a classical description of the anharmonic core / shell displacements .",
    "having in mind the application to insulating cuprates let address a square lattice hubbard model with a half - filling and a strong on - site coupling of valent hole with core / shell displacements , which is described by the following hamiltonian @xmath117 @xmath118 where @xmath119 ( @xmath120 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators for valent hole ; @xmath121 is the transfer integral between two neighboring lattice sites which depends on the dimensionless core / shell displacement coordinate ; @xmath122 is the on - site repulsion energy ; @xmath123 is the configurational energy that incorporates the coupling between valent holes and the site - localized anharmonic core / shell mode with dimensionless displacement coordinate @xmath124 ; @xmath125 where @xmath126 are the functions of the hole occupation number such as @xmath127 it is clear that @xmath123 includes the renormalization both of the one - particle energy and the on - site hole - hole repulsion . the last term in ( [ h ] )",
    "represents the intersite configurational coupling .",
    "the @xmath128-dependence of transfer integral implies the correlated character of the hole hopping , and can be transformed into the effective dependence on hole occupation number @xcite @xmath129 with @xmath130 being the correlated hopping parameters .",
    "the conventional hubbard hamiltonian , or @xmath131-@xmath122-model , stabilizes the spin density wave ( sdw ) electron order with @xmath132 . in a strongly correlated limit @xmath133 the hubbard model reduces to a heisenberg antiferromagnetic model .",
    "depending on the parameters of the hole - configurational coupling and correlated hopping the modified hubbard hamiltonian ( [ h ] ) can stabilize the `` disproportionated '' or charge ordered ( co ) electron phase with the on - site filling numbers @xmath134 , and @xmath135 thus leading to the `` negative - u '' effect .",
    "even simple modified model turns out to be very complicated and leads to a very rich physics.@xcite depending on the values of parameters the system yields the sdw phase with no core / shell displacements as a @xmath136 ground state with a global minimum of free energy , and co phase with shell displacements as a @xmath137 ground state with a local minimum , or vice versa.@xcite strong anharmonicity @xmath123 makes possible phase transitions between the phases the first order ones .      in general , charge , spin and vibronic modes",
    "are strongly coupled and so we have to do with the hybrid modes . for a weak intermode coupling regime",
    "the charge transfer is accompanied by the induced local structural fluctuations , that provides the vibronic reduction of the charge transfer integral : @xmath138 where @xmath139 is a vibronic reduction factor , @xmath140 is an overlap integral for the local oscillatory states with and without particle transferred . in an opposite regime of the strong intermode coupling one",
    "assumes that different electronic parameters for the @xmath141- and @xmath142-centers are distinguished significantly up to different type of the adiabatic potential and appropriate jt mode .",
    "this regime favors the charge localization .",
    "the vibronic reduction factor @xmath139 , or the franck - condon factor @xcite may be written as follows @xmath143 where @xmath144 and @xmath145 in a complicated manner depend on the vibronic constants , the oxygen and 3d - metal atomic masses . for a simplest one - dimensional single - mode case @xmath146 where @xmath147 and @xmath148 are the effective oscillatory lengths of the @xmath149- and @xmath150-centers , respectively , @xmath151",
    ", @xmath152 is the distance separating the minima of the adiabatic potential for the @xmath149- and @xmath150-centers .",
    "overall the paper we neglect a spin degree of freedom which can crucially impact on the charge transport .",
    "the most part of 3d oxides are characterized by an antiferromagnetic spin background that implies a localization effect due to strong spin reduction of one - particle transfer integrals and the probability amplitude for a polar center transfer @xmath153 or the motion of the electron ( hole ) center in the matrix of @xmath2-centers . from the other hand , in antiferromagnets",
    "there is no problems with another type of the ct which specifies the probability amplitude for a local disproportionation , or the spin - singlet @xmath154-pair creation : @xmath98 , and the inverse process of the spin - singlet @xmath154-pair recombination : @xmath155 . in other words",
    ", the spin subsystem can strongly affect the correlated character of the charge transfer leading to unconventional situations like that of spin - singlet eh - pairs moving through the lattice freely without disturbing the antiferromagnetic spin background , in contrast to the single particle motion .",
    "so , it seems that the situation in antiferromagnetic 3d insulators may differ substantially from that in usual semiconductors or in other bandlike insulators where , as a rule , the effective mass of the electron - hole pair is larger than that of an unbound electron and hole .",
    "the problem of the multi - stability of solids looks rather trivial when one say about the orbital and/or spin degrees of freedom .",
    "usually in such a case we start from the lattice of coupled orbital and/or spin momenta described by the relevant ( spin-)hamiltonian that implies the variety of possible collective orbital and/or spin orderings that compete with each other under different external conditions . in other words ,",
    "the multi - stability accompanies the basic degeneracy inherent to a certain atom , ion , or center with a nonzero orbital and/or spin momentum .",
    "such an outlook is believed to be easily extended to systems with charge degree of freedom which can be represented to be a system of either centers which possible charge states form a pseudo - multiplet .",
    "below we address a simple model of a mixed - valence system with three possible stable valent states of a cation - anionic cluster , hereafter @xmath27 : @xmath28 , forming the charge ( isospin ) triplet .",

    "below we intend to concentrate themselves on charge degree of freedom , and that is why we neglect the orbital , spin , and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "it implies a renormalization of different parameters , mainly it concerns the charge transfer .",
    "similarly to the neutral - to - ionic electronic - structural transformation in organic charge - transfer crystals ( see paper by t. luty in ref . ) the system of charge triplets can be described in frames of the s=1 pseudo - spin formalism . to this end",

    "thus , the charge gap , often used to define the binding energy of excitons , is not a decisive criterion by which to decide whether a state is bound or unbound .    in practice , many authors consider excitons to consist of real - space configurations with electrons and holes occupying the nearest neighbor sites , while the electrons and holes are separated from each other in the conduction - band states @xcite .",

    "the problem of a doped insulator is sure much more complicated than it is implied in oversimplified approaches such as an effective @xmath131-@xmath471-model when the situation resembles that of `` throwing the baby out of the bathwater '' .    in a case of cuprates",
    "we deal with systems which conventional ground state seems to be unstable with regard to the transformation into a new phase state with a variety of unusual properties .    in our view , the essential physics of the doped cuprates , as well as other strongly correlated oxides , is driven by a self - trapping of the ct excitons , both one - center , and two - center .",
    "@xcite such excitons are the result of self - consistent charge transfer and lattice distortion with the appearance of the `` negative-@xmath122 '' effect.@xcite the two - center excitons are associated with ct transitions between two cuo@xmath15 plaquettes , and may be considered as quanta of the disproportionation reaction @xmath472 with the creation of electron cuo@xmath60 and hole cuo@xmath33 centers .",
    "thus , three types of cuo@xmath15 centers cuo@xmath473 should be considered on equal footing . in this connection",
    "we would like to draw special attention to the lattice polarization and relaxation effects that are of primary importance both for the formation of ct exciton itself and its self - trapping .",
    "it should be noted that the photo - excited electron - hole pairs or excitons are stabilized into self - trapped excitons ( ste ) accompanied with lattice relaxation within several pico - seconds.@xcite    in contrast with babio@xmath25 system where we deal with a spontaneous generation of self - trapped ct excitons in the ground state , the parent insulating cuprates are believed to be near excitonic instability when the self - trapped ct excitons form the candidate relaxed excited states to struggle with the conventional ground state .",
    "@xcite in other words , the lattice relaxed ct excited state should be treated on an equal footing with the ground state .",
    "if the interaction between ste were attractive and so large that the cohesive energy @xmath474 per one ste exceeds the energy @xmath475 of one ste , the ste s and/or its clusters will be spontaneously generated everywhere without any optical excitation , and be condensed to form a new electronic state on a new lattice structure .",
    "@xcite    the minimal energy cost of the optically excited disproportionation or electron - hole formation in insulating cuprates is @xmath476 ev .",
    "@xcite interestingly , that this relatively small value of the optical gap was nevertheless used by goodenough @xcite as argument against the `` negative - u '' disproportionation reaction 2cu(ii ) = cu(iii ) + cu(i ) , or more correctly 2[cuo@xmath29]=[cuo@xmath33]+[cuo@xmath60 ] in cuprates .",
    "however , the question arises , what is the energy cost for the thermal excitation of such a disproportionation ?",
    "in other words , what is the energy of self - trapped two - center ct exciton ?",
    "it is this quantity rather than its optical counterpart defines the activation energy for such a reaction .",
    "the question is of primary importance for the self - trapping scenario .",
    "the answer implies first of all the knowledge of electronic and ionic polarization energies for electron and hole .",
    "the polarization effects with its typical energy scale of the order of several ev appear to be of primary importance when one considers different charge fluctuations in insulators .",
    "several general theories of self - trapping have been proposed starting from works by landau , pekar and toyozawa , however , the stages of the st process and detailed atomistic and electronic structure of st - excitons and st - holes are still unclear even in rather simple and well - studied systems such as alkali - metal halides .",
    "as regards the ste in cuprates , we have some straightforward experimental indications .",
    "a key characteristic of the ste is its luminescence : ste are short - lived luminescent states of excited crystals .",
    "the observation of photoluminescence ( pl ) near @xmath480 ev in la@xmath14cuo@xmath15 , @xcite near @xmath481 and @xmath327 ev in yba@xmath14cu@xmath25o@xmath482 , @xcite near @xmath483 ev in prba@xmath14cu@xmath25o@xmath482 @xcite is a direct evidence of strongly localized long - lived states related to self - trapped excitons or their derivatives .",
    "the near - infrared photoluminescence was observed in many insulating cuprates .",
    "@xcite to the best of our knowledge the most detailed pl study was performed by denisov _",
    "et al_. @xcite in yba@xmath14cu@xmath25o@xmath375 in the spectral range @xmath484 ev .",
    "the low - temperature pl in yba@xmath14cu@xmath25o@xmath30 consists of three peaks at @xmath485 , @xmath486 , and @xmath487 ev , respectively .",
    "the pl intensity is much stronger at small doping level .",
    "moreover , the doping induced pl suppression manifests itself more strongly for the low - energy than for the high - energy pl peaks . at @xmath488 only the high - energy peak located at @xmath489 ev ( @xmath490 ) survives that allows us to assume that the ste decay becomes more effective with doping . the high - energy pl peak red - shifts with the lowering the temperature , and its intensity decreases .",
    "all these features can be consistently explained in frames of the ste nature of pl .",
    "different pl peak can be assigned both to different ste and its clusters pointing to the multistage character of the luminescence .",
    "cuprates are believed to be unconventional systems which are unstable with regard to a self - trapping of the low - energy charge transfer excitons with a nucleation of electron - hole ( eh ) droplets being actually the system of coupled electron cuo@xmath60 and hole cuo@xmath33 centers having been glued in lattice due to a strong electron - lattice polarization effects . phase transition to novel hypothetically metallic state could be realized due to a mechanism familiar to semiconductors with filled bands such as ge and si where given certain conditions one observes a formation of metallic eh - liquid as a result of the exciton decay .",
    "@xcite the system of strongly correlated electron cuo@xmath60 and hole cuo@xmath33 centers appears to be equivalent to an electron - hole bose - liquid ( ehbl ) in contrast with the electron - hole fermi - liquid in conventional semiconductors . a simple model description of such a liquid implies a system of local singlet bosons with a charge of @xmath491 moving in a lattice formed by hole centers .",
    "local boson in our scenario represents the electron counterpart of zhang - rice singlet , or two - electron configuration @xmath492 .",
    "naturally , that conventional electron cuo@xmath60 center represents a relaxed state of composite system : `` hole cuo@xmath33 center plus local singlet boson '' , while the `` non - retarded '' scenario of a novel phase is assumed to incorporate the unconventional states of electron cuo@xmath60 center up to its orbital degeneracy .",
    "thus we can introduce the concept of insulator - to - ehbl transition as the spontaneous condensation of self - trapped excitons and its clusters .",
    "however , in cuprates we deal with the electron / hole injection to the insulating parent phase due to a nonisovalent substitution as in la@xmath16sr@xmath17cuo@xmath18 , nd@xmath16ce@xmath17cuo@xmath18 , or change in oxygen stoihiometry as in yba@xmath14cu@xmath25o@xmath375 , la@xmath376cuo@xmath377 , la@xmath376cu@xmath378li@xmath17o@xmath18 .",
    "such a substitution provokes the nucleation of eh droplets and shifts the phase equilibrium from the insulating state to the unconventional electron - hole bose liquid , or , in other words , induces the insulator - to - ehbl phase transition .",
    "hence , the formation of ehbl in cuprates can be considered as the first order phase transition .",
    "the doping in cuprates gradually shifts the ehbl state away from half - filing .",
    "it is clear that the ehbl scenario makes the doped cuprates the objects of @xmath493 physics .",
    "there are numerous experimental evidence that support the bosonic scenario for doped cuprates.@xcite in this connection , we would like to draw attention to the little known results of comparative high - temperature studies of thermoelectric power and conductivity which unambiguously reveal the charge carriers with @xmath491 , or two - electron(hole ) transport.@xcite the well - known relation @xmath494 with @xmath495 is fulfilled with high accuracy in the limit of high temperatures ( @xmath496 ) for different cuprates ( yba@xmath376cu@xmath497o@xmath375 , la@xmath497ba@xmath497cu@xmath482o@xmath498 , ( nd@xmath499ce@xmath500)@xmath18(ba@xmath499nd@xmath500)@xmath18cu@xmath482o@xmath501 ) .",
    "parent manganites such as lamno@xmath25 are antiferromagnetic insulators with the charge transfer gap .",
    "fundamental absorption band in parent manganites is formed both by the intracenter o2p - mn3d transfer @xcite and by the small intercenter charge transfer excitons,@xcite which in terms of chemical notions represent somewhat like the disproportionation quanta with a rather low threshold of the order of 3 ev , resulting in a formation of electron mno@xmath502 and hole mno@xmath503 centers .",
    "the ct excitons in lamno@xmath25 prone to a self - trapping @xcite and may be considered to be well defined entities only at small content , whereas at large densities their coupling is screened and their overlap becomes so considerable that they loose individuality , become unstable with regard to the decay ( the dissociation ) to electron and hole centers , and we come to a system of electrons and holes , which form an eh bose liquid .",
    "an instability of parent manganite lamno@xmath25 with regard to the overall disproportionation such as @xmath504 was strikingly demonstrated recently by zhou and goodenough .",
    "@xcite the transport ( thermoelectric power and resistivity ) and magnetic ( susceptibility ) measurements showed that lamno@xmath25 above the cooperative jahn - teller orbital - ordering temperature @xmath505 k transforms into charge - disproportionated paramagnetic phase with @xmath506 and cooperative charge transfer of many heavy vibronic charge carriers .",
    "it seems rather obvious that with the lowering the temperature we arrive at a system with the well developed fluctuations of the eh bose - liquid phase .",
    "strong variation of the lamno@xmath25 raman spectra with increasing laser power @xcite could be related to the photo - induced nucleation and the volume expansion of the eh bose - liquid , especially , as at a rather big excitation wavelength @xmath507 nm , at @xmath508 nm the absorption is considerably stronger in the domains of novel phase than in parent lattice .",
    "effective nucleation of the eh bose - liquid in manganites could be provoked by a non - isovalent substitution since this strongly polarizable or even metallic phase in contrast with parent insulating phase provides an effective screening of charge inhomogeneity .",
    "indeed , in thermoelectric power ( tep ) experiments with doped manganites such as la@xmath378sr@xmath17mno@xmath25 hundley and neumeier @xcite have found that more hole - like charge carriers or alternatively fewer accessible mn sites are present than expected for the value @xmath509 .",
    "they suggest a charge disproportionation model based on the instability of mn@xmath13-mn@xmath13 relative to that of mn@xmath23-mn@xmath12 .",
    "this transformation provides excellent agreement with doping - dependent trends exhibited by both tep and resistivity .    a simplified `` chemical '' approach to an eh bose - liquid as to a disproportionated phase @xcite naively implies an occurrence of mn@xmath23 and mn@xmath12 ions .",
    "however , such an approach is very far from reality .",
    "indeed , the electron mno@xmath502 and hole mno@xmath503 centers are already the mixed valence centers,@xcite as in the former the @xmath510 valence resonates between @xmath92 and @xmath262 , and in the latter does between @xmath511 and @xmath93 .    in this connection",
    ", one should note that in a sense disproportionation reaction ( [ dispro ] ) has several purely ionic counterparts , the two rather simple    mn@xmath13-o@xmath108-mn@xmath512 mn@xmath12-o@xmath108-mn@xmath23 ,    and    mn@xmath13-o@xmath108-mn@xmath512 mn@xmath12-o@xmath513-mn@xmath13 ,    and , finally , one rather complicated    o@xmath108-mn@xmath13-o@xmath514 o@xmath513-mn@xmath62-o@xmath513 .",
    "thus , the disproportionation ( [ dispro ] ) threshold energy has to be maximally close to the ct energy parameter @xmath515 .",
    "moreover , namely this is seemingly to be one of the main parameters governing the nucleation of eh bose - liquid in oxides .",
    "so far , there has been no systematic exploration of exact valence and spin state of mn in these systems .",
    "et al_. @xcite attempted to support the mn@xmath13/mn@xmath23 model , based on the mn 2p x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xpes ) and o1s absorption .",
    "however , the significant discrepancy between the weighted mn@xmath13/mn@xmath23 spectrum and the experimental one for given @xmath509 suggests a more complex doping effect .",
    "subias et al.@xcite examined the valence state of mn utilizing mn @xmath350-edge x - ray absorption near edge spectra ( xanes ) , however , a large discrepancy is found between experimental spectra given intermediate doping and appropriate superposition of the end members .",
    "the valence state of mn in ca - doped lamno@xmath25 was studied by high - resolution mn @xmath516 emission spectroscopy by tyson _",
    "no evidence for mn@xmath12 was observed at any @xmath509 values seemingly ruling out proposals regarding the mn@xmath13 disproportionation .",
    "however , this conclusion seems to be absolutely unreasonable .",
    "indeed , electron center mno@xmath517 can be found in two configuration with formal mn valence mn@xmath12 and mn@xmath62 ( not simply mn@xmath12 ! ) , respectively . in its turn",
    ", the hole center mno@xmath518 can be found in two configurations with formal mn valence mn@xmath23 and mn@xmath13 ( not simply mn@xmath23 ! ) , respectively .",
    "so , within the model the mn @xmath516 emission spectrum for ca - doped lamn@xmath519 has to be a superposition of appropriately weighted mn@xmath62 , mn@xmath12 , mn@xmath13 , mn@xmath23 contributions ( not simply mn@xmath23 and mn@xmath13 , as one assumes in ref . ) .",
    "unfortunately , we do not know the mn @xmath516 emission spectra for the oxide compounds with mn@xmath62 ions , however a close inspection of the mn @xmath516 emission spectra for the series of mn - oxide compounds with mn valence varying from @xmath520 to @xmath521 ( fig.2 of the cited paper ) allows to uncover a rather clear dependence on valence , and indicates a possibility to explain the experimental spectrum for ca - doped lamno@xmath25 as a superposition of appropriately weighted mn@xmath62 , mn@xmath12 , mn@xmath13 , mn@xmath23 contributions .",
    "it should be noted that an `` arrested '' mn - valence response to the doping in the @xmath522 range founded in ref .",
    "is also consistent with the creation of predominantly oxygen holes .",
    "this set of conflicting data together with a number of additional data @xcite suggests the need for an in - depth exploration of the mn valence problem in this perovskite system .",
    "however , one might say , the doped manganites are not only systems with mixed valence , but systems with @xmath259 valence , where we can not , strictly speaking , unambiguously distinguish mn species with either distinct valence state .",
    "we have developed a model approach to describe charge fluctuations and different charge phases in strongly correlated 3d oxides . in frames of @xmath1 pseudo - spin formalism different phase states of the system of the metal - oxide @xmath27 centers with three different valent state @xmath0 are considered on the equal footing .",
    "simple uniform mean - field phases include an insulating monovalent @xmath2-phase , mixed - valence binary ( disproportionated ) @xmath3-phase , and mixed - valence ternary ( `` under - disproportionated '' ) @xmath0-phase .",
    "we consider two first phases in more details focusing on the problem of electron / hole states and different types of excitons in @xmath2-phase and formation of electron - hole bose liquid in @xmath3-phase .",
    "our consideration was focused mainly on a number of issues seemingly being of primary importance for the various strongly correlated oxides such as cuprates , manganites , bismuthates , and other systems with ct instability and/or mixed valence .",
    "these includes two types of single particle correlated hopping and the two - particle hopping , ct excitons , electron - lattice polarization effects which are shown to be crucial for the stabilization of either phase , topological charge fluctuations , nucleation of droplets of the electron - hole bose liquid and phase separation effect .",
    "we emphasize an important role of self - trapped ct excitons in typical mott - hubbard insulators as candidate `` relaxed excited states '' to struggle for stability with ground state and natural nucleation centers for unconventional electron - hole bose liquid which phase state include the superfluid .",
    "pseudo - spin formalism has appeared to be very efficient to reveal and describe different aspects of essential physics for mixed - valence system .",
    "we show that the coherent states provide the optimal way both to a correct mean - field approximation and respective continuous models to describe the pseudo - spin system including different topological charge fluctuations , in particular , like domain walls or bubble domains in antiferromagnets .",
    "all the insulating systems such as @xmath2-phase may be subdivided to two classes : stable and unstable ones with regard to the formation of self - trapped ct excitons .",
    "the latter systems appear to be unstable with regard the formation of ct exciton clusters , or droplets of the electron - hole bose liquid .",
    "the model approach suggested is believed to provide a conceptual framework for an in - depth understanding of physics of strongly correlated oxides such as cuprates , manganites , bismuthates , and other systems with charge transfer excitonic instability and/or mixed valence .",
