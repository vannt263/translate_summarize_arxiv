    "[ a ] we describe an algorithm to compute @xmath112 with any given precision , and obtain the numerical value :    [ a_2 ] @xmath124 .",
    "in section  [ last ] we study an analytic representation of our function @xmath109 and describe an algorithm which permits to compute it .",

    "a problem of control theory dealing with functions in @xmath164 having one simple zero and two simple @xmath4-points is the so - called belgian chocolate problem .",
    "we will give some applications of our results and methods to this problem in section  [ bcp ] .",
    "for the background of this section we refer to  @xcite , but note that what we call _ covering _ is called _ complete covering _ there .",

    "it is easy to see that @xmath176 the hyperbolic metric is defined in the upper half - plane by its length element @xmath177 it descends from @xmath171 to @xmath172 , and there is a shortest hyperbolic geodesic in the class of the generator of the fundamental group .",
    "the hyperbolic length of this shortest geodesic is @xmath178 thus for every non - degenerate ring , there exists a shortest closed geodesic .",
    "it is easy to see that no shortest geodesic exists for a degenerate ring @xmath179 , while in the other degenerate ring , @xmath180 there is no hyperbolic metric , so the notion of shortest geodesic is not defined .",

    "the covering @xmath184 and the group @xmath87 are explicitly constructed as follows : begin with the region @xmath185 let @xmath184 be the conformal map of the right half of @xmath186 onto @xmath171 with the boundary correspondence @xmath187 we note that usually a different boundary correspondence is used , but the one chosen above turns out to be convenient for our purposes .",
    "the map @xmath184 extends to @xmath171 by reflections and gives the universal covering @xmath188 . the fractional linear transformations @xmath189 perform the pairing of the sides of the quadrilateral @xmath186 .",

    "it is freely generated by the two matrices which we denote by the same letters as the two loops described above : @xmath194 thus to each element @xmath36 of @xmath182 corresponds a fractional - linear transformation represented by a pair of matrices @xmath195 .",
