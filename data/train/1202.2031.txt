    "in this paper , we study the cauchy problem for a scalar semilinear degenerate parabolic partial differential equation with stochastic forcing @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a cylindrical wiener process . equations of this type are widely used in fluid mechanics since they model the phenomenon of convection - diffusion of ideal fluid in porous media .",
    "namely , the important applications including for instance two or three - phase flows can be found in petroleum engineering or in hydrogeology . for a thorough exposition of this area given from a practical point of view",
    "we refer the reader to @xcite and to the references cited therein .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to establish the well - posedness theory for solutions of the cauchy problem in any space dimension . towards this end , we adapt the notion of kinetic formulation and kinetic solution which has already been studied in the case of hyperbolic scalar conservation laws in both deterministic ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , or @xcite for a general presentation ) and stochastic setting ( see @xcite ) ; and also in the case of deterministic degenerate parabolic equations of second - order ( see @xcite ) . to the best of our knowledge , in the degenerate case , stochastic equations of type have not been studied yet , neither by means of kinetic formulation nor by any other approach .",
    "the concept of kinetic solution was first introduced by lions , perthame , tadmor in @xcite for deterministic first - order scalar conservation laws and applies to more general situations than the one of entropy solution as considered for example in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "moreover , it appears to be better suited particularly for degenerate parabolic problems since it allows us to keep the precise structure of the parabolic dissipative measure , whereas in the case of entropy solution part of this information is lost and has to be recovered at some stage .",
    "this technique also supplies a good technical framework to prove the @xmath2-comparison principle which allows to prove uniqueness .",
    "nevertheless , kinetic formulation can be derived only for smooth solutions hence the classical result @xcite giving @xmath3-valued solutions for the nondegenerate case has to be improved ( see @xcite ) .    in the case of hyperbolic scalar conservation laws , debussche and",
    "vovelle @xcite defined a notion of generalized kinetic solution and obtained a comparison result showing that any generalized kinetic solution is actually a kinetic solution .",
    "accordingly , the proof of existence simplified since only weak convergence of approximate viscous solutions was necessary .",
    "the situation is quite different in the case of parabolic scalar conservation laws . indeed , due to the parabolic term",
    ", the approach of @xcite is not applicable : the comparison principle can be proved only for kinetic solutions ( not generalized ones ) and therefore strong convergence of approximate solutions is needed in order to prove the existence . moreover ,",
    "the proof of the comparison principle itself is much more delicate then in the hyperbolic case .",
    "the exposition is organised as follows . in section 2",
    "we review the basic setting and define the notion of kinetic solution .",
    "section 3 is devoted to the proof of uniqueness .",
    "we first establish a technical proposition [ propdubling ] which then turns out to be the keystone in the proof of comparison principle in theorem [ uniqueness ] .",
    "we next turn to the proof of existence in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "first of all in section 4 , we make an additional hypotheses upon the initial condition and employ the vanishing viscosity method . in particular , we study certain nondegenerate problems and establish suitable uniform estimates for the corresponding sequence of approximate solutions .",
    "the compactness argument then yields the existence of a martingale kinetic solution which together with the pathwise uniqueness gives the desired kinetic solution ( defined on the original stochastic basis ) . in the final section",
    ", the existence of a kinetic solution is shown for general initial data .",
    "we note that an important step in the proof of existence , identification of the limit of an approximating sequence of solutions , is based on a new general method of constructing martingale solutions of spdes ( see propositions [ ident1 ] , [ ident2 ] and the sequel ) , that does not rely on any kind of martingale representation theorem and therefore holds independent interest especially in situations where these representation theorems are no longer available .",
    "first applications were already done in @xcite , @xcite and , in the finite - dimensional case , also in @xcite .",
    "we now give the precise assumptions on each of the terms appearing in the above equation .",
    "we work on a finite - time interval @xmath4,\\,t>0,$ ] and consider periodic boundary conditions : @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the @xmath7-dimensional torus .",

    "the diffusion matrix @xmath11 is of class @xmath12 , symmetric and positive semidefinite .",
    "its square - root matrix , which is also symmetric and positive semidefinite , is denoted by @xmath13 .",

    "the initial datum may be random in general , namely , we assume @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
