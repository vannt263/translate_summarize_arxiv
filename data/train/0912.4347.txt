    "this classification is based on their @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratios ; stars with a large value of @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio ( @xmath4 100 ) belong to late - type , and those with values of @xmath2c/@xmath3c ratio ( @xmath5 10 ) belong to early - type .",
    "the two groups follow two distinct evolutionary paths .",
    "late - type ch stars are further identified as intrinsic stars that generate s - process elements internally and the early - type ch stars as extrinsic stars ; they receive the s - process elements via binary mass transfer .",
    "the chemical composition of early - type ch stars , if remains unaltered , would bear signatures of the nucleosynthesis processes operating in the low - metallicity agb stars .",
    "abundance analysis of such stars can provide observational constraints for theoretical modelling of @xmath8process nucleosynthesis at very low - metallicity revealing the time of influence of this process on early galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) .",

    "detailed discussions on carbon stars are available in literature including wallerstein and knapp ( 1998 ) and references therein .    in contemporary stellar classification schemes assigning stars to ` morphological",
    "groups ' is largely in practice .",
    "carbon stars are primarily classified based on the strength of carbon molecular bands .",
    "the c - n stars are characterized by strong depression of light in the violet part of the spectrum .",
    "the cause of rapidly weakening continuum below about 4500 is not fully established yet , but believed to be due to scattering by particulate matter .",
    "oxygen - rich stars of similar effective temperatures do not show such weakening .",
    "c - n stars are also easily detected for their characteristic infrared colours .",

    "they are used as tracers of an intermediate age population in extragalactic objects .",
    "ch stars are characterised by the strong g - band of ch in their spectra .",
    "they form a group of warm stars of equivalent spectral types , g and k normal giants , but show weaker metallic lines . in general , ch stars are high velocity objects , large radial velocities indicating that they belong to the halo population of the galaxy ( mcclure 1983 , 1984 , mcclure & woodsworth 1990 ) . `",
    "ch - like ' stars , where ch are less dominant have low space velocities ( yamashita 1975 ) . from radial velocity survey ch stars are known to be binaries . according to the models of mcclure ( 1983 , 1984 ) and mcclure & woodsworth ( 1990 ) the ch binaries have orbital characteristics consistent with the presence of a white dwarf companion .",
    "early type ch stars are believed to have conserved the products of the carbon rich primary received through mass transfer and survived until the present in the galactic halo .",
    "ch stars are not a homogeneous group of stars .",
    "they consist of two populations , the most metal - poor ones have a spherical distribution and the ones slightly richer in metals are characterised by a flattened ellipsoidal distribution ( zinn 1985 ) .",
    "the ratio of the local density of ch stars was found to be @xmath1 30% of metal - poor giants ( hartwick & cowley 1985 ) .",
    "many c - r stars also show a quite strong g band of ch in their spectra . hence ,",
    "based only on the strength of the g - band of ch it is not possible to make a distinction between ch and c - r stars . in such cases",
    "the secondary p - branch head near 4342  serves as a more useful indicator .",
    "this is a well - defined feature in ch stars spectra in contrast to its appearance in c - r stars spectra ( refer fig 2 , 3 of goswami 2005 ) .",
    "another important diagnostic feature is ca i at 4226  which in case of ch stars is weakened by the overlying ch band systems . in c - r star s spectra",
    "this feature is quite strong ; usually the line depth is deeper than the depth of the cn molecular band around 4215  .",
    "these spectral characteristics allow for an identification of the ch and c - r stars even at low resolution .",
    "abundances of neutron - capture elements can also be used as an useful indicator of spectral type .",
    "the abundances of s - process elements are nearly solar in c - r stars ( dominy 1984 ) ; whereas the ch stars show significantly enhanced abundances of the s - process elements relative to iron ( lambert et al . 1986 , green and margon 1994 ) .",
    "although , the c - r as well as ch stars have warmer temperatures than those of c - n stars and blue / violet light is accessible to observation and atmospheric analysis , at low dispersion the narrow lines are difficult to estimate and elemental abundances can not be determined . at low dispersion , therefore , the ` abundance criteria ' can not be used to distinguish the c - r stars from the ch stars .",
    "although the ch and c - r stars have similar range of temperatures , the distribution of ch stars place most of them in the galactic halo .",
    "the large radial velocities , typically @xmath15 200 km s@xmath19 of the ch stars are indicative of their being halo objects ( mcclure 1983 , 1984 ) .",
    "c - j stars spectra are characterized by strong merrill - sanford ( m - s ) bands ascribed to sic@xmath14 that appear in the wavelength region 4900 - 4977  .",
    "the sic@xmath14 being a triatomic molecule , m - s bands are expected to be the strongest in the coolest stars . sic@xmath14 and c@xmath21 have similar molecular structures and in many c stars c@xmath21 molecule is believed to be the cause of ultraviolet depression ( lambert et al .",

    "<S> ch stars form a distinct class of objects with characteristic properties like iron deficiency , enrichment of carbon and overabundance in heavy elements . </S>",
    "<S> these properties can provide strong observational constraints for theoretical computation of nucleosynthesis at low - metallicity . </S>",
    "<S> an important question is the relative surface density of ch stars which can provide valuable inputs to our understanding on the role of low to intermediate - mass stars in the early galactic chemical evolution . </S>",
    "<S> spectroscopic characterization provides an effective way of identifying ch stars . </S>",
    "<S> the present analysis is aimed at a quantitative assessment of the fraction of ch stars in a sample of stars using a set of spectral classification criteria . </S>",
    "<S> the sample consists of ninety two objects selected from a collection of candidate faint high latitude carbon stars from the hamburg / eso survey . </S>",
    "<S> medium resolution ( @xmath0 1300 ) spectra for these objects were obtained using omr at vbo , kavalur and hfosc at hct , iao , hanle , during 2007 - 2009 spanning a wavelength range 3800 - 6800  . </S>",
    "<S> spectral analysis shows 36 of the 92 objects to be potential ch stars ; combined with our earlier studies ( goswami 2005 , goswami et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2007 ) this implies @xmath1 37% ( of 243 ) objects as the ch fraction . </S>",
    "<S> we present spectral descriptions of the newly identified ch star candidates . estimated effective temperatures , @xmath2c/@xmath3c isotopic ratios and their locations on the two colour j - h vs h - k plot </S>",
    "<S> are used to support their identification .    </S>",
