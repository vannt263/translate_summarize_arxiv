    "the presence of magnetic fields in neutron stars and their effect in the thermodynamics of plasmas in the inner regions of neutron stars and in proto - neutron stars has been a subject of study for long time , see  @xcite and references therein . since the pioneering work of woltjer  @xcite who predicted very intense magnetic fields in neutron stars as a result of flux conservation from the projenitor star until the recent experimental measurements of pulsar spin - down rates or x - ray spectral lines from protons inmersed in such intense magnetic fields  @xcite much work has been done . experimental insight into the field",
    "has been obtained from meaurements ranging from radio pulsars where magnetic fields are believed to be in the range @xmath5 g to the so called `` magnetars '' predicted to exist by duncan and thompson in 1992  @xcite and first detected in 1998  @xcite where @xmath6 g. these field strengths strongly decay in a relatively rapid time of @xmath7 years .",
    "two types of astronomical objects seem to be golden candidates for magnetars : soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) and anomalous x - ray pulsars ( axps ) .",
    "experimental observations confirm the idea that both are highly magnetized young neutron stars and can be linked to their original supernova remnants  @xcite .",
    "magnetars are believed to be around @xmath8 of the whole population of neutron stars so they are relatively frequent objects although only a handful of both have been observed  @xcite .",
    "other unconfirmed indications of strong magnetic fields include the possibility of an initial kick - off velocity due to an anisotropic neutrino - pair emission as suggested in  @xcite .    from a theoretical point of view , to study how matter behaves in the presence of such strong magnetic fields some works have dealt with the possibility that nuclear plasmas may be partially magnetized  @xcite .",
    "it is widely known that skyrme models have a characteristic pathology allowing a ferromagnetic transition at high densities even in the absence of magnetic fields  @xcite . however , this transition is not confirmed when simulations are performed using realistic interactions  @xcite . in the outer shells of neutron stars",
    "one should focus in the low density limit of nuclear plasmas where clustered phases may develop  @xcite . for a magnetized system thus , we may have microscopic spin saturated spatial structures similar to magnetic domains .",
    "if present , they may largely enhance the axial response in the neutrino opacities relevant to proto - neutron star early cooling . since neutrino transport seems to be a crucial ingredient in the simulation of supernova core collapse it is important to size the effect of the existence of a strong magnetic field in the microphysics of these plasmas .",
    "the present work performs a comparative study of thermodynamical observables using skyrme and gogny effective nuclear interactions and focus on the possible existence of permanent imanation in the neutron plasma at finite temperature .",
    "the results show that , in the low density region , it is possible to have an increasingly stronger permanent polarization in the plasma at moderate temperatures as magnetic field strengths , higher than @xmath9 g , exist . below this strength",
    "the effects are almost negligible . at intermediate densities",
    "there is a plateau where both forces predict that the polarization remains approximately constant with maximum values around @xmath10 . for higher densities ,",
    "up to the limit where the nucleonic scenario holds , there is a dramatic difference in the behaviour predicted by these two forces .",
    "while skyrme forces allow a ferromagnetic transition gogny forces prevent it .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section  [ model ] , we describe the different nuclear potentials used in the description of the nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction , namely the skyrme and gogny forces . later in this section",
    "we discuss the thermodynamical observables involved in the description of a nuclear plasma in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "results will be presented in section  [ results ] , and summary and conclusions will be given in section  [ summary ] .",
    "we will start by describing the system we want to study .",
    "we consider a pure homogeneous neutron plasma which is composed of particles with spin projection on the z - axis , @xmath11 .",
    "it can be either @xmath12 for spins aligned parallel to a uniform magnetic field that will be taken along the z - direction , @xmath13 , or @xmath14 for antiparallel spins . for a more complete description additional components in the hadronic and leptonic sector",
    "should be considered when beta equilibrium is imposed , however , for simplicity , we have restricted ourselves to the pure one component neutron plasma in this work .    the neutron plasma density , @xmath15 , is composed of up(@xmath16 ) and down(@xmath17 ) spin aligned particles @xmath18 where @xmath19 and the @xmath20 is the fermi distribution function for the fermion component with spin projection @xmath11 at temperature @xmath21 ( @xmath22 )    @xmath23    the single particle energy @xmath24 will be especified for each interaction model that will be used in this work , see below .",
    "the magnetization in the neutron plasma is defined as    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the neutron magnetic moment in units of the nuclear magneton  @xcite and @xmath27 is the spin excess or polarization of the system @xmath28      we have considered , in first place , the phenomenological skyrme interaction that appears in the literature under a rather general form  @xcite @xmath29   \\nonumber \\\\ & & +   t_2 \\left(1+x_2 p^{\\sigma } \\right ) { \\bf k ' } \\cdot \\delta({\\bf r } ) { \\bf k } + \\frac{1}{6 } t_3 \\left(1+x_3 p^{\\sigma } \\right ) \\rho^{\\alpha } ( { \\bf r})\\delta({\\bf r } )   \\label{skyrme}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 and @xmath31 , @xmath32 the relative momentum acting on the right and @xmath33 its conjugate acting on the left .",

    "we will keep the notation using @xmath42 to designate the total magnetic field strength .",
    "in addition we will use capital letters for any extensive magnitude , a , and , for its associated intensive magnitude ( per particle ) , the same letter in lower - case , a = a / n .    using the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock approximation ,",

    "<S> some thermodynamical magnitudes of interest in a pure neutron plasma are studied within the framework of the non - relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock approximation at finite density and temperature . </S>",
    "<S> we use skyrme and gogny forces to describe such a neutron plasma and study the main differences that arise in these two effective parametrizations of the nuclear interaction when a strong magnetic field induces a permanent magnetization in the gas . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of a non - zero permanent spin polarization in a neutron plasma is explored in the density - temperature parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> we find that for moderate temperatures and in the low density range up to densities @xmath0 both parametrizations predict that as density decreases an increasingly strong magnetization is allowed . in the range </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 there is an approximately constant polarization that can be as big as @xmath2 for the maximum allowed interior magnetic field @xmath3 g. for higher densities there is a dramatic difference in the polarization trend followed by skyrme an gogny forces . while the former predict a ferromagnetic phase transition , the gogny forces prevent it keeping the magnetization below @xmath4 . </S>"
