    "when the supersonic solar wind flows past the moon , it leaves a cavity behind the moon known as lunar plasma wake .",
    "recent observations in the near - lunar wake region ( 100 km to 200 km from the surface ) have revealed the presence of protons @xcite . these protons , which are basically solar wind protons ,",
    "reach the near - lunar wake due to various processes @xcite .",
    "protons were found to enter the lunar wake parallel to the direction of interplanetary magnetic field ( imf ) at 100 km from the lunar surface by sara / chandrayaan-1 @xcite .",
    "these observations were at solar zenith angle ( sza ) of @xmath0140@xmath1  ( 50@xmath1  behind the terminator ) and the imf was dominantly perpendicular to solar wind velocity .",
    "the energy of the protons was higher compared to that of solar wind and the density was around 0.1% of the solar wind proton density .",
    "the simple 1-d model for the plasma expansion into the vacuum @xcite did not explain the presence of these protons . in the mid - wake region of @xmath03.5 r@xmath2 downstream ( r@xmath2 refers to radius of the moon ) , artemis has also observed protons parallel to imf @xcite .",
    "these observations were found to be in agreement with the 1-d plasma expansion model at this distance .",
    "recently , @xcite have investigated the one - dimensional solutions for parallel filling of the wake using hot ion distributions ( rather than the conventional cold ion approximation ) and using maxwellian as well as kappa distribution functions for the solar wind electrons .",
    "the solutions were compared with artemis observations and found to be in agreement .",
    "several observations have also shown that the protons enter the near - wake in a direction perpendicular to the imf .",
    "@xcite have reported observations at 100 km altitude and sza closer to 150@xmath1 .",
    "these protons from the solar wind enter into the near - lunar wake due to an increase in their gyro - radii under the influence of the electric field at the wake boundary .",
    "@xcite have reported protons at 100 km altitude closer to sza of 168@xmath1 .",
    "these protons had a wider energy range : starting from lower than that of solar wind to well above the solar wind energy .",
    "the maximum energy observed was around six times that of solar wind .",
    "backtracing of these protons showed that they are solar wind protons scattered at larger angles upon interaction with the dayside lunar surface @xcite .",
    "their trajectories under the influence of the imf and the convective electric field of the solar wind ( @xmath3 ) provide access to the deeper lunar wake .",
    "@xcite have reported protons in the near - lunar wake closer to the terminator regions of moon .",
    "closer to the terminator , these protons had energies less than that of solar wind , whereas their energy was found to increase further inside the lunar wake . these protons , which travel dominantly perpendicular to imf , were proposed to be the solar wind protons that are forward scattered from the lunar surface closer to the terminator region .    in all the above reported events the background imf was dominantly perpendicular to the solar wind velocity ( flow ) .",
    "later , @xcite showed that the mechanism by which the surface scattered protons reaches the wake @xcite operates for other imf orientations also , except perfectly aligned flow , where the convective electric field , @xmath4 . @xcite",
    "have reported the proton observation in the low - altitude ( 100 km ) wake when the imf was aligned with the solar wind flow , a case where parallel entry along imf as well as perpendicular entry under the influence of convective electric field can not play a role .",
    "the energy of the observed protons were higher than that of average solar wind energy by few 100 ev .",
    "those protons are from the higher energy tail of the solar wind velocity distribution .",
    "they access the deeper wake due to their larger gyro - radius .    in the context of entry of the protons to the near - lunar wake by various mechanisms",
    ", we have investigated the characteristics of velocity distribution of the protons in the low - altitude ( 100 km to 200 km from the surface ) wake by using all the available data from the solar wind monitor ( swim ) sensor of the sara ( sub - kev atom reflecting analyser ) experiment on chandrayaan-1 .",
    "this will help us to understand the different proton populations in the lunar wake .",
    "the solar wind monitor ( swim ) was one of the two sensors of the sara experiment on chandrayaan-1 mission @xcite , which was a polar orbiting satellite around the moon .",
    "swim was an ion - mass analyser with a fan - shaped field of view ( fov ) .",
    "the swim fov was divided into 16 angular pixels of resolution @xmath5@xmath1  ( elevation)@xmath6@xmath1  ( azimuth ) , depending on the viewing direction .",
    "the energy coverage of swim was 1003000 ev / q with @xmath7e / e @xmath07% .",
    "swim measured ion flux in logarithmically separated 16 energy steps .",
    "the measurement for one energy and direction takes 31.25 ms .",
    "the swim fov plane was almost perpendicular to the velocity vector of the spacecraft .",
    "one edge of the fan - shaped fov looks toward the moon and the other to the zenith .",
    "assisted by the nadir - pointing spacecraft motion , the fov covers @xmath8 ( half hemisphere ) within half of the orbit .",
    "however , this means that the swim fov plane changes its orientation according to the latitude .",
    "the fov plane is in the ecliptic plane closer to the equator and it was perpendicular to the ecliptic plane closer to the poles ( more details about fov orientation can be found in futaana et al . , 2010 and dhanya et al . , 2013 )",
    "due to the motion of earth around the sun , the orbital plane of chandrayaan  -1 had a drift of @xmath01@xmath1  per day with respect to the sun .",
    "this helps to have swim observations closer to the dawn - dusk terminator ( march  april 2009 ) as well as in the noon - midnight plane ( june  july 2009 ) .",
    "chandrayaan-1 was in a 100 km circular orbit till mid may 2009 ; subsequently , the orbit was raised to 200 km .",
    "the swim data obtained from both altitudes ( january  july 2009 period ) are considered for the analysis in this paper . after excluding the days when the moon was in the earth s magnetosheath and magnetotail , about 500 orbits of observation data in total is used in the analysis .    for the upstream solar wind parameters , such as solar wind velocity , density , and imf orientation",
    ", we have used level-2 data from the swepam and mag instruments on the ace satellite .",
    "since ace makes measurements near the l1 point , the data have been time - shifted to the location of moon by considering the solar wind speed and distance of ace from the moon at each instant .",
    "for the analysis , we have used mainly two co - ordinate systems : + ( 1 ) aberrated lunar - centric solar ecliptic ( alse ) co - ordinate system , and + ( 2 ) lunar solar wind electric field ( lswe ) co - ordinates . + in alse co - ordinate system",
    ", the @xmath9-axis is towards the anti - solar wind velocity ( @xmath10 ) which has been corrected for aberration due to the motion of earth - moon system , the @xmath11-axis is towards ecliptic north and @xmath12-axis completes the right handed co - ordinate system .    in lswe co",

    "ordinates , imf ( @xmath14 ) will be confined in the @xmath9-@xmath12 plane with the @xmath12-component always positive .",
    "the processes by which the protons enter the near lunar wake may depend on the orientation of imf and the convective electric field , whose direction varies .",
    "the lswe co - ordinate system helps to confine the direction of imf in specific plane and that of the convective electric field in particular direction .",
    "-axis is along anti - solar wind velocity , @xmath11-axis is along the convective electric field of the solar wind ( @xmath15 ) and the @xmath12-axis completes the right handed co - ordinate system . in this co - ordinate system imf ( @xmath16 ) will be confined in the @xmath9-@xmath12 plane with the @xmath12-component always positive ( sample direction as red dotted arrow ) . ]    in addition , we have used the solar wind rest frame , which is a frame moving with the solar wind and hence the convective electric field is zero .",
    "this frame has been used to discuss the velocity distribution function of protons in the wake where proton velocities are resolved into components having direction parallel and perpendicular to the imf .",
    "swim made observations in the lunar wake in every orbit , initially from 100 km altitude , and later from 200 km altitude .",
    "the location of the observations in the lunar wake in lswe ( spacecraft location ) are binned into grid cells of size 100 km @xmath17 100 km .",
    "the differential flux observed by swim when the spacecraft was located over any grid cell is accumulated in that grid cell .",
    "since there will be multiple observations over any grid cell , due to repeated orbits , the accumulated counts on a given grid cell is divided by the number of observations in that grid cell to get the average differential flux .",
    "the 2d maps of the number of observations in the lunar wake and the observed differential flux , projected in different planes of the lswe co - ordinates are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : maplsew ] .",
    "the top panels ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maplsew]a to fig .",
    "[ fig : maplsew]e ) show the 2-d map of number of observations projected onto different planes . in most cases ,",
    "there are several observations over a given location .",
    "the corresponding differential flux has an asymmetry along the @xmath18-axis ( @xmath3 ) , with higher differential flux at the @xmath19 ( @xmath20 ) hemisphere compared to the @xmath21 ( @xmath18 ) hemisphere within few 100 kms from the terminator ( strip in red color seen fig .",
    "[ fig : maplsew]i compared to fig .",
    "[ fig : maplsew]j ) .",
    "this asymmetry may be due to the role of the electric field in aiding the entry of protons to near - wake across the @xmath19 pole .",
    "similarly , the differential flux is asymmetric along @xmath12 , with the flux in @xmath22 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maplsew]g ) being higher than in @xmath23 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : maplsew]h ) , closer to limb .",
    "since imf lies in the @xmath9-@xmath12 plane with @xmath12-component always positive , the asymmetry between @xmath22 and @xmath23 may be associated with the diffusion of solar wind parallel ( @xmath22 ) and anti - parallel to imf ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "hence , for further analysis we have chosen five locations as shown in fig .",

    "the locations 1 to 4 are at a distance of 1500 km to 1700 km from the centre of the wake . due to the finite gyro - radius of protons in the solar wind , there is always a possibility for protons to be found in lunar wake close to the terminator . hence the observations very close to the terminator ( limb observations ) are excluded .",

    "the velocity distribution functions are indeed functions of three dimensional velocity space , but to understand the population in a simple manner , we used the two dimensional velocity space , namely in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the imf ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) . note that we employ the solar wind rest frame for this analysis . indeed this frame",

    "<S> due to the high absorption of solar wind plasma on the lunar dayside , a large scale wake structure is formed downstream of the moon . however , recent in - situ observations have revealed the presence of protons in the near - lunar wake ( 100 km to 200 km from the surface ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solar wind , either directly or after interaction with the lunar surface ( including magnetic anomalies ) , is the source of these protons in the near - wake region . using the entire data from the swim sensor of the sara experiment onboard chandrayaan-1 , we analysed the velocity distribution of the protons observed in the near - lunar wake . </S>",
    "<S> the average velocity distribution functions , computed in the solar wind rest frame , were further separated based on the angle between the upstream solar wind velocity and the imf . although the protons enter the wake parallel as well as perpendicular to the imf , the velocity distribution were not identical for the different imf orientations , indicating the control of imf in the proton entry processes . </S>",
    "<S> several proton populations were identified from the velocity distribution and their possible entry mechanism were inferred based on the characteristics of the velocity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> these entry mechanisms include ( i ) diffusion of solar wind protons into the wake along imf , ( ii ) the solar wind protons with finite gyro - radii that are aided by the wake boundary electric field , ( iii ) solar wind protons with gyro - radii larger than lunar radii from the tail of the solar wind velocity distribution , and ( iv ) scattering of solar wind protons from the dayside lunar surface or from magnetic anomalies . in order to gain more insight into the entry mechanisms associated with different populations , </S>",
    "<S> backtracing is carried out for each of these populations . for most of the populations , </S>",
    "<S> the source of the protons obtained from backtracing is found to be in agreement with that inferred from the velocity distribution . </S>",
    "<S> there are few populations that could not be explained by the known mechanisms and remain unknown .    </S>",
