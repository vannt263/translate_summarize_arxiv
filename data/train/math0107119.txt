    "the periodic function @xmath4 has the following remarkable property : for every rational number @xmath5 , @xmath6 gives an algebraic number , while for every non - rational algebraic number @xmath5 , it gives a transcendental number .",
    "it follows that if @xmath4 is algebraic and @xmath5 is not rational , then @xmath5 is transcendental .",
    "this somewhat reciprocal algebraicity - transcendence relation between the periods of a function and its values is commonly seen among the periodic functions appearing in algebraic geometry such as modular functions and theta functions @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to examine a similar relation between the periods of strebel differentials on a complete nonsingular algebraic curve and its field of definition . in an earlier paper @xcite",
    ", we have established that if a compact riemann surface @xmath2 admits a strebel differential @xmath1 such that the length of every _ critical horizontal trajectory _",
    "is rational , then @xmath2 is the complex model of an algebraic curve defined over the field @xmath0 of algebraic numbers .",
    "( we refer to @xcite for the definitions of the notions used in this article . )",
    "let us call the length of a critical horizontal trajectory a _ period _ of @xmath1 .",
    "thus the rationality of the periods makes the field of definition of @xmath2 algebraic . following the analogy of the relation between the periods and the values of theta functions ,",
    "one can ask questions about the transcendence of the periods of a strebel differential and the field of definition of an algebraic curve .    let @xmath7 be a _ ribbon graph _ , that is , a graph with a prescribed cyclic order of half - edges at each vertex . a ribbon graph is a _",
    "metric _ ribbon graph if a positive real number , conventionally referred to as the _ length _ , is assigned to each edge . from every metric ribbon graph @xmath7",
    ", one can construct a compact riemann surface @xmath2 and a _ strebel differential _",
    "@xmath1 on it in a unique manner .",
    "the number of poles of @xmath1 is equal to the number of _ boundary circuits _ of @xmath7 , and the residue of @xmath3 at each pole is the total length of the boundary circuit corresponding to the pole .",
    "conversely , starting with a compact riemann surface @xmath2 with @xmath8 marked points and an @xmath9-tuple of positive real numbers , one constructs a unique metric ribbon graph as the union of the critical horizontal trajectories of the strebel differential @xmath1 on @xmath2 .",
    "the integral of @xmath3 between zeros of @xmath1 along a critical horizontal trajectory is called a _ period _ of @xmath1 . the periods of the strebel differential determine a metric on the ribbon graph .",
    "harer @xcite used this idea to establish an orbifold isomorphism @xmath10 where @xmath7 runs over all ribbon graphs with valence of each vertex no less than 3 and with euler characteristic @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the number of edges of @xmath7 , @xmath13 is the group of ribbon graph automorphisms of @xmath7 that fix its boundary circuits , and @xmath14 is the moduli space of smooth compact complex algebraic curves of genus @xmath15 with @xmath9 ordered marked points .",
    "this isomorphism plays a key role in many recent papers ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for an explicit construction of this isomorphism",
    ", we refer to @xcite .",
    "the set of _ rational points _",
    "@xmath16 is well defined ( although not as an orbifold over @xmath17 ) because a ribbon graph automorphism acts as a permutation of edges .",
    "let @xmath18 denote the moduli space of @xmath9-pointed complete nonsingular algebraic curves defined over @xmath0 .",
    "comparing belyi s theorem @xcite , grothendieck s idea of _ dessins denfants _ @xcite , and strebel theory @xcite , we have established in @xcite that there is a natural injective map @xmath19 : @xmath20 belyi s theorem shows that _ every _ complete nonsingular algebraic curve over @xmath0 is constructed as the image of the map @xmath19 _ if _ we do not specify the number @xmath9 of marked points .",
    "however , in the light of the geometric @xmath21 actions @xcite , @xmath19 can not be surjective .",
    "indeed , we shall prove the following :    [ th : main ] let @xmath2 be an arbitrary complete nonsingular algebraic curve defined over @xmath0 . then there is a strebel differential @xmath1 on the complex model of @xmath2 such that    1 .",
    "every pole of @xmath1 is a @xmath0-rational point of @xmath2 ; 2 .",
    "the residue of @xmath3 at each pole is a positive integer ; and 3 .",
    "@xmath1 has a transcendental period .",
    "the authors would like to thank josephine yu for creating the graphics figure  [ fig : gammay ] and figure  [ fig : gammac ] in this paper .",
    "let us start by constructing a simple example on @xmath22 .",
    "we wish to exhibit a strebel differential @xmath23 on @xmath22 that has poles at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 has residues 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 , and 2 , resp .",
    ", at these poles , with @xmath30 a constant to be determined later .",

    "first we choose @xmath32 since @xmath33 @xmath31 is ramified at @xmath34 .",
    "we note that @xmath35 the other rational map is @xmath36 consider the meromorphic quadratic differential @xmath37 on @xmath22 , and put @xmath38 it has quadratic poles at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , and simple zeros at @xmath39 .",

    "it has been shown in @xcite that @xmath44 is the ribbon graph consisting of the set of critical trajectories of the strebel differential @xmath42 .",
    "next , let @xmath45 be a real algebraic number such that @xmath46 , choose the constant @xmath27 so that @xmath47 and define @xmath48 . since the two critical values of the double - sheeted holomorphic covering map @xmath31 are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , one sees that the strebel differential @xmath23 on @xmath22 has quadratic poles at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 with residues of @xmath29 at these poles 2 , 2 , 2 , 4 , and 2 , resp . , and a new double zero at @xmath51 .",
    "let @xmath52 .",
    "because of the choice of @xmath27 in eq .",
    "[ eq : c ] , @xmath53 is the ribbon graph consisting of the critical trajectories for the strebel differential @xmath23 .",
    "it has four tri - valent vertices at @xmath54 and a unique 4-valent vertex at @xmath55 .",
    "let @xmath56 denote the edge of @xmath53 that connects the vertex @xmath51 and one of the tri - valent vertices . from eq .",
    "[ eq : q ] one sees that the period of @xmath23 corresponding to the edge @xmath56 is equal to @xmath57 depending on the choice of the tri - valent vertex , where @xmath58 in section  [ sect : trans ] , we shall show that @xmath59 is transcendent at @xmath60 for every rational number @xmath61 such that @xmath62 .",
    "the above construction immediately gives the construction of the strebel differential @xmath1 for the general case of theorem  [ th : main ] .",
    "let @xmath2 be an arbitrary complete nonsingular algebraic curve defined over @xmath0 .",
    "belyi @xcite has shown that there is a holomorphic map @xmath63 that is ramified only over @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the map @xmath64 is called a _",
    "belyi map_. without loss of generality , we can assume that the ramification degrees over the point @xmath65 are no less than 3 and the ramification degrees over @xmath66 are always 2 .",
    "define @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "then @xmath1 is the strebel differential on @xmath2 with poles at @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and @xmath73 .",
    "the residue of @xmath3 at each of these poles is 2 times the ramification degree of @xmath64 at each ramification point , 4 at each inverse image of @xmath27 , and 2 at each inverse image of @xmath28 .",
    "certainly the period of @xmath1 corresponding to any edge of @xmath7 that is an inverse image of @xmath56 is a transcendental number if we chose @xmath74 .",
    "let us now show that @xmath59 of eq .",
    "[ eq : ell ] is transcendental for every @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is a rational number in between @xmath24 and @xmath75 .",
    "since @xmath76 the claim follows from      let @xmath81 this is a solution of the quadratic equation @xmath82 .",
    "let @xmath83 be an irreducible fraction .",
    "then @xmath84 is primitive and irreducible if @xmath9 is odd , and if @xmath85 , then @xmath86 is primitive and irreducible .",
    "suppose that @xmath87 .",
    "then @xmath88 is a solution of the primitive equation @xmath89 for some integer @xmath90 .",
    "we note that the primitive minimal polynomial of @xmath88 divides @xmath91 . therefore , if @xmath9 is odd , then @xmath92 , and hence @xmath93 , which is a contradiction . if @xmath9 is even , then @xmath94 and the only possibility is @xmath95 .",
    "thus @xmath80 is not rational .",
    "it can not be algebraic because @xmath88 is algebraic .",
    "this completes the proof",
    ".    it would be desirable to establish that if a compact riemann surface @xmath2 admits a strebel differential @xmath1 whose periods are algebraic but not rational , then the geometric data @xmath96 , where @xmath97 are the poles of @xmath1 , can not be defined over @xmath0 . in our simple example of section  [ sect : strebel ] , if the period corresponding to the edge @xmath56 is taken to be algebraic but not rational , then the ramification points @xmath27 and @xmath28 become transcendental .",
