    "despite the fact that the standard model of the electroweak interactions @xcite agrees extraordinarily well with all existing measurements @xcite there is a widespread conviction that it is nothing more than a low energy limit of a more fundamental theory @xcite .",
    "an approach which is receiving growing attention is to represent new physics by additional terms in an effective lagrangian expansion and then to constrain the coefficients of the effective lagrangian by precision experimental measurements @xcite .",
    "the bounds obtained on the coefficients can then be related to possible theories of new physics .",
    "for example , this approach has been used by a number of authors to bound dimension four operators which can contribute to the vacuum polarization tensors of the massive gauge bosons via a global analysis of neutral current data @xcite .",
    "these bounds have put severe constraints on technicolour theories of dynamical symmetry breaking .",

    "although bounds can be extracted from high precision low energy measurements and measurements at the @xmath14 pole , there are ambiguities and model dependencies in the results @xcite . in contrast ,",
    "gauge boson production at colliders can measure the gauge boson couplings directly and unambiguously .",
    "the direct measurement of these parameters is at present very weak , with the most constraining limits coming from the ua2 experiment which gives @xmath15 and @xmath16 at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite . putting tight constraints on the trilinear gauge boson couplings is one of the primary motivations for the lep200 upgrade @xcite .",
    "the tevatron and hera will also be able to measure these vertices @xcite but precise direct measurement to the level of several percent will have to wait until the era of ssc and lhc @xcite .",

    "in contrast to other analysis @xcite we include the decay of the @xmath0 boson to final state fermions along with contributions to the final state that do not proceed via an intermediate @xmath0 boson . at high energy",
    "this provides additional information off the @xmath0 resonance through the interference of the various diagrams .",
    "we begin by reexamining the @xmath18 gev collider which was previously studied assuming a delta function photon spectrum with the photon energy equal to that of the original electron beam . here",
    "we include a realistic backscattered laser spectrum .",
    "we next consider single @xmath0 production at a 200 gev @xmath4 collider as a competing process to @xmath0 pair production .",
    "finally we consider @xmath0 production at 500 gev and 1 tev @xmath4 colliders and compare the sensitivities achievable using a backscattered laser photon spectrum and a beamstrahlung photon spectrum .    in the next section",

    "within the standard model the @xmath2 vertex is uniquely determined by @xmath19 gauge invariance so that a precise measurement of the vertex poses a severe test of the gauge structure of the theory .",
    "the most general @xmath2 vertex , consistent with lorentz invariance , can be parametrized in terms of seven form factors when the w bosons couple to essentially massless fermions which effectively results in @xmath20 @xcite . for on shell photons ,",
    "electromagnetic gauge invariance further restricts the tensor structure of the @xmath2 vertex to allow only four free parameters , two of which violate cp invariance .",

    "these order of magnitude estimates are confirmed by explicit calculation . the contribution of the @xmath36-quark results in @xmath37 and @xmath38 while a sm higgs boson of mass 200 gev contributes @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "technicolour theories give @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite and supersymmetric theories give @xmath43 and @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "what one gleans from these numbers is that a deviation of more than a couple of percent would be difficult to accomodate in the sm and in general , contributions via loop corrections typically contribute no more than a couple of percent . although it might be possible to find models that give slightly larger contributions , for example models with @xmath45 mixing @xcite or models with many particles which contribute coherently to loop contributions",
    "@xcite , if deviations much larger than several percent are observed this would signal something very radical such as composite gauge bosons @xcite .",
    "since we know of no convincing models of this sort , to probe for new physics via anomalous trilinear gauge boson couplings one must be able to measure the vertex to the level of a few percent .",
    "deviations from the standard model ( @xmath46 , @xmath47 ) lead to amplitudes which grow with energy and therefore violate unitarity at high energy @xcite .",
    "one method of avoiding violation of the unitarity bound is to include a momentum dependence in the form factors , @xmath48 , so that the deviations vanish when either @xmath49 or @xmath50 , the absolute square of the four momentum of the vector bosons , becomes large @xcite .",

    "the background processes our calculation includes all the diagrams of fig 2 for arbitrary values of @xmath5 and @xmath12 . to obtain the cross sections and distributions we used the calkul helicity amplitude technique @xcite which for completeness we summarize in appendix a along with the amplitudes corresponding to fig .",
    "2 . monte carlo integration techniques are then used to perform the phase space integrals @xcite .",
    "we treat the photon distributions as structure functions , @xmath57 and integrate them with the @xmath1 cross sections to obtain our results : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the fraction of the original electron energy carried by the photon . for completeness and for the convenience of the interested reader",
    "we include the various photon distributions in appendix b. for our numerical results we take @xmath60 , @xmath61 gev , @xmath62 gev , @xmath63 .    the signal we are studying consists of either , ( i ) for leptonic @xmath0 decay , a high transverse momentum lepton ( @xmath64 ) and large missing transverse momentum ( @xmath65 ) due to the neutrinos from the initial electron beam and from the @xmath0 decay , or ( ii ) for hadronic @xmath0 decay , two hadronic jets and large missing transverse momentum ( @xmath65 ) due to the neutrino from the initial electron beam . in both cases , we require that visible particles in the final state be at least @xmath66 from the beam direction . our conclusions are not sensitive to the exact value of this cut .",
    "we also impose a cut on the minimum @xmath65 ; for @xmath3  gev and 200  gev we used @xmath67  gev and for @xmath68  gev and 1  tev we used @xmath69  gev .",
    "we do not include fragmentation and hadronization effects for the hadronic modes and identify the hadron jet momenta with that of the quarks .",
    "the signals we consider are therefore @xmath70 we also examined the reaction @xmath71 which includes the process @xmath72 in addition to the diagrams of figure 2 .",
    "however , once kinematic cuts are imposed that eliminate the uninteresting contributions from @xmath73 we are left with results comparable to the @xmath74 mode .    in the following subsections we study single @xmath0 production for @xmath3  gev , 200  gev , 500  gev , and 1  tev . in doing",
    "so we examine a number of kinematic distributions , asymmetries , and ratios of observables for their sensitivity to anomalous gauge boson couplings .",
    "since we will only present results for the observables most sensitive to the gauge boson couplings , at this point we list all observables that we studied . for the leptonic @xmath0 decay modes we considered ; @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 , where @xmath78 is the angle between the incoming electron and the outgoing muon , @xmath79 , @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the cross section for @xmath82 and @xmath83 is the total cross section with the kinematic cuts given above .",
    "when backscattered laser photons are used we can form the ratio @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the cross section for the mainly helicity 1/2 amplitudes which result when the incident photons are left handed and @xmath86 is the cross section for the mainly helicity 3/2 amplitudes when the incident photons are right handed . for the hadronic @xmath0 decay modes we reconstructed the @xmath0 boson 4-momentum from the hadronic jets 4-momentum , imposing the kinematic cut of 75 gev @xmath87 85 gev . including the nonresonant diagrams of fig ( 2c ) and ( 2d ) and reconstructing the @xmath0 boson in this manner",
    "gives different results than from simply studying the cross sections to @xmath0 bosons .",
    "finally , in some cases , which we will describe in further detail below , we studied the effect of anomalous couplings on the cross section of the hadronic modes _ off _ the @xmath0 pole ( i.e. @xmath88 ) .",
    "in general , deviations of the gauge boson couplings had a very substantial effect on the cross section off the @xmath0 resonance although , because of the reduced cross section , the statistical significance is not really enhanced .",
    "this does , however , point out the importance of considering the process that is actually measured , not simply a theorist s idealization .",
    "0.5 cm    a. @xmath3 gev    in previous papers the @xmath18 gev @xmath1 collider was examined in detail assuming the photon energy was equal to that of the original electron beam @xcite .",
    "however when we folded in the backscattered photon spectrum , the cross section was reduced by an order of magnitude to 0.03 pb for the muon mode and 0.06 pb for the @xmath89 mode , with the cuts described above and the cuts we used . ] which yields an event rate too low to perform a useful physics analysis with integrated luminosities of @xmath90 pb@xmath91 .",
    "the reason for the reduced cross section is not hard to see ; the backscattered photon spectrum peaks at about 0.84 of the original beam energy . for electron beams of 50 gev",
    "this results in @xmath92 gev which is just barely above the @xmath0 production threshold where the cross section is still relatively small .",
    "we therefore studied the physics potential for an increased beam energy of 60 gev ( @xmath3  gev ) , perhaps from a hypothetically upgraded slc collider . the modest increase in energy results in almost an order of magnitude increase in the cross section ; 0.12 pb for the muon mode and 0.53 pb for the hadronic mode with the kinematic cuts we used .    of the observables listed in the previous section , those involving the reconstructed @xmath0 from the hadronic decay modes were the most sensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "this is simply due to the factor of six larger @xmath0 branching fraction of the hadronic modes relative to the muon mode .",
    "the specific observables found to be most sensitive are the total cross section ( @xmath93 ) , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and binning the angular distribution into two bins ; @xmath96 and @xmath97 . the @xmath0 angular distribution for @xmath98 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 with and without the backscattered photon distribution folded in .",
    "when the photon spectrum is included the angular distribution is shifted in the forward direction and the radiation zero at @xmath99 is totally eliminated . in fig .",
    "4 we show the 95% c.l .",
    "contours obtained using @xmath93 and @xmath100 based on the statistical errors obtained by assuming 100 pb@xmath91 and 500 pb@xmath91 of integrated luminosity . to obtain these curves we calculated the observables for a given value of @xmath5 and @xmath12 and determined at what level the value , if measured , would be compatible with the standard model prediction .",
    "the central region is the 95% c.l .",
    "bound obtainable from the combined measurements .",
    "we obtain similar results by combining @xmath96 and @xmath97 , the cross sections in the forward and backward directions respectively .",
    "the inclusion of @xmath101 would improve the bounds on the right side of the curves ( + ve @xmath12 ) slightly .",
    "these results do not depend on whether or not we use the cuts on @xmath102 indicating that the hadronic cross section is dominated by the @xmath0 boson pole .",
    "varying one parameter at a time and holding the other fixed at its standard model value we obtain @xmath103 and @xmath104 at 95% c.l .. the bounds that could be achieved using the various observables are given in table i. the constraints that could be obtained on @xmath5 would be comparable to that obtainable at lep200 but the limits on @xmath12 would be about a factor of two less stringent .",
    "0.5 cm    b. @xmath105 gev ; lep 200    at lep 200 the possibility of @xmath1 collisions is only possible via t - channel photon exchange between the electron and positron beams @xcite .",
    "we therefore examine single @xmath0 production in @xmath4 collisions by folding the cross sections for @xmath106 and @xmath107 with the weizacker - williams photon distribution .    as in the @xmath3  gev case we found that distributions utilizing @xmath0 s reconstructed from the hadronic modes were most sensitive to the @xmath2 couplings .",
    "this is primarily due to the increased statistics of the hadronic modes over the leptonic modes since the bounds obtained at 200 gev are limited by statistics ; @xmath108  pb vs @xmath109  pb ( with the cut on @xmath102 ) .",
    "we found that deviations in the total cross section and the angular distribution of the reconstructed @xmath0 gave the greatest sensitivity to anomalous couplings . in fig .",
    "5 we show the angular distribution of the reconstructed @xmath0 s . to obtain sensitivity bounds we used the total cross section and @xmath100 of the reconstructed @xmath0 boson .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "limits are given in fig .",
    "6 along with the combined bounds . as in the @xmath3  gev case",
    "the `` binned '' @xmath96 and @xmath97 gives almost identical constraints .",
    "the 95% c.l .",
    "limits obtained by varying one parameter at a time , for @xmath110  pb@xmath91 , are @xmath111 and @xmath112 from @xmath113 .",
    "the bounds that could be achieved using the different observables are listed in table ii .",
    "the sensitivity on @xmath5 is comparable to that obtained from the @xmath0-pair production process but offers a means of measuring the @xmath2 vertex independently of the @xmath7 vertex and is therefore an important complement to the @xmath0-pair production process .",
    "another possible kinematic variable is the @xmath89 invariant mass , @xmath102 which we plot in fig .",
    "7 for representative values of @xmath5 and @xmath12 . at the high mass regions the deviations are at least comparable to the deviations at the @xmath0-pole .",
    "the cross section is , however , too small to yield useful statistics , at least in the weizacker - williams approximation . calculating the single @xmath0 production cross section exactly , and including all the diagrams contributing to the same final state appears to offer an increase in the cross section in the high mass region and is undergoing detailed investigation which will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the important point is that the normally neglected nonresonant diagrams which contribute to the final state can , and often do , make a non - negligible contribution to the cross section and should not be neglected",
    ".    0.5 cm    c. the next linear collider ; @xmath68 gev and @xmath114 gev    for the nlc @xcite we consider two possibilities for the photon spectrum ; that arising from backscattering a laser from one of the original electron beams and beamstralung , which is the radiation which arises when two intense beams of electrons pass through one another . for the results using the beamstrahlung photon spectrum we concentrate on the beam spectrum resulting from the g set of parameters of ref .",
    "we will discuss the effect of different beam parameters on our results .",
    "we included the weizacker - williams contributions in our beamstrahlung results .",
    "the nlc is envisaged as a very high luminosity collider so that the number of events per unit of r , the qed point cross section , which is an s - channel process and goes like @xmath115 , remains reasonable .",
    "the integrated luminosities for a snowmass year ( @xmath116 sec ) are expected to be @xmath117 fb@xmath91 for a @xmath68 gev collider and @xmath118 fb@xmath91 for a @xmath119  tev collider .",
    "typical cross sections for the process @xmath120 and @xmath121 at @xmath68 gev are 3.2 pb and 16.6 pb respectively for the backscattered laser mode and 2.1 pb and 10.8 pb respectively for the beamstrahlung mode , leading to @xmath122 events per year . at @xmath119  tev @xmath123  pb and @xmath124  pb for the backscattered laser mode and @xmath125  pb and @xmath126  pb for the beamstrahlung mode leading to @xmath127 events / year . thus , except for certain regions of phase space , the errors are not limited by statistics , but rather by systematic errors .",
    "factors entering into systematic errors include an accurate knowledge of the total luminosity , particle misidentification , triggering and detector efficiencies , uncertainty in the size of backgrounds , calorimetric accuracy etc . estimating systematic errors requires detailed monte carlo studies which we do not attempt .",
    "for cross sections we assume a systematic error of 5% and for asymmetries and ratios , where some of the systematic errors cancel , we assume a systematic error of 3% @xcite . we consider the effects of reducing these systematic errors on the achievable sensitivities . in our results",
    "we combine in quadrature the statistical errors based on the integrated luminosities given above with the systematic errors : @xmath128    we begin with @xmath68  gev . as in the previous cases for @xmath3 gev and",
    "@xmath105 gev the total cross sections and the angular distributions of the outgoing muon and reconstructed @xmath0 are sensitive to anomalous couplings .",
    "we plot the distributions for both the backscattered photon case and the beamstrahlung case in fig .",
    "8 . at higher energies we can obtain additional information , especially for @xmath12 , from the @xmath64 spectrum of the outgoing lepton or the reconstructed @xmath0 .",
    "we show these spectra in fig .",
    "9 . finally , as already pointed out , the invariant mass distribution , shown in fig .",
    "10 , of the @xmath89 pair above the @xmath0 mass also provides useful information .",
    "if , for example , we integrate the @xmath102 spectrum from 100 gev up , we obtain a cross section of 0.25 pb for the backscattered laser mode which offers considerable statistics . for @xmath129  gev , @xmath130  pb which yields @xmath131 events / year .",
    "more importantly , this high @xmath102 region shows a higher sensitivity to anomalous couplings than the @xmath30 pole region .    to quantify the observations of the above paragraph we consider the cross sections , the angular distributions , and the @xmath64 distributions for the muon and hadronic modes and the hadronic cross section for @xmath132 gev . for the angular distributions we used four equal bins and for the @xmath64 distributions we used the 4 @xmath64 bins ; @xmath133  gev , 100 - 150  gev , 150 - 200  gev , and 200 - 250  gev .",
    "the bounds obtained for these observables are shown in fig .",
    "11 based on systematic errors of 5% .",
    "bounds obtained by varying one parameter at a time are summarized in table iii . in general the limits on @xmath5",
    "obtained using the beamstrahlung spectrum are comparable to those obtained from the backscattered photon spectrum .",
    "the bounds on @xmath12 are tighter using the backscattered laser photons which reflects the harder photon spectrum in this case to which @xmath12 is more sensitive .",
    "we find that @xmath5 can be measured to within 7% and @xmath12 to within @xmath134 at 95% c.l .",
    ", using the backscattered laser approach , which is approaching the sensitivity required to observe the contributions of new physics at the level of loop corrections .",
    "unlike the case at lower energies , the limits from the muon mode and reconstructed @xmath0 mode are comparable .",
    "this is due to two reasons : first , while the @xmath0 mode is restricted to the small portion of the phase space at the @xmath0 mass .",
    "in contrast , the muon mode reflects the entire kinematically allowed region , in particular the highest energy region where deviations from the standard model are most pronounced .",
    "although the diagram we are interested in does not dominate in this higher energy region , the interference between it and the non - resonant diagrams are important . once again",
    ", this underlines the importance of considering all contributions to the process that will actually be observed and only then impose constraints .",
    "furthermore , because of the large expected integrated luminosities the errors are dominated by systematic errors so that the differences between the hadronic and leptonic branching fractions become unimportant .",
    "we repeat the above exercise for @xmath119 tev using an integrated luminosity of 200  fb@xmath91 . as was the case at 500 gev",
    "we find that the angular and @xmath135 distributions give the best constraints on anomalous couplings .",
    "these distributions are shown in fig .",
    "12 and 13 and are seen to be qualitatively similar to the 500 gev distributions .",
    "the invariant mass distributions of the @xmath89 pair is very similar to the 500 gev except that it extends out about a factor of two further . to extract bounds from these distributions we divided the angular distributions into four equal bins and the @xmath135 distribution into the four bins ;",
    "@xmath136  gev , 200 - 300  gev , 300 - 400  gev , and 400 - 500  gev . at 1 tev",
    "there is little improvement on the sensitivity to @xmath5 and about a factor of two improvement on the sensitivity to @xmath12 resulting in a possible limit of @xmath137 at 95% c.l . using the laser mode .",
    "this measurement improvement on @xmath12 reflects the greater sensitivity at higher energy .",
    "confidence level curves are shown in fig .",
    "14 with some of the results summarized in table iv .    to obtain these sensitivities to anomalous couplings we made a number of assumptions on @xmath52 , the scale of new physics used in the form factors , the beamstrahlung spectrum , and the systematic error .",
    "we discuss the effects of varying these parameters starting with the systematic error which is relevant to the 500 gev and 1 tev cases . reducing the systematic error from 5% to 2%",
    "reduces the precision on @xmath5 roughly proportionately with the systematic error , i.e. a factor of two reduction in the systematic error will tighten the limits on @xmath5 by roughly a factor of two .",
    "in contrast , the attainable constraints on @xmath12 does not in general improve as much , especially for constraints obtained from the @xmath135 distributions which give the tightest of all bounds on @xmath12 .",
    "this is more pronounced for the 500 gev case than the tev case .",
    "we can see the reason for this by refering to figures 8 , 9 , 12 , and 13 .",
    "varying @xmath5 results in an overall shift in the cross section effecting all regions of phase space while in contrast , the effect of @xmath12 grows larger with increasing @xmath135 .",
    "the largest effect is at highest @xmath64 where the cross section , and hence the statistics are lowest . thus , at least for the 500 gev case , statistical errors still play a role and it indicates that at a tev they could also be important if the nlc does not achieve the large integrated luminosities we have assumed .",
    "we next consider the effect of using the beamstrahlung spectrum arising from the g=1 beam geometry . the only place this change has any effect on our results is a slight improvement on the bounds obtained using the @xmath64 distributions .",
    "this can be attributed to the effect the harder photon spectrum has on the @xmath64 distribution .    finally , we consider the effect of varying @xmath52 , the energy scale used in the form factors to preserve unitarity at high energy .",
    "we took @xmath55  tev to obtain our results .",
    "changing @xmath52 to 500 gev and to 2 tev has no effect whatsoever on our @xmath3  gev and 200  gev bounds .",
    "for the 500  gev case there is a small decrease in the sensitivity ( of the order of a few percent ) if we decrease @xmath52 to 500 gev and virtually no change when we increase it to 2 tev .",
    "this is true for all measurements except those involving the @xmath64 distribution .",
    "this is not unexpected .",
    "since the form factor was introduced to suppress anomalous couplings at high energy , if the cutoff scale is reduced it is doing what is was introduced to do . if this scale is much larger than the characteristic energy scale of the process being studied , increasing it further should have no effect .",
    "the exception of the @xmath64 distributions reflects that these particular obervables are most sensitive to deviations at high energy .",
    "we find similar effects for the @xmath119 tev collider although here the changes are more pronounced . to demonstrate the effect on the @xmath64 distribution we plot in fig .",
    "15 the @xmath64 distribution of the outgoing muon for the three values of @xmath52 with @xmath138 using the backscattered laser spectrum with @xmath119 tev .",
    "we do not consider the choice of this scale an important one .",
    "if it were small enough to make a difference in these measurements we would expect the new physics to manifest itself in other ways , otherwise , the scale would be large enough not to matter .",
    "we examined single @xmath0 production in @xmath1 collisions for a number of collider energies and sources of energetic photons . in our studies we included",
    "the @xmath0 boson decays to final state fermions and other processes which contribute to the same final state . at high energy ,",
    "the off resonance results are important since interference effects between these other diagrams and the @xmath0 production diagrams enhance the significance of anomalous couplings , particularly @xmath12 .",
    "although these effects contribute relatively little to the total cross section , their significance in constraining the anomalous couplings can be large , especially at high energies and high luminosities where these effects are statistically significant .",
    "we found that with a @xmath3 gev @xmath4 collider operating as an @xmath1 collider , @xmath5 could be measured to @xmath139 at 95% c.l . with 500  pb@xmath91 which is as good as can be expected using @xmath0 pair production at lep200 and is almost two orders of magnitude more precise than present direct measurements . on the other hand @xmath12",
    "can be constrained to @xmath140 at 95% c.l . which , although a significant improvement over present measurements , is not as sensitive as the expected lep200 sensitivity .    we considered single @xmath0 production in @xmath4 collisions at @xmath105  gev in the effective photon approximation .",
    "here we found that @xmath5 could be measured to @xmath141 and @xmath12 to @xmath142 at 95% c.l .. again , the former measurement is comparable to what can be achieved in @xmath0 pair production while the latter is not quite as precise .",
    "what makes this process interesting is that it offers a means of measuring the @xmath2 couplings independently of the @xmath7 couplings which is far from trivial in the @xmath0 pair production process . given the potential importance of this process , an explicit calculation of the reaction @xmath143 is in progress that does not resort to the weizacker - williams approximation @xcite .    for the high energy , high luminosity , nlc @xmath4 collider we considered both a backscattered laser photon spectrum and a beamstrahlung photon spectrum . for @xmath68  gev @xmath144 and @xmath145 and for @xmath119  tev , @xmath144 and @xmath146 using the backscattered laser approach .",
    "using the beamstrahlung photon spectrum is only slightly less sensitive .",
    "the measurement of @xmath5 is approaching the level of radiative corrections and might be sensitive to new physics at the loop level .",
    "on the other hand , it is expected that the sensitivity to @xmath47 would have to be at least an order of magnitude more sensitive to be interesting . from our analysis",
    "it does not appear that there is any overwhelming advantage to go to higher energies to study the trilinear gauge boson couplings using @xmath1 collisions .",
    "the bounds obtainable for @xmath5 are at least twice as precise as any obtainable from direct measurement at any other facility being considered  they are roughly twice as sensitive as those achievable at the ssc , and the bounds on @xmath12 are comparable to those obtainable at the ssc .",

    "we summarize the calkul spinor technique @xcite and give the helicity amplitudes for the process @xmath147 where @xmath148 can be @xmath149 or @xmath150 .",
    "we do not go into any detail and refer the interested reader to the literature and references therein .",
    "we limit our discussion to massless fermions and massless external gauge bosons , which apply to our problem .",
    "the propagators for the fermions and gauge bosons have the same form as in the usual trace technique so we will not discuss them here .    the spinor technique results in reducing strings of spinors and gamma matrices to sandwiches of spinors which can be evaluated easily .",
    "in doing so , one makes extensive use of the _ right _ and _ left _ projection operators defined by @xmath151 .",
    "one defines two four - vectors , @xmath152 and @xmath153 , which obey the following relations : @xmath154 and the basic spinors : @xmath155 and @xmath156 note that in the massless limit , one can use @xmath157 and @xmath158 to describe both particles and antiparticles , with the spin sum @xmath159 .",
    "these two spinors are the building blocks for any spinor of lightlike momentum p : @xmath160 two identities are essential for the reduction of the strings ; the spin sum given above and the chisholm identity : @xmath161 where @xmath162 is @xmath163 and represents the helicity state .",
    "these two identities allow one to reduce strings of spinors and gamma matrices to sandwiches of spinors .",
    "only two of the four possible sandwiches are non - zero : @xmath164 and @xmath165 once the amplitude has been reduced to a series of factors of @xmath166 and @xmath167 , the expressions can be evaluated by computer .",
    "a judicious choice of the four - vectors @xmath152 and @xmath153 simplifies the evaluation of the @xmath168 and @xmath36 terms . for our calculation",
    ", we used the definition of ref .",
    "@xmath169 @xmath170 @xmath171 to obtain @xmath172    these forms are ideally suited for programming .",
    "when dealing with several diagrams , one simply evaluates the amplitudes of each diagram as complex numbers and squares the sum of the amplitudes in order to obtain the @xmath173 .    to include massless gauge bosons one represents , as usual , the gauge boson by its polarization vector . following kleiss and sterling we use the definition : @xmath174 where @xmath175 is any lightlike four - vector not collinear to @xmath176 or @xmath177 .",
    "the choice of @xmath175 acts as a choice of gauge and provides a powerful verification of gauge invariance ; it can be shown that two different choices of @xmath175 will lead to two expressions that will differ by a term proportional to the photon momentum . when dotted into the amplitude",
    ", this extra term must vanish identically because of gauge invariance .",
    "hence , two different choices of @xmath175 must give exactly the same answer .",
    "if they do nt , there is a mistake in the amplitude .",
    "generally , we choose @xmath175 to be one of the four - vectors of the problem at hand .",
