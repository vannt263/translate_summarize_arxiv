    "the traditional form of the market in economics can be best described by the set of firms and consumers who sell and buy goods . in a market , a trade between a consumer and a firm occurs if her valuation @xmath6 exceeds the product price @xmath1 quoted by the firm .",
    "this description , however , hypothesizes that the product is known to consumers in the market , which is not always justified in real situations .",
    "for example , although a company produces a brand new product which can potentially attract millions of people , the company can sell very few if the information of this new product has not been propagated yet across the public . in a modernized society",
    "it costs a fortune only to make the public know that there is a new product , and companies are spending tremendous amounts of money in massive advertisement on , e.g. , a half - minute tv commercial or a small portion of a nationwide newspaper . sponsoring olympic games or world cup football championship costs much more .    from the above reasoning",
    ", it is natural that some companies seek other ways to make the product information available without spending the advertisement cost .",
    "one of the strategies along this direction is to motivate a buyer to recommend the product to her social surroundings .",
    "an obvious way for this is to pay the consumer if the referral induces the actual purchase of the product by her social acquaintances .",
    "this is how network marketing works .    in this paper",
    ", we introduce a way of constructing a small - world tree network   analogous to the watts - strogatz network model  @xcite and use a game theoretic numerical approach to simulate network marketing in which the product is sold only through the connections in an existing social network . in parallel to the geometric small - world transition that the average distance from the manufacturer ceases to increase linearly with the network size , it is observed that manufacturer s profit exhibits striking difference between the one - dimensional regular chain network and the small - world tree network .",
    "we also investigate the consumer surplus in network marketing , in comparison with conventional marketing .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : network ] , the construction method of small - world tree networks is introduced .",
    "the game of consumer referrals is reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : game ] , and extended to the case of general tree networks .",
    "section  [ sec : results ] is devoted to the main result for manufacturer s profit and also includes a discussion of the consumer surplus .",
    "finally , a brief summary is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "social connections of people in societies have been studied in the framework of complex network  @xcite . in most social networks , it is now well - known that they share characteristics in common such as the small - world behavior , a high level of clustering , and so on .",
    "we here construct a directed small - world network in the same spirit as the watts - strogatz model  @xcite and then play the game of consumer referrals  @xcite on top of the network .",
    "to make the situation simple , we assign each consumer a unique value of the rank which is the distance ( number of edges ) from the company , and assume that each consumer has only one precedent consumer except the first consumer .",
    "a consumer at rank @xmath7 can refer all consumers at rank @xmath8 directly connected to her . however , the reverse referral is forbidden ( the product information flows only in the downward direction from the company ) and accordingly , each consumer gets the referral only from one unique precedent consumer . in the graph theory , the above structure is better captured by the directed tree graph .  .",
    "]    figure  [ fig : network ] shows schematically the construction method of the network used in this work .",
    "we first build a one - dimensional ( 1d ) directed chain in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](a ) , where we have five consumers ( circles ) labelled as @xmath9 and the company ( square ) .",
    "the rank @xmath7 of the consumer @xmath10 in the initial 1d chain is thus given by @xmath11 .",
    "starting from the consumer @xmath12 [ marked by a filled circle in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](a ) ] , we decide whether or not to rewire the edge @xmath13 with probability @xmath0 . if rewiring is decided [ marked by the crossed edge in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](a ) ] , all consumers and their connections below @xmath12 are attached to a randomly selected vertex in the set @xmath14 .",
    "for example , in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](a ) , @xmath15 and there is only one vertex ( @xmath16 ) with @xmath17 , resulting in the network structure in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](b ) .",
    "the process goes on to @xmath18 in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](b ) , which shows the situation as an example that the edge is not selected to be rewired . in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](c ) for @xmath19 , the edge @xmath20 can be rewired to either @xmath16 or @xmath21 . in the case",
    "that there are more than one vertex to which the edge can be rewired , one is randomly picked : shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : network](d ) is the situation that @xmath21 is selected .",
    "the whole process continues subsequently from @xmath12 to @xmath22 .    when the rewiring probability @xmath23 , the network reduces simply to a one - dimensional regular chain network , while in the opposite case of @xmath24 , the network becomes a star - like network in which vertices @xmath25 are all connected to @xmath16 .",
    "similarly to the original watts - strogatz network  @xcite , one can change the network structure by varying the rewiring probability @xmath0 .    in most studies of complex networks ,",
    "the characteristic path length defined as the average geodesic length connecting each pair of vertices has been widely used to characterize the structural property of the network . in particular ,",
    "many networks have been shown to exhibit the so - called small - world behavior that the characteristic path length increases with the network size @xmath4 very slowly ( often in the logarithmic way ) . in the present study",
    "we define the average rank @xmath26 according to @xmath27 which is simply the number of edges from the manufacturer , analogous to the characteristic path length in the network literature .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : rank ] , @xmath26 is displayed as a function of @xmath0 for various sizes @xmath28 , 200 , 400 , and 800 .",
    "as @xmath0 is increased from zero , @xmath26 reduces monotonically , becoming almost independent of @xmath4 for sufficiently large values of @xmath0 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : rank ] shows @xmath26 as a function of @xmath4 for @xmath23 , 0.01 , 0.02 , and 0.10 .",
    "it is clearly observed that the cases @xmath23 and @xmath5 exhibit quite different behavior : when @xmath23 , @xmath29 , while for @xmath5 , @xmath26 increases very slowly with @xmath4 .",
    "consequently , the network of consumer referrals constructed in the present work shows the small - world behavior at @xmath5 , similarly to the original watts - strogatz network  @xcite .",
    "in this section , the game of consumer referrals is played on the network constructed in sec .  [",
    "sec : network ] .",
    "the manufacturer produces the product at the marginal cost @xmath30 and sells it at the price @xmath1 to consumers . to make sense ,",
    "@xmath1 should be larger than @xmath30 for the company tries to make a positive profit .",
    "we assume that a consumer s valuation @xmath6 for the product constitutes quenched random variables following given distribution function @xmath31 . for simplicity",
    ", we use the uniform probability distribution function : @xmath32 for @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 otherwise .",
    "the standard market works in a very simple way : the @xmath10th consumer has valuation @xmath35 and decides whether or not to buy according to the condition @xmath36 if the inequality is satisfied , the product is bought by the consumer since she thinks that the product is worth her spending .",
    "accordingly , the probability of the purchase per consumer is simply @xmath37 ( for the uniform distribution of the valuation ) , yielding the total profit of the manufacturer @xmath38 @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the advertisement cost .",
    "the optimal price @xmath41 yields the maximum profit @xmath42    in the case of network marketing , the situation becomes more complicated since each player can also make a profit if her referral induces actual purchase . in our model",
    ", we include both the referral cost @xmath43 which is the cost to make one referral , and the referral fee @xmath2 which is the initiative money the company pays in return for a successful referral .",
    "each consumer pays @xmath43 irrespective of the success of her referral ( e.g. , the consumer has to make phone calls to persuade her social surroundings to buy the product ) while @xmath2 is paid to her on the condition of a successful referral . as a simple example , consider the 1d regular network of two consumers 1 and 2 .",
    "the second consumer has none to refer and thus her decision making is quite simple : she buys the product if @xmath44 . on the other hand , the first consumer buys if @xmath45 where @xmath37 is the probability that the second consumer buys the product . when this happens the first consumer earns the money @xmath2 .",
    "regardless of the success of her referral she should spend the cost @xmath43 . if there is no worth making referrals , i.e. , when @xmath46 is less than zero , she simply does not make any referral but she still buys if @xmath47 .",
    "if there are @xmath4 consumers in the 1d regular chain network , the purchase condition ( [ eq : v1 ] ) for consumer @xmath10 reads @xmath48 with the minimum valuation @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the probability that the @xmath51th consumer buys the product .",
    "generalization of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1dvi ] ) to the network structure in sec .",
    "[ sec : network ] is straightforward : @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the set of neighboring consumers of @xmath10 in the downward direction from the manufacturer . for the consumers at the bottom ranks",
    "the minimum valuation is given by @xmath54 .",
    "the consumer referral game in the present study goes as follows : ( i ) the network of size @xmath4 with the rewiring probability @xmath0 is built .",
    "( ii ) the valuation @xmath35 of each consumer is assigned from the uniform distribution in @xmath55 $ ] .",
    "( iii ) starting from the consumers at the end of the network whose ranks take the largest value , we compute the minimum valuations as described above [ @xmath54 for bottom consumers and eq .",
    "( [ eq : networkvi ] ) for others ] .",
    "( iv ) after the minimum valuation is computed for every consumer , we consider consumer @xmath10 at rank @xmath56 , starting from @xmath16 , and check the condition @xmath57 .",
    "if the inequality is fulfilled , the product is bought by @xmath10 , and we proceed to the consumers at rank @xmath58 . if the inequality is not satisfied and consumer @xmath10 does not buy the product , the chain of buyer s referral on the branch terminates .",
    "( v ) the game ends when all chains of buy - and - refer stop .",
    "when the game ends , we compute the profit of the manufacturer @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the number of consumers who bought the product .",
    "we fix @xmath30 and @xmath43 as constants and obtain the profit @xmath38 as a function of @xmath1 and @xmath2 . from the point of view of the manufacturer , we aim to optimize the profit with respect to both @xmath1 and @xmath2 .    in our game of consumer referrals ,",
    "we assume that only the consumers who actually bought the product make referrals .",
    "we believe that this assumption is reasonable in view of that few people are willing to buy the product if the referrer herself has not bought it .",
    "numerical simulations are performed at fixed values of the marginal production cost @xmath61 and the referral cost @xmath62 ( the use of other values , if not too different , is not expected to change the main results ) . in the two - dimensional parameter space @xmath63 \\times [ 0,1]$ ]",
    ", we first divide each parameter range into ten intervals of the width @xmath64 and then compute the profit of manufacturer @xmath65 at the centers of 100 square boxes in the 2d parameter space . for the box where @xmath38 has the largest value , we repeat the above procedure four times with subsequently narrower intervals ( @xmath66 and @xmath67 ) . when @xmath65 is computed for given values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , we make an average over 10,000 different realizations of the network structure and valuation .",
    "figure  [ fig : profit ] displays the maximum profit of the manufacturer per consumer ( @xmath68 ) as a function of the rewiring probability @xmath0 . as @xmath0",
    "is increased from zero , @xmath69 is shown to be monotonically increasing . since all curves for different network sizes overlap in a broad range of @xmath0 except the region where @xmath0 is close to either zero or unity , we henceforth focus on the system size @xmath70 .",
    "one can also conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig : profit ] that the profit is proportional to the network size in the broad intermediate region of @xmath0 as expected . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : profit ] , @xmath68 is exhibited as a function of @xmath4 at @xmath71 , 0.02 , and 0.04 .",
    "clearly shown is that the behavior at @xmath23 is strikingly different from those at @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , for @xmath23 the maximum profit @xmath69 is constant irrespective of @xmath4 while it grows linearly with @xmath4 for sufficiently large networks as soon as @xmath0 takes a nonzero value .",
    "this observation is in parallel to the small - world transition discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : network ] ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : rank ] ) , implying that the abrupt change in the behavior of @xmath69 at @xmath72 is closely related with the structural small - world transition , reflected in the behavior of @xmath26 .",
    "the behavior around @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : profit ] is also interesting : as @xmath4 grows larger , the increase of @xmath69 with @xmath0 approaching unity appears to be sharper , which indicates that in the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath73 ) @xmath69 should have discontinuity at @xmath24 .",
    "when @xmath24 , the network reduces to a star network , where all but one consumer ( @xmath74 ) are connected to the first consumer ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to compute @xmath69 as follows : the minimum valuation for the @xmath10th ( @xmath75 ) consumer simply reads @xmath76 because she has none to refer , while the first consumer has @xmath77 .",
    "the case of @xmath78 is trivial : the first consumer buys the product with probability @xmath37 but she does not make any referral . in the opposite case of @xmath79 , the minimum valuation for the",
    "first consumer becomes negative for sufficiently large values of @xmath4 and consequently she always buys the product , resulting in the total number of buyers @xmath80 .",
    "the manufacturer s profit per consumer is thus given by @xmath81 in the limit of large @xmath4 , and the optimal value of @xmath1 is obtained from @xmath82 , leading to the relation @xmath83 . since the profit is a decreasing function of @xmath2 , @xmath84",
    "is attained when @xmath84 satisfies @xmath85 and one finally gets @xmath86 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 for the values @xmath61 and @xmath62 used in this work .",
    "this approximate value of @xmath68 is in reasonably good agreement with the value at @xmath24 in fig .",
    "[ fig : profit ] , apparently supporting the existence of the discontinuity of @xmath68 at @xmath24 in the thermodynamic limit .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : pr ] , the optimal values ( a ) @xmath89 and ( b ) @xmath84 are shown as functions of the rewiring probability @xmath0 for @xmath70 .",
    "the values in figs .",
    "[ fig : profit ] and [ fig : pr ] at @xmath24 are reasonably well described by the above approximate calculations [ accurate only in the leading - order terms of @xmath90 .",
    "it is very interesting to note that the optimal value of the price @xmath89 does not change significantly with @xmath0 in a broad range of @xmath0 , while the optimal value of the referral fee @xmath84 keeps decreasing with @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , the above result suggests that in network marketing the manufacturer needs to decrease the referral fee as the network structure becomes more complex from the 1d chain network .",
    "we next compare the above results obtained from network marketing with the results for the conventional market . the maximum profit for the conventional market in eq .",
    "( [ eq : marketpimax ] ) is larger for the corresponding value for network marketing shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : profit ] when the advertisement cost @xmath40 is not so great .",
    "however , in case that @xmath40 grows large , e.g. , for realistic values of @xmath4 , the manufacturer can make more profit by changing to network marketing .",
    "for example , if the company spends 50% of its profit as the advertisement cost , the company can make more profit in network marketing with @xmath91 .",
    "the monotonically increasing behavior of the maximum profit in fig .",
    "[ fig : profit ] suggests that the manufacturer prefers the situation in which all but one consumer buy without referrals , and only one consumer makes all referrals and earns a big profit .",
    "this star - like network structure is simply equivalent to the situation when the manufacturer makes a daughter firm which takes care of all issues related with the distribution and the sale of the product .",
    "we study the consumer surplus as follows : for given network structure parameterized by @xmath0 , the manufacturer maximizes its profit as described in sec .",
    "[ subsec : companyprofit ] by using the optimal values @xmath89 and @xmath84 . at given values of @xmath89 and @xmath84 ,",
    "the surplus for the @xmath10th consumer reads @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the number of consumers ( or potential buyers ) attached to @xmath10 , @xmath94 is the number of actual buyers among @xmath93 consumers , and @xmath95 is the measure of @xmath10 s satisfaction in buying the product ( the larger @xmath95 , the happier ) . when the consumer @xmath10 does not buy the product her consumer surplus @xmath96 since she gets no referral fee from the manufacturer and does not spend any referral cost .",
    "figure  [ fig : consumerprofit ] displays the averaged consumer surplus @xmath97 .",
    "very interestingly , the consumer surplus increases first , then stays almost at the same level around @xmath98 , and finally decreases again as @xmath99 is approached .",
    "it is thus concluded that while manufacturer s profit becomes the highest at @xmath24 , this does not lead to the highest consumer surplus .    in the conventional market described by eqs .",
    "( [ eq : marketpmax ] ) and ( [ eq : marketpimax ] ) , the surplus @xmath100 is realized only when the consumer buys , i.e. , when the inequality ( [ eq : vimarket ] ) is satisfied , and accordingly the surplus per consumer is given by @xmath101 where the uniform distribution @xmath32 for @xmath33 $ ] has been used . inserting eq .",
    "( [ eq : marketpmax ] ) to eq .",
    "( [ eq : marketconsumer ] ) , one obtains @xmath102 where the same value of @xmath61 has been used as in network marketing .",
    "it is interesting to see that although conventional marketing outperforms network marketing from the viewpoint of the manufacturer s profit ( unless the advertisement cost is large ) , the consumer surplus is much larger for network marketing in a broad range of @xmath0 .",
    "we have proposed a game theoretic way to study network marketing where consumers can also play the role of selling agents motivated by the referral fee the company offers in return for successful referrals .",
    "a simple model to build directed tree networks has been introduced to investigate the effects of the network structure on the game of network marketing . as the rewiring probability @xmath0",
    "is increased from zero to unity , the network structure changes from a one - dimensional regular chain to a star network .",
    "the manufacturer s profit is then numerically maximized by using the two parameters in the game : the price of the product and the referral fee .",
    "observed is that the manufacturer s profit takes the maximum value at @xmath24 ( the star network ) as expected .",
    "we have also investigated the consumer surplus and found it higher at intermediate values of @xmath0 .",
    "although the manufacturer s profit is higher in conventional marketing than in network marketing in general , the consumer surplus has been found to be opposite , i.e. , higher in network marketing . in real situations ,",
    "the higher consumer surplus in network marketing may motivate each consumer to broaden her social acquaintances , eventually increasing the total number of potential buyers .",
    "when this happens , the manufacturer can consider changing to network marketing .",
