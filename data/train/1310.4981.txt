    "a few years ago the parma group embarked in an ambitious program : computing renormalization constants for lattice qcd to three - loop accuracy .",
    "since a non - perturbative computation of renormalization constants ( rcs ) has been the preferred choice for quite a long time , the rationale for such a program deserves a few words .",
    "the theoretical status of a perturbative computation of rcs is in principle firm : from a fundamental point of view , renormalizability is strictly speaking proved only in perturbation theory ( pt ) and quantities like fermion bilinears are either finite or only logarithmically divergent ; since there are no power divergences , pt must work . from a practical point of view difficulties",
    "show up : traditional ( diagrammatic ) lattice pt is cumbersome , so that one can get at most two - loop results ; in practice , most results are only one - loop .",
    "since lattice pt itself is badly convergent , this is a serious concern .",
    "numerical stochastic perturbation theory ( nspt @xcite ) enables high - loop computations and circumvents this problem .",
    "indeed , three- ( and even four- ) loop results were published for finite rcs in the scheme defined by wilson action and wilson fermions @xcite . + a follow - up of @xcite was announced for logarithmically divergent currents , for which a careful assessment of finite size effects is needed . in recent years a clean way to effectively control the latter was introduced in @xcite , which we put at work also here .",
    "this is the first of two papers dealing with the three - loop computation of lattice qcd rcs in the ri-mom scheme for plain wilson fermions and improved gauge actions : in the present paper we report results for the tree - level symanzik improved gauge action with @xmath0 and discuss the general framework of finite lattice spacing and finite size corrections ; in a second one we deal with iwasaki gauge action with @xmath1 and tackle the all the problems connected with summing pt series for lattice qcd rcs @xcite .",
    "updates on these computations have been presented in recent years at the lattice conferences , and in particular preliminary results were quoted in @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in both cases ( @xmath0 tree - level symanzik and @xmath1 iwasaki ) results can be compared with analogous non - perturbative computations for twisted mass fermions @xcite : since the renormalization scheme is massless , rcs are the same . in another paper",
    "we will finally fill the gap which was left in @xcite for rcs of logarithmically divergent currents for wilson fermions and wilson gauge action .",
    "+ the overall structure of this paper is as follows :    * ri-mom is the scheme we adhere to .",
    "section 2 recalls the basic definitions and points out a crucial issue for the success of our computations : the logarithmic contributions to the rcs we will compute can be got from continuum computations which are available in the literature .",
    "* from the discussion of section 2 it will be clear that a two - loop matching of continuum and lattice scheme is needed . since this is not available in the literature for the gauge action at hand ( tree - level symanzik )",
    ", we derive it in section 3 .",
    "we comment on the level of accuracy which we can attain , discuss in which sense this is enough and put forward the strategy for a better determination . *",
    "no chiral extrapolation is needed in our computations . in pt",
    "staying at zero quark mass is enforced by inserting the proper counterterms : in section 4 we present our three - loop result for the wilson fermions critical mass for the tree - level symanzik action ( with @xmath0 ) .",
    "this section also contains a few technical details on our computations ( _ _ e.g .",
    "the number of configurations which were generated ) . * the extraction of the continuum limit is attained by fitting irrelevant contributions , which should be compliant to the lattice symmetries .",
    "this should be done having in mind that ri-mom is defined in the infinite volume : there is a subtle interplay between fitting finite lattice spacing and finite volume corrections .",
    "section 5 is devoted to a general discussion of our strategy to get results in the continuum and in the infinite volume limit .",
    "* section 6 contains our results ; in particular , we briefly comment on the comparison with non - perturbative results .    as said , this paper has a follow - up in @xcite , which contains more remarks on different ways of summing the series , trying to single out the different ( relevant and irrelevant ) contributions . in @xcite",
    "we also comment to which extent the techniques we put at work in the nspt context can provide a fresher look into the lattice version of the ri-mom scheme .",
    "ri-mom is one of the most popular renormalization schemes for lattice qcd @xcite ; being regulator independent , it can be effectively adopted in a lattice regularization . while this has been highly recognized , one technical detail has been not yet fully appreciated : in a ri-mom perturbative computation of lattice rcs , logarithmic contributions can be inferred from continuum computations .",
    "this is extremely useful to us . in a traditional computation ,",
    "logarithmic contributions are the _ easy _ part , while finite terms require the really big efforts ; in nspt it is just the other way around .",
    "as it will be clear in the following , we need to fit our results to single out relevant and irrelevant contributions . while disentangling logarithmic and finite terms",
    "is in principle feasible , this would require a terrific numerical precision , _ de facto _ impossible to attain .",
    "+ to renormalize quark bilinears in ri-mom one starts from green functions constructed as expectation values computed on external quark states at fixed momentum @xmath2 @xmath3 by inserting different @xmath4 one obtains the green functions relevant for the different currents , _",
    "e.g. _ the scalar ( identity ) , pseudoscalar ( @xmath5 ) , vector ( @xmath6 ) , axial ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "since these are gauge - dependent quantities , a choice for the gauge has to be made .",
    "as it is common for the lattice implementation of ri-mom , landau gauge is our choice .",
    "this is mainly due to technical reasons , since landau gauge can be enforced in a lattice simulation by a minimization procedure . for nspt the same holds , including the additional choice of fast fourier transform acceleration ( see @xcite ) . from green functions , vertex functions",
    "are then obtained by amputation ( @xmath8 is the quark propagator ) @xmath9 the quark field renormalization constant has to be computed from the condition @xmath10 after projecting on tree - level structure o_(p ) = tr(p_o__(p ) ) , one enforces renormalization conditions that read @xmath11 in order to have a mass - independent scheme , all this is defined at zero quark mass .    in a lattice perturbative computation , we can write the generic @xmath12 in the continuum limit ( @xmath13 ) @xmath14 where the lattice cutoff ( @xmath15 ) is in place and the expansion is in the renormalized coupling . to make our notations a bit lighter ,",
    "we have omitted any reference to any operator , _",
    "i.e. _ we wrote @xmath12 and not @xmath16 as we did a few lines above . in the same spirit we have omitted any dependence on the ( covariant ) gauge parameter @xmath17 : as already pointed out , the reader has to assume the choice @xmath18 ( landau ) . making",
    "this choice explicit simplifies the formulas ; we will comment on the general formulation a few lines below , pointing out why our ( apparently naive ) notation is indeed correct for landau gauge . for finite quantities ( _ e.g. _ vector and axial currents ) @xmath19 ; for divergent quantities ( _ e.g. _ scalar and pseudoscalar currents ) divergencies show up as powers of @xmath20 . to compute the @xmath12s in nspt",
    ", we want to eventually manage expansions in the bare lattice coupling @xmath21 @xmath22    by differentiating eq .",
    "( 4 ) with respect to @xmath20 one obtains the expression for the anomalous dimension @xmath23 since this is a scheme dependent , finite quantity , one has to recover an expansion in which coefficients are finite numbers ( with no dependence on the regulator left ) @xmath24 this expansion is known to three - loop accuracy from continuum computations @xcite . imposing that the expression obtained by differentiating eq .",
    "( 4 ) matches eq .",
    "( 6 ) ( with the proper values for the @xmath25 read from @xcite ) we can obtain the expressions of all the @xmath26 .",
    "in practice the solution comes from the request that all the ( powers of the ) logarithms cancel out ; as a result , each @xmath27 is expressed in terms of the @xmath28 , the @xmath29 is known when one determines a quantity at order @xmath30 ) .",
    "notice that a similar dependence holds for the @xmath31 ; they depend on @xmath32 .",
    "as it will be clear in section 5 , once a @xmath33 has been determined , its value can enter the analysis at higher orders . ] and the coefficients of the @xmath34-function ; the latter come into place since part of the dependence on @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( 4 ) is via the coupling @xmath36 . +",
    "the @xmath31 of eq .",
    "( 5 ) can finally be obtained by re - expressing the expansion in eq .",
    "( 4 ) as an expansion in the bare coupling @xmath21 .",
    "this makes the @xmath37 depend ( also ) on the coefficients of the matching of the continuum and the lattice couplings .",
    "in particular , our three - loop expansion of the zs asks for a two - loop matching of the continuum coupling to the lattice coupling in the scheme we are working in , _",
    "i.e. _ tree - level symanzik gauge action with @xmath0 wilson fermions .",
    "since this is not known from the literature ( @xcite provides a one - loop matching ) , we derived it : this is discussed in the next section .",
    "+ we now come back to the issue of ( covariant ) gauge parameter dependence . in a generic ( covariant ) gauge ,",
    "not only the dependence on @xmath17 enters eq .",
    "( 4 ) , but also the gauge parameter anomalous dimension comes into place in linking eq .",
    "( 4 ) to eq .  ( 6 ) .",
    "we have worked out the formulas with generic @xmath17 and checked the correctness of our results with the two - loop computations of @xcite , which are obtained in feynman gauge .",
    "notice that the apparently naive recipe of neglecting the @xmath17-dependence from the very beginning ( as we did in our previous discussion ) returns correct results , _",
    "i.e. _ one obtains the same results by keeping track of all the @xmath17-dependences and by finally putting @xmath18 .",
    "this is due to the fact that the non trivial dependence on the gauge parameter anomalous dimension is itself proportional to @xmath17 .",
    "+ the expressions for the @xmath31 ( and @xmath27 ) are available upon request in the form of _ mathematica _ notebooks ; in the following we will focus on the finite @xmath38 and adhere to the standard recipe of summing the series at @xmath39 .",
    "actually we will report the results as expansions in yet another coupling , namely @xmath40 ( more on this later ) .",
    "as we have already pointed out , in order to reconstruct the whole set @xmath41 , the only piece of information which is missing in the literature is the two - loop matching of continuum to lattice coupling for the regularization at hand : we report this result in the next section .",
    "in the following we provide the matching of couplings enabling us to go from eq .",
    "( 4 ) to eq .  ( 5 ) .",
    "we will make use of the notation @xmath42 to enlighten that the lattice coupling we are referring to is the one defined by the regularization at hand , with the tree - level symanzik ( tls ) gauge action in place wilson fermions will also be ( implicitly , as for notation ) assumed . ] .",
    "the matching will be to the @xmath43 scheme , @xmath44 being the coupling in which the expansions in @xcite are expressed ( strictly speaking , it suffices that this holds at the finite order one is interested in ) .",
    "+ the general form of the matching between two schemes ( unprimed and primed ) reads @xmath45 the coefficient @xmath46 accounts for the choice of different momentum scales ; it enters the expressions for the matching coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 @xmath49 here @xmath50 and @xmath51 are coefficients of the @xmath34-function , while @xmath52 and @xmath53 are the scales associated with the two regularizations .",
    "while @xmath54 and @xmath55 are universal , @xmath52 and @xmath56 depend on the scheme ( and so they come in both primed and unprimed versions is unprimed as referring to the unprimed scheme and not because it is universal . ] ) . notice that eq .",
    "( [ c2 ] ) states that the two loop matching of @xmath57 to @xmath44 also entails the knowledge of @xmath58 , since @xmath59 is known .",
    "there is no obvious way of computing the direct matching of @xmath43 to the tls scheme making use of nspt .",
    "we will go through the strategy of first matching to an intermediate scheme . once again",
    ", we will rely on the fact that no computation of logarithms will be needed : every relevant logarithmic dependence is known .",
    "the strategy has already been used in  @xcite ( although in those works we had another goal ) .",
    "+ in the lattice regularization defined by tls gauge action and @xmath0 wilson fermions , we computed the perturbative expansions of rectangular wilson loops @xmath60 ( of extensions @xmath61 and @xmath62 ) and from those we computed logarithms of creutz ratios @xmath63 notice that in the previous formula everything is dimensionless .",
    "in particular , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are measured in lattice units ( _ i.e. _ they are integer numbers ) : at a given , fixed value of the lattice spacing @xmath15 , physical lengths associated to them are @xmath64 .",
    "the static quark potential can be defined via @xmath65 the static quark potential is the quantity which describes the interaction energy of a infinitely heavy @xmath66 pair at a distance @xmath67 , which in its full ( non - perturbative ) form is in first approximation just the sum of a string tension contribution , which is responsible for confinement , and a @xmath68 contribution , whose interpretation is different in different ir / uv regimes @xmath69 in pt the first term is just the coulomb potential and there is no string tension . in a lattice regularization , one",
    "is left in addition with a linearly divergent term , which gives the so called residual mass of the heavy quark : @xmath70 while @xmath71 is associated to a linearly divergent quantity , logarithmic divergencies are absorbed in @xmath72 ; extra ( _ corners _ ) divergences are absent because the quantity is built out of ratio of rectangular loops .",
    "( [ valphar ] ) defines the potential coupling @xmath73 we will be concerned with .",
    "notice that the perturbative computation of the ( power divergent ) residual mass is not supposed to be a reliable one . + a perturbative computation of the static quark potential in our lattice scheme reads @xmath74 where subscripts are written according to the actual loop counting .    in order to trade the description in terms of the @xmath75 for that in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 one has to disentangle constant and @xmath78 contributions : in nspt",
    "this requires a fitting procedure .",
    "the description in terms of @xmath76 and @xmath77 is the order by order version of eq .",
    "( [ valphar ] ) : we have actually computed @xmath73 as an expansion @xmath79    to be more precise , this is simply a particular case of the matching  ( [ matching ] ) : it is the matching of the continuum coupling @xmath73 to the lattice coupling @xmath57 . since the latter is defined at the scale @xmath80 while @xmath73 is defined at the scale @xmath81 , the factor @xmath46 of eq .",

    "we will have to come back to this when we discuss the nspt computation .",
    "+ as a byproduct of our computation we also obtain the residual mass @xmath71 as an expansion in @xmath57 @xmath87    once we have computed the matching between @xmath88 and @xmath57 , we need the matching of @xmath88 to @xmath44 .",
    "this can be read from the computation in  @xcite .",
    "the nspt computations were performed on a @xmath89 lattice ; we computed the wilson loops @xmath60 for all the values of @xmath61 and @xmath62 up to 16 .",
    "the quark mass was set to zero by plugging the appropriate mass counterterm , _",
    "i.e. _ the perturbative critical mass as read from @xcite ( see next section ) .",
    "results were averaged over @xmath90150 lattice configurations . ] .    from the @xmath60 we computed the @xmath86 .",
    "we could not take the @xmath91 limit , but regarded the @xmath86 as our estimate for @xmath85 .",
    "this is a first ( finite volume ) approximation in our setting . by fitting ( order - by - order ) our @xmath86 data to @xmath85 as defined by eq .",
    "( [ valphalat ] ) ( which is valid in the @xmath13 limit ) we incurred yet another source of approximation , since no attempt was made to take into account irrelevant , finite @xmath15 effects . despite the distortions expected from these lattice artifacts , we extracted from our data both the residual quark mass @xmath76 and the expected @xmath77 ( _ i.e. _ we fitted the parameters entering their expressions ) .",
    "since most of the parameters are known , we can estimate _ a posteriori _ how good ( or bad ) the procedure is .    in order to at least minimize the irrelevant effects we considered intervals of @xmath61 such that    * @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) ; *",
    "@xmath61 itself is not too small ( @xmath94 ) ; * the fitting intervals themselves are from 3 up to 7 points long .    on top of the systematic ( lattice artifacts )",
    "errors , results are of course also affected by statistical errors .",
    "the relative weight of these effects is different for different orders .",
    "this actually opens the way to a possible ( careful ) tradeoff between the errors .",
    "we adopted the following strategy : when systematic effects are clearly distinguishable ( i.e. statistical effects are relatively small ) , we only considered @xmath95 data ( this is the case of the tree - level potential ) . when statistical errors are significant on their own , the systematic ( finite @xmath62 ) effect is not that clear .",
    "in this case we decided to neglect this systematic effect and tame the statistical noise by averaging over different values of @xmath62 ( from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ) . in this way we obtained smoother curves .",
    "further details can be found in @xcite .    in order to verify the reliability of our approach we first checked known results .",
    "notice that despite the coupling parameters are known , even lower order results are not trivial , since at any order residual mass is unknown ( we got it as a byproduct ) . in figure  1",
    "we show our estimates for tree - level , one - loop and two - loop potential .",
    "we estimated @xmath98 as the best fitting interval for tree - level and one loop ; the same interval was also taken for two - loop computation .",
    "tree - level data were fitted to the functional form @xmath99 obtaining @xmath100 , while @xmath101 is reconstructed to a few percent .",
    "this gives a first rough idea of the impact of systematic effects .",
    "+    [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]      +    the simplest ( and straightforward ) recipe is to sum the series in the coupling @xmath102 . at @xmath103",
    "this results in @xmath104 , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , @xmath107 .",
    "here we adhere to a standar recipe for pinning down an ( order of magnitude for the ) error : it is the three - loop contribution itself . at this stage",
    "one can inspect not too big discrepancies with the values reported in @xcite for the finite renormalization constants ( actually @xmath108 is _ de facto _ fully consistent ) .",
    "larger deviations are inspected for @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "it has become very popular @xcite to sum lpt results making use of different couplings , a procedure that is often generically referred to as _ boosted perturbation theory _ ( bpt ) . as our group also observed in @xcite",
    ", there is a large fraction of arbitrariness in one - loop bpt .",
    "having three - loop results available provides a by far more stringent control .",
    "we will devote much more space to this in @xcite .",
    "here we merely quote that the use of different couplings ( much the same was done in @xcite ) makes @xmath111 and @xmath108 fully consistent with the non - perturbative results of @xcite , while for @xmath109 and @xmath110 the agreement improves , but it is not full .",
    "we notice that these are the cases for which in our case it was crucial to look for finite size effects corrections .",
    "the main message of this paper is that computing three - loop renormalization constants for lattice qcd is fully viable , both for finite and for logarithmically divergent quantities .",
    "the control on both finite lattice spacing and finite volume effects appears solid and reliable .    while three - loop finite renormalization constants are fully consistent with non - perturbative results , the logarithmically divergent @xmath109 and @xmath110 are not .",
    "one should keep in mind that a typical ri-mom lattice computation is performed over a range of momenta eventually pinching the ir region .",
    "now , contributions at low momenta are from one side supposed to be relevant in assessing irrelevant ( uv ) contributions ( higher powers of @xmath112 are suppressed ) , from another side prone to suffer from finite size ( ir ) effects .",
    "all in all , there is a subtle interplay of uv and ir effects .",
    "we proposed a computational scheme to take control over this interplay in our perturbative framework . in @xcite ,",
    "which is dedicated to three - loop computations in a different gluonic regularization ( iwasaki action ) , we devote more attention to quantify the impact of irrelevant and finite volume contributions , comparing results for the two different gluonic action ( tls and iwasaki ) .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that the numerics of ir effects that we compute in lpt are not supposed to be the same of non - perturbative computations , while there is quite a consensus that this is the case for irrelevant ( uv ) ones . in @xcite",
