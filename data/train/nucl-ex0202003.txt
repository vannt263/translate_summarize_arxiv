    "central heavy ion collisions at relativistic incident energies represent an ideal tool to study nuclear matter at high temperatures .",
    "particle production is  at all incident energies  a key quantity to extract information on the properties of nuclear matter under these extreme conditions .",
    "particles carrying strangeness have turned out to be very valuable messengers .",
    "a specific purpose of this paper is the presentation of the evolution of strange particle production over a large range of incident energies .",
    "many results are shown together with a theoretical interpretation .",
    "the attempts to describe particle production yields with statistical models  [ 1 - 8 ] have turned out to be very successful over this large domain of incident energies .",
    "at incident energies around 1 @xmath5gev pion and kaon production is very different : pions can be produced by direct @xmath8 collisions in contrast to kaons . the threshold for @xmath0 production in @xmath8 collisions is 1.58 gev and only collective effects can accumulate the energy needed to produce a @xmath0 together with a @xmath9 due to strangeness conservation .",
    "the threshold for @xmath1 production is even higher ( 2.5 gev ) as they are produced as @xmath0 @xmath1 pairs .",
    "these conditions lead to very different yields for the various mesons as demonstrated in fig .",
    "[ spectra_au ] showing some spectra from central au+au collisions at 1.5 @xmath5gev .",
    "the yields of pions are much higher than for kaons ; positively and negatively charged pions differ due to the @xmath10 ratio of au .",
    "the yield of @xmath0 is by nearly two orders of magnitude higher than the one of @xmath1 due to the different thresholds . at higher incident energies all these differences diminish as will be discussed .",
    "pion spectra of excellent quality are now available or will appear soon  [ 9 - 10 ] .",
    "figure  [ pion_p ] shows as an example spectra of positively charged pions as @xmath11 ( boltzmann representation ) for c+c and au+au collisions at different incident energies .",
    "the spectra are measured close to mid rapidity .    all spectra exhibitconcave shapes in this representation deviating from a boltzmann distribution which would be a straight line .",
    "yet , even in a thermal condition one is not expecting a pure boltzmann distribution as pions originate both from `` free '' pions and from resonance decay after freeze out .",
    "this type of shape is observed up to the highest incident energies and the above interpretation holds qualitatively . for a quantitative description with these two components",
    "still some work has to be done .",
    "spectra of @xmath0 and @xmath1 from mass - symmetric systems c+c and au+au at incident energies from 0.6 to 2.0 @xmath5gev measured at midrapidity are shown in fig .",
    "[ kp_km ] .",
    "they exhibit boltzmann shapes in all cases  @xcite .",
    "their inverse slope parameters increase monotoneously with incident energy and the heavier system exhibits harder spectra than the light system at the same incident energy .",
    "the interaction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 with nuclear matter is very different : due to their @xmath12 content @xmath0 can not be absorbed , while @xmath1 can easily be absorbed on a nucleon converting it into a @xmath9 .",
    "this difference makes the @xmath0 to be messengers of the early stage of the collision",
    ". therefore @xmath0 are ideal probes for this dense stage and allow to extract the stiffness of the nuclear equation of state  @xcite .",
    "the basis of these studies is the ratio of @xmath0 measured in au+au and in c+c collisions as shown in fig .",
    "this subject is presented in detail in the talk by c.  sturm .",
    "figure  [ kp_km ] demonstrates that the yield of @xmath0 is much higher than the one of @xmath1 as mentioned already .",
    "this is caused by the different production thresholds for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . at ags energies",
    "the ratio of @xmath3 has decreased to about 5 @xcite and is as low as 1.16 at rhic  @xcite .",
    "this trend is summarized in fig .",
    "[ kp_kmm_ratio ] .",
    "the dashed line represents the results of calculations using a statistical model  @xcite .",
    "pions and @xmath0 exhibit a further very pronounced contrast : while the pion multiplicity per number of participating nucleons @xmath13 remains constant with @xmath13 , the @xmath0 multiplicity per @xmath13 rises strongly ( fig .  [ apart ] ) .",
    "the latter observation seems to be in conflict with a thermal interpretation , which  in a naive view  should give multiplicities per mass number @xmath14 being constant .",
    "[ h ]    usually , the particle number densities or the multiplicities per @xmath13 , here for pions , are described in a simplified way by a boltzmann factor @xmath15with the temperature @xmath6 and the total energy @xmath16 .",
    "the production of strange particles has to fulfil strangeness conservation .",
    "the attempt to describe the measured particle ratios including strange hadrons at ags and sps using a strangeness chemical potential @xmath17 is quite successful  @xcite .",
    "however , this grand - canonical treatement is not sufficient if the number of produced strange particles is small .",
    "then a statistical model has to take care of _ local strangeness conservation _ in each reaction as introduced in  @xcite .",
    "this is done by taking into account that e.g.  together with each @xmath0 a @xmath9 or another strange particle is produced : @xmath18,\\]]where @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath7 the baryo - chemical potential , @xmath19 the degeneracy factors , @xmath20 the production volume for making the associate pair ( see  @xcite ) and @xmath21 the total energies .",
    "we note that this volume is not identical to the volume of the system at freeze out .",
    "the volume parameter @xmath20 is taken as @xmath22 with a common @xmath23 = 1.07 fm for all systems and all incident energies .",
    "this formula , simplified for demonstration purposes , neglects other combinations leading to the production of @xmath0 as well as the use of bose - fermi distributions , which are all included in the computation .",
    "the corresponding formula for @xmath1 production @xmath24.\\]]is similar , but does not depend on @xmath7 .",
    "this point will become important later on .",
    "these formulae lead to a reduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 yields as compared to the numbers calculated without exact strangeness conservation  @xcite .",
    "two extreme conditions can be seen from these equations . in the limit of a small number of strange particles the additional term ( due to the parameter @xmath20 ) leads to a linear rise of @xmath25 , while @xmath26 remains constant .",
    "this is in very good agreement with the experimental observations shown in fig .  [ apart ] . for very high temperatures or very large volumina , the terms in brackets approach unity ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) resulting in the grand - canonical formulation .",
    "this is much better seen in the exact formulae using modified bessel functions  @xcite .    at low incident energies , the particle ratios ( except @xmath27 )",
    "are well described using this canonical approach  @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , even the measured @xmath3 ratio is described and this ratio does not depend on the choice of the volume term @xmath20 .",
    "it should be noted that the statistical model uses nominal masses of the particles while some transport calculations @xcite have to reduce the @xmath1 mass ( as expected for kaon in the nuclear medium ) in order to describe the measured yields .    before comparing the data with the calculations in detail , a summary of the measurements by the kaos collaboration is given .",
    "these results have attracted considerable interest as in heavy ion collisions the @xmath1 yield compared to the @xmath0 cross section is much higher than expected from @xmath8 collisions @xcite .",
    "this is especially evident if the kaon multiplicities are plotted as a function of @xmath2 where @xmath28 is the energy needed to produce the respective particle in @xmath8 collisions taking into account the mass of the associately produced partner . to produce a @xmath0 in @xmath8 collisions @xmath28 = 2.548 gev and a @xmath1 @xmath28 = 2.87 gev .",
    "the obvious contrast between @xmath8 and @xmath29 collisions , shown in fig .",
    "[ kp_km_sthr ] , has lead to the interpretation of the results by in - medium properties which cause e.g.  a lower threshold for @xmath1 production when produced in dense matter  @xcite .",
    "the observed difference between @xmath8 and @xmath29 collisions alone is not sufficient to conclude on properties of kaons in matter . in heavy ion collisions ,",
    "kaons can be produced by other channels , e.g.  @xmath30 which are not available in @xmath8 collisions . only by using detailed transport - model calculations one might conclude on new properties of kaons in matter  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of interest to see how the results of the statistical model appear in a representation where the @xmath0 and @xmath1 multiplicities are given as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "figure  [ kp_km_sthr_therm ] demonstrates that at values of @xmath2 less than zero the excitation functions for @xmath0 and @xmath1 cross leading to the observed equality of @xmath0 and @xmath1 at sis energies .",
    "the yields differ at ags energies by a factor of five .",
    "the difference in the rise of the two excitation functions can be understood by the formulae given above .",
    "the one for @xmath0 production contains ( @xmath31 ) while the other has @xmath32 in the exponent of the second term .",
    "as these two values are different , the excitation functions , i.e.  the variation with @xmath6 , exhibit a different rise .",
    "furthermore , the two formulae predict that the @xmath3 ratio for a given collision should not vary with centrality as @xmath20 cancels in the ratio . this has indeed been observed in au+au / pb+pb collisions between 1.5 @xmath5gev and rhic energies  @xcite as shown in fig .",
    "[ kpkm_sis_rhic ] .",
    "this independence of centrality is most astonishing as one expects at low incident energies an influence of the different thresholds and the density variation with centrality .",
    "for instance at 1.93 @xmath5gev the @xmath0 production is above and the @xmath1 production below their respective @xmath8 thresholds .",
    "transport - model calculations show clearly that strangeness equilibration requires a time interval of 40  80 fm/@xmath33  @xcite . on the other hand statistical models assuming chemical equilibration are quite successful in describing the particle yields including strange particles .    in the case of @xmath0 production",
    ", no strong absorptive channel seems to be available which could lead to chemical equlibration . for @xmath1 production",
    "the situation is quite different . at low incident energies",
    "strange quarks are found only in a few hadrons .",
    "the @xmath12 quark is essentially only in @xmath0 , while the @xmath34 quark will be shared between @xmath1 and @xmath9 ( or other hyperons ) .",
    "this sharing of the @xmath34 quark might be in chemical equlibrium as the reactions @xmath35 are strong and have only slightly negative q - values of -176 mev .",
    "the idea that the @xmath1 yield is dominated by strangeness exchange via the @xmath36 channel has been suggested by  @xcite and has been demonstrated quantitavely in a recent theoretical study  @xcite .",
    "the direct @xmath37 pair production via baryon - baryon collisions has negligible influence as these @xmath1 are absorbed entirely . in these transport - model calculations",
    "the strangeness exchange is approaching equilibrium but does not fully reach it  @xcite .",
    "for details see the talk given by c.  hartnack .",
    "if these reactions are the dominating channels , they might reach chemical equilibration , e.g.  the rates for producing @xmath1 and for absorbing @xmath1 are equal .",

    "has been reported from preliminary results of the na49 collaboration at 158 @xmath5gev  @xcite .",
    "this decrease is , however , not reproduced by the statistical model without further modifications , e.g.  by introducing an additional parameter @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "this point might be clearer when data at other beam energies will become available .",
    "strange particle production in heavy ion collisions over a rather broad range of incident energies can be described by a statistical model .",
    "the production of strange particles close to threshold requires a canonical formulation , i.e.  local strangeness conservation .",
    "this approach is able to explain many features of @xmath0 and @xmath1 production at sis energies .    while for @xmath0 production it remains open whether and how chemical equlibrium can be reached , the situation is quite different for @xmath1 .",
    "it is shown that the strangeness exchange process @xmath58 is the dominant channel for @xmath1 production at sis and likely also at ags energies .",
    "this is demonstrated by applying the corresponding law of mass action .",
    "theoretical studies confirm this interpretation .    using the energy dependence of the parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 we have shown that the statistical - model description of relativistic heavy ion collisions predicts that the yields of strange to non - strange particles reaches a well defined maximum near 30 gev lab energy .",
    "it is demonstrated that this maximum is due to the specific shape of the freeze - out curve in the @xmath50 plane .",
    "in particular a very steep decrease of the baryon chemical potential with increasing energy causes a corresponding decline of relative strangeness content in systems created in heavy ion collisions above lab energies of 30 gev .",
    "the saturation in @xmath6 , necessary for this result , might be connected to the fact that hadronic temperatures can not exceed the critical temperature @xmath59 170 mev for the phase transition to the qgp as found in solutions of qcd on the lattice .    in spite of the apparent success of the statistical models it should not appear the impression that these models describe everything .",
    "they describe yields , particle ratios .",
    "looking at spectral shapes already the expansion dynamics shows up .",

    "<S> it is demonstrated that the @xmath1 production at sis energies occurs predominantly via strangeness exchange and that this channel is approaching chemical equilibrium . </S>",
    "<S> the observed maximum in the @xmath4 excitation function is also seen in the ratio of strange to non - strange particle production . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of this maximum around 30 @xmath5gev is due to the energy dependence of the chemical freeze - out parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . </S>"
