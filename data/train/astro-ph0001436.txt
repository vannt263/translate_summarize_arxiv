    "gamma - ray bursts ( grb ) were discovered in 1969 ( klebesadel 1973 ) by the vela satellites , deployed by usa to verify the compliance of ussr to the nuclear test ban treaty . in the following 28 years thousands of events",
    "have been observed by several satellites , leading to a good characterization of the global properties of this phenomenon .",
    "a big step in this area was achieved with batse ( fishman 1994 ) the isotropical distribution of the events in the sky ( fishman & meegan 1995 ) was suggestive of an extragalactic origin , but a direct measurement of the distance in a single object was not available .",
    "what was lacking was a _",
    "fast and precise _ position , where the _ holy grail _ of grb scientists , i.e. the _ counterpart _ , could have been searched for at all wavelenghts with more chances to catch it .",
    "this was achieved in 1996 , with observations of grb by bepposax .",
    "before bepposax ( piro 1995 , boella 1999 ) grb astronomy has proceeded on a statistical approach and the only information gathered was limited to the tens of seconds of the grb : the subsequent evolution was completely unknown .",
    "the operations for a prompt follow up of grbs became operative on december 1996 , after an off - line analysis of a grb ( grb960720 : piro 1998a ) had demonstrated the designed capability of the mission .",
    "the first opportunity was on january 11 , 1997 : grb970111 .",
    "the field was pointed with the nfi 16 hours after the grb .",
    "the possible association of one of the faint sources found in the error box with the grb was under scrutiny ( feroci 1998 ) , when on february 28 , 1997 , another event , grb970228 , was detected by bepposax grbm and wfc . the nfi were pointed to the grb location 8 hours after burst .",
    "a previously unknown x - ray source was detected in the field of view of the lecs and mecs instruments with a flux in the 2 - 10 kev energy range of @xmath1 .",
    "the new source appeared to be fading away during the observation . on march 3",
    "we performed another observation that confirmed that the source was quickly decaying : at that time its flux was a factor of about 20 lower than the first observation ( figure 1 ) .",
    "this was the first detection of an `` afterglow '' of a grb ( costa 1997 ) .",
    "the flux of the source appeared to decrease following a power law dependence on time ( @xmath2 ) with index @xmath3 .",
    "further x - ray observation with the x - ray satellites asca and rosat detected the source about one week later with a flux consistent with the same law ( yoshida 1997 , frontera 1998a ) .",
    "this kind of temporal behaviour agrees with the general predictions of the fireball models for grbs ( e.g.mszros p. & rees 1997 , vietri 2000 ) . a backward extrapolation of this power law decay ( fig .",
    "2 ) is consistent with the x - ray flux measured during the burst , suggesting that the afterglow started soon after the grb .",
    "another important result came from the spectral analysis of the x - ray afterglow .",
    "it excluded a black body emission , therefore arguing against a model in which the radiation comes from the cooling of the surface of a neutron star ( frontera 1998b ) .",
    "while the x - ray monitoring of grb970228 was going on , an observational campaign of the same object was simultaneously started with the most important optical telescopes .",
    "this campaign led to the discovery ( van paradijs 1997 ) of an optical transient associated with the x - ray afterglow .",
    "as in the x - ray domain , the optical flux of the source showed a decrease well described by a power law with index -1.12 ( e.g. garcia 1998 ) , again in agreement with the general predictions of the fireball model .",
    "the images taken with the hubble space telescope ( hst ) ( fruchter 1997 , sahu 1997 ) showed the presence of a nebulosity around the optical transient .",
    "however the nebulosity was very weak , and it was not possible to disentangle whether it was associated with the host galaxy ( extragalactic origin ) or with a transient diffuse emission representing the residual of the explosion ( galactic origin )",
    ".      on 8 may 1997 the second breakthrough arrived with grb970508 ( piro 1998b ) , detected just few minutes before the satellite was passing over the ground station in malindi . this opportunity and",
    "the experience gained from previous events allowed to point the bepposax nfi on source 5.7 hours after the burst , while optical observations started 4 hours after the burst .",
    "the early detection of the optical transient ( bond 1997 ) , and its relatively bright magnitude allowed a spectroscopical measurement of its optical spectrum with the keck telescope ( metzger 1997 ) .",
    "the spectrum revealed the presence of feii and mgii absorption lines at a redshift of @xmath4 , attributed to the presence of a galaxy between us and the grb , and therefore demonstrated that grb970508 was at a cosmological distance .",
    "the bepposax observation of gb970508 has also changed our view of the grb _ phenomenon_. the old concept of a brief - sudden release of luminosity concentrated in few seconds does not stand the new information provided by bepposax . indeed",
    "the name _ afterglow _ attributed to the x - ray emission observed after the event is somewhat misleading .",
    "this is clear when one considers the energy produced in the afterglow phase , which turns out to be comparable to that of the grb . in order to compute the energy emitted in the afterglow phase it is necessary to integrate in time its luminosity and it is then crucial to know _ when _ the afterglow starts .",
    "a detailed analysis of the data of the wfc of gb970508 ( piro 1998b ) shows that the x - ray emission is present ( fig .",
    "4 ) even when the signal of the light curve disappears in to the noise at @xmath5 s ( fig.3 ) and remains visible for at least 2000 seconds , when the flux goes below the sensitivity of the wfc ( fig .",
    "the conclusion is then that the afterglow phase starts immediately after ( or even before ) than the prompt emission settles down .",
    "the energy emitted in the afterglow in x - rays turns out to be a substantial fraction ( @xmath6 ) of the energy produced by the grb .",
    "furthermore the light curve in fig .",
    "5 shows a rebursting event starting 1 day after the initial burst , an evidence that indicates that the source of the energy can re - ignite on long time scales ( piro 1998b ) .",
    "the grb observed by bepposax on december 14 , 1997 if , on one hand , has consolidated the extragalactic origin of grb , on the other has underlined the problem of the energy budget and , ultimately , of the nature of the `` central engine '' .",
    "the chain of steps leading to the identification of the counterpart of grb971214 ( dal fiume 1999 ) and its distance was the same of previous bepposax observations . with a redshift z=3.42 ( kulkarni 1998a ) this grb and its host galaxy are at a distance that corresponds to a look - back time of about 85% of the present age of the universe .",
    "at this distance , the luminosity would be about @xmath7 , were the emission isotropic .",
    "this was the highest luminosity ever observed from any celestial source .",
    "initially the huge luminosity appeared to be not compatible with the energy available in the coalescence of neutron - star mergers ( kulkarni 1998a ) , unless beaming were invoked .",
    "other alternative energetic models are based on the death of extremely massive stars , leading to an explosion orders of magnitude more energetic than a supernova , hence named _",
    "hypernova _ ( paczynski 1998 , woosley 1993 )",
    ". however it was shown ( mszros & rees 1998a ) that all these progenitors , whether neutron star - neutron star mergers or hypernovae , eventually go through the formation of a same black hole / torus system , from which the energy is extracted to form the grb .",
    "the radiation physics and energy of all mergers and hypernovae are then , to order of magnitude the same , and still compatible with the luminosity observed in grb971214 .",
    "the energy problem became much more severe with grb990123 , again one of the bepposax grb ( heise 1999 , piro 1999a ) .",
    "it was one of the brightest grb ever observed , ranking in the 0.3% top of the batse flux distribution .",
    "its distance ( z=1.6 , kulkarni 1999 ) would imply a total energy of @xmath8 , assuming isotropical emission .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath9 , at the limit of all models of mergers ( mszros & rees 1998a ) .",
    "this piece of evidence is lending support to the idea that , at least in some case , the emission is collimated .",
    "this would reduce the energy budget by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the angle of the jet .",
    "a typical feature of a jet expansion ( vs spherical ) would be the presence of an achromatic ( i.e. energy - independent ) break in the light curve , that appears when the relativistic beaming angle @xmath12 becomes @xmath13 ( e.g. rhoads 1997 , sari 1999 ) .",
    "the presence of such a break has been claimed in grb990123 ( kulkarni 1999 ) and in another more recent grb , grb990510 ( harrison 1999 ) . with an angle @xmath14",
    ", the total energy would be reduced by @xmath15 , within the limits of current models .",
    "so far evidence of an achromatic break is limited to the optical range and an independent measurement confirming its presence in different regions of the spectrum is lacking or not conclusive ( e.g. in x - rays kuulkers 1999 ) .",
    "very important indications on the geometry of the expansion can be derived by comparing the prediction of the standard scenario ( i.e. fireball expansion with synchrotron emission ) on the spectral and temporal behaviour of the afterglow with observations . in particular",
    ", the spectral and temporal slopes of the afterglow emission @xmath16 are linked together by a relationship that depends on the geometry of the fireball expansion ( sari 1997 , 1999 ) . in the assumption of an",
    "adiabatic spherical expansion in a constant density medium we have @xmath17 and @xmath18 below and above the cooling frequency @xmath19 respectively . in the case of a jet expansion",
    "the relations are @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) and @xmath22 ( ( @xmath23 ) .",
    "these relationship are plotted in fig.6 along with the measured slopes we have derived for a first sample of x - ray afterglows .",
    "the data refer to a sample of 11 afterglows , among the brightest pointed by bepposax upto may 1999 , observed from few hours to about 2 days after the grb ( stratta 1999 , piro 2000 ) .",
    "the average property of the sample are fully consistent with a spherical expansion and deviates substantially from a jet expansion _ in the first two days_. we stress that our sample is not biased against steep spectral slopes ( @xmath24 ) , because @xmath25 of the grb detected by bepposax and followed on with a fast observation , do show an x - ray afterglow .",
    "the disagreement with the jet prediction does not imply that the geometry is spherical , because deviations from the emission pattern of a spherical expansion are expected only when the beaming angle of the relativistic emission @xmath26 becomes comparable to the opening angle of the jet @xmath27 .",
    "this happens at a time @xmath28 , which should then be @xmath29 .",
    "we then derive @xmath30 .",
    "hence collimation , if present , can not be very high .",
    "information on the nature of the progenitor can be drawn from the grb environment . in the case of hypernova",
    "the massive star should die young ( @xmath31 years ) and therefore grb should be preferentially hosted in regions near the center of star - forming galaxies . on the contrary , ns - ns coalescence happens on much longer time scales and the kick velocity given to the system by two consecutive supernova explosions should bring a substantial fraction of these systems away from the the parent galaxy .",
    "so far the angular displacement of 5 optical counterparts indicates that grb are located within their host galaxies ( bloom 1999a ) , favoring the association with star - forming regions .",
    "we note also that those events are not located in the very center of their galaxies , that excludes an association of grb with agn activity .",
    "the other diagnostics of the progenitor is based on spectral measurements of broad and narrow features imprinted by a dusty - gas rich environment expected in the hypernova scenario ( e.g. perna & loeb 1998 , mszros & rees 1998b , bottcher 1998 ) . the absence of an optical transient in about 50% of well localized bepposax grb ( 25 as of dec .",
    "99 ) , in which instead an x - ray afterglow has been found in almost all the cases , may be explained by heavy absorption by dust in the optical range , which leaves almost unaffected the x - rays ( owens 1998 ) .    an exciting possibility is opened by the possible detection of x - ray iron line features in two different grb , one by bepposax ( grb970508 piro 1999b ; fig . 7 ) and the other by asca ( grb970828 , yoshida 1999 ) , associated with rebursting on time scales of the order of a day .",
    "it should be remarked that the presence of rebursting appears to be an uncommon feature of x - ray afterglows , whose temporal behaviour is very well described by power laws ( fig.8 ) at least until 2 - 3 days , when the x - ray flux goes below the sensitivity of current x - ray instruments .",
    "both the temporal and spectral features betray the presence of dense ( @xmath32 ) medium of @xmath33 near the site of the explosion ( @xmath34 ) ( piro 1999b ) .",
    "such a medium should have been pre - ejected before the grb explosion , but the large value of the density excludes stellar winds . a possible , intriguing explanation is that the shell is the result of a sn explosion preceding the grb ( piro 1999b , vietri 1999 , vietri & stella 1998 ) .",
    "other evidences argue in favour of the association grb - sn . in the bepposax error box of grb980425 ( pian 1999 ) two groups ( kulkarni 1998b , galama 1998 ) found a supernova ( sn1998bw ) that had exploded at about the same time of the grb .",
    "the probability of a chance coincidence of the two events is @xmath35 .",
    "since the majority of grb are not associated with sn ( e.g. graziani 1999 ) , this event ( if the association is true ) should apparently represent an uncommon kind of grb .",
    "however it is also possible that the two families are indeed associated : this scenario would require that the grb are emitted by collimated jets .",
    "the majority of grb and afterglow we see are beamed towards us , so that the contribution of the supernova to the total emission is negligible .",
    "the case of sn1998bw was then particular in that the jet producing the grb was collimated away from our line of sight , allowing the detection of the ( isotropic ) sn emission at an early phase .",
    "this scenario also explains why grb980425 was not particularly bright , notwithstanding its redshift ( z=0.0085 ) , much lower than the typical value of the other grb ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "since the afterglow decays as a power law , it is possible that at late times the emission of the sn becomes detectable .",
    "evidence of such emission has been claimed in at least two cases ( grb990326 : bloom 1999b ; grb970228 : reichart 1999 )",
    "several bits of evidence supporting the association of grb to star - forming regions have been gathered so far .",
    "the potential perspectives of this link are extremely exciting .",
    "being grb the most powerful and distant sources of ionizing photons , we can think of using them as probes of heavy elements and star / galaxy formation in the early universe . a direct proof of this association is still missing but the near future appears very promising in this respect .",
    "bepposax is discovering and localizing grb and x - ray afterglows at a pace of 1 per month .",
    "other satellites have also set up with success procedures for rapid grb localization ( batse , xte , asca and ipn ) .",
    "the launch of hete2 , foreseen in early 2000 will increase substantially the number of well localized grb .",
    "furthermore present and near - future big x - ray satellites , like chandra , xmm , astro - e will allow detailed spectral studies of x - ray afterglows and provide ( chandra ) arcsec position of x - ray counterparts and , possibly , a direct redshift determination .",
    "the bepposax results presented here were obtained through the joint effort of all the components of the bepposax team .",
    "bepposax is a major program of the italian space agency ( asi ) with participation of the netherlands agency for aerospace programs ( nivr )"
