    "spin correlated condensates of spin - one atoms have attracted considerable interest since 1998@xcite .",
    "two - body scattering between atoms leads to either antiferromagnetic ( polar ) or ferromagnetic condensates@xcite . for spin - one bosons with antiferromagnetic interactions , the condensates break both the rotational symmetry and the @xmath0 symmetry associated with the phases of the condensates .",
    "there are two branches of spin - wave excitations and one gapless phason mode . for a condensate of a finite size ,",
    "the exact ground state however is a spin singlet ( assuming the total number of atoms is even ) which on the other hand is extremely sensitive to external perturbations@xcite . in rotating traps",
    ", two - body scatterings furthermore result in spin correlated fractional quantum hall states@xcite .    in lattices where the hopping is small , bosonic particles can be localized because of repulsive interactions and ground states in this limit are mott insulators@xcite .",
    "mott - insulating states of cold atoms have been recently observed in optical lattices@xcite .",
    "spin correlated mott - insulating states in high dimensional optical lattices have also been investigated theoretically and reported in @xcite .",
    "both nematic mott insulators which break the rotational symmetry and spin singlet mott insulating states were found for high dimensional lattices in certain parameter regime .",
    "other spin correlated states which break both translational and rotational symmetries were proposed in@xcite .",
    "effects of spin correlations on mott insulator - superfluid transitions were suggested and remain to be fully understood@xcite .",
    "very recently , detailed analysises of microscopic wave functions and phase transitions between spin singlet mott insulators and nematic ones have been carried out@xcite . in the context of antiferromagnets ,",
    "the issue of spin nematic states was raised and addressed previously@xcite .    to distinguish different correlated states of spin - one bosons in a lattice , it is useful to introduce the following order parameters in terms of creation and annihilation operators @xmath1 , @xmath2 respectively ( @xmath3 ) ;    @xmath4    in eq.[op ] , we have employed the following creation operators    @xmath5    where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , are creation operators of spin- one bosons with @xmath8 .    in terms of these order parameters , polar condensates ( pbec ) ,",
    "nematic mott insulators(nmi ) and spin singlet mott insulating states ( ssmi ) have the following properties    @xmath9    finally , for all states of cold atoms with antiferromagnetic interactions which interest us in this paper , the expectation value of spin operators is zero    @xmath10    spin correlations in mott - insulating states also depend on the even - odd parity of numbers of atoms per site .",
    "while spin correlated mott states for even numbers of atoms per site have been studied and understood , states for odd numbers of atoms per site remain to be fully understood . in one - dimensional optical lattices , it was argued that spin singlet mott states for an odd number of atoms per site should be dimerized - valence - bond crystal ( dvbc ) states@xcite .",
    "these dvbc states are characterized by the following nontrivial spin correlations :    @xmath11    when @xmath12 approaches @xmath13 ( for either all even @xmath14 or all odd @xmath14 only ) .",
    "later , we present more evidence for the existence of dvbc mott states ; certain aspects of long wave length behaviors of dvbcs found for spin - one bosons are similar to those of dvbc states in @xmath15 spin chains@xcite .    valence - bond crystal states and more generally spin - peirls states have been proposed in various models for strongly correlated electrons .",
    "possible spin - peirls states in 2d antiferromagnets ( disordered ) due to berry s phases carried by hedgehogs were pointed out in @xcite . in _",
    "su(n)_-antiferromagnet models or their effective models , valence- bond crystal phases were discovered in various limits@xcite .",
    "most recently , valence - bond crystals in strongly - correlated systems due to berry s phases in ising gauge fields were addressed@xcite . in quantum dimer models ,",
    "crystal phases have been anticipated in@xcite , and were reviewed in a recent paper@xcite .",
    "condensates for spin - one bosons with antiferromagnetic interactions in lattices also have fascinating properties ; most of arguments in the weakly interacting case can be carried out parallel to those developed for the continuous limit .",
    "particularly , ground state wave functions should possess ising gauge symmetries ; and condensates support interesting half - vortex - type topological excitations in additional to usual integer vortices@xcite .",
    "furthermore , the local spin dynamics is described by a nonlinear sigma model ; for an individual condensate in a zero - mode approximation , a constrained @xmath16-quantum - rotor model can be introduced to characterize the spin dynamics . due to spin - phase separation",
    "there are a variety of novel spin correlated `` condensates '' ; particularly , we will argue that there should be spin singlet quantum condensates ( ssqcs ) , in addition to usual polar condensates .",
    "early indication for spin singlet quantum condensates , or rotationally invariant condensates came from the analysis of renormalization - group equations .",
    "the phenomenon of spin - phase separation implies that orders be established in either phase , or spin sector but not necessary in both . particularly , there exist rotationally invariant superfluid states@xcite .",
    "in fact , the failure of order parameters ( when treated as quantum operators ) to commute with the hamiltonian eventually leads to these fascinating many - body condensates of spin - one bosons . from this point of view",
    ", a polar condensate is a `` classical '' one , of which order parameter operators can be approximated as classical variables .",
    "the second relevant observation on spin singlet condensates was made in @xcite .",
    "there , the authors consider a limit where two - body repulsive interactions in ferromagnetic channels are much stronger than in singlet channels . in this limit , atoms form singlet pairs and condense ; the resultant state is a condensate of spin singlet pairs .",
    "the solution in this limit is consistent with general arguments based on renormalization - group equations ; furthermore , it indicates a microscopic realization of rotationally invariant condensates suggested by renormalization - group equations . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors further analyzed a few other spin singlet states , some of which break time reserval symmetry and have fascinating edge properties .",
    "the most recent indication of ssqcs is the phenomenon of fractionalization in some mott states .",
    "consider each cold atom as a particle with spin @xmath15 and `` charge '' @xmath17 .",
    "the spin-``charge '' separation in mott insulating states for spin - one bosons with antiferromagnetic interactions implies fractionalization of cold atoms in optical lattices ; it also offers some insight into microscopic wavefunctions of fractionalized condensates .",
    "the ground state of interacting spin - one bosons in the strong coupling limit can be a dvbc ; and this state supports either spinful but chargeless quasi - particles or charged but spinless quasi - particles in one - dimensional limit@xcite .",
    "the low - energy sector of the hilbert space can thus be divided into two subsectors of spin and charge .",
    "all the low lying excitations live in one of these two sectors .",
    "therefore , each atom injected into a lattice naturally fractionalizes into spinless _",
    "charge - e _ ( @xmath18 ) excitations and chargeless but spinful ( @xmath19 ) excitations . theoretically ,",
    "the novel ssqcs appear naturally as a result of condensation of spinless charge - e bosons . in this article , we substantialize those proposals made in @xcite ; particularly we demonstrate the microscopic structure of possible charge - e spin singlet condensates @xcite .",
    "the fractionalization of cold atoms to be discussed in this article is an analogy of spin - charge separation proposed in strongly interacting electron systems . for strongly - correlated electrons in cuprates ,",
    "the concept of spin - charge separation was emphasised in @xcite ; the phenomenon of spin - charge separation in doped anti - ferromagnets was studied afterwards in terms of effective compact gauge fields @xcite .",
    "many attempts have since then been made to understand the fractionalization of electrons in cuprates @xcite . in some subsequential works , fractionalization in quantum spin liquids was investigated in the context of effective ising gauge theories @xcite .",
    "most recent efforts on this subject can be found in @xcite ; especially , superconducting states of `` chargons '' ( charge - e objects ) have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "some general discussions on spin - charge separation can be found in a remarkable book @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that from the point of view of fractionalized atoms , in some mott insulating states only a fraction of each spin - one boson appears to be `` localized '' ; these states display rather interesting internal coherence as a result of `` partial condensation '' .",
    "for instance , nematic mott insulating states can be effectively considered as condensates of fractionalized spinful but chargeless particles or spin - one _ spinons_. in appendix c , we examine spin correlated mott states from this point of view .",
    "our discussions will be limited to cases of integer numbers of bosons per site ; condensates for non - integer numbers of bosons per site will be addressed in a future paper .",
    "in this article , we develop a general approach for the studies of spin singlet states .",
    "first , we demonstrate that all ssmis can be fully characterized by even- and odd - class quantum dimer models . in the second part of the article",
    ", we pursue the idea of ssqcs of spin - one bosons in lattices ; particularly , we provide various evidence for these unconventional spin correlated condensates . in ssqcs , condensation takes place only in the charge sector of the hilbert space .",
    "ssqcs therefore exhibit distinct long - range order .",
    "it is possible to distinguish them from pbecs in experiments because of remarkably distinct macroscopic properties of ssqcs .    in section",
    "ii , we summarize results on spin- correlated mott states of spin - one bosons in lattices and present microscopic wavefunctions for some of the states . in section iii , we investigate spin singlet mott states for odd numbers of atoms per site in one - dimensional lattices in the extremely small hopping limit . in section iv , we discuss excitations in spin singlet mott states ; we demonstrate the fractionalization of spin - one atoms in dvbcs in one - dimensional lattices . in section",
    "v , we present a qualitative picture of ssqcs using a projected spin singlet hilbert space ; we argue that spin correlations strongly suppress one - particle hopping in an ssmi for an even number of bosons per site . in section",
    "vi , we introduce a fractionalized representation for interacting spin - one bosons in a lattice . in section vii",
    ", we briefly present results on ssmis and ssqcs in high dimensional lattices . in section viii",
    ", we revisit low - dimensional ssmis using an approach based on quantum dimer models ; particularly , we generalize the results on one - dimensional lattices in section iii to the entire mott phase ( one - dimensional ) . in section ix , we discuss ssqcs in one - dimensional lattices . in section",
    "x , we address the issue of the possible role of berry s phases in one - dimensional lattices .",
    "it was demonstrated and emphasized in a few occasions that the problem of interacting spin - one bosons can be mapped into a constrained quantum rotor model ( cqr ) @xcite .",
    "technically , this allows one to acquire certain valuable intuition about many strongly - correlated states of spin - one bosons using the knowledge about the renormalization - group equations and topological field theories .",
    "the mapping is therefore a powerful device to study properties of spin - one bosons in optical lattices .",
    "the resultant cqr model will be our starting point for the studies of spin - one bosons in lattices .",
    "for spin - one bosons with antiferromagnetic interactions in ( optical ) lattices , the effective hamiltonian can be conveniently expressed as @xmath20 where the sum @xmath21 is carried out over neighboring sites @xmath12 and @xmath22 ; in this section , we are only interested in high dimensional bipartite lattices .    in eq.[hami0 ] , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two energy gaps in the excitation spectra of an individual condensate at each site .",
    "@xmath25 is the hopping integral ; @xmath26 is the chemical potential .",

    "the ground state for an isolated site with @xmath36 atoms is a spin singlet and for @xmath38 is a spin triplet@xcite .",
    "therefore at low energies , the hilbert space of the hamiltonian is subject to a constraint that the sum of the number of particles @xmath39 and the total spin @xmath40 , has to be an even number so that the many - boson wave function is symmetric under interchange of two spin - one particles",
    ". say it differently , the hilbert space displays the following selection rule    @xmath41    this * selection rule * plays an extremely important role in both symmetry breaking states and spin singlet mott insulating states@xcite .    in optical lattices",

    "first , elitzur theorem claims that in the presence of local gauge invariance , operators such as @xmath522 , @xmath217 , @xmath523 which transform nontrivially under the local gauge transformation can not develop nonzero expectation values@xcite .",
    "the existence of fqcs which so far is explicitly demonstrated in a fixed gauge at first sight appears to be at odds with the elitzur theorem .",
    "the apparent paradox can be formally resolved if one carries out a similar calculation in terms of gauge invariant correlators and confirms long range order .        where the products are carried over links along path @xmath525 and @xmath526 .",
    "@xmath527 is a path connecting @xmath12 and @xmath22 site and @xmath526 is a closed path of four times as long .",
    "these correlation functions characterize the condensates when the gauge fields are weakly interacting@xcite .",
    "gauge invariant correlators suggest that it should not be bare @xmath194- or @xmath195-particles but some nonlocal `` particles '' which condense .",
    "one such candidate is an @xmath194 or @xmath195-particle dressed in a string of gauge fields          these particles can condense without violating the elitzur theorem . on the other hand",
    "they carry exactly the same charge and spin as bare particles of @xmath230 and @xmath208 .",
    "we speculate that condensation of @xmath194 or @xmath195-particles in a fixed gauge might also imply condensation of particles created by @xmath531 and @xmath532 .",
    "the second remark concerns the relation between charge - e ssqcs and previously discussed spin singlet paired condensates or charge-2e ssqcs@xcite .",
    "both condensates are rotationally invariant spin singlets and both are phase coherent . however , from the point of view of correlations it is obvious that charge - e ssqc does nt involve pairing of particles and differs from paired condensates .",
    "an explicit construction of wave functions of charge - e ssqc is difficult but available . at the time of writing , we believe that fqcs represent condensation of some topological solitons which in short are called as @xmath194- , @xmath195- particles . particularly , charge - e ssqcs should exist in lattices with both non - integer and integer numbers of atoms per site .",
