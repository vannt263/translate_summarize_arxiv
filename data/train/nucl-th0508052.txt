    "the last few years witnessed a tremendous progress toward the construction of microscopic models for nuclear masses .",
    "most promising for such an endeavor is self - consistent mean - field theory ( scmf ) , also called density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite for a recent review . since the work of tondeur _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , fits of self - consistent mean - field models to all experimentally known masses have become available",
    ". however , the fits are only competitive with the _ de facto _ standard of mass formulae , the finite - range liquid drop model ( frdm ) @xcite , when phenomenological corrections are added for certain correlation effects .",
    "namely , a rotational energy correction is added when the mean field state breaks spherical symmetry , and a wigner term is added to account for the stronger neutron - proton correlation in nuclei having nearly equal numbers of neutrons and protons @xcite .",
    "the quality of the fits , either frdm or mean - field + corrections , is in the range of 0.6 - 0.7 mev rms .",
    "some time ago , bohigas and leboeuf @xcite opened a discussion on limits of accuracy of theories of the nuclear masses by arguing that chaotic contributions to the nuclear wave function will ultimately limit the accuracy of any mean - field approach .",
    "their rough estimate for this limit is a rms deviation of @xmath1 kev ( see eq.([eq : sigmarms ] ) for its definition ) , which is only slightly below the values achieved in the frdm and the mean - field + corrections . on the other hand ,",
    "applying noise analysis to available mass theories of various types , barea _",
    "et al . _",
    "argue in ref .",
    "@xcite that the upper limit of mass predictability should be well below 100 kev .",
    "they find that global mass theories such as the frdm or the hfb show correlated errors .",
    "only the much better performing local mass models , as for example the garvey - kelson ( gk ) mass formulas @xcite with a @xmath2 as low as 86 kev , have residual errors which are consistent with white noise .",
    "another interesting recent analysis was made by molinari and weidenmller @xcite , who computed the effect on the ground state energy of the fluctuations associated with the coupling to states at tens of mev of excitation .",
    "the estimate in their fig .",
    "1 is about 100 kev , again much smaller than the accuracy achieved by the global mass fits . summarizing the current status of the discussion about the limits of mass theories",
    ", it is likely that the current limit of about 600 kev is `` not a physical phenomenon , but rather a characteristic arising from the mean - field approximation '' , to quote the conclusion of ref.@xcite .",
    "even the limit of 600 kev may be optimistic .",
    "indeed , stripping away all phenomenological corrections , it was found in ref .",
    "@xcite that scmf theories based on skyrme parameterizations only achieve a factor of two improvement over the liquid drop model , yielding rms residuals in the range 1.5 - 1.7 mev .",
    "the need for explicit treatment of correlations should not be surprising .",
    "a remarkable fact about nuclear structure physics is that the mean field approach works as well as it does , given the strong short - range character of the nucleon - nucleon interaction . in this respect ,",
    "the nuclear problem is much more difficult than the problem of structure and binding of electronic systems .",
    "there , the interaction is smooth and the self - consistent field is a very good starting point .",
    "what saves the theory for nuclear systems is the fact that the correlations induced by the interaction largely have a short range themselves .",
    "this makes it plausible that they can be subsumed in an effective interaction . but not all correlation effects can be included by a renormalization of a short - range interaction .",
    "the electronic problem provides a nice example of this . in the usual kohn - sham theory ,",
    "the energy functional is local or nearly local except for the kinetic energy and electrostatic interactions .",
    "this is quite inadequate to describe the long - range van der waals interaction , which is absent in the mean - field wave function and thus a pure correlation effect .",
    "another way that long - range correlations come about is when a symmetry is broken in the mean field and in the corresponding density matrix . in the nuclear many - body problem ,",
    "translational symmetry is always broken and rotational symmetry may or may not be broken depending on the nucleus .",
    "the true ground state of course has the symmetry restored , and the additions to the wave function that bring about the symmetry restoration are correlation effects that are necessarily long - range when the symmetry is a global one",
    ". from the point of view of making a theory of the masses , there are two important questions .",
    "the first is how large are the correlation energies associated with broken symmetries . unless their size is greater than the target accuracy of theory , they can be ignored .",
    "in fact , both the center - of - mass energy and the rotational energy are large compared to the 600 kev present - day standard .",
    "the second question is how much the energy fluctuates from nucleus to nucleus .",
    "if the correlation energy varies very smoothly , it could remain unnoticed in a theory based on a fitted energy functional .",
    "this seems to be the case for the center - of - mass energy . while its size can be of the order of 10 mev for the lighter nuclei , its fluctuations are much less important than those of the quadrupolar degrees of freedom ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is more precarious for the rotational energy .",
    "it fluctuates considerably from nucleus to nucleus , vanishing for spherical nuclei and having a magnitude of the order of several mev for deformed nuclei .",
    "this provides a motivation to calculate this correlation energy explicitly rather than keeping it buried as part of the mean - field energy functional .",
    "however , it is dubious to treat it as a discrete quantity , present in some nuclei but not in others",
    ". the shape can fluctuate and the binary classification of spherical or deformed nuclei should be replaced by a continuum starting from rigid spherical , through soft transitional to statically deformed nuclei .",
    "thus , one is led to seek a theory of the correlation energy that would include the energy associated with zero - point shape fluctuations as well as static deformations .",
    "there are two leading candidates for a systematic and practical theory of long - range correlations effects taking mean field theory as the starting point .",
    "these are the rpa , generalized to qrpa in the presence of pairing , and the generator coordinate method ( gcm ) .",
    "the rpa has an impeccable pedigree in quantum many - body theory , solving a long - range divergence problem in the calculation of the correlation energy for coulomb interactions .",
    "however , balancing this are a number of drawbacks which we list :    * rpa does not converge well when the interactions are short ranged @xcite .",
    "this becomes obvious when one notes that second - order perturbation theory for a contact interaction diverges , and that the usual formula for the rpa correlation energy incorporates the second - order perturbation .",
    "* as a small - amplitude approximation , qrpa can not be expected to give a good description of the correlated ground state in soft transitional nuclei and nuclei with coexisting minima , where the ground - state is spread over a wide range of deformations .",
    "none of these problems of rpa are necessarily insurmountable . concerning the convergence",
    ", one might explicitly exclude the second - order perturbation term to eliminate the divergence .",
    "alternatively , one could regularize the interaction in some way .",
    "along these lines , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite calculated rpa correlation energies in the sn isotope chain using nuclear field theory , a theory that replaces the microscopic particle - hole interaction with a surface - peaked multipole interaction .",
    "the criticism of rpa that it is limited to small amplitudes is not entirely justified in practice : it can treat the correlation energy associated with symmetry restorations which are large amplitude effects @xcite , although the quality of this approximate symmetry restoration is not always very good @xcite .",
    "the other leading contender for a theory of correlation effects is the gcm , which we favor and apply in this work .",
    "the essential idea is that one considers a manifold of mean - field states in an external field , different strengths of the external field generating different states .",
    "the important point is that the space is essentially determined by the functional form of the external field . once the field or the set of fields is specified , the theory is completely systematic and applicable to all nuclei for which the mean field is a reasonable starting point .",
    "the gcm is a",
    " horizontal `` extended theory in that the added parts to the wave function are low energy configurations , because they were obtained by the mean - field minimization procedure .",
    "this contrasts to the rpa approach , which invokes a ' ' vertical \" extension of the wave function to arbitrary high energy , but to only states that can be accessed by a one - body operator . since we mentioned a number of drawbacks of ( q)rpa",
    ", we also make a similar list for the gcm .",
    "namely :    * convergence can be an issue on a numerical level .",
    "the theory is usually couched in terms of a continuum of mean - field states , but in practice computations are carried out with finite sets of states .",
    "if there are too many states in the basis of non - orthogonal states , they will be redundant and the matrix techniques to find the lowest energy state become unstable .",
    "* for numerical reasons , we are limited at present to a single external field .",
    "we take it to be the isoscalar axial quadrupole field , @xmath3 leaving out higher multipoles and non - axial quadrupolar deformations . * already for excitations , it may be insufficient to take only the single generating field from eqn .",
    "( [ eq : q_2 ] ) .",
    "this suspicion is raised by systematic overestimations of quadrupole excitations in rigid spherical nuclei @xcite .    in the present paper we aim at a systematic study of the quadrupole correlation energy for all even - even nuclei where the mass is known .",
    "the quadrupole correlation can be expected to be the dominant correlation mode for all but doubly magic nuclei , so this is at least a reasonable first step to a complete theory .",
    "starting from a self - consistent mean - field model based on skyrme s interaction , we restore particle - number and rotational symmetry and perform a configuration mixing of states with different quadrupole moment .",
    "our approach does not aim at a nuclear mass formula , but has the long - range goal of a universal nuclear model that allows for the simultaneous consistent and systematic description of many observables , including excited states , for all nuclei .",
    "such a strategy has obvious advantages for the most prominent application of nuclear mass formula , the description of nucleosynthesis in astrophysics .",
    "for example , the dynamics of the @xmath4 process of explosive nucleosynthesis is determined by many nuclear properties @xcite , with masses being just the simplest one .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sect : calc ] , we present the equations to be solved and discuss some technical aspects . in section [ sect : examples ] , the physics of quadrupole correlations is discussed on a few typical examples . a systematic calculation for the correlation energies of 605 even - even nuclei",
    "is presented in section [ sect : correlations : overview ] while in sect .",

    "are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : summary ] .",
    "some of the key results for quadrupole correlation energies have been presented earlier in a letter @xcite .",
    "we start with a set of self - consistent solutions of the hf+bcs generated with the code ev8 @xcite .",
    "the single - particle wave functions are discretized on a three - dimensional lagrange mesh @xcite corresponding to a cubic box .",
    "the only restriction of the wave function is that the slater determinant of the orbits is invariant with respect to parity , time reversal , and axial rotations . as in earlier studies , we use a fixed mesh spacing of 0.8 fm .",
    "the length of the box side ranges from 25.6 to 28.8 fm with the nucleus at the center . to avoid the breakdown of pairing correlations for small level densities around the fermi surface , we perform an approximate projection - before - variation on particle number within the lipkin - nogami ( ln ) scheme as outlined in @xcite . states with different mass quadrupole moments",
    "are generated by adding a constraint to the mean - field equations to force the quadrupole moment , eqn .",
    "( [ eq : q_2 ] ) , to have some value @xmath5 higher even axial multipole moments are automatically optimized for a given mass quadrupole moment . for numerical stability of the constrained mean - field equations in light nuclei ,",
    "the constraint is damped at large distances from the nuclear surface with the method proposed by rutz _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the skyrme interaction sly4 @xcite is used for the energy - density functional in the particle - hole channel .",
    "pairing effects are treated in the bcs approximation using a density - dependent zero - range force , truncated above and below the fermi surface as described in ref .  @xcite .",
    "as in earlier studies , the pairing strength is taken to be @xmath6 mev @xmath7 for both protons and neutrons .    while the wave functions are constructed using the code ev8 , all energies and matrix elements are calculated with another code , promesse @xcite , which uses a more accurate algorithm for the kinetic energy . for scmf energies",
    ", this code has an accuracy for a mesh size of 0.8  fm given roughly by 0.007 @xmath8 mev , where @xmath8 is the mass number .",
    "this error varies quite smoothly with @xmath8 . for even better accuracy",
    ", the mesh spacing should be decreased .",
    "highly accurate scmf calculations are also achieved using a deformed harmonic oscillator basis ; see ref.@xcite for code details .",
    "the application of the generator coordinate method that we do here goes beyond mean field in three respects : projections on good particle numbers , projection on angular momentum , and mixing deformations .",
    "projection is a special case of the gcm , where the collective path and the weight functions are determined by the restored symmetry .",
    "angular - momentum projection mixes states with all the possible orientations of the quadrupole tensor and therefore generates part of the quadrupole correlations . for this reason , to introduce consistently quadrupole correlations , the mixing of states with respect to the quadrupole moment by the gcm should be performed together with an angular - momentum projection .",
    "eigenstates of the particle - number operator @xmath9 with an even eigenvalue @xmath10 are obtained by applying the particle - number projection operator @xmath11 separately for protons and neutrons .",
    "all the results presented in this paper include particle - number projection and we drop the indices @xmath10 and @xmath12 to simplify the notations . to avoid the use of the lipkin - nogami correction of mean - field energies which is known to be often inaccurate ,",
    "the mean - field energies corresponding to the skyrme and pairing interactions have been recalculated by projecting the scmf states on particle number .",
    "thus , in the following , what we call scmf energy is in fact the energy corresponding to a particle - number projected scmf state .",
    "this projection is always performed on mean - field states which have @xmath10 and @xmath12 as average particle numbers .",
    "formally , eigenstates @xmath13 of the angular momentum operators @xmath14 and @xmath15 with eigenvalues and @xmath16 are obtained by applying the operator @xmath17 on the states @xmath18 .",
    "the rotation operator @xmath19 and the wigner function @xmath20 both depend on the euler angles @xmath21 . in practice",
    ", we shall simplify the 3-dimensional integral over euler angles to a one - dimensional integral ( see eqns .",
    "( [ eq : norm : kernel : exact]-[eq : ham : kernel : exact ] ) below ) .",

    "here we are only interested in the ground state .",
    "note that the exact number projection avoids some problems that may arise in calculating hwg matrix elements with bcs wave functions @xcite .",
    "the angular momentum projection simplifies to a one - dimensional integral when the mean - field states are axial and time - reversal invariant .",
    "we take the @xmath30 axis as a symmetry axis and the mean - field states as eigenstates of the @xmath30 projection of the angular momentum in the intrinsic frame , with eigenvalue .",

    "another technical problem that appears at the level of solving the hwg equation ( [ eq : hwg ] ) is the possible over - completeness of the basis states @xmath35 .",
    "this can lead to problems of numerical stability , see sect .",

    "we remind the reader again that @xmath141 does not have a physical significance when the deformation is weak .      in many applications ,",

    "the overall upward shift when going from the top panel to the bottom panel in figs .",

    ", the agreement is more satisfactory when removing the lightest nuclei with @xmath127 , from the sample as shown in the two right columns of table [ rms : table : radii : all ] .      as dynamical correlations lead to an overall increase of the rms radii , any assessment on the role of dynamical correlations for radii",
    "can not be made on the grounds of the rms residuals .",
    "as in the case of masses , the improvements brought by correlations are better seen when looking at isotopic shifts which are differences of radii : @xmath166 in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr2:sn : pb ] , the isotopic shifts for the chains of sn and pb isotopes are compared with experimental data .",
    "quadrupole correlations play a minor role for sn isotopes .",
    "they lead to a slight increase for mid - shell nuclei only which improves the agreement between calculation and experiment .",
    "similar results have been obtained in a gcm calculation without projection in ref  @xcite .",
    "the situation is somewhat different for pb isotopes .",
    "let us first examine the isotopes below @xmath80pb .",
    "for spherical mean fields , the radii vary nearly linearly with @xmath127 . allowing for deformation ,",
    "a few neutron - rich isotopes around have an oblate ground state giving a larger radius compared to a spherical state .",
    "this is seen as a bump in fig.[fig : dr2:sn : pb ] . when dynamical correlations are included , the mean deformation of the correlated ground state decreases and their radii are intermediate between those of purely spherical and deformed mean - field calculations .",
    "compared to experiment , there are some deviations from the linearity of the spherical mean field , but not as much as predicted by the gcm .",
    "note that the appearance of a deformed mean - field ground states around @xmath167pb is very sensitive to the strength of the pairing interaction .",
    "increasing it to @xmath168 mev @xmath169 , as used in ref .",
    "@xcite , pushes the oblate minimum up by a few 100 kev , leading to a spherical mean - field ground state for all pb isotopes . turning to the isotopes above @xmath80pb",
    ", one sees a change in the slope of the isotope shifts in the data that is not reproduced by theory .",
    "some authors explain the data by using an isospin dependence of the spin - orbit interaction @xcite different from that in sly4 and which appears naturally in relativistic lagrangians .",
    "more drastic changes can be expected for nuclei further away from shell closures .",
    "the isotopic shifts in the xe ( ) , ba ( ) , and nd ( ) and sm ( ) isotopic chains . are shown in figures [ fig : dr2:xe : ba ] and [ fig : dr2:nd : sm ] as examples of transitions from near - spherical to well - deformed ground states along isotopic chains . in all these cases ,",
    "spherical mean - field calculations are obviously unable to describe the trends of the radii . with the exception of the isotopes , all nuclei in figs .",
    "[ fig : dr2:xe : ba ] and [ fig : dr2:nd : sm ] are deformed , hence the static quadrupole correlations in mean - field ground states increase the radii on both sides of the shell , thereby decreasing the isotope shifts below and increasing them above .",
    "the up - bend above the shell seems to be fairly independent on the proton number and is always well - described .",
    "the difference between the scmf ground state and the projected gcm ground state is in most cases quite small .",
    "although dynamical correlations slightly increase them , the isotopic shifts just above the magic number are always slightly underestimated .",
    "the situation is different below the shell .",
    "going from ( xe ) to ( ba ) substantially increases the radii for mid - shell nuclei .    as a final example in fig .",
    "[ fig : dr2:yb : ra ] , we show two isotopic chains that cross a transition from spherical to strongly deformed nuclei , yb ( ) and ra ( ) .",
    "these are among the mid - shell chains for which the largest sets of data are available .",
    "a detailed discussion of the isotopic shifts in the yb ( and also the pb ) chain at the mean - field level can be found in ref .",
    "the effect of deformation is clearly visible in the yb chain .",
    "static mean - field deformations bring the overall trend of the radii close to experiment , while dynamical correlations provide an additional small correction .",
    "an interesting feature is that we find an offset between our calculations and experiment for most nuclei except the neutron - magic @xmath170yb .",
    "the radius does not increase fast enough when going from to .",
    "this was already hinted in the case of the xe , ba , nd and sm isotopic chains , but it appears in a more pronounced way for yb .",
    "there could be several sources for this discrepancy .",
    "correlation modes that we do not consider here should play some role around magic numbers .",
    "our results on mass systematics have also indicated that the gap is too large . as a consequence ,",
    "the potential landscapes are too stiff , preventing the spreading of the collective ground state .",
    "compared to the yb isotopes , the radii of the ra isotopes vary on a smaller scale as shown in the right panel of fig.[fig : dr2:yb : ra ] .",
    "static deformation increases the radii on both sides of the shell closure , in agreement with the available data . adding dynamical correlations leaves the isotopic shifts practically unchanged .",
    "self - consistent mean - field ( scmf ) methods provide the only microscopic nuclear model that can be applied to all nuclei up to the heaviest ones . in spite of their many successes ,",
    "the scmf models do not deliver nuclear masses with a satisfactory accuracy if phenomenological corrections are not added .",
    "we have studied how dynamical quadrupole correlations , calculated consistently from scmf states , influence masses and charge radii . using a numerical approximation to compute the matrix elements required for angular momentum projection and configuration mixing , it has been possible to calculate the quadrupole correlation energy for 600 even - even nuclei .",
    "we estimate a numerical uncertainty on correlation energies of at most 200 kev , which is acceptable for the purpose of our study .",
    "scmf masses determined with the skyrme interaction sly4 have two main wrong tendencies : a global drift with mass number , and arches between shell closures .",
    "similar results have also been obtained for other skyrme interactions .",
    "the drift with mass number is related to a slightly too small ( approximately by 0.5 @xmath67 ) volume energy coefficient of the nuclear matter properties , that can be assumed to be an artifact of the common practice of fitting the force to a very limited set of nuclei .",
    "the mismatch can be easily removed by a perturbative refit of the particle - hole part of the effective mean - field interaction to a larger set of nuclear masses , while leaving the pairing interaction untouched .",
    "the arches are obviously related to shell structure , and can not be removed at the mean - field level by a perturbative refit of a given interaction . including quadrupolar correlations brings a large improvement ; they have the right qualitative behavior , and also the right order of magnitude . with the original skyrme interaction sly4",
    ", the amplitude of the arches is decreased .",
    "the residuals of the masses remain still large , but in particular mass differences around magic numbers become rather accurate .",
    "the improvements brought by correlations are smaller when included in a refit , but clearly are present for angular momentum projection ; the overall improvement of the gcm is small and can not be determined using a linear refit .",
    "surprisingly , the mismatch of masses related to shell effects is much more pronounced when residuals are plotted for isotopic chains as a function of the neutron number . in plots made as a function of the proton number or of the mass asymmetry ,",
    "the residuals are much less structured .",
    "the role of dynamical correlations for radii has many similarities with their role for masses .",
    "correlations lead to an overall increase of radii that spoils the rms residuals for an interaction adjusted at the mean - field level . on the other hand ,",
    "differences between radii are improved by correlations , the largest effect being obtained in mass regions where radii vary rapidly from isotope to the next , in particular for transitional nuclei and around magic numbers.the examples shown for isotopic shifts demonstrate that the dynamical quadrupole correlations indeed contain the right physics to improve the description of the ground states of transitional nuclei .",
    "the aim of this paper was not to set up a new mass formula , microscopic and as accurate as the best available theories including phenomenological terms .",
    "this could only be done by refitting the effective interactions in both the mean - field and the pairing channels after the inclusion of correlations .",
    "before to attack this formidable task , our more limited aim here was to determine the effect of correlations on residuals of binding energies and to see whether they have the right tendencies to remove the deficiencies of pure mean - field calculations .",
    "our results for binding energies are encouraging in this respect .",
    "energy differences are less sensitive to wrong global trends of effective interactions and the fact that they are significantly improved by correlations is a clear sign of the necessity to go beyond the mean field .",
    "the spreading of the nuclear wave function over a large range of deformed mean - field states does not only influence binding energies .",
    "it has a large effect on other observables as well .",
    "we have examined a few representative examples of nuclear radii and isotopic shifts .",
    "other observables require an extension of the present study to excited states .    what should be done to go further ?",
    "we can distinguish several main roads which should ideally be followed in parallel but which all require new developments of different difficulties .",
    "* from the analysis of mass residuals we conclude that the poor description of masses around heavy doubly - magic nuclei is due to a deficiency of the skyrme energy functional , and is not primarily the manifestation of large missing correlations .",
    "this might be a hint that the present skyrme energy functionals are not yet flexible enough . to improve the mean field used as a starting point",
    ", generalizations of the energy functional might be necessary .",
    "the fit of mean - field interactions should exclude nuclei , since the wigner energy is large and not well known .",
    "clearly , a fit protocol which takes into account only magic nuclei is not sufficient . *",
    "the generalization of the present formalism to the study of low - lying excited states , in particular to the first @xmath111 state and its decay by @xmath171 transitions to the ground state . * the inclusion of additional collective modes .",
    "a nice feature of our study is that correlations seem to saturate and that the gain of energy for the ground state is small when introducing more correlations .",
    "however , in some mass regions , they should affect differently nuclei with different deformation topographies .",
    "three modes seem the most natural ones looking to some deficiencies noticed in the present study . the octupole mode is certainly missing in some heavy nuclei and",
    "should also be as important as the axial quadrupole mode near magic nuclei .",
    "the effect of triaxiality has to be tested in nuclei with coexisting mean - field prolate and oblate minima which , although already coupled even if only axial deformations are considered , could be more strongly linked through the triaxial plane . finally , pairing has been treated within the lipkin - nogami approach , which is known to have deficiencies , in particular in the weak pairing regime . to include the pairing gap as a dynamical variable",
    "would certainly be more satisfactory . * up to now ,",
    "we have considered only even nuclei .",
    "it is clear that a more complete theory should also include odd ones .",
    "however , a treatment of odd nuclei at the same level of quality than even ones will require an extension of our model to break time - reversal invariance and axial symmetry .",
    "this work is underway but it is quite clear that the restoration of symmetries for odd nuclei will lead to a considerable increase of the computing time . *",
    "the discussion of differences of energies and radii demonstrates that the introduction of quadrupole correlations brings in physics which is not included in self - consistent mean - field models and improves the systematics of ground state observables around shell closures .",
    "however , as we discussed several times in this paper , effective interactions have been adjusted at the mean - field level and are not adequate to include correlations .",
    "nuclei whose masses were included in the determination of the interaction are over - bound by correlations .",
    "a linear refit of the mean - field part of the interaction permits to correct wrong tendencies of the interaction in a simple manner but is not sufficient for a quantitative study when configuration mixing is included .",
    "this is not surprising , since configuration mixing is very sensitive to the relative position of mean - field energy minima corresponding to different shapes .",
    "one therefore can not avoid to readjust the effective interactions in both the mean - field and pairing channels simultaneously and with the inclusion of correlations .",
    "obviously , these five steps are not completely independent .",
    "for instance , several previous studies have shown that the excitation energy of the first excited @xmath111 state is overestimated in spherical or near - spherical nuclei if only an axial quadrupole collective variable is considered .",
    "the variational space should probably enlarged in these cases by breaking the time - reversal invariance and introducing a cranking constraint .",
    "however , systematic studies with the present model are still required to determine which are the critical nuclei requiring an improved model .    from our study",
    ", one can also conclude that the absence of a wigner term affects strongly the description of light nuclei , with a border between light and heavy nuclei around mass 60 .",
    "the linear refit of the effective interaction using the c - norm has also put into evidence critical nuclei . a first way to continue",
    "this study could be to use the c - norm to establish a larger list of critical nuclei .",
    "this will require to extend the data included in the refit of the interactions in order to lift the redundancy of the effective interaction parameters .",
