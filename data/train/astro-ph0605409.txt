    "selfgravitating system are ubiquous in the universe .",
    "selfgravity governs the formation and evolution of the large scale structure in the universe as well as the dynamics of galaxy formation , stars and interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "it is therefore of great interest to study self - gravitating fluids in thermal equilibrium although most astrophysical and cosmological systems are not in exact thermal equilibrium @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the self - gravitating gas has peculiar properties from the point of view of equilibrium statistical mechanics : the most important configurations are inhomogeneous and the thermodynamic functions * exist * in the * dilute * limit @xcite @xmath2 where @xmath0 is the number of particles and @xmath3 stands for the volume of the box containing them . in such a limit , the internal energy , the free energy and the entropy turns to be extensive .",
    "that is , they take the form of @xmath4 times a function of intensive dimensionless variables . in the case of a spherical box of radius @xmath5",
    "( so that @xmath6 ) there is only one such variable , that is the ratio of the characteristic gravitational energy @xmath7 ( @xmath8 is the particle mass and @xmath9 is newton s constant ) and the kinetic energy of the order of the temperature @xmath10 of a particle in the gas @xcite : @xmath11 for more complex geometries there will be , besides @xmath12 ( in such cases @xmath5 is to be identified with the linear scale of the box ) , other dimensionless shape parameters .    in this paper",
    "we restrict the analysis to the simplest case of a spherical box and follow the approach of refs.@xcite where the starting point is the partition function for non - relativistic particles interacting through their gravitational attraction in thermal equilibrium .",
    "the configurational part of this partition function is expressed as a functional integral over a scalar field @xmath13 [ proportional to the the gravitational potential ] with an euclidean action ( that is minus the logarithm of statistical weight ) proportional to @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the saddle point technique ( or mean field method ) permits to compute the configuration partition function in the large @xmath4 limit .    as investigated in refs.@xcite the self - gravitating gas in the canonical ensemble",
    "is in a gaseous phase for @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "( further studies on self - gravitating gases are reported in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . at this point",
    "the isothermal compressibility diverges and the speed of sound inside the sphere becomes imaginary .",
    "this clearly shows that the gas phase collapses at this point in the canonical ensemble as a consequence of the jeans instability .",
    "monte carlo simulations explicitly show that the gas collapses for @xmath16 into a very dense and compact phase@xcite .",
    "it must be recalled that the small fluctuations around the mean field solution in the canonical ensemble are stable for @xmath17@xcite .",
    "namely , fluctuations in the partition function do not feel the divergence of the isothermal compressibility neither the fact that the speed of sound becomes imaginary .",
    "even in the regime where the gaseous phase is locally stable there are always collapsed configurations which have much lower energy than the gas .",
    "in fact , the energy has its absolute minimum in the collapsed phase where all particles fall to one point and this configuration completely dominates the free energy , causing its divergence to minus infinity .",
    "of course , interactions other than gravitational always dominate for short distances .",
    "therefore , the properties the collapsed phase depend on the short distance physics .",
    "this physics is different according to the nature of the ` particles ' considered . they can be from galaxies till molecules or atoms .",
    "still , we can study the regime when collapse happens just introducing a short distance cutoff ( ultraviolet regulator ) to the gravitational interaction .",
    "we present a complete description of the self - gravitating gas , including the collapsed phase , using a newtonian potential regularized at short distances .",
    "we choose the newton potential to be @xmath18 for interparticle distances @xmath19 instead of newton s law @xmath20 .",
    "the cutoff @xmath21 is chosen very small compared with the size of the box .",
    "we give an exact mapping of the @xmath0-body regularized problem into a field theory functional integral .",
    "this functional integral is dominated by its saddle points in the @xmath1 , namely by the mean field equations .",
    "the mean field equations coincide for zero cutoff with the lane - emden equation obtained from hydrostatics and assuming an ideal gas equation of state .    in this way",
    "we reproduce the well - known isothermal sphere solutions describing a self - gravitating gas in local thermal equilibrium .",
    "these diluted solutions get small corrections for small cutoff .",
    "we find a host of new solutions ( saddle points ) from our regularized mean field equations .",
    "these new solutions are singular in the limit of zero cutoff and can not be find from the standard ( no cutoff ) lane - emden equation . in these new solutions , which are perfectly regular for non - zero cutoff , a large number of particles concentrate near the origin .",
    "there are two new types of solutions .",
    "the first type are the collapsed saddle point solutions : all the particles are densely concentrated in a region of size of the order of the cutoff .",
    "these solutions are studied analytically and provide the absolute minima of the free energy , which reads , at dominant order for small cutoff @xmath22 : @xmath23 here , @xmath10 is the temperature and @xmath24 is the free energy of an ideal gas .",
    "the first term is just the potential energy of @xmath4 particles clustered in a small sphere of radius @xmath25 , where the regularized gravitational interaction is the same for all @xmath26 particle pairs .",
    "the second term is @xmath10 times the entropy loss in the collapse .",
    "this free energy is large and negative , unbounded from below as @xmath27 . in particular , this free energy is well below the free energy of the dilute solution .",
    "the second type of saddle point solutions interpolate between the gas phase and the collapsed phase , in a sort of pre  collapse .",
    "this solution has a finite action in the zero cutoff limit and describes the tunneling transition where a small fraction of particles coalesce into a region of the size of the short  distance regulator so that the density near the origin is very large .",
    "the tunneling probability to collapse for a dilute solution turns out to be extremely small for large @xmath0 and small @xmath28 .",
    "this means in practice that dilute solutions which are locally stable can be considered stable . as mentioned above this",
    "happens in the canonical ensemble for @xmath14 where @xmath15 .",
    "the parameter @xmath29 for the collapsed solutions can be arbitrarily large .",
    "that is , the particle density does not need to be dilute @xmath30 [ see eq.([limter ] ) ] but we can have @xmath31 .",
    "we obtain in sec .",
    "[ metab ] an estimate for the lifetime for the dilute phase of the self - gravitating gas : @xmath32 \\ ; .\\ ] ] one can see that the lifetime becomes infinitely long in the zero cutoff limit as well as when @xmath33 at fixed cutoff [ recall that @xmath34 in the dilute limit of eq .",
    "( [ limter ] ) ] .    in summary , we provide through mean field theory a complete statistical description of the self - gravitating gas including the absolute minimum of the free energy .",
    "at short distances , the particle interaction for the self - gravitating gas in physical situations is not gravitational .",
    "its exact nature depends on the problem under consideration ( opacity limit , van der waals forces for molecules etc . ) .",
    "we shall just assume a null short  distance pair force ; that is , we consider the hamiltonian @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath22 is the short  distance cut - off .",
    "it must be stressed that the results presented in this work using the soft - core cut - off eq.([defva ] ) will be qualitatively the same for other types of cut - off since @xmath37 .",
    "the partition function in the canonical ensemble reads @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the temperature .",

    "thus , @xmath44 is the full canonical free energy .    we can now replace the integration over the particle coordinates with a functional integration over the configurations of the gravitational field @xmath45 produced by the particles .",
    "we start from the fundamental property of gaussian functional integrals , namely @xmath46 + \\int d^3x\\ ,    j({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}})\\,\\varphi({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}})\\right\\ } = \\exp\\left[\\frac12\\int d^3x    \\int d^3x'\\,j({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}})\\ ; { \\cal g}({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}},{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}')\\ ; j({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}')\\right ] \\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath47 $ ] is the quadratic action functional @xmath48 = \\frac12\\int d^3x\\int d^3x'\\ ; \\varphi({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}})\\ ,    { \\cal g}^{-1}({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}},{{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}')\\ , \\varphi({{{\\boldsymbol{x}}}}')\\ ] ] and the integration measure is assumed to be normalized such that @xmath49\\}=1 $ ]",
