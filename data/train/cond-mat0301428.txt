    "the study of quantum dynamics of hydrogen molecules in confined geometries has recently developed into an active field both experimentally and theoretically@xcite due to potential use as catalysts , molecular sieves , and storage media . in the case of fullerenes and nanotubes ,",
    "such trapping may yield new exotic quantum systems due to zero and one dimensionality of the absorption sites , respectively .",
    "thus , understanding the structural and dynamical aspects of trapping in confining geometries is of both fundamental and practical importance .",
    "the theory of molecular rotation in solids has a long history dating back to the early work of pauling@xcite , devonshire@xcite , and cundy@xcite .",
    "they introduced the concept of the crystal field potential , @xmath5 , where @xmath6 specifies the orientation of the molecule , to solve for the energy levels of the hindered rigid - rotor .",
    "this traditional approach assumes that the center of mass ( cm ) of the trapped molecules are fixed and therefore does not take into account the rotation - vibration ( rv ) coupling .",
    "however recent studies@xcite have indicated that vibrational levels of h@xmath0 trapped in the octahedral sites of c@xmath7 , for example , are significantly perturbed by rv coupling and in a previous paper@xcite ( i ) we have shown that this coupling has to be included in a symmetry analysis of the energy level degeneracies .",
    "interestingly , to date there is a little done to treat cm dynamics and rv coupling .",
    "most of the studies are based on the approximation where an effective orientational crystal field potential is obtained after the potential is averaged over the zero - point translational motions of the h@xmath0 molecule@xcite .",
    "recently ( in i ) we have presented a detailed theory of coupled rv dynamics of h@xmath0 molecule trapped in a zero dimensional cavity with various symmetries . here",
    "we present a similar study to analyze the combined rotational and translation states of hydrogen molecules confined in a one dimensional potential .",
    "this problem is closely related to the experimental situation where hydrogen molecules are absorbed into carbon nanotube ropes .",
    "figure  1 shows schematically various types of absorption sites for h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "several neutron and raman scattering experiments have been carried out to characterize the binding energies and rotational barriers for h@xmath0 at these sites with conflicting results@xcite .",
    "one of the motivations of the present work is to provide a detailed description of the rv dynamics of h@xmath0 molecules at these different absorption sites and discuss the consequences for inelastic neutron scattering experiments . in the present paper ,",
    "we focus our attention on the general formalism and discuss only the case where a single h@xmath0 is confined inside a single nanotube .",
    "extension of this work to the interstitial and external sites and to cases where h@xmath8 molecules interact with one another will be presented elsewhere .",
    "briefly this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    ", we discuss the potential model for hydrogen and nanotube interactions and validate several approximations , such as assuming a smooth tube , used in our formalism . in sec .",
    "iii we present our formalism to treat the coupled rotational and translational motion of h@xmath0 molecule confined in a smooth nanotube .",
    "we show that the problem can be mapped into a ( @xmath1)-component radial schrodinger equation which can be solved numerically . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the dynamics of a hydrogen molecule when the confining potential has parabolic shape ( which occurs for a small - radius nanotube ) .",
    "we interpret the exact numerical results in terms of a simple analytical toy model . in sec .",
    "v we discuss the case where the confining potential has a mexican - hat shape . for this case ( which occurs for large radius nanotubes such as ( 10,10 ) ) the equilibrium position of the cm of the h@xmath0 molecule is off - center and it performs radial and tangential translational oscillation in combination with its rotational dynamics . in this section , we also present several perturbation results which help to interpret the exact numerical results . in sec.vi",
    "we discuss the experimental observation of various transitions via inelastic neutron scattering measurements .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in sec.vii .",
    "we model the intermolecular potential for h@xmath0 trapped in a carbon nanotube as a sum of atom - atom potentials    @xmath9    the dependence of the potential on the position ( @xmath10 ) and orientation ( @xmath6 ) of h@xmath0 molecule is through the inter - atomic distances @xmath11 .",
    "all the results reported in this paper are obtained from the same ws77 potential,@xcite @xmath12 , ( where @xmath13 ev , and @xmath14 ) , that we used in i@xcite .",
    "compared to other commonly used potentials , the ws77 potential gave the best fit to the energy spectrum of h@xmath0 in solid c@xmath15 .    for simplicity we will restrict this formulation to the idealized case when the hydrogen molecule is confined by a so - called  smooth \" nanotube .",
    "by this we mean that the potential produced by the nanotube has cylindrical symmetry and is invariant with respect to translations along its axis of symmetry .",
    "in some of our numerical work we will study `` real '' nanotubes which do not posses the high symmetry of `` smooth '' nanotubes .",
    "it is instructive to look at various potentials for an orientationally averaged hydrogen molecule ( i.e. para hydrogen with @xmath16 ) when h@xmath0 is inside and outside a single nanotube .",
    "figure  2 indicates two different types of confining potential depending on the nanotube radius .",
    "figure  2a shows that for small nanotubes such as ( 9,0 ) , the potential minimum occurs at the center of the tube and therefore the potential has a parabolic shape .",
    "however for larger nanotubes such as ( 10,10 ) nanotube , the minimum is off - centered and therefore the potential has a mexican - hat shape . because of this off - centering the dynamics of the h@xmath0 molecule is a quite interesting and rich one as we discuss in detail below .",
    "the right panels in fig .",
    "2 shows the potential when the h@xmath0 molecule is outside the nanotubes .",
    "the outside binding energy does not depend on the tube radius strongly and is about 30 mev .",
    "the horizontal lines indicates the radial phonon energy levels , indicating that at least a few bound states can occur even for a hydrogen molecule outside a single nanotube .",
    "the solid and dashed lines in fig .",
    "2 shows the results with and without the smooth tube approximation , respectively .",
    "since these two curves are very close to one another , the smooth tube approximation will not cause significant error in our theory .    in order to develop some intuition about the orientational potential for a hydrogen molecule in a nanotube , in fig .",
    "3a we show the radial potential for three different orientations of h@xmath0 molecule inside a ( 10,10 ) nanotube .",
    "we note that the radius of the ( 10,10 ) tube is large enough that the parallel to the axis ( p ) and tangential ( t ) orientations ( as depicted in the inset to fig .  3a ) give almost the same energy .",
    "however , the radial ( r ) orientation of a h@xmath0 molecule has a minimum energy which is about 8 mev higher in energy than that of the other two orientations .",
    "we also point out that the position of the cm of the h@xmath8 molecule for the minimum potential energy changes about 0.2 @xmath17 depending on the orientation of the h@xmath0 molecule .",
    "this is a clear indication that the orientational and vibrational motion of hydrogen molecule are significantly coupled .",
    "figure  3b shows the minimum potential energies , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 for respective radial , parallel , and tangential orientations of an h@xmath0 molecule inside various nanotubes .",
    "it is clear that for nanotube radius around 3@xmath20 , the orientational dependence of the potential is of the order of 30 mev and therefore is comparable to the energy separation of 80 mev or more between energy levels corresponding to different rotational quantum number @xmath2 s .",
    "accordingly , for tubes whose radius is less than that of a ( 9,0 ) tube , @xmath2 may not be considered to be a good quantum number . for large nanotubes , such as ( 10,10 ) , the orientational potential is of the order of 8 mev and does not change much with larger radius tubes ( i.e. close to the graphite limit ) . in the present paper , we present our formalism using ( 9,0 ) and ( 10,10 ) nanotubes which represent the two potential regimes ; namely the parabolic and mexican - hat potentials , but for both tubes @xmath2 is considered to be a good quantum number .",
    "the hydrogen molecule is unique in that its moment of inertia is small enough that the rotational kinetic energy often dominates the orientational potential in which the molecule is placed . under these circumstances",
    "the rotational quantum number @xmath2 is nearly a good quantum number and the effect of the orientational potential is to reduce the degeneracy of the @xmath1 sub - states of a given @xmath2 .",
    "( the generalization of the formulation we present below to the case when @xmath2 is not a good quantum number will be presented elsewhere@xcite ) . in the present case",
    "any eigenfunction describing the orientational and translation state of the molecule can be written in the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are the cylindrical coordinates of the center - of - mass of the hydrogen molecule , @xmath6 denotes its molecular orientation specified by angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and @xmath27 is a spherical harmonic .",
    "we will refer to @xmath28 as the cylindrical rv wavefunction . for economy of notation",
    "we henceforth omit the superscripts @xmath2 and @xmath29 .",
    "because @xmath30 is allowed to depend arbitrarily on @xmath22 and @xmath24 , this wave function takes into account the most general interaction between rotations and translations subject to the constraint that @xmath2 is a good quantum number . in this notation ,",
    "the hamiltonian for a single hydrogen molecule ( of mass @xmath31 ) with @xmath2 and @xmath29 fixed is written as @xmath32 where @xmath31 is the mass of an h@xmath8 molecule and @xmath33 is the orientational potential which , as indicated , also depends on position . for a smooth nanotube we may write the orientational potential energy as @xmath34 where the sum is over @xmath35 . because the hydrogen molecule is centrosymmetric , only terms with @xmath36 even appear in the potential . also , because a smooth nanotube has a mirror plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry , only terms with even @xmath37 appear .",
    "furthermore , because a global rotation of the molecule ( i. e. incrementing both @xmath26 and @xmath24 by the same amount ) is a symmetry of the system , we may write @xmath38 where @xmath39 is a function only of @xmath22 and @xmath40 .",
    "in addition , @xmath41 vanishes for @xmath42 .",
    "there is also a mirror plane containing the long axis of the tube which implies that the potential should be an even function of @xmath43 .",
    "this implies that @xmath44 is a real - valued function",
    ". this function may be evaluated by integrating the potential at a fixed center - of - mass position over all orientations : @xmath45 contrary to appearance , @xmath44 does not depend on @xmath24 because @xmath33 is a function of @xmath43 .",
    "the schrodinger equation for @xmath28 is @xmath46 \\psi^{(\\alpha ) } ( r , \\phi_r ; \\omega ) \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\ \\ = \\hat e^{(\\alpha ) }   \\psi^{(\\alpha ) } ( r , \\phi_r ; \\omega ) \\ , \\label{scheq } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 . for given values of @xmath2 and @xmath29",
    ", this equation generates a spectrum of eigenvectors @xmath48 with associated eigenvalues @xmath49 , for @xmath50 . substituting eq .",
    "( [ psieq ] ) into the schrodinger equation we rewrite it in the form @xmath51 we see that we may write a solution to this set of equations in the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a quantum number whose significance we will discuss shortly .",
    "thus we have @xmath54 for each @xmath53 index we have a schrodinger equation for the @xmath55-component wave function which is of the form @xmath56 $ ] . then the cylindrical rv wavefunction is @xmath57 it is important to keep in mind that @xmath44 vanishes for odd @xmath37 . as a consequence , in the @xmath55-component wavefunction",
    "there is no mixing between even and odd values of @xmath37 . for @xmath58 wavefunctions",
    "one will have `` even ''",
    "wavefunctions in which the sum over @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ peq ] ) reduces to the single term for @xmath59 and `` odd '' wavefunctions in which the sum over @xmath37 in eq .",
    "( [ peq ] ) includes only @xmath60 .",
    "the quantum number @xmath53 indicates that this wavefunction transforms like @xmath61 when the position and orientation of the molecule are simultaneously rotated about the axis of symmetry . under this global rotation the quantity @xmath62 is invariant , so the total wavefunction transforms as stated .",
    "when @xmath44 is independent of @xmath22 , then , since @xmath41 must vanish , we have that @xmath63 for @xmath42 and , in eq ( [ eqn ] ) there is no coupling between @xmath64 s for different values of @xmath37 .",
    "thus , in this case there is no dynamical interaction between the orientational coordinate and the center - of - mass coordinate and the wave function can be chosen so that @xmath65 is only nonzero for a single value of @xmath37 .",
    "then one has the usual separation of variables so that the orientational wave function is proportional to @xmath66 and the translation wave function is proportional to @xmath67 .",
    "here we have accomplished a similar separation of coordinates when @xmath68 is allowed to depend on @xmath22 .",
    "now the result is not a scalar radial equation , but rather a radial equation for a @xmath55-component wave function .",
    "that is the result embodied in eq .",
    "( [ eqn ] ) , where we have one such @xmath55-component radial schrodinger equation for each value of @xmath53 .",
    "in this section we discuss the case exemplified by a h@xmath8 molecule inside a @xmath69 nanotube , for which the minimum of the potential @xmath70 occurs for @xmath71 , in which case we will introduce a toy model with the isotropic harmonic potential @xmath72 .        here",
    "we discuss the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the two - dimensional isotropic harmonic oscillator , to emphasize the relation between the above formulation in terms of cylindrical coordinates and that in terms of cartesian coordinates .    for an isotropic and harmonic potential",
    "we expect the eigenvalues to be @xmath73 note that the @xmath74th level ( with energy @xmath75 ) is @xmath74-fold degenerate , because in cartesian notation , if , say @xmath76 , we have wave functions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is a wave function with @xmath74 excitations in the @xmath82 coordinate and @xmath31 excitations in the @xmath83 coordinate .",
    "this degeneracy reflects the @xmath84 symmetry corresponding to the invariance of the hamiltonian with respect to a transformation of the form @xmath85   \\left ( \\begin{array } { c } ( a_x^\\dagger ) \\\\ ( a_y^\\dagger ) \\\\",

    "this transformation is essentially the same as a four dimensional rotational symmetry in the space of the momenta @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and coordinates @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "since the kinetic energy is quadratic in the momenta , spherical symmetry in this space only holds if the potential is harmonic .    in cylindrical coordinates the eigenfunctions can be written as @xmath91 where @xmath92 satisfies the radial equation , @xmath93 + \\frac{1}{2 } k r^2 \\psi^\\alpha_\\mu(r ) = e^\\alpha_\\mu \\psi^\\alpha_\\mu(r ) \\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the family of solutions for a given value of @xmath94 are labeled @xmath95 in order of increasing energy and for the isotropic and harmonic potential we have @xmath96 so from the radial equation for @xmath97 we have eigenvalues @xmath98 , @xmath99 , @xmath100 , etc .",
    "the fact that we have a seemingly accidental degeneracy between different representations ( i. e. between different values of @xmath94 ) is the result of the u2 symmetry of the hamiltonian mentioned above .",
    "a consequence of this symmetry is that for a harmonic potential the total energy depends only on the total number of phonon excitations .",
    "this symmetry is distinct from the circular symmetry in @xmath82-@xmath83 space .",
    "the u2 symmetry is broken by anharmonic terms which then take us into the generic case of a particle in a circularly symmetric potential which is not harmonic .",
    "accordingly , we now consider the effect of adding an anharmonic perturbation of the form @xmath101 to the harmonic potential .",
    "for illustrative purposes , we treat this anharmonic perturbation within first - order perturbation theory .",
    "our results are characteristic of the generic case , for which different values of @xmath31 give rise to distinct eigenvalues . in this case , the @xmath74-fold degenerate manifold which has energy @xmath102 for the harmonic potential is split into doublets ( corresponding to the degeneracy between @xmath103 and @xmath104 ) and , if @xmath74 is odd , a singlet from @xmath105 .",
    "our explicit results are given in table i. these results are generic in the sense that addition of further anharmonic terms will not further change the degeneracies .",
    "in this section we explore the consequences of allowing coupling between rotations and translations . since we now restrict attention to the manifold of @xmath106 , we need keep only terms with @xmath107 in eq .",

    "however , we emphasize that in our numerical work@xcite , we do not make this approximation . equation ( [ eqn ] ) assumes that @xmath2 is a good quantum number but mixes states with different numbers of phonon excitations .",
    "we should mention that the toy model assumes that the molecule has minimal potential energy when it on the axis of the tube . for small [ e. g. ( 9,0 ) tubes ] this assumption is justified . for larger tubes ,",
    "the minimal potential energy occurs for a nonzero value of @xmath22 and the molecule is dominantly off center .",
    "we will later treat that case using a different model .",
    "we now discuss the results of the toy model assuming that the number of phonons is a good quantum number .",

    "one may visualize this as the energy difference between a state for which the molecule is in the phonon ground state and is oriented parallel to the axis and the two states when the molecule is in the phonon ground state and is oriented transversely to the axis .",
