    "the main purpose of this work is to prove that billiard invisibility is impossible in an infinite number of directions in a class of bounded two - dimensional bodies with a piecewise smooth boundary .",
    "we consider such a body ( set ) and the billiard in the complement of this set .",
    "invisibility in a direction means that almost all billiard particles that initially move in this direction and hit the body , after several reflections from the body s boundary are eventually redirected to the same trajectory , so the initial and final ( infinite ) intervals of this trajectory lie on the same straight line .",
    "even though research on invisibility is flourishing , and impressive progress has been made in the design of metamaterials ( artificial materials engineered to bend electromagnetic waves around a concealed object ) , until very recently invisibility in mirror optics was largely overlooked both in engineering and mathematics .",
    "we refer the reader to our paper @xcite for a brief overview of recent developments in the field and historical background .",
    "the focus of this note is solely on the mathematical aspects of billiard invisibility .",
    "we showed earlier that it is impossible to construct a body invisible in _ all _ directions .",
    "this work serves to lower the known upper bound on the number of directions of invisibility : in the two - dimensional case for piecewise smooth bodies it is now reduced from ` less than all ' to ` at most finite number ' of directions .",
    "earlier there have been constructed 2d and 3d bodies invisible in 1 direction @xcite and from 1 point @xcite .",
    "it is unknown if these results can be improved .",
    "there have been also designed infinitely connected sets invisible in 2 directions ( in 2d case ) and in 3 directions ( in 3d case ) ; notice however that these sets do not have piecewise smooth boundary and therefore do not satisfy the assumptions we impose in this paper .    in a somewhat different development burdzy and kulczycki",
    "@xcite showed that it is possible to construct a body that is almost invisible in almost all directions with a given arbitrarily small accuracy .",
    "the body they constructed is the finite union of disjoint line segments contained in the unit circle , and its projection on most directions is close to the corresponding projection of the circle . here",
    "` most ' and ` close ' mean : up to a set of arbitrarily small measure .",
    "our paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : main ] we go over basic definitions and state our main result , then prove it in section  [ sec : proof ] .",

    "that is , each function @xmath2 \\to { { \\mathbb{r}}}^2 $ ] is of class @xmath3 ( this implies that there exist the lateral derivatives of @xmath4 at @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) ; @xmath7 for all @xmath8 $ ] ; @xmath9 for @xmath10 implies @xmath11 ; and for @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",

    "whose boundary @xmath19 is a piecewise smooth 1d set , is called _ a body_. _ regular _ and _ singular _ points of the body s boundary are determined in agreement with definition [ o piecewise smooth ] .",

    "besides , the velocity @xmath28 of the particle is a piecewise constant function taking values in @xmath29 .",
    "the values @xmath30 are called _ the initial data _ and @xmath31 , @xmath32 _ the final data _ of the motion .",
    "the final data are functions of the initial ones , @xmath33 , @xmath34 .",
    "these functions are continuous and defined on an open subset of @xmath35 .",
    "each regular billiard motion is uniquely defined by its initial data ( and also by its final data ) .",
    "[ r initial data]if @xmath36 is parallel to @xmath37 then the two motions with the initial data @xmath38 and @xmath39 can be obtained one from the other by a shift along @xmath40 ( and therefore the corresponding trajectories @xmath41 and @xmath42 coincide ) .",
    "therefore the billiard motion is well defined even if @xmath43 is contained in @xmath21 ( see fig .",

    "[ fig conv ] ) .",
    "obviously , @xmath79 .",
    "note that the same motion is also a regular motion in @xmath20 , and so by lemma [ l0 regtraj ] , @xmath21 is not invisible in the direction @xmath66 .",

    "this fact allows one to sharpen the previous inequality , @xmath92 this also implies that in the coordinate system with the @xmath43-axis parallel to @xmath52 and the @xmath93-axis parallel to @xmath50 , the curves @xmath4 containing @xmath60 can be locally ( in a small strip @xmath94 ) represented by graphs of functions . moreover",
    ", these functions form a finite monotone sequence .",

    "assume that ( i ) holds ( the case ( ii ) is considered in a similar way ) .",
    "by our convention , the maximum is achieved for @xmath95 , therefore @xmath102 then for all @xmath43 with @xmath103 positive and sufficiently small , the motion with the initial data @xmath30 has ( within the strip ) a single reflection at a point @xmath104 of the curve @xmath95 . besides , the velocity @xmath105 after the reflection is close to @xmath106 which means that @xmath107 .",
    "one easily sees that @xmath108 ; indeed , @xmath109 it follows that @xmath110 .",
    "if @xmath103 is positive and sufficiently small then each ray @xmath111 with the vertex at @xmath104 and @xmath112 , @xmath113 is entirely contained in the set @xmath114 ( the set bounded by and to the right of the broken line @xmath115 in fig . [ fig single ] ) .",
    "this implies that each particle with the corresponding initial data @xmath30 makes a single reflection from @xmath95 and then moves freely forever .",
    "indeed , the further motion is in @xmath116 , which is the union of the strip @xmath94 and the set @xmath117 ( exterior of the angle ) .",
    "there are no further reflections inside the strip , and no point of reflection can belong to @xmath117 ( since @xmath118 ) .",
    "it remains to note that @xmath119 and therefore @xmath120 .",
    "we come to a contradiction with lemma [ l0 regtraj ] , which states that @xmath21 is not invisible in the direction @xmath37 .",
    "the following corollary of lemma [ l2 2points ] is obvious .",
