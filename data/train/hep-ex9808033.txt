    "the difficulties of creating effective detectors for solar neutrino research are well known involving , in varying degree , radioactive backgrounds in the target and its surroundings , extraction of signal from massive targets , energy resolution and choices of detection reaction mechanisms . as lower",
    "energy neutrinos are to be detected , most of these difficulties increase or choices are narrowed especially for real - time detectors , although the higher flux ameliorates somewhat the massiveness of the targets .",
    "as the field of solar neutrino research has matured and moves toward its goal of achieving a measurement of the shape and neutrino - flavor composition of the flux over the full spectrum , the need for a  third generation \" of detectors able to carry out detailed experiments in the region from a few kev to @xmath1 mev has been apparent .",
    "this is the region containing the p - p and cno continuum as well as the @xmath0be and p - e - p lines . from the  first generation \" radiochemical experiments ( homestake , gallex and sage ) @xcite we already know some important things about this energy region .",
    "for example , that the integrated fluxes of @xmath2 are @xmath3 of those expected from the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite and that , when taken together in a global analysis of all solar experiments , suggest that the @xmath0be @xmath2 flux may be much diminished . from the present status",
    "it is not possible to know how this flux reduction is shared among the different contributing fusion reactions nor whether there are neutrino flavors other then @xmath2 present .",
    "the upcoming ,  second generation \" borexino @xcite liquid scintillator experiment will directly address the @xmath0be question in real - time via the ( nearly ) flavor - independent elastic scattering reaction on electrons .",
    "this represents an important next step ; however , many questions will still remain , among them whether or not the full p - p flux is seen as @xmath2 , to what extent is the cno flux affected , what is the flavor composition of the flux at all energies and whether the p - e - p and @xmath0be lines can be resolved .",
    "the experimental technology to attack these questions in this energy regime has not existed but in recent years there have emerged  and there are still emerging  some new approaches in various stages of research and development which are showing significant promise .",
    "no single technique is likely to emerge which will be able to address all questions in a single detector and the diversity of the projects i will discuss reflect choices , on the experimenters part , to focus on the different physics opportunities . in this talk i will try more strongly to emphasize how some of these new techniques work , some of their recent r & d results , what still needs to be done and what their physics foci are rather than what a finished detector might look like . by and large they are still r & d projects and",
    "have not yet shown full feasibility for implementation as a neutrino detector .",
    "some of the projects are known explicitly by their target material such as lithium or gallium arsenide and others with the target identity subsumed into acronyms such as heron , hellaz , lencse and gno .",
    "these projects , heron and hellaz , are both based upon the use of helium as the target medium but they have radically different approaches and somewhat complementary goals .",
    "both will utilize the elastic reaction , @xmath4 , for real - time detection in the energy region dominated by the p - p and @xmath0be neutrinos .",
    "they will both measure the energy of the recoil electron and the overall rate . the similarities and contrasting differences are best seen by looking at the specifics of each project in turn .",
    "this project uses @xmath5he in its superfluid state @xcite and is a new particle detection technique . for purity from radioactivity ,",
    "superfluid helium @xmath5he is ideal for several reasons .",
    "it has no long - lived isotopes , its first excited nuclear state is at 20 mev , it is self - cleaning in that all other atomic species freeze out and @xmath6he ( which has a large neutron cross section ) is easily reduced to negligible amounts in the superfluid during the detector filling .",
    "it has a high density of 0.14 g / cc , it is inexpensive and standard commercial methods exist for handling the liquid in large volumes . the mechanism for event identification and energy extraction from the target utilizes the high multiplicity of carriers ( @xmath7 rotons / phonons and @xmath8 uv photons for a 50 kev @xmath9 ) generated in the liquid by the recoil .",
    "an array of low mass silicon or sapphire wafer calorimeters external to the liquid serve to detect pulses created by the direct uv photons as well as the delayed pulse generated by the rotons / phonons through quantum evaporation at the free surface .",
    "event position in the detector would be found by observing the spatial distribution of hit wafers and relative times of arrival of the photon and evaporated atom pulses .",
    "the recoil electron energy would be found by the total pulse height on all hit wafers .",
    "backgrounds are primarily compton electrons from residual activity in the cryostat external to the liquid and would be subtracted by topological cuts and reference to fiducial and non - fiducial volumes .",
    "a detector large enough to detect 18 p - p and 7 @xmath0be events / day ( ssm ) would have 10 tons of helium in its fiducial volume and measure @xmath105x5x5 meters overall .",
    "there would be @xmath11 wafer readout channels and both liquid and wafers held at 30mk .",
    "refrigeration on this scale is commensurate with that for cryogenic gravity wave detectors .",
    "+ through earlier experiments detecting 3 to 5 mev alpha particles the group had established the validity of the basic physics principles of the particle detection method in superfluid helium combined with the use of wafer calorimeters . among other things",
    "it was seen that both the prompt uv photons and delayed roton / phonon evaporation signal were easily detected on the same silicon or sapphire wafer .",
    "many of the details of the evaporation process were established including the existence of the so - called critical angle ( @xmath12 for alphas ) within which rotons / phonons were able to initiate evaporation .",
    "it was expected that this critical angle could play a useful role in event position location .",
    "nonetheless , it still needed to be established that low energy electrons could also be detected and with what roton and photon characteristics .",
    "improvements in wafer sensitivity by adoption of superconducting thin film thermometers and squid technology have been made to do this .",
    "a threshold of 300 ev was reached for energy deposition into an individual wafer . in a recent series of experiments , 364 kev single , mono - energetic electrons ( from @xmath13sn radioactive sources movable in the test cell )",
    "have been successfully detected in 3 liters of superfluid .",
    "the measured spectrum is shown in figure [ spectrum_fig ] ; the peak at 31 kev is for the electron in this particular experimental geometry . for calibration purposes x - rays of 5.9 and 25 kev from @xmath14fe and @xmath13sn sources ,",
    "respectively , are deposited directly into the wafer and can also be seen .",
    "sn in superfluid @xmath5he .",
    "( inset : pulse for single , 364 kev electron with structure due to early arrival of uv photons . ]    as the electron source is moved horizontally below a single wafer the effect of the critical angle can be seen ( figure [ angle_fig ] ) in the position dependence of the combined evaporation and photon signal and suggests a larger critical angle ( @xmath15 ) for the electrons .",
    "particular attention was paid to studying the total amount of energy detectable and the resulting partition of that energy between the evaporation signal and the uv photon signal . in the inset of figure [ spectrum_fig ]",
    ", the leading edge shows the prompt photon signal followed 250 @xmath16s later by the evaporation signal .",
    "while both alphas and electrons yield roughly the same total energy fraction ( @xmath17 ) they share that energy quite differently between uv radiation and evaporation .",
    "the electron signal relative to the alphas is nearly 3 times that in the uv photons and about @xmath18 for the evaporation pulse .",
    "this corresponds , for an electron , to 14 photons / kev and 2x10@xmath19 ( rotons / phonons)/kev .",
    "the uv photons have a wavelength of @xmath20 nm ; a wavelength for which helium is self - transparent .",
    "the group believes it has completed its study of the physics processes underlying the proposed particle detection technique and has a good understanding of the mechanisms involved .",
    "the results are consistent with a microscopic model in which the initial ionization density along the track governs the rate of formation and collision relaxation of helium dimers and therefore the relative portions of energy detectable as rotons / phonons and uv photons .",
    "+ among the future work toward demonstrating feasibility for solar neutrino detection are several items .",
    "foremost is the need to improve the sensitivity of the wafers for use in large volumes by a factor @xmath21 .",
    "this is closely related , in part , to trying to capitalize on the increased uv radiation found to be emitted by the low energy electrons and incorporating it most effectively with the evaporation signal . a particularly promising avenue being pursued for increased sensitivity",
    "is based on incorporating new developments in magnetic calorimetry .",
    "further work with superconducting thin film thermometers is also in progress .",
    "a multi - wafer cell is under development to test various features of energy and position determination as well as implementation of cryogenics for such a system .",
    "this project @xcite will utilize helium ( mixed with @xmath22 ch@xmath23 ) in gaseous form under pressure and reduced temperature ( 5 atmos .",
    "and 77k ) yielding a 0.003 g / cc density .",
    "it seeks to use an existing particle detection technique and scale it up in size ( 2000 @xmath24 ) and into the high pressure and low temperature regime .",
    "the mechanism for event identification and energy extraction makes use of the drift of the ionization electrons ( @xmath104x10@xmath25 for 100 kev recoil @xmath9 ) in a large time projection chamber ( tpc ) .",
    "the event signature consists of full @xmath9 recoil track reconstruction .",
    "the recoil energy is to be determined by counting individual secondary , ionization electrons as they drift to the x - y imaging plane .",
    "use of the first arriving secondary electron to set a @xmath26 and the time delays of the subsequent secondaries on the earliest part of the track should allow determination of the track orientation in the tpc .",
    "detection of the bragg peak should distinguish front from rear track end .",
    "combination of this information with the contemporaneous position of the sun would be used to deduce the energy of the incident neutrino .",
    "backgrounds here are of two types : a ) compton electrons from the tpc and the pressure vessel and b ) from beta decay of @xmath27c in the gas mixture .",
    "backgrounds would be subtracted using a sample of events constructed assuming the sun to be located @xmath28 from its true position",
    ". a detector of 6 tons would be expected to yield 11 p - p and 4 @xmath0be events / day ( ssm ) ; it would be 25 meters long and 10 meters in diameter . with x - y detector planes at",
    "both ends the recoil electron track would be drifted up to 10 meters .",
    "if experimental hall dimensions require , it could in principle by split into two portions .",
    "+ in earlier work the group had extensively tested various gas mixtures to find one suitable for tpc operation under the conditions envisioned for the solar neutrino application .",
    "the he - ch@xmath29 mixture was selected as the most promising but it imposes severe requirements on the speed ( @xmath30 ns ) and gain ( @xmath31 ) needed in the x - y readout for single secondary electron counting which is to provide the energy and space orientation of the recoil track .",
    "however , recently they have made important progress on that front by testing a new wire chamber technology  the  micromegas \" @xcite chamber . in that test",
    "a small chamber was used which was filled with a 1 atmosphere helium and 6% isobutane mixture and constructed of fine mesh forming a 100 @xmath16 m gap above a one - dimensional strip read .",
    "an x - ray source of known strength produced single photoelectrons in the chamber .",
    "these were detected with a rise time of @xmath32 ns and a gain of 2x10@xmath33 .",
    "details of a single photoelectron pulse are shown in figure [ single_pulse_fig ] .",
    "the successful detection of two , successive photoelectrons separated by only 10 ns is illustrated in figure [ double_pulse_fig ] . + future work is planned on several fronts .",
    "of particular importance is the need to adapt this counting success to the large scale tpc environment : e.g. , extend to two dimensional capability , find a gas and operational compatibility with the track drift and manage the potential , large increase in readout channels .",
    "several ideas for achieving these points are under active consideration among them , incorporating an electrostatic lens to reduce the effective area of the 100 @xmath34 endcaps .",
    "nearing completion is a 5 liter tpc capable of 5 bar and 77k operation to be used in tests to produce and detect compton recoils from 511 gammas .",
    "they are also preparing to initiate tests for low activity materials as well as to carry out further monte carlo studies related to recognition of electron track direction and energy determination .",
    "a recent proposal @xcite has been made to utilize @xmath35yb in a real - time , liquid scintillator detector . by detecting @xmath2 through inverse beta decay",
    "it would serve as a complement to those detectors using the flavor independent elastic scattering from electrons .",
    "this project will be discussed in a separate presentation by dr .",
    "a new approach to counting the back - decay of atoms collected in radiochemical experiments is being carried out by two groups ( gno and lithium ) .",
    "although this new technology has not yet been perfected for use in an operating solar neutrino detector , the groups are making impressive progress .",
    "the idea is to replace the classical method of small proportional counters by cryogenic micro - calorimeters .",
    "micro - calorimeters are small ( few micro- or milli - gram ) crystals at milli - kelvin temperatures to which the extracted radioactive sample has been applied .",
    "because of the exceptionally low heat capacity of the calorimeter , and if @xmath36 coverage is achieved , then the auger electrons and x - rays following the electron capture decay are contained hermetically and a temperature pulse results .",
    "this is a technique which is developing rapidly in other areas ( e.g. , for x - ray astronomy , double beta decay or dark matter searches ) where resolutions less than 100 ev have been obtained .",
    "although the primary motivations for the two groups discussed here to employ the cryogenic method are somewhat different , the technique holds out promise in several areas important to both : lower thresholds , improved energy resolution , full energy deposit and increased counting efficiency . a particular challenge common to both experiments will be to devise a method which ensures that a fully efficient transfer of the precious sample , extracted from the chemical reactor , is made onto the micro - calorimeter crystal .      for some time",
    ", @xmath37li has attracted interest as a radiochemical target with special relevance for the p - e - p and cno neutrinos because the strength of the ground and first excited states can be accurately inferred from laboratory experiments @xcite .",
    "the reaction is @xmath2 + @xmath37li @xmath38 + @xmath37be with a threshold of 862 kev .",
    "a particular challenge to the realization of a lithium - based detector has been the counting of the electron capture decays ( @xmath39 = 53d ) of the extracted @xmath37be in which 90% go to the @xmath37li ground state but produce an auger electron of only 55 ev together with a 57 ev nuclear recoil and is therefore not amenable to the usual proportional counter methods .",
    "consequently , interest had centered on utilizing the decay to the first excited state by detecting the subsequent 474 kev gamma but , with only a 10% branching ratio , a 100 ton detector was required to achieve a rate of 0.5/day .",
    "presently , a joint russian - italian project @xcite has made interesting progress on two fronts : a ) first , by capitalizing on the use of the 90% channel by developing the micro - calorimeter method thus making conceivable a detector of only 10 tons and b ) second , by developing a large scale prototype for the lithium reactor itself to test the difficulties of the lithium handling and sample extraction .",
    "+ in tests using cryogenic micro - calorimeter techniques with accelerator produced samples of be and beo , they have detected @xmath37be decays via the summed energy deposited by the auger electron ( 55 ev ) and the recoiling nucleus ( 57 ev ) giving a well resolved peak at 112 ev with a 24 ev fwhm at @xmath20% efficiency ( figure [ be7_spec_fig ] ) .",
    "the microcalorimeter consisted of a 100x200x200 @xmath16 m ntd thermistor at 45mk glued to the few @xmath16 g sample .     and",
    "@xmath40 in micro - calorimeter . ]",
    "while further work along these lines is needed , this result seems to establish feasibility of the method . among the future projects are plans to study other be compounds for improved phonon coupling to the thermistor and minimization of delayed counting effects from quasi - particle trapping in the crystal ( see the peak at very low energies ) .",
    "+ the mechanical work on a prototype reactor vessel to hold 300 kg of liquid lithium has been completed at inr(troitsk ) . the principal r&d work to be carried out with the prototype are studies of the complete lithium handling method and the be extraction process into forms most suitable for the micro - calorimetry counting method . in order to carry out this important series of tests with the prototype ,",
    "funds are urgently needed to move it to another laboratory and to operate it there .",
    "funding has been applied for and a decision enabling them to go forward is awaited .",
    "the gallium neutrino observatory @xcite is designed to improve and extend the very successful gallium radiochemical technique .",
    "details of gno s goals and present operating status can be found in dr .",
    "kirsten s presentation .",
    "my emphasis here is on the potential , cryogenic innovations which may have broad application .",
    "the events to be counted in gno are the electron capture decays of @xmath41ge . in the recently completed gallex experiment ,",
    "70% of the contribution to the systematic error was from the energy acceptance window .",
    "consequently , the much improved energy resolution which the micro - calorimeters promise is one reason arguing for attempting to exploit them .",
    "another reason is the potential for increased counting efficiency ; the proportional counter efficiencies are typically 70% due to several factors including dead volume and missed x - rays .",
    "every improvement in efficiency allows a similar reduction in gallium mass for the same statistics . improved systematics and statistics",
    "are among the principle goals of gno .",
    "k - capture constitutes 88% of the decays ( @xmath42 each into the 10.37 kev auger electron or a 9.35 kev @xmath43 with a 1.12 kev @xmath9 and 5.3% into a 10.26 kev @xmath44 with a 0.11 kev @xmath9 ) .",
    "the l - capture is 10.3% of the rate giving only a 1.30 kev auger electron .",
    "hermetic detection of the x - ray would prevent the  contamination \" of the l - peak by missed @xmath43 x - rays .",
    "an attractive bonus of an additional 1.7% of the rate could be gained if the threshold can be kept below 150 ev since m - capture would be accessible .",
    "+ the munich group has made significant progress in experiments for cryogenic detection of @xmath41ge .",
    "two types of experiments are of particular interest . in the first , 1 @xmath45 crystal of @xmath46ge",
    "was neutron activated thus producing @xmath41ge whose decays had @xmath36 coverage .",
    "attached to the crystal was a tungsten superconducting thin film transition edge thermometer ( at 15 mk ) with which the temperature pulses were measured .",
    "the resulting spectrum is shown in figure [ ucal_spectrum_fig ] and for comparison figure [ gallex_spectrum_fig ] is a typical gallex proportional counter result for the same decay .",
    "the effect of @xmath36 acceptance and improved resolution is clearly evident .     in micro - calorimeter .",
    "]     in gallex proportional counter . ]    in a solar neutrino experiment it is ge from geh@xmath23 which must be attached to a crystal . as a first step in using geh@xmath23 a thermally decomposed sample of geh@xmath23 was deposited onto a 1@xmath16 g sapphire crystal equipped with an iridium - gold transition edge thermometer . due to the @xmath47 nature of the decay coverage",
    "the detection was not hermetic ; however good resolution ( 160 ev on the 5.89 kev mn @xmath44 calibration line ) was obtained and the features of the @xmath41ge decay were clearly observed .",
    "they have also done some initial work on @xmath48ar . +",
    "this work is continuing and among the immediate projects are improvements in the electronics to obtain a threshold low enough for seeing the m - line , developing a two crystal  sandwich \" as a @xmath36 hermetic device with readout on both sides for energy summing , reducing the contributions from deposition in the thermometer glue ( see the high - side tail in fig .",
    "6 ) and , crucially , finding a high efficiency method for placing the ge from geh@xmath23 on the crystals .",
    "this is perhaps the most ambitious project @xcite and while it does not aim to be the ",
    "complete \" solar neutrino detector it does give a measure of the task to realize a single detector more inclusive of reaction types and range of energies .",
    "its principal aims are to make a model independent test of flavor non - conservation ( including sterile @xmath49 s ) , to determine the precise energies and widths of the lines of @xmath37be ( 862 kev ) , p - e - p ( 1.4 mev ) and the end point of the p - p continuum using the three channels of elastic , charged current and neutral current scattering of @xmath49 s .",
    "further , in the case of any observed flavor non - conservation , they wish to determine the msw parameters precisely if that is the mechanism involved .",
    "to carry out such a program , a massive detector with @xmath50 kev energy resolution is required .",
    "their idea is to create a gaas based , electronic , real - time detector .",
    "gallium and arsenic are chosen because they have no long - lived isotopes or ( n,@xmath51 ) daughters and for the possibility of good resolution due to the high multiplicity of e - hole pairs and low noise when cooled . however , they estimate this would require a 125 tonne ( 60 t of ga ) in 40,000 hyperpure 3.2 kg segments . among the primary reactions to be exploited are @xmath4 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "good resolution of the p - e - p and upper @xmath37be line would be an important advance ; however , a successful data analysis to achieve fully the above goals will be a very challenging one in that it relies upon use of the shape of the elastic differential cross - section to separate @xmath2 and @xmath54 as well as requiring a separation of the charged current p - p events .",
    "extreme purity ( from u , th , @xmath55k & @xmath27c ) of the gaas as well as its electronic performance for devices as large as 3.2 kg must be tested and assured .",
    "+ r&d on this project has recently begun .",
    "it centers primarily on three areas : a ) production of testable , small gaas devices made from sizable boules , b ) tests of the electronic properties of these small devices and c ) , based on results from these tests , investigation of new crystal growing methods to produce improved quality and larger boules .",
    "they report that in russia twenty , high quality 1 kg gaas ingots have been grown for them . and that from these ingots , several 400 @xmath16 m thick working detectors have been made and their electrical properties measured .",
    "they find that most properties for these small devices are equal in quality to the best in the field but still fall short of what would be needed in the full - sized solar neutrino device .",
    "they find high electron mobility but need significant improvement in charge collection .",
    "they are preparing to take the next step to increase the thickness of the electrical test devices to 1 mm thickness and they are studying new crystal growing methods adaptable to their existing furnaces . + there is still a very , very long way to go on this very bold project but if it can be shown to be feasible it may be the closest we will ever get to a  universal \" solar neutrino detector .",
    "the field of solar neutrino physics has certainly come of age as the exciting results so far are showing . from super - kamiokande and the other second generation experiments , sno , borexino and gno ,",
    "just coming on line we can expect new crucial tests of neutrino properties .",
    "however , it is well to keep in mind that these experiments and their predecessors would not have been possible without the invention of new ( or by pushing to the limit ) experimental techniques .",
    "we are still only part of the way to having the experimental capabilities we need over the full solar spectrum . in order to go beyond what we now can do",
    ", we need new techniques .",
    "+ i have tried to show by the projects described here that there is an active world - wide r & d effort making important progress on several fronts toward these goals ; but we should keep in mind that we are not fully there yet and there is always room for more , new ideas .",
