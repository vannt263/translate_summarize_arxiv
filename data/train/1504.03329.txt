    "since the discovery that most , if not all , galaxy spheroids in the local universe host a supermassive black hole ( smbh ) whose mass scales with that of the host - galaxy bulge ( e.g. , @xcite ) it has been clear that there is likely to be a tight connection between the evolution of smbhs and galaxies .",
    "studies of the galaxy population across cosmic time have shown that galaxies were more actively growing in the past , as the star - formation rate ( sfr ) density peaks at redshift @xmath10 and rapidly declines to the present day ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a similar evolution is seen in the moderate - to - high luminosity active galactic nucleus ( agn ) population , where most of the smbhs accrete more rapidly at high redshift ( @xmath11  1 - 2 ) , becoming more quiescent at @xmath12 ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ) . whether this parallel evolution between galaxies and smbhs is simply due to a larger gas supply to feed both black hole accretion and star formation at high redshift , or whether there are other processes that self - regulate the smbh and galaxy growth is still uncertain ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a complete census of agn is crucial to fully understand the accretion history of the smbhs and their role in galaxy evolution .",
    "however , as the universe at high redshift is more gas and dust rich , most of the accretion onto smbhs is expected to be heavily obscured , which makes the identification and study of a large fraction of the agn population very challenging .",
    "x - ray observations provide arguably the most efficient way to trace the growth of smbhs , as the high energy radiation can penetrate large amounts of gas and dust without significant absorption .",
    "moreover , the contamination from galaxy emission at x - ray energies is small as galaxies are typically much fainter than agn in this band .",
    "however , when the column density of the obscuring material becomes compton thick ( ct ; @xmath13  @xmath5 ) even the deepest x - ray surveys often fail to detect the population of the most obscured , ct agn ( e.g. , @xcite ; see @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "a significant fraction of such agn is predicted by all models of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) to reproduce the observed background spectrum at high energies ( @xmath14  kev ; e.g. , @xcite ) , however , the actual contribution from ct agn is not well constrained and varies between the models , due to different assumptions , and the space density of ct agn is still uncertain .    since most of the absorbed agn emission is re - emitted in the mid - infrared band ( mir ; @xmath15  3 - 40  @xmath16 m ) by the circumnuclear dust heated by the central smbh , observations in this band can potentially identify the elusive ct agn missed by x - ray surveys ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , since the infrared ( ir ) band is much less affected by extinction than the uv , optical and soft x - ray bands , the selection of agn in the mir band is almost unbiased against obscured agn .",
    "the downside of using the ir band to study agn is the strong contamination from star formation ( sf ) in the host galaxies , whose cold dust emission tends to dominate the mir to far - ir ( fir , @xmath15  40 - 250  @xmath16 m ) bands , peaking at @xmath15  100 - 160  @xmath16 m .",
    "this is especially the case for low - to - moderate luminosity agn , whose ir emission is often swamped by sf .",
    "these sources are easily missed by typical mir colour - colour sample selection , which are generally used to identify agn within the star - forming galaxy ( sfg ) population ( e.g. , @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we investigate a sample of mir luminous quasars ( hereafter , `` ir quasars '' ) at redshift @xmath2  1 - 3 , i.e. , at the peak era of agn and sf activity .",
    "we used the deepest available _ spitzer _  and _ herschel _  data in the goods-_herschel _  north and south fields ( hereafter , gh - n and gh - s , respectively ; @xcite ) to reliably identify agn in the mir band through detailed spectral energy distribution ( sed ) analyses , which allow us to disentangle the agn and sf emissions at mir and fir wavelengths .",
    "the sed analysis is a much more powerful tool than the simple ir colour - colour techniques for identifying agn , as it can recover the hot dust emission from the agn even when it does not strongly dominate the sed ( e.g. , @xcite ) ; however even the sed analyses have limitations and become incomplete when the agn component is faint compared to the sf component . using the deepest",
    "_ chandra _  x - ray data available across the sky ( 2 ms in cdf - n ; @xcite ; and 4 ms in cdf - s ; @xcite ) , we investigate the x - ray spectra of the ir quasars to constrain the fraction of obscured and ct sources .",
    "we also investigate the properties of their host galaxies to place them in the context of potential smbh - galaxy evolution scenarios .",
    "the paper is organised as follows : in section 2 the data used in our analyses are described , while section 3 details the sed analysis method and the selection of our ir quasar sample .",
    "section 4 presents the x - ray spectral analysis and results for our quasars , as well as the properties of their host galaxies assessed by the sfrs derived from our sed analyses , and their morphologies , obtained from visual classification of @xmath17-wfc3 @xmath18-band images . in section 5 the results obtained from our analyses are discussed in the wider context of the cxb models and the smbh - galaxy evolutionary scenario .",
    "a summary and final remarks are given in section 6 . throughout the paper",

    "to constrain the ir emission from the agn and the host galaxies , our sed fitting approach uses an empirical agn template and five different star - forming galaxy templates from @xcite , which have been extended down to 3 @xmath16 m and to the radio band ( dm13 ) .",

    "we note that this is not the case for all the sources , as at @xmath45 the 8  @xmath16 m data point falls out of the wavelength range covered by our sed templates .",
    "moreover , in some cases the 16  @xmath16 m data are upper limits and therefore can not provide strong constraints to the mir power - law slope . however , where the fits with @xmath46 as free parameter provided a better representation of the data compared to a fixed @xmath42 , we adopted these fits as the best - fitting solutions . ] an extinction law ( @xcite ) is also applied to the agn template , with the extinction parameter @xmath47 free to vary in the range of @xmath48  0 - 30  mag ( @xcite ; dm13 ) .",

    "photometric points are used to constrain the source seds ( see figures [ fig.sed ] and [ fig.sed1 ] in appendix ) ; the _ spitzer _  irac flux densities at 3.6 , 4.5 , and 5.8  @xmath16 m are not included in the sed analysis because these data are likely to be dominated by starlight emission , which is not taken into account in our templates .",
    "the seds for all of the 24  @xmath16m - detected sources with redshift measurements in the gh - n and gh - s fields have been initially fitted with the sfg templates only , and subsequently with the agn @xmath49 sfg templates obtaining a best - fitting solution for each of the sfg templates , using a @xmath50 fitting technique ( see dm13 , for details ) .",
    "we adopted the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; @xcite ) to assess the improvement of the fits due to the addition of the agn component to each of the sfg templates , and therefore to identify the best - fitting model for each source .",
    "namely , the agn @xmath49 sfg model is assumed as the best - fitting model if for each source :    * @xmath51 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , where @xmath52  1 - 5 refers to each of the sfg templates , in at least 4 out of the 5 pairs of best - fitting solutions ; + * @xmath53 , with @xmath54 , i.e. , the minimum @xmath50 of the agn @xmath49 sfg solutions that satisfy condition ( 1 ) should be less than the minimum @xmath50 obtained by fitting any of the sfg templates alone .",
    "if any of these criteria is not met we conservatively adopt the simple sfg model as the best - fitting model .",
    "these criteria are adopted to assess the reliability of the agn component independently from the individual sfg templates .",
    "in fact , due to the sparse data points available for our sed analysis , in some cases , individual fitting solutions from different templates yield similarly good fit to the data , preventing us from identifying a unique best - fitting solution .",
    "we refer to section 3.1 and appendix a of dm13 , for a detailed description of the sed fitting approach and tests on its reliability .- test .",
    "the bic is a more appropriate statistical criterion to compare the results from different models than the @xmath55-test when the models are non - nested . ]    after identifying the best - fitting model , we derived the luminosity of the agn ( i.e. , corrected for the galaxy contribution ) at rest - frame 6  @xmath16 m ( @xmath56 ) , the ir luminosity of the agn ( @xmath57 ) calculated across the wavelength range @xmath58  81000  @xmath16 m , and the ir luminosity of the sfg ( @xmath58  81000  @xmath16 m ; hereafter @xmath59 ) , as weighted means of the values obtained from the five best - fitting model solutions ( or from all the solutions satisfying condition ( 1 ) for the agn @xmath49 sfg model ) . where the agn component was not significantly identified an upper limit to the agn luminosity at 6  @xmath16 m was set as 50% of the total 6  @xmath16 m emission ( figure [ fig.l6z ] ) , i.e. , the limit for the sfg component becoming dominant at 6  @xmath16 m . for the cases where the fir data ( 100 , 160 and 250 @xmath16 m ) are all upper limits and our sed fitting approach did not provide a reliable measurement of the sf emission , we estimated an upper limit for @xmath59 by increasing the normalisation of the sf templates until they reached any of the fir upper limits , without exceeding any of the mir data point measurements ( including errors ) .",

    "indeed , the x - ray spectral analysis and the comparison between the x - ray and mir luminosities indicate that the vast majority of these ir quasars are obscured ( up to @xmath330% , 26 out of 33 sources ) , of which a large fraction are candidates to be ct ( up to @xmath331% , i.e. , 16 out of 33 quasars ) .",

    "further diagnostics are needed for the remaining 8 ct quasar candidates to confirm their nature .",
    "eight of our ct quasar candidates have also been classified as ct ( or ct candidates ) in previous studies ( see table [ tab4 ] , for reference ) , however , the remainders have never been identified to date .",
    "our results therefore indicate that there is a large population of obscured and heavily - obscured quasars at @xmath10 and confirm that the selection of sources in the mir band allows us to find even the most obscured , ct quasars , that are missing in the optical and x - ray bands .",
    "several studies conducted in the optical and x - ray bands have shown that the fraction of obscured agn decreases with luminosity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "this means that the probability of seeing obscured high - luminosity quasars is smaller than for lower luminosity agn , as the fast accreting smbhs spend a shorter time in this `` obscured phase '' .",

    "<S> we present the infrared ( ir ) and x - ray properties of a sample of 33 mid - ir luminous quasars ( @xmath0 erg  s@xmath1 ) at redshift @xmath2  13 , identified through detailed spectral energy distribution analyses of distant star - forming galaxies , using the deepest ir data from _ spitzer _  and _ herschel _  in the goods-_herschel _  fields . </S>",
    "<S> the aim is to constrain the fraction of obscured , and compton - thick ( ct , @xmath3@xmath4  @xmath5 ) quasars at the peak era of nuclear and star - formation activities . despite being very bright in the mid - ir band , @xmath630% of these quasars </S>",

    "<S> x - ray spectral analysis of the detected sources reveals that the majority ( @xmath667% ) are obscured by column densities @xmath3@xmath7  @xmath5 ; this fraction reaches @xmath680% when including the x - ray undetected sources ( 9 out of 33 ) , which are likely to be the most heavily - obscured , ct quasars . </S>",
    "<S> we constrain the fraction of ct quasars in our sample to be @xmath624 - 48% , and their space density to be @xmath8 mpc@xmath9 . from the investigation of the quasar host galaxies in terms of star - formation rates </S>",
    "<S> ( sfrs ) and morphological distortions , as a sign of galaxy mergers / interactions , we do not find any direct relation between sfrs and quasar luminosity or x - ray obscuration . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> there is tentative evidence that the most heavily - obscured quasars have , on average , more disturbed morphologies than the unobscured / moderately - obscured quasar hosts , which preferentially live in undisturbed systems . </S>",
    "<S> however , the fraction of quasars with disturbed morphology amongst the whole sample is @xmath640% , suggesting that galaxy mergers are not the main fuelling mechanism of quasars at @xmath10 .    </S>",
