    "the effect of possible grb rate evolution has also been discussed in a number of papers ( see , e.g. , cohen & piran 1995 ; rutledge , hui , & lewin 1995 ) using some analytic forms of grb rate evolution , e.g. , @xmath11 .    the best candidate for the cosmological origin of grbs is widely considered to be mergers of binary neutron stars ( see , e.g. , narayan , paczyski , and piran 1992 , and references therein ) .",

    "the constant sfr approximation in spiral galaxies is therefore no longer justified even at @xmath14 .",
    "because the star formation history in a galaxy is strongly correlated to its present - day colors or spectra , that are different among the morphological types of galaxies , it is also possible to construct a model of cosmic star formation history based on the spectrum of local galaxies by using galaxy evolution models of stellar population synthesis ( totani , sato , & yoshii 1996 ; totani , yoshii , & sato 1997 ) . in this letter",

    "we use two models of the star formation history : one is based on the recent observations of high redshift sfrs , and the other is a theoretical model based on the galaxy evolution models of stellar population synthesis ( arimoto & yoshii 1987 ; arimoto , yoshii , & takahara 1992 , hereafter ayt ) .",
    "the cosmic evolution of comoving merger - rate density of binary neutron stars ( @xmath15 ) as a function of cosmic time @xmath16 is given by a convolution of cosmic sfr density ( @xmath17 ) and probability distribution of the time from formation to merger of a binary system ( @xmath18 ) , i.e. , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the formation epoch of galaxies .",
    "we have assumed here the binary formation rate is proportional to the star formation rate . because the massive stars in high - mass binary systems evolve into double neutron stars with much shorter time scale than the typical time scale of galaxy evolution or the hubble time ( 110 gyrs ) ,",
    "the form of @xmath18 is essentially determined by the initial distribution of the separation between two neutron stars . since a compact binary with separation @xmath21",

    "we have chosen @xmath64 so as to set the age of galaxies to a reasonable value ( 12 gyrs ) .",
    "a general trend is that the allowed range for @xmath58 becomes smaller with increasing @xmath39 , because larger values of @xmath39 ( i.e. , softer spectra ) make the cosmological effect stronger , and @xmath58 has to become smaller to compensate the cosmological effect .",
    "the left panels of this figure show that the observational sfr history favors @xmath2 because of the rapid decline of @xmath65 beyond @xmath12 , and this is inconsistent with the determination by mpp96 , although the significance of this discrepancy is difficult to assess due to the uncertainties in estimation of @xmath39 as well as in sfr observations . on the other hand ,",
    "the results of the grb rate derived from the galaxy evolution model ( right panels ) show that the existence of high redshift starbursts in elliptical galaxies alleviates the above discrepancy , because the grb rate continues to increase toward the past to redshift larger than @xmath66 23 .",

    "in any case , the redshift corresponding to a peak flux increases rapidly with decreasing flux below the batse limit , and future experiments with greater sensitivity will provide valuable information on the formation epoch of galaxies , especially for ellipticals .",
    "recent discovery of the metal absorption lines in the optical counterpart associated with grb970508 provides us an important and independent constraint on the distance to the source of the grb : @xmath74 ( metzger et al .",

    "a striking implication of our calculation is that the redshift of grb970508 is likely @xmath66 2 , just below the upper limit of metzger et al .",
    "although the possible dispersion in grb luminosity function may allow lower redshifts , it seems difficult to consider the absorption system at @xmath5 as the grb source , as long as we assume that grbs are produced by binary neutron - star mergers .",
    "some cosmological grb models other than the compact binary mergers , e.g. , failed ib supernovae ( woosley 1993 ) , predict the grb rate evolution that is proportional to sfr .",
    "we analyzed the batse data with the grb rate proportional to the models of the cosmic sfr history used in this letter .",
    "the grb rate evolution at @xmath37 = 01 becomes steeper than the case of binary mergers because of the lack of time lag during the spiral - in of compact binaries by gravitational wave radiation , and this requires larger @xmath58 or @xmath39 to compensate the steeper evolution of @xmath15 .",
    "therefore the allowed values for @xmath39 become even softer , apart from the determination of mpp96 .",
    "especially , with the observational sfr evolution , we found no acceptable fit with @xmath76 with 95 % c.l . , and it can be concluded that the compact binary scenario is more favorable than grb models that predict a grb rate proportional to sfr .",
    "we have not considered the normalization of @xmath15 from the sfr models , because the normalization does not affect the log@xmath6-log@xmath7 analysis . however",
    "the comparison of the model @xmath15 and observed number of grbs gives an important consistency check .",
    "the fit of our typical @xmath15 models to the batse data implies that the grb rate at @xmath37 = 0 is @xmath77 [ yr@xmath71mpc@xmath78 where @xmath79/(100 km / s / mpc ) . on the other hand , assuming the salpeter imf , flat distribution of the mass ratio of binary systems , and binary formation rate equal to sfr , we can estimate the binary merger rate expected from the cosmic sfr history , that becomes about @xmath80 [ yr@xmath71mpc@xmath78 at @xmath43 .",
    "the expected rate is therefore @xmath81 times larger than the observation of batse , and the beaming of grbs with @xmath82 may be required .",
    "this result is consistent with the previous estimate of lipunov et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , although it should be noted that the above estimate has large uncertainties in sfr itself or conversion of sfr into merger rate .",
    "we have shown in this letter , for the first time , that the binary neutron - star merger scenario of the cosmological grbs naturally results in the comoving rate - density evolution of grbs roughly proportional to @xmath83 at low redshifts ( @xmath84 1 ) .",
    "it should be noted that such evolution has been suggested independently from the compatibility between the log@xmath6-log@xmath7 analysis and time dilation analysis ( horack , emslie , & hartmann 1995 ; horack , mallozzi , & koshut 1996 ; mszros & mszros 1996 ) .",
