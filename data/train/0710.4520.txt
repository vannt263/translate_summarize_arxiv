    "the brazil - japan collaboration detected many cosmic - ray events in the energy range @xmath2 with emulsion chamber exposed at mt .",
    "about twenty events were observed in the visible energy region @xmath3 .",
    "approximately , half of them  @xcite were associated with a uniformly darkened wide area on x - ray films .",
    "the central part of this area was called `` halo '' , and so these events were called `` halo events '' .",
    "similar events were also observed in experiments at pamir  @xcite , fuji  @xcite , and kanbala  @xcite .",
    "recently , a new experiment  @xcite , using a hadron calorimeter associated with emulsion chambers at mt .",
    "chacaltaya , reported this kind of events as well .",
    "thus , the appearance of a strong concentration of energy and particles as a halo seemed to be a common feature in this energy region .",
    "after the 1980s , these super - families were also compared with simulations using different primary compositions and models for high - energy nuclear interactions  @xcite .",

    "an important issue in the high energy region concerns the behavior of the inelasticity , which is defined as the fraction of energy given up by the leading hadron in a collision induced by an incident hadron on a target nucleon or nucleus .",
    "this parameter has been exhaustively studied in several papers , but until now it continues to be an open question .",
    "several authors have suggested that the average inelasticity coefficient is an increasing function of the energy  @xcite , whereas others have proposed that it is a decreasing one  @xcite .",
    "high energy cosmic rays , which reflect the nuclear interaction in the energy region covering @xmath4 , are well fitted with a constant mean inelasticity 1/2  @xcite . at higher energies , where these super - families belong ,",

    ", we believe much of the difficulties in developing an analytic approach of cascade lies on the fact that the widely used standard diffusion equation in mellin transform space is not a mathematically rigorous equation , due to the approximations used in the evaluation of the double energy integral that brings in the entity @xmath0 . because of this fundamental inconsistency at the very beginning , it is reasonable to understand that each level of the cascade would compound the array of free parameters . in section  [ nucdiffusion ] ,",

    "the first is the exact representation of the diffusion equation through faltung formulation with elasticity distribution as the basic input function .",
    "this exact formulation eliminates unnecessary free parameters that only serve to contaminate and distort models such as @xmath0 which is forced upon by a bad derivation .",
    "the second is the use of essential residues to evaluate the flux which has been overlooked by earlier investigators .",
    "the third is the use of elasticity distribution @xmath1 and consequently the self - consistent @xmath127 to evaluate the flux .",
    "because of these three aspects , our model with no free parameters gives results compatible to observations using only a simple uniform elasticity distribution .",

    "<S> it is shown that the fundamental standard hadron cascade diffusion equation in the mellin transform space is not rigorously correct because of the inconsistent double energy integral evaluation which generates the function @xmath0 with its associated parametizations . to ensure an exact basic working equation , </S>",
    "<S> the faltung integral representation is introduced which has the elasticity distribution function @xmath1 as the only fundamental input function and @xmath0 is just the mellin transform of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this faltung representation eliminates standard phenomenological parameters which serve only to mislead the physics of cascade . </S>",
    "<S> the exact flux transform equation is solved by the method of characteristics , and the hadron flux in real space is obtained by the inverse transform in terms of the simple and essential residues . since the essential residues are given by the singularities in the elasticity distribution and particle production </S>",
