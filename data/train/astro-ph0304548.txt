    "ongoing deep x - ray surveys of selected galactic regions have sparked a renewed interest in low - luminosity galactic x - ray sources such as wind - accreting neutron stars .",
    "newton galactic plane survey ( e.g.  warwick 2002 ) , the xmm - newton serendipitous survey ( watson 2001 ; motch et al .  2002 ; motch , herent & guillout 2003 ; watson et al .",
    "2003 ) and the serendipitous chandra multi - wavelength plane survey ( grindlay et al . 2003 ) will all probe the faint galactic x - ray point source population .    the discovery by chandra of more than 500 previously undetected point sources with luminosities above @xmath5 erg / s in a @xmath6 field near the galactic centre ( wang , gotthelf & lang 2002 ) dramatically illustrates the potential of such surveys and has already prompted complementing theoretical studies .",
    "pfahl , rappaport & podsiadlowski ( 2002 ) considered the population of neutron stars that accrete from the wind of an intermediate- or high - mass star ( mass @xmath7 ) .",
    "they found that these wind - driven intermediate - mass and high - mass x - ray binaries may indeed account for a dominant fraction of the point source population found by wang et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .    independently , bleach ( 2002 )",
    "investigated the possibility of detecting detached close binaries consisting of a neutron star and a red dwarf , which may be the progenitors of low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "the proposed detection mechanism consists of looking for red dwarfs with x - ray luminosities larger than those expected from intrinsic x - ray emissions from the star s corona .",
    "the excess could then possibly be ascribed to the emission of x - rays by a neutron star companion accreting mass from the wind of the red dwarf .",
    "our aim in this paper is to elaborate on the idea by bleach ( 2002 ) and examine the detection probability of pre - lmxbs , i.e.  detached neutron - star systems with low - mass companions ( mass @xmath8 ) , in the context of a binary population synthesis study .",
    "in close binary systems of stars , mass can be transferred from one component to the other when one of the stars loses mass in a stellar wind or when one of the stars fills its roche lobe . if the companion star is a compact object which is able to accrete some of the transferred mass , the liberation of gravitational potential energy gives rise to an accretion luminosity @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the newtonian constant of gravitation , @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the mass and the radius of the accreting compact object , and @xmath13 is the mass - accretion rate .",
    "we assume that the accretion process yields an x - ray luminosity @xmath14 .    in the particular case of a wind - accreting neutron star , the spin evolution of the neutron star and the possible inhibition of accretion by strong centrifugal forces may play an important role in the study of the accretion process ( e.g. pringle & rees 1972 ; illarionov & sunyaev 1975 ; stella , white , rosner 1986 ; urpin , geppert & konenkov 1998 ) .",
    "the treatment of these inhibiting effects is however beyond the scope of this initial investigation . instead",
    ", we assume that at the onset of mass transfer via the stellar wind , the neutron star s radiation pressure and rotation rate is low enough for mass accretion to be possible .",
    "the evolution of binaries containing a neutron star is driven by the nuclear evolution of the companion star or by the loss of orbital angular momentum via magnetic braking and/or gravitational radiation . when the combined effect of these processes causes the companion to become larger than its roche - lobe",
    ", an x - ray binary may be formed .",
    "the further evolution of the binary depends critically on the orbital period and the mass of the donor star at the onset of roche - lobe overflow .",
    "the formation and evolution of x - ray binaries with low - mass donor stars have been discussed extensively in the past by , e.g. , verbunt ( 1993 ) ; verbunt & van den heuvel ( 1995 ) ; iben & tutukov ( 1995 ) ; kalogera & webbink ( 1996 , 1998 ) ; kalogera ( 1998 ) ; kalogera , kolb & king ( 1998 ) ; and more recently by podsiadlowski , rappaport & pfahl ( 2002 ) .",
    "we therefore refer to these studies and references therein for detailed discussions on the various formation channels and here consider the population of x - ray binaries descending from the different channels as a whole .    for the purpose of this investigation",
    ", we define a candidate pre - lmxb as a detached binary in which a neutron star accretes mass from the stellar wind of its companion .",
    "we assume the latter to be on the main sequence , in the hertzsprung gap , or on the giant branch , and to have a mass smaller than or equal to @xmath15 .",
    "the luminosity associated with the accretion process is required to be larger than @xmath16 or ten times the mass donor s coronal x - ray luminosity , whichever is larger .",
    "we note that our definition of pre - lmxbs differs from that of bleach ( 2002 ) in that we consider stars with masses up to @xmath15 and binaries that are expected to become semi - detached due to the nuclear evolution of the secondary as well as those that are expected to become semi - detached due to angular momentum losses via magnetic braking and/or gravitational radiation .",
    "similarly , we define a lmxb as a semi - detached system in which a neutron star accretes mass from a roche - lobe filling main - sequence , hertzsprung - gap , or giant - branch star with a mass smaller than or equal to @xmath15 . in order",
    "to be classified as an x - ray binary , we furthermore require the mass - accretion rate to be high enough to produce an x - ray luminosity in excess of @xmath17 .    for the remainder of the paper , we denote the mass and the radius of the neutron star by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , and the mass and the radius of the donor star by @xmath20 and @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "we explore the possibility of detecting and identifying lmxbs prior to the onset of roche - lobe overflow from the neutron star s companion by means of the biseps binary population synthesis code described by willems & kolb ( 2002 ) .",
    "the code is based on the analytic approximation formulae for the evolution of single stars derived by hurley , pols & tout ( 2000 ) and follows the main lines of the binary evolution algorithm described by hurley , tout & pols ( 2002 ) .",
    "the binary orbits are assumed to be circular and the stellar rotation rates are kept synchronised with the orbital motion at all times .",
    "we furthermore restrict ourselves to population  i stellar compositions .    for the purpose of this investigation , the mass - loss rates from stellar winds given by hurley et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which are limited to evolved stars and massive main - sequence stars , must be supplemented by a prescription for the winds from low - mass main - sequence stars .",
    "although these winds are not fully understood yet , it is generally accepted that they depend sensitively on both the mass and the age of the donor star ( e.g. wood et al .",
    "2002 , and references therein ) .",
    "young solar - type stars and m dwarfs , for instance , are thought to have mass - loss rates which may be as high as @xmath22 per year , while older g dwarfs such as the sun have mass - loss rates of the order of @xmath23 per year ( hartmann 1985 , lim & white 1996 , van den oord & doyle 1997 , wargelin & drake 2001 , sackmann & boothroyd 2003 ) . in view of these still existing uncertainties",
    ", we here simply adopt a constant mass - loss rate of @xmath24 per year for low - mass main - sequence stars ( see also bleach 2002 ) .",
    "the resulting mass - loss rates are shown in fig .",
    "[ wind ] for donor stars with masses up to @xmath15 and evolutionary stages from the zero - age main sequence up to the tip of the giant branch .",
    "the lines labelled zams , tms , and bgb represent the radii of the stars at the zero - age main sequence , the terminal main sequence , and the base of the giant branch , respectively .",
    "the maximum evolutionary age considered for the calculation of the mass - loss rates is 10gyr , so that only stars with masses larger than @xmath25 significantly evolve away from the zero - age main sequence .",
    "we estimate the mean mass - accretion rate onto a star orbiting in the stellar wind of its companion by means of a standard bondi - hoyle - lyttleton formalism ( hoyle & lyttleton 1941 , bondi & hoyle 1944 ) .",
    "the accretion rate for binaries with circular orbits then depends on the orbital separation @xmath26 , the binary mass ratio @xmath27 , the donor star s radius @xmath21 , the wind mass - loss rate @xmath28 , and the wind velocity @xmath29 .",
    "we parametrise the latter as a fraction @xmath30 of the escape velocity @xmath31 at the surface of the mass - losing star ( see , e.g. , hurley et al . 2002 ) .",
    "the mean wind mass - accretion rate can then be cast in the form @xmath32 in the particular case of a wind - accreting neutron star the mass ratio is given by @xmath33 .",
    "the detection mechanism for pre - lmxbs proposed by bleach ( 2002 ) furthermore requires a prescription for the intrinsic x - ray luminosity of the neutron star s companion .",
    "since this luminosity is thought to have its origin in dynamo processes generated by the interaction between convection and rotation , it can be expected to be correlated with the star s rotational angular velocity ( e.g. belvedere , chiuderi & paterno 1982 ; noyes et al .",
    "the existence of such a correlation was explored extensively from an observational point of view by , e.g. , pallavicini et al . ( 1981 ) ; marilli & catalano ( 1984 ) ; vilhu ( 1984 ) ; doyle ( 1987 ) ; fleming , gioia & maccacaro ( 1989 ) ; hempelmann et al .",
    "( 1995 ) ; randich et al . 1996 ; singh et al . ( 1999 ) ; gondoin ( 1999 ) .",
    "the numerous investigations however show a clear lack of consensus on whether or not the correlation exists and , if it exists , what the precise relationship is between the rotational angular velocity and the coronal x - ray luminosity .",
    "this deficiency may be related to the use of different stellar samples and observational selection criteria ( hempelmann et al .",
    "1995 , gondoin 1999 ) .",
    "a point of lesser dispute seems to be the existence of an upper limit on the intrinsic stellar x - ray luminosity , although its origin remains to be unambiguously identified ( walter 1982 , byrne et al . 1984 , vilhu & walter 1987 , jardine & unruh 1999 , singh et al .",
    "the upper limit may be related to the finite size of the stellar surface in the sense that the magnetic activity can only increase with increasing rotational angular velocities until the whole stellar surface is covered with magnetically active regions .",
    "based on this idea , fleming et al .",
    "( 1989 ) showed that the coronal saturation luminosity @xmath34 could be related to the square of the stellar radius @xmath21 as @xmath35 where both @xmath34 and @xmath21 are expressed in solar units ( see their fig .",
    "3 ) .    rather than face the uncertainties regarding the relation between stellar rotation and coronal x - ray activity",
    ", we here opt to use a prescription for the upper limit on the coronal x - ray luminosity .",
    "we use the mass of the convective envelope , @xmath36 , to distinguish between coronally active and non - active stars and , somewhat arbitrarily , set the limit for coronal x - ray activity at @xmath37 .",
    "stars with smaller convective envelopes are assumed to have negligible coronal x - ray luminosities , while stars with larger convective envelopes are assumed to have coronal x - ray luminosities given by eq .",
    "( [ lcor ] ) .",
    "the upper limit may significantly overestimate the coronal x - ray luminosity of giant - type stars with slow rotation rates and correspondingly weak dynamos ( schrder , hnsch & schmitt 1998 ; gondoin 1999 ) .",
    "the slow rotation , however , only applies to giants in wide binaries where tidal forces are negligible .",
    "giants in closer binaries are subjected to tidal torques which tend to synchronise the giant s rotation with the orbital motion of the companion . a significant dynamo action may therefore be sustained in these stars during much more evolved stages of stellar evolution than for single stars or stars in wide binaries .",
    "dempsey et al .",
    "( 1993 , 1997 ) have shown that in the particular cases of rs canum venaticorum ( rs cvn ) and by draconis ( by drac ) binaries the coronal x - ray luminosity of the giant - type component may still reach values up to @xmath38 . to be on the safe side",
    ", we therefore still use the upper limit given by eq .",
    "( [ lcor ] ) for stars that have evolved beyond the main - sequence .",
    "where relevant , we will discuss the possible implications of this on our results . in any case",
    ", we expect the consistent use of the upper limit for the coronal x - ray luminosity to imply that our selection criteria for the identification of pre - lmxbs are systematically too strict .",
    "we evolved a large number of binaries with initial component masses ranging from @xmath39 to @xmath40 and with initial orbital periods between 0.1 to 10000 days .",
    "we used logarithmically spaced grids consisting of 60 grid points for the initial stellar masses and 200 grid points for the initial orbital periods .",
    "the maximum evolutionary age considered was 10gyr . if a binary undergoes an asymmetric supernova explosion leading to the birth of a neutron star , 200 random kick velocities are generated from a maxwellian velocity distribution for the magnitude of the kick velocities .",
    "the evolution of the binaries surviving the explosion is then followed until the imposed age limit of 10gyr .",
    "the outcome of the binary evolution calculations depends on the parameters adopted for the various evolutionary processes a binary may be subjected to .",
    "we therefore vary the input parameters one at a time and compare the resulting populations of pre - lmxbs with that of a reference model . for the latter ,",
    "hereafter referred to as model  a , we adopt the same set of input parameters as in willems & kolb ( 2002 ) , i.e. the common - envelope ejection efficiency parameter takes the value @xmath41 , and the maxwellian kick - velocity dispersion takes the value @xmath42 km / s .",
    "in addition , we here adopt a standard value of 1.0 for the wind - velocity parameter @xmath30 .",
    "the different parameters adopted in the other population synthesis models are summarised in table  [ models ] . in the case of the different supernova - kick models ,",
    "the average kick velocities @xmath43 adopted in the maxwellian velocity distributions are listed in addition to the velocity dispersions @xmath44 .",
    "we also note that the variations in the wind - velocity parameter @xmath30 considered in models ma1 and ma2 are equivalent to considering variations in the wind mass - loss rate @xmath28 , but that the parameter @xmath30 is a more appropriate population synthesis parameter since it has a greater impact on the determination of the mean mass - accretion rate .",
    "this is readily illustrated by means of eq .",
    "( [ macc2 ] ) which shows that , to a first approximation , an increase in @xmath30 by a factor of @xmath45 corresponds to a decrease in @xmath28 by a factor of the order of @xmath46 .",
    "models cor1 , cor2 , and cor3 are introduced to assess the sensitivity of our results to the prescription for the coronal x - ray luminosity . in particular",
    ", the use of a constant value for @xmath34 in models cor1 and cor2 allows us to account for the possible effects of overestimating the coronal x - ray luminosity of giant - type stars by the use of eq .",

    "we have investigated the population of candidate pre - low - mass x - ray binaries according to the detection mechanism proposed by bleach ( 2002 ) .",
    "the mechanism is based on the search for low - mass stars with x - ray luminosities that are too large to be attributed to the stellar coronal activity , and on the subsequent identification of neutron star binaries amongst these stars .",
    "the x - ray excess in these binaries can then possibly be ascribed to the accretion of mass by the neutron star from the stellar wind of its companion .    in our study",
    ", we used the biseps binary population synthesis code described by willems & kolb ( 2002 ) .",
    "we limited ourselves to neutron star binaries with main - sequence , hertzsprung - gap , or giant - branch donor stars of mass @xmath47 and simulated the x - ray excess by the requirement that the x - ray luminosity generated by the wind - accreting neutron star be at least 10 times larger than the coronal x - ray luminosity of the mass - losing star .",
    "the x - ray luminosity associated with the accretion process was determined under the assumptions that no accretion - inhibiting effects such as strong centrifugal forces are present and that all gravitational potential energy of the infalling matter is converted into x - ray radiation .",
    "the maxiumum coronal x - ray luminosity for a star of a given mass and radius was assumed to be proportional to the square of the star s radius .",
    "it follows that , in the case of low supernova kick - velocity dispersions , the population of pre - lmxbs can be divided into two groups of systems : a long - period group with @xmath48 days and a short - period group with @xmath49 days .",
    "the division yields a bimodal distribution for the accretion luminosities of the candidate pre - lmxbs .",
    "the long - period systems produce a peak in the distribution around @xmath2 erg / s , while the short - period systems produce a peak near @xmath1 erg / s . for kick - velocity disperions larger than @xmath50",
    "km / s only the peak near @xmath1 erg / s remains .",
    "the luminosity at which the distribution peaks furthermore depends sensitively on the velocity of the donor star s wind .",
    "these results are derived under the assumption that the stellar and orbital parameters , and in particular the orbital period and the accretion luminosity , of pre - lmxbs remain unchanged after their formation .",
    "this assumption breaks down for binaries with @xmath51 and @xmath52 day in which the evolution is governed by the loss of angular momentum via gravitational radiation and/or magnetic braking , and for binaries with @xmath53 in which the evolution is governed by the nuclear evolution of the donor star .",
    "first , the decrease of the orbital period resulting from the angular momentum loss in binaries with @xmath54 and @xmath52 day yields an increase of the mean mass - accretion rate and thus of the accretion luminosity generated by the neutron star .",
    "however , from eqs .",
    "( [ lacc ] ) and  ( [ macc2 ] ) it follows that an increase of the accretion luminosity by a factor of 10 requires a decrease of the orbital period by a factor of @xmath55 . for a pre - lmxb with an orbital period of @xmath56 day , this comes down to a decrease of the period to @xmath57 hours .",
    "since neutron star binaries with secondaries more massive than @xmath58 becomes semi - detached before they can reach such short periods , we can expect that the neglect of the orbital evolution does not affect our estimates for the accretion luminosities by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "second , the nuclear evolution of donor stars more massive than @xmath59 may yield a significant increase of the star s radius and wind mass - loss rate within the age of the galaxy .",
    "the effect of both these evolutionary aspects is to increase the mean mass - accretion rate of the neutron star .",
    "however , for main - sequence stars less massive than @xmath15 , the increase of the stellar radius increases the mean mass - accretion rate by less than an order of magnitude [ see eqs .",
    "( [ lacc ] ) and ( [ macc2 ] ) ] . the overall effect on our results",
    "can therefore again be expected to be small .",
    "the main uncertainty for main - sequence donor stars consequently stems from their poorly understood wind mass - loss rates ( e.g. wargelin & drake 2001 ) .",
    "pre - lmxbs with donor stars that have evolved beyond the main - sequence , on the other hand , have better understood mass - loss rates , but contribute too little to the total population of newborn pre - lmxbs to have a significant effect on the distribution functions presented .",
    "in addition , systems with an orbital period of the order of a few days will evolve into lmxbs shortly after the secondary leaves the main sequence . a significant increase in the x - ray accretion luminosity is therefore only possible for wider systems which do not initiate roche - lobe overflow until the secondary is well on its way towards the tip of the giant branch or for systems which do not initiate roche - lobe overflow at all . for these systems",
    ", we may underestimate the maximum accretion luminosity by several orders of magnitude , but since the life time of a star on the giant branch is much shorter than its main sequence life time , the contribution of the systems to the pre - lmxb population during this phase is smaller than their contribution when the donor star was still on the main sequence .",
    "in addition , the wider orbital separations required for this scenario somewhat counteract the increase in the accretion luminosity associated with the evolution of the donor star .    finally , we estimated the total number of pre - lmxbs currently populating the galaxy to be of the order of @xmath60@xmath61 . for comparison ,",
    "the estimated number of rs cvn type binaries in the galaxy is of the order of @xmath62 ( watson 1990 ) and the theoretically predicted number of cataclysmic variables in the galaxy is of the order of @xmath63 ( kolb & willems 2003 , in preparation ) .",
    "both these types of systems have x - ray luminosities comparable to the @xmath1 erg / s peak luminosity found in our models for candidate pre - lmxbs . in addition , the distribution of x - ray luminosities at @xmath2 erg / s may be expected to be dominated by coronally active stars .",
    "our predicted number of pre - lmxbs satisfying the x - ray excess criterion is therefore small in comparison to the number of these other low - luminosity x - ray sources , but nevertheless high enough to possibly account for an interesting fraction of the low - luminosity discrete x - ray sources observed by chandra and xmm . a systematic search for candidate pre - lmxbs based on the x - ray excess criterion",
    "can in principle be initiated by comparing exisiting x - ray ( rosat , einstein , chandra and xmm ) and optical ( hipparcos , tycho , hst gsc ) source catalogs .",
    "simultaneous x - ray and optical observations by xmm provide an attractive alternative .",

    "<S> we explore the population of candidate pre - low - mass x - ray binaries in which a neutron star accretes mass from the wind of a low - mass companion ( mass @xmath0 ) in the framework of a binary population synthesis study . </S>",
    "<S> the simulated accretion - luminosity distribution shows a primary peak close to @xmath1 erg / s and a secondary peak near @xmath2 erg / s . </S>",
    "<S> the relative contribution of the two peaks depends primarily on the magnitude of the kick velocity imparted to the neutron star at birth . </S>",
    "<S> the secondary peak is negligible for average kick velocities larger than @xmath3 km / s , but becomes dominant for average kick velocities smaller than @xmath4 km / s . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the relative contributions of the two peaks , our calculations suggest that pre - low - mass x - ray binaries may provide a non - negligible contribution to the population of discrete low - luminosity x - ray sources in the galaxy .    </S>",
