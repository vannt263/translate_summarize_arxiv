    "the interest of the scientific community on supernovae ( sne ) has enormously increased in the recent years for several reasons .",
    "the advances in the understanding of the sn phenomena obtained with the intensive study of nearby sne , first of all sn  1987a , have raised new more fundamental questions with regard to progenitor evolution , explosion mechanism and nucleosynthesis . in addition , the calibration of the absolute magnitudes of a few snia obtained using the cepheid variables found in their parent galaxies ( saha et al . , 1999 , and references therein ) , and the discovery of empirical relations between the absolute magnitudes at maximum and the shape of the light curves of snia ( phillips 1993 , riess et al .",
    "1996 ) have renewed the interest for the utilization of snia as distance indicators up to cosmological distances .",
    "other exciting advances are expected for the association of some sne with the mysterious grbs .",
    "such wide interest has triggered new , deep sn searches which , in a few years have doubled the number of sn discoveries .",
    "the history of the asiago sn catalogue began in 1984 with the publication of data for 568 objects ( barbon et al .",
    "this was compiled starting from the palomar supernova master list which since 1958 from time to time appeared in the literature ( zwicky 1958 and 1965 , kowal and sargent 1971 , sargent et al .",
    "1974 ) . during the same period two",
    "other sn listing have been published , by karpowicz and rudnicki ( 1968 ) and by flin et al .",
    "( 1979 ) , the latter giving also the complete bibliography for each object .",
    "the 1984 asiago sn catalogue was superseded by a new edition in 1989 ( barbon et al .",
    "1989 , [ asc89 ] ) which listed information for the 661 supernovae discovered up to december 31 , 1988 .",
    "more recently , van den bergh ( 1994 ) published a list containing the 203 supernovae discovered between january 1 , 1989 and april 3 , 1994 and a _ catalogue of extragalactic supernovae _",
    ", complete up to 1993 , was published in volume v of the _ general catalogue of variable stars _ ( samus 1995 ) .    in the last few years we made available through the web at the url _ athena.pd.astro.it/@xmath0supern/ _ a running sn list which was widely utilized through the literature .",
    "other supernova listings are available electronically , e.g. the list at the cbat ( _ www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/supernovae.html_ ) , and that at sternberg astronomical institute ( _ www.sai.msu.su/cgi-bin/wdb-p95/sn/sncat/form_ ) .    the many requests for a new , reliable edition give the motivation for the preparation of the present paper .",
    "the new edition of the asiago sn catalogue lists data for 1447 sne and for their parent galaxies discovered up to 31 december , 1998 . for the galaxy data we made large use of the _ third reference catalogue of bright galaxies _ by de vaucouleurs et al .",
    "( 1991 , [ rc3 ] ) and of the leda and ned databases .",
    "the format of the new edition follows that of asc89 with some improvements .",
    "in particular , we have now included :    1 .",
    "accurate supernova positions .",
    "position angles of the major axes .",
    "morphological type code of the parent galaxies .",
    "accurate sn positions are mostly useful to compare observations at different wavelengths , from x - ray to radio , which in the recent years had a large impact in sn research .",
    "note that in the present catalogue all coordinates are given at the 2000.0 epoch .",
    "major axis position angles were introduced to study the position of the sne within the galaxies and numerical morphological type code to facilitate the derivation of descriptive statistics .    instead , we choose to drop the information on the parent galaxy luminosity classes because this information is available only for a small fraction ( less than 20% ) of the objects .",
    "the galaxy integrated luminosity can be computed from the apparent magnitudes and distances of the galaxies .    to facilitate the consultation of the catalogue ,",
    "we present it with two different sortings : in table 1 the list is arranged chronologically according to the date of sn discovery while in table 2 the same data are listed in order of right ascension .    in the tables , the content of the different columns is as follows :    supernova designation .",
    "the symbols `` ? '' denote a not confirmed sn and `` * '' the occurrence of multiple sn discoveries in the same galaxy .    parent galaxy identification . in case",
    "a galaxy has different identifications , we adopted the following priority : ngc , ic , mcg ( m ) , ugc , eso ( e ) , pgc , leda , others . in some cases specific names are reported , e.g. lmc .",
    "anonymous galaxies are listed with the letter a followed by the coordinates . in a few cases , where the association with a definite parent galaxy was not possible , we have filled the field with intergalactic .",
    "equatorial coordinates of the parent galaxy at the 2000.0 epoch .",
    "equatorial coordinates of the supernova at the 2000.0 epoch .",
    "morphological type of the parent galaxy .",
    "morphological type code for the parent galaxy ( coding as in rc3 )    only for disk - like system , inclination of the polar axis with respect to the line of sight in degrees ( @xmath1 for face on systems ) .",
    "position angle of the major axis of the parent galaxy ( north eastwards ) in degrees .",
    "heliocentric radial velocity of the parent in km  s@xmath2 , but for objects with redshift @xmath3 where the @xmath4 value has been listed .    integrated b magnitude of the parent , mostly from the rc3 or leda . in few cases",
    "only photographic magnitudes ( prefixed by `` p '' ) are available .",
    "decimal logarithm of the apparent isophotal diameter , in 0.1 arcmin units .",
    "sn offset from the galaxy nucleus in arcsec , in the e / w and n / s direction respectively .    if available , supernova magnitude at maximum ( photometric band indicated ) ; otherwise discovery magnitude ( labelled by `` * '' ) .",
    "a magnitude without band means that the observation has not been made in a standard photometric system ( e.g. those reported in the discovery announcement as photographic , blue plate , red plate , ccd without filter , and so on ) .",
    "supernova type , mostly from spectroscopy . in a few cases , marked by `` * '' ,",
    "types have been inferred from the light curve .    if known , epoch of maximum , otherwise `` * '' marks date of discovery .",
    "name(s ) of discoverer(s ) . for organized search teams",
    "the acronyms are given .",
    "a major effort has been devoted in searching the literature for accurate magnitudes , epochs of maximum and for assigning supernova types . for this latter task",
    "we are indebted to d. branch ( private communication ) who provided us with a list of revised supernova types for many sne . for the supernovae discovered in the periods from 1989 to 1992 and from 1992 to 1998 we have cross checked our data with those of van den bergh ( 1994 ) and the electronic list supplied by the cbat , respectively .",
    "discrepancies , in both cases , have been solved by looking at the original literature , mostly consisting of iau circulars .",
    "the galaxy coordinates are given with various degrees of accuracy depending on the accuracy of the original catalogue . for many anonymous galaxies ,",
    "in particular for the parent galaxies of high - z sne , the approximate galaxy position is derived from the supernova coordinates . in some cases",
    ", discrepancies may arise between the quoted off - sets of the supernova from the galaxy nucleus and the same data derived from the sn - parent relative coordinates ( see e.g. sn1965c ) .",
    "this happens especially for parent galaxies with ill defined nuclei .",
    "finally , a few supernovae have been discovered and observed only spectroscopically ( e.g sn1995bb ) and therefore they lack a photometric magnitude .      instead , table 4 lists the 20 objects which , from the beginning of the searches up to the present time , turned out not to be supernovae . among these latter objects ,",
    "sn1950e and 1956c were still included in asc89 .",
    "sn  1987 g has been deleted because it turned out to be the same object as sn  1987d .            finally , in fig .  [ hubble ] we plot the positions of all sne with redshift in the hubble diagram .",
    "the line is the expected location for `` standard '' snia having m(max)@xmath5 , ho=65 km / s  mpc , qo=0 .",
    "we remark that some sne , not of type ia , laying above this line have poor photometry .",
