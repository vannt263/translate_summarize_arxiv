    "as the prototypical topological field theory , the chern - simons gauge theory , has had a deep and broad impact on a wide range of physics research , ranging from knot theory@xcite and parity anomalies in quantum field theory@xcite to the theory of the integer and fractional quantum hall effects@xcite and the effective field theory description of chiral spin liquids@xcite in condensed matter physics ( for a review see , _",
    "e.g. _ ref . [ ] ) .",
    "although well understood as a continuum field theory , there is still limited understanding on how to discretize this topological field theory on 2d lattices or graphs.@xcite this task turns out to be highly nontrivial .",
    "in particular , the topological and gauge - theoretic nature of the chern - simons gauge theory enforces strong constraints on the dynamics of the gauge fields .",
    "these constrains , if not treated carefully , can result in inconsistencies in the discretized theory , making the theory ill - defined.@xcite until recently , the discretization has only been done only for a very special case , i.e. , on a square lattice ( with only nearest bonds ) embedded in a torus.@xcite it remains highly unclear whether similar construction can be extended for other lattices , or for lattices embedded on other 2d manifolds aside from the torus , or in any discretized systems without translation symmetries ( e.g. a graph ) . in a recent publication,@xcite we presented a consistent construction of the chern - simons gauge theory on one of the simplest non - bipartite lattices in two - dimensions , the kagome lattice , and used it to study the magnetizations plateaus of the spin-1/2 frustrated quantum heisenberg antiferromagnet on this lattice .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to develop a consistent discretization of the ( abelian ) chern - simons abelian u(1 ) gauge theory on general planar lattices and graphs .",
    "there are several motivations to search for a discretized chern - simons gauge theory on generic lattices / graphs .",
    "for example , it has been known that the chern - simons gauge theory plays a crucial role in the study of chiral spin liquid .",
    "such an exotic state of matter can only be stabilized in the presence of strong geometric frustration .",
    "much of the work in frustrated antiferromagnets uses the fact that these systems are equivalent to a system of ( generally interacting ) hard - core bosons on the same lattice .",
    "the hard - core bosons are then mapped into a system of fermions coupled to a discretized chern - simons gauge field.@xcite except for some very special exactly solvable models , in the study of such frustrated systems the dynamics and quantum fluctuations of the effective gauge fields are typically ignored , and frustrated quantum antiferromagnets are frequently described only at the level of the average field approximation.@xcite however , such a approximation is unreliable , and has a strong and obvious bias towards time - reveal breaking ground states . as shown in ref .",
    "[ ] , to correctly address the competition between different quantum ground states , it is necessary to go beyond the average field approximation by carefully introducing the correct quantum dynamics .",
    "it was recently realized that , in addition to the well known case of two - dimensional electron gases ( in the continuum ) in strong magnetic fields , the fractional quantum hall effect can also been stabilized in lattices even with zero net magnetic field.@xcite fractional quantum hall states have also been explored on lattice systems earlier on@xcite and , more recently , also in optical lattice systems.@xcite this type of ( discrete ) fractional topological states is now often referred to as the fractional chern insulators or the fractional quantum anomalous hall state . in particular , it has been shown that these ( discrete ) fractional chern insulators are adiabatically connected to the corresponding fractional quantum hall states in the continuum.@xcite    the chern - simons gauge theory is known to be the low - energy , hydrodynamic , theory of topological phases such as the fractional quantum hall fluids,@xcite they are also expected to describe the low - energy and long - distance limit of topological chern insulators , fractional or not.@xcite although chern - simons theories yield a natural description of the hydrodynamic behavior of topological phases , apriori they are not absolutely necessary in the microscopic construction of a theory of such states.@xcite however , all known fractionalized phases are in inherently strongly coupled systems and , notably in the case of the fractional quantum hall fluids , the use of chern - simons gauge theory in the microscopic derivations has been invaluable.@xcite aside from some recent and promising work,@xcite it is not yet clear what role does chern - simons gauge theory play in the theory of fractional topological chern insulators .",
    "although adiabatic continuity strongly implies that the theory of factional chern insulators should be smoothly related to the theory of the fractional hall effect on lattice systems,@xcite where discrete chern - simons gauge theory is expected to be generally applicable . the general answer to these questions has remained problematic in view of the fact that the chern - simons gauge theory has not been discretized on most of the lattices on which lattice fractional chern insulators are known to occur ( e.g. the checkerboard lattice , the kagome lattice and the multiple - orbital square lattice ) .",
    "although we will not give an answer for systems on lattices as general as it is needed , we will give an explicit construction for a large class of lattices , which include some of clear physical interest .",
    "in this paper , we propose and study a discretized chern - simons gauge theory on generic planar graphs embedded in arbitrary 2d closed and orientable manifolds.@xcite same as in a lattice gauge theory , we will define the space components of the gauge field to live on the nearest - neighbor bonds of the lattice and the time components on the sites ( vertices ) of the lattice .",
    "we will consider only planar lattices ( and hence with only non - crossing bonds).this is a lattice gauge theory@xcite but one with a broken time reversal and parity invariance . here",
    "we will be interested in a version of chern - simons theory on a a class of spatial lattices with continuous time .",
    "earlier work focused on the square lattice,@xcite and recently we discussed the case of the kagome lattice.@xcite discretized versions of chern - simons gauge theory have been discussed both in euclidean space - time lattices,@xcite which suffer from the species doubling problem analogous to those of lattice fermions . by enlarging the scope of investigation from periodic lattices to graphs ( with or without translational symmetries ) , our conclusions are generally applicable for a wide range of systems .",
    "we will require the discretized theory to retain the central features a topological field theory .",
    "chern - simons gauge theory on a continuous space - time manifold has several key features.@xcite it is gauge theory which means that it has a local symmetry under local ( in space - time ) gauge transformations . at the quantum level",
    "this requires that the quantum states of the physical hilbert space be gauge invariant,@xcite and hence that the generators of local time - independent gauge transformations must generate superselection sectors , i.e. the gauss law is satisfied as constraint on the physical space of states . for this requirement to be consistently implemented , the generators of local gauge transformations must commute with each other on different spatial locations . in the case of the chern - simons theory",
    "this implies that the local magnetic flux must commute with each other ( since they are the generator of time - independent gauge transformations ) .",
    "this condition imposes stringent constraints on the possible form of the discretized theories,@xcite and it is the main focus of this work .    on the other hand , at the classical level , the chern - simons theory is topological in the sense that the action is invariant under general coordinate transformations and hence it is independent of the metric .",
    "a consequence of this feature is that the energy - momentum tensor classically vanishes and , consequently , the hamiltonian is also zero . clearly , any lattice discretization implies a choice of coordinates , i.e. a fixed spatial metric .",
    "furthermore , a change of the lattice stricture leads to a change in the form of the metric . therefore",
    ", a lattice version of chern - simons theory can not be explicitly independent of the metric and , in this sense , it can not be formally topological .",
    "however , we will show below , that one can construct a chern - simons gauge theory for a large class of lattices a u(1 ) lattice gauge theory with continuous time ( i.e. in `` hamiltonian '' form@xcite ) which is gauge - invariant .",
    "we will see that the resulting discretized theory nevertheless has a vanishing hamiltonian since the content of the action reduces to a set of ( reasonably local ) equal - time commutation relations and a set of local and commuting constraints .",
    "this theory is topological in the sense that it does not have local excitations , and that only the global degrees of freedom ( non - trivial wilson loops ) matter . in the long - wavelength limit",
    "the discretized theory becomes ( formally ) the continuum chern - simons gauge theory .",
    "we find that such a chern - simons gauge theory can be constructed for arbitrary 2d planar graphs ( lattices ) as long as a _",
    "local vertex - face correspondence _ can be defined on the graph / lattice .",
    "we adopt the following definition :    a local vertex - face correspondence is a one - to - one correspondence between faces and vertices defined on a graph such that every vertex is adjacent to its corresponding face ( and vice versa ) .",
    "[ def : lvfc ]    an example of such a correspondence is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : local_correspondence ] .",
    "the relevance of this correspondence to chern - simons theory lies in the nature of this gauge theory . in the continuum the ( abelian ) chern - simons lagrangian of a gauge field @xmath0 in 2 + 1 dimensions",
    "is ( coupled to a matter current @xmath1 ) @xmath2= \\frac{k}{4\\pi } \\epsilon^{\\mu \\nu \\lambda } \\mathcal{a}_\\mu \\partial_\\nu \\mathcal{a}_\\lambda- j_\\mu \\mathcal{a}^\\mu \\label{eq : scs}\\ ] ] the chern - simons ( cs ) gauge theory is a topological field theory.@xcite at the classical level the cs action is independent on the metric of the manifold on which it is defined .",
    "the content of this lagrangian , eq , is seen in cartesian components @xmath3= &   \\frac{k}{2\\pi } \\mathcal{a}_0 \\mathcal{b } - j_0 \\mathcal{a}_0 \\nonumber\\\\ & - \\frac{k}{4\\pi } \\epsilon_{ij } \\mathcal{a}_i \\partial_t \\mathcal{a}_j - { \\bm j } \\cdot {",
    "\\bm { \\mathcal{a } } } \\label{eq : scs - components}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the quantum level , the first term of the r.h.s . becomes the requirement that the states in the physical hilbert space , @xmath4 , obey the `` gauss law '' as a local constraint .",
    "thus , the physical states are gauge - invariant and are annihilated by the generator of local gauge transformations , @xmath5 \\vert \\textrm{phys } \\rangle=0 \\label{eq : gausscs}\\ ] ] hence , the physical states are those in which the local charge density @xmath6 to the local magnetic flux @xmath7 are precisely related , i.e. flux attachment . the second term of the r.h.s . of eq . implies that the components of the gauge field obey the equal - time commutation relations , @xmath8=i \\frac{2\\pi}{k } \\epsilon_{ij}\\delta({\\bm x}-{\\bm y})\\ ] ] further , the hamiltonian of this system is zero unless sources are present , i.e. @xmath9 which is a consequence that a topological field theory does not have any excited states with finite energy .        as with any lattice gauge theory , in a discretized chern - simons gauge theory the gauge fields ( which are connections and hence are 1-forms ) are naturally defined on the links of the lattice while the matter fields are defined on the sites of the lattice.@xcite the field strength is a 2-form and it is defined on the elementary plaquettes of the lattice . while in a conventional lattice gauge theory the lattice is generally hypercubic ( i.e. square in 2d ) , here we will consider more general ( and translationally invariant ) planar lattices .",
    "for instance , in ref .",
    "[ ] ( and in refs . [ ] ) the chern - simons theory was defined on a square lattice and in ref .",
    "[ ] the theory was defined on a kagome lattice . in both cases the gauss law of eq .",
    "is naturally implemented as a constraint that relates the occupation number of a site ( or vertex ) to the gauge flux through a ( uniquely defined ) adjoint plaquette ( or face ) .",
    "while in the case of the square lattice all plaquettes are identical ( squares ) , in the case of the kagome lattice has three inequivalent sites in its unit cell and , correspondingly , three faces ( two triangles and a hexagon ) in its unit cell . nevertheless , the correspondence of vertices to faces is one - to - one in both lattices .",
    "we will see here that this correspondence is a key feature which will allow us to impose the constraint ( and hence gauge invariance ) in a unique way which , in addition , does not break the point group ( or space group ) symmetries of the lattice . below we will find a construction of the chern - simons gauge theory on lattices for which for a charge located at a vertex , the magnetic field attached to it by the chern - simons gauge theory is located at the face that is naturally paired up with this vertex .    whether or not a local vertex - face correspondence can be defined for a graph is fully determined by the connectivity of the graph . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lvfc ] , we will provide an sufficient and necessary condition , which can be used to decide whether such a correspondence exists or not for an arbitrary graph . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lattices_cs ] , we show some examples of lattices that support such a correspondence ( i.e. a discretized chern - simons gauge theory can be constructed on these lattices ) .",
    "these examples include some of the lattices used in the study of chiral spin liquids and the lattice fractional quantum hall effect ( e.g. the kagome lattice ) .",
    "it is also worthwhile to emphasized that in the continuum , the chern - simons gauge theory can be defined on arbitrary 2d closed and orientable manifolds .",
    "this plays a critical role in the phenomenon of topological degeneracy in fractional quantum hall systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is also known that all the essential physics of the chern - simons gauge theory ( in the continuum ) is stable against the explicit breaking of the translational symmetry , which is the underlying reason for the stability of the quantum hall states against weak disorders . on the discretized side , however , it is still unclear whether the chern - simons gauge theory can be defined on any manifold aside from a torus and/or on a discrete graph without translational symmetries .",
    "our study will provide an answer to these questions .",
    "in addition to those geometric considerations , a key consistency requirement of the gauge theory is that the lattice version of the local constraints of eq . must commute with each other and hence act as superselection rules on the hilbert space  @xcite",
    "( otherwise , these constraints can not be simultaneously satisfied ) . this consistency condition places restrictions on the commutation relations satisfied by the gauge fields defined on the links .",
    "for the square lattice this problem was solved by eliezer and semenoff,@xcite and was more recently generalized by us to the case of the kagome lattice.@xcite in this paper we will show that the commutation relations can be defined consistently on any lattice ( and graph ) which obeys the one - to - one correspondence between vertices and faces . we will show that this restriction is implemented in terms of a suitably defined non - singular ( and hence invertible ) matrix .",
    "therefore , the lattice chern - simons theory can be defined as a consistent gauge theory at the quantum level on these planar lattices and graphs .",
