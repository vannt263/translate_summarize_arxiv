    "ct argued that the results do not critically depend on the upper limit .",
    "we show below that this is not true .",
    "as ct noted , the divergence occurs due to the subtle interaction between matter and radiation in small scales .",
    "ct used a classical fluid equation with a constant collision frequency ( coulomb collision frequency ) .",
    "this collision frequency describes the binary interactions in the plasma .",
    "they chose the cut - off @xmath92 , basically because this is the value that makes the frequency spectrum smooth at the joining of the low - frequency and the blackbody spectrum .    in section vii of ct",

    "they argue that for @xmath93 the plasma has a negligible effect on the electromagnetic spectrum .",
    "let us call this k , @xmath94 ( @xmath95 ) .",
    "when treating coulomb collisions , a cut - off has to be taken , since at small distances the energy of the coulomb interactions of the particles exceeds their kinetic energy which violates the applicability of the condition of the perturbation expansion ( in the plasma parameter @xmath96 ) .",
    "this occurs approximately for distances @xmath97 or , more exactly , for the distance of closest approach between a test particle and an electron in a plasma , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , @xmath26 and @xmath100 are respectively , the mass , velocity and charge of the test particle [ 15 ] .    comparing the value of @xmath61 , @xmath94 and @xmath101",
    "we see that @xmath61 ( @xmath102 ) is much smaller than the others . for example",

    "as @xmath115 is quite arbitrary , we decided to vary the upper limit in the first term in eq .",
    "( [ meg ] ) , until @xmath116 to observe the behaviour of the curves .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 where again we plot @xmath117 vs @xmath118 .",
    "we plotted the low frequency spectrum term not only until @xmath119 , as ct did , but extended it to higher frequencies .",
    "the dash - dot - dash curve has the upper limit @xmath120 as ct used .",
    "the dotted curve has the upper limit @xmath121 ; the dashed curve has the upper limit @xmath122 ; and the dash - two dot - dash curve has the upper limit @xmath116 .",
    "we also plotted the blackbody spectrum in vacuum ( solid curve ) .",
    "it can be seen that by extending the upper limit to higher and higher values we obtain more and more of the blackbody spectrum , before the spectrum drops .",
    "this is easy to understand since , as we noted before , the magnetic field spectrum , obtained from the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ , contains the transverse eigenfrequencies of the plasma , the photons .",
    "when we extend the value of the upper limit , we permit higher eigenfrequencies to manifest themselves .",
    "this occurs up to the frequency when , due to the upper limit chosen , no more photons can manifest themselves .",
    "another feature that appears is that by increasing the upper limit the valley that appears , due to the plasma cut - off effect , becomes smaller and smaller .",
    "eventually , for @xmath116 , we obtain a large peak for @xmath123 but without any valley .",
    "in fact , for frequencies @xmath124 the curve is above the blackbody spectrum in vacuum .",
    "this can be seen in figure 3a , where the dashed curve is the low frequency term ( in eq .",
    "( [ meg ] ) ) extended to high frequencies ( not only for @xmath125 ) with @xmath116 compared to the blackbody spectrum in vacuum ( solid curve ) . in figure 3b",
    "we plotted only the _ cold plasma _ curve , extended to high frequencies , showing that with @xmath116 the full blackbody spectrum is reproduced .",
    "ct argued , based on the behavior of the _ cold plasma _ spectrum with @xmath120 , that the energy under the @xmath123 peak is approximately equal to the energy stolen from the blackbody spectrum due to the plasma cut - off . in their words , this happens because , the `` plasma squeezes the fluctuation energy of modes with frequency less than @xmath3 into modes with frequencies very close to zero '' .",
    "first of all , clearly , this does not happen if the upper limit is high enough in order to reproduce the full blackbody spectrum at high frequencies ( with @xmath116 ) because the entire curve is above the blackbody spectrum .",
    "second , we noted previously that a blackbody ( photon ) spectrum with a cut - off @xmath126 is expected taking into account that the photons only propagate for @xmath2 in a plasma , where @xmath3 is the plasma frequency .",
    "however , when we speak about blackbody , we speak about modes which propagate , in our case , photons . in vacuum ,",
    "the photons have a dispersion relation @xmath127 and they are present in the entire frequency spectrum . in a plasma ,",
    "when the dispersion relation is @xmath128 , they only appear for @xmath2 .",
    "dawson @xcite deduced the radiation spectrum in a plasma by a gedanken experiment .",
    "a slab of plasma at a temperature t is put between two blackbodies at temperature t. between the plasma and the blackbodies are vacuum regions .",
    "radiation is emitted by the blackbodies and enters the plasma . in equilibrium",
    ", the plasma radiates the same amount of radiation that it absorbs .",
    "dawson deduced the density of radiation in a plasma as : @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the radiation density in the plasma and @xmath131 the blackbody radiation density in the vacuum .",
    "it can be seen that a new factor appears , due to the presence of the plasma .",
    "this kind of gedanken experiment tells us , however , only about modes that propagate .",
    "nothing is told about the modes that do not propagate which appear due to correlations in the plasma .",
    "they are present at low frequencies , @xmath132 , but they also are present at @xmath2 , contributing , besides the photons , to the magnetic field spectrum .",
    "our results show that this happens only for very high frequencies ( @xmath23 ) when the photons dominate the magnetic field spectrum .",
    "the magnetic field fluctuation spectrum has little to do with the photon blackbody spectrum in vacuum for @xmath132 . in principle",
    ", the magnetic field spectrum can be greater , or less , than the photon blackbody spectrum in vacuum for @xmath132 .",
    "the only manner to obtain the magnetic field spectrum is analyzing the magnetic field fluctuations from , for example , the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem_. using the _ cold plasma _ description , for example , with the cut - off @xmath133 , we find that the magnetic spectrum has more energy than the blackbody photon spectrum in vacuum .",
    "in order to extend the work of ct and have a more complete description of the plasma , we desire a model that includes thermal effects as well as collisional effects . for this , we need a kinetic description that takes into account collisions . we used the vlasov equation in first order .",
    "this equation gives collisional corrections to the vlasov equation in zero order ( collisionless case ) .",
    "it retains terms of order @xmath69 and neglects terms of higher order . as the plasma parameter",
    "@xmath69 is much less than unity ( for example , as pointed out by @xcite , in the epoch of @xmath134 in the primordial universe , @xmath135 ) , this is a good approximation , as terms of higher order are much smaller . as noted",
    "before , the term on the right hand side of equation ( 2.14 ) , @xmath136 , is the _ collision term_. obtaining @xmath136 is a matter of great difficulty and different forms are required for various types of collisions , such as electron - electron , electron - neutral molecule , etc .",
    "most of the expressions for @xmath136 involve integral functionals of the distribution function @xmath137 .",
    "the basic difficulty in taking into account the effect of collisions lies in the complexity of the solution of the kinetic equation when the correct collision integral is used .",
    "the problem can be simplified if a _ model _ collision term is used , that is , an approximate expression .",
    "the boltzmann collision term takes into account all the possible binary collisions which the particle under observation might suffer .",
    "it is applied to weakly ionized plasma , when the scattering of charged particles by neutrals is predominant . in a fully ionized plasma ( as in our case ) , the collisions are not predominantly binary and @xmath136 for a _",
    "test _ particle does not derive mainly from the possibility that other particles approach very closely and abruptly deflect it .",
    "the cumulative effect of more distant particles is more important .",
    "the charged particles simultaneously interact with all the other particles in the debye sphere , which is a large number .",
    "the fokker - planck collision term is appropriate for a fully ionized plasma .",
    "it is based in the notion that a large - angle deflection of a particle by collisions is produced more rapidly by a succession of small - angle scattering with distant particles .",
    "it takes into account the effect of microscopic fields produced by all the other particles in the plasma .",
    "particle then is subject to simultaneously `` grazing '' collisions and its progress in velocity space becomes a random walk .",
    "we used the bgk collision term as a rough guide to the inclusion of collisions in the plasma .",
    "bgk is a _ model _ equation of the boltzmann collision term .",
    "( for a derivation see clemnow et al .",
    "@xcite and alexandrov et al .",
    "@xcite . ) as ct , we are then only treating binary collisions .",
    "( concerning this collision term , see for example the work of sitenko and gurin @xcite , who studied the effect of an effective binary collision frequency on the fluctuations in a plasma ) .",
    "a more complete treatment using the fokker - planck collision term is necessary .",
    "however , due to its complexity , as it involves integral functionals of the distribution function @xmath137 , the kinetic equations are extremely difficult to solve .",
    "we used as an effective collision frequency , the coulomb collision frequency as ct .",
    "the bgk collision term conserves the number of particles .",
    "the universe at high temperatures , at the beginning of the nucleosynthesis ( @xmath138 ) is an electron - positron plasma . as it cools down ( @xmath139 ) the electron and positrons start to annihilate and finally , at low temperatures , the plasma is reduced to a plasma of protons and electrons .",
    "let us see , if this is a good approximation in the early universe .",
    "the rate of annihilation is given by @xmath140 , where @xmath65 is the density , @xmath26 the average velocity and @xmath141 the average cross section .",

    "( as in our case , when the collision frequency is much less than the plasma frequency , the collision time is the dominant time for the kinetic processes . ) at low temperatures , an electron - proton plasma has to be considered .",
    "we note that because the electron - positron plasma strictly does not conserve the particle number due to annihilation and creation , there may not be a great advantage of using the bgk collision term , although the above paragraph indicates that the annhilation frequency is very much smaller than the collision frequency .    the plasma , in the epoch of primordial nucleosynthesis , is almost collisionless .",
    "( for example , for @xmath103 , @xmath154 . )",
    "therefore , a possible procedure that one might think of is to expand the dielectric permittivity in terms of @xmath155 . however , we are interested in the spectrum for all frequencies , even @xmath123 , and no matter how small @xmath25 is , we require frequencies with @xmath156 . thus an expansion in @xmath155 can not be made .",

    "the term of the imaginary part , connected with the collisional damping , is not set to zero .",
    "as photons have phase velocities greater than the speed of light ( @xmath177 ) , the cherenkov emission can not produce the photons . in a _ pure collisionless _",
    "treatment , the imaginary part has to be set to zero in the regime of @xmath182 . in this case",
    ", no photons are produced and the treatment is unrealistic . in our model , which includes collisions and thermal effects ,",
    "only the term connected with the cherenkov emission has to be set to zero . in this treatment",
    "we ensure that the photons are produced only by collisions , that is , by bremsstrahlung ( free - free ) emission .",
    "therefore , by forcing the cherenkov emission in the imaginary part to be zero in the regime of @xmath177 , we ensure that no spurious effects contaminate the result .",
    "we do this not only in the regime of photons @xmath183 , but for all frequencies .",
    "that is , cherenkov emission of magnetic fluctuations occur only in physical regimes , i.e. , for @xmath184 .",
    "it is left for a future study a fully relativistic treatment ( needed for the primordial universe at high temperatures ) . there",
    ", the imaginary parts of the dielectric permittivities are zero for @xmath185 , where @xmath186 , when @xmath187 and @xmath188 are imaginary .    in principle , the fact that the term connected with the cherenkov emission , for @xmath177 is forced to be zero , could be troublesome .",
    "this procedure , however , did not change appreciably the results .",
    "for example , the change of the intensity of the magnetic field fluctuations @xmath189 ( after integrating on wave number ) for @xmath190 , @xmath87 is : @xmath191 , @xmath192 and @xmath193 for @xmath194 and @xmath195 , respectively .",
    "the change is the difference between @xmath196 and @xmath197 , where @xmath198 is the term in the imaginary part of the transverse dielectric permittivity connected with cherenkov emission .    before we go on , it is interesting to comment and emphasize that both the _ cold plasma _ description and the _ warm plasma _",
    "collisionless description are particular solutions of this model .",
    "let us consider , as ct did , an electron - positron plasma .",
    "for @xmath199 , where @xmath200 , we expect to obtain the _ cold plasma _ approximation . in the limit of @xmath199 , @xmath201 .",
    "the last term is due to cherenkov emission , but as we noted before , in this limit this is a spurious solution and we need to set it to zero . taking only the first term , and substituting in eq .",
    "( [ etw ] ) , we obtain the _ cold plasma _ dielectric permittivity , as expected .    the _ warm plasma _",
    "collisionless description is obtained by setting @xmath51 . in this limit , if we write @xmath202 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 ( @xmath205 ) , eq .",
    "( [ etw ] ) is equal to the _ warm plasma _",
    "collisionless dielectric permittivity , as expected .",
    "we substitute the dielectric permittivity eq .",
    "( [ etw ] ) in eq .",
    "( [ magn ] ) obtaining the magnetic field spectrum @xmath44 . here",
    ", a divergence at high wave numbers also occurs .",
    "let us discuss this in detail .",
    "our model uses a kinetic theory description with a model collision term that describes the binary collisions in the plasma . in our case",
    ", a cut - off has to be taken , since for very small distances the energy of the coulomb interactions of the particles exceeds their kinetic energy which violates the applicability of the condition of the perturbation expansion ( in the plasma parameter @xmath96 ) .",
    "this occurs approximately for distances @xmath97 , or more exactly , the distance of closest approach between a test particle and an electron in a plasma , @xmath98 , where @xmath99 , @xmath26 and @xmath100 are respectively , the mass , velocity and charge of the test particle @xcite .    the cut - off procedure can only be removed , treating properly the effects of distant encounters .",
    "this can be done with the fokker - planck collision term .",
    "thompson and hubbard , and hubbard in several works @xcite , analyzed the fokker - planck equation and its coefficients .",
    "the diffusion and friction coefficients that appear in the fokker - planck equation , take into account correlation effects between distant particles in the plasma .",
    "when higher order terms in the fokker - planck equation are calculated and summed , a term resembling the boltzmann collision term is obtained . in their treatment , they showed that the cut - off procedure is unnecessary .",
    "however , due to the complexity of the solution of the kinetic equation with the fokker - planck collision term , we used the bgk collision term . with this model collision term",
    ", a cut - off is necessary and we chose @xmath206 consistent with this model collision term .",
    "a more exact treatment , however , is needed .    in figure",
    "4a we plot the magnetic field spectrum @xmath207 ( divided by the normalization @xmath89 ) vs @xmath118 for an electron - positron plasma at @xmath190 and @xmath208 .",
    "the dotted curve is our model and we compare it with the blackbody spectrum in vacuum ( the solid curve ) . in figure 4b , we extend the curves to high frequencies , showing the behaviour of the blackbody at high frequencies . figures 4c and 4d are for an electron - proton plasma , with @xmath209 and @xmath91 .    as we commented before ( section [ sec : dis ] ) , the results are very dependent on the cut - off chosen . using @xmath206 as the cut - off , we obtain results that differ from the ct results : first , the peak intensity found by them for frequencies @xmath123 decreases .",
    "this is due to the kinetic plasma effects that smear out the peak .",
    "however , it is interesting to see that qualitative agreement between the work of ct and ours exist with respect to the zero frequency peak ; second , we obtain the blackbody naturally for high frequencies ; and third , the magnetic field spectrum has more energy than the blackbody spectrum for frequencies @xmath210 .",
    "the magnetic field spectrum can be deduced from the fluctuations of the magnetic field described by the _ fluctuation- dissipation theorem _ and it is highly dependent on the way the plasma is described .",
    "we discussed the _ cold plasma _ description and the _ warm plasma _ description in the collisionless case studied by ct .",
    "we showed that @xmath115 is much smaller than @xmath206 and @xmath211 , where @xmath212 used in sec .",
    "vii of ct ( arguing that for @xmath213 the plasma has a negligble effect ) .",
    "@xmath206 is the cut - off used in treating binary collisions , @xmath214 being the distance of closest approach between a test particle and an electron in a plasma ( divided by @xmath215 ) .",
    "we also showed that the _ fluctuation - dissipation theorem _ contains the eigenfrequencies of the plasma ( in the transverse case ) , the photons . using the _ cold plasma _ description with the upper limit @xmath116",
    ", we obtain the blackbody spectrum at high frequencies naturally , without the necessity of a _ link _ procedure used by ct . for this case",
    ", the valley disappears and the curve is above the blackbody spectrum in vacuum .",
    "the manner to obtain the entire magnetic field spectrum is analyzing the magnetic field fluctuations .",
    "this is the only way to obtain information , not only about modes that propagate ( i.e. , photons ) , but also modes that do not propagate .",
    "the modes that do not propagate appear not only at low frequencies but also at high frequencies due to the correlations in the plasma . only at very high frequencies does the photon contribution dominate the magnetic field spectrum .",
    "the argument used by ct , that the energy under the peak is almost equal to the energy `` stolen '' by the plasma cut - off effect of the blackbody in vacuum , is incorrect .",
    "there is no reason why we have to have the same energy as the blackbody spectrum in vacuum for photons for @xmath216 , since the photons have a different dispersion relation than the fluctuations in the plasma .",
    "in fact , using a upper limit @xmath116 in the _ cold plasma _ description , for example , the spectrum obtained is above the blackbody spectrum in vacuum .",
    "the reason why the collective modes of the plasma can have more energy for @xmath217 than the photons in vacuum , can be understood as follows .",
    "photons are massless bosons with the dispersion relation @xmath218 . for the energy interval , @xmath219 ,",
    "the wave number interval is @xmath220 to @xmath45 equal to @xmath221 .",
    "a relatively small amount of phase space is involved . for the collective motions of the plasma , in general",
    ", we have a larger amount of phase space .",
    "for example , for plasmons with energy @xmath222 , the amount of phase space extends to a maximum @xmath45 of @xmath223 , which is greater than @xmath221 for the photons . in general , for a given frequency for @xmath132 , the greater phase available to the collective modes of the plasma ( than that of the photons ) implies more energy , or a higher spectrum .",
    "we presented a model that incorporates , in the same description , thermal and collisional effects .",
    "we used the vlasov equation with the bgk collision term .",
    "this collision term describes the binary collisions in the plasma .",
    "a model that takes into account collisions in a more complete way is necessary . for a fully ionized plasma",
    "it is necessary to use the fokker - planck collision term that takes into account the effect of the microscopic fields . due to the complexity of the solution of the kinetic equation with such a collision term",
    ", we used the bgk collision term .",
    "this model , an extention of the ct model , describes the basic features of a kinetic description .    as we noted before ,",
    "the results are very dependent on the cut - off chosen . using @xmath206 as the cut - off , consistent with the collision term used , we obtain results that differ from the ct results .",
    "the final magnetic spectrum of a non - magnetized plasma in thermal equilibrium has the following characteristics : a ) the peak intensity found by ct for frequencies @xmath123 decreases ; b ) the blackbody is obtained naturally for high frequencies ; and c ) the magnetic spectrum has more energy than the blackbody photon spectrum in vacuum , in particular , for frequencies , @xmath0 , where @xmath1 is the electron plasma frequency .      the authors would like to thank swadesh mahajan for useful suggestions , especially concerning the bgk collision term .",
