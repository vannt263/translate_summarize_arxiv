    "in a previous work we analyzed and investigated numerically the critical region of the hierarchical reference theory ( hrt ) for fluids , lattice gases and ising spins @xcite .",
    "the hrt was introduced by parola and reatto as a new and accurate method to evaluate the equation of state of fluids @xcite .",
    "the hrt was inspired by the renormalization group that was developed by wilson and kogut @xcite . by numerical work",
    "it was found that the hrt gave very accurate results for the equation of state for continuum fluids .",
    "especially , the critical region could be described well , and very good results for critical properties were obtained @xcite .    another accurate method to obtain the equation of state is the self - consistent ornstein - zernike approximation ( scoza ) developed by hye and stell @xcite . with scoza",
    "the correlation function is assumed to be of the ornstein - zernike form @xcite that contains a free parameter to be determined by thermodynamic self - consistency such that the equation of state becomes the same both via the energy and compressibility routes .",
    "the hrt also uses the ornstein - zernike form with a free parameter with a corresponding self - consistency between a free energy expression and compressibility .",
    "the main difference between the hrt and the scoza is that the former adds smaller and smaller wave vectors to the perturbing interaction while the latter adds strength to it by lowering the temperature .",
    "it can be noted that the ornstein - zernike form also is the leading perturbing contribution to the correlation function by @xmath4-ordering where @xmath4 is the inverse range of interaction @xcite .    due to common features of hrt and",
    "scoza a unification of these theories was initiated by reiner and hye @xcite .",
    "they considered the mean spherical model ( msm ) and a generalized version of it , the generalized msm ( gmsm ) where the exact solution was found by both the hrt and scoza by use of one free parameter @xcite .",
    "these models are precisely the @xmath2 case of the @xmath0-dimensional spins to be considered in this work . however , for the usual @xmath1 case the correlation function of ornstein - zernike form will have two free parameters to be determined self - consistently . by the unification it was found that the resulting problem was essentially a sum of the hrt and scoza problems .",
    "analysis of the unified problem was initiated by one of the authors @xcite .",
    "earlier it was found from numerical work that scoza alone resulted in a generalized scaling with different critical indices for super- and subcritical temperatures @xcite . by analytic evaluations",
    "it was confirmed that the scoza critical indices were simple rational numbers @xcite .",
    "the hrt , however , lead to usual scaling , but from numerical evaluations critical indices seemed to vary somewhat ( except for the index of the critical isotherm , @xmath5 , that follows from the given interaction ) .",
    "this variation seemed to depend upon whether a sharp or smooth cut - off was used when adding wave vectors to the interaction @xcite . with the unified problem",
    "there would be reason to expect that the different behaviors of these two theories might be straightened out .    by the analysis performed in ref .",
    "@xcite it was found that the hrt part of the unified problem would dominate close to the critical point . but despite this it turned out that hrt somehow had to reconcile with scoza properties whose generalized scaling was tied to a connection between leading and subleading contributions to the critical isotherm .",
    "this situation is also present for the msm and the gmsm .",
    "these contributions represent the connection to the mean field boundary conditions away from the critical point .",
    "it was justified by the analysis , that the critical isotherm of the hrt also should have the same subleading contribution . moreover , in order to obtain full scaling , instead of generalized scaling , it was concluded that hrt should also produce an additional intermediate contribution .",
    "the leading and the two subleading levels of contributions were further connected via thermodynamic self - consistency .",
    "this leads to simple rational numbers for the critical indices .    in recent work",
    "the authors performed further analysis and numerical work , restricted to supercritical temperatures , so as to reveal the critical properties of the hrt for @xmath1 @xcite . within numerical accuracy , the properties of the hrt mentioned above",
    "were confirmed with the conclusion that the critical indices in standard notation for 3 dimensions are @xmath6 , @xmath5 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "this seems to disagree with previous evaluations of hrt that numerically gave somewhat different numbers @xcite .",
    "however , in view of our analysis we see this differently . a crucial reason for different numbers for the critical indices is the assumed form of the the critical behavior .",
    "the usual assumption of a scaling behavior expressed by one power law gives one result while our analysis shows a structure of a leading level and two levels of subleading scaling functions of importance .",
    "our numerical results that fit accurately into these functions , confirm this structure of the hrt in the critical region .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was noted that the hrt in the critical region becomes equivalent to a renormalization group generator that has been studied earlier @xcite .",
    "thus our results may imply that the renormalization procedure more generally also can be expected to contain the hrt structure of leading and subleading contributions .    as argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , it is not ruled out that these are the exact indices for fluids and ising spins in 3 dimensions apart from corrections of logarithmic type ( see secs .  x and xi of ref .",
    "@xcite where arguments and explanations are given in some detail ) .",
    "this , however , is at variance with known epsilon - expansion results @xcite where estimates are @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "a series of similar results for the critical indices are given in table 6 of ref .",
    "again this disagreement may be similar to the one with hrt .",
    "the presence of leading and subleading levels of scaling functions that are connected , may also here lead to simple rational numbers for the critical indices .",
    "however , this conjecture will not be investigated further here .",
    "so in this respect our results are restricted to the hrt . from our results below",
    "we find reason to extend the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite to @xmath16 too .    in the present work",
    "we want to extend the hrt to d - dimensional spins , i.e.  the spin dimensionality is @xmath0 while the spatial dimension is still 3 . for this case the spin - spin interaction will have the spherical symmetry of @xmath0 dimensions , and the order parameter",
    "will be a @xmath0-dimensional vector . for @xmath17",
    "this is the classical heisenberg model .",
    "earlier the scoza was extended to d - dimensional spins @xcite . by combining this with",
    "the unified problem for @xmath1 studied in refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite we find it rather obvious how the dominating contribution to hrt in the critical region can be generalized to @xmath16 .",
    "the resulting equation will contain a combination of terms for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 cases .",
    "such an extension of hrt has recently also been performed by parola and reatto @xcite .    the type of analysis and numerical work of ref .",
    "@xcite can be extended to this more general situation .",
    "the results we find from this study for supercritical temperatures , will show that the critical indices do not vary with @xmath0 .",
    "again this is not in agreement with the results already found for hrt in table 2 of ref .",
    "@xcite where it is found that the hrt critical index @xmath18 varies with @xmath0 .",
    "this disagreement may again in our opinion be related to the assumed type of power law behavior in the critical region as mentioned above .",
    "this is clearly demonstrated by the difference in conclusions that can be drawn from our figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and [ fig5 ] below .",
    "also this is not in agreement with @xmath19 or @xmath20 expansions of critical indices @xcite .",
    "however , for large @xmath0 we find that there will be a rapid crossover to the msm ( @xmath2 ) behavior away from the critical point .",
    "this can be regarded as having effective critical indices that vary with @xmath0 .",
    "but the question about the exact critical behavior of @xmath0-dimensional spins is separate from the solution of its hrt problem , and it will , as mentioned above , not be investigated further here .",
    "so in this respect our results are limited to the critical properties of the hrt for such spins .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we establish the hrt partial differential equation for d - dimensional spins in the critical region .",
    "this equation is a generalization that combines the @xmath2 case considered in ref .",
    "@xcite and the @xmath1 case of refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "this is the equation to be analyzed and numerically solved .    in sec  [ sec3 ] the unified hrt and scoza problems",
    "are considered . as",
    "only terms dominant in the critical region are kept , this results in the hrt equation of sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] and a scoza equation modified by a parameter @xmath18 . by combining these two equations along with the internal energy expression an equation that reveals key properties of @xmath18 ,",
    "is obtained .",
    "further we find that these properties also must be present in the hrt .    in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] it is noted that for a suitable , and perhaps somewhat artificial , choice of the cut - off function @xmath21 for wave vectors , the parameter @xmath18 will be a constant that can be put equal to zero .",
    "the consequence of this choice is that hrt and scoza both will have the same solution and thus the same critical properties where generalized scaling is present @xcite . for this case",
    "the explicit solution for both the leading scaling function ( fixed point solution ) and the subleading contribution are found .",
    "the reason to study this special case is to have an explicit analytic solution to better understand the general situation where the intermediate scaling contribution will show up to enable standard scaling .    in sec .",
    "[ sec5 ] we present a brief sketch of the numerical approach and analyze the numerical results . here",
    "the cut - off function @xmath21 will have a more general form such that the hrt and scoza solutions do no longer coincide , i.e.  @xmath18 will vary .",
    "by that the hrt will have an intermediate subleading contribution that is non - zero .    finally , in sec .  [ sec6 ]",
    "the critical properties are considered in view of the properties of the parameter @xmath18 found in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . then by comparing the powers of the leading and the two subleading contributions to thermodynamic quantities",
    ", one finds that they are linked together . in this way",
    "definite values for the critical indices are obtained .",
    "in this work we want to study the critical properties of an extension of the hrt to d - dimensional spins .",
    "as other details are not sought for , the hrt equation can be established on a simplified form in a straightforward way . for @xmath1 ( fluids and ising spins ) this simplified equation , which follows from eq .",
    "( [ 100 ] ) below , becomes eq .",

    "a detailed description of the role played by smooth and sharp cutoff in the hrt approach can be found in ref .",
    "since we focus upon critical properties , the scaling form ( [ 22 ] ) will be kept for all @xmath25 ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "eq.([21 ] ) follows from the change in free energy @xmath33 when adding wave vectors in the interval @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) to the perturbing interaction whose fourier transform is @xmath36 @xmath37 with normalization @xmath38 the @xmath39 .",

    "so we will consider the unified hrt and scoza problem and utilize scoza properties .",

    "in addition the @xmath86 contains @xmath18 . but according to the discussion below eq .",
    "( [ 39 ] ) the @xmath18 can only contain the scaling terms of @xmath23 by which the @xmath18 will not modify eq .",

    "it must be concluded that @xmath281 ( in eq .",
