    "the group @xmath10 acts on this space as follows : @xmath11 the action is transitive for @xmath12 . let @xmath5 be a lattice in @xmath10 ; that is , a discrete subgroup in @xmath10 such that the factor space @xmath13 has finite volume ( e.g. @xmath14 ) . the main result of this paper concerns distribution of @xmath5-orbits in @xmath1 .    when @xmath15 , every orbit of @xmath5 is discrete",
    "the situation becomes much more interesting for @xmath12 .",
    "let us recall known results :    * ( dani , raghavan @xcite ) * [ th_dr ] let @xmath14 , and @xmath16 be an @xmath2-frame in @xmath3 , @xmath4 . then the orbit @xmath17 is dense in @xmath1 iff the space spanned by @xmath18 contains no nonzero rational vectors .    *",
    "( veech @xcite ) * [ th_ve ] if @xmath5 is a cocompact lattice in @xmath10 , then every orbit of @xmath5 in @xmath1 , @xmath4 , is dense .",
    "theorems [ th_dr ] and [ th_ve ] provide examples of dense @xmath5-orbits in @xmath1 . here",
    "we show that dense @xmath5-orbits are uniformly distributed with respect to an explicitly described measure on @xmath1 .",
    "this measure is @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath21 , and @xmath22 is the @xmath2-dimensional volume of the frame @xmath23 .",
    "note that the measure @xmath20 is @xmath10-invariant , and it is unique up to a constant .",
    "however , orbits of @xmath5 are equidistributed with respect to the measure @xmath19 , which is not @xmath10-invariant",
    ". this phenomenon was already observed by ledrappier @xcite .",
    "define a norm on @xmath24 by @xmath25 for @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , put @xmath29 we determine asymptotic behavior of @xmath30 as @xmath31 .",
    "this result gives a quantitative strengthening of theorems [ th_dr ] and [ th_ve ] , and it can be interpreted as uniform distribution of dense orbits of @xmath5 in @xmath1 .",

    "the term @xmath41 in ( [ eq_f_main00 ] ) comes from the asymptotics of the volume of the set @xmath42 in the stabilizer @xmath43 of @xmath44 with respect to the measure on @xmath43 which is determined by the choice of the haar measures on @xmath10 and @xmath45 ( see section [ sec_ttt ] ) .    for @xmath46 and @xmath47 ,",
    "this theorem was proved by ledrappier @xcite for general @xmath5 and by nogueira @xcite for @xmath48 and @xmath49-norm using different methods .",
    "combining theorems [ th_dr ] and [ th_frames00 ] , we get :    [ th_frames ] let @xmath14 .",
    "let @xmath50 be an @xmath2-frame in @xmath3 such that the space @xmath51 contains no nonzero rational vectors .",

    "[ pic1 ]        dani and raghavan also considered orbits of frames under @xmath58 . denote @xmath59 j= (    [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     ) , @xmath59 and @xmath60 is a continuous function depending only on the @xmath61-components of @xmath62 .",
    "we can use proposition [ pro_assym ] with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 .",
    "since @xmath34 is dense in @xmath66 , @xmath67 is dense in @xmath10 . by ( [ eq_last ] )",

    "thus , by ( [ eq_last ] ) , @xmath71 where @xmath72",
    "to find the constant @xmath73 , we calculate measures of the set @xmath74 denote by @xmath75 the lebesgue measure of a @xmath76-dimensional unit ball . recall that @xmath77 clearly , @xmath78 for @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 , @xmath82 iff @xmath83 for @xmath84 .",

    "finally , by ( [ eq_vol1 ] ) and ( [ eq_vol2 ] ) , @xmath94    let @xmath95 for @xmath96 , and @xmath97 for @xmath98 , define @xmath99 note that @xmath100 .",
    "thus , it is enough to compute asymptotics of the function @xmath101 as @xmath102 . by tauberian theorem (",
    "v , theorem  4.3 ) , it can be deduced from asymptotics of the function @xmath103 as @xmath104 .",
    "it is more convenient to work with the function @xmath105 let @xmath106 .",
    "one can check that @xmath107 for @xmath108 .",
    "( in fact , each of the integral defines a right haar measure on @xmath109 . )",
    "consider mellin transform of the function @xmath110 : @xmath111 using that @xmath112 , we get @xmath113 making substitution @xmath114 , we get @xmath115 by mellin inversion formula , for sufficiently large @xmath116 , @xmath117 since @xmath5-function decays fast on vertical strips , we can shift the line of integration to the left . by ( [ eq_fz ] )",
    ", the first pole of @xmath118 occurs at @xmath119 .",
    "therefore , it follows from ( [ eq_fff ] ) that @xmath120 by ( [ eq_psi2 ] ) , @xmath121 finally , the asymptotic estimate for @xmath122 as @xmath102 follows from tauberian theorem ( * ? ? ? * ch .",

    "we have @xmath123 this proves the lemma .",
    "note that @xmath127 we use the formula ( [ eq_rho_l ] ) for @xmath128 and make the change of variables @xmath129 for @xmath130 .",
    "the formula ( [ eq_rbtc ] ) follows from the fact that the volume of a unit ball in @xmath131 is @xmath132 .    for @xmath133 ,",
