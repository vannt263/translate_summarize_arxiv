    "recently , the cleo collaboration reported the observation of some nonleptonic @xmath1 meson decays into two light pseudoscalar mesons with the following branching ratios @xcite : @xmath4 and the upper limits of the branching ratios for other decay modes were of the order of @xmath5 .",
    "these measurements at cleo and the future experiments at b - factories motivate a great deal of theoretical interests in nonleptonic @xmath1 decays into two light mesons @xcite .    the standard theoretical framework to study non - leptonic @xmath1 decays is based on the effective hamiltonian approach .",
    "the short and long distance qcd effects in the non - leptonic weak decays are separated by means of the operator product expansion@xcite .",
    "the resulting effective hamiltonian consists of products of scale - dependent wilson coefficients @xmath6 and the local four - quark operators at the renormalization scale @xmath7 .",
    "the short distance contributions of the coefficients @xmath6 has been evaluated up to the next - to - leading logarithmic ( nll ) order @xcite . in the nll precision ,",
    "the wilson coefficients depend on the renormalization scheme as well as renormalization scale .",
    "these dependences should be canceled by corresponding scheme / scale dependence of the matrix element of the operators .",
    "however , hadronic matrix elements are usually calculated under the factorization approximation in which they are replaced by the scale / scheme independent form factors and decay constants . in order to achieve the scale / scheme independence of the matrix elements of the effective hamiltonian , ali and greub @xcite included the corrections of the one - loop penguin - like diagrams and some process independent part of the vertex corrections associated with the four - fermi operators to the partonic matrix elements before doing factorization step .",
    "they also have taken into account the effects of the @xmath8 tree - level matrix element associated with the chromomagnetic dipole operator .",
    "such corrections compensate the scale / scheme dependences of the wilson coefficients and one finally get the effective hamiltonian involving the scale / scheme independent wilson coefficients and four - quark operator .",
    "the factorization method is successful to describe the heavy - to - heavy nonleptonic decays @xcite . the intuitive argument for the factorization",
    "is given by bjorken @xcite based on the idea of color transparency .",
    "the quark pairs with high energy coming from the heavy meson decay hadronize after they have traveled some distance from each other .",
    "hence the decay process is expected to factorize into the color singlet current pairs since soft gluon effects are small after the hadronization occurs .",
    "there is more theoretical argument about the factorization based on qcd . in the specific kinematic region",
    "in which the two light quarks are highly collinear and all quarks are almost on - shell , the leading term of the green function in expansion of inverse powers of the heavy quark masses and the large energy transferred to the light quark pairs exhibits factorization @xcite .",
    "the authors in ref .",
    "@xcite extended this framework to the heavy - to - light transitions .",
    "they also introduce a new free parameter @xmath9 that describes nonfactorization effects such as color octet contributions and concluded that the range @xmath10 is consistent with data @xcite .",
    "however one should keep in mind that the factorization for the heavy - to - light transition is still only a model to describe the complex hadronic matrix elements since there is no theoretical justification as the heavy - to - heavy transition case @xcite . in principle",
    "there is no reason that only one single value of the parameter @xmath9 can explain the branching ratios of all kind of different modes .",
    "for example , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite introduce two different @xmath9 s corresponding to the different currents structures which give different nonfactorization corrections .",
    "however , we will use the factorization method including one nonfactorization parameter @xmath9 in this work .    on the other hand ,",
    "there are some possible anomalies in the inclusive @xmath1 decays .",
    "the persistent discrepancy of the measurements of the semileptonic branching ratio and charm multiplicity with the theoretical predictions have been known quite for a while @xcite .",
    "one can argue that these problems arise because of the breakdown of local quark - hadron duality that was invoked when one estimates the nonleptonic @xmath1 decay rate .",
    "however , several authors have noticed that these puzzles can be solved if one assumes that the wilson coefficient of the chromomagnetic operator is enhanced by some new physics contributions @xcite . incidentally",
    ", this may help to understand the recently measured branching ratio for @xmath11 , which is surprisingly larger than previously expected .",
    "such an enhanced @xmath2 should affect inevitably the exclusive decay rates of @xmath1 mesons , and it is one of the main themes of our present work to study such effects .",
    "in this work , we consider the nonleptonic @xmath1 decays into two light pseudoscalar mesons and investigate the possible effects through the enhanced chromomagnetic dipole contribution .",
    "the branching ratios are calculated by the generalized factorization method proposed in ref .",
    "the qcd and ew penguin contributions are included in this work .",
    "the two - angle mixing formalisms are used in the calculation of the decay rates involving @xmath12 mesons , and the amplitudes @xmath13 @xcite are included using the qcd anomaly , instead of the intrinsic charm contents of @xmath14 .",
    "we also study the cp asymmetry in @xmath1 meson decays , both the direct @xmath0 asymmetries of charged @xmath1 meson decays and the time integrated @xmath0 asymmetries of neutral @xmath1 meson decays . in this calculation",
    ", we assume that the strong phases are given by the penguin - type diagrams with internal light quarks which could have on - shell momentum @xcite .",

    "the @xmath20 and @xmath21 are called the gluonic and electroweak penguin operators respectively , and @xmath22 is the gluonic dipole moment operator .",
    "the subscripts @xmath23 represent the projection operators @xmath24 onto left- and right - handed spinor and @xmath25 indicates the electromagnetic charge of the corresponding quarks .",
    "the subindex @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the @xmath28 color indices and @xmath29 are the gell - mann matrices .    if we take @xmath30 gev , @xmath31 , we have the following numerical values of the wilson coefficients at the renormalization scale @xmath32 gev in the naive dimensional renormalization scheme @xcite : @xmath33 where the wilson coefficients @xmath34 are taken as the nll values with respect to qcd .",
    "the values of the remaining coefficients are given at the leading logarithmic precision .",
    "in the nll precision , the matrix elements of local 4-fermion operators @xmath35 s are to be treated at the one - loop level . in ref.@xcite , the contributions arising from the penguin - type diagram of the operators @xmath36 and",
    "the tree - level diagram of the dipole operator @xmath22 have been calculated and absorbed into the effective wilson coefficients @xmath37 .",
    "the process - independent contributions from the vertex - type diagrams are also considered .",
    "these full nll considerations are sufficient to compensate the scale and scheme dependence arising from the factorization approximation and the resulting effective wilson coefficients are given in ref.@xcite .",
    "in this paper , we use the factorization approximation in order to calculate the hadronic matrix elements of the type @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is a light pseudoscalar meson . in this approximation",

    "we choose the nemerical values of the relevant decay constants , @xmath47 as follows : @xmath48 the values of form factors at @xmath49 is required for the calculation of decay rate . as the final states involve only light hadrons we can safely neglect the @xmath50 dependence of form factors .",
