    "since the beginning of the last century the non - homogeneous spatial properties of solar activity have been studied extensively @xcite . these early investigations conjectured initially that the longitudinal distribution of sunspot groups or sunspot numbers shows non - homogeneous behaviour .",
    "these analyses concluded that there are preferred longitudes , where solar activity concentrates .",
    "later , different approximations and assumptions were applied to understand the essence of this phenomenon .",
    "the topic soon became controversial ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "overall , three approaches can be distinguished .",
    "the first approach is the quasi - rigid structure model by @xcite .",
    "this model describes a constantly rotating frame which carries the persistent domains of activity @xcite .",
    "@xcite applied an autocorrelation statistical method based on long - term sunspot number data .",
    "@xcite applied period - analysis to the greenwich photoheliographics results ( gpr ) .",
    "these studies concluded that the angular velocity of the quasi - rigid rotating frame varies .",
    "the angular velocity depends on the solar cycle , but during one cycle the angular velocity is constant .    the second approach , promoted by e.g. @xcite and @xcite discovered the active nest and defined it as a small and isolated area on the solar surface . here , the enhanced longitudinal activities are considered as individual entities .",
    "these isolated entities can be absent for several rotations .",
    "the third group of models assumes a migrating activity in the carrington coordinate system .",
    "@xcite found persistent als under the influence of the differential rotation . @xcite and @xcite introduced a dynamic reference frame. this frame describes the longitudinal migration of active longitude in carrington coordinate system and the frame has a similar dynamics to differential rotation .",
    "@xcite concluded that the migration of the enhanced activity is just apparent . in the dynamic reference frame ,",
    "the rotation of the active longitude remains constant and the active longitude itself is a persistent quasi - rigidly rotating phenomenon .",
    "@xcite proposed that a seemingly migrating al may occur as a result of interaction between the equatorward propagating dynamo wave and a quasi - rigidly rotating non - axisymmetric active zone .",
    "the role of differential rotation is also controversy .",
    "various studies concluded that the differential rotation is not the reason of the migration of the al @xcite .    in our previous work ( i.e. @xcite , hereafter gy16 ) , we found evidence supporting the third group of models . moreover , the migration of als does not appear to correspond very well to the form of the 11-year cycle as suggested by previous studies @xcite .",
    "the half - width of the active longitudinal belt is fairly narrow during moderate activity but is wider at maximum activity .",
    "we also found that the al is not always identifiable .",
    "several studies @xcite suggested that the spatial distributions of eruptive solar phenomena also show non - axisymmetric properties .",
    "@xcite analysed the coordinates of energetic solar flares based of 5 years of time period and concluded that longitudinal spatial distribution is non - homogeneous .",
    "@xcite concluded that the dominant and co - dominant al contains 80% of c- and x - flares . in gy16",
    ", we conducted a similar study based on four solar cycles and we did not find significant co - dominant activity ; instead , we found that only the dominant al contains 60% of the solar flares .",
    "the flares and cmes could occur independently of each other .",
    "numerous cmes have associated flares but several non - flaring filament lift - offs also lead to cme @xcite .",
    "furthermore , in the case of the stealth cmes there are no easily identifiable signatures to locate the source of the eruption on the solar surface @xcite . hence , separate flare - cme spatial distribution investigations are justified .",
    "we used the soho / lasco halo cme catalog by the http://cdaw.gsfc.nasa.gov/cme_list/halo/halo.html[cdaw data centre ] .",
    "the cme catalog spans over 20 years , i.e. between 1996 and 2016 .",
    "this is the most extensive catalog that contains the source location of cmes .",
    "only halo cmes are reported , i.e. their angular width is 360 degrees in c3 coronagraph field of view .",
    "@xcite describes the catalog in great details .",
    "the cme source is defined as the centre of the associated active region .",
    "the source of the cme is identified using soho eit running difference images .",
    "later , the ability of the stereo mission to observe the backside of sun was used to identify the source of back - sided halo cmes @xcite .",
    "this catalog also provides the space speed of cmes which is the actual speed with which the cme propagates in the interplanetary space . the plane of sky speed obtained from the single soho viewpoint , converted into space speed using the cone model @xcite .",
    "the http://fenyi.solarobs.unideb.hu/dpd/ [ debrecen photoheliographic data ] ] ( dpd ) sunspot catalogue is used for estimating the longitudinal position of the al .",
    "the catalog provides information about the date of observation , position and area for each sunspot .",
    "the precision of the position is 0.1 heliographic degrees and the estimated accuracy of the area measurement is @xmath010 percent .",
    "the first step of our identification procedure is to divide the solar surface by 18 equally sliced longitudinal belts .",
    "hence , one bin equals to a zone with @xmath1 width .",
    "we take into account all sunspot groups from the moment when they reach their maximum area .",
    "this filtering criteria is chosen for the following reasons : firstly , if we select all sunspot groups at every moment of time then the statistics will be biased by the long - lived sunspot groups .",
    "secondly , the maximum area of the sunspot groups is a well - defined and easily identifiable moment .",
    "this is different from the used practice of considering only the first appearance of each sunspot group .",
    "let us define the matrix @xmath2 by :    @xmath3    here , the area of all sunspot groups ( @xmath4 ) is summed up in each longitudinal bin for each cr .",
    "@xmath5 is divided by the summarised area over the entire solar surface ( @xmath6 ) .",
    "the range of @xmath2 must be always between @xmath7 and @xmath8 , depending on the local appearance of the activity . in the case of @xmath9 ,",
    "all of the flux emergence takes place in one single longitudinal strip .",
    "a @xmath10 significance level threshold is applied to filter the noise .",
    "moving average is also applied for data smoothing with a time - window of 3 crs .",
    "we standardised the matrix @xmath11 ( defined in eq [ w ] ) by removing the mean of the data and scaling to unit variance .",
    "then , cluster analysis was performed for grouping the obtained significant peaks . here",
    ", the dbscan clustering algorithm was chosen which is a density - based algorithm .",
    "the method groups together points that are relatively closely packed together in a high - density region and it marks outlier points that stand alone in low - density regions ( for details see @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter epsilon ( @xmath12 ) defines the maximum distance between two points to be considered to be in the same group .",
    "the parameter m ( @xmath13 ) specifies the desired minimum cluster size .",
    "clusters , containing less than three points , were omitted .",
    "the longitudinal location of the clusters ( @xmath14 ) represent the position of the al .",
    "panel @xmath15 of figure [ al ] shows an example of the initial identification steps outlined above .",
    "the sample time period covers 6 years , and it corresponds to 80 cr between @xmath16 cr and @xmath17 cr .",
    "the quantity @xmath2 is represented by the shades with blue colour .",
    "the dark blue regions denote the significance ( @xmath10 ) presence of activity .",

    "to the data panels @xmath15 and @xmath20 , we applied a polynomial least squares fitting based on multiple models .",

    "shows the best goodness of fit , hence this model is chosen .",

    "the sunspot rotation could play important role in helicity transport across the photosphere .",
    "sunspot rotation may increase helicity in the corona leading to flares and cmes @xcite .",
    "this property may also have the consequence of a more complex built - up of the underlying magnetic structure , and , the well - studied magnetic arches of the upper solar layer could be oriented at a large angle to the equator @xcite .",
    "the more complex active regions are the more flares and they will be associated with cmes @xcite .",
    "hence , we conclude that the above physical process can take place within al and anywhere else but only with low probability there .",
    "several studies have investigated east - west asymmetry of cmes occurrence .",
    "@xcite found asymmetry using data provided by the soho - lasco @xmath118 .",
    "the asymmetric behaviour could be a consequence of al .",
    "our result obtained here shows ( see e.g. fig [ cmespatial2 ] ) that the number of cme occurrence is marginally higher within al .",
    "the mean of the apparent and space velocity of cme occurrences is around @xmath119 km / s considering the entire surface of the sun .",
    "this mean velocity is known an slow cmes , found in a number of earlier studies @xcite .",

    "there is no fast cme occurrence found outside of al .",
    "therefore , interestingly and notably , the fast halo cmes are also al cmes .",
    "our new findings ( together with the results of gy16 ) could provide novel aspects both for space weather forecast and for solar dynamo theory . usually , the flare and/or cme prediction tools are based on only the behaviour of active regions , such as complexity of magnetic fields or other morphological properties .",
    "however , the spatial distribution of active regions can also assist in forecasting as suggested by e.g @xcite .",
    "we conclude , that the main source of cme and solar flare ( gy16 ) occurrences is the al .",
    "hence , the detection of this enhanced longitudinal belt may allow us to find the most flare- and cme - capable regions of the sun preceding the appearance of an active region .",
    "this potential flare and cme source is predictable even several solar rotations in advance .",
    "the observed properties of the non - axisymmetric solar activity need to be taken into account in developing and verifying suitable dynamo theory : the observations analysed here show that there is only one significant al with a relatively wide ( @xmath121 degrees ) belt .",
    "furthermore , the tilt angle of the active regions is also an important observed constraint for dynamo theory : the tilt angle of sunspot groups shows non - axisymmetric behaviour , which is a completely new ( and surprising ) finding .",

    "<S> the spatial inhomogeneity of the distribution of coronal mass ejection ( cme ) occurrences in the solar atmosphere could provide a tool to estimate the longitudinal position of the most probable cme - capable active regions in the sun . </S>",
    "<S> the anomaly in the longitudinal distribution of active regions themselves is often referred to as active longitude ( al ) . in order to reveal the connection between the al and cme spatial occurrences , here we investigate the morphological properties of active regions . </S>",
    "<S> the first morphological property studied is the separateness parameter , which is able to characterise the probability of the occurrence of an energetic event , such as solar flare or cme . </S>",
    "<S> the second morphological property is the sunspot tilt angle . </S>",
    "<S> the tilt angle of sunspot groups allows us to estimate the helicity of active regions . </S>",
    "<S> the increased helicity leads to a more complex built - up of the magnetic structure and also can cause cme eruption . </S>",
    "<S> we found that the most complex active regions appear near to the al and the al itself is associated with the most tilted active regions . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the number of cme occurrences is higher within the al . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of the fast cmes is also found to be associated with this region . </S>",
    "<S> we concluded that the source of the most probably cme - capable active regions is at the al . by applying this method </S>",
    "<S> we can potentially forecast a flare and/or cme source several carrington rotations in advance . </S>",
    "<S> this finding also provides new information for solar dynamo modelling . </S>"
