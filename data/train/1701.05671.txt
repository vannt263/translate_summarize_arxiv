    "it is generally believed that the collective behavior of coupled identical oscillators will be either synchronized or unsynchronized for local or global coupling . however , in 2002 , kuramoto and his colleagues noticed that it is also possible to observe peculiar patterns in which the oscillators separate sharply into two groups , one composed of mutually synchronized oscillators with a unique frequency and the other composed of desynchronized oscillators with distributed frequencies , provided that nonlocal coupling is adopted @xcite .",
    "the surprising aspect of this phenomenon is that it was detected in systems of identical oscillators coupled in a symmetric ring topology with a symmetric interaction function , and it coexists with a completely synchronized state .",
    "this highly counterintuitive phenomenon was then given the name chimera state ( cs ) in 2004 by abrams and strogatz @xcite .",
    "since then , css have been the focus of extensive research in a wide number of models , including neuronal systems @xcite , chaotic oscillators @xcite , high - dimensional systems @xcite , and even experimental systems @xcite . to date",
    ", css can be considered as a variety of self - organized spatiotemporal patterns in which regions of coherence and incoherence coexist .",
    "these patterns include the multicluster cs @xcite , breathing cs @xcite , spiral wave cs @xcite , circular spot cs and stripe cs @xcite , traveling cs @xcite , and chimera death @xcite .",
    "cs is applied in many realistic systems such as the unihemispheric sleep observed in birds , lizards , and dolphins @xcite ; electrical spiral and scroll waves in the context of the heart @xcite ; and epileptic seizures @xcite .    in light of the above results ,",
    "an important question becomes , `` what is the next key topic in the study of css ? '' to identify this topic , we carefully recheck the above results and find three common points : ( 1 ) most of the studies are focused on 1d arrays and consider both phase models and nonphase models , such as the complex ginzburg  landau equation and neurons .",
    "( 2 ) a few studies have extended the phenomenon of the cs to 2d arrays , but only in phase models such as kuramoto oscillators .",
    "further , ( 3 ) each model can show only one or a few types of cs patterns .",
    "from these three features , two interesting questions arise .",
    "the first is whether it is possible to extend the cs to 2d systems of nonphase models , and the second is whether it is possible to use only one system to show most of the observed cs patterns .",
    "in fact , the second question is especially important , as the synchronized or partially synchronized patterns in neural systems are closely related to the functions of the brain , such as cognitive and memory functions @xcite . if we can provide evidence proving that it is possible for one neural system to show most of the cs patterns observed to date , it will be extremely helpful for understanding the large capacity of human memory patterns , which has been understood only in terms of artificial neural networks @xcite .",
    "it is , therefore , of fundamental importance to construct a model to implement the various cs or similar patterns , collectively referred to as chimera - like patterns , which is the aim of this work .",
    "we here propose such a model of fitzhugh  nagumo ( fhn ) neurons to show that the cs can indeed be extended to 2d arrays of nonphase models and that the models do show diverse chimera - like patterns .",
    "we also find that this model can show some special chimera - like patterns such as gridding and multicolumn patterns , which were previously observed only in phase models .",
    "further , we present an effective approach to generating heterogeneous coupling , i.e. , removing some of the coupling links .",
    "we find , surprisingly , that heterogeneous coupling can result in diverse chimera - like patterns and , in particular , can cause transformations from one type of chimera - like pattern to another .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the model of 2d arrays of fhn neurons with nonlocal coupling and introduce the local order parameter to measure their collective behavior . in sec .",
    "iii , we present two methods of nonlocal coupling to generate diverse local synchronized patterns and the new patterns in our model . in sec .",
    "iv , we discuss the observed patterns and present our conclusions .",
    "we consider a model of 2d arrays of @xmath0 nonlocally coupled , identical fhn neurons with a periodic boundary condition ( the torus configuration ) .",

    "( [ model ] ) and ( [ coupling ] ) , we see that there are @xmath15 coupling links from node @xmath16 to the nodes in the coupling region , and they constitute a starlike subnetwork .",

    "we let @xmath21 be slightly smaller than @xmath22 ; i.e. , @xmath23 .    to study the collective behaviors of system ( [ model ] ) and investigate the existence of css , we introduce two quantities .",

    "@xmath29 describes the local average amplitude of the @xmath16-th fhn unit @xcite .",

    "[ fig : spots ] shows the patterns of a circular spot cs ; see its caption for details .",

    ". then we let the initial conditions and parameters be the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig : gridding](d)(f ) with @xmath71 .",
    "we find that we can still observe the pattern of three columns when @xmath72u[9,15]$ ] .",
    "[ fig : gridding1](d ) shows such a typical result with @xmath73 .",

    "fig : gridding1](e ) and ( f ) show typical results for @xmath76 and @xmath77 , respectively .",
    "we observed similar results for other cases such as the traveling wave , stripes , and circular spots and found that their patterns differ greatly from those in figs . [",
    "fig : traveling ] , [ fig : stripes ] , and [ fig : spots ] , respectively , confirming the diversity of chimera - like patterns .",
    "the second approach is to remove all the coupling links in the middle of a specific range but keep at least the nearest and farthest coupling links .",

    "we see that the remaining links are in two separate regions , and the removed links are in the range of @xmath82 $ ] , indicating that all the links in circles 2 and 3 are removed .",
    "this approach makes the coupling matrix more heterogeneous , in contrast to the first approach .    to see how changing the coupling matrix influences the chimera - like patterns , we first let the initial conditions and parameters be the same as those in fig .",

    "[ fig : gridding1 ] .",
    "we easily see that the panels in the two figures are different , indicating the diversity of the chimera - like patterns .",
    "we observed similar results for other cases such as the traveling wave , stripes , and circular spots using this approach , again confirming the diversity of patterns .",
    "the networked neural model in eq .",
    "( [ model ] ) is in fact not a phase model .",
    "compared with phase models , it contains more information , including both the aspect from phase and that from amplitude . in this sense , much more information will be transmitted by the coupling links than in a purely phase model , and thus the system will be able to show a richer variety of behavior , which is the main reason for the diversity of chimera - like patterns in a single networked neural system .",
    "a characteristic feature of eq . ( [ model ] ) is its nonlocal coupling , which is fundamentally different from both global coupling and nearest - neighbor coupling .",
    "global coupling generally induces global synchronization that is robust to slight changes in the network structure .",
    "in contrast , nearest - neighbor coupling does not easily result in global synchronization unless a sufficiently large coupling strength is used .",
    "nonlocal coupling falls between these two extremes .",
    "thus , it can not cause global synchronization but can only sustain local synchronization , which guarantees the existence of different chimera - like patterns .",
    "more importantly , we present a new way of changing the structure of coupling links , which is the guarantee of the diversity of the chimera - like patterns . unlike the use of homogeneously nonlocal coupling in a region of radius @xmath12 , removing some of the coupling links yields heterogeneously nonlocal coupling and provides more possible coupling structures , greatly increasing the diversity of the chimera - like patterns . on the other hand , this idea can be easily extended to different schemes .",
    "notice that in both cases i and ii in fig .",
    "[ fig : scheme ] , the number of coupling links remains identical for each node .",
    "therefore , an easy way to extend them is to design irregular coupling schemes in which the number of coupling links may be different for different nodes .",
    "for example , we may randomly remove some of the coupling links .",
    "in particular , we may also remove the coupling links on purpose so that the final coupling networks can meet desired criteria , such as scale - free networks or other complex networks . in this way",
    ", we may expect new chimera - like patterns .    in conclusion , we observed diverse chimera - like patterns in 2d arrays of fhn neurons with nonlocal coupling , which were previously observed only in 1d arrays or 2d arrays in phase models .",
