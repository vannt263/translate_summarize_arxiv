    "the problem of the nucleon spin structure and the peculiarities of its underlying qcd description has attracted a lot of attention over the recent years @xcite . in particular , this is due to an enormous progress in experimental studies of the spin sum rules at low momentum transfer @xmath0 , from the very accurate jefferson lab data on the lowest moment of the spin - dependent proton structure function @xmath5 and on the bjorken sum rule @xmath2 in the range @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this data provided a good testing ground for combining both the perturbative and non - perturbative qcd contributions .    theoretical description of the nucleon spin structure functions @xmath7 at large @xmath0 relies on the operator product expansion , and at moderate @xmath0 their sensitivity to the radiative and higher twist power corrections becomes significant @xcite .",
    "due to such a sensitivity the transition to the entirely non - perturbative @xmath0 region is rather cumbersome .",
    "this transition was earlier addressed in the qcd - motivated model @xcite for the @xmath0-dependence of the generalized gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule @xcite making use of the relation to the burkhardt - cottingham sume rule @xcite for the structure function @xmath8 , whose elastic contribution is the main source of a strong @xmath0-dependence , while the contribution of the transverse structure function , @xmath9 , is smooth .",
    "the successful prediction of this model was the distinct `` crossover '' point of the proton data for @xmath5 at low @xmath10 .",
    "its subsequent modification @xcite , including radiative and power qcd corrections , made the description far more accurate , which was required by the increased accuracy of the data .",
    "now we enter a new level of increasing experimental accuracy , obtained in the recently published proton jlab data @xcite .",
    "they lie above the model inputs at @xmath11 ( while displaying quite a similar shape ) due to a noticeable sensitivity of pqcd part of @xmath12 and to poorly known higher twist contributions @xmath13 , as well as the axial singlet charge @xmath14 .",
    "our present goal is to improve the model for the generalized gdh sum rule for proton and neutron using the values of the power corrections @xmath13 and singlet axial charge @xmath14 , systematically extracted from the jlab data @xcite and by performing a similar program of the smooth interpolation between large @xmath0 and @xmath15 .",
    "as we will see we are able to achieve a rather good description of the data at all @xmath0 values .",
    "the jlab data were obtained in the low @xmath0 region and , therefore , a special attention is needed to the qcd coupling in this domain . while the @xmath3 term in the ope works at relatively high scales @xmath16 , higher - twist ( ht ) power corrections @xmath17 etc . , start to play a significant role at lower scales , where the influence of the ghost singularities in the coefficient functions within the standard perturbation theory ( pt ) becomes more noticeable .",
    "it affects the results of extraction of the higher twists from the precise experimental data leading to unstable ope series and huge error bars @xcite .",
    "it seems natural that the weakening or elimination of the unphysical singularities of the qcd coupling would allow shifting the perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) frontier to a lower energy scale and to get more exact information about the nonperturbative part of the process described by the higher - twist series @xcite .    in this investigation , in order to avoid the influence of unphysical singularities at @xmath18 , we deal with the ghost - free analytic perturbation theory ( apt ) @xcite ( for a review on apt concepts and algorithms , see also ref .",
    "@xcite ) , which was recently proven to be an intriguing candidate for a quantitative description of light quarkonia spectra within the bethe - salpeter approach @xcite , as well as in the recent higher - twist analysis of the deep inelastic scattering data on the @xmath19 structure function @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we compare our results obtained with conventional pt and apt couplings and , finally , discuss the related uncertainties and stability issues .",
    "to recall the basic ideas of the approach let us consider the lowest moments of spin - dependent proton and neutron structure functions @xmath21 defined as @xmath22 from now on , it is understood that the elastic contribution at @xmath23 is excluded from the moments , since it is the `` inelastic '' contribution which can be matched with gdh sum rule .    at large @xmath0",
    "the moments @xmath24 are given by the ope series in powers of @xmath3 with the expansion coefficients ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . in the limit @xmath25 the moments are dominated by the leading twist contribution , @xmath26 , which can be decomposed into flavor singlet and nonsinglet contributions : @xmath27 + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mu^{p , n}_{2i}(q^2)}{q^{2i-2}},\\label{pt - gam}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the singlet and nonsinglet wilson coefficients , respectively , calculated as series in powers of @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "these coefficient functions for @xmath31 active flavors in the scheme are @xmath32 the triplet and octet axial charges @xmath33 @xcite and @xmath34 @xcite , respectively , are extracted from weak decay matrix elements . as for the singlet axial charge @xmath14 , it is convenient to work with its renormalization group ( rg ) invariant definition in the scheme @xmath35 , in which all the @xmath0 dependence is factorized into the definition of the wilson coefficient @xmath36 . for detailed discussion of the higher - loop stability of the coefficient functions and prescriptions used in actual calculations ,",
    "see ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we address both proton and neutron spin sum rules ( ssrs ) , and the singlet and octet contributions are canceled out in their difference @xmath37 resulting in the bjorken sum rule @xcite @xmath38    the unphysical singularities at @xmath39 in the pt series for the coefficient functions @xmath40 ( [ singlet ] ) and @xmath41 ( [ nonsinglet ] ) strongly affect the analysis of the spin sum rules at low @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "their influence becomes essential at @xmath42 where the ht terms start to play an important role .",
    "the `` soft - frozen '' @xmath43 models are free of such a problem , thus providing a more reliable tool of investigating the behavior of the spin sum rules in the low - energy domain",
    ".    the moments of the structure functions are analytic functions in the complex @xmath0 plane with a cut along the negative real axis , as demonstrated in refs .",
    "@xcite . on the other hand",
    ", the standard pt approach does not support these analytic properties .",
    "the apt method @xcite gives the possibility of combining the rg resummation with correct analytic properties of the qcd corrections .",
    "the consequence of requiring these properties to hold in the dis description was studied previously in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us recall that the expression for @xmath24 in the framework of the analytic approach is completely similar to the one in the standard pt ( [ pt - gam ] ) : @xmath44 + \\sum_{i=2}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mu^{apt}_{2i;\\,p , n}(q^2)}{q^{2i-2 } } \\ , .",

    "however , according to the `` effective log '' approach @xcite in the region @xmath50 one may use simple one - loop expressions ( [ ae1 - 2 ] ) with the _ effective logarithm _",
    "@xmath51 : @xmath52 thus , instead of the exact three - loop expressions for the apt functions , in eq .",
    "( [ e - apt ] ) one can use the one - loop expressions ( [ ae1 - 2 ] ) with the effective @xmath53 parameter @xmath54 whose value is given by the last relation ( [ model ] ) .",
    "this model was successfully applied for higher - twist analysis of low - energy jlab data in refs .",
    "@xcite , and also in the @xmath55 decay analysis in ref .",
    "@xcite . note also that the apt couplings are stable with respect to different loop orders at low - energy scales @xmath56 @xcite , contrary to the standard pt approach .",
    "the apt functions @xmath57 contain the @xmath58 power contributions , which effectively change the values of the @xmath59-terms , when going from the pt to the apt framework . in particular , by subtracting an extra @xmath60 term induced by the apt series for the bjorken sum rule @xmath61 where @xmath62 and @xmath63 is the effective one - loop @xmath64 parameter",
    ", we get the relation between @xmath65 coming into the apt expression ( [ apt - gam ] ) and the conventional @xmath66 from eq .",

    "we consider firstly the @xmath0-evolution of the integral @xmath71 which is equivalent to the integral over all energies of the spin - dependent photon - nucleon cross - section , whose value at @xmath15 is defined by the gdh sum rule @xcite @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the nucleon anomalous magnetic moment . then , the function @xmath74 can be written as a difference @xmath75 where @xmath76    the well - known burkhardt - cottingham ( bc ) sum rule @xcite provides us with an exact expression for @xmath77 , in terms of familiar electric @xmath78 and magnetic @xmath79 sachs form factors as @xmath80 where @xmath59 is the nucleon magnetic moment . as a consequence of the strong @xmath0 behavior of the r.h.s . of eq .",
    "( [ i2 ] ) , we get for large @xmath0 @xmath81 so @xmath82 is much smaller than @xmath83 for large @xmath0 .",
    "now from the bc sum rule ( [ i2 ] ) , it follows that @xmath84 where @xmath85 is the nucleon charge .",

    "thus , @xmath88 is a smooth and monotonous function , and it is possible to obtain its smooth interpolation between large @xmath0 and @xmath15 @xcite .",

    "@xcite , we instead make use of the smooth extrapolation of the perturbative expression ( [ itpert ] ) , to the nonperturbative domain @xmath95 defining the polynomial in positive powers of @xmath0 as @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the number of derivatives , which is a free parameter of the model , together with the matching point @xmath98 , which have to be chosen to satisfy @xmath99 in practice , the easiest way to solve the problem is to fix the number of derivatives @xmath97 and then to vary the @xmath100 value until the relation ( [ itconst ] ) is satisfied .",
    "it is interesting to note that taking @xmath101 does not allow for such a solution .",
    "such a procedure can be considered as a matching of the `` twist - like '' expansion in negative powers of @xmath0 and the `` chiral - like '' expansion in positive powers of @xmath0 @xcite , which is similar to the matching of the expansions in direct and inverse coupling constants .",
    "once we have obtained the parameters @xmath97 and @xmath92 , then the all-@xmath0 expressions for the moments @xmath102 can be restored from @xmath87 defined by eqs .",
    "( [ i1pert ] )  ( [ itnpert ] ) , by using eqs .",
    "( [ i1 ] ) and ( [ dec ] ) .",
    "as we will see below , this can be done within both the standard pt and singularity - free apt in the same way , leading to rather similar curves for @xmath0-evolution , except that in the apt case the matching point @xmath92 playing a role of the `` pqcd frontier '' in this interpolation scheme is noticeably shifted down to lower @xmath0 scales ( see the next section ) .",
    "a detailed higher twist analysis of the recent jefferson lab data @xcite on the lowest moments of the spin - dependent proton and neutron structure functions @xmath103 and @xmath2 in the range @xmath6 was performed in refs .",
    "in particular , including only three terms of the ope expansion @xmath104 in eq .",

    "the lower @xmath0 involved , the higher twist contribution is needed to describe the data . as was shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , there is some sensitivity of fitted values of @xmath107 to the minimal scale @xmath108 variations ; namely , it increases in magnitude when one incorporates into the fit the data points at lower energies .",
    "this property of the fit was treated as the slow ( logarithmic ) evolution @xmath109 ( and @xmath110 in the singlet case ) with @xmath0 which becomes more noticeable for broader fitting ranges in @xmath0 , as discussed above .",
    "indeed , fit results for @xmath107 with taking into account the rg evolution with @xmath111 , as a normalization point become more stable with respect to @xmath108 variations .",
    "however , there is still a problem how to treat the evolution of higher - twist terms @xmath112 which again may turn out to be important when one goes to lower @xmath0 , since the fit becomes more sensitive to very small variations of @xmath113 with @xmath0 .",
    "since the evolution of the higher twists @xmath114 is still theoretically unknown , they can be taken as free parameters @xcite .",
    "this procedure leads to rather small @xmath115 since more free parameters come into a fit at lower @xmath0 . on the other hand , by including @xmath113 into the fit , one observes only a small change in @xmath116  @xcite , which demonstrates its stability down to lower @xmath0 . taking this into account , in order to reduce the number of free parameters , in the current work we apply another fitting procedure and determine , first , @xmath107 and @xmath14 at higher scale @xmath111 .",
    "then we extract @xmath117 applying the known qcd evolution for @xmath109 and @xmath110 and fixing them at @xmath118 from the previous fit .",

    "<S> the generalized gerasimov - drell - hearn ( gdh ) sum rule is known to be very sensitive to qcd radiative and power corrections . </S>",
    "<S> we improve the previously developed qcd - inspired model for the @xmath0-dependence of the gdh sum rule . </S>",
    "<S> we take into account higher order radiative and higher twist power corrections extracted from precise jefferson lab data on the lowest moment of the spin - dependent proton structure function @xmath1 and on the bjorken sum rule @xmath2 . by using the singularity - free analytic perturbation theory we demonstrate that the matching point between chiral - like positive-@xmath0 expansion and qcd operator product @xmath3-expansion for the nucleon spin sum rules can be shifted down to rather low @xmath4 leading to a good description of recent proton , neutron , deuteron and bjorken sum rule data at all accessible @xmath0 . </S>"
