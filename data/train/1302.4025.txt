    "quantization of the conductance of submicron constriction in two - dimensional electron gas  @xcite is described well by the landauer formula under the assumption of spin degeneracy of one - dimensional single - particle subbands in zero magnetic field.@xcite the same approach explains the alternation of zero plateaux and peaks of thermopower ( seebeck coefficient s ) , which obeys the mott formula , @xmath3.@xcite however , the dependence @xmath4 of the conductance on the gate voltage exhibits a narrow region of anomalous behavior , the @xmath5 plateau.@xcite this plateau broadens with an increase in temperature,@xcite can disappear at @xmath6,@xcite but persists at a complete thermal spread of the conductance quantization steps.@xcite the 0.7 conductance anomaly is closely related to the anomalous plateau @xmath7 of the thermopower,@xcite which implies violation of the mott approximation @xmath8.@xcite there are dozens of works attempting to explain the 0.7 anomaly ( see refs .  , and references therein ) .",
    "numerous scenarios including spin polarization , kondo effect , wigner crystal , charge - density waves , and the formation of a quasi - localized state have been suggested .",
    "calculations that reproduce the unusual temperature behavior of the 0.7 conductance anomaly have been performed so far only within phenomenological fitting models with spin subbands,@xcite or beyond the landauer formula.@xcite although a particular mechanism of the appearance of the anomalous plateaux in conductance and thermopower remains unclear , their common reason is thought to be the electron - electron interaction , which should manifest itself most effectively at the onset of filling the first subband , where the electron system is one - dimensional .    in this work ,",
    "we start from the standard landauer approach to the description of conductance and thermopower of a single - mode ballistic quantum wire with spin degeneracy .",
    "this approach take into account interaction via the @xmath9-dependent one - dimensional reflecting barrier .",
    "first , we show that the appearance of the 0.7 anomaly implies pinning of the barrier height @xmath0 at a depth of @xmath1 below the fermi level @xmath2 and that this pinning yields the plateau @xmath7 .",
    "next , motivated by description of friedel oscillations surrounding a delta - barrier in a one - dimensional electron gas,@xcite we suggest a simple formula which reduces the @xmath9-dependent part of the correction to the interaction - induced potential to the temperature dependence of the one - dimensional electron density .",
    "the behavior of the conductance and seebeck coefficient calculated with the corrected potential agrees with the published experimental results .",
    "conductance and seebeck coefficient of single mode ballistic channel can be written within the landauer approach as follows:@xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the transmission coefficient , @xmath12 is the energy of ballistic electrons , @xmath13 is the effective @xmath9-dependent one - dimensional barrier , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the derivative of the fermi distribution function with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "there is also the mott approximation generalized for arbitrary temperatures @xmath9:@xcite @xmath17    if the barrier @xmath18 in a one - dimensional channel is sufficiently wide ( according to the three - dimensional electrostatic calculations of gate - controlled quantum wires the barrier half - width must be @xmath19  nm ) , the step in the energy dependence @xmath20 of the transmission coefficient is abrupt and the respective transition is much narrower in the energy @xmath12 than the thermal energy @xmath1 , at which the 0.7 plateau occurs .",
    "this condition is satisfied in many experiments.@xcite then , eq .",
    "[ eq-1n ] for @xmath21 , @xmath22 and mott approximation gives @xmath23,\\\\ s^m=-\\frac{k_b}{e}\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}(1+e^{\\eta})^{-1 } , \\end{gathered}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 and @xmath25 is the height of the barrier @xmath26 .",
    "clearly , the dependences @xmath27 at different @xmath9 are simply smooth steps of unit height with the fixed common point @xmath28 .",
    "curves @xmath29 and @xmath30 are numerically close to each other at the interval @xmath31 ( see appendix [ appa ] ) . the values @xmath32 in @xmath33 are not particularly interesting except that they correspond to @xmath34 .",
    "however , in experiments , there appear plateaux of @xmath4 at these values , which implies pinning of @xmath35 at a depth of @xmath1 below the fermi level ( see appendix [ appa ] ) . according to eq .",
    ", the discovered pinning can be expected to give the plateau @xmath36 ( @xmath37 ) in the curve @xmath38 .",
    "appendix [ appa ] compares the calculated plateaux with the experimental ones,@xcite and shows that parameter @xmath39 obtained from @xmath21 is equal to that from @xmath22 , which verifies applicability of eq . to the experiment .",
    "notice that this pinning differs from the pinning discussed earlier@xcite by unusual temperature dependence and single - channel transmission .",
    "the pinning that we detected seems paradoxical and urges us to suggest that a probe ballistic electron at the center of the barrier would `` see '' the potential @xmath40 , which is different from the potential @xmath41 computed self - consistently with the electron density ( see appendix [ appb ] ) .",
    "in fact , similar to our previous calculations,@xcite we computed three - dimensional electrostatics of single - mode quantum wires using different kinds of self - consistency between the potential and the electron density with@xcite and without the inclusion of exchange interaction and correlations in the local approximation .",
    "these calculations show quite definitely that the one - dimensional electron density @xmath42 in the center of the barrier is almost independent of @xmath9 and is linear in @xmath43 starting from small @xmath44 values ; i.e. , the electric capacitance between the gate and the quantum wire is conserved at @xmath45 . in addition , since the density of states is positive , @xmath46 and the dependence @xmath47 of the self - consistent barrier height on the gate voltage does not yield pinning even with the inclusion of the exchange - correlation corrections in the local approximation ( appendix [ appb ] ) .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the discovered pinning of the reflecting barrier height is due to the nonlocal interaction .",
    "it is well known in atomic physics and physics of metallic surfaces and tunneling gaps between two metals that the potential seen by a probe electron in a low - density region is different from the self - consistent potential found with the inclusion of interaction in the local approximation.@xcite this difference was attributed to nonlocal exchange and correlations , i.e. , to the attraction of the electron to an exchange - correlation hole , which remains in a high - density region.@xcite consideration of this phenomenon regarding a quantum point contact is currently unavailable , despite the obvious analogy between two metallic bars separated by a tunneling gap and two - dimensional electron gas baths separated by a potential barrier .",
    "we suggest that a ballistic electron coming to the barrier region , where the density @xmath42 is low , gets separated from its exchange - correlation hole , which is situated in the region of dense electron gas . as a result ,",
    "the local description of the correction to the potential becomes inadequate .",
    "although the hole has a complicated shape , it can be associated with the effective center .",
    "then , a decrease in the potential for the ballistic electron in the center of the barrier is @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the distance between the centers of the barrier and hole , whereas @xmath50 takes into account the shape of the hole and weakly depends on @xmath49 . in perturbation theory",
    ", we are interested in a small ( i.e. , @xmath9-dependent ) part of the correction : @xmath51\\gamma(r(t)^{-1}-r(0)^{-1}),\\ ] ] and the correction at @xmath52 is thought to be already included in the independent variable , which is the initial barrier @xmath53",
    ". obviously , @xmath49 decreases with an increase in @xmath42 , until the electron and hole recombine and the local approximation for the interaction term becomes valid in the center of the barrier . according to this tendency and the smallness of the @xmath9-dependent correction",
    ", we can write @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are found perturbatively from the single - particle wavefunctions in the barrier @xmath53 . in a certain range of the barrier height",

    "is formally a special case of the interaction - induced correction @xmath58 , here , @xmath59 stands for friedel density oscillations .",
    "this correction results from calculation of the propagation through the delta barrier in a one - dimensional electron system,@xcite in which case @xmath60 is a result of the competition between the exchange ( @xmath61 ) and direct ( @xmath62 ) contribution to the interaction .",
    "a similar correction was used to simulate multimode quantum wires.@xcite we can attempt to extend the range of this correction , with the respective change in the meaning of @xmath63 to the entire first subband of the quantum wire , including the top of the smooth barrier .",
    "to find this correction perturbatively , we first compute the complete set of wavefunctions for the bare smooth barrier @xmath53 and find the electron density @xmath64 at a given temperature : @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath67  nm is the length scale , @xmath68 is the electron effective mass , and @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the wavefunction of electrons incident on the barrier from the left ( right ) .",
    "the amplitude of the incident wave is set to unity .",
    "the bare potential is specified as @xmath71 .",
    "this form is quite appropriate for simulation of short ballistic channels , including escape to two - dimensional reservoirs.@xcite this potential does not yield any features in the transmittance @xmath20 except the steps of unit height.@xcite the values of the parameters were taken to be typical for ballistic quantum wires in a gaas / algaas two - dimensional electron gas . the calculated dependence @xmath72",

    "<S> it has been shown within the landauer single - channel approach that the presence of the 0.7 anomaly in the conductance of a ballistic microcontact and the respective plateau in the thermopower implies unusual pinning of the potential barrier height @xmath0 at a depth of @xmath1 below the fermi level @xmath2 . a simple way of taking into account the effect of electron - electron interaction on the profile and temperature dependence of a smooth one - dimensional potential barrier in the lower spin degeneracy subband of the microcontact has been proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated temperature dependences of the conductance and seebeck coefficient agree with the experimental gate - voltage dependences , including the emergence of anomalous plateaux with an increase in temperature . </S>"
