    "the baryon asymmetry of the universe can be dynamically generated during the evolution of the universe , if the mechanism of baryogenesis satisfies the three sakharov conditions [ 1 ] .",
    "the three sakharov conditions are : the presence of baryon number violation , the violation of both c and cp , and a deviation from thermal equilibrium .",
    "it is known that the universe can escape out of the thermal equilibrium by means of electroweak phase transition , which should be strongly first - order in order to ensure sufficient deviation from thermal equilibrium to generate the baryon asymmetry that is observed today .",
    "however , it has been already recognized that the standard model ( sm ) has some difficulty to realize the desired electroweak phase transition .",
    "the present experimental lower bound on the mass of the sm higgs boson does not allow the electroweak phase transition to be strongly first - order [ 2 , 3 ] .",
    "the electroweak phase transition is weakly first - order or higher order in the sm .",
    "thus , the sm is inadequate to generate sufficient baryon asymmetry .",
    "moreover , the amount cp violation in the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix is too small to account for the baryon asymmetry of the observed universe [ 4 ] .",
    "consequently , new physical models beyond the sm have extensively been studied for the possibility of reasonable explanation of the baryon asymmetry of the universe .",
    "especially , the low energy supersymmetric models have been studied widely within the context of electroweak baryogenesis [ 5 - 7 ] . the simplest supersymmetric model that includes",
    "the sm is the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , which possesses in its superpotential the @xmath1 term that accounts for the mixing between two higgs doublets .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter , which has the mass dimension , causes some problem with respect to its energy scale [ 8 ] .",
    "several possibilities have been investigated in the literature to solve the so - called @xmath1 problem [ 9 - 12 ] .",
    "introducing an additional @xmath0 to the mssm is one of the plausible explanations for the @xmath1 problem of the mssm .",
    "the mssm with an extra @xmath0 can not only solve the @xmath1 problem but we will show that it can also overcome the difficulties that the sm encounters when the sm tries to satisfy the sakharov conditions .",
    "this model can accommodate sufficient cp violation , because it possesses other sources of cp violation besides the ckm matrix .",
    "it is possible to realize the explicit cp violation in this model by means of complex cp phases arising from the soft susy breaking terms [ 12 ] .",
    "then , it is the purpose of this paper to show that this model indeed allows the strongly first - order electroweak phase transitions such that it can successfully explain the baryogenesis .",
    "the characteristics of the electroweak phase transitions are determined essentially by the temperature - dependent part of the higgs potential .",
    "we construct the full temperature - dependent higgs potential at the one - loop level , and examine if the electroweak phase transition may be strongly first - order .",
    "two methods are employed for the construction of the temperature - dependent higgs potential .",
    "one method assumes that the critical temperature at which the electroweak phase transition occurs is relatively high , thus the temperature - dependent effective potential is approximated by retaining only terms proportional to @xmath2 , whereas the other method carries out numerically exact integrations of the temperature - dependent effective potential .",
    "the thermal effects of particles whose masses are comparatively smaller than the critical temperature are included at the one - loop level in the former method , whereas the particle content is different in the latter method .    either way",
    ", we obtain almost the same physical results .",
    "unlike the mssm , this model allows a strongly first - order electroweak phase transition in a wide region of the parameter space , and the first - order electroweak phase transition can be strong enough without requiring a light stop quark .",
    "an interesting behavior of this model with respect to the strongly first - order electroweak phase transition is that the mass of the lightest neutral higgs boson becomes larger when the phase transition gets stronger . on the other hand ,",
    "the masses of the other three neutral higgs bosons become smaller when the phase transition gets stronger .",
    "the mssm with an extra @xmath0 accommodates in its higgs sector two higgs doublets @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and one higgs singlet , @xmath5 . in terms of these higgs fields ,",
    "the relevant part of the superpotential of this model may be written as @xmath6 where we take into account only the third generation : @xmath7 and @xmath8 are , respectively , the right - handed singlet top and bottom quark superfields , @xmath9 is the right - handed singlet exotic quark ( a vector - like down quark ) superfield , @xmath10 is the left - handed @xmath11 doublet quark superfield of the third generation , and @xmath12 is the left - handed singlet exotic quark superfield .",
    "further , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 are , respectively , the dimensionless yukawa coupling coefficients of top , bottom , and exotic quark superfields , and @xmath16 is an antisymmetric @xmath17 matrix with @xmath18 .    from the superpotential , at zero temperature",

    ", @xmath33 and @xmath34 may in general be complex numbers .",
    "however , they will be assumed to be real in the subsequent discussions , as we do not consider cp violation in the higgs sector .",
    "the soft masses are also assumed to be real , without loss of generality , and they are eventually eliminated by imposing minimum conditions with respect to the neutral higgs fields , the gauge invariance of the superpotential under of @xmath0 requires that the three @xmath0 hypercharges should satisfy @xmath35 .",
    "the above higgs potential at the tree level would allow the three neutral higgs fields @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath5 to develop the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 , respectively .",
    "remark that these vevs are obtained at zero temperature .",
    "however , for simplicity , we omit the temperature dependence of these vevs until next section where we take into account the finite temperature effect",
    ".    the tree - level higgs potential should now be corrected by the radiative one - loop effects . in susy models ,",
    "the radiative corrections due to the top and stop quarks contribute most dominantly to the tree - level higgs sector . besides",
    ", if @xmath41 is very large , the radiative corrections due to the bottom and sbottom quarks should also be included since they become no longer negligible .",
    "furthermore , the radiative corrections due to the exotic quark and squark may be important since the yukawa coupling of the exotic quark to the singlet field @xmath5 can be large at the electroweak scale [ 11 ] .",

    "the higgs sector of the present model consists of six physical higgs bosons : a pair of charged higgs boson , one neutral pseudoscalar higgs boson , and three neutral scalar higgs bosons .",

    "we would take the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 at the cross - marked point , namely , ( @xmath98 ) = ( -1 , -0.1 ) , and hence @xmath105 = 1.1 .    with these parameter values at hand",

    "the second method is to perform the integration in @xmath67 in numerically exact way , and to consider only the contributions of top , bottom , and exotic quarks and squarks .",

    "we select those terms that are proportional to @xmath2 in the above expression , which become most dominant at high temperature .",
    "thus , we assume that the temperature at which the electroweak phase transition takes place is sufficiently high .",
