    "therefore , simplified constitutive equations have been proposed in the literature that describe stresses that the polymers exert on the flow for a given deformation history ( see for example @xcite and references therein ) .",

    "this approach , also known as quasi ",
    "equilibrium approximation , is also used successfully in other branches of statistical physics @xcite .",
    "the resulting , quasi  equilibrium approximation to the dynamics , by construction , shows several desirable features like conservation of the dissipative nature of the dynamics and conservation of positive  definiteness of distribution functions .",

    "we also present an algorithm for the numerical implementation of the constitutive equations .",
