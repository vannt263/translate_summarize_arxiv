    "in this article we will refer to appendices 2 , 3 and 4 for a basic introduction to correspondence analysis , sequence - constrained hierarchical clustering and the haar wavelet transform on a hierarchy . in section [ sect11 ]",
    "we will first review the terminology that we use .      by ultrametric",
    "we intend a precise definition of `` hierarchy '' which as such is a loose concept .",
    "the ultrametric inequality holds for pairwise distances ( for a distance , @xmath0 , defined for all pairs of points @xmath1 as a symmetric , positive - definite mapping to the reals , the ultrametric inequality holds for all triplets of points , @xmath2 : @xmath3 ) .",
    "a set of ultrametric distances can be derived from a binary ( i.e. , each non - terminal node has either one or two child nodes ; a terminal node has no child node ) , ranked ( i.e. , each node in the hierarchy has a `` level '' value associated which is typically positive real - valued ) rooted tree @xcite .",
    "reciprocally , a binary , ranked rooted tree , known as a dendrogram , is a representation of an ultrametric set of distances .",
    "we can relax the binary property of this tree but often it is algorithmically convenient to impose this .    by regression , we mean some mapping of independent or explanatory variable @xmath4 onto a dependent or response variable , @xmath5 , such that the behavior of @xmath5 as a function of @xmath6 can be studied . in this work",
    ", @xmath6 is multidimensional , while @xmath5 is unidimensional .",
    "a novelty is that @xmath6 is ultrametric , i.e.  all triplets of points satisfy the ultrametric inequality ; or we avail of a hierarchical structure on @xmath6 .    wavelet regression or wavelet smoothing is `` potentially highly locally adaptive '' @xcite .",
    "a data signal or set of points is projected into a new basis such that spatial and frequency properties are brought out or exposed .",
    "( consider , for comparative purposes , the following .",
    "a sinusoidal basis system used in fourier analysis helps with frequency properties but not with spatial .",
    "a basis of principal components helps with spatial properties but not with frequency properties . )",
    "the wavelet transform projection itself is invertible .",
    "this means that data can be reconstructed , after carrying out modifications in transform space .",
    "( the same principle can be applied in fourier analysis or principal component analysis . )",
    "modification in wavelet space typically involves setting low - valued wavelet coefficients to zero , leading to a smoother reconstruction .",
    "a novelty in our work is that we understand wavelet regression to involve both explanatory and response variables , rather than just wavelet smoothing of erstwhile explanatory variables .    as we will see below",
    ", our wavelet transform is a hierarchical one , in the sense of being carried out on a hierarchical clustering or dendrogram .",
    "it is therefore a wavelet transform in an ultrametric space , or an ultrametric wavelet transform .    in this context",
    ", the effect of wavelet coefficient thresholding leads to piecewise constant function approximation .",
    "we will sketch out the explanation for this .",
    "the subnodes of any given node are determined in transform space by a positive or a negative detail vector .",
    "( the dimensionality of this vector is the dimensionality of the points we are working on .",
    "it is possible that these points are single valued . )",
    "so left and right subnodes are defined as the parent node s vector , plus or minus ( respectively ) the detail vector . setting the detail vector to zero",
    "just means that the subnodes , in the reconstructed or wavelet - smoothed data , now become , both identically , equal to the parent node . in other words , within the cluster defined by the parent node , we now have a ( constant within the cluster ) vector given by the parent node .",
    "wavelet smoothing , in the way that we are implementing it here , furnishes a constant vector within a cluster .",
    "the approach we develop in this article is based on the following .    1 .",
    "a goal is `` subsequence clustering '' or segmentation .",
    "2 .   normalization and weighting of time series and attributes are addressed .",
    "we closely interface the analysis with interpretation .",
    "we regress the hierarchical segmentation on external time series .",
    "we will discuss each of these briefly in turn , in a comparative setting .",
    "we will also look at statistical changepoint analysis , and a divisive segmentation tree approach .    unlike in @xcite",
    "we are concerned with segmentation of a multivariate time series , and not clustering a collection of time series .",
    "this distinction is referred to as , resectively , `` whole clustering '' and `` subsequence clustering '' by @xcite .",
    "singhal et al .",
    "@xcite build their clustering around principal components analysis , and we also use correspondence analysis  appropriate for our frequency count data  to provide an embedding from which distances can be easily defined .",
    "the great deal of recent work on clustering within time series signals , e.g.  the incremental and divisive hierarchical algorithm of @xcite , has been critiqued by @xcite on the grounds of meaningfulness .",
    "goldin et al .",
    "@xcite however point out that use of euclidean distance is overly simplistic and that data normalization is needed , which they phrase in terms of `` distances between cluster shapes rather than between cluster sets '' .",
    "the need to consider normalization issues very attentively , and the close resulting links between distance , shape , and other properties ( size , scale , angle , etc . ) , are all well known in the correspondence analysis area .",
    "see @xcite , in particular chapter 4 , which presents case studies of analysis of size and shape , and financial time series modeling and forecasting .    in this article",
    "we develop a new approach to hierarchical clustering of multivariate time series based on a rigorous treatment of weighting of time series and attributes .",
    "our innovative approach incorporates piecewise or clusterwise approximation to a time series or one - dimensional signal . unlike @xcite",
    ", we do not seek to fit patterns directly on the data .",
    "similar type approaches have been pursued in @xcite .",
    "instead we fit the piecewise approximation based on a given hierarchical clustering .",
    "furthermore we do not want to determine time series segments in a void , removed from external explanatory and indeed causative discussion .",
    "therefore we are led to regress the hierarchical segmentation , as an explanatory input , onto time series , comprising response variables , that are external to the initial phase of hierarchical segmentation building .",
    "isofinder @xcite seeks to segment a genome sequence by repeatedly finding a splitting point and looking for a significant difference in the subsequences to the left and right of the splitting point .",
    "significant difference comes from a t - test between means to left and right ; and a bootstrap - based setting of significance level .",
    "one aspect of our approach that differs from isofinder is that we support a fully multivariate input signal .",
    "isofinder could remain as a divisive approach for multivariate input through use of a quadtree and octtree decomposition , although it would become clumsy relative to our bottom - up tree - building .",
    "statistical changepoint analysis is exemplified by @xcite .",
    "a probability model is established for the changepoints .",
    "this probability mass function uses the distance between successive changepoints . within segments",
    "linear or polynomial regression is used .",
    "this is of unknown order which is to be estimated .",
    "since movement from one changepoint to the next uses transition probabilities , this is to say that a markov process is used .",
    "positions of changepoints and the regression model orders are sought , using stochastic optimization within a map , maximum a posteriori , schema . in fearnhead05 ,",
    "piecewise linear regression is used for `` regression models where the underlying functional relationship between the response and the explanatory variable is modeled as independent linear regressions on disjoint segments . ''    in @xcite applied to speech and motion tracking , even if called `` piecewise constant '' it is in our terminology `` piecewise linear '' : the model is local linear regression with `` piecewise constant parameters '' .    in @xcite ,",
    "the limits of a clusterwise linear approach are noted .",
    "a `` piecewise linear model can determine where the data goes up or down and at what rate .",
    "unfortunately , when the data does not follow a linear model , the computation of the local slope creates overfitting . '' in @xcite , adaptive polynomial ( including a 0 order , or constant ) degree of fit in each piecewise region is pursued in the modeling of stock prices and ecg data .",
    "relative to @xcite and , for example , @xcite , our approach is not parametric . in terms of evaluation",
    "therefore we are more concerned to link results with external data , both qualitative ( e.g.  causes of changepoints of varying degrees of importance ) and quantitative ( e.g.other univariate time series ) .",
    "therefore the applications of our work and their context is somewhat different from these parametric modeling approaches .      in this article",
    ", we will interchangeably refer to a time series defined on a timeline and a signal with support given by this timeline .",
    "broadly speaking we will also use interchangeably the following terms : hierarchy , tree , dendrogram , ultrametric space .",
    "a range of other terms , algorithms and methods are introduced and discussed in the appendices .    in section [ sect2 ]",
    "the data and problem is discussed , together with aspects relating to methodology that are at issue in this article .    in section [ sect3 ] , the relevance and indeed importance of hierarchy in the data analysis is addressed",
    ".    in section [ sect4 ] the association of a hierarchy with an external signal is at issue .",
    "we develop a new way to map the latter onto the hierarchy .    in section [ sect5 ]",
    "we study how the mapping of external signal to the hierarchy can lead to new insights .",
    "the data used in this work related to conflict violence and were produced by cerac , the conflict analysis resource center , www.cerac.org.co .",
    "we will refer to the data used as the cerac colombia conflict database .",
    "it is being grown on an ongoing basis . from @xcite ,",
    "we use high frequency micro - data , relating to internal conflict violence in colombia ( population : 44 million ) from 1988 to 2004 , hence over a period of more than 16 years .",
    "conflict violence in colombia is not based primarily on ethnic , religious , or regional differences , as is often the case elsewhere , but it instead has roots in economic and political factors .",
    "economic drivers include , for instance , the narcotics sector and kidnapping .",
    "the cerac data records discrete action types , their intensity , dates , locations and other information .",
    "event types are broken down at the first divide into clashes requiring multilateral engagement , and attacks which are unilateral .",
    "intensity breaks down mainly into killings and injuries . for the data period",
    ", the colombian conflict has seen more than 3000 killings plus injuries per year .",
    "one use of the dataset has been to analyze civilian casualties @xcite .    in @xcite distribution of fatalities over time",
    "was found to follow a power law .",
    "furthermore the work of these authors points to how remarkably similar power law behavior can be found in conflicts ranging from iraq to indonesia .",
    "such power law behavior leads to self - similarity , i.e. , burstiness on all aggregation scales .",
    "( see examples of application of this in @xcite and general discussion in @xcite . ) as a result it is difficult to smooth such data , and hence it is difficult to fit simple parametric models . under such circumstances",
    "it is feasible to seek and find patterns and trends in the data , and it is precisely these goals which are at issue in this work .    in this article , we present a novel approach for the study of dynamics .",
    "firstly we look at visualizations using correspondence analysis murtaghca .",
    "the output spatial representation is an equiweighted euclidean one , with embedding of both rows and columns  events , and the attributes used for these events  and this allows cluster analysis and other analyses to bypass any other form of data normalization or standardization .",
    "we then study change versus continuity over time , allowing for gradation in such change .",
    "a hierarchical clustering is used , taking account of the timeline , presenting change cluster , breakpoints and timeline resolution - related properties .",
    "context is offered by the following . in @xcite , the price of cocaine in the us from 1983 onwards",
    "is found to be affected by interdiction effectiveness , and this in turn is found to be beneficial in terms of reduced consumption , at least in the short run .    in our analysis",
    "we will look at how narcotics prices might be related to the colombian violence .",
    "causal mechanisms could take place in different ways .",
    "for example a declining world market for narcotics could put great pressure on production , leading to violent reaction when faced with declining returns . or an expanding market could lead to greater violence because the spoils are greater .",
    "a further consideration is that causal mechanisms may work themselves out at different rates , and even in different ways , on the wholesale and retail markets .",
    "the retail markets for illegal narcotics are driven by actors who are distributed far and wide relative to the locations of production .",
    "the cocaine drug comes from the _ coca _ plant .",
    "most initially processed cocaine on the world narcotics markets come from colombia . a main tool in combating production by the colombian government has been crop spraying , leading to production being dispersed in jungle regions or national parks .",
    "the coca plant is very different from the _ cocoa _ bean from the _ cacao _ tree , from which chocolate is produced . _",
    "coffee _ , from coffee beans of the coffee plant , is the leading legal agricultural export from colombia .",
    "the latter fact is important because ( for example , as just one possible economic mechanism ) a declining market for coffee could conceivably lead to product substitution in response .",
    "opiates come from the opium poppy . like cocaine ,",
    "opiates are also narcotic alkaloids .",
    "morphine , derived from opium , is used for medicinal purposes , whereas heroin is a generally banned narcotic .",
    "while poppy production has been at times of some significance in colombia , mostly the leading opiates producer worldwide has been afghanistan .",
    "however for supply of opiates to the us , colombia and mexico play a major role .",
    "as noted above in regard to the complexity of economic mechanisms , there are intricate linkages between , say , cocaine and opiates , involving many social actors .",
    "we used 144 numerical attributes relating to killings and injuries coming from 20,288 dated events : see appendix 1 .",
    "aggregating by month the numerical data , 144 attributes used , yielded data for 204 successive months . further aggregating by year provided us with data for the 15 years , 1990 to 2004 , each year having a 144-valued vector of values where we eliminated 1988 and 1989 because we did not have narcotics data for these years ( see section [ sect4 ] ) .",
    "a short periodization of the conflict is as follows @xcite : reintensification of conflict in 1986 , roughly constant then to 1994 , followed by continuous acceleration .",
    "19881991 , adjustment period  due to the end of the cold war ; 19921996 , stagnation period ; and from 1997 onwards , upsurge period . in the section to follow",
    "there will be further discussion of periodization .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows a best planar representation , accounting for 62% of the information content of the data as expressed by the combined moments of inertia of the cloud of years ( or of the cloud of attributes ) about these two axes .",
    "following somewhat clumped characteristics of the years 1990 through 1997 , there is a break then with the year 1998 . from 1997",
    "an arc is formed , up to 2004 . a break between the years 1997 and 1998 ,",
    "( i ) , is followed by a later break , between 2001 and 2002 , ( ii ) .",
    "the 1998 changepoint , ( i ) , was in a period when guerrilla gains from 1996 onwards were being reversed , a process that was seen to be so by 1999 .",
    "there were high levels of government casualties in 19971998 , due to guerrilla operations against isolated military and police bases .",
    "in particular through airborne weaponry , the government got the upper hand .",
    "the `` upsurge period '' from 1997 onwards also saw a rise of ( anti - guerrilla ) paramilitary activity whereas before they had been involved in drug trafficking .",
    "the paramilitaries started operations around 1997 .",
    "there was a consolidation of paramilitary groups in 1997 , announced publicly in december 1997 , and they became active then , having many of their own number killed .",
    "it was not until 1999 that paramilitaries began to kill large numbers of guerrillas . among all of these mutually influencing , reinforcing or retarding , trends and events , our analysis points to a succession of two years where the global change was most intense .",
    "we now come to the 2002 changepoint , ( ii ) .",
    "a peak of ( paramilitary ) casualties brought about by government against paramilitaries was in 2002 due to aerial bombardment of a paramilitary position under attack by guerrillas .",
    "it was a major setback for the paramilitaries , who declared a truce following the election that year of president alvaro uribe .    . a sequence constrained complete link agglomeration criterion was used",
    "the main caesuras or changepoints here are ( i ) in moving from year 8 = 1997 to year 9 = 1998 ; and ( ii ) in moving from year 12 = 2001 to year 13 = 2002.,width=302 ]    figure [ fig2 ] shows ( i ) the caesuras between 1997 ( 8th year ) and 1998 ( 9th year ) ; and ( ii ) between 2001 ( 12th year ) and 2002 ( 13th year )",
    ". subtrees before and after these caesuras are clearly distinguishable in the full tree . in line with figure [ fig1 ] , what figure [ fig2 ] indicates is that these are the important caesuras in this data .",
    "note that the same data as seen in the planar projection in figure [ fig1 ] , viz .",
    "the factor 1 and 2 projections , is used for the construction of the hierarchy of figure [ fig2 ] .    the data used to construct the hierarchy in figure [ fig2 ] is of inherent dimension min(20288 events , 204 months , 144 attributes , 15 years ) @xmath7 ( from section [ data ] ; see also appendices 1 and 2 ) .",
    "furthermore , based on figure [ fig1 ] , we in fact used the first two factors only .",
    "so the input data dimensionality on which the hierarchy in figure [ fig2 ] is based is 2 .",
    "correspondence analysis ( figure [ fig1 ] ) embeds both annually aggregated events and their attributes in the same euclidean space . as a basis for subsequent analysis , e.g.  clustering , weighting and normalization",
    "are taken care of as part of the euclidean embedding algorithm .",
    "appendix 2 presents an overview of correspondence analysis .",
    "the hierarchical clustering of figure [ fig2 ] is built on the timeline .",
    "this means that clusters are contiguous on the yearly timeline .",
    "input to the hierarchical clustering is factor projections from the correspondence analysis implying that the 15 yearly aggregated events are equiweighted and endowed with the euclidean distance .",
    "appendix 3 presents an overview of this sequence - constrained hierarchical clustering .",
    "figure [ fig2 ] provides a hierarchical understanding of the colombian conflict violence over the years 1990 to 2004 .",
    "it ranks change by order of importance .",
    "bigger change is associated with more distinct branches in the tree .",
    "a hierarchy defines an ultrametric topology .",
    "so we can justifiably characterize figure [ fig2 ] as an ultrametric , or tree metric , understanding of the colombian conflict violence .",
    "in the same way the semantics of colombian society are displayed in a metric , rather than ultrametric , way in figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "we have a structured view in figure [ fig2 ] of the socio - dynamics of the situation in colombia over the years 1990 to 2004 .",
    "let us call it @xmath8 .",
    "this is the set of interrelationships expressed in figure [ fig2 ] over the years 19902004 .",
    "it is a summarized view of those years .",
    "it is a synthetic view , and depends not just on the algorithms applied but  a most important aspect  on the input data used . as a structured view of the socio - dynamics of colombia",
    ", we now seek to associate @xmath8 with other external signals defined on the same time period .    as potentially relevant economic sectors outside colombia we will consider the narcotics sector .",
    "we will consider two narcotics signals .",
    "figure [ fig3 ] shows the opiates wholesale price , in the us , averaged per year , in us$/kg . our aim is to look for linkages between the evolving colombian socio - dynamic expressed in figure [ fig2 ] and distant reflections of this , such as the particular narcotics market situation shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "production is expressed ( in a highly complicated way ) in the former , figure fig2 , while consumption is expressed in the latter , figure [ fig3 ] .    as noted in section [ considerations ] there are particular breakpoints easily visible in figure [ fig2 ] , e.g.  in moving from year 8 = 1997 to year 9 = 1998 ; and in moving from year 12 = 2001 to year 13 = 2002 . in figure [ fig3 ] something of this is visible too : year 9 is early in a period of precipitous fall ( i.e. , fall in wholesale price ) ; and year 13 is a clearly visible turning point .",
    "let us map the opiates data in figure [ fig3 ] into the hierarchical structure , @xmath8 , of figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "one way to do this is to have a set of within - cluster constant approximations to the opiates ( figure [ fig3 ] data ) , and furthermore to allow for a range of such constant approximations .    in practice",
    "we will use constant approximations of the opiates data , figure [ fig3 ] , that are governed by the embedded clusters of @xmath8 , figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "however we will not proceed by cluster level ( or dendrogram level from the root ) because this would imply different cluster cardinalities at each level  and hence a not very sensible ordering of what are ultimately approximations to the full data set .",
    "we will read off approximations to the hierarchy by decreasing _",
    "differences _ in information between dendrogram levels . we will allow ourselves to be guided by these differences in information between levels .",
    "this information is available to us through the dendrogram s haar wavelet transform .",
    "see appendix 4 for background detail .    in figure [ fig5 ] , we see the succession of better approximations , quantified by mean squared error ( mse ) , as given by decreasing absolute values of the dendrogram haar wavelet detail coefficients .    in regard to use here and later of mse , note that the size of this goodness of fit value is strongly influenced by the signal s values , ",
    "cf.ordinates in displays .",
    "the mse is not scale - invariant and the ordinate scale impacts on the mses .",
    "note that the indication `` thresholded at level 3 '' , for instance , in figure [ fig5 ] , is to be understood as at the third , ordered by decreasing value , wavelet detail coefficient .",
    "this is not necessarily the third dendrogram level from the root .",
    "we additionally now consider a set of signals , see upper left panel in figures [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] .",
    "there are , including the initial analysis of the previous section :    * opiates and cocaine retail prices ( street price ) , us$/gram , see opiates . *",
    "opiates and cocaine wholesale price , us$/kg , see @xcite .    in figures",
    "[ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] exact reconstruction of the input signal , displayed in the upper left , is possible if no thresholding is used .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the successive approximations to the opiate retail prices  again in the us , from 1990 to 2004 , street prices in us$/gram @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] shows the successive approximations to the cocaine wholesale prices  in the us , from 1990 to 2004 , in us$/kg @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] shows the successive approximations to the cocaine retail prices  in the us , from 1990 to 2004 , street prices in us$/gram opiates .",
    "we denote the hierarchy in figure [ fig2 ] as @xmath8 and a signal such as that in figure [ fig3 ] as @xmath9 .",
    "both @xmath8 and @xmath9 have the same support , viz .  the ordered years 1990 to 2004 .",
    "we are projecting the ultrametric space , @xmath8 , onto the signal @xmath9 .",
    "we have : @xmath10 .",
    "this can be viewed too as an ultrametric regression , i.e.  we are regressing @xmath11 on @xmath8 .",
    "we estimate our signal from the hierarchy : @xmath12 .",
    "consider now the segmentation as a clusterwise regression problem .",
    "we could approach the clusterwise regression by partition that is read off the hierarchy in figure [ fig2 ] . using the haar wavelet",
    "transform instead reads off partitions in order of mse ( mean square error ) of approximation of the input signal by the wavelet filtered and reconstructed signal .",
    "the mse provides us with a measure of the approximation of the piecewise constant ( which is also linear : but for constant ordinate or response variable ) fit to the input signal .",
    "note that each partition of the hierarchy covers the full signal , i.e.  each partition is by definition defined on the input s support .",
    "a baseline scenario for what we now seek is shown in figure [ fig8888 ] . in this figure",
    "we show a simple and direct clusterwise fit to each of the four signals .",
    "we replace the first eight values , in the first cluster , with their mean value ; and similarly for the second cluster ; and the third .",
    "the goodness of fit is given for each quadrant from upper left to lower right as indicated in the figure caption .",
    "can our wavelet regression perform better ?",
    "the mean square errors ( mses ) , we find , are improved in all four cases . respectively , as we will see , the mse of opiates wholesale decreases from 223 to 206 .",
    "the mse of opiates retail decreases from 1533 to 616 .",
    "the mse of cocaine wholesale decreases from 305 to 290 . and the mse of cocaine retail decreases from 18 to 12 .    ,",
    "viz .  from year 1",
    "= 1990 to year 8 = 1997 ; from year 9 = 1998 to year 12 = 2001 ; and from year 13 = 2002 to year 15 = 2004 .",
    "then we simply trace the piecewise constant fits , in each case , to the four different narcotics market signals .",
    "these fits are shown by the small circle piecewise constant curves .",
    "the mean square errors are , respectively for opiates wholesale and retail , and cocaine wholesale and retail : 223 , 1533 , 305 and 18.,width=453 ]    from figures [ fig5 ] , [ fig6 ] , [ fig7 ] and [ fig8 ] we selected segmentations with at least three segments in each , corresponding to the major breakpoints discussed in section [ considerations ] . the signals used and the clusterwise constant approximated versions are shown in figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] .",
    "figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] can be viewed as follows . from the hierarchy in figure [ fig2 ] , with its important caesuras as discussed in section [ considerations ] , take a range of within - cluster signal values as their mean .",
    "this implies that we have a piecewise linear approximation of the signals , in the sense of clusterwise constant .",
    "compared to our baseline scenario shown in figure [ fig8888 ] we intervene on  modify in wavelet transform space  a number of clusters characterized by small changes in the hierarchy .",
    "our baseline of figure [ fig8888 ] shows breakpoints over the 15-year time span .",
    "the respective breakpoints of figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] are largely consistent , as summarized in table [ tabbreakpoints ] , while ( we may say informally ) using the hierarchy as a `` key '' or `` template '' .",
    ".breakpoints in the colombian 15-year violence timeline .",
    "the breakpoints were read off the figures noted in the table .",
    "we see , for example , that for the cocaine wholesale signal , the breakpoints are such that there is a segment consisting of years 1 to 5 ; then a segment of years 6 to 8 ; and finally a segment from year 9 to year 15 . from the crude signal segmentation of figure [ fig8888 ] and the wavelet smoothings of figures [ fig9 ] and [ fig10 ] , there is considerable consistency . [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,>,<,^,^,^ \" , ]        the principle of `` folding '' the hierarchy onto an external signal is as follows .",
    "the wavelet transform codifies the hierarchy . having that , we apply the `` codification '' of the hierarchy with the new , external signal as input .",
