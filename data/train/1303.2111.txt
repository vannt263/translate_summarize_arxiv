    "we divided the absorbers into three subsamples using historically motivated weak @xcite , intermediate @xcite , and strong @xcite equivalent width ranges . in order to determine whether our absorber subsamples are consistent with being cosmologically distributed along the lines of sight to the quasars",

    "we thus proceed under the assumption that our sample of absorbers is a fair sample .    for our analysis in  [ sec : results ] , we obtained absolute @xmath50-band and apparent magnitudes ( primarily @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 ) of the quasars .",
    "the majority were obtained from @xcite ; 16 were obtained from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ; and for two quasars , the magnitudes could not be determined so these lines of sight and their absorbers were omitted from analysis for which these quantities were required .",

    "* ) for line and candidate identification , and all three ostensibly used the same algorithms in determining the redshift paths for each system . to test for possible differences in the calculations , we ran our code used for this survey on the identical spectra and set of systems used by @xcite and compared their @xmath75 and @xmath4 results with those of the reproduced study .",
    "the result was that the @xmath75 values from the @xcite study were @xmath76 larger than our reproduced values from their data , and the @xmath4 values from the original study were thereby lowered compared to our reproduced study .",

    "if our redshift paths had been calculated exactly as theirs , the @xmath4 result of this survey would presumably have been lower , further widening the discrepancy with previous works .",

    "the ks test was performed between all possible pairs of the three surveys .",

    "in contrast , the @xcite survey differed from each of the other two to a confidence level of @xmath78 and had a median apparent magnitude of 16.3 .",
    "a uniform set of apparent magnitudes in the same band was not available , however , making these comparisons uncertain .",

    "@xmath50-band magnitude distributions , but when each survey was tested against the other two , it could not be ruled out to even a @xmath77 confidence level that their distributions had been drawn from the same population . similarly , no substantial differences were found in the overall median quasar absolute magnitude of the three surveys : @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 for @xcite , @xcite , and this study , respectively .",
    "the reasons behind the different @xmath4 results among the three works remain unclear ; future studies will hopefully resolve the weak puzzle .",
    "it may be that the inclusion or exclusion of weak systems very close to the limiting equivalent width may play a role ( anand narayanan , private communication ) , as well as differences in the codes used , since the calculation of @xmath75 is extremely sensitive for the weakest systems .",
    "the number of absorbers per unit redshift is the product of the proper number density of absorbers and their proper geometric cross section . in the standard cosmological model , the no - evolution expectation ( nee ) for the redshift number density",

    "as shown in figure  [ fig : residual]@xmath85 , our observed @xmath4 departs strikingly from the nee ( dashed curve ) , which was normalized to the mean @xmath86 , 1.098 , and to the overall @xmath4 , 0.83 , of our weak sample over the redshift range @xmath53 .",
    "the general behavior of @xmath4 is in agreement with @xcite in that it peaks between @xmath87 and then decreases toward higher redshift .",

    "the discrepancy compared to grbs arises , the authors state , because their absorber redshift distribution is shifted higher than that of quasars , resulting in less loss of detected absorbers .",

    "we also studied equivalent width distributions binned by relative beam sizes using @xmath186 as a proxy , i.e. assuming that the square of the source radius @xmath187 is proportional to the @xmath50-band luminosity of the quasar .",
    "the ratio of the source radius for quasar @xmath143 relative to the median radius for the full quasar sample can then be written @xcite as @xmath188 we then studied the effect of changing beam size with redshift due to cosmology .",
    "we calculated the ratio of the relative beam size of quasar @xmath143 at the redshift of absorber @xmath189 to the cross section of the source : @xmath190 ^ 2\\ ] ] where @xmath191 , @xmath192 is the angular diameter distance at the absorption redshift of system @xmath189 , and @xmath193 is the angular diameter distance at the source redshift of quasar @xmath143 .",
    "finally , we examined the combined effect of source size and cosmology , by using equation [ equationradii ] to scale @xmath194 .    using the ks test ,",
    "none of these equivalent width distributions yielded significant differences ( of at least 3 @xmath12 ) between the faint and bright quasar samples . since the @xmath4 discrepancy is in this case of a smaller magnitude than in the case of the quasar ",
    "grb phenomenon , it may require a larger data set to discern the reasons behind the observations .",
    "the findings of @xcite do offer an intriguing possibility by relating absorption redshift distributions to @xmath4 .",
    "our faint absorber samples do have lower median @xmath86 values than our bright samples across all three equivalent width ranges , probably a result of the correlation whereby intrinsically more luminous quasars tend to be selected at higher redshifts .",
    "this result only supports the authors dust argument in the case of our weak absorbers , the only sample in which the absorption incidence is significantly higher toward bright quasars than faint . for our weak sample ,",
    "the median absorption redshift is @xmath195 in the faint subsample and @xmath196 in the bright .",
    "ks testing , however , revealed that it could not be ruled out to a greater than 98.32% confidence level that the faint and bright subsamples are drawn from the same underlying @xmath86 distribution .",
    "though several authors have argued for an intrinsic origin for excess strong absorption toward grbs versus quasars , this does not appear to explain the @xmath4 discrepancy in the case of our bright and faint quasar populations .",
    "our @xcite testing revealed absorber distributions consistent with cosmological within all equivalent width and quasar absolute magnitude subsamples , as well as in the aggregate populations .",
    "the velocities of -selected gas ejected from a quasar would have to reach large fractions of the speed of light in order to pass for intervening systems .",
    "it therefore seems highly unlikely that significant intrinsic absorption could be present in our sample .",
    "we have found in a survey of 252 quasar spectra that the incidence of weak absorption evolves markedly , that it peaks at @xmath197 , and that it is fit by a function that is a product of the no - evolution expectation with a linear function .",
    "our linear fit to the ratio of our @xmath4 data to the nee resulted in a slope of @xmath96 and a normalization of @xmath97 for the function @xmath198 .",
    "our @xmath4 result predicts that no weak absorbers exist above @xmath6 .",
    "we find that when our quasar survey is segregated by absolute magnitude , weak @xmath4 is significantly lower in the faint subsample than in the bright , with faint to bright @xmath4 ratios of @xmath199 at low redshift and @xmath200 at high redshift .",
    "in contrast , strong @xmath4 is significantly _ higher _ in the faint subsample than in the bright , with faint to bright @xmath4 ratios of @xmath201 at low redshift and @xmath202 at high redshift .",
    "intermediate equivalent width absorbers exhibited @xmath4 ratios consistent with unity within 3 @xmath12 . at this time it is uncertain whether these results stem from some intrinsic property of the quasars , from some difference in the intervening sightlines , or from some combination of these factors .",
