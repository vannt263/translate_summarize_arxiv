    "meta - materials with simultaneously negative electric permittivity and magnetic permeability have recently received much attention .",
    "these materials can support a backwards - traveling wave where the phase propagation is antiparallel to the direction of energy flow .",
    "these materials have been identified by several names including left - handed or double - negative material but we shall refer to them here as backwards - wave ( bw ) materials .",
    "their properties were first considered theoretically by veselago@xcite during the 1960 s but they have only been fabricated recently @xcite . they are predicted to exhibit many unusual properties such as refraction at a negative angle , an inverse doppler shift , and a backwards oriented erenkov radiation cone@xcite .",
    "veselago@xcite also predicted that , under the conditions @xmath0 a parallel slab of this material could focus waves emitted from a point source and essentially act as a lens , albeit without magnification .",
    "these conditions are considered `` ideal '' because they lead to the same impedance and speed of light as free space .",
    "pendry @xcite pointed out that under these conditions incident decaying evanescent waves become growing inside the slab .",
    "the recovery of the evanescent waves allows the image resolution to be better than the diffraction limit and this material could theoretically produce a perfect image of the source , which lead pendry to call the system a `` perfect lens . '' a bw material must necessarily be dispersive@xcite and therefore all this would only work properly at certain frequencies , where the conditions of ( [ eq : ideal - condition ] ) are fulfilled . at these frequencies the meta - material slab not only compensates for the phase propagation of the waves , as a conventional lens does , but also compensates for the amplitude decay experienced by evanescent waves .",
    "this claim of growing evanescent waves and the possibility of a perfect lens has aroused much interest and given rise to much discussion of its correctness and feasibility , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "besides that , there is great interest and potential for applications in these materials beyond the issue of a perfect lens .    in this paper",
    "we study the behavior of an evanescent wave interacting with a slab of bw material via simulations .",

    "to be able to study the properties of evanescent waves interacting with a bw slab , we isolate a single evanescent wave by inserting the slab into a parallel plate waveguide and use excitation below the cutoff frequency of the waveguide . this way the wave in the waveguide is evanescent and its wave vector can be chosen through the width of the waveguide and the spatial profile of the source",

    "pec walls also exist at the sides of the computational domain but these are behind perfectly - matched layers ( pml ) which essentially allow the structure to mimic an open waveguide ( but the evanescent fields considered here decay rapidly enough that the performance of the pml is not a critical component in the simulation ) . the system is translationally invariant in the @xmath1 direction and can be treated as two - dimensional . a sheet current density @xmath3 at @xmath2 parallel to the @xmath4-@xmath1 plane acts as the source for the fields . as our interest is in the behavior of evanescent fields ,",
    "a single evanescent mode is excited using the spatial profile of a sheet current matched to that of the lowest order evanescent mode , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the dirac delta function and @xmath7 is the width of the waveguide . the source location and the waveguide width",

    "composite materials in which the effective electric permittivity and the effective magnetic permeability are both negative in some frequency interval have experimentally been shown to exist@xcite .",
    "based on this we assume that both the electric permittivity and the magnetic permeability are described by lorentz - type frequency dependences as @xmath9 here @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the plasma frequency , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the resonance frequency , and @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the absorption parameter of the permittivity and permeability , respectively . to simplify the model we choose @xmath16 and @xmath17 to coincide ,",
    "i.e. , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 . in the special case of @xmath21 , the conditions ( [ eq : ideal - condition ] ) are fulfilled at the design frequency @xmath22 we take ( [ eq:1 ] ) to define the relationship between the design frequency and the plasma frequency even when @xmath23 and @xmath24 are nonzero but small .    our attention",
    "is primarily concerned with the design frequency since this is the only frequency at which a perfect focus could possibly be achieved . at a frequency other than the design frequency",
    "the rate at which evanescent fields grow in the slab is not equal to the rate they decay in free space .",
    "thus for a source emitting multiple evanescent fields in front of the slab , there is no unique point on the other side of the slab at which the fields have obtained the same level as at the source ( i.e. , there is no unique image point ) .",
    "we assume that the material has abrupt edges and the change in constitutive parameters is instantaneous and collocated .",
    "the case of the change in the constitutive parameters of a bw slab not coinciding leads to a shift in the frequency of the nonreflecting wave and the bound modes of the slab@xcite .",
    "the fields of the bound modes decay exponentially away from the slab . the two bound modes with spatially decaying fields inside and outside the slab delimit a frequency interval that also contains a nonreflecting wave with exponential spatial dependence .",
    "for the material reaction to the field to be causal , the kramers - kronig relations @xcite show that for any deviation from free - space behavior the imaginary part of the permittivity or permeability can not vanish for all frequencies . on the other hand , as far as causality is concerned , it can be arbitrarily small .",
    "the numerical schemes used here are applied directly to maxwell s equations rather than to a wave equation .",
    "the first - order partial differential equations are discretized in time and space and an update algorithm is developed .",
    "specifically the behavior of the traditional yee finite - difference time - domain ( fdtd ) algorithm @xcite and the pseudospectral time - domain ( pstd ) method@xcite are studied . in both schemes",
    "the system is modeled as two dimensional and the open sides of the waveguide are modeled by using a causal uniaxial perfectly matched layer ( pml ) absorbing boundary @xcite .",
    "one significant difference between the two schemes lies in the grid location where the fields are sampled . in the pstd scheme",
    "the sample points of the fields are collocated while in the fdtd scheme they are staggered .",
    "the plates of the parallel plate waveguide are modeled as perfect electric conductors . on the pec boundary ,",
    "the tangential components of the electric field and the normal component of the magnetic field must vanish .",
    "the boundary conditions of the other components are given by surface charge density @xmath25 and surface current density @xmath26 , @xmath27 here @xmath28 is the surface normal unit vector .      in 1966 , yee@xcite proposed a discretization scheme for maxwell s equations based on a fully staggered grid , where the electric field components are each sampled on one of the edges of a cubical unit cell and the magnetic components each on one of the face centers . in this manner",
    "the spatial derivatives can be approximated as centered differences and one achieves second - order accuracy in the spatial step size@xcite .",
    "the pec boundary conditions are implemented by placing the boundary in a plane that contains the tangential electric field sampling points and then setting these components to zero . in this case , the tangential magnetic field components and the normal electric field component are not sampled on the boundary and one does not need to enforce any boundary condition on them .",
    "the normal component of the magnetic field is sampled on the boundary and is updated in the usual fashion .",
    "its boundary condition is automatically fulfilled through its dependence on the tangential electric field .",
    "owing to the staggering of the field components , the precise location of an interface where both the permittivity and permeability change is ambiguous .",
    "the case where a single material parameter , such as the permittivity , changes has been well - studied in the literature , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is well established that for a tangential field component collocated with the interface , the best approach is to use the arithmetic average of the material properties to either side .",
    "( it can also be shown , at least for the case of normal incidence , that if one is free to assign the material interface to fall halfway between tangential nodes , an abrupt change in the material parameters is optimum and , in fact , superior to averaging @xcite . ) for the study here , the precise location of the interface is not a primary concern . instead",
    ", the important issue is whether the evanescent fields exhibit the proper growth within the bw slab ( whatever its thickness or location ) .",
    "as reported in @xcite , averaging of material parameters has been used for modeling bw slabs with the yee algorithm .",
    "( in that work surface waves are present and no subwavelength imaging is seen . )",
    "figure [ fig : boundaries ] shows a portion of the computational grid as well as the material properties associated with each node  one must attribute a permeability to each magnetic field node and a permittivity to each electric field node .",
    "figure [ fig : boundaries](a ) shows the case of using abrupt discontinuities in the material parameters in the yee grid while ( b ) shows the case where averaging is used for the tangential node at the interface .",

    "( b ) the yee grid using averaging .",
    "the interface is assumed to be collocated with the @xmath32 node which uses the average permittivity to either side even though the introduction of a new material ( @xmath33 ) arguably creates an additional interface further to the left .",
    "( c ) the pstd grid . because the grid is not staggered",
    ", the boundary between the two regions is unambiguously assumed to exist between the nodes which employ the different material parameters.,width=336 ]      in pseudospectral techniques a discrete fourier transform is used to calculate the spatial derivatives in the discretized version of a partial differential equation .",
    "time integration is achieved using the same second - order time - stepping approach as used in the yee algorithm . unlike the yee algorithm where central - differences are used , in pstd",
    "the spatial derivatives are calculated at the same location as the field .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundaries](c ) , for maxwell s equations this means that the electric and the magnetic field components are all sampled at the same location , i.e. , in the center of a cubic unit cell .",
    "an important problem with this approach is that the use of exponential fourier transforms inherently introduces periodic boundary conditions that are often undesired .",
    "this problem can be avoided by covering the numerical domain boundaries with a pml layer such that the waves are absorbed in the pml before they can contaminate the simulation through the periodic boundaries@xcite .",
    "this gives one a tool to simulate open domains .",
    "if the system contains pec boundaries , the problem becomes much more difficult .",
    "nonetheless , in a two - dimensional system in transverse electric ( te ) polarization , i.e. , @xmath34 perpendicular to the plane , which is source - free near the boundaries , one can show that the pec boundary conditions ( eqs .",
    "[ eq:2][eq:5 ] ) imply that @xmath35 here @xmath28 is the surface normal unit vector and @xmath36 is the derivative in that direction .",
    "conditions ( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:6 ] ) can be easily enforced with fourier sine and cosine transforms if one chooses fourier sine transforms for the tangential electric field components and fourier cosine transforms for the tangential magnetic field components .",
    "no spatial derivatives of normal components appear and no boundary condition needs to be enforced on them .",
    "thus , in a two - dimensional system in te polarization , the pec boundary conditions are conveniently implemented through the choice of fourier transform .",
    "the discrete fourier transform has problems representing a delta function , discretized as a kronecker delta , correctly .",
    "for this reason it is advantageous to use a spatially smoothed rather than a highly localized source @xcite to represent the source screen of ( [ eq : source - profile ] ) .",
    "this problem also appears when a sudden change in material parameters leads to a sudden change in the fields . in the simulations",
    "one observes wiggles or ripples on the signal that can become significant if the change in field is strong .",
    "this artifact is the gibbs phenomenon associated with the fourier transforms .      to achieve negative @xmath37 and negative @xmath38 in a material ,",
    "this material must necessarily be dispersive @xcite . in our model system we chose lorentz dispersion characteristics ( [ eq : lorentz - material - e],[eq : lorentz - material - m ] ) @xcite .",
    "there are several commonly used methods to implement frequency dependence in a time - domain algorithm , e.g. , the auxiliary differential equation ( ade ) method@xcite , the recursive convolution method @xcite , and the z transform method @xcite . in this study",
    "we use the ade method , the z transform method , and two frequency approximation methods@xcite . here",
    "we present the update for the electric field ; analogous equations hold for the magnetic field . in the following , @xmath39 will denote the temporal step size of the discretization scheme .",
    "one approach to implement a frequency dependent response in a discrete time - domain method is to transform the frequency - domain constitutive parameters into the time domain and then approximate the derivatives with differences based on taylor series expansions @xcite .",
    "the frequency dispersion ( [ eq : lorentz - material - e ] ) at any given electric field node inside the material slab is implemented as @xmath40{0pt}{20pt }      4 e^{n-1 } -\\left[\\left(\\omega_p^2+\\omega_0 ^ 2\\right )      \\delta_t^2-\\gamma\\delta_t+2\\right ] e^{n-2 } \\right\\}\\nonumber\\\\    \\hspace{-0.095 in } & & \\hspace{-0.095 in } \\mbox { }      \\times \\left[\\left(\\omega_p^2+\\omega_0 ^ 2\\right )      \\delta_t^2+\\gamma\\delta_t+2\\right]^{-1},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath41 is the electric flux density which must be stored as a separate quantity .",
    "the superscripts on the fields denote the time step at which the field values are taken .",
    "the z transform is essentially a more general version of the discrete fourier transform .",
    "it is strictly based on a sampled signal and provides an exact transformation between sample domain and z domain . for frequency dependencies of the debye , plasma , and lorentz type and even some types of non -",
    "linearities it allows one to derive exact update algorithms ( i.e. , exact in the sampled sense ) for the sampled signal @xcite .",
    "the frequency dispersion of ( [ eq : lorentz - material - e ] ) is implemented as @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 is an auxiliary field .",
    "this implementation is applicable for real @xmath46 , i.e. , when the system response function is a damped sine wave .",
    "when @xmath46 is imaginary , the character of the response function changes and the z transform has to be implemented differently @xcite .      another common method to derive discrete time - domain update equations for the frequency dependence of a system",
    "is frequency approximation .",
    "here one starts with the frequency domain expression for the system response and makes the transition to the discretized time domain by replacing each occurrence of @xmath47 by @xmath48 , i.e. , a linear backward difference where @xmath49 represents a shift back in time of one temporal step @xcite .",
    "when the frequency dependence becomes complicated this method can make the derivation of update equations much easier than the z transform method . on the other hand , in general , while it does not significantly change the computational burden , it introduces new error . a bilinear approximation , @xmath50 ,",

    "using such a fine discretization is typically unnecessary when simulating propagating waves , where it is more customary to use approximately 20 points per wavelength , but because evanescent waves have rapid amplitude decay and also phase variations ( transverse to the amplitude decay ) that have wavelengths smaller than the propagating free - space wavelength , it can be necessary to use a finer discretization to model these waves accurately .",

    "the field is clearly amplified exponentially inside the bw slab and decays exponentially outside of it . upon close inspection",
    "one finds that the magnitude of the electric field at the object location is approximately 28 , while it is about 26 at the image location .",
    "this discrepancy is due to the slower speed of light in the bw material at this frequency .",
    "thus , the exponential growth inside the slab is slower than the decay outside of it and , though the field is amplified in the slab , the amplification does not accurately compensate for the decay in free space .",
    "the magnitude of this discrepancy as well as the frequency at which the nonreflecting wave occurs is dependent on the wavevector of the field @xcite .",
    "thus , it is not possible to define a single corrected image location that holds for all wavevectors ( this is true of both the propagating and evanescent components ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : yeeavgnrw ] shows the nonreflecting wave when averaging is used for the boundary . here the nonreflecting wave was found to occur at @xmath78 , i.e. , above the design frequency .",

    "we attribute this difference to the effect the discretization has on the transmission and reflection coefficient of each interface .",
    "( this is in addition to introducing transition layers into the system . ) when averaging is used , the nonreflecting frequency is above the design frequency , but the offset between the two frequencies is approximately the same as when the abrupt boundary is used .",
    "thus there does not appear to be an obvious advantage to using averaging when modeling a bw slab since neither yields the correct behavior at the design frequency .",

    "all field components are collocated and there is no transition layer at a material interface .",
    "using the ade method to implement the frequency dispersion of the bw material we observe that the nonreflecting wave occurs at the design frequency , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pstd - nonreflecting ] . because the wave vector magnitudes inside and outside the material are nearly equal ( with slight discrepancy due to loss and a nonzero resonance frequency )",

    "arguably , for either the averaged or abrupt boundary , this provides a transition layer thickness of only @xmath80 in the yee scheme and yet it still produces a significant enough frequency shift for the nonreflecting wave that realization of a perfect planar lens is essentially impossible .",
    "the analysis in @xcite shows that in the limit of vanishing layer thickness the frequency of the nonreflecting wave goes to the design frequency in the continuous case .",
    "nevertheless , for all practical discretization levels the influence of the transition layer remains significant .",
    "there have been reports of the yee scheme being used to model evanescent fields in bw materials @xcite , but the level of discretization that had to be used was on the order of 566 cells per propagating wavelength @xcite which may be prohibitive for most applications .",

    "thus the major difference between the schemes considered here is the treatment of the interface and one can not attribute the superior results of the pstd scheme to its superior dispersion .      in sec .",
    "[ sec : dispersion - implementation ] we discussed four different implementations of the frequency dependence of the permeability and permittivity . to compare their performance , we use each one in a simulation using the pstd scheme at the design frequency , with the parameters given at the beginning of sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] . in this configuration one expects the reflected wave at the first interface ( @xmath75 ) to vanish , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pstd - nonreflecting ] . in fig .",
    "[ fig : compare - dispersion - pstd ] we show the electric field in these simulations .",
    "it is apparent that the ade , the z transform , and the bilinear frequency approximation all give good results .",
    "no reflected wave is visible and upon inspection one finds that the magnitudes at the object and image location are essentially equal . when plotted without offset",
    "the three curves fall on top of one another .",
    "the linear frequency approximation on the other hand does show a significant amplitude for the reflected wave .",
    "the field at the image location is also much weaker than at the object location .",
    "this effect is probably due to the numerical phase error inherent in this method @xcite .",
    "this shows that the use of the linear frequency approximation is problematic in simulations involving bw materials , while many of the other common dispersive material implementations work well .",
    "we have studied the finite - difference time - domain and the pseudospectral time - domain methods in the context of evanescent waves in the presence of a backward - wave material .",
    "our simulations verify that the predicted growth of the evanescent field inside the bw material , which is vital for imaging beyond the diffraction limit , does occur .",
    "we found that the yee fdtd method suffers from a transition layer effect due to the inherent staggered grid , even when using an averaging technique at the material interface , while the collocated grid used in the pstd method avoids this numerical artifact .",
    "the choice of numerical technique to implement the frequency dependence of the permittivity and the permeability is also important for the correct modeling of the bw material .",
    "thus , we have shown that the pstd method in concert with the ade technique , the z transform technique , or the bilinear frequency approximation , allows one to accurately model the interaction of a bw slab with an evanescent wave .",
