    "entanglement is the key resource of quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "entangled qubits are required for many important branches of qip , such as quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum key distribution ( qkd ) @xcite , quantum secure direct communication ( qsdc ) @xcite , and quantum repeaters @xcite .",
    "recently , the multi - particle systems attract more and more attentions . for instance , the greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state is one of the most important resources in qip . due to the large information capacity",
    ", ghz states play an important role in the foundations of quantum mechanics measurement theory and quantum communication @xcite . in practical applications ,",
    "the ideal quantum states are the maximally entangled states . however , due to the environmental noise , the decoherence problem is inevitable in practical applications .",
    "the decoherence greatly limits the building of high - quality quantum channel , even more , it may cause the quantum communication insecure . for dealing with the decoherence problem",
    ", people proposed large number of approaches , such as entanglement purification @xcite , entanglement concentration @xcite , and entanglement amplification @xcite .",
    "recently , a new kind of multi - particle quantum state , which is called the concatenated greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( c - ghz ) state has attracted high attention @xcite .",
    "it is also called the macroscopic schrdinger s cat superposed state . for the common quantum states ,",
    "people usually encode quantum qubit in physical qubit directly , while for the c - ghz state , the parties encode many physical qubits in a logic qubit .",
    "the typical c - ghz state can be written as @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath2 are the logic qubit number and physical qubit number in each logic qubit , respectively .",
    "this c - ghz state shows similar features as the common ghz state .",
    "however , comparing with common ghz state , the c - ghz state has a highly attractive feature , that is , it is robust to the decoherence in a noisy environment @xcite . due to the robust feature",
    ", the c - ghz state has great application potential in the future long - distance quantum communication . in 2014 , lu _",
    "_ demonstrated the first experiment to prepare the c - ghz state with @xmath3 and @xmath4 in an optical system .",
    "they also verified that the c - ghz state can tolerate more bit - flip and phase shift noise than polarized ghz state .",
    "therefore , the c - ghz state is useful for large - scale fibre - based quantum networks and multipartite qkd schemes @xcite .    the quantum state analysis , which is the discrimination between the maximally entangled quantum states is quite important in various applications .",
    "the most common quantum state analysis is called the bell - state analysis ( bsa ) , which is for the two - particle entangled system .",
    "there are usually three different kinds of methods to realize the bsa .",
    "the first one is totally in linear optics @xcite .",
    "however , the success probability of the bsa approaches with only linear optical elements can only reach 50% , so that the first kind of bsa approaches can not perform complete bsa @xcite .",
    "the second kind of methods still requires the linear optical elements but resorts to the hyperentanglement @xcite .",
    "for example , in 2003 , walborn _ et al .",
    "_ once proposed a hyperentanglement - assisted bsa approach . in their approach ,",
    "the hyperentangled state is prepared in polarization and momentum degrees of freedom .",
    "they can realize the complete bsa for both the momentum and polarization entangled bell - states @xcite .",
    "the third kind of methods adopt the nonlinear optical elements , such as the cross - kerr nonlinearity and the quantum - dot system @xcite to realize the complete bsa .",
    "for example , some groups adopt the cross - kerr nonlinearity to construct the complete parity - check measurement ( pcm ) gate , which can distinguish the even parity states @xmath5 and @xmath6 from the odd parity states @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "although the analysis for ghz states has been widely discussed @xcite , most analysis protocols can not deal with the c - ghz states .",
    "recently , sheng and zhou proposed two complete bsa protocols for the c - ghz state with the help of the controlled - not ( cnot ) gate and the cross - kerr nonlinearity , respectively @xcite . unfortunately , the cnot gate and the cross - kerr nonlinearity are difficult to realize in current experimental condition , which limits the application of the two analysis protocols .",
    "proposed a partially bsa protocol for another type of logic - qubit entanglement in the linear optics @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "the cavity quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) is a promising platform for performing quantum information tasks , due to the controllable interaction between atoms and photons . in 2009 , the group of an successfully implemented qip based on the photonic faraday rotation @xcite .",
    "this method works in the low - quality ( q ) cavities and only involves the virtual excitation of atoms .",
    "therefore , it is insensitive to both the cavity decay and the atomic spontaneous emission . following this scheme , various works based on the photonic faraday rotation effect in the low - q cavity",
    "have been presented , such as quantum logic gate @xcite , qip in decoherence - free subspace @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , and entanglement detection @xcite .",
    "recently , with the help of faraday rotation , wei and deng designed some compact quantum gates @xcite .",
    "their works proved that the universal quantum computation can be realized .",
    "recently , we proposed a complete logic bell - state analysis ( lbsa ) protocol with the help of the photonic faraday rotation in low - q cavity @xcite .",
    "actually , the logic bell - state is the special case of the c - ghz state with @xmath9 . in this paper",
    ", we will put forward a complete analysis protocol for the c - ghz state with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 based on the photonic faraday rotation in low - q cavity . due to the attractive possible applications of the c - ghz state",
    ", our analysis may be useful in the future qip field .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we will introduce the basic principle of the photonic faraday rotation . in section 3",
    ", we will describe our complete analysis protocol for arbitrary c - ghz state in detail . in section 4 ,",
    "we make a discussion and conclusion .",
    "and two degenerate ground states @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the transition between @xmath10 and @xmath12 is assisted with a left - circularly polarized photon ( @xmath13 ) , and the transition between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is assisted with a right - circularly polarized photon ( @xmath14 ) , respectively .",
    "( b).,width=264 ]    our analysis protocol is based on the photonic faraday rotation in low - q cavity . in this way",
    ", we first introduce its basic principle briefly . as shown in fig .",
    "1 , a three - level atom is trapped in the one - side low - q cavity .",
    "the states @xmath10 and @xmath11 represent the two zeeman sublevels of its degenerate ground state , and @xmath12 represents its excited state .",
    "a single photon pulse with frequency @xmath15 enters the cavity and reacts with the three - level atom .",
    "the transition between @xmath10 and @xmath12 is assisted with a left - circularly polarized photon ( @xmath13 ) , and the transition between @xmath11 and @xmath12 is assisted with a right - circularly polarized photon ( @xmath14 ) , respectively .    based on the researches of res .",
    "@xcite , by solving the langevin equations of motion for cavity and atomic lowering operators analytically , we can obtain the general expression of the reflection coefficient of the atom - cavity system in the form of @xmath16[i(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{p})+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}]+\\lambda^{2 } } { [ i(\\omega_{c}-\\omega_{p})+\\frac{\\kappa}{2}][i(\\omega_{0}-\\omega_{p})+\\frac{\\gamma}{2}]+\\lambda^{2}}.\\label{r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the cavity input operator and cavity output operator , respectively . @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the cavity damping rate and atomic decay rate , respectively .",
    "@xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the frequency of the cavity and the atom , respectively , and @xmath23 is the atom - cavity coupling strength . from eq .",
    "( [ r ] ) , if the atom uncouples to the cavity , which makes @xmath24 , we can simplify @xmath25 to @xmath26 eq .",
    "( [ r0 ] ) can be written as a pure phase shift @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , in the interaction process , as the photon experiences an extremely weak absorption , we can consider that the output reflected photon only experiences a pure phase shift without any absorption . in this way",
    ", the expression of @xmath25 can be simplified to @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , if the photon pulse takes action , the output photon state will convert to @xmath29 , otherwise , the single - photon would only sense the empty cavity , and the output photon state will convert to @xmath30 .    in this way , for an input single - photon state @xmath31 , if the initial atom state is @xmath10 , the output photon state can evolve to latexmath:[\\ ] ]    then , the parties prepare an atom named atom `` n '' in the ground state of @xmath156 and make it trap in a low - q cavity .",
    "the parties make all the photons after the hwps successively pass through the low - q cavity and interact with the atom `` n '' . after the interaction ,",
    "the parties measure the atom `` n '' . if the atom state is @xmath10 , the photon state must be @xmath157 , and the initial photon state is @xmath158 .",
    "if the atom state is @xmath110 , the photon state is @xmath159 , and the initial photon state must be @xmath160 . on the other hand , for @xmath148 , if we obtain other measurement results in the first step , such as @xmath161 , the initial state will collapse to @xmath162 .",
    "we only need to distinguish @xmath163 . in this way , after performing a bit - flip operation on the photon in the @xmath117 mode , we can transform @xmath163 to@xmath164 .",
    "therefor , for all the cases corresponding to @xmath141 measurement results , @xmath148 can be distinguished with the same approach .    if the initial state is @xmath165 @xmath166 , in the second step , the parties can also transform the photon states which need to be measured into @xmath167 with the help of the bit - flip operation .",
    "therefore , all the @xmath129 c - ghz states can be completely distinguished based on the measurement results of both two steps .",
    "certainly , our analysis protocol can also completely distinguish the c - ghz states with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "as described above , before the first analysis step , the parties need to first perform @xmath122 hadamard operation on the @xmath122 photons in each logic qubit and then measure the @xmath122 photons in the basis of @xmath125 . after the measurement ,",
    "@xmath123 will become @xmath126 under the case that the number of @xmath14 is even .",
    "@xmath123 will become @xmath127 when the number of @xmath14 is odd . in this way",
    ", we can transform @xmath168 into @xmath165 , and realize the complete analysis with the principle of the section .",
    "in the paper , we proposed a complete analysis protocol for the c - ghz states with arbitrary @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "our protocol includes two steps . before the first step ,",
    "we need to perform @xmath122 hadamard operation on @xmath122 photons in each logic qubit , and measure them in the basis of @xmath125 . after the measurement",
    ", we can transform the c - ghz states with arbitrary @xmath2 @xmath169 into the c - ghz states with @xmath42 . in both two steps",
    ", we essentially make parity check for the photon states with the help of the photo - atom interaction in low - q cavities . in the first step , we require @xmath128 three - level atoms trapped in @xmath128 low - q cavities , respectively , and make all the photons in the @xmath170 spatial modes enter the cavities to interact with the atoms , respectively .",
    "after the photon - atom interaction , we can divide the @xmath129 c - ghz states into @xmath141 groups according to measurement results of the atomic states . in the second step ,",
    "we only require one three - level atom trapped in a low - q cavity , and make the @xmath1 photons in the @xmath171 modes enter the cavity and interact with the atom , successively .",
    "after the photon - atom interaction , we measure the atom state . in this way",
    ", we can distinguish the two states in each of the @xmath141 groups based on the measurement results of the atomic state .",
    "therefore , we can completely distinguish the @xmath129 c - ghz states according to the atomic states measurement results in both two analysis steps .    in our protocol",
    ", we essentially construct the parity check gate based on the photonic faraday rotation in low - q cavity .",
    "fortunately , the photonic faraday rotation in low - q cavity has been experimentally realized in some recent research works .",
    "for example , in 2005 , the group of nu@xmath172mann once reported their experiment to precisely control and adjust the individual ultracold @xmath173 atoms coupled to a high - finesse optical cavity @xcite .",
    "the states of @xmath174 .",
    "@xmath175 of the @xmath176 are chosen to be the two ground states @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the transition frequency between the ground states and the excited state at @xmath177 is controlled as @xmath178 , and the cavity length , cavity rate and the finesse are kept as @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 , respectively . later , fortier _ et al .",
    "_ experimentally realized the deterministic loading of single @xmath182 atoms into the cavity by incorporating a deterministic loaded atom conveyor @xcite .",
    "in the same year , colombe _ et al .",
    "_ also reported their experiment on realizing the strong atom - field coupling for bose - einstein condensates ( bec ) in a fiber - based fabry - perot ( f - p ) cavity on a chip @xcite .",
    "they showed that the @xmath182 bec can be positioned deterministically anywhere within the cavity and localized entirely within a single antinode of the standing - wave cavity field . based on their attractive experimental results",
    ", our analysis protocol may be realized experimentally in the near future .    in theory ,",
    "our analysis protocol can completely distinguish the @xmath129 c - ghz states with the success probability of @xmath183 .",
    "however , in practical experimental conditions , some imperfections are still existed .",
    "for example , the first kind of imperfection may come from the practical cavity condition . in our protocol , in order to obtain the input - output relationship as eq .",
    "( [ relation ] ) , the frequency of the input coherent state @xmath15 should satisfy @xmath184 , and the photon - atom coupling strength should meet @xmath38 . in practical experimental condition ,",
    "the deviation of resonance @xmath185 , and mismatch of coupling strength @xmath186 may change the phase shift of photonic faraday rotation as @xmath187 , where @xmath188 is a small quantity . based on the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , the exist of @xmath188 will cause errors in both two analysis steps . fortunately , based on the experimental results from refs .",
    "@xcite , we can control the reflectivity of the input coherent state by manipulating the position of a single @xmath182 and precisely tuning the atom - cavity coupling strength . in this way",
    ", the value of @xmath188 can be controlled very small , and the error probability ( @xmath189 ) can be controlled quite low . on the other hand , the imperfections may also come from the detection efficiency for both the single - photon and single - atom measurement .",
    "the detection efficiency indicates when the single photon ( atom ) enters the single - photon ( atom ) detector , the detector can register it with the probability of @xmath190 . in current experimental condition ,",
    "neither the single - photon detection efficiency ( @xmath191 ) nor the single - atom detection efficiency ( @xmath192 ) can reach 100% . in our protocol , we need to measure the states of @xmath122 photons in each logic qubit prior to the discrimination and measure the states of @xmath193 three - level atoms in two steps .",
    "if the photon ( atom ) detector does not register the photon ( atom ) , it will cause a failure of our protocol . according to the above two imperfection factors",
    ", we can calculate the total success probability ( @xmath194 ) of our protocol as @xmath195 recently , many research works about the single - atom and single - photon detections have been reported .",
    "for example , in 2010 , heine _",
    "_ reported that they have achieved @xmath196 in the experiment .",
    "moreover , they have shown that with some improvement , the single atom detection efficiency can achieve @xmath197 in theory @xcite .",
    "the single photon detection has been a challenge under current experimental conditions , for the quantum decoherence effect of the photon detector @xcite .",
    "_ reported their experimental result about the near - infrared single - photon detection .",
    "they showed the @xmath191 at 1556 @xmath198 can reach @xmath199 @xcite .",
    "based on their results , we make the numerical simulation on the @xmath194 of our protocol .",
    "we assume @xmath200 and @xmath201 . in this way",
    ", we can calculate that @xmath202 , @xmath203 , and @xmath204 .",
    "therefore , it can be found that with the growth of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , @xmath194 will decrease largely .    in conclusion , we proposed a completely analysis protocol for the arbitrary c - ghz states with the help of some auxiliary single atoms trapped in the low - q cavities .",
    "the protocol includes two steps . in both two steps",
    ", we essentially adopt the qed in low - q cavity , say the photonic faraday rotation to perform the parity check for the photonic states . in the first step",
    ", we can divide the @xmath129 c - ghz states into @xmath141 groups according to different measurement results of the @xmath128 auxiliary single atoms . in the second step",
    ", we can distinguish the two c - ghz states in each of @xmath141 groups based on the measurement result of another auxiliary single atom . in this way",
    ", our protocol can completely distinguish all the @xmath129 c - ghz states .",
    "in ideal experimental condition , the success probability of our protocol can reach 100% , and the number of physical qubit encoded in each logic qubit does not affect the protocol . as we can increase the number of physical qubit in each logic qubit to resist the environmental noise ,",
    "this robust feature make our protocol quite useful in the point to point quantum communication based on logic - qubit entanglement .",
