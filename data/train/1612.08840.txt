    "since its inception by robin forman @xcite , discrete morse theory has been a powerful and versatile tool used not only in diverse fields of mathematics , but also in applications to other areas @xcite as well as a computational tool @xcite .",
    "its adaptability stems in part from the fact that it is a discrete version of the beautiful and successful `` smooth '' morse theory @xcite .",
    "while smooth morse theory touches many branches of math , one such area that has its origins in critical point theory is that of lusternik  schnirelmann category .",
    "the ( smooth ) lusternik  schnirelmann category or l  s category of a smooth manifold @xmath1 , denoted @xmath2 , was first introduced in @xcite , where the authors proved what is now known as the lusternik ",
    "schnirelmann theorem ( see also @xcite for a detailed survey of the topic ) . a version of this result can be stated as follows :    if @xmath3 is a compact smooth manifold and @xmath4 is a smooth map , then @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the set of all critical points of the function @xmath7 .",
    "there are many `` smooth '' versions of this theorem in various contexts ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "the aim of this paper is to view forman s discrete morse theory from a different perspective in order to prove a discrete version of the l  s theorem compatible with the recently defined simplicial l  s category developed by three of the authors @xcite .",
    "this simplicial version of l  s category is suitable for simplicial complexes .",
    "other attempts have been made to develop such a `` discrete '' l  s category . in @xcite , one of the authors developed a discrete version of l  s category and proved an analogous l ",
    "s theorem for discrete morse functions .",
    "our version of the l  s theorem , theorem [ sls theorem ] , relates a new generalized notion of critical object of a discrete morse function to the simplicial l  s category of @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we use the notion of simplicial l  s category defined in @xcite .",
    "this simplicial approach of l  s category uses strong collapses in the sense of barmak and minian @xcite as a framework for developing categorical sets . as opposed to standard collapses ,",
    "strong collapses are natural to consider in the simplicial setting since they correspond to simplicial maps ( see figure  [ strong_collapse ] ) .     to @xmath8 .",
    "]    this is especially contrasted with ( standard ) elementary collapses , which in general do not correspond to simplicial maps ( see figure  [ standard_collapse ] ) .     to @xmath9 . ]    furthermore , elementary strong collapses correspond to the deletion of the open star of a dominated vertex .",
    "notice that in general , the deletion of a vertex is not a simplicial map .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ fundamentals of simplicial complexes ] contains the necessary background and basics of simplicial complexes and collapsibility .",
    "section [ strong discrete morse theory ] is devoted to both reviewing discrete morse theory and introducing a generalized notion of critical object in this context .",
    "here we develop a collapsing theorem for discrete morse functions which is analogous to the classical result of forman ( theorem 3.3 of @xcite ) .",
    "section [ simplicial lusternik ",

    "in this section we review some of the basics of simplicial complexes ( see @xcite for a more detailed exposition ) .",
    "let us start with the definition of simplicial complex .",
    "the more usual way to introduce this notion is to do it geometrically .",
    "first , let us introduce the basic building blocks , that is , the notion of a simplex . given @xmath10 points @xmath11 in general position in an euclidean space , the @xmath12-simplex @xmath13 generated by them , @xmath14 ,",
    "is defined as their convex hull . a simplex",
    "@xmath13 contains lower dimensional simplices @xmath15 , denoted by @xmath16 , called faces just by considering the corresponding simplices generated by any subset of its vertices . a simplicial",
    "complex is a collection of simplices satisfying two conditions :    * every face of simplex in a complex is also a simplex of the complex . * if two simplices in a complex intersect , then the intersection is also a simplex of the complex .    alternatively , it is possible to define a simplicial complex abstractly .",
    "it will avoid confusion when parts of the simplicial structure are removed .    given a finite set @xmath17:=\\{0,1,2,3,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] , an",
    "_ abstract simplicial complex @xmath0 on @xmath17 $ ] _ is a collection of subsets of @xmath17 $ ] such that :    * if @xmath18 and @xmath19 , then @xmath20 . * @xmath21 for every @xmath22 $ ] .",
    "the set @xmath17 $ ] is called the _ vertex set _ of @xmath0 and the elements @xmath23 are called _ vertices _ or _ @xmath24-simplices . _ we also may write @xmath25 to denote the vertex set of @xmath0 .",
    "an element @xmath18 of cardinality @xmath26 is called an _ @xmath27-dimensional simplex _ or _",
    "@xmath27-simplex _ of @xmath0 . the _ dimension _ of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath28 , is the maximum of the dimensions of all its simplices .",
    "let @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "define @xmath31    @xmath32 .",
    "this abstract simplicial complex may be regarded geometrically as follows :        further definitions are in order .",
    "a _ subcomplex _ @xmath33 of @xmath0 , denoted @xmath34 , is a subset @xmath33 of @xmath0 such that @xmath33 is also a simplicial complex .",
    "we use @xmath35 to denote a simplex of dimension @xmath27 , and we write @xmath36 to denote any subsimplex of @xmath13 of dimension strictly less than @xmath27 . if @xmath37 with @xmath38 , then @xmath15 is a _ face _ of @xmath13 and @xmath13 is a _ coface _ of @xmath15 . a simplex of @xmath0 that is not properly contained in any other simplex of @xmath0",

    "collapsible_.    now we introduce some basic subcomplexes related to a vertex .",
    "they play analogous role in the simplicial setting as the closed ball , sphere , and open ball play in the continuous approach .",

    "the _ star of @xmath46 in @xmath0 _ , denoted @xmath47 , is the subcomplex of simplices @xmath18 such that @xmath48 .",

    "it is important to point out that simplicial collapses are not simplicial maps in general .",
    "this suggests that it is natural to consider a special kind of collapse which is a simplicial map .",
    "the notion of strong collapse , introduced by barmak and minian in @xcite , satisfies this requirement .",
    "let @xmath0 be a simplicial complex and suppose there exists a pair of vertices @xmath56 such that every maximal simplex containing @xmath46 also contains @xmath57 .",

    "this retraction is called an _ elementary strong collapse _ from @xmath0 to @xmath62 , denoted by @xmath63 .    a _ strong collapse _ is a finite sequence of elementary strong collapses .",
    "the inverse of a strong collapse is called a _ strong expansion _ and two complexes @xmath0 and @xmath33 _ have the same strong homotopy type _ if there is a sequence of strong collapses and strong expansions that transform @xmath0 into @xmath33 .",
    "see figure  [ strong_collapse ] to illustrate the above notions .",
    "equivalently , @xmath46 is a dominated vertex if and only if its link is a cone @xcite .",
