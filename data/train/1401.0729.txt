    "in the cases of at least ten nearby ( redshift @xmath3 ) lgrbs , observations have revealed a sn  ic - bl spectrum superimposed on the power - law continuum of the fading optical afterglow ( @xcite ; see @xcite and @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "the spectra are characterized by wide features consistent with high ejecta velocities ( @xmath420,00030,000kms@xmath5 ) , and an absence of hydrogen and helium .",
    "the other principal classes of core - collapse sn , in contrast , exhibit spectroscopic features consistent with more slowly moving ejecta .",
    "the most common core - collapse sn are type  ii ( @xmath6% ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which exhibit hydrogen ( h ) in their spectra ; they are the final eruptions of stars that have retained their outer h shell .",
    "when the progenitor sheds , transfers to a companion , or internally mixes its outer h envelope during pre - sn evolution , the explosion will produce an h - deficient sn  ib , or an h- and he - deficient sn  ic ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    while the absence of h and he in the spectra of sn  ic - bl indicates that their progenitors have lost their envelopes prior to core collapse",
    ", simulations additionally suggest that the progenitors of sn  ic - bl with associated lgrbs may also have rapid speeds of rotation . in models , only quickly rotating stars without an h envelope produce the outflowing jets that yield @xmath7-ray emission @xcite after core collapse to a black hole @xcite .",
    "close massive binary systems that experience mass transfer , common - envelope evolution , or a merger @xcite are possible progenitors of lgrbs , because they can likely produce the required rapidly rotating massive stars without h or he envelopes .",
    "recent observations of galactic o - type stars show that , in fact , @xmath8% of massive stars experience mass transfer with a companion and @xmath9% undergo a merger @xcite .",
    "alternative progenitor candidates include quickly rotating , metal - poor stars that internally mix their outer envelopes @xcite .",
    "single stars with high abundances , however , are considered improbable progenitors , because their comparatively strong winds @xcite are expected to reduce their angular momentum .",
    "spectroscopy of @xmath10 host galaxies shows , in fact , that nearby sn  ic - bl with an associated grb prefer more metal - poor environments than nearby type  ic - bl sn having no obvious @xmath7-ray emission @xcite .",
    "the latter , in turn , prefer more metal - poor @xcite and blue @xcite environments than do sn  ic without broad features .",
    "in several cases , however , the positions of low- and moderate - redshift lgrbs are spatially coincident or closely associated with massive , metal - rich galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",

    "grb 130702a @xcite occurred , however , in a metal - poor faint satellite of a @xmath13 massive galaxy @xcite , raising the possibilty of superpositions or associations for some lgrbs that would be difficult to resolve at high redshift .    here",

    "we estimate these host properties from published photometry and archival _ hst _ images . we show that sn ic - bl and lgrbs exhibit a strong preference for galaxies that have high stellar - mass density and star - formation - rate density for their stellar mass .",
    "we also use sdss spectra to show that the gas kinematics of sn  ic - bl hosts are exceptional . in  [ sec : data ] , we describe the core - collapse sn and lgrb samples as well as the sdss and _ hst _ galaxy data that we use in this analysis .",

    "we study the host galaxies of both nearby ( @xmath1 ) core - collapse sn discovered by `` galaxy - untargeted '' transient searches ( e.g. , the palomar transient factory ; ptf ; @xcite ) which do not target specific potential hosts , and @xmath2 lgrbs detected by @xmath7-ray satellites .",
    "we use the sdss spectroscopic sample to build a control sample of low - redshift star - forming galaxies , and sdss photometry and spectroscopy to measure properties of both the sample of low - redshift star - forming galaxies and the host galaxies of the nearby sn . for the host galaxies of @xmath14 lgrbs , we estimate host properties using published photometry and _ hst _ imaging .",

    "objects detected with @xmath26 significance in the imaging survey , with an extended light distribution and having @xmath16-band magnitude brighter than 17.77 , as well as qso candidates and luminous red galaxies ( lrgs ) , formed the legacy samples @xcite .",

    "the core - collapse sn sample is constructed from @xmath28 discoveries by sn surveys that do not target specific galaxies .",
    "the `` galaxy - untargeted '' sn search technique is akin to that of wide - field @xmath7-ray satellite ( e.g. , _ swift _ ) searches for lgrbs .",
    "the sn in our sample consist of discoveries by galaxy - untargeted searches reported to the international astronomical union ( iau ) , as well as those published @xcite or reported via astronomical telegrams by the ptf , from 1990 january 1 through 2012 may 10 .",
    "the sn searches that we considered to be galaxy - untargeted are identical those listed by @xcite .",
    "our sample consists of only those nearby sn whose host galaxies have sdss @xmath15 imaging and , when appropriate , a fiber spectrum .",
    "the probability of detecting a sn in an image depends on the limiting magnitude of the transient search , as well as on the sn distance , luminosity , light - curve shape , and dust attenuation along the line of sight .",
    "comparative analysis of the redshifts of core - collapse sn discovered by galaxy - untargeted searches found no significant evidence that variation among the principal species strongly affects their discovery rate @xcite .",
    "@xcite showed that sn  ic are more closely associated with the highest surface brightness regions of their host galaxies than sn  ib , but here we combine these two sn types to assemble a larger sample of stripped - envelope sn that do not show high ejecta velocities .",
    "we also show , for comparison , the host of ptf12gzk , a peculiar sn  ic that did not exhibit broad spectroscopic features @xcite but in which radio observations found evidence for @xmath29 ejecta speeds @xcite .",

    "our lgrb sample includes both objects with a detected optical afterglow , and `` dark '' bursts without a luminous optical afterglow @xcite whose position was determined using their x - ray flux @xcite .",
    "analysis of the host galaxies of dark grbs shows that they are both more massive @xcite and dust - obscured @xcite than the hosts of grbs with detected optical afterglows .",
    "the fraction of dark bursts in our sample ( ) is approximately representative of the fraction of dust - obscured grbs below the @xmath30 redshift upper limit of our lgrb sample reported by @xcite .",
    "we assemble @xmath2 lgrb host galaxies having archival _ hst _ images from the unobscured lgrbs assembled by @xcite and dust - obscured lgrbs assembled by @xcite , after rejecting several datasets that showed evidence of residual lgrb light . in many cases ,",
    "_ hst _ images were acquired at least a year after the explosion ; these are the data we use when available to measure galaxy sizes .",
    "when only images taken closer to the time of the grb are available , we inspect the host galaxy to determine whether evidence for a point source at the explosion site exists . lgrbs exhibit a strong association with the brightest pixels of their hosts @xcite ,",
    "so a potential concern is that we could reject data where the lgrb coincided with a bright star - forming region . in practice ,",
    "possible confusion was minimal for the data taken within @xmath31 months after the grb trigger . while we do not expect any significant contamination , here we are interested in the integrated properties of the host galaxy and not the specific region where the lgrb occurred .",
    "even when an optical afterglow can be detected , identifying a coincident sn in the fading afterglow light curve , or by identifying a sn spectrum superimposed on the power - law afterglow continuum , requires high signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) data .",

    "our grb sample includes events with and without a detected optical afterglow or coincident sn .",

    "for both the @xmath1 core - collapse sn and @xmath2 lgrb samples , as well as the sdss star - forming population , we estimate host - galaxy stellar masses @xmath36 and photometric star - formation rates ( sfrs ) by fitting pegase2 @xcite stellar population synthesis models to broadband photometry ; see @xcite for detailed information on the star - formation histories and initial - mass functions ( imfs ) used . for nearby core - collapse sn host galaxies and the sdss star - forming population , we fit sloan @xmath15 magnitudes .",
    "the multi - band photometry of the host galaxies of lgrbs was assembled from the ghosts database .",
    "we describe a second , complementary set of sfr estimates in the following section that is available only for the sdss star - forming spectroscopic sample and which uses both the fiber spectrum and broadband @xmath15 photometry .",
    "when comparing among samples , however , we only compare sfr values estimated using the same method .",
    "several teams have performed and made available detailed measurements of sdss galaxy properties from the sloan photometry and spectroscopy . for the @xmath28 samples of core - collapse sn host galaxies and the sdss star - forming population , we use sfrs estimated from fitting both spectra and photometry , and gas velocity dispersions @xmath37 measured from the h@xmath33 emission - line profile .",
    "we use the star - forming classifications for sdss galaxies and hybrid spectroscopic and photometric sfr estimates made available by a collaboration that was both at the max planck institute for astronomy ( mpa ) and johns hopkins university ( jhu ) ( s. charlot , g. kauffmann , s. white , t. heckman , c. tremonti , and j. brinchmann ; mpa - jhu ) .",
    "sdss fiber apertures generally do not cover the entire light distribution of each target galaxy .",
    "the mpa - jhu team therefore estimates the total sfr of each galaxy as the sum of the sfr within the fiber aperture determined from fitting the spectrum , and from a fit to the @xmath15 light outside the fiber opening .",
    "we adopt the gas velocity dispersions estimated from sdss emission - line profiles by the portsmouth group @xcite , which apply the public penalized pixel fitting @xcite ( ppxf ) and the gas and absorption line fitting @xcite ( gandalf v1.5 ) codes .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the gas is estimated from the widths of emission lines ( e.g. , h@xmath33 , [ o@xmath38iii ] ) , and here we take the dispersion for h@xmath33 .",
    "the sdss photo pipeline performs separate fits of a de vaucouleurs @xmath39 law and an exponential profile to the light distribution of each extended object .",
    "the pipeline next finds the linear combination of the two models ( holding all parameters except flux fixed ) that minimizes the @xmath40 statistic . to obtain an estimate of the half - light radius @xmath41 , we compute the weighted average of the two components @xmath41 parameters and weight each by its fractional contribution to the total model flux .",
    "we use the galfit @xcite program to perform the same surface - brightness fitting analysis on archival _ hst _ images of lgrb host galaxies .",
    "we apply source extractor ( sextractor ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to drizzled and cosmic - ray - rejected images to estimate object positions , ellipticities , and magnitudes , and these are used as input galfit parameters . extended sources except the lgrb hosts are modeled with sersic profiles , and the instrument point - spread function ( psf ) is used to model stars .",
    "the host - galaxy @xmath41 estimates show good agreement with existing estimates of @xmath41 from profile fitting @xcite , and with published @xmath42 sextractor measurements @xcite .",
    "the host galaxy of grb 020903 is part of a complex association of interacting clumps , so the galaxy is not well approximated by a simple surface - brightness model .",
    "an additional complication is that much of the host - galaxy photometry was taken from the ground , where the galaxy components can not be resolved .",
    "we therefore have excluded this host galaxy from the analysis .",
    "the angular diameter of eso184-g82 , the host galaxy of the nearby grb 980425 ( @xmath43 ) , approximately spans the available _ hst _ images .",
    "the physical resolution of the _ hst _ data is also substantially higher than that of the images of the sdss sn host galaxies , or other lgrb hosts . measurement of the host effective radius from model fitting requires significant imaging area without galaxy light to be able to fit robustly for the background level .",
    "we therefore do not include grb 980425 , which does not have sdss exposures , in the lgrb sample .",
    "the host galaxy of grb 051022 is also a system with two peaks that may possibly correspond to two strongly interacting galaxies , or else may instead be a galaxy with irregular morphology .",
    "we expect that the sdss photo pipeline would be most likely to model the host as a single system , so we construct a galfit model that consists of a single galaxy .",
    "we calculate the projected stellar - mass density @xmath44 and the projected star - formation density @xmath45 from the galaxy stellar mass @xmath36 and star - formation rate sfr , respectively , and the parameters of the model @xmath16-band isophotal ellipse that encloses half of the galaxy light .",
    "we compute , for example , @xmath46 , where @xmath36 is the stellar mass ( in @xmath47 ) , while @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the semimajor and semiminor axes ( in kpc ) of the isophotal ellipse that contains half of the galaxy @xmath16-band flux , determined from fitting its surface - brightness distribution .",
    "photometric magnitudes measured through an appropriate aperture designed to enclose a specific percentage of the host light ( e.g. , a petrosian aperture ; @xcite ) can be expected to sample an approximately consistent fraction of galaxy light with increasing distance to sources .",

    ", we exclude the host galaxy itself when fitting the predictive model to the properties of sdss galaxies .",
    "this approach assigns greater weight to galaxies with similar observables , and mitigates any possible selection effect with galaxy redshift or fiber fraction .",

    "in figures  [ fig : massmassdensity ] and  [ fig : masssfrdensity ] , we plot galaxy stellar - mass density @xmath44 and star - formation density @xmath45 , estimated from broadband magnitudes , against stellar mass @xmath36 . these show that @xmath1 sn  ic - bl and @xmath14  lgrb host galaxies have high stellar - mass density and star - formation density for their stellar masses , compared with the low - redshift ( @xmath1 ) sdss star - forming galaxy population .",
    "in contrast , sn  ib / ic ( with slower ejecta speeds ) and sn  ii show no preference for galaxies that have high stellar - mass density or high star - formation density for their stellar masses .",
    "we compute the residuals of each host galaxy from the sdss @xmath36@xmath44 and @xmath36@xmath45 relations .",
    "our statistical method is to determine the probability that each pair of residual distributions is identical using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) two - sample test .",

    "the galaxy @xmath36@xmath44 relation shows no significant change with increasing redshift to @xmath69 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , so comparisons involving the lgrb host @xmath36@xmath44 relation should not be strongly affected by evolution in the galaxy population with redshift .",
    "we study the @xmath1 sdss star - forming population to investigate whether galaxies with relatively high stellar - mass and star - formation densities have comparatively low chemical abundances . in figure",
    "[ fig : sdsspop ] , we show the average @xcite oxygen abundance of @xmath1 sdss star - forming galaxies as a function of @xmath36 and @xmath44 as well as @xmath45 .",

    "the galaxies with the highest stellar - mass densities are , on average , more metal - rich by @xmath40.2 dex .",
    "an important question is whether the high stellar - mass and star - formation - rate densities of sn  ic - bl and @xmath14 lgrb host galaxies can be attributed entirely to the preference for low metal abundance observed among low - redshift sn  ic - bl @xcite and lgrbs @xcite .",
    "we can represent such a preference as a progenitor formation efficiency @xmath70 per unit stellar mass created that depends solely on metallicity @xmath71 and diminishes with increasing @xmath71 .",

    "a transient population whose @xmath70 has no environmental dependence would be expected to explode equally in galaxies above and below these sfr - weighted relations .",
    "if @xmath70 instead increases at low abundance ( and depends only on @xmath71 ) , we would expect greater numbers of sn ic - bl and @xmath14 lgrbs on the side of the relation , either above or below , that is comparatively metal poor .    inspection of figure  [ fig : sdsspop ] shows that , on average , higher stellar - mass density corresponds to higher metallicity , while metallicity does not vary strongly with star - formation density among galaxies in each bin in stellar mass .",
    "consequently , if @xmath70 increases at low abundance ( and depends only on @xmath71 ) , we would expect a plurality of sn ic - bl and @xmath14 lgrbs to be below the sfr - weighted @xmath73 relation , and approximately equal numbers above and below the sfr - weighted @xmath74 relation .",
    "since this prediction is very different from the pattern we observe , the production of sn ic - bl and lgrb progenitors much be enhanced by an additional factor other than low metallicity that varies with @xmath44 as well as @xmath45 .",
    "high gas dispersion velocities provide additional , independent evidence for distinct physical conditions in the host galaxies of low - redshift sn  ic - bl . in figure",
    "[ fig : halphaveldisp ] , the sn  ic - bl hosts describe an @xmath36@xmath37 relation with an offset to high gas velocity dispersion measured from the h@xmath33 emission lines in the sdss fiber spectra .",
    "the sn  ic - bl host distribution is significantly different from the sn  ib / ic ( ) and the sn  ii ( ) host distributions .",
    "the comparatively high gas velocity dispersions of sn  ic - bl host galaxies may have one or more physical explanations .",
    "rotationally supported galaxies having more compact and dense mass configurations are expected to have higher velocity dispersions .",
    "alternatively , recent analysis of the gas kinematics of a sample of @xmath750.3 compact , highly star - forming galaxies finds complex profiles for the strong emission lines , with several narrow ( @xmath76120kms@xmath5 ) and broad ( @xmath77250kms@xmath5 ) components @xcite that may be due to strong stellar winds , or emission from expanding sn remnants .    in figures  [ fig : icblmosaic ] and",

    "these sfr measurements may be expected to be more accurate and precise than the sfr estimates that are based on galaxy broadband photometry alone , and provide evidence that the preference among sn  ic - bl and lgrbs for high @xmath45 seen in figure  [ fig : masssfrdensity ] galaxies is robust .",

    "this shows that host galaxies of sn  ic - bl are not substantially more strongly star forming for their stellar masses than other core - collapse hosts , and suggests that relatively compact host sizes may primarily account for their high star - formation - rate densities .",
    "given the existing evidence that @xmath10 sn  ic - bl @xcite and lgrbs @xcite prefer metal - poor environments , a reasonable question is whether the high @xmath44 and @xmath45 host galaxies in our sample having sdss spectra describe a metal - poor mass - metallicity ( @xmath36@xmath71 ) relation .",

    "core - collapse sn with more slowly expanding ejecta , however , exhibit no preference for galaxies having overdense stellar - mass distributions and star formation .",
    "sn  ic - bl host galaxies exhibit high gas velocity dispersions for their stellar masses , providing evidence for exceptional conditions in their hosts .    given the effect of stellar metallicity to strengthen line - driven winds and remove the angular momentum of massive stars , studies of sn and lgrb host galaxies have often attempted to explain environmental patterns in terms of chemical abundance .",
    "however , across the stellar - mass range populated by sn  ic - bl and lgrb hosts , sdss star - forming galaxies with high stellar - mass and star - formation - rate densities are not , on average , more metal poor than less dense galaxies having similar stellar masses ( see figure  [ fig : sdsspop ] ) .",
    "therefore , a preference other than for low metallicity environments must be responsible for the overrepresentation of sn and lgrbs in galaxies with high stellar - mass and star - formation - rate densities .",
    "furthermore , the @xmath36@xmath71 relation of sn  ic - bl host galaxies , which have high stellar - mass and star - formation densities , is not significantly metal poor compared to the sdss @xmath36@xmath71 relation ( kelly et al .",
    "2014 , in prep . ) .",
    "in fact , a preference of high - velocity explosions for rapidly star - forming or overdense regions may help explain the observed association of lgrbs with the brightest regions of their host galaxies @xcite .",
    "an initial suggestion was that a strong association with the brightest regions would be expected for lgrbs if they occur preferentially in low - mass , metal - poor galaxies .",
    "if the most massive stars form in ob associations , then these will be more likely to correspond to the peaks of the light distribution of low - mass , metal - poor galaxies .",
    "ob associations in more massive , metal - rich spirals may instead be outranked in brightness by , for example , the nucleus .",
    "while such a low - metallicity preference may contribute , we suggest that an affinity to high star - formation density is important .",
    "a plausible explanation for the association of lgrbs with regions of higher star - formation density is the formation efficiency of young , bound star clusters .",
    "observations of extragalactic star clusters have found evidence that bound - cluster formation efficiency increases with the star - formation density @xcite .",
    "binary systems may be created more frequently in bound clusters , and those that form are expected to become progressively tighter through dynamical interactions with other members of the cluster @xcite .",
    "therefore , massive stars that form in dense star clusters are more likely to be in tight binary systems . interacting massive binaries are candidate progenitor systems for sn  ic - bl and lgrbs , because mass transfer or common - envelope evolution leading ( in some cases ) to a merger can yield a rapidly rotating star whose outer envelope is not composed of h.",
    "if sn  ic - bl and lgrbs explode from stars that are more massive than the progenitors of sn  ib / ic and sn  ii , an imf that becomes top - heavy in dense , highly star - forming regions provides an alternative explanation for the patterns we observe .",
    "indirect evidence from the absorption features of @xmath80 stars suggests instead that the imf may be bottom - heavy in elliptical galaxies with high stellar velocity dispersions and [ mg / fe ] , which are thought to have had high star formation densities during their formation epoch @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the imf may be bottom heavy in dense , highly star - forming regions , while the opposite trend would be required to explain our observations .",
    "an improved census of massive stars across low - redshift environments may help to address more directly whether the patterns we have found can be explained by variation in the upper end of the imf .",
    "the median redshift ( @xmath81 ) of the @xmath14 lgrb sample is substantially higher than those of the core - collapse sn sample ( @xmath82 ) and the sdss sample of galaxy spectra ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "the and relations among star - forming galaxies may evolve toward lower @xmath44 and @xmath45 densities from @xmath84  to the low - redshift universe . as we have shown , however , the low - redshift sn  ic - bl host galaxy population exhibits the same preference for high stellar - mass and star - formation density galaxies as lgrbs . additionally ,",
    "if stellar - mass and star - formation - rate density are proxies for the star - forming conditions that promote the formation of sn  ic - bl progenitors , then we expect that these same physical conditions exist in high - redshift lgrb host galaxies having similar positions in the and planes .",
    "given the evidence that the progenitors of high - velocity ejecta core - collapse explosions form more efficiently in galaxies that have high stellar - mass and star - formation densities , a reasonable expectation is that lgrbs will be improved tracers of star formation at earlier epochs where galaxies have higher densities of stellar mass and ongoing star formation than in the low - redshift universe @xcite .",
    "lgrbs may be the most powerful probes of star formation at the highest redshifts .",
    "the extreme luminosities of lgrbs allow detection at the earliest epochs of star formation ( @xmath85 ) , where optical and infrared instruments are not yet able to detect sub-@xmath86 galaxies .",
    "the evidence we have found that the formation of lgrb progenitors depends sensitively on star - forming conditions suggests that they will be critical tools for investigating early star formation in detail .",
    "we have studied the host galaxies of a sample of 245 low - redshift core - collapse sn , including 17 sn  ic - bl discovered by galaxy - untargeted searches and 15 optically luminous and dust - obscured @xmath2 lgrbs .",
    "we have used the uniform fiber spectra and photometry of the sdss to measure the properties of the core - collapse sn host - galaxy sample , as well as characterize the low - redshift star - forming galaxy population . published multi - band photometry as well as _",
    "hst _ imaging were used to study the @xmath14 lgrb host galaxies .",
    "the outflowing ejecta of sn ic - bl , from the wide features of their spectra , and of lgrbs , through their association with sn ic - bl and @xmath7-ray emission , are inferred to expand with high velocities ( @xmath420,00030,000kms@xmath5 ) .",
    "we have found that these core - collapse explosions in which a significant fraction of the ejecta is moving at high velocity prefer galaxies with high stellar - mass and star - formation densities , when compared to galaxies having similar stellar masses .",
    "the core - collapse sn in our sample having typical velocities of their ejecta , in contrast , are found approximately equally in galaxies with comparatively low and high stellar - mass and star - formation densities . from the widths of h@xmath33 emission lines , we find that the hosts of sn  ic - bl have exceptionally high gas velocity dispersions when compared with star - forming galaxies having similar stellar masses .    while early lgrb host environment analyses helped to establish the connection between lgrbs and massive stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) , subsequent analysis has focused on the effect of metal abundance on the creation of their progenitors ( e.g. , @xcite ) , or sought to explain environmental patterns in terms of a preference for metal - poor galaxies ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "here we have shown that the preference of low - redshift sn  ic - bl and @xmath14 lgrbs for galaxies with high stellar - mass and star - formation - rate densities , compared to star - forming galaxies of similar stellar mass , is separate from a preference for low metal abundances .",
    "observations of extragalactic star formation have suggested that dense stellar clusters may form with greater efficiency in regions of dense star formation @xcite .",
    "a prospective explanation for the host - galaxy patterns we find is the efficient formation of tight massive binary progenitor systems in such densely star - forming environments . alternatively ,",
    "if sn ic - bl and lgrb progenitors have greater stellar masses than those of core - collapse sn with typical ejecta velocities , a top - heavy imf in galaxies with high stellar - mass density and star - formation density could account for these same patterns .",
    "however , such a top - heavy imf would need to be reconciled with evidence instead for a bottom - heavy imf in massive galaxies that were densely star forming while assembling their mass @xcite .",
    "the construction of ground - based telescopes with large aperture ( e.g. , the thirty meter telescope ; giant magellan telescope ) and the james webb space telescope will make possible observations of galaxies formed shortly after reionization , but the faintest galaxies will remain beyond their sensitivity .",
