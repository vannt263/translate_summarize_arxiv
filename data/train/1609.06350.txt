    "the solution , discovered by feynman  @xcite , faddeev and popov  @xcite , is to add two anticommuting directions @xmath13 and use an euclidean metric in @xmath14 space and anti - symmetric symplectic metric in @xmath13 space : @xmath15 , effectively replacing @xmath7 by @xmath16 .",

    "their ghost spectra are given by the corresponding tensors of @xmath20 .",
    "in the early days of lie superalgebra representations , the @xmath21 correspondence was generalized to other classes of representations  @xcite . for finite - dimensional tensors of @xmath0",
