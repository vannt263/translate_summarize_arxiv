    "@xmath0for short polypeptides the finishing stage of the degradation is relatively important , while in this stage the translocation rate is affected by the edge effects ( the backward end of the polypeptide gets inside the proteasome chamber ) and is not the same as for the remainder of the polypeptide .",

    "for such a sequence a test like the one in ( but with much stronger dithering : @xmath108 ) is presented in . due to the small number of unknown parameters the reconstruction procedure is rather tolerant to measurement inaccuracy and",
