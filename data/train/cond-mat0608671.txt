    "the drastic slowing down of a system s dynamics as the temperature @xmath0 is lowered towards a critical temperature @xmath1 is a well - known feature of many physical systems .",
    "typical examples include the slowing down of the @xmath2-relaxation process in supercooled liquids as the glass transition temperature is approached and the critical slowing down of the dynamical processes in a system undergoing a phase transition as the phase transition temperature is approached .",
    "there are two aspects of this slowing down , namely the general theory and the nature of the specific mechanism . for the general theory , in the case of phase transitions this slowing down",
    "can readily be derived quite simply from the landau theory of phase transitions , which involves an expression for the free energy of the system in terms of an order parameter and its fluctuations.@xcite , while for the glass transition there are various suggestions for general theories but none that is yet generally accepted @xcite . with regard to the nature of the specific mechanism , it is usually assumed that this slowing down is associated with a drastic slowing down in the rates at which the particles make transitions . in this paper , we show that there is another possible mechanism , namely a change in the results of successive transitions , and present results for a specific model system where this is the case .",
    "the calculation of a system s properties is usually performed in terms of correlation functions @xmath3 , that describe the average relationship between the states of the particles at time @xmath4 with their original state at time @xmath5 .",
    "one reason for this is that , according to kubo s formula , many of a system s observable macroscopic properties are determined by correlation functions .",
    "for instance , the frequency dependent dielectric susceptibility @xmath6 is proportional to the fourier transform of the dipole - dipole correlation function @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "hence , a rapid increase in the probability that molecules return to their original state ( in the relevant phase space ) following a transition , which we call the return probability , will also lead to a drastic slowing down in the rate of decay of the correlation functions , and so of the associated relaxation processes and of the system s dynamics .",
    "the question of whether this process , rather than a drastic slowing down of the transition rates , is responsible for the slow dynamics is well worth investigating .",
    "for instance , for supercooled liquids it has important implications for the type of theory that can explain the glass transition , as we discuss below .",
    "incidentally , this type of approach is in line with that of berthier and garrahan berthier , who emphasized the importance of considering transitions in real space .",
    "the property of a system that is most often studied , both theoretically and experimentally , is the correlation function , but this on its own can not show which of the above mechanisms is responsible for the slowing down .",
    "another property that can readily be studied theoretically ( although not so easily measured experimentally ) , and which can throw some light on this question , is the fraction of particles in the system that have never changed their state up to time @xmath4 .",
    "we call this function the system s transition function and denote it by @xmath8 . if the particles move randomly after making a transition , the correlation and transition functions should decay with time in a very similar manner . however , if the particles have a tendency to return to their original state because of the arrangement of their neighbors , as in funke s mismatch and relaxation model for  ionic conductors @xcite and in the cage effect in mode coupling theory @xcitefor instance , the correlation function will decay much more slowly with time than the transition function .",
    "it follows that a comparison of the change in the time dependence of these functions as the critical temperature is approached can throw light on which of the above mechanisms is responsible for the slow dynamics . in this paper",
    ", we make such a comparison for a simple model system in which there is a phase transition , and so critical slowing down as it is approached , and then consider the implications of our results for other systems .",
    "the system that we consider is the ferromagnetic @xmath9-state potts model , for which we have recently reported results for the transition function @xmath8 , in a paper @xcite henceforth referred to as i. the function @xmath10 was there called @xmath11 and termed the relaxation function , but we have changed its name and symbol in this paper so as to avoid any impression that it is related to a physical property such as the dielectric polarization .",
    "we have extended the calculations in i by calculating simultaneously the transition function @xmath8 and the normalized correlation function @xmath12 , which we define below , as @xmath13 increases towards unity . in section 2 , we describe briefly the model system and how we analyzed its properties .",
    "the results of our calculations are presented and discussed in section 3 , while our conclusions are summarized in section 4 .",
    "the hamiltonian for the ordered ferromagnetic @xmath9-spin potts model with interactions only between the spins at adjacent sites can be written as wu - rev @xmath14where @xmath15 the first sum is over all the sites @xmath16 in the system and the second one over all the sites @xmath17  that are nearest neighbors of the site @xmath16 , the spins @xmath18 can take any integer value between @xmath19 and @xmath9 , and @xmath20 is the kronecker delta , @xmath21 if @xmath22 if @xmath23 . for this system",
    ", some care is needed in defining the relevant correlation function .",
    "the elementary correlation function is just @xmath24>$ ] , but this will never tend to zero as @xmath25 since the spins can only assume @xmath9 distinct values , so that even for completely random @xmath26 a fraction @xmath27 of them will equal @xmath28 . accordingly , for a system of @xmath29 spins we define the normalized correlation function @xmath12 by @xmath30 - 1/q\\}>/[n(1 - 1/q)]\\]]for which @xmath31 and if eventually there is no correlation between the initial and final states then @xmath32 .",
    "it follows from equation ( 1 ) that the energy @xmath33 associated with a site on which the spin is equal to that on @xmath34 adjacent sites is just @xmath35 .",
    "the probability of a change in the spin at a site which involves an increase of @xmath36 in this energy at temperature @xmath0 was taken to have the standard form @xmath37for an infinite square lattice , the values of the critical temperature @xmath38 are given by the solutions @xmath39 of the equation @xmath40 , where @xmath41)-1 $ ] , while the phase transition is of second order for @xmath42 and of first order for @xmath43 @xcite .  in order to examine both types of phase transition",
    ", we performed our calculations for two systems , with values of @xmath44 . for our simulations we considered , as in i , a square lattice of 200 x 200 sites , and we here chose @xmath45 since we are interested in temperatures close to @xmath1 .",
    "the simulation techniques used were the same as in i , apart from starting the anneals from an initial state of all identical spins instead of one with random spins . once a steady state",
    "was reached , five sets of several successive simulation runs were performed on the system , with each run proceeding until the spin had changed at least once at 99.9% of the sites . a maximum of 5 runs was performed in each set , but these were stopped once @xmath12 became less than @xmath46 .",
    "finally , the average values of @xmath8 and @xmath12 for the five sets of runs were calculated .",
    "the results were analyzed in terms of the mean relaxation times , @xmath47 , for the decay of these functions , and two different techniques were used to calculate them . in general , a monotonically decreasing function @xmath48 can be expressed as a sum or integral of functions @xmath49 , with a distribution @xmath50 of relaxation times @xmath51 , @xmath52 . in that case ,",
    "@xmath53 , and this latter expression was used to calculate @xmath47 .",
    "the main method that we used for our calculations was to fit @xmath10 and @xmath12 , for values of these functions greater than 0.01 , to stretched exponential functions @xmath54 $ ] , for which @xmath55 . in all cases ,",
    "an excellent fit was obtained ( in a graph of @xmath56 $ ] as a function of @xmath4 ) with @xmath57 .",
    "we restricted our calculations to values of @xmath58 such that after a set of 5 runs @xmath59 , since for higher final values of @xmath12 it is difficult to justify a fit to such a function .",
    "in addition , @xmath47 was calculated directly for the two functions from @xmath60 , and the value obtained was found to be very close to that obtained from the fit to the stretched exponential function ( except for @xmath12 at the highest values of @xmath61 , where the cut - off in @xmath12 after five runs led to a much lower value for @xmath62 since the integral did not extend to negligible values of @xmath12 ) .",
    "accordingly , all  the results for @xmath47 that we present , which are denoted by @xmath63 for @xmath10 and by @xmath64 for @xmath12 ,  are those derived from fits to a stretched exponential function .",
    "in figure 1 , we show both @xmath65 and @xmath66 as functions of @xmath13 for @xmath67 and for @xmath68 . incidentally , the results presented here for @xmath65 differ slightly from those in our previous paper i because there we showed the stretched exponential relaxation time @xmath69 rather than @xmath47 , and also used @xmath70 .",
    "it is immediately apparent that while for @xmath71 the relaxation times @xmath64 and @xmath63 are similar , the relaxation times @xmath72 for the correlation function becomes larger than those for the transition function @xmath63 as @xmath13 increases , until for @xmath73 we find that @xmath74 @xmath75 for @xmath67 and @xmath76 for @xmath68 .  in order to show the difference between the functions @xmath12 and @xmath8 , and not just the ratio of their relaxation times , we present these functions for @xmath71 and @xmath77 for @xmath67 in figure 2 and for @xmath68 in figure 3 .",
    "these figures show clearly that for @xmath78 the transition and correlation functions decay with time in a very similar manner , but for @xmath77 the correlation function decays much more slowly than the transition function .",
    "we also note from figure 1 that as @xmath79 while @xmath65 increases fairly steadily , with no particular sign of a phase transition , @xmath66 starts to increase very rapidly , so that for higher values of @xmath13 than those shown in the figure it decays very little on the time scale of around @xmath80 to which we extended our simulations . thus , it is the rapid increase in @xmath64 ( rather than in @xmath63 ) which is a sign of the critical slowing down associated with a phase transition in our system , and this is due to the rapid increase in the return probability .    for the potts model",
    ", there is a simple qualitative explanation of this increase in the return probability as the temperature decreases , and also of the difference between the systems with @xmath67 and those with @xmath68 .",
    "for a site within a cluster of identical spins on a square lattice , the activation energy @xmath81 required for a transition is @xmath82 . as a result ,",
    "the slowing down of the decay of the transition function , which is associated with the temperature dependence of the factor @xmath83  in equation ( 3 ) and with the increasing fraction of sites within clusters ( as found in i ) as @xmath0 decreases , does not change dramatically as @xmath0 approches @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "when the spin at a site within a cluster changes , it can change again without any activation energy until it returns to its original state , when it again requires an activation energy of @xmath82 to change it .",
    "thus , the spins on sites within clusters have a strong tendency to return to their original values unless the spins on the adjacent states have changed before they do so , something that happens most easily at higher temperatures , and also for small clusters since the spins at sites on the boundary of a cluster require a lower activation energy to change . as a result",
    ", the increase in the fraction of sites within clusters ( and in the mean cluster size ) as @xmath0 decreases leads to a rapid increase in the return probability , and so in the ratio of @xmath74 , with a dramatic increase as the transition to a single phase is approached .",
    "this is just an example of critical slowing down as the phase transition is approached .",
    "it sets in at lower temperatures ( higher values of @xmath13 ) for @xmath68 than for @xmath67 because the fraction of sites within clusters at a given value of @xmath85 decreases with increasing number of different possible values of the spins , i.e. with increasing @xmath9 , as was found in figure 8 of i.    the above results show that for the ferromagnetic potts model the main mechanism responsible for the critical slowing down as the phase transition is approached is the increasing return probability and not a drastic slowing down in the rate at which transitions occur .",
    "such a mechanism is not restricted to the potts model , and not necessarily even to phase transitions , and can well be relevant to the glass transition in supercooled liquids .",
    "as we discussed in i , the potts model can be regarded as a simple model for plastic crystals , which have relaxation properties similar to those of supercooled liquids @xcite .",
    "accordingly , we now consider the relevance of this type of process to the  drastic slowing down of the relaxation rates in supercooled liquids as the glass transition is approached .",
    "our results show that this need not be caused by a change in the basic relaxation mechanism , and in fact",
    "no such change was found in recent experiments by huang and richert @xcite . instead , as for the potts model , it can be due to the local molecular arrangements being such that even when a molecule instantaneously changes its position or orientation it rapidly returns to its original lower energy state .",
    "such a process is obviously compatible with theories of the glass transition based on heterogeneities @xcite and/or smeared out phase transitions glass - phasetrans , since the potts model exhibits a phase transition while the clusters of states of identical spin in it are local heterogeneities .",
    "it is also fully compatible with theories of the glass transition that involve potential energy landscapes @xcite , for which the molecular transitions correspond to jumps within a meta - basin and those which lead to diffusion of the molecule ( and so to decay of the correlation function ) to jumps of the system from one meta - basin to another .",
    "however , such a process does not fit so well to theories based on free volume  @xcite  or on kinetic constraints @xcite , where it is the basic transition rates of the molecules that change drastically as the temperature is lowered .",
    "of course , it is quite possible that different mechanisms are the dominant ones in different systems .",
    "a comparison between the transition function @xmath8 and the correlation function @xmath12 of a system that exhibits a drastic slowing down of its dynamical properties can show whether this slow dynamics is caused mainly by a slowing down in the transition rates of the particles or by an increase in their tendency to return to their original state following such a transition .",
    "for the ferromagnetic potts model , the latter process was found to be responsible for the critical slowing down as the phase transition was approached .",
    "the question of which is the dominant process has important consequences for the different theories of the glass transition in various types of supercooled liquids .",
