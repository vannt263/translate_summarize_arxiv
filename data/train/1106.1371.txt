    "quantum _ systems could not desynchronize again , simply by reversing the arrow of time .",
    "it is suggested that decoherence , i. e. the interaction of a system with its environment , as it breaks time reversal symmetry , is an essential ingredient in order to study quantum synchronization @xcite .",

    "while these authors use path integral methods to derive the reduced density matrix @xcite , in the present work we will apply the born - markov approximation , which not only reproduces the results of @xcite but also gives more general results and is less complicated from a mathematical point of view . in the present paper , we will derive and solve the born - markov equation of @xmath0 linearly coupled harmonic oscillators , each one interacting with its own bosonic heat bath , and point out the formal analogy with the problem of a single oscillator in a heat bath ( section [ s2 ] ) .",

    "the authors of @xcite remark , the caldeira - leggett limit with only position - position coupling is trivial : it generates no new non - unitary contributions .",
    "it is interesting that the master equation ( 38 ) in @xcite with ( bilinear ) position - momentum and momentum - momentum couplings is very similar to our master equation ( of course the terms in @xmath81 are absent , as they vanish in the high temperature limit ) .",
    "note that there is no problem to introduce position - momentum and momentum - momentum couplings in our model as well , this would merely change the matrix @xmath55 . as long as the born - markov approximation holds ,",

    "therefore , the `` off - diagonal '' coefficients @xmath98 account for the decoherence of the oscillator @xmath7 caused by the coupling to the oscillator @xmath96 .",
    "a similar interpretation can be attributed to the anomalous diffusion coefficients @xmath81 .",
    "in contrast to the exact master equation , the born - markov equation can be solved easily . to do this , it is useful to change to a more suitable basis via the transformation @xcite @xmath103 where @xmath104 , @xmath105 .",
    "physically , the coordinate @xmath106 measures the distance from the diagonal @xmath107 in position basis , while @xmath108 can be associated with the position _ on _ the diagonal .",
    "note also the formal similarity to the weyl transform @xcite . by applying on one obtains the following first order linear partial differential equation : @xmath109\\rho(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{\\delta},t ) \\end{split}\\ ] ] equation can be solved using the method of characteristics . on a characteristic line @xmath110",

    "+ it is interesting from a mathematical point of view that the solution factorizes into a part depending on the initial condition and a gaussian part describing decoherence and therefore independent of the initial condition ( a similar result was found for quantum brownian motion in @xcite ) .",
    "it is also surprising that the same matrix @xmath128 that describes the evolution of the expectation values @xmath129 and @xmath130 enters in the part of the solution depending on the initial condition .",
    "if one compares with the solution of the single oscillator problem , one finds that the two solutions are formally equivalent .",

    "an excess of energy is transferred from oscillator 1 to oscillator 2 .",
    "this unexpected mechanism leads to the effective dissipation of _ both _ oscillators and is only possible because the oscillators are coupled to the _ same _ reservoir .",

    "this can be done analytically by using standard methods , but the resulting expressions are lengthy . we have therefore refrained from stating them explicitly . instead of the above exponential cut - off we will use a lorentz cut - off function as in , which has the advantage that there exist closed expressions also for @xmath93 and @xmath81 ( only for the case @xmath237 ) @xcite and not only for @xmath95 and @xmath98 .",
    "note that the results of subsection 4.1 for @xmath165 can also be obtained by using the spectral density .",
    "the choice of the cut - off function is therefore physically irrelevant . if one plots the solutions of , one obtains the classically expected result : two coupled damped oscillations ( figure [ cla ] ) . in this example , due to the coupling , the oscillator with the lower frequency will follow the motion of the oscillator with the higher frequency .",
    "figure [ cla ] shows that the evolution of the mean position is not the same for distinct and common reservoirs , e. g. the low frequency oscillation takes longer to follow the high frequency oscillation in the case of a common reservoir .",

    "as already mentioned in section [ s3 ] , the case of vanishing coupling @xmath238 is particularly interesting : for distinct reservoirs , one obtains two independent damped oscillations , whereas in the case of a common reservoir a reservoir - induced interaction couples the two oscillations ( figure [ cla ] ) . before concluding this section",
    ", it has to be said that alone , with arbitrary coefficients @xmath93 and @xmath95 , also admits a bunch of unphysical solutions ( e. g. exponentially increasing oscillations ) . only a physically reasonable spectral density , which enters in the quantum mechanical calculation of @xmath93 and @xmath95 , ensures physical solutions ( for the calculation of the spectral density from microscopic models see @xcite ) .    , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 ) .",

    ", we calculate the quantum mechanical uncertainties @xmath247 from the reduced density matrix for two initial gaussian wave packets , described by the density matrix @xmath248 as in the case of one harmonic oscillator @xcite , the uncertainties saturate after some time .",
    "but unlike the expectation values @xmath249 , which end in the same final state of vanishing amplitude , no matter how strong the interaction between the oscillators is , the uncertainties reach different values for @xmath250 , depending on the interaction strength ( figure [ dx ] , these values do not depend on the initial conditions ) .",
    "this means that _ quantum mechanically _ an effect of the interaction remains even at @xmath250 . in figure [ dx ]",
    ", one also sees that for low temperatures the uncertainties obtained by the caldeira - leggett approximation differ considerably from those calculated by using the born - markov approximation , especially for large times .",
    "it is also worth noting that for the studied temperature @xmath237 the caldeira - leggett uncertainties systematically underestimate the born - markov uncertainties and relax more rapidly into their final values .    , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , @xmath239 , @xmath240 , @xmath241 ) .",
    "the initial uncertainties are chosen to be @xmath253 .",

    "the saturation values are not the same for uncoupled ( black ) and coupled ( red , @xmath256 ) oscillators . for small times",
    "@xmath257 the uncertainties calculated by using the caldeira - leggett approximation ( green , @xmath256 , see ) differ not much from those calculated with the help of the born - markov approximation . for larger times",
    "the differences are considerable.,width=226 ]",
    "in the present paper we worked out how to calculate the density matrix for a system of linearly coupled oscillators in a bosonic heat bath using the born - markov approximation . by having done this , we complemented previous results from @xcite , which are only valid in the caldeira - leggett limit . as long as the born - markov approximation holds",
    ", we are now able to access the non - ohmic , low temperature regime . in the case of the two - oscillator system we found that the expectation values of position reproduce the classically expected result of coupled damped oscillations with certain renormalized coefficients . as for the quantum uncertainties ,",
    "they are modified by the coupling even in the limit @xmath250 .",
    "moreover , we have explictly seen that the coupling to a common reservoir leads to reservoir - induced interactions . in this context , using a specific spectral density , we found an interesting dissipation mechanism for a common reservoir , which is based on the fact that energy can be tranferred via the heat bath .",
    "this mechanism is due to the influence of the high frequency modes of the environment on the coupled system and is therefore not observable in the caldeira - leggett limit .",
    "the above results should encourage further studies in decoherence of interacting systems , in particular regarding the coupling to a common reservoir @xcite .",
    "we note that the presence of several reservoirs leads to interesting effects already for classical particles @xcite .",
    "the calculation of other interesting physical quantities , like the entanglement of the subsystems , is postponed to a later work .",
    "in addition , it would also be interesting to study the effects that occur in the strong coupling , non - markovian regime .",
