    "the article gives an approach to the exponential stability of equations of the form @xmath0 where we denote the derivative with respect to the temporal variable by @xmath1 .",
    "the ( unbounded ) linear operator @xmath2 , acting on some hilbert space , is assumed to be maximal monotone and we refer to the monographs @xcite for the topic of monotone operators on hilbert spaces .",
    "equation is completed by a constitutive relation of the form @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a bounded linear operator acting in time and space .",
    "thus , we end up with an equation of the form @xmath5 which we refer to as an _ evolutionary equation . _",
    "this class of problems was introduced by picard in @xcite , where @xmath2 was assumed to be skew - selfadjoint , and it was illustrated that many equations of classical mathematical physics are covered by this abstract class . the well - posedness for such problems is proved , by showing that the operator @xmath6 is boundedly invertible in a suitable hilbert space .",
    "more precisely , the derivative @xmath1 is established as a normal , continuously invertible operator in an exponentially weighted @xmath7-space and @xmath4 is defined as a function of @xmath8 ( see section 2 ) and the well - posedness is shown under a positive definiteness constraint on the operator @xmath4 ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* solution theory ) and of this article ) .",
    "moreover , the question of causality , which can be seen as a characterizing property for evolutionary processes , was addressed , which leads to additional constraints on the operator @xmath9 namely that @xmath4 is defined via the laplace - transform of an analytic and bounded function @xmath10 ( for more details see section 2 ) .",
    "especially the analyticity of @xmath11 is crucial for the causality , due to the correlation of supports of @xmath7-functions and the analyticity of their laplace - transforms by the paley - wiener theorem ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 19.2 ) ) . later on these results were generalized to the case of @xmath2 being a maximal monotone relation in @xcite .    in this work",
    "we give sufficient criteria in terms of the function @xmath11 , which yield the exponential stability of the evolutionary problem .",
    "the study of stability issues for differential equations , which goes back to lyapunov ( see @xcite for a survey ) , has become a very active field of research for many decades and there exist numerous works dealing with this topic .",
    "we just like to mention some standard approaches to exponential stability .",
    "the first strategy goes back to lyapunov .",
    "the aim is to find a suitable function ( a so - called lyapunov function ) yielding a certain differential inequality , which allows to derive statements about the asymptotic behavior of solutions of the differential equation .",
    "a second approach , which applies to linear differential equations , is based on the theory of semigroups . in this framework",
    "different criteria for exponential stability were derived in terms of the semigroup or its generator , e.g. datko s lemma ( @xcite or @xcite ) , gearharts theorem ( @xcite or @xcite ) or the spectral mapping theorem ( see ( * ? ? ? * , theorem 1.10 ) ) .",
    "a third approach uses the fourier- or the laplace - transform of a solution to derive statements of their asymptotics .",
    "these methods are sometimes referred to as frequency domain methods . in our framework",
    "it seems to be appropriate to employ the last approach , since , by the definition of @xmath4 , methods of vector - valued complex analysis are at hand through the laplace - transformation .",
    "note that , due to the general structure of evolutionary equations , the results apply to a broad class of differential equations , such as differential - algebraic equations , equations with memory effects or integro - differential equations , where semigroup methods may be difficult to apply .",
    "the article is structured as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the framework of evolutionary equations and its solution theory ( ) . section 3 provides an abstract condition for exponential stability for evolutionary equations in terms of the function @xmath11 and the proof of the main stability result ( ) . to illustrate the versatility of the previous results , we discuss several examples in section 4 .",
    "we begin to study differential - algebraic equations of mixed type and derive a condition for their exponential stability . moreover , we give a concrete example for such an equation , which seems hard to be tackled by other approaches , since the type of the differential equation switches on different parts of the underlying domain .",
    "furthermore , we give a possible approach how to deal with initial value problems .",
    "in subsection 4.2 we consider an example of a partial differential equation with memory effect .",
    "a similar problem was also treated by batkai and piazerra in @xcite , using a semigroup approach .",
    "in contrast to their result our approach directly extends to the case of differential - algebraic equations with delay .",
    "we conclude the article by discussing a parabolic integro - differential equation with an operator - valued kernel .",
    "we adopt the ideas of @xcite to derive the exponential stability .    throughout",
    "let @xmath12 be a complex hilbert space .",
    "we denote its inner product by @xmath13 which is assumed to be linear in the second and conjugate linear in the first argument .",
    "we denote its induced norm by @xmath14",
    "we recall some basic notions and results on linear evolutionary equations , i.e. equations of the form @xmath15    where @xmath16 is a linear , maximal monotone operator , @xmath17 denotes the time - derivative , established in a suitable hilbert space and @xmath18 is a bounded linear operator in time and space , a so - called _ linear material law .",
