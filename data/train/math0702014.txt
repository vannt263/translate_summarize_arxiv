    "eit is aimed at imaging the internal conductivity of a body from current and voltage measurements taken at the boundary .",
    "it is well known , @xcite , @xcite , that , even in the ideal situation in which all possible boundary measurements are available , the correspondence _ boundary data _ @xmath0 _ conductivity _ is highly ( exponentially ) unstable . as a consequence it is evident that , in practice , it is impossible to distinguish high resolution features of the interior from limited and noisy boundary data , @xcite .    motivated by applications ,",
    "a line of investigation pursued by many authors , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , has been the one of limiting the analysis to cases in which one seeks an unknown interior inclusion embedded in an otherwise known ( may be even homogeneous ) conductor , and whose conductivity is assumed to differ from the background .    even in this restricted case , and even when full boundary data are available , the instability remains of exponential type @xcite .",
    "it is therefore reasonable to further restrict the goal and attempt to evaluate some parameters expressing the size ( area , volume ) of the inclusion , disregarding its precise location and shape , having at our disposal one pair of boundary measurements of voltage and current .",
    "this approach , which can be traced back to @xcite , has been well developed theoretically , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite and @xcite for the analogous treatment in the linear elasticity framework . in order to describe such type of results we need first to introduce some notation .",

    "the boundary @xmath4 of @xmath1 is assumed of lipschitz class , with constants @xmath5 , @xmath6 , that is the boundary can be locally represented as a graph of a lipschitz continuous function with lipschitz constant @xmath6 in some ball of radius @xmath5 .",
    "when no inclusion is present in the conductor we assume that it is homogeneous and we pose its conductivity @xmath7 .",
    "when the conductor contains an unknown inclusion @xmath8 of different conductivity , say @xmath9 , @xmath10 the overall conductivity in the conductor will be given by @xmath11 .",
    "here and in what follows it is assumed that @xmath8 is strictly contained in @xmath1 .",
