    "mixed valence manganites with the perovskite structure r@xmath7a@xmath8mno@xmath9 ( r = lanthanide , a = alkali - earth metal ) have been the subject of renewed interest since the discovery of a colossal magnetoresistance ( cmr ) at suitable compositions , @xcite probably the most spectacular manifestation of their half - metallic ( i.e.  spin - polarized ) electronic transport .",
    "the interplay between half metallic conduction and ferromagnetism is generally understood on the basis of the spin - conserving transfer of an @xmath10 hole between two neighboring mn ions , assisted by the ligand @xmath11 orbital , referred to as double exchange ( de ) .",
    "@xcite due to the strong hund - rule coupling between @xmath10 states and @xmath12 core shells , the hole transfer is energetically favored only in the presence of a ferromagnetic ( fm ) order . in turn , de can be viewed at as an effective ferromagnetic exchange interactions between manganese ions , mediated by mobile holes .",
    "such an interaction competes with antiferromagnetic ( af ) terms ( i.e.  superexchange ) dominant in the undoped or underdoped materials , where they lead to af insulating phases . above a critical hole concentration @xmath2 ( e.g.  @xmath13 in ) ,",
    "@xcite double exchange dominates and drives the system into a fm - ordered half - metallic ground state . at finite temperatures ,",
    "the fluctuating component of the magnetic moment behaves as a spin - flipping scattering term which reduces the polarization of charge carriers .",
    "the half - metallic band is disrupted at the curie point @xmath3 , which also coincides with a metal - insulator ( mi ) transition .    while the general agreement on the major role of double exchange in the physics of cmr manganites has never been challenged since zener s work,@xcite",
    "the relevance of other interactions was stressed after their revival of interest in the nineties .",
    "for instance , millis _ et al._@xcite pointed out that a detailed description of the mi transition at @xmath3 requires taking into account the electron - lattice coupling of the  ion , which is large in view of its jahn - teller character .",
    "such a coupling term contributes to the effective mass of holes and favors their localization into jahn - teller polarons above @xmath3 .",
    "the critical temperature @xmath3 varies with doping and exhibits , for each manganite family , a maximum at an optimal hole concentration @xmath14 .",
    "@xcite it strongly depends , however , also on the a - site cations .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 ranges from 370  k in optimally doped  ( lsmo ) down to approx .  268  k in   ( lcmo ) , while the pr - ca series ( pcmo ) does not exhibit any metallic fm phase .",
    "@xcite the dependence of @xmath3 on the a - site isoelectronic substitution is understood in terms of the distortions and tilting of the mno@xmath15 octahedra ( minimal in lsmo , maximal in pcmo ) induced by the size mismatch of the cation.@xcite such distortions reduce the overlap of the mn an ligand wave functions , either bending the mn - o - m bond or increasing the mn - o bonding distance . within the framework of zener s model , this also weakens the de integral , resulting in a smaller electronic bandwidth and hence a lower @xmath3 .",
    "the nature itself of the magnetic transition apparently depends on the electronic bandwidth .",
    "inelastic neutron scattering,@xcite @xmath16sn mssbauer spectroscopy , @xcite and @xmath17la nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) , @xcite revealed a regular second order transition in nearly optimally doped lsmo and , on the other hand , `` truncated '' ( i.e.  first - order ) ones in lcmo and other narrow - band manganites .",
    "the truncation effect is apparent from the dispersion curve of magnetic neutron scattering , in the form of a spin wave stiffness which does not renormalize to zero at @xmath3 . @xcite",
    "as seen from microscopic probes of magnetism like mssbauer and nmr spectroscopies , which detect a hyperfine field directly proportional to the local magnetization , truncation shows up as a finite order parameter and a phase - separated magnetic state at the curie point , whereby the volume of the ordered phase , rather than the order parameter , vanishes for @xmath18 .",
    "the first - order character of the transition indicates that the transition is not governed by critical magnetic fluctuations . the large oxygen isotopic effect on @xmath3 in lcmo",
    "@xcite demonstrates that lattice excitations , identified with jahn - teller polarons , are involved . the spin wave dispersion , hence the exchange coupling , on the other hand , are however unaffected by the oxygen isotope substitution .",
    "@xcite these observations suggest that the mi transition is driven by the formation of a polaron phase above @xmath3 , which abruptly disrupts both the metallic state and the fm order .",
    "the literature on the character of the magnetic transition , either first or second order , in cmr manganites , is nevertheless sparse .",
    "moreover , each of the microscopic probes employed in such studies is affected by problems and limitations .",
    "for instance , neutron scattering can access the nature of the transition only indirectly through the spin wave stiffness , @xcite contrary to the local probes of magnetism , which detect directly a hyperfine field proportional to the order parameter . among the latter",
    ", however , mssbauer spectroscopy requires substituting a non - magnetic ion at the mn site , which perturbs appreciably the systems even at moderate substitutions , as it is apparent from the reduced @xmath3.@xcite on the other hand , zero field ( zf ) nmr is not usually applicable in the critical region due to the drop of the resonance frequency and the divergence of the spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath19 as @xmath3 is approached , unless the truncation effect on the transition is severe.@xcite    in this paper we report an investigation of the order parameter in the optimally doped  ( lcsmo ) isoelectronic series as a function of @xmath4 .",
    "the ca - sr solid solution behaves as a virtual cation interpolating between ca and sr , and provides a continuous control over the induced lattice distortions , hence on the electronic bandwidth , at constant hole concentration .",
    "the two end members  and  are also investigated as a function of hole concentration @xmath2 in the underdoping regime , @xmath20 .",
    "the comparison of the @xmath2 and @xmath4 dependences is aimed at unraveling the effect of charge on the order parameter and the type of magnetic transition , from those of distortions . for reference ,",
    "the crystal cell parameters and mn - o - mn bond angle are determined by x - ray diffraction .",
    "the order parameter is studied as a function of temperature by combining zf @xmath1mn nmr and muon spin rotation ( @xmath0sr ) .",
    "the two techniques effectively complement one another .",
    "@xmath0sr overcomes the aforementioned limits of nmr close to the magnetic transitions , but is afflicted in turn by line broadening and anomalies in the precession frequencies at lower temperature , seemingly related to frozen local disorder at the muon site .",
    "the isotropic and essentially on - site hyperfine field at @xmath1mn , on the contrary , is insensitive to such disorder and exhibits smooth temperature dependencies .",
    "the combination of @xmath0sr close to @xmath3 and nmr well below provides therefore a reliable microscopic determination of the order parameter .",
    "we found second order transitions throughout the optimally doped lcsmo series and , in contrast , first order transitions in underdoped metallic lcmo ( @xmath21 ) and lsmo ( @xmath22 ) , despite the much higher @xmath3 in e.g.  than in optimally doped .",
    "these findings , along with the scaling properties of the order parameter curves , indicate that the effective exchange coupling is primarily governed by distortions and the truncation phenomenon by charge doping .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : experiment ] provides a brief description of sample preparation and x - ray characterization , as well as of the experimental apparatus and methods .",
    "the experimental results achieved by @xmath0sr , @xmath1mn nmr , and the combination of the two microscopic probes , are illustrated in distinct subsections of sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] .",
    "the effects of charge and lattice distortions the order parameter and the nature of the magnetic transition , as they appear from the two local probes of magnetism , are finally discussed in section [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "two appendices deal with the couplings of the two probes to the local magnetic moments in metallic manganites .",
    "the nature of the @xmath2-dependent hyperfine field at the @xmath1mn nucleus is dealt with in appendix  [ sec : coupling.nmr ] , while the origin of the discrepancies between the internal fields and the relaxations experienced by muons and nuclei is discussed to some extent in appendix [ sec : coupling.muon ] .",
    "the polycrystalline samples were obtained by a standard solid - state reaction from la@xmath23o@xmath9 , caco@xmath9 , srco@xmath9 and mno@xmath23 .",
    "reagents were dehydrated for several hours in a furnace at 150 c for one day .",
    "the la@xmath23o@xmath9 was further heated for several days at 1100 c in order to eliminate any trace of lanthanum hydroxide .",
    "reagents were ground by a pulverisette  7 machine , weighed in stoichiometric amounts in inert and dry atmosphere , pelletized , fired in air at 1200 c for 12 hours in a furnace , and finally cooled slowly to room temperature .",
    "the reaction products were then reground and subject three times to the above thermal treatment - the last one at 1360 c for 20 hours - in order to ensure a complete decomposition of the carbonates .    the final characterization by x - ray powder diffraction revealed in the various samples a crystal structure belonging to the r@xmath24c or pnma space groups , as appropriate of lsmo and lcmo , respectively .  with @xmath25 , showing",
    "a nanoscale admixture of the two structures , is a special case , discussed below . in any case",
    ", no spurious phases was ever detected .",
    "powder x - ray diffraction data from the lcsmo and lsmo samples were collected at room temperature using cu - ka radiation with a thermo electron corporation xtra^^ diffractometer equipped with a si(li ) energy selective detector .",
    "diffraction patterns were acquired in the range @xmath26 with a step of @xmath27 .",
    "structural refinement was carried out for each composition by the rietveld method implemented in the gsas package.@xcite the refinement was mostly aimed at determining the mn - o bond lengths and mn - o - mn bond angles as a function of composition . in particular , we regard bond angles as the characteristic distortion parameters of the perovskite cell .",
    "the rietveld refinements yielded accurate fits of the x - ray powder diffraction patterns of  at the sr - rich ( @xmath28 ) and the ca - rich ( @xmath29 ) ends of the phase diagram .",
    "low-@xmath4 lcsmo exhibits the rhombohedral symmetry of the r@xmath24c space group , while the high-@xmath4 compositions belong to the orthorhombic system ( pnma space group ) , in agreement with the literature . at intermediate cation substitutions",

    "[ fig:2theta ] for a representative sample , where a portion of a @xmath31 scan is plotted , overlaid to the diffraction patterns fitted according to the r@xmath24c and pnma space groups .",
    "the observed profile qualitatively coincides with the superposition of the r@xmath24c and pnma patterns , which indicates the coexistence of the two structures .",
    "the poor quantitative agreement of a two - component fit , as well as the excess linewidth of the observed peaks , however , rule out a macroscopic phase mixture , and rather point to the spontaneous segregation of nanoscopic orthorhombic and rhombohedral clusters . the same nanoscale phase separation , with similar intermiscibility limits of ca and sr ,",

    "soft restraints were applied to the mean mn - o distance , in order to achieve fit convergence and to account for the weak contribution to x - ray scattering from oxygen atoms .",
    "such restraints were tuned on the basis of the known structural properties of manganese perovskites reported in a vast literature .",
    "the refined values for the mn - o - mn angles and mn - o distances in lcsmo are plotted in fig .",

    "the figure clearly shows that in the lcsmo system the deviation from the mn - o - mn collinearity , i.e.  the tilting of the mno@xmath15 octahedra , increases smoothly with increasing @xmath4 , without any apparent singularity at the transition from the r@xmath24c to the pnma structure .",

    "@xcite the usage of a non - resonant circuit , on the other hand , allowed the automation of unattended frequency scans .",
    "a conventional tuned lc circuit was sometimes employed only very close to @xmath3 , in order to improve sensitivity and approach the transition as close as possible .",
    "the inhomogeneously broadened spectra were recorded point by point by exciting spin echoes at discrete frequencies by means of a standard @xmath54 pulse sequence , with delays @xmath55 of 2.5 - 4 @xmath56 , and equal rf pulses @xmath57 of 0.3 - 1.4 @xmath56 with intensity optimized for maximum signal .",

    "this criterion is preferred in practice over the textbook method of assigning the zero - shift fft component , @xcite as it partly compensates for the possible spectral hole burning at the center of the irradiated band .",
    "such an artifact , due to overdriven spin echoes , is often encountered in the nmr of ferromagnets , where it usually originates from the spatial and/or spectral inhomogeneity of the enhancement factor .",
