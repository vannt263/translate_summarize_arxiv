    "the superhump phenomenon was first observed in superoutbursts of dwarf novae of short orbital period ( @xmath3 : see warner 1995b ) . it can be explained as an effect of an eccentric disc that precesses with respect to the tidal field of the secondary star ( whitehurst 1988 ) . in low mass ratio binaries ( @xmath4 )",
    ", disc eccentricity can be excited via tidal resonance ( whitehurst 1988 , hirose & osaki 1990 , lubow 1991 ) . in systems with larger",
    "@xmath5 however , the disc is truncated at too small a radius for the resonance to be effective .",
    "observationally there is evidence that discs can be tidally resonant for @xmath5 significantly greater than @xmath6 .",
    "superhumps appear in high mass transfer discs ( those of nova - like variables and of nova remnants ) in some systems with orbital periods up to 3.5 h ( skillman et al .",
    "1998 ) . at this period the mass of the secondary star is @xmath7 ( equation 2.100 of warner 1995b ) .",
    "unfortunately there are no reliable determinations of @xmath5 in the superhumping systems with @xmath8h .",
    "the mean mass of the primaries of the nova - likes is @xmath9 ( warner 1995b ) and the range is likely to be at least @xmath10 .",
    "if the primary mass is at the upper end of this range , it is therefore possible that a system with @xmath11h would have a mass ratio approaching that needed for the eccentric resonance to lie within the accretion disc .    there can be little doubt that a mechanism is required to extend the range of mass ratios for which tidal resonance occurs , beyond the @xmath4 established in equilibrium disc calculations .",
    "one possibility is suggested by the vy  scl stars , systems with orbital periods in the range @xmath12 h ( warner 1995b ) in which mass transfer is liable to reduce significantly at irregular intervals .",
    "such a drop in @xmath13 would allow a tidally stable , equilibrium disc that just marginally fails to reach the eccentric resonance to expand radially and become eccentrically unstable .    in this paper",
    "we demonstrate that the discs in high @xmath14 systems can be excited into an eccentric state when the mass transfer from the secondary drops below its equilibrium value . in the next section",
    "we discuss the observational peculiarities of the vy  scl stars . in section three",
    "we outline our model for superhumps in these systems .",
    "we present numerical results that support our case in section four , and make our conclusions in section five .",
    "the long - term light curves of nova - like variables show brightness variations on a range of time - scales .",
    "quasi - periodic modulations with ranges @xmath15 mag and time - scales of @xmath16 months may be intrinsic to the disc and in effect suppress dwarf nova outbursts in which the thermal instability of the disc is modified by irradiation from the white dwarf primary ( warner 1995a ) .",
    "larger brightness variations on time - scales from days to years are also seen , in which the star shows a `` bright state '' before falling from 1 to 5 magnitudes in brightness .",
    "this behaviour is named after the type star , vy  sculptoris , and is generally believed to be the result of significant and relatively rapid drops in mass transfer from the secondary .    the known vy  scl stars ( table 4.1 in warner 1995b ) have orbital periods in the range @xmath17 h. two apparently discrepant systems , v794  aql and v745  cyg have since had their orbits redetermined .",
    "thorstensen ( private communication ) found the orbital period of v745 cyg to be @xmath18 h , and honeycutt & robertson ( 1998 ) found the period of v794  aql to be @xmath19 h. furthermore , every nova - like variable in the 3.0 to 4.0 h @xmath20 range that has a well observed long - term light curve has been found to be of vy  scl type ( warner 1995b ) .",
    "unstable mass transfer in these systems may be due to irradiation of the secondary by the primary ( wu , wickramasinghe & warner , 1995 ) .    as a consequence , in the range @xmath21 h , high @xmath22 , stable accretion discs are subject to occasional reductions of received mass at their outer edge . in the following sections we numerically investigate the disc response .",
    "eccentricity can be excited in a close binary accretion disc if it overlaps or very nearly overlaps the @xmath2 eccentric inner lindblad resonance ( lubow 1991 ) . with a characteristic radius",
    "almost half the interstellar separation , this resonance is only accessible to discs in low mass ratio systems .",
    "tidal forces prevent discs in high mass ratio systems from reaching the resonance .",
    "paczyski ( 1977 ) approximated the streamlines in a pressureless , inviscid disc with ballistic particle trajectories .",
    "he then suggested that such a disc could not be larger than the largest ballistic orbit that does nt intersect orbits interior to it . using paczyski s estimate ,",
    "hirose & osaki ( 1990 ) , and lubow ( 1991 ) found that the @xmath2 resonance could only be reached if @xmath23 .",
    "but the tides that truncate a close binary disc also remove angular momentum from it .",
    "papaloizou & pringle ( 1977 ) calculated the tidal removal of angular momentum from a disc comprised of gas in linearly perturbed circular orbits .",
    "they estimated that the disc would need to extend out to approximately @xmath24 times the mean roche lobe radius for tidal torques to be effective ( slightly beyond the paczyski radius ) .",
    "however the assumption of linearity made by papaloizou & pringle lead to an underestimate of the dissipation in the neighbourhood of paczyski s orbit crossing radius and thus to a larger estimate for the tidal radius .",
    "thus when whitehurst & king ( 1991 ) used the papaloizou & pringle value for maximum disc size , they estimated that the @xmath2 resonance could be reached in systems with @xmath5 as high as @xmath1 .    for near equilibrium discs subjected to a fixed rate of mass addition from the secondary",
    ", the numerical results are more in keeping with the lower mass ratio limit of @xmath6 .",
    "hirose & osaki ( 1990 ) obtained eccentric discs in simulations with @xmath25 , and murray ( 1998 ) for mass ratios @xmath26 .",
    "whitehurst ( 1994 ) found eccentricity in simulations at mass ratios as high as @xmath1 .",
    "however his discs were initialised with a rapid burst of mass transfer and so were not close to an equilibrium when they encountered the @xmath2 resonance .",
    "as discussed in the previous section , the observations are not consistent with a mass ratio limit as low as @xmath6 .",
    "we propose then that higher mass ratio systems can become resonant during periods when the disc is not in equilibrium with the mass transfer stream .",
    "gas passing through the inner lagrangian point has a specific angular momentum with respect to the white dwarf equivalent to that of a circular keplerian orbit of radius @xmath27 .",
    "circularisation radius _ is of the order of a tenth to one fifth the interstellar separation and is very much inside the disc s tidal truncation limit ( lubow & shu , 1975 ) .",
    "hence , mixing with the mass transfer stream reduces specific angular momentum in the outer disc and restricts the disc radially .",
    "of course the principal confinement of the disc is provided by tidal torques , however the additional confinement due to the stream can be significant . if , as is suspected to happen in the vy  scl stars , @xmath13 is suddenly reduced , then the radial restriction on the disc will be relaxed , and the disc will expand . the expansion can be only temporary , as the disc will subsequently adjust to the new @xmath13 on its viscous time - scale , and return to its initial size .",
    "however , we will show in the next section that the period of readjustment can be sufficient to allow the disc to encounter the @xmath2 resonance and become eccentric .",
    "in this section we present numerical results obtained using a two dimensional , fixed spatial resolution , smooth particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) code .",
    "previous calculations and detailed descriptions of the code are to be found in murray ( 1996 , 1998 ) . although the code has been improved to allow for variable spatial resolution ( see e.g. murray , de  kool & li , 1998 ) and for the three dimensional modelling of accretion discs ( murray & armitage , 1998 ) , we found that by restricting ourselves to two dimensions and fixed resolution , we could more thoroughly explore parameter space with a reasonable expenditure of computer time . our ability to capture the essential features of the eccentric instability is not compromised , and previous results have been consistent with those of three dimensional calculations ( see e.g. simpson & wood , 1998 ) .",
    "the simulations described here demonstrate that , in systems with intermediate mass ratio , a sudden reduction in mass transfer from the secondary star can allow an equilibrium disc to expand so as to come into contact with the eccentric resonance .",
    "two sequences of simulations were completed . in the first series we subjected near - equilibrium discs to sudden reductions in @xmath13 , the aim being to demonstrate the viability of the proposed mechanism .",
    "we then completed a second set of simulations in which we replaced the mass transfer stream with steady mass addition at the circularisation radius , @xmath27 . by removing the additional constraining effect of the stream , and allowing the disc to reach a _",
    "fully extended _ steady state , we made it as easy as possible for the disc to interact with the eccentric resonance .",
    "we ran such simulations for several values of @xmath5 and thus determined the range of mass ratios for which a reduction in mass transfer might result in superhumps .",
    "as in murray ( 1996 ) and murray ( 1998 ) , we use the interstellar separation @xmath28 , the binary mass @xmath29 , and the inverse of the orbital angular velocity @xmath30 , as the length , mass and time scalings for our simulations .",
    "in murray ( 1998 ) we described a calculation for mass ratio @xmath31 that failed to excite the eccentric resonance ( simulation 1 of that paper ) . in that calculation mass",
    "was introduced at a constant rate of one particle per @xmath32@xmath30 at the inner lagrangian point .",
    "an isothermal equation of state was used with @xmath33@xmath34 .",
    "the spatial resolution was fixed with the smoothing length @xmath35@xmath28 .",
    "the high rate of viscous dissipation that occurs in cv discs in outburst was modelled using an artificial viscosity term ( murray 1996 , 1998 ) .",
    "the artificial viscosity parameter @xmath36 .",
    "the gave an effective shakura - sunyaev parameter @xmath37 at the resonance radius .",
    "this was somewhat on the high side but made the calculations more manageable . at the end of the simulation ( @xmath38@xmath30 ) the non - resonant disc had an equilibrium mass of 19950 particles .    for this paper we used the final state of the above calculation as the _ initial state _ for a new simulation with @xmath39 ( no mass addition ) .",
    "all other system parameters were left unchanged .",
    "the disc evolution was then followed to @xmath40@xmath30 , by which time there were only 5031 particles remaining in the disc . by plotting the energy",
    "viscously dissipated in the disc as a function of time we obtained a `` light curve '' for the simulation ( figure  [ vyscldiss ] ) .",
    "the stream - disc impact is responsible for a significant fraction of the energy dissipation in the outer disc .",
    "hence when the accretion stream was shut off ( at @xmath38@xmath30 ) there was a sudden drop in disc luminosity .",
    "almost immediately after mass transfer ceased the accretion disc became resonant and eccentric .",
    "the subsequent motion of the eccentric mode _ relative to the binary frame _ introduced a cyclic contribution to the energy dissipation in the outer disc ( this is discussed in more depth in murray , 1998 ) which we identify as a superhump signal .",
    "figure  [ vyscldiss ] shows the superhumps reaching maximum amplitude somewhere between @xmath41 and @xmath42@xmath30 .",
    "the subsequent decay of both the superhump amplitude and of the background luminosity was simply due to the decline in disc mass .",
    "as the simulation ran we fourier analysed the disc s density distribution using the technique described in lubow ( 1991 ) .",
    "each fourier mode s variation in azimuth and time is given by @xmath43 where @xmath44 is azimuth measured in the inertial frame , @xmath45 is the angular velocity of the binary , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are integers .",
    "hence the disc s eccentricity is measured by the @xmath48 , @xmath49 mode , and the largest amplitude non - resonant tidal response has @xmath50 . in some sense",
    "this latter mode ( which appears in density maps as a two armed spiral pattern fixed in the binary frame ) indicates the radial extent of the disc .",
    "the larger the tidal response , the more disc material there is at large radii .",
    "the strengths of the eccentric and spiral modes are plotted in figure  [ vysclmodes ] .",
    "the tidal mode strength jumped sharply once mass addition ceased , strongly indicating a redistribution of matter radially outward through the disc .",
    "we confirmed this interpretation by checking the actual particle distributions . immediately prior to the demise of the mass transfer stream , @xmath51 of the disc mass was at radii @xmath52@xmath28 .",
    "by @xmath53@xmath30 , this figure had increased to @xmath54% .",
    "there was also an increase in absolute terms from 3636 to 4046 particles .",
    "the eccentric mode also became immediately stronger upon cessation of mass transfer , and then continued to grow as the resonance took effect .",
    "the maximum in the eccentric mode strength coincided with the largest amplitude superhumps .    we have produced a sequence of grey scale density maps of the disc ( figure  [ vyscldensity ] ) ,",
    "from which it is clear that the mass transfer stream did indeed restrict the disc s radial extent . in its original equilibrium state ( top left panel ) , the disc immediately downstream of the stream impact region lay entirely within the roche lobe of the primary .",
    "compare that with the disc shortly after mass transfer had ceased ( top right ) which extended beyond the roche lobe .",
    "having determined the mechanism to be viable , we then investigated whether disc eccentricity could be excited with a less drastic reduction in @xmath13 .",
    "we completed a second calculation with identical initial conditions , but with the mass transfer rate reduced to half its initial value instead of being extinguished completely .",
    "figures  [ vyscldiss2 ] and [ vysclmodes2 ] follow the evolution of the disc to @xmath55@xmath30 , by which time the disc mass had stabilised at approximately 10500 particles .    as in the first simulation",
    ", the disc immediately came into contact with the resonance and became more eccentric .",
    "this time however the superhump amplitude was much reduced .",
    "the eccentricity reached a maximum at @xmath56@xmath30 and then declined . note that despite the reduction in superhump amplitude , the amplitude of the @xmath57 mode was larger in the second calculation ( compare figures [ vysclmodes ] and [ vysclmodes2 ] ) .",
    "whereas the eccentric mode strength is a measure of the eccentricity as a whole , it does not directly measure the eccentricity of individual particle orbits .",
    "the superhump signal , however , is generated by those particles on the most eccentric orbits . in the second simulation ,",
    "the continued mass transfer restricted the maximum eccentricity which could be acquired by gas in the outer disc , and hence limited the superhump amplitude .",
    "we had expected _ a priori _ that the disc would return to an axisymmetric state in equilibrium with the reduced mass flux from the secondary .",
    "however we followed this calculation to @xmath58@xmath30 and were surprised to find that the eccentricity did not decline to zero as expected , but instead stabilised with @xmath59 .",
    "the plot of the tidal @xmath60 mode ( figure  [ vysclmodes2 ] ) and density maps ( not shown ) indicate that the disc returned to its original radial extent by time @xmath61@xmath30 .",
    "there is thus the intriguing possibility that this eccentric state , once reached , was quasi - stable .    to complete this section",
    "we performed a third simulation , in which we took the previous simulation at time @xmath62@xmath30 and restored the mass transfer rate to its original value .",
    "figures  [ vyscldiss3 ] and [ vysclmodes3 ] show that the disc was initially forced rapidly inwards and circularised by the increased mass flux from the secondary .",
    "further adjustment then occurred on the viscous time - scale as the disc re - expanded to its equilibrium radius and mass flux , and the eccentricity decayed away . by the end of the calculation ( @xmath62@xmath30 )",
    "the disc had returned to its original axisymmetric state .      in this section",
    "we describe four simulations of discs built up to steady state from zero initial mass via _ steady _ mass addition at the circularisation radius .",
    "although one would be hard - pressed to find such a disc in nature , it is perhaps the most favourable disc configuration for the excitation of the eccentric resonance .",
    "whereas in the simulations of the previous section the interaction with the resonance was limited to the viscous time - scale , there is no such time limitation in these calculations . thus if , for a given mass ratio , eccentricity can not be excited with this artificially favourable setup , then it is hard to see how it could be excited with more realistic mass input .",
    "hence we can obtain a limiting mass ratio for which mass transfer reductions can inspire superhumps .",
    "as in the previous section we took an isothermal equation of state with @xmath33@xmath34 , an sph smoothing length @xmath35@xmath28 , and set the sph artificial viscosity parameter @xmath36 .",
    "each calculation was terminated at @xmath63@xmath30 .",
    ".summary of steady @xmath13 simulations [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "+ @xmath64 simulation from section 4.2 with @xmath13 half initial value , added at @xmath65 .",
    "simulations were completed for @xmath66 and @xmath1 . in each case",
    ", mass was added at a fixed rate of one particle per @xmath32@xmath30 , at a radius @xmath67@xmath28 ( @xmath27 for a system with @xmath68 ) . by doing this",
    "we have kept the specific angular momentum of newly added material constant across the simulations .",
    "however the angular momentum is somewhat greater ( 14% in the case of @xmath69 ) than if we had used the correct circularisation radius for each mass ratio .",
    "the strength of the eccentric mode at the conclusion of each simulation , and the disc precession periods are listed in table  [ tab : rcirc ] .",
    "the higher the mass ratio , the more weakly the eccentric resonance was excited . for the @xmath69 simulation some volatility could still be discerned in the eccentric mode strength but no superhumps were apparent either in the light curve or in its power spectrum .",
    "we included in table  [ tab : rcirc ] the second of the simulations completed for section 4.2 ( for which @xmath13 was reduced a factor 2 ) .",
    "given its length ( four times that of the calculations completed for this section ) , this calculation provided a very reliable measurement of @xmath70 and thus a useful check on the other results tabulated here .",
    "a mass ratio of approximately @xmath1 would appear to be the upper limit beyond which the eccentric resonance can not be excited even temporarily .",
    "our results correspond well with those of whitehurst ( 1994 ) who found superhumps in a simulation with @xmath69 but not in a simulation with @xmath71 .",
    "he constructed his discs with a massive initial mass transfer burst , followed by a much reduced but constant @xmath13 .",
    "the mass distribution in whitehurst s discs would have been therefore more akin to a disc built up via mass addition at @xmath27 than to a disc subject to steady mass addition from @xmath65 .",
    "under conditions of steady mass transfer , a mass ratio @xmath72 is required for a close binary accretion disc to encounter the @xmath2 eccentric inner lindblad resonance . however , it is possible for eccentricity to be excited in the disc of a high mass transfer system with @xmath73 if @xmath13 is reduced , as is thought to occur in the vy  sculptoris systems .",
    "our simulations suggest that the disc will remain eccentric as long as @xmath13 remains at the lower value .",
