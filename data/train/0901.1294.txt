    "inelastic structure functions . eventually , these should be used , together with resummed expressions for other physical processes , for the determination of parton distributions at the resummed level .",
    "an estimate of the impact of resummation on parton distributions can be obtained by first computing the structure functions @xmath102 and @xmath106 with some typical `` toy '' set of nlo parton distributions ( pdfs ) , and then assuming that the structure functions are kept fixed at some scale : this is then enough to determine the resummed singlet quark and gluon distribution at that scale .",
    "the effect on pdfs is close to that which would be obtained if pdfs were determined from a fit to dis data mostly clustered around that scale .",

    "the impact of the resummation at the `` hera scale '' is comparable to that of nnlo corrections , but it goes in the opposite direction : it tends to suppress the starting pdfs while the nnlo tends to enhance them .",
    "when evolving up the differences tend to be washed out because of asymptotic freedom .",
    "the pdfs displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : pdfbc ] can then be used to determine @xmath109-factors for resummed structure functions : these were computed in ref .",
    "@xcite . there the factorization and renormalization scale dependence of the of results were also studied , and shown to be small .",

    "the pdf uncertainty band is shown for the nlo prediction , while only the central prediction is displayed in the other cases.,title=\"fig : \" ]        the dominant qualitative feature of the @xmath109factors is that resummation leads to a suppression of the structure functions @xmath102 and @xmath106 at small @xmath0 . the @xmath109factors were compared to those determined using the tw approach  @xcite in ref .",
    "the main differences are related to the fact that tw @xmath109-factors can differ sizably from one even at @xmath111 where the abf result matches smoothly to the nlo one , and that the tw @xmath109-factors still show a marked scale dependence at large @xmath112  gev@xmath108 where the scale dependence of the abf result flattens out completely .",
    "these differences are likely to be due to the various features of the tw approach mentioned above : in particular , the lack of matching terms to large @xmath0 , and the fact that the factorization scheme is not treated in a fully consistent way .",
    "indeed , there appears  @xcite to be a significant cancellation of scheme dependence between evolved parton distributions and coefficient functions , which is inevitable spoiled if these are not determined in the same factorization scheme .",
    "@xmath109factors can also be used to determine resummed predictions in an approximate way , by first , computing the @xmath109 factors as discussed above , but using a realistic underlying set of pdfs , then verifying that the values of the @xmath109 factors are reasonably independent of the choice of underlying pdfs , and finally using the @xmath109factors to correct nlo predictions obtained from any pdf set .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : strfctn ] we show the structure functions @xmath102 and @xmath106 at the scale @xmath110 obtained applying either resummed or nnlo @xmath109factors to the nlo prediction from the nnpdf1.0 parton set  @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the suppression due to the resummation in the small @xmath113 region is larger than the one  sigma band due to pdf uncertainties .",
    "these results show that resummation is relevant for deep ",
    "inelastic scattering at a high  energy hadron - electron collider such as a collider based on the lhc ( lhec  @xcite )",
    ". it will be interesting to study the impact on precision lhc processes such as w and z production of resummation corrections , both from their direct effect on partonic cross sections , and their indirect effect due to their impact on the extraction of parton distributions .    in summary",
    ", we have seen that the impact of resummation is as large as that of nnlo corrections in the hera region .",
    "the theoretical framework on which resummed results are based is now on a similar footing as that of standard fixed order perturbation theory , whose reliability is thus extended also to kinematical regions , relevant for hera and the lhc , where nnlo results become unstable .",
