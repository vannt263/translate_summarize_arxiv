    ", the vibrating string provides an excellent topic @xcite , since the solution of the corresponding differential equation can be achieved by several different ways , and useful comparison between the different methods can be provided .",
    "if the string is inhomogeneous , the separation of variables method becomes more involved than for the homogenous case , since the spatial part becomes the solution of a sturm - liouville ( sl ) eigenvalue equation and is no longer a simple sine wave . the sl equation is usually solved by expansion into a basis set of functions ( sine waves for the clamped string ) that will lead to a matrix equation for the expansion coefficients .",
    "the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of this matrix then provide the sl functions , but , the accuracy depends on the size of the basis , and correspondingly on the size of the matrix .",
    "the accuracy of this method can be studied by introducing an entirely different method of solution of the sl equation , which is normally not discussed in the existing teaching literature .",
    "this method , denoted as @xmath1 ( for integral equation method)@xmath2 consists in transforming the sl differential equation into an equivalent integral equation , and solving the latter by an expansion into chebyshev polynomials @xcite , @xcite .",
    "this method has the advantage that its accuracy can be automatically pre - determined by means of an accuracy parameter , the number of mesh points required to achieve a particular accuracy is much smaller than for the more conventional finite difference methods ( by a factor close to 20 ) , and the size of the matrices is kept small by a partition technique , thus avoiding the drawbacks of large matrices in conventional integral equation solution methods .",
    "these advantages are important for the solution of a computationally complex problem @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to explain the @xmath1 method in simple terms , and apply it to the solution of the inhomogeneous vibrating string .",
    "a method to solve the sl iteratively , thus avoiding the introduction of the inaccuracies described above , will also be presented .",
    "this method was first devised by hartree @xcite in the solution of atomic physics energy eigenvalues of the schrdinger equation .",
    "it has now been adapted to the spectral @xmath1 solution of the equivalent integral equation @xcite , and since it can achieve an accuracy of @xmath0 it does provide the bench mark values against which the previous methods for the inhomogeneous string can be compared .",
    "the method for the solution of the string equation is very close to the solution of the important quantum mechanical time independent schrdinger equation . since the properties of the string are much easier to visualize than the properties of the schrdinger equation , the present discussion of the vibrations of the string also serves as a pedagogical introduction to the numerical methods required for quantum mechanics .",
    "the numerical calculations are done with matlab .",
    "an excellent introduction into both matlab  and numerical methods can be found in the book by recktenwald @xcite .",
    "the matlab programs for the calculations presented here will be available in the `` compadre '' digital library @xcite .    in summary ,",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to introduce to the teaching community the use of spectral expansions , especially for the solution of integral equations , because of its elegance , its accuracy , and its computational economy .",
