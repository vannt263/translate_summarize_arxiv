    "a basic question in mathematical finance is how to choose an optimal investment strategy in a securities market or , more specifically , how to maximize utility from consumption .",
    "this is often called the _ merton problem _ because it was solved by merton @xcite for power and logarithmic utility functions in a markovian it process model . in a market with a riskless bank account and one risky asset following a geometric brownian motion , the optimal strategy turns out to invest a _",
    "constant fraction _",
    "@xmath0 of wealth in the risky asset and to consume at a rate proportional to current wealth .",
    "this means that it is optimal for the investor to keep her portfolio holdings in bank and stock on the so - called _ merton line _ with slope @xmath1 .    in a continuous time",
    "setting , proportional transaction costs were introduced to the merton problem by magill and constantinides @xcite .",
    "their paper contains the fundamental insight that it is optimal to refrain from transacting while the portfolio holdings remain in a wedge - shaped _ no - transaction region _ , that is , while the fraction of wealth held in stock lies inside some interval @xmath2 $ ] .",
    "however , their solution is derived in a somewhat heuristic way and also did not show how to compute the location of the boundaries @xmath3 , @xmath4 .",
    "mathematically rigorous results were first obtained in the seminal paper of davis and norman @xcite .",
    "they show that it is indeed optimal to keep the proportion of total wealth held in stock between fractions @xmath3 , @xmath4 and they also prove that these two numbers can be determined as the solution to a free boundary value problem . the theory of viscosity solutions to hamilton  jacobi ",
    "bellman equations was introduced to this problem by shreve and soner @xcite who succeeded in removing several assumptions needed in @xcite .",
    "these articles aiming for the computation of the optimal portfolio employ tools from stochastic control .",
    "it seems that unlike for frictionless markets , martingale methods have so far only been used to obtain structural existence results in the presence of transaction costs . in this context , the martingale and duality theory for frictionless markets is often applied to a _ shadow price process _ @xmath5 lying within the bid - ask bounds of the real price process @xmath6 .",
    "economically speaking , the frictionless price process @xmath5 and the original price process @xmath6 with transaction costs lead to identical decisions and gains for the investor under consideration .",
    "this concept has been used in the context of the fundamental theorem of asset pricing ( cf .",
    "@xcite and recently @xcite ) , local risk minimization @xcite , super - replication @xcite and utility maximization @xcite .    in the present study , we reconsider merton s problem for logarithmic utility and under proportional transaction costs as in @xcite .",
    "our goal is threefold .",
    "most importantly , we show that the shadow price approach can be used to come up with a candidate solution to the utility maximization problem under transaction costs",
    ". moreover , the ensuing verification procedure appears  at least for the problem at hand  to be relatively simple compared to the very impressive and nontrivial reasoning in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "finally , we also construct the shadow price as part of the solution .",
    "for a recent application of the approach of the current paper , we refer to  @xcite .",
    "the more involved case of power utility is treated in @xcite as well .",
    "the application of the present approach to this case is subject of current research .",
    "while it is still possible to come up with a candidate for the shadow price , the corresponding free boundary problem appears to be more difficult than its counterpart in @xcite .",
    "this stems from the fact that it may be more difficult to determine the shadow price than the optimal strategy for power utility ( cf .",
    "remark [ b : connectdn ] for more details ) .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the setup is introduced in section [ s : setup ] .",
    "subsequently , we heuristically derive the free - boundary problem that characterizes the solution . verification is done in section [ s : proofs ] .",
    "we study the problem of maximizing expected logarithmic utility from consumption over an infinite horizon in the presence of proportional transaction costs . except for a slightly larger class of admissible strategies , we work in the setup of @xcite .",
    "the mathematical framework is as follows : fix a complete , filtered probability space @xmath7 supporting a standard brownian motion @xmath8 .",
    "our market consists of two investment opportunities : a bank account or bond with constant value @xmath9 and a risky asset ( `` stock '' ) whose discounted price process @xmath6 is modelled as a geometric brownian motion , that is , @xmath10 with @xmath11 and constants @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "we consider an investor who disposes of an _ initial endowment _",
    "@xmath14 , referring to the number of bonds and stocks , respectively .",
    "whenever stock is purchased or sold , transaction costs are imposed equal to a constant fraction of the amount transacted , the fractions being @xmath15 on purchase and @xmath16 on sale , not both being equal to zero . since transactions of infinite variation lead to instantaneous ruin , we limit ourselves to the following set of strategies .",
    "a _ trading strategy _ is an @xmath17-valued predictable process @xmath18 of finite variation , where @xmath19 and @xmath20 denote the number of shares held in the bank account and in stock at time @xmath21 , respectively .",
    "a ( discounted ) _ consumption rate _ is an @xmath22-valued , adapted stochastic process @xmath23 satisfying @xmath24 a.s .",
    "for all @xmath25 .",
    "a pair @xmath26 of a trading strategy @xmath27 and a consumption rate @xmath23 is called _ portfolio / consumption pair_.    to capture the notion of a self - financing strategy , we use the intuition that no funds are added or withdrawn . to this end",
    ", we write the second component @xmath28 of any strategy @xmath27 as difference @xmath29 of two increasing processes @xmath30 and @xmath31 which do not grow at the same time .",
    "moreover , we denote by @xmath32 the bid and ask price of the stock , respectively .",
    "the proceeds of selling stock must be added to the bank account while the expenses from consumption and the purchase of stock have to be deducted from the bank account in any infinitesimal period @xmath33 $ ] , that is , we require @xmath34 for _ self - financing strategies_. written in integral terms , this amounts to the _ self - financing condition _",
    "@xmath35 in our setup ( [ e : price ] , [ e : bidask ] ) , we obviously have @xmath36 and @xmath37 but the above definition makes sense for discontinuous bid and ask price processes @xmath38 as well .",
    "the second and third term on the right - hand side represent the cumulative amount of wealth gained selling , respectively , spent buying stock , while the last term represents cumulated consumption .",
    "partial integration similarly as in @xcite , i.4.49b , shows that for @xmath39 , we recover the usual self - financing condition in frictionless markets ( cf .",
    "@xcite for more details ) .",
    "the value of a portfolio is not obvious either because securities have no unique price .",
    "as is common in the literature , we use the value that would be obtained if the portfolio were to be liquidated immediately .",
    "[ d : optimal ] the ( _ liquidation _ ) _ value process _ of a trading strategy @xmath27 is defined as @xmath40 a self - financing portfolio / consumption pair @xmath26 is called _ admissible _ if @xmath41,@xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "an admissible pair @xmath26 is called _ optimal _ if it maximizes @xmath44 over all admissible portfolio / consumption pairs @xmath45 , where @xmath46 denotes a fixed given _",
    "impatience rate_.    note that the `` true '' price process @xmath6 is irrelevant for the problem as it does not appear in the definitions ; only the bid and ask prices @xmath47 matter .",
    "moreover , since @xmath46 , the value function of the merton problem _ without _ transaction costs is finite by @xcite , theorem 2.1 .",
    "hence , it follows that this holds in the present setup with transaction costs as well .",
    "our notion of admissible strategies is slightly more general than that in @xcite .",
    "however , it will turn out later on that the optimal strategies in both sets coincide .    for any admissible policy @xmath48 in the sense of @xcite ,",
    "there exists a trading strategy @xmath49 such that @xmath26 is an admissible portfolio / con sumption pair .",
    "the initial endowment in @xcite can be expressed in terms of wealth as @xmath50 . define @xmath51 , @xmath52 as in @xcite , ( 3.1 ) , and set @xmath53 , @xmath54 a simple calculation shows that @xmath55 is an admissible portfolio / consumption pair .",
    "as indicated in the , the martingale approach relies decisively on shadow price processes , which we define as follows .",
    "we call a semimartingale @xmath56 _ shadow price process _ if @xmath57 and if the maximal expected utilities for @xmath58 and for the price process @xmath56 _ without _ transaction costs coincide .    obviously ,",
    "the maximal expected utility for any frictionless price process @xmath56 satisfying ( [ e : dazwischen ] ) is at least as high as for the original market with transaction costs , since the investor is always buying at @xmath59 and selling for @xmath60 .",
    "a shadow price process can be interpreted as a kind of least favourable frictionless market extension .",
    "the corresponding optimal portfolio trades only when the shadow price happens to coincide with the bid or ask price , respectively .",
    "otherwise , it would achieve higher profits with @xmath56 than with @xmath6 and transaction costs .",
    "let us assume that such a shadow price process @xmath56 exists . if it were known in the first place , it would be of great help because portfolio selection problems without transaction costs are considerably easier to solve .",
    "but it is not known at this stage .",
    "hence , we must solve the problems of determining @xmath56 and of portfolio optimization relative to @xmath56 simultaneously .    to this end",
    ", we parametrize the shadow price process in the following form : @xmath61 with some @xmath62$]-valued process @xmath63 where @xmath64 since @xmath6 is an it process , we expect @xmath56 and hence @xmath63 to be it processes as well .",
    "we even guess that @xmath63 is an it diffusion , that is , @xmath65 with some deterministic functions @xmath66 .",
    "any admissible portfolio / consumption pair @xmath26 is completely determined by @xmath23 and the fraction of wealth invested in stocks @xmath67 where bookkeeping is done here relative to shadow prices @xmath56 . hence , we must determine four unknown objects , namely the ansatz functions @xmath68 , @xmath69 as well as the optimal consumption rate @xmath23 and the optimal fraction @xmath70 of wealth in stocks .",
    "standard results yield the optimal strategy for the frictionless price process @xmath56 .",
    "for example , by @xcite , theorem 3.1 , we have @xmath71 where @xmath72 denotes the value process of @xmath27 in the frictionless market with price process @xmath5 .",
    "this already determines the optimal consumption rate . to simplify the following calculations , we assume @xmath73 and work with @xmath74 instead of @xmath70 . by ( [ e : pi ] ) this implies @xmath75 .",

    "we obtain such conditions heuristically as follows . in order to lead to finite maximal expected utility",
    ", the shadow price process should be arbitrage - free and hence allow for an equivalent martingale measure .",
    "this in turn means that @xmath56 and hence also @xmath63 should not have any singular part in their semimartingale decomposition .",
    "put differently , we expect the it process representation ( [ e : defc ] ) to hold even when @xmath63 reaches the boundary points @xmath88 .",
    "the number of shares of stock @xmath28 , on the other hand , changes only when @xmath63 hits the boundary . as this is likely to happen only on a lebesgue - null set of times",
    ", @xmath28  must have a singular part in order to move at all . in view of the connection between @xmath28 and @xmath89",
    ", this suggests that @xmath89 has a singular part as well .",
    "this means that @xmath82 can not be a @xmath90 function on the closed interval @xmath62 $ ] because otherwise @xmath81 would be an it process , too .",
    "a natural way out is the ansatz @xmath91 in order for @xmath89 to have a singular part at the boundary .",
    "hence , we complement ode ( [ e : odef ] ) by boundary conditions @xmath92 in order to avoid infinite derivatives , we consider instead the inverse function .",
    "equation ( [ e : odef ] ) turns into @xmath93 on the a priori unknown interval @xmath94:=[f(\\overline { c}),f(\\underline{c})]$ ] and ( [ e : rand ] ) translates into free boundary conditions @xmath95 equations ( [ e : odeg ] ) , ( [ e : randg ] ) together with ( [ e : shadowprice])([e : schattenwealth ] ) and @xmath96 constitute our ansatz for the portfolio optimization problem .    in summary , the solution to the free boundary problem ( [ e : odeg ] ) , ( [ e : randg])or equivalently ( [ e : odef ] ) , ( [ e : rand])leads to the optimal strategy .",
    "the ode itself is derived based on the optimality of @xmath70 for @xmath56 and the constancy of @xmath28 on @xmath76\\!]}0,t{[\\![}$ ] . in the next section ,",
    "we show that this ansatz indeed yields the true solution .",
    "our result resembles @xcite in that the solution is expressed in terms of a free boundary problem .",
    "however , both the ode and the boundary conditions are different , since the function @xmath97 refers to the shadow price process from the present dual approach and therefore does not appear explicitly in the framework of @xcite ( but cf .",
    "remark [ b : connectdn ] ) .",
    "we turn now to verification of the candidate solution from the previous section .",
    "the idea is rather simple . using ( [ e : shadowprice ] ) , ( [ e : defc ] ) , we define a candidate shadow price process @xmath56 . in order to prove that it is indeed a shadow price process , we show that the optimal portfolio relative to @xmath56 trades only at the boundaries @xmath47",
    ". however , existence of a solution to stochastic differential equation ( sde ) ( [ e : defc ] ) is not immediately obvious .",
    "therefore , we consider instead the corresponding skorokhod sde for @xmath81 with instantaneous reflection at some boundaries @xmath98 .",
    "the process @xmath99 is then defined in a second step .",
    "we begin with an existence result for the free boundary value problem derived above .",

    "since sales and purchases take place at the same prices as in the market with transaction costs @xmath262 , @xmath263 and price process @xmath6 , the portfolio / consumption pair @xmath26 is admissible in this market as well .",
    "conversely , since shares can be bought at least as cheaply and sold as least as expensively , any admissible consumption rate in the market with price process @xmath6 and transaction costs is admissible in the frictionless market with price process @xmath5 , too .",
    "hence , @xmath26 is optimal in the market with transaction costs as well .",
    "made precise , this is stated in the following theorem .",
    "[ l : optimal2 ] the portfolio / consumption pair @xmath26 defined in lemma [ l : optimal1 ] and ( [ e : modify ] ) is also optimal in the market with price process @xmath6 and proportional transaction costs @xmath264 , @xmath262 . in particular",

    "let @xmath265 be an admissible portfolio / consumption pair in the market with price process @xmath6 and transaction costs @xmath262 , @xmath263 .",
    "by @xmath266 and the self - financing condition ( [ e : selff2 ] ) , @xmath267 together with @xmath266 it follows that @xmath268 is an admissible portfolio / consumption pair in the frictionless market with price process @xmath56 .",
    "by optimality of @xmath26 defined in lemma [ l : optimal1 ] , this implies @xmath269 therefore , it remains to prove that @xmath26 is admissible in the market with price process @xmath6 and proportional transaction costs @xmath263 , @xmath262 .",
    "let us begin with @xmath27 as in lemma  [ l : optimal2 ] , that is , without the modification from ( [ e : modify ] ) .",
    "since @xmath210 and @xmath211 increase only on the sets @xmath270 and @xmath271 , respectively , the self - financing condition for @xmath26 and ( [ e : strategy ] ) yield @xmath272 this shows that @xmath26 is self - financing in the market with price process @xmath6 and transaction costs @xmath263 , @xmath273 .",
    "we now turn back to @xmath27 as in ( [ e : modify ] ) . by definition of @xmath274 ,",
    "both sides of ( [ e : selff2 ] ) are unaffected by this modification , at least if the initial values of @xmath275 are chosen accordingly .",
    "this implies that the slightly changed @xmath26 is self - financing for @xmath276 , @xmath262 as well . by @xmath249 , @xmath277 ,",
    "it is also admissible .",
    "this completes the proof .    in the language of @xcite ,",
    "the optimal policy is @xmath48 with @xmath278 in particular , it belongs to the slightly smaller set of admissible controls in @xcite , where the cumulative values @xmath279 of purchases and sales are supposed to be right continuous .",
    "therefore , the optimal strategies in our and their setup coincide .",
    "[ b : connectdn ] in the case of logarithmic utility , it is possible to recover the shadow price @xmath5 from the results of @xcite .",
    "general results on logarithmic utility maximization in frictionless markets show that the optimal consumption rate @xmath23 equals the @xmath280-fold of the investor s current wealth measured in terms of the shadow price .",
    "hence , the consumption rate calculated in @xcite determines the shadow value process @xmath240 , which in turn allows to back out the shadow price @xmath5 .",
    "more precisely , the shadow price can be constructed in a very subtle way using the results of @xcite , as was pointed out to us by the very insightful comments of an anonymous referee : in the proof of @xcite , theorem 5.1 , it is shown that the value function is of the form @xmath281 with functions @xmath282 related through the identity @xmath283 differentiating ( [ e : vfdn ] ) and inserting ( [ e : remarkable ] ) leads to @xmath284 in view of @xcite , theorem 4.3 , this shows that the optimal consumption policy is given by @xmath285 . by @xcite ,",
    "theorem 3.1 , this implies that the optimal value process w.r.t .",
    "the shadow price is given by @xmath286 a close look at the construction of the function @xmath287 in the proof of @xcite , theorem 5.1 , reveals that @xmath287 is increasing with @xmath288 when @xmath289 hits the lower boundary , resp .",

    "therefore , it follows from @xcite , ( 3.1 ) , that @xmath291 for the optimal trading strategy @xmath292 corresponding to the optimal policy @xmath293 of @xcite .",
    "this shows that @xmath294 coincides with the shadow price process @xmath5 constructed above .",
    "however , if one wants to verify that @xmath294 indeed is a shadow price without using the results provided here , the ensuing verification procedure appears to be as involved as our approach of dealing with the utility optimization problem and the computation of the shadow price process simultaneously .",
    "more specifically , one knows by construction that @xmath294 is @xmath295$]-valued and positioned at the respective boundary whenever the strategy @xmath27 trades . by the proof of theorem  [ l : optimal2 ] , it therefore suffices to show that @xmath296 is optimal w.r.t .",
    "@xmath297 in order for @xmath294 to be a shadow price . in view of @xcite ,",
    "theorem 3.1 , this amounts to verifying that @xmath298 for the differential semimartingale characteristics @xmath299 of the continuous process @xmath294 . in particular , one has to prove that the properties of the function @xmath287 ensure that @xmath6 is an it process and calculate its it decomposition . the optimality condition ( [ e : optimalitydn ] ) then has to be verified using @xcite , ( 5.7 ) , which leads to rather tedious computations .",
    "moreover , the analysis of @xcite requires the technical condition b , which is not needed for our approach .    as a side remark ,",
    "it is interesting to note that this link between optimal policy and shadow price is only apparent for logarithmic utility .",
    "therefore , it is not possible to extract the shadow price from the results of @xcite for power utility functions @xmath300 . using the present approach of solving for the optimal strategy and the shadow price",
    "simultaneously still leads to equations for the optimal strategy and the shadow price .",
    "however , the corresponding free boundary problem appears to be more complicated than its counterpart in @xcite . at this stage",
    "it is not clear whether this additional complexity can be removed through suitable transformations as in the proof of @xcite , theorem 5.1 , or whether the shadow price is indeed more difficult to obtain than the optimal policy for power utility .",
