    "scalar - tensor ( st ) gravitational theories are the most firm candidates for extensions of general relativity ( gr ) .",
    "a great part of their interest comes from the fact that they are induced naturally in the reduction to four dimensions of string and kaluza - klein models@xcite , resulting mostly in the form of a brans - dicke ( bd ) type of st theorybransdicke , often involving also non - minimal coupling to matter , leading to the so called fifth force@xcite .",
    "it is also interesting that st theories are shown to be mathematically equivalent to theories with action depending non - linearly on the ricci scalar , the so called @xmath0 theories@xcite .",
    "finally , st theories are possibly the simplest extension of gr that could accommodate cosmological issues as inflation and universe - expansion acceleration , as well as possible space - time variation of fundamental constants@xcite . on the other hand , observational and experimental",
    "evidence puts strong limits to the observable effects of a possible scalar field .",
    "for example , in the case of a massless scalar the bd parameter @xmath1 is constrained by precise solar - system experiments to be a large number ( @xmath2)bertotti . in this way",
    ", st gravity phenomenology appears to be very similar to that of gr , thus putting strong limits to possible experimental verifications .",
    "there is however a very interesting extension of st gravity put forward by mbelek and lachize - rey@xcite , which could allow electromagnetic ( em ) fields to modify the space - time metric far more strongly than predicted by gr and standard st theories .",
    "the theory was applied in cosmological@xcite and galactic@xcite contexts , and in@xcite it was used to explain the discordancy in the measurements of newton gravitational constant as due to the effect of the earth s magnetic field .",
    "the key new element of that theory is an additional , external scalar field @xmath3 , minimally coupled to gravity . in@xcite it was shown that a general st theory that includes an external field @xmath3 with the mentioned characteristics , and with the magnitude of the coupling derived in@xcite , can explain the unusual forces on asymmetric resonant cavities recently reported@xcite .",

    "@xmath66 one has    @xmath94    for propagation along the electric field , @xmath95 , with @xmath69 @xmath70 , one then has    @xmath96    again , it is easy to see that the last relation is satisfied , for arbitrary longitudinal component @xmath97 , only if @xmath98 , with the standard plane em wave relations for @xmath74 and @xmath65 ; while the longitudinal component @xmath97 must be zero in order to satisfy ( [ dtheta ] ) . in this way , the standard plane em wave is the only solution in this case .    for propagation perpendicular to the zero order field , one has now @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , and the general system ( [ full ] ) can be reduced to@xmath103    if @xmath86 , one has @xmath83 , with the same value ( [ small ] ) as in the case of @xmath63 , while if @xmath81 one has the much larger value@xmath104      from the previous subsections it is seen that the more noticeable effects are obtained for propagation perpendicular to the zero order fields , with the appropriate polarization of the wave in each case",
    ". moreover , comparing ( [ gammalineare ] ) with ( [ gamalinear ] ) it is clear that , from a practical point of view , magnetic fields are preferable . in any case , when the beam traverses a length @xmath105 , the relative variation of the amplitude @xmath106 of any field is given by @xmath107    for the case of a magnetic field of 1 t , with @xmath86 , one can thus estimate from ( [ chi ] ) and ( [ gamalinear])@xmath108    although this effect is relatively large , there is the problem that both , growing and decreasing modes are always present , so that a wave entering the region with the static magnetic field results in a superposition of both modes , and so the variation of amplitude of the growing mode cancels with that of the decreasing mode at first order in @xmath109 , and the effect is only observable at second order , much hindering the experiment .",
    "there is however a further possibility .",
    "it was argued inminotti that , in order for the theory to be consistent with the lack of strong gravitational effects due to the magnetic field of the earth , the non - linear terms in eqs .",
    "( [ phi ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) should come into play . in this way , for the case of a static magnetic field outside its sources one can write @xmath110 , with @xmath111 , so that equations ( [ phi ] ) and ( [ psi ] ) for the static case are@xmath112which have the exact solutions @xmath113 , so that @xmath114 , thus largely  reducing the source of the gravitational force .",
    "this solution for the case of the earth s magnetic field is compatible with the proposal in@xcite , in which the solution with @xmath115 was used , if @xmath116 with these considerations , the field @xmath88 is simply given by@xmath117with @xmath118 . in this case",
    "the system ( [ full ] ) can be written as ( with @xmath63)@xmath119where the term with @xmath120 can be neglected as it is small , since from ( [ full ] ) one can estimate that @xmath121with @xmath90 a characteristic length of field variation .",
    "proceeding as before one has@xmath122    for propagation perpendicular to @xmath61 one has@xmath123where",
    "@xmath124 is the angle between @xmath61 and @xmath125 . as a result",
    "the dispersion relation is that of a normal em wave , @xmath126 , and the only anomalous effect is the presence of a small longitudinal component of the electric field .    in the case of propagation",
    "along @xmath61 one has@xmath127so that @xmath128 , and @xmath83 , with@xmath129    this effect is similar in magnitude to that in ( [ gamalinear ] ) , but with the advantage that only one sign is possible , so that there are not coexisting growing and decaying modes , and the growth ( or decay ) could be observed at first order .",
    "due to the relevance of first order effects in the propagation of em waves , it seems plausible that the use of simple and readily available nowadays fiber optics would allow the verification of the theoretical results of the previous section .",
    "especially , the last result of subsection 2.3 shows a direct method for measuring the additional amplitude change caused by the propagation of a single mode inside an ordinary polymer fiber .",
    "given the significance of separating between alternative extentions of general relativistic theories for modern cosmology we propose that such an experiment is of great importance due to its simplicity .",
    "specifically , our proposal is to get a sufficiently large fiber appropriately coiled which , with existing materials , can be made to easily reach a km of total distance for the propagating mode . by taking the logarithm of eq ( [ deltaa ] ) as @xmath130 , for the amplitude variation to be in db units , we see that a magnetic field of 2 t would result in an amplitude variation of 1 db in 1 km distance .",
    "it is possible to reduce such a distance by an order of magnitude only through a large magnetic field of about 10 t or more which can be produced in current nmr devices while use of superconducting elements could reach even higher values .",
    "actually , recent reports from the nhmfl at los alamos claim a 100 t machine is already operational @xcite .",
    "at the moment we will only assume the strongest existing rare earth magnets like boron - neodymium for a tabletop experiment where sufficiently high accuracy power meters are available .",
    "the central idea is to detect the difference between measurement on the fiber coil , with and without the b field .",
    "present day power meters have an accuracy noise threshold of about @xmath131 db . fortunately , existing manufacturers may be able to provide bobbins totalling 25 km of fiber or more so that a measurement of 10 - 20 db of additional amplitude variations is in principle possible .",
    "proposed configuration of the optical fiber and helmholtz coils.,scaledwidth=100.0% ]    with respect to the fiber coiling process , one has to take into account that any angles introduced to the fiber material introduce additional attenuation to any propagating mode .",
    "technical data for existing fiber materials suggest that there should be a certain curvature with angles small enough not to cause severe damping during normal propagation .",
    "this can be achieved with a flattened coil frame like the one shown in fig.[fig1 ] .",
    "as we are not interested in all the engineering details of an actual experiment we only emphasize the main points where care must be taken using some simplified configurations . in the flattened fiber coil of fig.[fig1 ]",
    "care must be taken so that on the upper path the fiber is parallel to the direction of the external magnetic field .",
    "the return path , though , must be outside the region of influence or else the amplitude variation effect will be cancelled and no difference will be measured .",
    "for this reason we also made the flattened electromagnets shown in such a way that the homogenized flux of the applied b field will only affect the upper part of the fiber s path .",
    "it is also possible to make up an homogeneous magnetic field using neodymium magnets in a special configuration known as a cylindrical `` halbach array '' @xcite .",
    "such arrays have been in use for a long time in magnetic trains , very fast brushless motors and similar electrical engineering applications .",
    "in such a case , the upper or lower part of the flattened fiber coil should be put inside the region of homogeneous b flux of a halbach cylinder .",
    "we have here reported for the first time some new results on the possible gravitational influence on classical em fields in scalar - tensor extentions of general relativity .",
    "we also used the linearized version of the perturbed maxwell equations to analyse the propagation of ordinary modes .",
    "the analysis led us to conclude the possibility of easy , low cost experiments with fiber optics that would allow the verification of the said theories .",
    "we believe that the present state of cosmology with the recurring acute problems of inflation and initial conditions , the cmb anisotropy as well as the dark matter and dark energy , fully justifies the continuation of the present research in more areas where evidence can be accumulated experimentally ."
