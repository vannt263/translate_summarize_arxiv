    "life is full of risky decisions , from the humdrum to matters of life or death . understanding the drivers and the underlying processes of risky decisions is important in many disciplines including behavioural ecology .",
    "@xcite revolutionized foraging research by introducing risk sensitivity . the risk - sensitive foraging theory formulated in terms of the energy budget rule",
    "@xcite has been influential not only in behavioural ecology @xcite , but also other disciplines such as psychology , economics , and anthropology @xcite .",
    "the budget rule predicts that , given a constant feeding option and a variable option of equal mean , an animal should choose the constant option if the expected energy budget is higher than the threshold required for overnight survival ( i.e.the daily energy requirement ) and the variable one if the expected budget is lower than the threshold ; i.e.risk aversion on positive energy budgets and risk proneness on negative budgets @xcite .",
    "the budget rule is logically appealing : it has an analytic derivation , assuming that animals will behave to maximise the probability of avoiding starvation  @xcite .",
    "the budget rule has also been empirically supported  @xcite .      in spite of the early successes and its significant influence , the budget rule has recently been challenged , both empirically and theoretically . @xcite and  @xcite review the published empirical studies related to the budget rule and",
    "conclude that experimental support is weak .",
    "one caveat to this conclusion is that experiments yielding negative results against the budget rule tend to involve larger species than those yielding positive results @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0-score model which the budget rule is formally derived from assumes a small bird foraging in order to meet daily energetic requirement in winter @xcite , which is less critical for large species @xcite .",
    "thus , any application of the budget rule to large species is less suitable since the short - term energetic requirement does not impose a significant threat to survival unlike small species @xcite .",
    "more realistic models of risk sensitivity have been developed @xcite , though one of the main drawbacks with these models is that their predictions are less testable due to the increased complexity @xcite .",
    "@xcite assert that risk sensitivity does not have adaptive value by itself and it is a side - effect caused by psychophysical features of animal information processing systems .",
    "scalar utility theory is proposed , based on weber s law that relates the perceived difference between stimuli to the mean value of the stimuli  @xcite . however , scalar utility theory predicts preference of risk aversion alone ( when variability is in the amount of food ) whereas there are empirical findings that report preference of risk proneness , which can not be ignored .",
    "more importantly , the mechanistic ( proximate ) explanation based on the psychophysical features does not need to deny the functional ( ultimate ) explanations since they are complementary rather than competing alternatives . based on a meta - analysis of the same studies listed in  @xcite as well as more recent ones , for instance ,  @xcite draws a conclusion different from that of  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "while applying weber s law as well ,  @xcite presents regression - based results that accommodate both risk aversion and risk proneness to be compatible with the budget rule , which integrates the functional and mechanistic explanations ; the direction of preference is determined by functional considerations ( the budget rule ) and the strength of preference by perceptual considerations ( weber s law ) . rather than exclusively deducing either risk sensitivity or risk indifference per study",
    ", @xcite examines the ` degree ' of risk sensitivity from a perceptual perspective and shows that there is a gradient of responses to risk .    in this paper",
    ", we present a gradual view of risk sensitivity from a normative perspective and provide a gradual version of the budget rule , which not only explains the empirically observed gradual nature of risk sensitivity , but also can explain observations counted against the budget rule .",
    "we review the formal derivation of the budget rule from the @xmath0-score model @xcite and point out what it overlooks .",
    "the @xmath0-score model assumes a small bird foraging in winter to survive a night during which it can not forage .",
    "we adopt notations similar to those of  @xcite .",
    "the bird s energy reserve @xmath1 at dusk is assumed to be normally distributed with mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 .",
    "it is also assumed that the bird has behavioural control over @xmath2 and @xmath4 , having to meet a fixed daily energetic requirement @xmath5 to survive the night .",
    "fitness is proportional to short - term survivorship which is represented by a step function in the @xmath0-score model , yielding the expected fitness to be proportional to the survival probability @xmath6 .",
    "the model seeks to maximise the survival probability @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a @xmath0-score and @xmath9 is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution @xmath10 with zero mean and unit variance . to maximise @xmath6 for a given @xmath2 , one needs to check its first derivative @xmath11 where @xmath12 .",
    "note that the sign of @xmath13 is entirely determined by that of @xmath14 in the sense that @xmath15 always holds ; if @xmath0 decreases , then survival probability @xmath6 increases and vice versa .",
    "the analytical derivation of the budget rule then entirely focuses on the sign of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "given a constant mean and different variances , it yields the effect of @xmath4 on @xmath0 as follows ; @xmath16 on positive budgets @xmath17 , the standard deviation @xmath4 should be reduced to decrease @xmath0 . on negative budgets @xmath18 , @xmath4",
    "should be increased to decrease @xmath0 .",
    "this yields the extreme variance rule , predicting that the smallest variance possible is the optimal behaviour to be chosen on positive budgets and the largest variance possible on negative budgets @xcite .",
    "the budget rule is a special case of the extreme variance rule with the smallest variance being zero , predicting the optimal risk sensitivity of risk aversion on positive budgets and risk proneness on negative budgets .    a caveat of this and its standard interpretation is an all - or - nothing view on animal decision - making , focusing mainly on optimal behaviour .",
    "according to this all - or - nothing view , if an animal s response to variability does not comply with the optimal risk sensitivity ( in a statistically significant sense ) , it is counted against the budget rule @xcite .",
    "however , comparison of observed and predicted behaviours is not sufficient for testing a behavioural theory and one should not reject the theory without comparing the fitness of them @xcite . not all of the observations different from the prediction should be treated the same .",
    "if the difference in fitness between observed and predicted behaviours is insignificant , for instance , one should not use the observation to reject the theory .",
    "the degree of risk sensitivity under different experimental conditions is thus more informative than merely testing whether the response to risk complies with the prediction of the budget rule ; according to the meta - analysis of the same empirical studies listed in  @xcite , animals indeed show a gradient of responses to risk , the degree of risk sensitivity forming a continuum @xcite .",
    "while the conclusion of @xcite is based on different groups of subjects under different energy budgets , the gradual nature of risk - sensitive responses within the same individuals is also observed @xcite .",
    "thus , a more gradual view of the budget rule needs to be sought .",
    "another caveat of the derivation is the @xmath0-score centric view . since the @xmath0-score has an unlimited range of @xmath19 whereas the survival probability has a limited range of @xmath20 with a one - to - one correspondence between @xmath0 and @xmath21 , a large change in @xmath0 can yield little change in @xmath21 .",
    "if foraging options significantly differ in @xmath0 , a @xmath0-score centric view can misleadingly imply a strong risk sensitivity whereas there is actually a weak risk sensitivity or a risk indifference due to little difference in corresponding survival probability @xmath21 .",
    "there already exists a theoretical consideration on a gradual nature of risk sensitivity .",
    "@xcite formulated decreasing risk aversion of the @xmath0-score model based on the marginal rate of substitution @xcite , @xmath22 a caveat of this analysis is that the gradual nature of risk sensitivity is considered only along an indifference curve of a constant @xmath0-score equivalent to a constant survival probability ; the analysis varies mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 such that a constant @xmath0-score is maintained . this is less compatible with the standard design of risk sensitivity experiments that offer a choice between a variable ( @xmath23 ) and a constant ( @xmath24 ) feeding option with the same mean , yielding the options to differ in @xmath0-score .    the arrow - pratt measure popular in economics  @xcite @xmath25 is often used as a risk aversion measure where @xmath26 is a utility ( or fitness ) function @xcite .",
    "decreasing risk aversion is indicated by @xmath27 .",
    "a caveat is that it is a local measure .",
    "it only informs of the response to risk at a single point along the fitness function whereas risk sensitivity deals with problems that require more than information at a single point to predict preference , probability distributions spreading likelihood over many possible amounts @xcite .",
    "moreover , the arrow - pratt measure for the @xmath0-score model is not well defined since @xmath28 due to the fitness function @xmath26 being a step function ( i.e.piece-wise constant ) .",
    "these caveats of the existing measures call for an alternative measure of gradual nature of risk sensitivity , which should satisfy the following requirements :    1",
    ".   it should reflect risk sensitivity in a choice between a variable and a constant feeding option with the same mean .",
    "2 .   it should take into consideration the whole distribution of reserve rather than a single value of it .",
    "we propose a measure of risk sensitivity from a normative perspective @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the expected fitness of a feeding option with mean @xmath2 and variance @xmath3 , and @xmath31 is the maximum possible difference in @xmath32 .",
    "it satisfies the aforementioned two requirements .",
    "it takes into consideration the whole distribution of reserve @xmath1 at dusk in the sense that rather than fitness @xmath26 at a single value @xmath1 , it uses expected fitness @xmath33 obtained by averaging or integrating @xmath26 with the normal distribution @xmath34 of reserve @xmath1 .",
    "it also reflects a choice between a variable and a constant feeding option with the same mean since it involves the expected fitness @xmath30 of the variable option and @xmath35 of the constant option .",
    "the reason why animals should show risk sensitivity in a normative sense is a consequence in expected fitness , which is well reflected in the proposed measure @xmath36 of risk sensitivity ; the greater difference in expected fitness @xmath37 between the options , the greater sensitivity of risk should animals show . for instance , the greater is the expected fitness @xmath30 of the variable option than @xmath35 of the constant option ( i.e.the greater is @xmath36 ) , the greater is selection pressure for preferring the variable option ( i.e.the greater is risk proneness ) .",
    "note that the proposed measure @xmath36 is invariant under an affine transformation of the expected fitness @xmath32 .",
    "in other words , even if @xmath32 is transformed into @xmath38 via scaling by @xmath39 and offsetting by @xmath40 , the risk sensitivity measured by @xmath36 remains the same , @xmath41 .",
    "this affine - invariance of @xmath36 is due to the division by @xmath31 and the subtraction @xmath37 .",
    "one of the reasons why the arrow - pratt measure involves the division by @xmath42 is to maintain the affine - invariance .",
    "the affine - invariance of @xmath36 is important ; for instance , the animal s internal representation may not use expected fitness @xmath32 directly , but its affine transformation @xmath43 .",
    "since the expected fitness in the @xmath0-score model is proportional to the survival probability @xmath6 and @xmath44 , we have @xmath45 due to the affine - invariance ; note that the maximum possible difference in @xmath6 is @xmath44 since probability @xmath6 ranges from 0 to 1 . the difference in survival probability @xmath46 between a variable and a constant foraging option with the same mean @xmath2 thus serves as a measure of risk sensitivity that an animal should show due to a consequence in expected fitness .",
    "the sign of @xmath47 can discriminate between risk aversion and risk proneness .",
    "@xmath48 implies selection for risk aversion since the survival probability of the constant option @xmath49 is higher than that of the variable option @xmath50 whereas @xmath51 implies selection for risk proneness .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath52 indicates strength of selection for risk sensitivity ; the larger @xmath53 , the stronger selection pressure for risk sensitivity . for instance , the larger is @xmath53 while @xmath48 , the stronger is the selection pressure for risk aversion ; thus , the more frequent choice of the constant option over the variable one .      with the measure of risk sensitivity",
    "@xmath54 , we now derive the gradual nature of risk sensitivity from the @xmath0-score model .",
    "we are particularly interested in the degree of risk sensitivity with respect to the energy budget . in other words , for a given variable option @xmath4 ( and the other option being a constant one ) , how does the degree of risk sensitivity vary as mean reserve @xmath2 varies ?",
    "for this , we need to compute @xmath55 that is the rate of change in ( the magnitude of ) risk sensitivity @xmath56 as @xmath2 increases for a given @xmath4 . especially , the sign of @xmath55 is useful ; @xmath57 indicates decreasing risk sensitivity whereas @xmath58 , increasing risk sensitivity .    on positive budgets @xmath59 , we have @xmath60  ( i.e. risk aversion ) since the constant option guarantees the survival ( i.e.@xmath61 ) whereas the variable one can not ( i.e.@xmath62 ) . since @xmath63",
    ", we have @xmath64 . for a given @xmath4 , we have @xmath65 note that @xmath66 always holds for @xmath67 and thus @xmath57 . in other words ,",
    "the strength of selection for risk aversion or the degree of risk aversion @xmath68 decreases as @xmath2 increases on positive budgets for a given @xmath4 .",
    "moreover , we have @xmath69 as @xmath2 increases for a given @xmath4 since @xmath70 and @xmath71 as @xmath72 .",
    "in other words , the survival is almost guaranteed even if the variable option is chosen as long as the reserve mean is high enough .",
    "hence , we have @xmath73 as @xmath2 increases for a given @xmath4 ; i.e.there is little difference in the survival probability between the feeding options if the reserve mean is high enough .",
    "the conclusion is that on positive budgets , the strength of selection for risk aversion monotonically decreases and can diminish as the reserve mean increases for a given variance .",
    "this gradual and diminishing nature of risk aversion can be intuitively understood as well ; see fig.[fig_risk_sensitivity ] .",
    "on negative budgets , by a similar argument , the strength of selection for risk proneness monotonically decreases and can diminish as the mean decreases for a given variance ; see fig.[fig_iso_prob ] .",
    "in other words , the degree of optimal risk sensitivity predicted by the conventional budget rule gradually changes .",
    "being purely based on an adaptive rationale , this ` gradual ' view of the @xmath0-score model ( or the gradual budget rule hereafter ) predicts that the conventional budget rule holds if the difference in expected fitness ( or survival probability ) between the feeding options is significant ( e.g.when the reserve mean is close to starvation threshold for a given deviation ) and may not do so otherwise , risk sensitivity gradually weakening .",
    "the gradual budget rule not only encompasses the conventional budget rule as a special case of it , but also may explain empirical results that are often counted against the conventional budget rule and the adaptive rationale of risk sensitivity behind it .          the empirical findings that report risk indifference or weak risk sensitivity used to be counted against the conventional budget rule @xcite . according to the gradual budget rule , however , if the difference in expected fitness between the feeding options is insignificant , risk indifference is feasible in the sense that there is weak selection for the optimal risk sensitivity predicted by the conventional budget rule and , thus , weak selection against risk indifference .",
    "note that weak selection for the optimal risk sensitivity does not imply strong selection for risk indifference , the latter of which would predict only risk indifference .",
    "instead , it implies weak selection against suboptimal risk sensitivity as well as risk indifference in the sense that there is little difference in expected fitness between the optimal and the suboptimal risk sensitivity .",
    "in other words , risk aversion , risk proneness and risk indifference are all feasible under the condition of weak selection , which may explain empirically observed risk indifference and suboptimal risk sensitivity such as risk proneness on positive budgets and risk aversion on negative budgets .",
    "thus , one should not simply conclude that any observation apparently contradicting the optimal risk sensitivity challenges the conventional budget rule and the adaptive rationale of risk sensitivity behind it .",
    "instead , one should take into consideration the expected fitness of the observation and that of the optimal risk sensitivity .",
    "other than the argument of weak selection , can we provide additional explanations why risk sensitivity ( especially , suboptimal risk sensitivity such as risk proneness on positive budgets and risk aversion on negative budgets ) rather than risk indifference can be empirically observed in a statistically significant sense ?",
    "any model is an approximation or simplification of the reality , leaving out many features .",
    "the @xmath0-score model that the budget rule is formally derived from incorporates the survival , but leaves out other functional and mechanistic features such as reproduction and perception . under the condition of weak selection for the optimal risk sensitivity ( e.g.the reserve mean is distant enough from the survival threshold for a given variance ) , any of risk proneness ,",
    "risk aversion and risk indifference is feasible from the gradual view of the @xmath0-score model .",
    "however , only one of them may be feasible from the perspective of a feature that the @xmath0-score model leaves out , say , reproduction ; e.g.only risk proneness may yield expected fitness substantially higher than that of any other alternatives in terms of reproduction .",
    "we elaborate this aspect .",
    "being built upon the @xmath0-score model , the twin threshold model seeks to maximise the combined probability @xmath74 of surviving the night and succeeding in reproduction @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is reproduction threshold , @xmath77 and @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "whereas the original twin threshold model uses combination weights @xmath79 and 1 , we use the convex combination of the two probabilities with @xmath79 and @xmath80 to ensure that the combination @xmath81 remains a probability . with starvation threshold @xmath5 and reproduction threshold @xmath76 ,",
    "their associated residual or difference in probability @xmath82 is qualitatively different from the residual @xmath83 associated with a single threshold @xmath5 ; see fig.[fig_twin ] . as empirically observed from some species ,",
    "the twin threshold model predicts risk proneness on positive budgets ( i.e.@xmath84 being significant ) in a range of parameters @xmath85 where reserve mean @xmath2 is close to but lower than reproduction threshold @xmath76 .",
    "this makes sense since risk proneness offers a possibility of reproduction whereas risk aversion does not . in the same range of parameters ,",
    "the gradual budget rule can yield weak selection pressure for the optimal risk sensitivity predicted by the conventional budget rule ( i.e.@xmath47 being insignificant ) and so predicts that any of risk proneness , risk aversion or risk indifference is feasible , there being little difference in expected fitness between them .",
    "near at @xmath86 , for instance , we have @xmath87 whereas @xmath88 in fig.[fig_twin ] . rather than conflicted predictions",
    ", the inclusion of reproduction feature refines the predictions based on only survival feature in the sense that the latter predicts any of risk proneness , risk aversion or risk indifference to be feasible and the first predicts only one of them ( i.e.risk proneness ) to be feasible . note that they make similar predictions when both of the models are under conditions of strong selection , i.e.near starvation threshold @xmath5 .",
    "as reserve mean @xmath2 is lowered and becomes close to starvation threshold @xmath5 on positive budgets for a given variance @xmath3 , for instance , selection pressure for risk proneness to succeed in reproduction weakens whereas selection pressure for risk aversion to survive the night strengthens and , thus , the gradual view of the twin threshold model predicts risk aversion as the gradual view of the @xmath0-score model does .",
    "near at @xmath89 , for instance , we have @xmath90 and @xmath91 in fig.[fig_twin ] , both yielding strong selection pressure for risk aversion .",
    "another feature that the @xmath0-score model leaves out is the possibility of starvation ( to death ) during foraging , which can explain risk aversion on negative budgets .",
    "a forager ( e.g. a small bird ) may have to ensure it stays above a lethal boundary of reserves during foraging as well , which is lower than the overnight starvation threshold @xmath5 .",
    "there are models that take into consideration both possibilities of starvation during foraging and night , yielding a prediction different from that of the @xmath0-score model .",
    "for instance , the lazy-_l _ model predicts risk aversion on negative budgets if the requirement to avoid the lethal boundary is a lot stronger than the requirement to survive the night .",
    "this is especially so when there is enough time left for foraging until dusk and reserves are dangerously low .",
    "as dusk approaches , however , the requirement to survive the night strengthens whereas the effect of the lethal boundary weakens , which makes the lazy-_l _ model become more equivalent to the @xmath0-score model  @xcite ; increasing risk proneness on negative budgets is thus predicted by both models as reserve mean increases .    in summary ,",
    "additional features that the @xmath0-score model leaves out can refine predictions made by the gradual budget rule under conditions of weak selection , which may explain risk proneness on positive budgets and risk aversion on negative budgets , contrary to the predictions of the conventional budget rule .",
    "we derived the gradual budget rule that normatively reflects the gradual nature of risk sensitivity and encompasses the conventional budget rule as a special case .",
    "the gradual budget rule better fits the empirical findings including those that used to challenge the conventional budget rule .",
    "the proposed measure of gradual risk sensitivity @xmath92 is only applicable to a choice between a variable ( @xmath23 ) and a constant feeding option ( @xmath24 ) with the same mean @xmath2 .",
    "we can relax some of the conditions on @xmath36 and generalise it for a wider range of choices . instead of insisting on one of the feeding options to be a constant one",
    ", we may consider that both options are variable and we then have @xmath93 .",
    "note that @xmath36 is a special case of @xmath94 with @xmath95 .",
    "we may further relax the condition that both options should have the same mean @xmath2 and we then have @xmath96 . note that @xmath94 is a special case of @xmath97 with @xmath98 while @xmath36 is a special case with @xmath98 and @xmath95 . in the remaining part of this section , we critically compare and discuss other relevant work .",
    "a metric relevant to the gradual risk sensitivity is the canonical cost of a suboptimal behaviour @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the expected fitness for the optimal behaviour and @xmath32 for a suboptimal behaviour @xcite .",
    "a caveat of this metric is that it is not affine - invariant .",
    "for instance , the expected fitness scaled by @xmath101 fails the invariance , i.e.@xmath102 ; rather than expected fitness itself ( i.e.the expected number of offspring surviving to adulthood ) , note that a scaled expected fitness is often used @xcite . as a function of the canonical cost @xmath103 , the probability of choosing a suboptimal behaviour can be derived , assuming that the perception of expected fitness @xmath32 is subject to error @xcite .",
    "when an animal makes a choice between two simultaneously available options , one has @xmath104 for the probability of a suboptimal option and @xmath105 for the optimal option where @xmath106 is a positive free parameter @xcite .",
    "it yields @xmath107 when @xmath108 , predicting only risk indifference when there is little difference in expected fitness between the optimal and a suboptimal behaviour in the context of risk sensitivity .",
    "contrary to this prediction , however , risk proneness and risk aversion should be feasible as well as risk indifference in the sense that selection against all of them is weak when @xmath108 .",
    "another relevant metric is @xmath109 where @xmath32 is the expected fitness of an observed ( suboptimal ) behaviour and @xmath100 is the expected fitness for the predicted ( optimal ) behaviour @xcite ; in the context of risk sensitivity , we have @xmath110 and @xmath111 on negative budgets and vice versa on positive budgets . a caveat of this metric",
    "is that it is not affine - invariant .",
    "for instance , the expected fitness offset by @xmath112 fails the invariance , i.e.@xmath113 .",
    "another caveat is that it can not capture the gradual nature of risk sensitivity on negative budgets since we have @xmath114 regardless of @xmath115 .",
    "this contrasts the case on positive budgets where @xmath116 gradually increases to 1 as mean @xmath2 increases for a given variance @xmath3 .",
    "not viewing risk sensitivity as having adaptive value per se ,  @xcite instead assert that it is caused as a side - effect of perception and proposes sut ( scalar utility theory ) as an alternative to the conventional budget rule  @xcite .",
    "sut consists of two parts , modelling the animal s knowledge of the food amounts and postulating a decision process . among feeding options with the same mean but different variances , the memory representation of the option with smaller variance has larger skew - sensitive measures ( e.g.mode and median ) as a consequence of weber s law .",
    "if the animal s decision process uses the mode or other skew - sensitive measures in comparing ( the memory representations of ) the feeding options , it is argued that the animal will prefer the constant option since it provides an ` apparently ' larger amount of food than the variable option does , yielding risk aversion ; see fig.[fig_sut]a . predicting only risk aversion regardless of energy budgets",
    ", however , this side - effect assertion of sut suffers from numerous caveats from both empirical and theoretical perspectives .          as the empirical evidence supporting sut , @xcite",
    "refer to a set of 22 studies reviewed in  @xcite , the majority of which report ( consistent ) risk aversion .",
    "however , those studies do not manipulate the energy budgets of the subjects .",
    "since the energy budgets are not manipulated , the conventional budget rule can not be fully tested nor fairly compared using these studies .",
    "risk aversion reported from the studies without budget manipulation does not exclusively support sut in the sense that risk aversion is also predicted by the conventional budget rule when the animals are on positive budgets . even from a perspective of the conventional budget rule",
    ", it is already understood that risk aversion occurs more often than risk proneness because the positive budgets are commonly realised levels of energy budgets @xcite .",
    "the 35 studies reviewed in  @xcite are better suited to fairly test both sut and the conventional budget rule using the same data set since these studies manipulated energy budgets ; additional benefits include a larger number of studies as well as an inclusion of more recent studies . among the 35 studies ,",
    "8 report consistent risk aversion ( as predicted by sut ) , 11 of ` some amount ' of risk aversion , and 16 of ` no ' risk aversion .",
    "only 8/35 support sut , which is even lower than 10/35 of supporting the conventional budget rule . empirical support of sut is weaker than that of the conventional budget rule .",
    "animals are assumed to prefer larger amounts of food @xcite .",
    "depending on the statistics of the memory representation used for assessing food amounts , however , the hypothetical decision process would yield a different choice among feeding options with the same mean and different variances . if the mean of the memory representation is assumed to be used , it yields no bias to variability of food amounts ( i.e.risk indifference ) since the animal would ` perceive ' the food amounts of the options to be the same .",
    "if the maximum is used , it yields bias in favour of variability ( i.e.risk proneness ) since the animal would perceive the amount of the variable option to be greater ; its positively skewed memory representation leads to the maximum greater than that of the symmetric distribution of the constant option .",
    "if the mode or median is used , it yields bias against variability ( i.e.risk aversion ) since the animal would perceive the amounts of the constant option to be greater .",
    "what is the rationale or justification of sut s assumption that the animal s decision process would use the mode ( or any other skew - sensitive statistic ) of the memory representations rather than an alternative statistic such as the mean or maximum ? if the mode is used in choice process , it would fit to the empirical data of animals bias against variability of food amounts whereas either the mean or maximum would not @xcite .",
    "this is hardly an ` explanation ' of the empirically observed bias , but seems to be no better than a ` description ' of it , merely fitting to the data .",
    "if the empirical data showed no bias related to variability , according to the logic of sut , one would simply assume the decision process used the mean since it would better fit to the data than other statistics would .",
    "if the data showed a bias in favour of variability , one would just assume to use the maximum or any other statistic that would yield the bias , according to the fitting - to - data logic of sut .",
    "another caveat of the usage of the mode or any other skew - sensitive statistic is the functional problem of preferring an option of lower fitness .",
    "unlike other relevant theories in biology , psychology and economics , sut assumes fitness ( or utility ) as a ` linear ' function of food amounts @xcite .",
    "it is well known that , under the linear relations , only the mean of food amounts has an effect on the mean of fitness ( i.e.expected fitness ) , but variance or any other variability - sensitive statistic does not @xcite . in any theory that assumes a linear fitness function as sut does ,",
    "the animal s decision process is thus expected to use and compare the mean of food amounts ( i.e. preferring a feeding option of higher mean ) .",
    "however , sut assumes that the decision process uses a skew - sensitive statistic such as the mode ( i.e. preferring an option of higher mode ) .",
    "this is not a merely logical issue , but has a serious fitness consequence as well .",
    "if the decision process is based on a skew - sensitive statistic ( e.g.mode ) as assumed by sut , it can yield an erroneous preference of an option whose expected fitness is lower than that of the alternative . even though the mean amount of a variable feeding option is higher than that of a constant one ( and thus the expected fitness of the first is higher than that of the latter ) , for example , the animal that makes a choice based on the mode will prefer the constant one ( of the lower expected fitness ) if the mode of the variable one is lower than that of the constant one due to the right - skew of the memory representation of the variable one ; see fig.[fig_sut]b .",
    "note that this problematic preference of lower fitness is admitted for an earlier version of sut based on a single sampling of memory representation .",
    "however , the problem persists with the later versions of sut based on a skew - sensitive statistic ; any decision process that is based on a statistic other than the mean yields the problematic preference although the conditions where the problem occurs may differ , depending on the statistic .",
    "there should be natural selection against the erroneous decision process that uses a skew - sensitive statistic .",
    "for sut to be a genuinely mechanistic model predicting risk aversion , it should justify the usage of the mode ( or any skew - sensitive statistic such as the median or even the single sampling ) on mechanistic grounds rather than merely assuming it .",
    "for instance , suppose that ( an algorithm or neural mechanism of ) computation of the mode of a distribution is significantly simpler than that of the mean such that it would even compensate the negative consequence due to the mode - based choice , then it would make a good case for using the mode . to our knowledge ,",
    "unfortunately , sut seems to lack of any related attempts @xcite .    in summary , even though weber s law as a universal principle of psychophysics is empirically well supported , it merely supports one component of sut , i.e.a weberian memory representation of food amounts @xcite .",
    "however , it has little to do with supporting the key component of sut , i.e.the hypothetical decision process based on skew - sensitive statistics to yield only risk aversion , which suffers from numerous caveats .",
    "contrary to sut that predicts only risk aversion , one can accommodate both risk aversion and risk proneness to be compatible with the conventional budget rule even though weber s law is applied @xcite .",
    "while revealing a gradual nature of risk sensitivity from a meta - analysis based on regressions , @xcite concludes that the direction of preference is determined by functional considerations ( complying with the conventional budget rule ) and the strength of preference by perceptual considerations ( complying with weber s law ) . when risk aversion is predicted by the conventional budget rule , for instance",
    ", the regression coefficient is positive , indicating that an increase in relative variability yields stronger risk aversion .",
    "according to weber s law , relative variability or the coefficient of variation cv@xmath117 correlates with capability of perceptual discrimination between a variable and a constant feeding option .",
    "thus , the stronger risk aversion or the increasing preference of a constant option on positive budgets with increasing cv of the variable feeding option is explained by perceptual considerations in the sense that perceptual discrimination of a constant option ( i.e.the optimal choice ) from a variable one ( i.e.the suboptimal choice ) improves as the difference in cv between the options increases @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is argued that the functional considerations based on the conventional budget rule are unable to predict this changing level of risk sensitivity between experimental conditions @xcite . according to the gradual budget rule , however",
    ", even the strength of preference can be explained by functional considerations as well . for a given standard deviation @xmath23 ,",
    "as mean @xmath2 decreases on positive budgets , the difference in expected fitness between the feeding options increases ( i.e.selection pressure for risk aversion strengthens ) while the difference in cv increases as well since cv@xmath117 negatively correlates with mean @xmath2 .",
    "a positive correlation between strength of risk aversion and cv thus stems from functional considerations ( complying with the gradual budget rule ) as well .      while the aforementioned meta - analysis supports the gradual budget rule , it is based on different groups of subjects under different energy budgets . to empirically test the gradual budget rule within the same individuals",
    ", one needs to involve a wide range of parameters . instead of a single or a limited range of reserve mean on positive budgets , for instance , a wider range should be tested out since the gradual budget rule not only predicts a richer set of risk sensitivity than the conventional budget rule does , but also complies with the latter , depending on the reserve mean .",
    "for example , hummingbirds not only become more risk - averse on positive budgets as the reserve mean gets closer to the survival threshold , but also show more risk proneness on positive budgets when the reserve mean gets further away from the threshold @xcite .",
    "european starlings become more risk - averse on positive budgets as ambient temperature decreases , the latter of which is equivalent to raising the survival threshold , yielding a reserve mean closer to it @xcite .",
    "we proposed the gradual budget rule , which normatively reflects the gradual nature of risk sensitivity and encompasses the energy budget rule as a special case .",
    "the gradual budget rule predicts significant selection pressure for the risk sensitivity complying with the energy budget rule in a limited range of parameters and less significant pressure in the remaining range , the latter of which can allow for behaviours not complying with the energy budget rule and explains some of the empirical findings that used to be counted against the energy budget rule as well as the adaptive value of risk sensitivity .",
