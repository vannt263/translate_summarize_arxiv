    "this paper aims to establish the distribution of projected rotational velocities ( @xmath2sin@xmath3 ) for a sample of early b - type stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "i explore the effects of the parameters age and metallicity on the observed distribution of rotational velocities .",
    "the motivation for this study arises from recent stellar evolutionary models that incorporate stellar rotation .",
    "this modeling shows that the rotational history is vital to the interpretation of the evolutionary phase and elemental abundances seen in massive stars .",
    "heger , langer & woosley ( 2000 ) and meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) show that axial rotation can bring about in a natural way the degree of extension to the convective core in massive stars as discerned from cluster h - r diagrams ( e.g.  keller et al",
    ".  2000 , 2001a ) and the mass - luminosity relation of cepheids ( keller & wood 2002 ) .",
    "models incorporating rotation also predict mixing of internally processed material to the surface during main - sequence ( ms ) evolution ( the faster the initial rotation the greater the degree of mixing ) .",
    "standard evolution models ( e.g. bressan et al . 1993 ) , on the other hand , do not . in the magellanic clouds ( mcs )",
    ", nitrogen has been shown to be over - abundant in many supergiants of spectral types b to k ( e.g. venn 1999 ; lennon et al .",
    "1996 ) and numerous ms b stars ( rolleston et al .  1996 ; korn et al .  2000 ; korn et al .",
    "2002 ) which is indicative of mixing of cno cycled material .",
    "the dispersion in n abundance is significantly larger than that seen in the galaxy ( mc erlean et al .",
    "1999 ; venn 1995 ; gies & lambert 1992 ) .",
    "this has been tentatively attributed to the presence of a greater number of rapid rotators within the lower metallicity environs of the mcs .    at present , direct observational studies of the dependence of stellar rotation on metallicity",
    "are limited .",
    "within the galaxy the work of burki & maeder ( 1977 ) examined the variation of mean @xmath2sin@xmath3 of early b stars with galactocentric distance , but the range of the latter was only several kpc which , given the galactic metallicity gradient , is insufficient to draw firm conclusions regarding the role of metallicity .",
    "recent work by royer et al.(2003 ) has revisited this work extending it to a broader sample of galactic clusters with inconclusive results .",
    "indirect observational evidence for more rapid rotation of massive stars in metal - poor sites like the mcs is derived from examination of the population of be stars .",
    "be stars show balmer emission arising from a circumstellar disk of material surrounding a rapidly rotating stellar photosphere .",
    "they form a population with which to trace stellar rotation ( assuming that the onset of the be phenomenon itself is not governed by metallicity but rather the underlying distribution of rotational velocities ) .",
    "maeder et al .",
    "( 1999 ) examine the fraction of be stars ( i.e.  n(be)/n(b)+n(be ) ) against metallicity for a sample of clusters with relevant ages ( 1 - 3@xmath410@xmath5 years , corresponding to the maximum occurrence of be stars ) .",
    "maeder et al .",
    "find a strong anti - correlation between the be fraction and metallicity .",
    "this leads the authors to conclude that rotation rates are higher amongst metal - poor stars .",
    "the role of age in determining the resultant distribution of @xmath2sin@xmath3 was first suggested by abt & hunter ( 1962 ) in their study of the brighter members of the trapezium and pleiades clusters .",
    "this was elaborated upon by wolff et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and guthrie ( 1984 ) in their studies which contrasted the distribution of rotational velocities seen in young clusters , older associations and field stars . the distribution of rotational velocities in the older associations and the field share a high proportion of very slow rotators compared with the young cluster sample .",
    "keller et al .  ( 1999 , 2000 , 2001b ) have used the be star population to explore the age dependence of the distribution of rotational velocities .",
    "we have observed that the be fraction amongst the young cluster population rises towards the luminosity of the ms terminus , whereas in the field it retains a relatively uniform distribution in luminosity .",
    "this difference between cluster and field populations can , we argue ( keller et al .  2001b ) , be brought about from an evolutionary enhancement in the rotational velocity over the later portion of the ms lifetime .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to present direct measurements of the projected rotational velocities for a sample of early b - type ms stars within young cluster and field environments of the lmc , together with analogous galactic data from the literature , to investigate directly the dependence of @xmath2sin@xmath3 on both age and metallicity .",
    "section 2 presents our observations and method for the determination of projected rotational velocities .",
    "section 3.1 compares the distribution of rotational velocities in the cluster and field environments of the galaxy and the lmc .",
    "section 3.2 compares the galactic and lmc cluster populations to explore metallicity effects . finally in section 4",
    "i present a discussion of the physical causation of the observed dependence of the distribution of projected rotational velocities on age and metallicity .",
    "i have defined two sample sets : ( 1 . ) a cluster sample  drawn from the population in the vicinity of three young populous clusters in the lmc , namely , ngc 1818 , ngc 2004 and ngc 2100 .",
    "our targets were selected from the wfpc2-based photometry of keller et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . on the basis of this photometry",
    "i have selected those stars on the ms with @xmath6 .",
    "( 2 . ) a field sample  from the vicinity of ngc 2004 and 1818 .",
    "these regions were selected to form the basis of our sample because of their richness and apparently small differential reddening ( keller , wood & bessell 1998 ) .",
    "medium resolution ( 0.6 / px ) spectra of the sample were obtained using the double - beam spectrograph ( dbs ) on the sso 2.3 m telescope between 4 - 6 march 1999 , 25 - 16 november 1999 and 10 - 12 january 2001 .",
    "the spectra consist of two simultaneously recorded non - overlapping segments : blue ( 3800@xmath74800 ) and red ( 6200@xmath76800 ) .",
    "the observations made use of aperture plates machined to locate the target stars . in general the density of the targets",
    "precluded the use of slits for each object , rather holes of appropriate size for typical seeing at the site ( 2 \" ) were made .",
    "sky correction was latter made through the use of slits at the extremities of the field .",
    "wavelength calibration was made through cuar spectra interleaved with the observations .      to determine the projected rotational velocity , @xmath2sin@xmath3 , i have used a @xmath8 minimisation technique which locates an optimal match between the observed spectrum and rotationally broadened synthetic spectra .",
    "the grid of synthetic profiles of stellar h balmer and hei lines by gonzales delgado & leitherer ( 1999 ) is used .",
    "this grid of models spans 50000@xmath9 t@xmath104000 k and 0.0@xmath11 5.0 . for t@xmath12 k nlte models",
    "are used to compute the synthetic spectra , for cooler stars , kurucz lte models are used .    to create the rotationally broadened spectra the synthetic spectra were first convolved with the instrumental response function and then with a broadening function which is based upon that of gray ( 1976 ) : model stellar surface is divided into 40 segments and the emergent doppler - shifted intensity from each is calculated .",
    "this is then integrated to yield the flux at each wavelength .",
    "this approach assumes that the resultant line profile is independent of viewing angle .",
    "physically , the surface gravity ( and hence temperature ) of a rotating star varies with latitude as a result of gravity darkening ( von zeipel 1924 ) . as a consequence the contribution of the rapidly rotating cooler equatorial regions to the observed spectrum is reduced .",
    "townsend et al.(2004 ) present a survey of the behaviour of line width with vsini including viewing angle dependent gravity darkening .",
    "for instance , a star rotating at 95% of the critical velocity (",
    "i.e.  the velocity at which the equatorial escape velocity drops to zero ) seen pole on using the method we apply here leads to an underestimation of @xmath13 by 20% .",
    "the underestimation of @xmath13 is a strong function of @xmath14 such that by @xmath14=300kms@xmath15 for a b2 star this has fallen to a few percent .",
    "the neglect of gravity darkening underlies all rotational velocity standards and previous studies of rotational velocity distributions . for this reason the present work maintains this simplification .",
    "i have used a wavelength range of 3990@xmath16 to 4550@xmath16 for the purposes of finding an optimal match .",
    "the spectra is fit as one contiguous piece .",
    "an optimal solution is sought in @xmath2sin@xmath3 , t@xmath17 , logg parameter space .",
    "the spectra of a series of rotational velocity standards ( slettebak et al .",
    "1975 ) of early to mid b spectral type were obtained .",
    "figure [ compvsini ] shows the comparison between the @xmath2sin@xmath3 determined by means of our parameter fit procedure and that of slettebak et al .",
    "( ibid ) . figure [ stdfitfig ] shows a typical fit to the rotational velocity standards .",
    "figure [ compvsini ] does not show any systematic difference between these results and those of slettebak et al .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) of the spectra of our lmc sample is low , a typical 3hr exposure results in a s / n=30 on a @xmath18=15.5 star .",
    "on the basis of simulations ( discussed below ) i set a lower limit to the s / n of our sample of 20 ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "table [ table1 ] & [ table2 ] reports the @xmath2sin@xmath3 for our sample .",
    "some typical fits are shown in figure [ fitfig ] .",
    "the uncertainties in our estimated @xmath2sin@xmath3 are a function of both s / n and @xmath2sin@xmath3 .",
    "i have carried out a series of trials using model spectra which are rotationally broadened and then degraded to a given s / n .",
    "i have then examined the @xmath2sin@xmath3 returned by our routine from repeated trials .",
    "slow rotators are perturbed by a low s / n .",
    "a s / n of 20 introduces an uncertainty of @xmath2050 kms@xmath15 at a @xmath2sin@xmath3 of 0 kms@xmath15 and systematically returns a higher @xmath2sin@xmath3 .",
    "this overestimation of @xmath2sin@xmath3 at low s / n results primarily from the radial velocity correction which must be made for each star during fitting . at low s",
    "/ n the line - centers of the significant h and he lines are less distinct and an optimal fit may occur with either a slightly higher or lower radial velocity than the underlying systemic radial velocity . a s / n degraded line seen",
    "off - center appears as a broader line and this results in the systematic shift of the slowest rotators to higher @xmath2sin@xmath3 .    as @xmath2sin@xmath3",
    "is increased the importance of this effect diminishes . at @xmath2sin@xmath3=100 kms@xmath15 and s",
    "/ n=20 the uncertainty in @xmath2sin@xmath3 falls to @xmath2025 kms@xmath15 with no significant systematic shift . the uncertainty grows again to @xmath2075 kms@xmath15 at @xmath2sin@xmath3=350 kms@xmath15 ( s / n=20 ) as the line depth is reduced but again with no significant systematic shift .",
    "this behaviour is summarised in figure [ snfig ] . by describing in detail the systematic behaviour of our technique at low s / n it is possible to statistically remove it as described in section 3.2 .",

    "our observations present us with two important conclusions : 1 .",
    "young cluster stars ( b0 - 2 v - iii within 2 mag .  of the ms terminus ) are faster rotators than a similar luminosity range in the field , and 2 .",
    "lmc cluster stars are faster rotators than galactic cluster stars within the same luminosity range at just under a 2@xmath21 significance .    to account , firstly , for the observed difference in rotational velocity between the cluster and field populations i propose a scenario of evolutionary rotational enhancement .",
    "this scenario utilizes the one clear difference between the cluster and field populations , that is , the age spread within each population .",
    "consider a spin - up phase which occurs over an interval of the ms lifetime towards the end of the ms .",
    "the small age spread in the cluster population at the luminosity of the cluster ms terminus places the majority of these stars within the interval of spin - up .",
    "the field population , on the other hand , possesses a more uniform spread of ages at a given luminosity , from the zams to the ms terminus ( this can be confidently said for such rapidly evolving stars ) .",
    "hence in the field we see the time - average of the ms rotational velocity .",
    "the evolution of rotational velocity has been examined by endal & sofia ( 1979 ) and more recently , by heger , langer & woosley ( 2000 ) and meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) .",
    "these models explicitly follow the radial exchange of angular momentum during the course of stellar evolution .",
    "the studies of heger , langer & woosley ( 2000 ) and meynet & maeder ( 2000 ) focus on stars of @xmath920m@xmath22 which is more massive than that considered in our sample ( 12 - 5m@xmath22 ; bressan et al .",
    "a major distinction between massive stars and those considered in our sample is the dominance of mass loss on the course of ms evolution .",
    "their high mass - loss rates lead to the removal of large amounts of angular momentum .",
    "mass - loss is enhanced amongst fast rotators that approach the critical angular velocity .",
    "the removal of large amounts of mass from a @xmath920m@xmath22 star results in a decline in the angular velocity over the course of ms life .",
    "the study of endal & sofia ( 1979 ) focuses on the rotational velocity evolution of a 5m@xmath22 star . here",
    ", the mass - loss rates are much reduced .",
    "the authors find that stars commencing their ms lives with relatively slow angular velocities remain slow rotators throughout the course of the ms evolution ( although there is a marked increase in angular velocity of all stars during the core contraction phase at the exhaustion of central hydrogen burning this phase is far too short to account for any observable increase in the number of rapid rotators ) . by contrast , stars commencing their lives with an angular velocity greater than 60 - 80% of the critical angular velocity spin up towards the critical velocity over a moderate fraction of the ms lifetime .",
    "the largest masses considered here are of the order of 12m@xmath22 .",
    "such stars have a mass loss rates 1.5 dex lower than those of a 20m@xmath22 star ( de jager et al .",
    "1988 ) and consequently the ms evolution is not dominated by mass - loss . hence we can assume the behaviour of the present sample is best described by the models of endal & sofia",
    ".    in a cluster , therefore , those stars closer to the ms turnoff are more likely to be rapid rotators since a proportion of them will have been spun up by evolution .",
    "less luminous stars that have not evolved as far through the ms phase will not have entered the spin up phase .",
    "this process could provide the mechanism required to explain the more rapidly rotating sample seen in the cluster population in the vicinity of the ms turnoff .",
    "our second finding , that the lmc cluster and field samples exhibit more rapid rotation than their galactic counterparts indicates a metallicity effect .",
    "our sample is insufficient to determine whether the metallicity dependence resides in the initial distribution of rotational velocities or if the magnitude of the evolutionary spin - up discussed above increases in lower metallicity environments .",
    "our observational sample is necessarily limited by the small sample size attainable with our instrumentation . to verify the findings presented here we await the extension to a larger lmc ( and smc ) sample .",
    "this is currently underway utilising the flames multi - object spectrograph on the vlt .",
    "in this paper i have presented a comparison of the rotational velocities of a sample of stars within the field and from a selection of young clusters in both the galaxy and , from our own observations , the lmc .",
    "i have presented the distribution of 100 lmc early b - type main - sequence stars .",
    "this represents the first extragalactic study of the distribution of stellar rotational velocities .",
    "it is found that the early b - star population of young clusters ( 1 - 3@xmath410@xmath5 yrs . ) in both the galaxy and the lmc exhibits more rapid rotation than the field population .",
    "i propose this can be explained by a scenario of evolutionary enhancement of the surface angular momentum brought about by angular momentum redistribution over the main - sequence lifetime .",
    "a comparison of a sample of field and cluster stars drawn from both lmc and galactic environments shows that the lmc stars a more rapid rotators than their galactic counterparts .",
    "the origin of this metallicity dependence is as yet unknown .",
