    "the existence of non - barionic dark matter is now confirmed and its density has been quantitatively estimated  @xcite .",
    "however its identity is still unknown .",
    "one of the most prominent candidates is the weakly interacting massive particle ( wimp )  @xcite .",
    "as is well known , the supersymmetric extension of the standard model provides a stable exotic particle , the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) , if r parity is conserved . among lsp candidates ,",
    "the neutralino lsp is the most suitable for non - barionic dark matter since its nature fits that of the wimp  @xcite .",
    "neutralinos are a linear combination of the supersymmetric partners of the u(1 ) and su(2 ) gauge bosons ( bino and wino ) and the higgs bosons ( higgsino ) .",
    "they have mass in a range from 100 gev to several tev and are electrically neutral .",
    "the lightest neutralino is stable if r parity is conserved .",
    "since the supersymmetric extension of the standard model is the most attractive theory , the nature of neutralino dark matter has been studied extensively  @xcite . in many scenarios of the supersymmetric model ,",
    "the lsp neutralino consists mainly of the bino , the so - called bino - like neutralino . in this case ,",
    "naive calculations show that the predicted density in the current universe is too high and it is necessary to find a way to reduce it .",
    "one mechanism to suppress the density is coannihilation  @xcite .",
    "if the next lightest supersymmetric particle ( nlsp ) is nearly degenerate in mass with the lsp , the interaction of the lsp with the nlsp is important in calculating the lsp annihilation process . for coannihilation to occur tight degeneracy is necessary , since without coannihilation the lsp decouples from the thermal bath at @xmath9  @xcite , where @xmath10 is the lsp mass .",
    "therefore the mass difference @xmath0 must satisfy @xmath11 a few % , otherwise the nlsp decouples before coannihilation becomes dominant . furthermore , if the degeneracy is much tighter , we would observe a line spectrum of photons from pair annihilation of dark matter  @xcite , since the annihilation cross section of dark matter would be strongly enhanced due to the threshold correction .",
    "a candidate for the nlsp is the stau or stop in many class of mssm , and in this paper we study the lifetime of the stau - like slepton having mass degenerate with the lsp neutralino .",
    "for the neutralino lsp to be dark matter , very tight degeneracy is required in mass between the nlsp and the lsp neutralino .",
    "in particular the heavier the lsp is , the tighter the degeneracy must be  @xcite .",
    "for such a degeneracy , the nlsp is expected to have a long lifetime due to phase space suppression  @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario for a long - lived scalar particle is the gravitino lsp .",
    "considerable work has been devoted to the long life nlsp in the context of the gravitino lsp . in this case , due to the small coupling between a superwimp ( including the gravitino ) and the nlsp ,",
    "the lifetime of the nlsp becomes very long  @xcite . to determine the most likely candidate for the lsp",
    ", we can accumulate and identify  @xcite the candidate for long - lived nlsps and compare the nature of the particles including couplings .",
    "an implication on the fundamental feature of quantum mechanics would be brought by a long life stau . as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , a small - q - value s - wave ( sqs ) decay can exhibit non - exponential decay .",
    "a small q value naively implies a small mass difference . for a gravitino lsp",
    ", the decay must occur in a p wave since the gravitino has spin 3/2 .",
    "in contrast , in our case the decay can be s wave since all daughter particles have spin 0 or spin 1/2",
    ". therefore , to extract fundamental parameters from observations we must take special care in interpreting the results .",
    "this study offers the opportunity to examine a fundamental problem of quantum physics in collider physics .",
    "hence it is worthwhile studying the proposition that the stau is the nlsp and the lightest neutralino is the lsp , and that their masses are tightly degenerate .    in sec .",
    "[ model ] , we present the relevant lagrangian and calculate the decay rate of the stau . in sec .",

    "we then consider the connection with lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) in sec .",
    "finally we summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ summary ] .",
    "in this section , we calculate the decay rate of the stau nlsp . the stau is a mass eigenstate consisting of superpartneres of left- and right - handed taus , @xmath12 here , @xmath13 is the mixing angle between @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and @xmath16 is the cp violating phase .",
    "the decay mode is governed by the mass difference , @xmath17 , according to kinematics .",
    "that is , the lifetime of the stau depends strongly on @xmath0 .",
    "we consider the following four decay modes , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 ( see fig .  [ diagrams ] ) .",
    "note that the nlsp can decay into other particles , for example , if @xmath22 gev , a d meson can be produced in the stau decay but @xmath18 is dominant in this @xmath0 region since the d meson production process is suppressed by couplings and propagators . in the 3-body and 4-body decay processes , @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 ,",
    "diagrams can be formulated with charginos as intermediate states , however , such processes are strongly suppressed by the chargino propagator and we can safely ignore them  @xcite .    ,  ( b ) @xmath26 ,  ( c ) @xmath27.,height=113 ]    in this paper , we consider the small mass difference case and hence we can ignore the momentum in the w boson propagator .",
    "thus the interaction lagrangian is given by @xmath28 the first term describes stau decay into a neutralino and a tau .",
    "here , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the projection operators and @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the coupling constants given by , for example in the bino - like neutralino case , @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the weak coupling constant and @xmath35 is the weinberg angle .",
    "the second and third terms describe tau decays into a pion and/or leptons , where @xmath36 is the fermi constant .",
    "the detailed calculation of the stau decay rate is given in the appendix [ detail - calc ] .",
    "here we show approximate formulae . in the region",
    "@xmath37 , 2-body decay ( see fig .  [ diagrams](a ) ) is allowed kinematically and is dominant .",

    "incidentally , we note that a quark can not appear alone in any physical processes , a point that was missed in ref .",
    "hence , @xmath49 and @xmath50 quarks appear only as mesons and the @xmath51 production process is relevant only for @xmath52 .    finally , when the mass difference is smaller than the pion mass , 4-body decay processes , @xmath24 and @xmath53 , are significant ( see fig .  [ diagrams](c ) ) .",
    "the approximate decay rate is calculated as @xmath54 m_{\\tau } ( \\delta m)^2 \\left ( 2(\\delta m)^2 - 19 m_{l}^2 \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ &        \\qquad + 3 |g_r|^2 m_{\\tau}^2 \\delta m \\left ( 2(\\delta m)^2 - 23 m_{l}^2 \\right )          \\biggr ] ~. \\label{approximated_gamma4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath55 is the charged lepton ( @xmath56 or @xmath57 ) mass .",
    "in this section , we discuss the parameter dependence of the stau lifetime and the cosmological constraints for the parameters in the bino - like lsp case . from eqs .",
    "( [ approximated_gamma2 ] ) , ( [ approximated_gamma3 ] ) , and ( [ approximated_gamma4 ] ) , we see that the stau lifetime depends on @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "first , we examine the neutralino mass dependence of the lifetime .",
    "we consider the cosmological constraints for dark matter to get the mass range of the lsp .",
    "it is well known that the dark matter relic density is reduced by the coannihilation process and hence the neutralino mass can be heavier than it would be without coannihilation . accounting for the coannihilation process",
    "gives a neutralino mass range  ( the first ref .",
    "of @xcite ) of @xmath60 here , we use cmssm bound as a reference value of @xmath2 , though we study the stau lifetime in general mssm framework , since it is not strongly dependent on @xmath2 as noted below .",
    "this is consistent with the cosmological constraint , @xmath61 .",
    "it is clear from eqs .  , , and that the stau lifetime is proportional to the neutralino mass and therefore in the mass range given in eq .",
    ", the stau lifetime varies by a factor of three .",
    "taking this into account , we use only @xmath62 in our figures .",
    "next , we consider the @xmath0 dependence of the stau lifetime .",
    "for coannihilation to occur , the mass difference must satisfy @xmath63 a few % or smaller  @xcite .",
    "therefore , @xmath0 must be smaller than a few gev .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the total stau lifetime and the partial lifetimes of each decay mode in this @xmath0 region is shown in fig .",
    "[ lifetime300 ] . in fig .",
    "[ lifetime300 ] , we set the values as follows : @xmath64 gev , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .    .",
    "the lines label electron , muon , pion , and tau correspond to the processes @xmath67 , @xmath24 , @xmath23 , and @xmath68 , respectively . here",
    "we take @xmath64 gev , @xmath69 , and @xmath66.,height=377 ]    > from fig .",
    "[ lifetime300 ] , we can see which mode is dominant for a certain @xmath0 .",
    "the figure shows that the lifetime increases drastically as @xmath0 becomes smaller than the tau mass .",
    "this is because taus are produced in the region @xmath70 , while in the region @xmath71 , taus can not be produced and instead pions appear in the final state . at @xmath72",
    "the lifetime increases slightly .",
    "this is due to the fact that the dominant mode changes from 3-body to 4-body decay .",
    "in contrast , at @xmath73 the lifetime does not increase much , even though above this mass , muons can be created .",
    "this is because at the pion mass , the muon production process is already kinematically suppressed and the electron production process governs the stau decay .    to understand the @xmath0 dependence of the lifetime quantitatively and",
    "intuitively we determine the power of @xmath0 in the decay rate , considering stau decay into neutralino and @xmath74 massless particles .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the decay rate is determined by the phase space and the squared amplitude  @xcite .",
    "first , we examine the @xmath0 dependence by considering the phase space . for 2-body decay ,",
    "a phase space consideration gives @xmath75 by using a recursion relation between @xmath76 and @xmath77 , the phase space of @xmath78-body decay renders the @xmath0 dependence as @xmath79    second , we consider the @xmath0 dependence from the squared amplitude .",
    "if all of the @xmath74 massless particles are fermions , the squared amplitude depends on @xmath0 as @xmath80 since it depends linearly on the massless fermion momentum .",
    "thus , we obtain the dependence of the decay rate on @xmath0 for a final state of only fermions , @xmath81    in contrast , if one pion(ng - boson ) appears in the stau decay process , the @xmath0 dependence of the squared amplitude becomes @xmath82 this change in the decay process is due to the fact that the amplitude of the pion production is proportional to the pion momentum .",
    "namely , the squared amplitude of the pion production process is proportional to the pion momentum squared .",
    "thus the @xmath0 dependence of the process , in which one pion is involved , is @xmath83 in the massless limit of external line particles , the @xmath0 dependences of our results , calculated in appendix [ detail - calc ] , are @xmath84 which are consistent with eq .",
    "( [ dm_dep_fermion ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ dm_dep_pi ] ) .",
    "more precisely , by taking into account the masses of the produced particles , we get the complicated @xmath0 dependences @xmath85 these equations clearly show the @xmath0 dependence of the stau lifetime .",
    "we next consider the @xmath86 dependence of the stau lifetime .",
    "figure  [ cp_life ] shows the lifetime as a function of the cp violating phase .",
    "we set the other parameters to be @xmath62 , @xmath87 , and @xmath88 .    , and @xmath88 .",
    "]    > from fig .",
    "[ cp_life ] , it is clear that the cp violating phase does not greatly affect the stau lifetime , and so we fix @xmath89 ( no cp violation ) .    as expressed in eq .",
    ", the effect of cp violation appears in the @xmath90 $ ] terms only . since the coefficients of the @xmath90 $ ] terms are smaller than those of @xmath91 , it is again clear that the cp violating phase does not greatly affect the stau lifetime .",
    "the @xmath93 dependence of the stau lifetime is as strong as the @xmath0 dependence .",
    "figure  [ enlargedlifetime ] shows the @xmath92 dependence of the stau lifetime with @xmath62 and @xmath89 .     and @xmath89 .",
    "left panel : @xmath94 gev , right panel : @xmath95.,title=\"fig:\",height=207 ]   and @xmath89 . left panel : @xmath94 gev , right panel : @xmath95.,title=\"fig:\",height=207 ]    we can see from the right panel in fig .  [ enlargedlifetime ] that for @xmath96 , @xmath97 decays much more quickly than @xmath98 .",
    "this can be understood by considering two steps .",
    "first , we note that only left - handed virtual taus contribute to the final state @xmath99 .",
    "second , @xmath97 converts to @xmath100 by picking up @xmath101 in the tau propagator , while @xmath98 converts by picking up the momentum @xmath102 in the propagator . since @xmath103 ,",
    "the former contribution is much larger and hence there is a strong dependence on @xmath92 .      finally ,",
    "we consider the constraints from big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . the stau lifetime will be constrained by the standard bbn scenario .",
    "particularly , in the case where a stau decays into hadrons , the constraint on the stau lifetime is more stringent  @xcite . at @xmath104 ( sec ) ( @xmath105 is the age of the universe ) , pions emitted from a stau decay also decay before they interact with the background nucleons , so they do not affect bbn .",
    "however , if pions are emitted at @xmath106 ( sec ) , they inter - convert a background proton and neutron into each other , even after the normal freeze - out time of the n / p ratio .",
    "therefore we must take careful consideration to the parameter region in which pions are emitted for ( bbn start ) @xmath107 ( bbn end ) , i.e. @xmath108 . naively interpreting fig .",
    "38 in ref .",
    "@xcite , we can conclude that the corresponding parameter region can neglect the constraints from bbn .",
    "this is inferred from the fact that the @xmath109 number density is roughly two orders lower than that of baryons , @xmath110 , since @xmath111 is of the order of several hundreds of gev , and the released energy is less than @xmath112 gev .",
    "here @xmath113 is the ratio of the stau number density to the entropy density .",
    "thus @xmath114 gev , which does not influence the bbn for @xmath115 sec .",
    "incidentally , it is apparent from fig.5 that stau lifetime can not exceed the age of universe ( about 4.1 @xmath116 sec ) .",
    "it is consistent with the fact that an exotic heavy charged particle has not been observed yet .     and @xmath92 .",
    "to emphasize the bbn era , we draw thick lines for @xmath117 and @xmath118 sec.,height=302 ]",
    "we next consider lfv .",
    "the nlsp slepton might be a linear combination of flavor eigenstates .",
    "it is expected that lepton flavor violating events will be observed due to this mixing , such as @xmath119 .",
    "if we observe @xmath120 or @xmath121 events , then within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , we would conclude that the selectron forms part of the nlsp : @xmath122 the branching ratio of @xmath120 is roughly proportional to @xmath123 .",
    "the current upper bound on the branching ratio , @xmath124 , gives a poor constraint , at most @xmath125 .",
    "if @xmath126 , the nlsp slepton can decay , @xmath127 with a lifetime of @xmath128 we may interpret the result as implying that the nlsp slepton consists only of a scalar electron since it decays only into an electron .",
    "the lifetime is so short , even if @xmath129 , that we can not accumulate the nlsp .",
    "however if we can measure the lifetime , we can determine the fraction of the scalar electron in the nlsp slepton .",
    "further evidence is given by flavor violating processes of both charged leptons  @xcite and the neutrino  @xcite .",
    "it is important to interpret all the lfv processes together .",
    "we have studied an mssm scenario in which the lsp and nlsp are a bino - like neutralino and a stau , respectively .",
    "since the mass difference is , in many cases , assumed to be degenerate , from the requirement of coannihilation , we paid special attention to the very small @xmath0 case .",
    "we calculated the partial lifetimes for the decay modes shown in fig .",
    "[ diagrams ] .    we have investigated the stau lifetime dependence on @xmath0 , @xmath92 , @xmath86 , and @xmath2 , considering cosmological constraints .",
    "the lifetime strongly depends on @xmath0 and @xmath92 , while it is almost independent of @xmath86 and @xmath2 .    the stau lifetime dependence on @xmath0 changes as each threshold is crossed .",
    "when @xmath0 is larger than @xmath101 , the lifetime increases in proportion to @xmath130 as @xmath0 decreases . in the range",
    "@xmath131 the lifetime obeys the scaling @xmath132 .",
    "below @xmath45 , it grows with @xmath133 .",
    "the @xmath0 dependence of the stau lifetime can be largely understood by counting the mass dimension of phase space and the squared amplitude in the massless limit of standard model particles . while the massless limit is a good approximation in regions far from the thresholds , the @xmath0 dependence near the thresholds",

    "the superwimp case is similar .",
    "however , in the gravitino scenario an energetic @xmath43 is apparently produced , while in our scenario we should observe very low energy @xmath134 , @xmath57 , or @xmath56 .",
    "therefore a clean experiment is required .",
    "the ilc would be most suitable for investigating the nature of the nlsp slepton .",

    "it is almost impossible to calculate the exact mass eigenvalue using qcd .",
    "it is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for future work .",
    "we have also discussed lepton flavor violation due to slepton mixing .",
    "if there is even a tiny component of a scalar electron or a scalar muon in the nlsp `` stau '' , the decay signal of the nlsp will be completely different from the pure stau case .",
