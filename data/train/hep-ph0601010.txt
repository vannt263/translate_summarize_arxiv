    "the phase diagram of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) has attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "the region of high baryon density and low temperature is relevant for the description of deconfined quark matter , which can be found in the centers of neutron stars .",
    "it is expected to exhibit a  variety of color - superconducting phases.@xcite    unfortunately , there is only very little firm knowledge concerning the behavior of the cold and dense quark matter . at very high densities ,",
    "asymptotic freedom of qcd allows one to use weak - coupling methods to determine the structure of the ground state . on the other hand",
    ", the phenomenologically interesting region of densities corresponds to the strong - coupling regime where _ ab initio _ calculations within qcd are not available .    at the same time , current techniques of lattice numerical computations are not able to reach sufficiently high densities , due to the complexity of the fermionic dirac operator that occurs in the euclidean path - integral measure .",
    "this gave rise to the interest in qcd - like theories that are amenable to lattice simulations , in particular the two - color qcd with fundamental quarks and three - color qcd with adjoint quarks.@xcite    it turns out that these theories may also be studied by the means of a  low - energy effective field theory similar to the chiral perturbation theory of qcd , and non - trivial information about their phase diagram thus obtained . within this approach",
    ", the structure of the phase diagram has been investigated in detail , including the effects of finite temperature.@xcite the model - independent predictions of the low - energy effective field theory have been complemented by lattice computations@xcite and calculations within several models.@xcite    the aim of the present letter is to provide an alternative low - energy effective formulation of the simplest of this class of theories  the two - color qcd with two quark flavors .",
    "while the general description of the whole class is based on the extended @xmath1 chiral symmetry of the underlying lagrangian with @xmath2 quark flavors , we construct the effective lagrangian by exploiting the lie algebra isomorphism @xmath3 .",
    "we show that such a  picture displays more transparently the physical content of the theory and at the same time allows for an easy determination of the true ground state , which has been sought by a  convenient ansatz previously .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we summarize the basic features of two - color qcd to set the stage for the following considerations .",
    "next we work out the mapping between the coset space @xmath0 that we use , and the @xmath4 used in the literature .",
    "the rest of the paper is devoted to the construction of the effective lagrangian and its detailed analysis .",
    "in this section we recall the basic properties of two - color qcd , following closely the treatment of kogut _ _ et al.__@xcite the distinguishing feature of two - color qcd is the pseudoreality of the gauge group generators , the pauli matrices , @xmath5 .",
    "consider now a  set of @xmath2 quark flavors in the fundamental representation of the gauge group . as an immediate consequence , we may trade the right - handed component of the quark field , @xmath6 ( flavor and color indices",

    "( the pauli matrices @xmath8 act in the dirac space . )    instead of the usual dirac spinor , @xmath9 , we now work with the left - handed spinor , @xmath10 , in terms of which the quark euclidean lagrangian of the massive two - color qcd at finite chemical potential becomes @xmath11 .",

    "is invariant under the extended global symmetry @xmath1 , which includes the naive chiral group @xmath25 and additional symmetry transformations due to the pseudoreality of the gauge group generators .",
    "the global symmetry is spontaneously broken by the standard chiral condensate down to its @xmath26 subgroup .",
    "the low - energy effective field theory for the goldstone bosons of the broken symmetry is thus naturally constructed on the coset space @xmath27 .",
    "this is parametrized by an antisymmetric unimodular unitary matrix @xmath28 , in terms of which the leading - order effective lagrangian reads @xmath29 the @xmath30 s denote the covariant derivatives , @xmath31 while @xmath32 serves as a  source field for @xmath28 , and is eventually set to @xmath33 .",
    "the quark mass @xmath34 is connected to the goldstone boson mass squared @xmath35 by the gell - mann  oakes  renner relation @xmath36    it is worth emphasizing that the incorporation of the chemical potential into the effective theory involves no extra free parameters  the way the chemical potential enters the lagrangian is fixed by the form of the covariant derivatives .",
    "from now on we shall restrict our attention to the case @xmath37 . in that case , note the lie algebra isomorphisms @xmath3 and @xmath38 .",
    "this allows us to recast the low - energy effective field theory on the @xmath0 coset.@xcite there are altogether five degrees of freedom , or goldstone bosons , corresponding to the five independent entries of the antisymmetric unimodular unitary matrix @xmath28 .",

    "let us in addition show a  simple argument that suggests how to choose in general a  set of matrices satisfying eq . .",
    "recall that six independent antisymmetric _ hermitian _",
    "@xmath42 matrices generate the real lie algebra @xmath53 .",
    "this means that we deal with two sets of three matrices , which can be shown to fulfill the usual anticommutator of pauli matrices , @xmath54 . by multiplying the matrices from one of the sets by @xmath55",
    ", we arrive at three hermitian matrices , @xmath56 , and three anti - hermitian ones , @xmath57 .",
    "these satisfy the relations @xmath58=0,\\ ] ] that are equivalent to eq . .",
    "it remains to prove that eq . provides a  one - to - one parametrization of the coset @xmath4 .",
    "to that end , note that any antisymmetric @xmath42 matrix @xmath59 may be expanded in the basis @xmath41 , @xmath60 , where @xmath61 are in general complex coefficients .",
    "the unitarity of @xmath59 constrains these coefficients as @xmath62 the @xmath63 and @xmath64 being the real and imaginary parts of @xmath61 , respectively .",
    "it is now crucial to observe that the products @xmath65 for @xmath66 span the set of @xmath67 linearly independent generators of @xmath68 so that the unitarity of @xmath59 requires separately @xmath69 and @xmath70 for all pairs of @xmath71 .",
    "the latter condition means that the complex phases of all the @xmath61 s must be equal so that @xmath72 with real @xmath73 , while the former one requires @xmath74 .",
    "it is a  matter of simple algebra to calculate the determinant of @xmath59 , @xmath75    since the elements of the coset @xmath4 are unimodular matrices , we are left with two distinct possibilities , @xmath76 or @xmath77 .",
    "( the next solution , @xmath78 , already corresponds to @xmath76 with just the sign of all the @xmath73 s inverted . )    in conclusion , every antisymmetric unimodular unitary matrix @xmath28 may be cast in the form , where @xmath40 is either real , or pure imaginary vector .",
    "however , in the standard coset construction of the effective lagrangian,@xcite the global symmetry group is required to act transitively on the parameter space of the goldstone fields that is , the actual coset space must be connected . as the chiral condensate ,",
    "above which we build our effective theory , is described by the matrix @xmath47 ( note that @xmath79 ) , we have to choose the connected component with real @xmath40 , as in eq . .",

    "the problem of finding the ground state thus reduces to minimizing the expression , @xmath103 on the sphere @xmath104 .",

    "we were also able to give a  simple proof of the fact that the condensate taken previously as an ansatz is indeed the true ground state , and we thus justified the assumptions made in the older work .",
    "since the @xmath159-symmetric nonlinear sigma model is known to great detail , the connection provided in this letter can hopefully lead to the improvement in the understanding of the phase diagram of the two - color qcd at low energies , at least in the two - flavor case .",
