    "pictorially , operations are represented by ` boxes ' with input and output ` wires ' ( fig .",
    "operations whose input system is trivial ( depicted with no wire ) are called _ preparations _ , and those whose output system is trivial are called _ measurements _ ( the trivial system is denoted by @xmath5 ) .",

    "a circuit formalizes the idea of information exchange mediated by systems @xcite . by definition ,",
    "the wires in a circuit are the only means of information exchange responsible for the correlations between the events in the boxes .",
    "one can figuratively think of the boxes in a circuit as isolated space - time regions , which can communicate with each other only through the wires ( see supplementary methods ) .",
    "the description of the operation in a given box is determined only based on variables in that box .",
    "an opt is completely defined by specifying all possible operations and the probabilities for the outcomes of all possible circuits .",
    "it is formulated in terms of equivalence classes of operations  if two operations @xmath2 and @xmath11 yield the same joint probabilities in all circuits they may be plugged in , they are deemed equivalent .",
    "similarly , we define equivalence classes of events @xmath12 and @xmath13 that may belong to different operations . they are called _ transformations _ @xcite . in the case of preparation and measurement events ,",
    "they are called _ states _ and _ effects _ , respectively @xcite .",
    "the joint probabilities of preparation and measurement events are then functions of the state and effect only , @xmath14 .",
    "states are thus real functions on effects and vice versa .",
    "quantum theory is a special case of opt , in which a system @xmath0 is associated with a hilbert space @xmath15 of dimension @xmath16 ( we assume finite dimensions ) , and a transformation from @xmath0 to @xmath1 is a completely positive ( cp ) and trace - nonincreasing linear map @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the space of linear operators over @xmath19 .",
    "( the hilbert space of a composite system @xmath20 is the tensor product @xmath21 ) .",

    "using a convenient isomorphism , states @xmath23 and effects @xmath24 are represented as positive semidefinite ( ps ) operators @xmath25 ( see supplementary methods ) .",
    "in particular , a preparation is described by a set of ps operators @xmath26 , such that @xmath27 , and a measurement by a set of ps operators @xmath28 , such that @xmath29 .",
    "the joint probabilities of states and effects are then given by @xmath30",
    "operations in the standard formulation of quantum theory obey the axiom of _ causality _",
    "@xcite , which says that for every preparation @xmath6 composed with a measurement @xmath31 , the probabilities of the preparation events do not depend on the measurement , i.e. , @xmath32 is the same for every @xmath31 .",
    "this implies that the outcomes of past operations in a circuit do not depend on operations in the future .",
    "but the outcomes of future operations can depend on past operations , which shows an explicit time asymmetry in the standard formulation of quantum theory .",
    "the essence of this asymmetry can be understood by observing that an operation is implicitly assumed to be realized _ without post - selection _ , i.e. , the occurrence of an operation is assumed conditional only on information available prior to the time of the input system ( see supplementary methods ) . indeed , conditionally on information available in the future ,",
    "we could obtain non - standard ` operations ' in a given box , which violate the axiom .",
    "thus , the axiom expresses a non - trivial constraint on the operations obtainable by pre - selection only .",
    "an accurate comparison between the forward and the backward direction of time requires identifying the ` pre - selected ' operations in the backward direction .",
    "they correspond to the sets of possible events in a given box that can be known to have occurred in the past in the forward direction , and include all subsets of the outcomes of standard operations .",
    "thus , there is a physical asymmetry concerning the fact that the operations that can be obtained without post - selection in the two directions of time are different .",
    "the origin of this asymmetry will be analyzed later .",
    "a time - symmetric theory should describe physics in both directions of time via the same rules . since the events that correspond to valid operations according to the no - post - selection criterion respect the causality axiom in one direction but not the other , based on this criterion there does not exist an empirically confirmed time - symmetric theory that agrees with the circuit connections assumed in the standard theory . without _",
    "ad hoc _ assumptions , the only way of obtaining such a theory is to drop the no - post - selection criterion from the definition of operation .",
    "we therefore propose to view an operation simply as a description of the possible events in a given box , conditional on information obtained without looking into other boxes in the circuit , irrespectively of when in time this information is available .",
    "( we will show that any constraints on the latter follow from the form of the dynamics in space - time . ) from this perspective , learning or discarding of information about the outcomes of an operation should yield another valid operation in agreement with the corresponding update of the probabilities in a circuit .",
    "we next develop the generalized formulation of quantum theory that follows from this point of view .",
    "the generalized formulation is summarized by the following rules ( see derivation in methods ) .",
    "equivalent operations are described by a collection of cp maps @xmath33 , where @xmath34 satisfies @xmath35 ( note that @xmath36 does not have to be trace - preserving . )",
    "the sequential composition of two operations @xmath2 and @xmath37 is a new operation @xmath38 , where @xmath39 unless @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the null cp map . in the latter case ,",
    "the composition never occurs , or , equivalently , its result is the _",
    "null _ operation from @xmath0 to @xmath42 .    as in the standard formulation @xcite ,",
    "cp maps from the trivial system to itself are interpreted as probabilities .",
    "since every circuit is equivalent to an operation from the trivial system to itself , the above rules define the probabilities for all circuits .",
    "importantly , the equivalent events , or _ transformations _ , are not given by the cp maps above .",
    "they are described by _",
    "pairs _ of cp maps , @xmath43 , with the property @xmath44    _ states _ are represented by @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and _ effects _ by @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , with the main probability rule reading @xmath53 ( born s rule is obtained for @xmath54 , @xmath55 . )",
    "notably , the sets of states and effects , viewed as real functions on each other via eq .",
    ", are not closed under convex combinations .",
    "the convex combinations of these functions do not correspond to events that can be obtained by local procedures in the preparation and measurement boxes ( see methods ) .",
    "the most general rule for updating an operation upon learning or discarding of information is presented in methods .",
    "under time reversal @xmath56 , every operation @xmath2 is expected to be seen as an operation @xmath57 , such that the probabilities of any circuit under this map @xmath56 remain invariant . in particular , states should become effects and vice versa , such that their joint probabilities are preserved .",
    "there are , however , infinitely many transformations with this property .",
    "time reversal is a specific map between the spaces of states and effects , which is determined by the laws of mechanics and should be understood in the following sense .",
    "imagine that we could create a measurement box whose classical description looks just like that of a given preparation box operating in reverse temporal order .",
    "the measurement implemented by the measurement box is the time - reversed image of the preparation implemented by the preparation box ( fig .",
    "before we discuss how the two can be related , we give a characterization of all possible symmetry transformations , i.e. , all transformations of boxes that leave the probabilities of circuits invariant .        a crucial insight in our analysis",
    "is that states and effects on the same systems @xmath0 are _ distinct _ objects  they are associated with separate events and live in separate spaces , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , even though we describe them using operators in the same space @xmath60 .",
    "importantly , the latter is based on a canonical isomorphism which merely reflects a choice of representation of the pairing between dual vectors , @xmath61 $ ] ( see methods ) .",
    "therefore , a symmetry transformation @xmath62 must be defined by its action on both spaces , @xmath63 .",
    "we can distinguish two types of symmetry transformations .",
    "_ @xmath5those that map states to states and effects to effects ( e.g. , spatial rotation ) .",
    "they can be thought of as consisting of a pair of transformations , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , whose form in the canonical representation will be denoted by @xmath66 , @xmath67 . _ type _",
    "@xmath68those that map states to effects and effects to states ( e.g. , time reversal ) .",
    "they can be thought of as consisting of a pair of transformations , @xmath69 and @xmath70 , whose canonical representation will be denoted by @xmath71 , @xmath72 .",
    "hereafter , we drop the superscript @xmath0 .    _",
    "theorem_. consider a system with hilbert space @xmath73 of dimension @xmath74 .",
    "symmetry transformations of _ type _ @xmath5 have the form @xmath75 or the form @xmath76 where @xmath77 denotes transposition in some basis , and @xmath78 is an invertible operator .",
    "similarly , symmetry transformations of _ type _ @xmath68 have the form @xmath79 or the form @xmath80 this implies the transformation of arbitrary operations . the proof is presented in methods .",
    "if we assume that an isolated system must follow unitary evolution driven by a hamiltonian , and energy should not change under time reversal , we obtain that time reversal must be described by a transformation of the form and ( see methods ) . if this is to hold for arbitrary hamiltonians , then @xmath81 must be unitary .",
    "the concrete @xmath81 , which depends on the transposition basis , would be determined by how specific observables transform under time reversal ( e.g. , energy remains invariant , spin changes sign ) .",
    "note that since the generalized formulation permits more general than unitary evolutions , transformations with non - unitary @xmath81 are also conceivable in principle .",
    "the original classification of symmetries by wigner @xcite is obtained within the traditional exposition of quantum theory , where one does not distinguish states and effects but speaks of transition probabilities between states only .",
    "if we were to similarly interpret the canonical representations of effects in the state space ( times @xmath82 ) as states , a symmetry transformation would be described by a single map from states to states and we would obtain that @xmath81 must be unitary .",
    "the operators @xmath83 would then transform as either @xmath84 or @xmath85 , which amounts respectively to a unitary or an anti - unitary transformation on the vectors in the underlying hilbert space , which agrees with wigner s theorem .",
    "however , from an operational perspective there is no justification for this identification of states with effects .",
    "furthermore , the traditional conclusion about the form of time reversal @xcite is derived assuming that the transition probabilities given by born s rule remain invariant under time reversal . in practice",
    ", such a transition corresponds to a measurement event following a preparation event , and the conditional probabilities of events in the reverse order are not the same in general .",
    "this is why , in our view , the traditional conclusion is not justified .",
    "in contrast , the generalized formulation developed here gives an empirically consistent definition of time - reversal symmetry .",
    "however , it also shows the possibility for transformations with non - unitary @xmath81 .",
    "and @xmath86 is then encoded in the outcomes of operations on the boundaries of this space - time region . the information available at time @xmath87 is contained in the preparation box .",
    "an observer at @xmath87 can have direct access only to this information but not to the information in the measurement box . according to such an observer , all future circuits consist of standard operations if and only if the final measurement @xmath88 satisfies @xmath89.,width=302 ]    we now investigate why without post - selection in the forward direction of time we can only implement standard quantum operations , which does not hold backward in time .",
    "assume that isolated systems evolve unitarily forward in time , as prescribed by the known laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "this means that if we consider all systems in the universe between times @xmath87 and @xmath86 , @xmath90 , we can describe their evolution by a unitary circuit ( or one joint unitary operation ) , such that the classical information about all events between the two times is encoded in the outcomes of operations on the past and future boundaries of the circuit ( fig .",
    "4 ) . by definition ,",
    "all information available prior to @xmath87 is contained in the preparation box ( the box can be imagined to extend to the infinite past ) .",
    "an observer inside that box can update the description of the events in the box , but not of the events in future boxes .",
    "so according to an observer prior to @xmath87 , the future events in the universe would look as in fig .",
    "4 , where the preparation may be updated , but the final measurement is fixed . any effective circuit in some region in the future between times @xmath87 and @xmath86 according to this observer must be consistent with the big unitary circuit , i.e. , all future circuits should be possible to purify , by including the devices and environments in the description , to the circuit in fig .",
    "it is well known that if the effective circuits consist of standard operations , their unitary purification can be done with a final measurement that is a standard quantum measurement .",
    "reversely , if every future circuit must consist of standard operations , the final measurement in particular must be a standard measurement . in other words ,",
    "the claim that all future circuits that can be known at a given time unconditionally on future events must be standard quantum circuits is equivalent to a statement about the form of the future boundary operation in the circuit of the universe .",
    "this boundary operation can be moved arbitrarily far into the future , transforming it consistently with the unitary dynamics .    to analyze the time - reversed situation , assume for simplicity that time reversal",
    "is described by eqs .   and with @xmath91 ( the exact form of time reversal does not affect the probabilities of events ) . in this case , the reverse evolution is unitary and we have a similar picture to the previous case , but with a possibly non - standard future measurement .",
    "as argued earlier , the causality axiom does not hold for pre - selected operations in the reverse direction , which means that the ` future ' measurement backward in time indeed can not be a standard one .",
    "this means that the preparation in the past boundary of the universe in the forward direction ( fig .",
    "4 ) can not give the maximally mixed state on average .",
    "if the preparation gave the maximally mixed state on average , we could not have memory of the past consistently with unitarity , because at any time , systems coming from the past would be uncorrelated . by the same token",
    ", the form of the future boundary measurement implies that we can not have memory of the future .",
    "this establishes an exact link between the psychological @xcite and ` quantum ' arrows of time .",
    "interestingly , fig .",
    "4 contains the possibility that not all classical information available in the past is available in the future , just like there is information in the future that can not be known in the past .",
    "one can think of this as information that is lost in the forward direction of time .    by considering the purification of circuits on larger systems",
    ", we can understand the mechanism by which information about these circuits reaches different space - time locations .",
    "for example , fig . 5 illustrates how a non - standard future boundary measurement can lead to present information about non - standard operations in the future .",
    "can allow present knowledge of future cp maps @xmath92 that are not proportional to cptp maps.,width=302 ]    unlike previous models of quantum mechanics with past and future boundary conditions @xcite , our approach does not interpret the future condition as a constraint on the future state of the universe , but on the future effects .",
    "it gives an explicit picture of the flow of information in space - time , where classical information by definition lives on the boundary .",
    "we have argued that an empirically consistent notion of time - reversal symmetry in quantum theory requires a generalized notion of operation , whose implementation can involve both pre- and post - selection .",
    "this has allowed us to give a rigorous definition of time - reversal symmetry based on the preservation of probabilities of events .",
    "the operational approach provides a different understanding of the accepted notion of time reversal : it is a map between two separate spaces  those of states and effects  and not from the space of states to itself .",
    "this has revealed the possibility for symmetry transformations beyond the standard classes of unitary and anti - unitary transformations predicted by wigner s theorem .",
    "could such symmetries be realized in nature ?",
    "one possibility is that they may arise in a novel sense in scenarios defined through post - selection , still in agreement with the known laws of quantum mechanics .",
    "another possibility is that they may be relevant in new physical regimes , such as those where both quantum theory and gravity play a role .",
    "indeed , these symmetry transformations , like the most general evolutions permitted in the time - symmetric formulation , are post - selection - like transformations of the kind proposed to model the dynamics of quantum systems in the presence of black holes and closed time - like curves @xcite .",
    "such models are often referred to as ` non - linear ' extensions of quantum theory , but we have seen that this is not precise , because the notion of state in the extended theory is not the same as the standard one , and the state space is not convex .",
    "we believe that this insight is an important stepping stone for the understanding of such models .",
    "the time - symmetric approach to the notion of operation proposed here is also conceptually suited for theories with no background time , as in the context of gravity .",
    "building upon recent ideas for quantum theory with indefinite causal structure @xcite , the present formulation can be extended to an operational quantum theory without any predefined time @xcite .",
    "our demonstration that the circuit notion of causality can be regarded as non - fundamental offers a new perspective on the role of causal structure in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "we consider as a valid operation any set of possible events that can be obtained by a local procedure inside a box with an input and an output system , without assumptions on whether the procedure involves pre- or post - selection .",
    "if a set of events defines a valid operation in this sense , so does any subset of this set , because any subset can be selected inside the box .",
    "we assume that standard quantum theory holds , and we derive its generalized formulation based on this principle without additional assumptions .",
    "consider a preparation box implementing the standard preparation @xmath26 , which is connected via the system @xmath0 to a measurement box implementing the standard measurement @xmath28 ( we use the representation of preparations and measurements in terms of ps operators in @xmath93 ) .",
    "the joint probabilities of the preparation and measurement outcomes are given by @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "assuming that the probability for the preparation event to belong to the subset @xmath97 and the measurement event to belong to the subset @xmath98 is nonzero , by locally discarding those cases in which the events do not belong to the respective subsets , we obtain two new operations connected to each other by the system @xmath0 , whose joint probabilities are given by @xmath99 for all @xmath100 .    from eq .",
    ", we see that two sets of preparation events described by operators @xmath101 and @xmath102 yield the same probabilities if and only if their operators differ by an overall factor , @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 . the same holds for the sets of measurement events .",
    "we can therefore choose a normalization in order to dispose of the irrelevant degree of freedom .",
    "we define equivalent preparations and measurements to be described by sets of ps operators that satisfy the normalizations ( we choose different normalizations for preparations and measurements to keep parallelism with the standard formalism , which can be seen as a special case of the new one ) : @xmath106 note that preparations are described just as before , but measurements are now more general as they do not have to satisfy @xmath107 .    introducing the notation @xmath108 @xmath109 we can write the main probability rule in the form @xmath110 for any preparation and measurement for which @xmath111 .    unlike the standard approach to opts , here",
    "not all preparations and measurements defined over the same system are compatible  some of them are simply never found connected to each other .",
    "equivalently , we can say that their connection results in the _",
    "null event_. these are the preparations and measurements for which @xmath112 , where @xmath113 is the null operator on system @xmath0 . the joint probabilities for the outcomes of such a pair of preparation and measurement can be defined to be all zero ( i.e. , no outcome occurs ) .",
    "it is easily seen from eq .   that the equivalence classes of preparation events , or _ states _ ,",
    "are now described by a pair of ps operators @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , @xmath47 , while the equivalence classes of measurement events , or _ effects _ , are described by a pair of ps operators @xmath49 , where @xmath50 , @xmath51 .",
    "the joint probability rule for a pair of state and effect is given by eq .  .",
    "via eq .  , states are real functions on effects and vice versa .",
    "however , the sets of states and effects are not closed under convex combinations ( only some subsets of them are  those that correspond to the same @xmath114 or @xmath115 ) . even though we may conceive of the convex combinations of these functions",
    ", they generally do not correspond to events that can be obtained by local procedures in the preparation and measurement boxes .    to see this ,",
    "consider for example two deterministic preparations , each preparing one of the two orthogonal standard states @xmath116 and @xmath117 , @xmath118 . in the above language of states described by two operators ,",
    "these correspond to @xmath119 and @xmath120 . regarding them as functions on effects ,",
    "imagine that we want to find a procedure inside a preparation box that yields a convex combination of these functions , such as @xmath121 .",
    "any preparation that we may perform inside a box with an output system ( allowing both pre- and post - selection ) is captured by standard preparations .",
    "the desired convex combination must therefore correspond to some state @xmath122 .",
    "but it is easy to see that such a state does not exist .",
    "indeed , the requirement that it yields the desired convex combination of probabilities with all effects of the form @xmath123 implies that @xmath124 .",
    "but then for effects @xmath125 with @xmath126 , the probabilities would generally not respect the convex combination : @xmath127 of course , we may simulate the desired convex combination by suitably post - selecting preparation and measurement events , but this requires joint post - selection , which is not achievable by separate procedures in the preparation and measurement boxes .    note that a deterministic state , i.e. , a state associated with the outcome of a single - outcome preparation , is described by a pair of identical density operators @xmath128 . because of this redundancy , we can parameterize the space of deterministic states by a single density operator , just like the space of deterministic states in the standard formulation of quantum theory .",
    "the probabilities for the outcomes of a measurement applied on a deterministic state @xmath129 are given by @xmath130 which reduces to born s rule in the special case @xmath131 .",
    "in particular , the set of deterministic states can be regarded as real functions on effects . as we saw in the above example",
    ", this set is not closed under convex combinations , even though the operators by which we describe deterministic states form a convex set  the usual set of density operators . as functions of these operators ,",
    "the probabilities for measurement outcomes are not linear , but we emphasize that this does not mean non - linearity in the state as defined in an operational sense .",
    "the spaces of states and effects over a system @xmath0 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 , can be equipped with a natural distance .",
    "let @xmath132 and @xmath133 be two states in @xmath58 .",

    "if @xmath142 and @xmath143 have different supports , the two states are maximally distant no matter how small @xmath144 may be , as long as it is nonzero . indeed , in the case when one of @xmath142 or @xmath143 has support that is inside ( but different from ) the support of the other , say , @xmath145",
    ", we can achieve the maximum value of @xmath146 for the right - hand side of eq .   by choosing an effect @xmath147 such that @xmath148 is orthogonal to @xmath149 and has non - zero overlap with @xmath150 . in the case",
    "when none of @xmath142 or @xmath143 has support that is inside the support of the other , the same effect also yields the maximum value .",
    "the maximum distance between these states reflects the fact that there exists a measurement event that can occur together with one of the preparation events but not with the other .    as for preparations and measurements",
    ", one can define the equivalence classes of general operations and general events .",
    "equivalent operations are described by a collection of cp maps with the normalization @xmath151 which reduces to the normalization of preparations and measurements in the respective limiting cases . defining @xmath152 one sees that equivalent events , or _ transformations _ , from @xmath0 to @xmath1",

    ", we can imagine that the outcome of the measurement is stored in another pointer system , so for an experimenter who has not looked at the information about the outcome of the operation , the experiment can be described by the first stage only ( this is nothing but the model of a standard quantum instrument @xcite , trivially extended to the more general type of operations we consider ) .",
    "any process of learning or discarding of information about the outcome of the operation can be described by a classical operation on the pointer system .",
    "this most generally corresponds to a diagnonal cp map , followed by a renormalization of the overall operation , which results in an operation of a similar form to , but with the pointer states possibly running over a different set .",

    "the diagonal cp map describing the transformation of the pointer has the form @xmath162 where @xmath163 after renormalization , this gives rise to the updated overall operation @xmath164 from this , we infer the general update rule of the operation on the original systems : @xmath165 where @xmath166    it is worth noting a couple of special cases that will be used later .",
    "the case of completely discarding the information about the outcome of the operation corresponds to @xmath167 being a singleton set , and @xmath168 , @xmath169 .",

    "the latter are not part of the opt _ per se _ , but are the subject of the theory that describes the dynamics of physical systems , which we will refer to as the _ mechanics _ ( an opt says what the possible operations are , but not what operations will arise in specific circumstances ) . according to our present understanding of the laws of mechanics , an isolated quantum system undergoes unitary evolution in time driven by a hamiltonian generator , which is the operator of energy .",
    "quantum states are described in terms of physical variables such as momentum , or spin . under time reversal ,",
    "these variables transform in a specific way ( e.g. , energy remains invariant , while momentum and spin change sign ) and this determines the notion of time reversal in a physical sense . as shown by wigner @xcite",

    ". however , this can not be the canonical isomorphism arising from the standard choice of bilinear form because of the physical considerations noted earlier .",
    "the retrodictive states and measurements arise exactly from the canonical isomorphism , up to a constant factor .    under time",

    "it is reasonable to assume , however , that any generalized notion of time reversal would be of the kind , , ( equivalently , , ) so that it would reduce continuously to the standard one in the regimes of standard quantum mechanics .",

    "the minus sign disappears at the level of the operators by means of which we describe states and effects , but its existence at the hilbert - space level is one way of arguing that there has to be a spin superselection rule @xcite .",

    "these observations suggest a point of view according to which an operation represents knowledge about the possible events in a given region , which can be updated upon learning or discarding of information .",
    "if we have a given operation , any subset of the outcomes of that operation would obey the closed - box assumption , because learning whether the outcome belongs to a subset can be done inside a closed box .",
    "however , not all subsets of the outcomes of an operation define a valid operation in the standard formulation of quantum theory .",
    "what is the criterion that defines a given set of events that obeys the closed - box assumption as a valid operation ?    intuitively , one may say that the key distinction between a valid operation and an arbitrary subset of the outcomes of a valid operation is that an operation is something that an experimenter is able to choose ` at will ' .",
    "for example , we think that we could ` choose ' a measurement , but not the outcome of a measurement .",
    "how can we formalize this idea ?",
    "one possible way could be through the notion of a _ freely chosen _ variable as a variable that is uncorrelated from events in the past @xcite . if we adopt this point of view , a valid operation would be one that satisfies the causality axiom @xcite .",
    "but then the axiom would be part of the definition of operation and not an axiom .",
    "however , it is clear that there is some nontrivial physical property that this condition expresses , i.e. , it is regarded as an axiom for a reason .",
    "the fact that theories that allow signaling from the future are considered sensible @xcite further shows that the causality axiom is not the implicit assumption that one makes about what an operation is supposed to mean .",
    "there is another idea that can be said to express the intuition of being able to ` choose ' an operation , which is in principle compatible with signaling to the past , and in the context of which the causality axiom expresses a nontrivial physical constraint .",
    "this is the idea that the variables that define an operation are ( or at least can be ) obtained _ without post - selection _",
    ", i.e. , they can be known before the time of the input system unconditionally on information available in the future .",
    "it is this criterion that is implicitly assumed in the standard approach to quantum theory .",
    "indeed , under this condition the causality axiom captures a nontrivial empirical fact  namely , that out of the larger class of potential operations that we could obtain by selecting sets of events that obey the closed - box assumption , only the class of standard operations can be obtained without post - selection . _ a priori _ ,",
    "the non - standard operations that in practice can only be obtained with post - selection could have been obtainable without post - selection too . the fact that they are not",
    "can be thought of as enforced by the axiom , since adding any of these operations to the class of standard operations would violate the axiom ( the joint probabilities for circuits of such operations can be easily calculated using bayes s theorem ) .",
    "we remark that if we redefine the class of valid operations not only by adding non - standard operations that require post - selection to the standard ones , but also by excluding standard operations , we can obtain a new class that obeys the causality axiom .",

    "<S> the symmetry of quantum theory under time reversal has long been a subject of controversy because the transition probabilities given by born s rule do not apply backward in time . here </S>",
    "<S> , we resolve this problem within a rigorous operational probabilistic framework . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that reconciling time reversal with the probabilistic rules of the theory requires a notion of operation that permits realizations via both pre- and post - selection . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the generalized formulation of quantum theory that stems from this approach and give a precise definition of time - reversal symmetry , emphasizing a previously overlooked distinction between states and effects . </S>",
    "<S> we prove an analogue of wigner s theorem , which characterizes all allowed symmetry transformations in this operationally time - symmetric quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find larger classes of symmetry transformations than those assumed before . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests a possible direction for search of extensions of known physics .    </S>",
    "<S> symmetries play a fundamental role in our understanding of physics . </S>",
    "<S> it is widely believed that the most general symmetry transformations in quantum theory correspond to unitary or anti - unitary transformations on the hilbert space , with symmetries involving time reversal being anti - unitary @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the joint transformation of charge conjugation , parity inversion , and time reversal defined according to this principle , is considered an exact symmetry of all known physical laws @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , it has been recognized that born s rule , which describes the probabilities for the outcomes of future measurements conditional on past preparations , does not apply for events in the reverse order @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in conflict with the very definition of symmetry underlying the above assertions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , since the operational interpretation of a quantum state is directly linked to born s rule @xcite , this raises doubts about whether the commonly accepted notion of time - reversed state makes physical sense .    here </S>",
    "<S> , we address this problem from a rigorous operational perspective @xcite , using the circuit framework for operational probabilistic theories ( opts ) @xcite , which has been shown to successfully formalize the informational foundations of quantum theory @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that reconciling time reversal with the probabilistic rules of the theory requires a generalized notion of operation , defined without assumptions on whether the implementation of an operation involves pre- or post - selection . in this approach </S>",
    "<S> , operations are not expected to be up to the ` free choices ' of agents , but merely describe knowledge about the possible events taking place in different regions , conditional on information obtained locally . </S>",
    "<S> we develop the generalized formulation of quantum theory that stems from this approach and show that it has a new notion of state space that is not convex . </S>",
    "<S> we give a precise definition of time reversal symmetry , taking into account the different nature of states and effects , which has been overlooked in previous treatments . </S>",
    "<S> we prove an analogue of wigner s theorem @xcite , which characterizes all possible symmetry transformations in this time - symmetric formulation of quantum theory . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , we find more general classes of symmetry transformations than those assumed before .    we also identify the time asymmetry ingrained in the standard formulation of quantum theory as the fact that , forward in time , without post - selection we can only prepare a restricted class of all allowed operations , which does not hold backward in time . </S>",
    "<S> we show how this property can be expressed formally in the circuit framework , and that it can be understood as a result of the unitarity of the dynamics in space - time combined with the form of the past and future boundary operations . </S>",
    "<S> we establish an exact link between this asymmetry and the fact that we can remember the past but not the future . </S>"
