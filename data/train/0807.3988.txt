    "inflation is a promising candidate to generate primordial density fluctuations as well as to solve the horizon and the flatness problems .",
    "although many observational supports for the inflationary scenario have been accumulated , it is still unclear what mechanism is really responsible for producing primordial density fluctuations .",
    "we usually assume they are generated by fluctuations of the inflaton , but those of other scalar fields can produce the primordial fluctuations too .",
    "such scalar fields generically exist in the extensions of the standard model of particle physics , which motivates the curvaton scenario @xcite and modulated reheating scenarios @xcite .",
    "one of interesting features of these scenarios is that primordial non - gaussianity can possibly be very large , in contrast to the case of single field inflation models where only the inflaton is responsible for density fluctuations so that almost perfect gaussian fluctuations arise .",
    "therefore , non - gaussianity can be a very powerful tool to identify the real source of the primordial fluctuations .",
    "in fact , there has been reported that non - gaussianity is detected in the cosmic microwave background almost at 3@xmath13 level @xcite although this is not confirmed by the latest wmap 5-year results @xcite .",
    "( see also refs .",
    "@xcite . ) further observations of wmap and future observations such as planck can give us more information on non - gaussianity and serve to discriminate different scenarios .",
    "in most works done thus far on this topic , only one source of the fluctuations has been considered . in general , however , since there exist a lot of scalar fields in a supergravity or superstring theory , different kinds of sources could contribute to the primordial fluctuations simultaneously .",
    "therefore , it is interesting to consider models with mixed fluctuations from the inflaton and other sources . in such mixed scenarios , not only non - gaussianity but also other features of the primordial fluctuations such as the amplitude ,",
    "spectral index and tensor modes are affected in comparison to the case where the inflaton alone is the seed of fluctuations .",
    "current cosmological data are already very precise regarding the scalar spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio and they can severely constrain models of inflation . some models of inflation are considered to have already been excluded @xcite .",
    "for example , chaotic inflation with the higher order polynomial potential is excluded at more than 95% confidence level .",
    "but , such constraints may be evaded by adding another source of fluctuations .",
    "in fact , it is shown that some models of inflation which are disfavored by the data can be liberated by adding the curvaton contribution @xcite .",
    "in particular , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it has been studied in what cases models of inflation can be relaxed by adding fluctuations from the curvaton in some detail assuming some concrete inflation models focusing on the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "furthermore , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was also discussed in what cases / models large non - gaussianity can be generated satisfying the constraints on the scale dependence and tensor modes of primordial fluctuations in the mixed scenario .",
    "the modulated reheating scenario has been paid much attention recently as interesting other source of fluctuations and large non - gaussianity but it is not so rigorously investigated as the curvaton mechanism in particular as regards mixed scenarios with the inflaton . therefore , in this paper , we consider the mixed models where fluctuations from the inflaton and the modulated coupling can both contribute to the present cosmic density fluctuations .",
    "then , we study the effects of the contribution of the modulated coupling on inflationary parameters such as the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio and compare with the wmap 5-year results .",
    "furthermore , we also discuss in what cases large non - gaussianity can be generated satisfying the observational constraints on the scale dependence and tensor modes of primordial fluctuations in such a mixed scenario .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in the next section",
    ", we will give the expressions of the decay rate of the inflaton into radiation for various types of interactions between the inflaton and other fields and for various inflaton potentials , which will be used in the subsequent sections .",
    "in section  [ sec : ne ] , we will provide the @xmath14-folding number from the time when the current cosmological scales crossed the hubble horizon during inflation to the time after the inflaton decays , which enables us to evaluate the curvature perturbations generated in this scenario .",
    "then we give the expressions for the scalar spectral index , tensor - to - scalar ratio and three non - linearity parameters in section  [ sec : observables ] . with the formalism summarized in section  [ sec : observables ] , we work on some specific inflation models to compare the predictions of these inflationary parameters with observations , paying particular attention to in what cases non - gaussianity can be very large . for inflation models which are considered to have already been excluded by the data",
    ", we also give discussions in what case the contribution from the modulated reheating can liberate the model .",
    "the final section is devoted to the conclusion and summary of this paper .",
    "after inflation , the inflaton oscillates around the minimum of its potential and the period of the oscillations is much shorter than the expansion time characterized by the hubble parameter .",
    "the energy density of the universe at that time is stored in the form of oscillation energy of the inflaton .",
    "since the universe should become radiation dominated before the time of big - bang nucleosynthesis , which is required to be consistent with observations , the inflaton must decay into radiation at some time after inflation .",
    "regarding interactions between inflaton and radiation , we consider the following lagrangian , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the inflaton and @xmath17 and @xmath18 are scalar and spinor fields which constitute radiation ( @xmath19 represents the species of the particles ) . in the modulated reheating scenario , the coupling constants @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 are functions of a scalar field which we denote as @xmath13 .",
    "although the number of such scalar fields is not necessarily one , we consider only one modulus to avoid inessential complexity .    the oscillations of the inflaton act as a periodically changing external field on @xmath17 and @xmath18 fields .",
    "this external field creates @xmath17 or @xmath18 particles out of the vacuum . due to the total energy density conservation ,",
    "the energy of created particles are compensated by the loss of the oscillation energy of the inflaton .",
    "hence this process can be regarded as the particle production from the inflaton decay .",
    "let us suppose that the inflaton potential around the minimum can be well approximated by a polynomial form as @xmath22 with @xmath23 being a positive integer . denoting the inflaton energy density as @xmath24 , the decay rate of the inflaton to the lowest order in the coupling constants is given by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the effective mass of the inflaton defined by @xmath27 with @xmath28 being the amplitude of the oscillations . here and hereafter , the subscript @xmath16 of the potential @xmath29 represents the derivative with respect to @xmath16 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are numerical coefficients of @xmath32 .",
    "the explicit values of these are given in the appendix  [ sec : decay ] .",
    "in the following , the @xmath14-folding number especially plays an important role in two aspects .",
    "first of all , when we calculate observables such as the amplitude , spectral index , non - gaussianity and so on of the curvature perturbations , we have to know when the cosmological scales exited the hubble horizon during inflation , i.e. the @xmath14-folding number from the time of horizon crossing during inflation to the present . to this end , we need to know how the universe evolved from the inflationary universe into the standard radiation dominated universe , which obviously requires our knowledge of how the universe is reheated by the inflaton decay .",
    "another aspect is that knowledge of the @xmath14-folding number enables us to calculate the curvature perturbations to any order in the perturbative expansion without invoking complicated perturbed equations but using the so - called @xmath33 formalism @xcite .",
    "all the information regarding various observables of the curvature perturbations is contained in the @xmath14-folding number . in this section , we give an expression for the @xmath14-folding number from the time @xmath34 when the cosmological scale crossed the horizon during inflation to the time @xmath35 when the universe is completely reheated by the inflaton decay .",
    "after @xmath35 , we assume that the universe evolves according to the standard hot big - bang model .",
    "let us denote the @xmath14-folding number from @xmath36 to @xmath35 as @xmath37 . here",
    "@xmath38 and @xmath39 are values of @xmath16 and @xmath13 at @xmath40 . for later convenience ,",
    "we divide @xmath41 into two parts as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the time at the end of inflation .",
    "hence , on the right - hand side , the first term represents the @xmath14-folding number during inflation and the second term remaining one after the inflation . in writing this equation ,",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the mass and vacuum expectation value of the modulus are sufficiently small and the background dynamics during inflation is completely determined by the inflaton alone , which means that the first term on the right - hand side is a function of @xmath44 only .",
    "meanwhile , the second term depends only on @xmath45 .    by using the slow roll approximation",
    ", we write the first term as @xmath46 where @xmath44 and @xmath47 represent the scalar field values at corresponding epochs . to give a more concrete expression for @xmath48 , we need to specify the potential for the inflaton .",
    "let us next consider the second term @xmath49 . when the slow - roll conditions are violated , the inflaton starts to oscillate around its minimum .",
    "after several oscillations , the energy density of the inflaton can be well approximated by that of a perfect fluid with a constant equation of state .",
    "if the potential around the minimum is written as @xmath50 , its energy density decreases as @xmath51 . for the discussion of the curvature perturbations in the next section ,",
    "we further decompose the second term into two parts .",
    "taking @xmath52 as a time after several oscillations of the inflaton but well before the time of decay , @xmath53 can be divided as @xmath54 note that the first term on the right - hand side does not depend on @xmath39 as long as @xmath52 is taken to be sufficiently before the time of the decay . as will become clear later",
    ", @xmath55 is irrelevant to the curvature perturbations .",
    "however , we have to take into account it when we calculate the epoch when the reference scale at present , which is taken to be @xmath56 for our analysis , exited the horizon during inflation . in general , we need a numerical calculation to evaluate @xmath55 and do not discuss this term further here .    regarding @xmath57 , for our discussion in the following , we write it as @xmath58 , \\label{e1 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath59 and @xmath60 are total energy densities of the universe at @xmath52 and @xmath35 respectively .",
    "this equation should be understood as a definition of the function @xmath61 .",
    "note that @xmath61 depends on the variable @xmath62 alone , which can be confirmed by a dimensional analysis of the background evolution equations .",
    "since the dependence of @xmath61 on @xmath63 differs depending on the expansion law of the background space - time , i.e. the power @xmath64 that determines the form of the inflaton potential , and also on the dominant decay channel of the inflaton , we need to follow the background evolution for each case . in principle",
    ", we have to evaluate it by numerical calculations .",
    "however , we can make approximate analytic estimates for @xmath65 when @xmath66 .",
    "we found that @xmath65 can be well approximated with the form @xmath67 where @xmath68 is a numerical constant which depends on the interaction between the inflaton and matter and the potential for the inflaton . in table",
    "[ table ] , the values of @xmath68 are listed for three different powers for the inflaton potential and three different interactions , which are obtained by analytic estimates where the sudden - decay approximation is adopted . the derivation of these analytic values is given in appendix [ sec : app_q ] .",
    "we have also calculated them numerically and found that the differences between analytic estimate and numerical one are at most @xmath69 % for @xmath70 , which can be seen from fig .  [",
    "fig : errorq ] where the relative error for the case with the inflation potential being @xmath71 and three types of interaction listed in table  [ table ] .",
    "& @xmath72&@xmath73&@xmath74 + @xmath75 & @xmath76 & 0 & @xmath77 + @xmath78 & @xmath76 & 0 & @xmath79 + @xmath80 &  & 0 & @xmath81 +    cc    in the following analysis , we consider the cases with @xmath82 and @xmath83 . here",
    "we briefly discuss the tendency of @xmath61 for these cases in order . when @xmath72 , the inflaton potential can be written as @xmath84 . in this case",
    ", we have @xmath85 and the decay rate becomes independent of time for the interactions such as @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "thus we obtain the same value of @xmath61 for these interactions . meanwhile , if the dominant decay occurs through the four - point interaction , the inflaton can not decay completely into radiation simply because the decay rate which is proportional to the hubble parameter squared decreases faster than the hubble parameter . thus in this case , the universe can not be reheated .",
    "hence we do not consider a four - point interaction case for the quadratic potential .",
    "when @xmath73 , @xmath24 behaves the same as the energy density of radiation .",
    "hence the universe expands in exactly the same way as the background space - time even if the decay rate of the inflaton slightly deviates from the background value .",
    "this means that @xmath88 for any interactions . for the case with @xmath74 , since the effective mass @xmath26 changes in time , the decay rate evolves differently for different types of a dominant interaction , which gives a different form of @xmath61 .",
    "also note that since the coefficient of @xmath89 in @xmath65 is negative ( positive ) for @xmath90 , the function @xmath65 itself becomes positive ( negative ) for @xmath91 when @xmath92 . from the definition of @xmath61 ( see eq .",
    "( [ e1 ] ) ) , @xmath61 represents the deviation of the @xmath14-folding number from the radiation dominated universe . because energy density of dust decays more slowly than the radiation energy density , the more dust gives the more @xmath14-folding number until the total energy density decreases to a fixed value , which means the positive @xmath61 .",
    "meanwhile , because the energy density of the inflaton oscillating in the sextic potential decays as @xmath93 , it decreases more rapidly than the energy density of radiation .",
    "hence @xmath61 becomes negative for the sextic potential .    in closing this section , we write down the expression for @xmath94 : @xmath95 , \\label{efold1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which forms the basis in calculating various observables in the subsequent sections .",
    "to calculate the curvature perturbation , we make use of the @xmath33 formalism @xcite . in this formalism , the primordial curvature perturbation @xmath96 on the uniform energy density hypersurface at the time @xmath97 is given by differentiating the @xmath14-folding number @xmath94 in eq .",
    "( [ efold1 ] ) with respect to @xmath38 and @xmath39 , @xmath98 where @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the perturbations of @xmath38 and @xmath39 on the flat slicing . for the purpose of this paper",
    ", we include the terms up to cubic order in the perturbations of scalar fields .",
    "if we choose @xmath35 well after the reheating , then @xmath101 gives primordial adiabatic perturbations .",
    "using @xmath102 , the derivatives of @xmath61 with respect to @xmath13 can be expressed using @xmath103 as @xmath104 here we defined the function as @xmath105 and @xmath106 and denote the derivatives of @xmath103 with respect to @xmath45 as @xmath107 , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 .",
    "when @xmath66 , which we consider in the followings , these functions become almost independent of @xmath63 , namely @xmath61 can be well approximated by @xmath110 ( see table [ table ] ) . in this case , the functions defined above become constant and can be written as @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "the power spectrum @xmath113 of the curvature perturbations is defined by @xmath114 where @xmath115 means that we take connected parts of @xmath116 .    by using eq .",
    ", we can express @xmath117 to the leading order in @xmath118 as @xmath119 where @xmath120 is a slow - roll parameter defined by , @xmath121 furthermore @xmath122 is the square of the ratio of the curvature perturbation from modulated reheating to that from the inflaton , i.e. , @xmath123 .",
    "thus the limit @xmath124 ( @xmath125 ) corresponds to the case where the curvature perturbation is sourced only by the inflaton ( modulus ) fluctuations . for discussion in the following ,",
    "here we give the definition of another slow - roll parameter @xmath126 : @xmath127      the bispectrum @xmath128 is defined by @xmath129 during inflation , both @xmath16 and @xmath13 are slowly - rolling .",
    "it is known that the non - gaussianity of @xmath96 coming from the intrinsic non - gaussianities of @xmath99 and @xmath100 is far below the observational sensitivity .",
    "hence we can treat @xmath130 and @xmath131 as uncorrelated gaussian random fields with the same amplitude .",

    "for example , if the potential is given by a quadratic term , we have @xmath144 ( see table  [ table ] ) , which yields @xmath145 . the non - linearity between @xmath96 and @xmath137 gives the positive ( negative ) @xmath3 for quadratic ( sextic ) inflaton potential .    on the other hand , the second term which represents",
    "the non - gaussianity coming from the non - linearity between @xmath136 and @xmath13 depends on the detailed form of @xmath146 .",
    "we see that very large non - gaussianity @xmath147 can be generated only when @xmath148 is satisfied .",
    "cc    the trispectrum @xmath149 is defined by @xmath150    if we parameterize @xmath149 by the two dimensionless parameters @xmath151 and @xmath1 as @xmath152 then these parameters are given by @xmath153    from eqs .",

    "@xcite , it is shown that this inequality holds in more general setting , i.e. for any cases where the leading non - gaussianity comes from super - horizon evolution .",
    "as for @xmath1 , the non - linearity between @xmath96 and @xmath155 always gives positive values for @xmath1 irrespective of the inflaton potential and the dominant interaction .",
    "when the non - linearity between @xmath137 and @xmath156 can not be neglected , @xmath1 can be negative .",
    "if the @xmath157 term in @xmath1 can be neglected and @xmath158 , all the three non - linear parameters are functions of @xmath159 and @xmath160 .",
    "this means that we have a universal relation among the non - linearity parameters independent of @xmath159 and @xmath161 .",

    "( [ cons ] ) . for comparison",
    ", we also show the relation among the non - linearity parameters which holds for other scenarios which can generate large non - gaussianity such as models with mixed inflaton and curvaton for the case with a large positive @xmath3 @xcite and  ungaussiton \" @xcite .",
    "interestingly , while the curvaton gives negative @xmath1 , the modulated reheating gives positive one ( if the potential is quadratic ) if @xmath3 is large positive .",

    "let us first look at the left panel ( case a ) . in this case , @xmath233 is almost independent of @xmath13 .",

    "this is the reason why the contours are parallel to the @xmath13-axis .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath234 , smaller value of @xmath181 indicates larger @xmath159 , i.e. larger contribution from the modulus fluctuations to the total curvature perturbations .",
    "when the modulus contributions become dominant , the value of @xmath165 shifts from @xmath235 to @xmath236 . for the case",
    "b ( see the top right panel of fig .  [ chao2nsr ] ) , @xmath233 is proportional to @xmath237",
    ". hence the contours are parallel to the line @xmath238 , which can be seen from the figure .",
    "now we investigate how the tensor - to - scalar ratio is modified in the mixed model . in the bottom panels of fig .",

    "we show contours of non - linearity parameters @xmath239 and @xmath1 in the top , middle and bottom panels of fig .",

    "a , we have @xmath240 ( see eq .",
    "( [ decay2 ] ) ) .",
    "hence as in the cases for @xmath165 and @xmath170 , the value of @xmath159 alone determines the effects of the modulus contributions on the non - linearity parameters .",

    "[ chao2_alpham_nl ] , the trends are different . as mentioned before , the non - linearity parameters are governed by the combination @xmath245 , when @xmath185 is small , the dependence of non - linearity parameters on @xmath185 is also small . on the other hand , when @xmath185 is large , the size of the above combination is determined by @xmath185 with @xmath186 being fixed .",
    "thus the predictions are irrelevant to @xmath181 in this case , which can be read off from the figure . in the following ,",
    "we discuss other types of the inflaton potential and again present our results in the @xmath13@xmath181 plane fixing the values of @xmath185 .",
    "however , the trend discussed here also applies to those cases .",
    "cc    cc    cc      cc    cc",
    "next we consider chaotic inflation with the quartic potential . as a simple possibility",
    ", one usually assumes that the quartic term alone exists in the potential for the inflaton .",
    "since the energy density of inflaton oscillations in such a potential decreases in the same way as that of radiation , no fluctuation is generated via modulated reheating scenario as discussed previously .",
    "however , there are some interesting models @xcite where the potential during inflation is given by the quartic form , but the quadratic term becomes effective when the inflaton starts to oscillate .",
    "in fact , this feature comes from the curved trajectory in the multiple fields configuration .",
    "but it can be well characterized by considering a single field with the potential given by the sum of the quadratic term and the quartic one : @xmath247 . above situation",
    "can be realized by taking @xmath248 with @xmath249 being fixed by wmap normalization .",
    "hence we adopt this relation in the following analysis for definiteness . in this case ,",
    "quartic term dominates during inflation ( @xmath250 ) , but the quadratic one dominates after inflation .",
    "this model is also interesting in another aspect . in the absence of the quadratic term ,",
    "we have @xmath88 and the curvature perturbations are not generated by the modulation of the decay rate .",
    "then the curvature perturbations originate solely from the inflaton fluctuations even when the decay rate fluctuates , which is completely ruled out from wmap 5-year data because of the too large tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "however , if we include the quadratic one , the curvature perturbations can be additionally generated when inflaton decays .",
    "if these perturbations dominate the total curvature perturbations , the quartic inflation model may still satisfy the observational constraints , with large amount of the non - gaussianity which could be tested by the future observations .",
    "[ chao24nsr ] show contour plots of @xmath165 and @xmath170 in this case , respectively .",

    "we see that when the modulus contributions become dominant , @xmath165 gets closer to unity and @xmath170 becomes very small . as a result , @xmath251 enters the allowed region of wmap 5-year data .",
    "the slopes of the contours are essentially the same as in the previous case where @xmath84 .    in fig .",
    "[ chao24nl ] , we show the contour plots of the three non - linearity parameters . as for the case",
    "a , there is a large parameter space where @xmath251 is in the allowed region of wmap 5-year data while generating large amount of non - gaussianity @xmath252 which could be tested by the upcoming observations .",
    "cc      let us next consider chaotic inflation model whose potential is given by @xmath254 this model is also completely ruled out by wmap 5-year data if the curvature perturbations solely originate from the inflaton fluctuations .",
    "[ chao6nsr ] show the contour plots of @xmath165 and @xmath170 in this case , respectively .",
    "we see that as in the case of the quadratic and quartic potential , @xmath251 enters the allowed region of wmap 5-year data due to the slight shift of @xmath165 to unity and the significant suppression of @xmath170 when the modulus contributions become dominant .    in fig .",
    "[ chao6nl ] , we show the contour plots of the three non - linearity parameters . for the sextic potential , @xmath3 becomes negatively large when the modulus contributions are dominant , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "if we take @xmath255 instead of @xmath256 , then we have positively large @xmath3 just like the case in the quadratic and quartic potential .    cc",
    "we have investigated a mixed scenario where both fluctuations from the inflaton and modulated reheating are responsible for cosmic density fluctuations today .",
    "first we summarized the decay rate of the inflaton for various interactions and inflaton potentials , whose details are presented in appendix [ sec : decay ] .",
    "then we gave expressions for the spectral index , tensor - to - scalar ratio and non - linearity parameters such as @xmath257 and @xmath1 .",
    "we found that while the non - linearity between @xmath96 and @xmath137 generates @xmath258 , the non - linearity between @xmath136 and the modulus can generate large @xmath259 .",
    "we also derived the consistency relation eq .   among the non - linearity parameters which is applicable for the cases where the decay rate for the inflaton is given as eq .  .",
    "if the potential around the minimum is quadratic , then @xmath1 takes the same sign as @xmath3 .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to the situation where the mixed model of the inflaton and the curvaton yields a negative @xmath260 when @xmath3 is large positive .",
    "we have also studied the inflationary parameters including non - linearity parameters assuming some inflation models . since the new inflation model usually gives a extremely small value of @xmath120 , we have @xmath261 .",
    "thus , the addition of fluctuations from modulated reheating does not significantly change the prediction of the property of fluctuations in the case of new inflation .",
    "therefore , in this paper , we have considered chaotic inflation models with several polynomials and some types of decay rate for an illustrational purpose . in the case with the chaotic inflation model ,",
    "the contribution from fluctuations of modulated reheating makes non - gaussianity larger , the spectral index closer to scale - invariant and tensor - to - scalar ratio more suppressed .",
    "this helps to liberate models of inflation such as the sextic potential one because this model has been excluded by the data because of its too red - tilted spectrum and too large tensor - to - scalar ratio .",
    "the chaotic inflation with quartic potential has also in fact been excluded by the data .",
    "since fluctuations are not generated by modulated reheating in a simple quartic potential case , this model can not be made viable by just adding a contribution from the modulated reheating . however , even if the inflaton is driven by a quartic term , another term such as a quadratic one can become effective during reheating stage after inflation .",
    "this kind of situation can be realized by assuming @xmath262 with @xmath263 , which was discussed in this paper .",
    "in such a case , fluctuations from modulated reheating can affect the total fluctuations and liberate the model .",
    "in addition , non - gaussianity can also be large in this case too .",
    "we have also investigated the case with the quadratic inflation model and showed that non - gaussianity can be large in this model by just adding some contribution from modulated reheating without conflicting the observations of the spectral index and tensor modes .    in most works",
    "so far , observational consequences for various generation mechanisms of primordial fluctuations have been discussed in each separately .",
    "however , different mechanisms can be in general responsible for today s cosmic density fluctuations simultaneously so it is of great importance to investigate a mixed model such as the one we discussed in this paper .",
    "precise cosmological observations expected in the near future to hunt for primordial non - gaussianity may reveal such interesting scenarios in the early universe .",

    "<S> we investigate non - gaussianity in the modulated reheating scenario where fluctuations of the decay rate of the inflaton generate adiabatic perturbations , paying particular attention to the non - linearity parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 as well as the scalar spectral index and tensor - to - scalar ratio which characterize the nature of the primordial power spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we also take into account the pre - existing adiabatic perturbations produced from the inflaton fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> it has been known that the non - linearity between the curvature perturbations and the fluctuations of the decay rate can yield non - gaussianity at the level of @xmath2 , but we find that the non - linearity between the decay rate and the modulus field which determines the decay rate can generate much greater non - gaussianity . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss a consistency relation among non - linearity parameters which holds in the scenario and find that the modulated reheating yields a different one from that of the curvaton model . in particular , they both can yield a large positive @xmath3 but with a different sign of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a possibility to discriminate these two competitive models by looking at the sign of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we work on some concrete inflation models and investigate in what cases models predict the spectral index and the tensor - to - scalar ratio allowed by the current data while generating large non - gaussianity , which may have many implications for model - buildings of the inflationary universe .    </S>",
