    "following the explosion of sn 1987a , a large variety of models were proposed that sought to explain both the light curve and the identification of the presupernova star , sk -69 202 , a blue supergiant .",
    "many of these fell by the wayside as more data were obtained and detailed models constructed . the idea of mass loss as the explanation of a blue star ( e.g. , maeder 1987 ; chevalier & fransson 1987 ; shigeyama et al .",
    "1987 ) failed to explain the long delay before the second light peak and the slow velocity of the ejecta .",
    "sn 1987a , unlike sn 1993j , was not a type iib supernova .",
    "the suggested low metallicity of the lmc offered an explanation of why many blue supernova progenitors might exist ( shklovskii 1987 ; truran & weiss 1987 ; arnett 1987 ; hillebrandt et al .",
    "1987 ) , but , by itself , failed to explain the existence of a nitrogen rich circumstellar shell surrounding the supernova .",
    "this low velocity material was and still is taken as evidence that sk  -69  202 lived for a time as a red supergiant , making the ( last ) transition back to the blue just shortly , about 20,000 years , before its death .",
    "more successful models considered some alteration to the physics of convective mixing , the dredge up of helium by rotation for example ( saio et al . 1988 ; weiss et al .",
    "1988 ; wang 1991 ; langer 1991 , 1992 ) , or altered convective mixing plus low metallicity ( woosley et al . 1988 ; langer et al . 1989",
    "; weiss 1989 ) , or else invoked the effects of close binary membership on the late evolution ( podsiadlowski & joss 1989 ; barkat & wheeler 1989 ; hillebrandt & meyer 1989 ; chevalier & soker 1989 ; de  loore & vanbeveren 1992 ; braun & langer 1995 ) .",
    "the rotational models ( e.g. , saio et al . ) suffered from an _ ad hoc _ prescription for the timing and extent of the mixing process , essentially substituting one puzzle for another ( though , as we shall see later , they _ may _ have been essentially correct ) .",
    "the  restricted semiconvection \" plus low metallicity models ( e.g. , woosley et al .",
    "1988 ) also employed several assumptions that have yet to be proven - that convection follows the ledoux criterion more closely than the schwartzschild and that the lmc is metal poor to the required extent ( a factor of 3 or more in oxygen ) .",
    "but they were still regarded as successful until the complicated ring structure , revealed by space telescope , called all single star models into doubt .",
    "the binary star models suffered perhaps from a too great diversity of possible outcomes and the unavoidable conclusion that sn  1987a was an unusual event , even in the lmc .    today , ten years later , we revisit this subject .",
    "little has been learned about the ( central ) supernova itself that changes our views of the presupernova star .",
    "its light has continued to decline at a steady rate and is currently powered by some combination of @xmath2ti , a compact collapsed remnant , and circumstellar shock interaction , just as was expected .",
    "however , the discovery of the complicated double ring structure and the need to break spherical symmetry prior to the explosion shows that , at minimum , rotational effects must be included and , at a maximum , that sn  1987a was a consequence of binary merger .",
    "the latter possibility is discussed in detail elsewhere ( and in this volume ) by podsiadlowski . here",
    "we will concentrate on single star models . during the last ten years",
    "our understanding of stellar opacities also has improved .",
    "the new opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers , 1996 ) are considerably different from what was used ten years ago and , as we shall see , this has important consequences for sk -69 202 .",
    "it has also become possible to include , in a preliminary way , the effects of rotation on massive stellar evolution and we do so for sk -69 202 for the first time here .    we begin with a brief discussion of what causes a star to become a blue supergiant and then present new calculations of massive star evolution in the mass range 16 to 22 m. these are non - rotating models that employ either solar composition or a composition that might be appropriate to the lmc . the degree of semiconvection is varied , either reduced throughout the star s life or , for some cases ( table 2 ) only after hydrogen burning .",
    "there is no obvious need that the parameters of mixing should be exactly the same on the main sequence and during advanced burning stages .",
    "both , red and blue solutions are obtained and discussed .",
    "next , we consider the modification to these models caused by an appreciable amount of rotation .",
    "rotation leads to mixing , especially in regions of large velocity shear like those at the boundaries of convective shells , and this changes the evolution .",
    "velocity shear also leads to angular momentum transport which is followed in the calculations . for the most part",
    ", rotation suppresses the blue solution and makes it harder to understand sn 1987a .",
    "but in the conclusions , we discuss how additional angular momentum transport by magnetic fields might lead to the appreciable dredge up of helium into the envelope .",
    "this would help make the star blue and also explain large surface abundance enhancements in nitrogen .",
    "it was agreed then and still is that the star that exploded , sk -69 202 , a b3 ia supergiant , had a luminosity of @xmath3 erg s@xmath4 and a radius of @xmath5 cm .",
    "the luminosity implies the helium - core mass was 6 @xmath6 1 m , which if the effects of mass loss , rotation , and overshoot mixing are ignored , corresponds to a mass on the main sequence of 18 - 22 m. for a credible explosion kinetic energy , @xmath7 erg , consistent with the velocity history observed for sn 1987a and the very early light curve , the star must also have had a hydrogen envelope mass around 10 m  in order that the secondary maximum of the light curve occurs at the right time ( e.g. , woosley 1988 ) .",
    "certainly envelope masses below 5 and above 15 m  are excluded .",
    "analysis of the neutrino signal gives a mass for the iron core that collapsed of 1.2 - 1.7 m  ( e.g. , burrows 1988 ) which is reasonable for progenitor helium core masses around 6 m. the inner ring of slow moving nitrogen - rich material alluded to previously also implies that sk -69 202 was a red supergiant for some time before making a transition to a blue star about 20,000 years prior to exploding . while a red supergiant , the star lost at least 0.045 m  ( lundquist & fransson 1996 ) and perhaps as much as several m  ( see elsewhere in these proceedings ) .",
    "the nitrogen enhancements observed in the inner ring are n / c @xmath8 5.0 @xmath6 2.0 ( about 14 times solar ) and n / o @xmath8 1.1 @xmath6 0.4 ( about 10 times solar , lundquist & fransson 1996 ) .",
    "the outer rings also appear to be nitrogen rich though less so by a factor of three indicating ejection at an earlier epoch ( panagia et al .",
    "1996 ) .    in general",
    ", increasing the helium core mass makes it harder to get a blue progenitor .",
    "larger helium cores have larger luminosities to inflate their hydrogen envelopes .",
    "on the other hand a large envelope mass favors a blue solution .",
    "the hydrogen burning shell does not contribute appreciably to the presupernova luminosity , but its mass does add to gravity . making",
    "the low density envelope rich in helium also helps to achieve a blue solution by reducing the opacity and increasing the mean molecular weight .",
    "the envelope will always be enriched in nitrogen and helium if the star has been a red supergiant with a deeply convective envelope , but this mixing can be amplified by rotational effects or perhaps in the common envelope stage of binary merger . reducing the metallicity tends to produce a blue supergiant , both by reducing the envelope opacity and the efficiency of hydrogen shell burning by the cno cycle shortly before the supernova .",
    "obviously , raising the envelope opacity , e.g. , because of new calculations of the relevant atomic physics , also tends to make a red star .",
    "reduced semiconvection helps make a blue solution , in part by decreasing the gravitational potential at the hydrogen burning shell ( lauterborn et al .",
    "1971 ) and by reducing the carbon - oxygen core mass developed by a helium core of given size .",
    "one obvious consequence of these rules is that any process that tends to increase the helium - core mass relative to the hydrogen - envelope mass will tend to make a red supergiant .",
    "examples of such processes are mass loss ( short of removing the entire envelope ) and rotation .",
    "we now present a series of model calculations to illustrate the range of outcomes one might expect for various assumptions regarding the composition , convection , and rotation .",
    "all models in section  3.1 were calculated using the kepler computer code ( weaver , zimmerman , & woosley 1978 ) modified to use , on request , the new opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers , 1996 ) and low - temperature opacities ( alexander & fergusson , 1994 ) .    where a composition appropriate to the lmc was called for , we used 74.6% h , 25% he , 0.052% c , 0.012% n , 0.25%o , 0.056%ne , and 0.08% fe , all by mass .",
    "this is roughly a metallicity of 1/4 solar consistent with the sum of cno being ( 0.30 @xmath6 0.5)% in the inner ring around the supernova ( lundquist & fransson 1996 ) . where used , _",
    "solar _ abundances were from anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) .",
    "the critical reaction rate for @xmath9c(@xmath10)@xmath11o was taken equal to the caughlan & fowler ( 1988 ) value except where otherwise noted .",
    "mass loss rates , where included , were from nieuwenhuijzen et al .",
    "( 1990 ) scaled by a factor ( z@xmath12/z)@xmath13 with z@xmath14 for the lmc models .",
    "table 1 gives the results for a variety of stellar models .",
    "all of these models used  restricted semiconvection \" in the sense of woosley et al .",
    "( 1988 ) . that is the mixing criterion ,",
    "while not quite ledoux , did use a small value of semiconvective mixing coefficient , @xmath15 = 10@xmath16 throughout the evolution ( here @xmath15 is a multiplier on the diffusion coefficient used for transporting composition ; d@xmath17 @xmath8",
    "@xmath15d@xmath18 ) .",
    "this is to be contrasted with the standard value used e.g. , in woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) , of 0.1 .",
    "we call the latter here  full semiconvection \" . if there is an entry for @xmath19 , the star died with a surface temperature over 10,000  k and this was the time spent that way following the latest episode as a rsg .",
    "an accompanying entry for @xmath20 is then the time spent with surface temperature less than 5,000  k _ prior to this last blue stage _ or prior to the sn explosion , if there was no such blue stage .",
    "the lifetimes may sum to much less than the helium burning lifetime , about @xmath21  yr in all cases , if the star experienced a blue loop or spent an extended period burning helium in the blue before becoming red .",
    "we see that using the old opacities - the same as in the code ten years ago - blue solutions are still obtained for 18 , 20 , and 22 mstars . the 18 m  model ( for zero mass loss )",
    "is blue much too long before the explosion .",
    "the inner ring would be much farther out than observed . in the case of the 20 and 22 m  models evolved without mass loss ,",
    "the final red state just before the last transition to the blue is short , a feature not emphasized in previous discussions .",
    "each star actually spends several hundred thousand years as a rsg burning helium , but has an extended blue loop that  resets the clock \" insofar as table 1 is concerned .",
    "the short last red phase might eject as much as @xmath00.1 m  which might be enough to explain the inner ring , or at least that position visible so far , but it is expected that the actual mass in the ring is much larger ( mccray , these proceedings ) .",
    "the star most like the earlier calculations of woosley and weaver is the 22 m  model that includes mass loss ( de jager , nieuwenhuijzen , & van der hucht 1985 ) .",
    "this loss suppresses the blue loop and the star spends most of its helium burning lifetime as a rsg then moves to the blue a proper 20,000 years before exploding . for the other models the implication of a previous rsg phase with lots of mass loss followed by a blue wind then a red wind then a blue wind have yet to be explored , but might be related to the complicated inner and outer ring structure .",
    ".new models  no rotation [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,>,^ \" , ]     a series of rotating models were calculated using the gttingen stellar evolution code ( table  4 ) .",
    "this had a similar , though not identical treatment of semiconvection to the `` restricted '' cases done with kepler and a similar treatment of mass loss ( cf .",
    "langer et al .",
    "the assumed starting model was rigidly rotating on the main sequence with an equatorial velocity given in table 4 .",
    "angular momentum transport was treated as described in langer et al .",
    "( 1997 ; see also endal & sofia 1976 , 1978 , 1981 ; pinsonneault et al . 1989 ) and included terms for convection , semiconvection , eddington sweet circulation , the solberg - hoiland instability , as well as secular and dynamic shear instability .",
    "although the transport of angular momentum is treated in diffusion approximation , convective regions tended to rotate rigidly , because the convective turnover time - scale is usually small in comparison to the live - time of convective regions and the time - scale on which the convective region changes its properties , e.g. its density structure and total angular momentum .",
    "sample model results at carbon depletion are given in table 4 for two rotating 18  m  stars ( the zero rotation case is also given for comparison ) .",
    "both rotating stars developed deep convective envelopes and had large helium and nitrogen enhancements .",
    "however , both ended up as red supergiants .",
    "the main culprit here is the growth of the helium core ( figure 4 ) due to additional rotationally induced mixing ( langer et al .",
    "a larger helium core implies a bigger luminosity which is bad enough , but the larger luminosity also causes more mass loss .",
    "both effects make a blue solution difficult .",
    "our conclusions here are mostly negative - without incredibly large decreases in metallicity , the new opacities preclude an acceptable blue solution for sk -69 202 even if the old treatment of restricted semiconvection is used . using restricted semiconvection only after hydrogen burning gives more acceptable results , but the surface abundances of n and he remain problematic . a moderate amount of rotation and a reasonable - but poorly understood - prescription for angular momentum transport gives the desired deep mixing , but too large helium cores to make a blue progenitor .",
    "before surrendering the possibility of a single star solution , however , and accepting that sn  1987a was a very improbable event , we consider another possibility - that rotation was the cause of the ring structure , the abundance anomalies in the rings , and the blue progenitor .    our rotating presupernova stars ( fig .",
    "4 ) end up with very large velocity shears at the outer edge of the helium core .",
    "inclusion of magnetic fields , or other mixing mechanisms not considered so far ( acheson 1978 , spruit & phinney 1997 ) , might lead to additional helium being dredged up into the envelope .",
    "some kind of additional angular momentum transport is indicated because the continued evolution of these stars , using the same angular momentum transport scheme , ends up making iron cores with 100 times the specific angular momentum of the crab pulsar ( heger , woosley , & langer 1997 ) .",
    "while we can provide no models at the present time , any mechanism that reduced the helium core while simultaneously increasing helium in the envelope would tend strongly towards a blue solution . whether this would naturally occur 20,000 years prior to",
    "the explosion remains to be demonstrated ( see also , e.g. , saio et al .",
    "1988 ) .",
    "a rotating rsg with a deeply convective envelope that moved back to the blue would also concentrate a large fraction of the angular momentum in the outer few hundredths of a solar mass ( heger & langer 1997 ) .",
    "this would lead to near keplerian motion in the outer layers and asymmetry in the mass loss . of special interest",
    "is the _ first _ time this occurs for stars which experience blue loops , as many of our models do .",
    "whether this asymmetry could be enough to explain the complex outer ring structure is unknown , at least it might be an explanation for the inner ring , but we consider the single star models for sn  1987a worthy of continued study .",
