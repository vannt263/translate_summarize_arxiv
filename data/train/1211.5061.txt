    "the problem of precise measurement of parton distribution functions ( pdf ) is yet to be solved for the energy scales relevant to the lhc results . on the other hand ,",
    "precison knowledge on the parton distribution of small @xmath6 and sufficiently large @xmath7 is crucial for enlightening the qcd basics at all levels , from partons to nuclei . besides",
    ", with the recent discovery of the 125 gev scalar particle @xcite , @xcite at the lhc , the basic components of the electroweak part of the standard model ( sm ) have been completed .",
    "hovewer , the higgs mechanism provides less than 2% of mass of the visible universe .",
    "remaining 98% are provided by the qcd part of the sm . therefore , clarifying of the basics of the qcd is important for a better understanding of our universe .",
    "that s why the qcd explorer was proposed ten years ago ( see review @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "one of the required measurements is the gluon pdf for low momentum fraction : small @xmath0 .",
    "the last machine that has probed @xmath0 was hera which had a reach of about @xmath8@xmath9 .",
    "large hadron - electron collider ( lhec ) project @xcite - the most powerful microscope ever designed - will provide a unique opportunity to probe extremely small @xmath0 region . in this project , where proton - electron collisions are aimed the @xmath10 can be obtained from a new circular or linear machine .    today , lr option is considered as the basic one for the lhec @xcite .",
    "actually this decision was almost obvious from the beginning due to the complications in constructing by - pass tunnels around the existing experimental caverns and installing the @xmath11 in the already commissioned tunnel .",
    "let us remind that the cdr stage of the lhc assumed also @xmath3 collisions using the already existed lep ring ; but it turned out that lhc installation required dismantling of lep from the tunnel .    within the linac - ring option of the lhec ,",
    "a proton beam from lhc can be hit with a high energy electron or photon beam .",
    "the photons may be virtual ones from the electron beam resulting in a typical dis event or these can be real photons originating from the compton back scattering process . in the latter case ,",
    "the photon spectrum consists of the high energy photons peaking at about 80% of the electron beam energy on the continuum of weizsacker - williams photons .",
    "the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of a small @xmath0 measurement with such a machine .",
    "main parameters of @xmath3 and @xmath4 options of the lhec are presented in section 2 .",
    "section 3 is devoted to investigation of small @xmath0 region using the processes @xmath4 @xmath12 @xmath13 and @xmath4 @xmath12 @xmath14 .",
    "the generator level results are obtained using comphep @xcite software package .",
    "comparison with processes @xmath3 @xmath12 @xmath15 and @xmath3 @xmath12 @xmath16 shows an obvious advantage of the lhec @xmath4 option , which will provide more than one order higher cross sections at small @xmath0 region comparing to the @xmath3 option .",
    "finally , section 4 , provides a summary of the conclusion together with some suggestions .",
    "it should be emphasized that real @xmath4 collisions can be achieved only on the base of linac ring type @xmath3 colliders ( see review @xcite for history and status of linac - ring type collider proposals ) .",
    "real @xmath17 beam for @xmath4 collider @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite will be produced using the compton back scattering of laser beam off the high energy electron beam @xcite , @xcite .",
    "possible application of this mechanism to the other lhec option under consideration , namely to ring - ring type @xmath3 colliders results in negligible @xmath4 luminosities , @xmath18@xmath19@xmath20",
    ".    currently , two versions for the @xmath3 option of the lhec are under consideration : multi - pass energy recovery linac ( erl ) yielding @xmath21@xmath22@xmath23@xmath24 and pulsed single pass linac yielding @xmath25@xmath26@xmath27@xmath24 . in the first case",
    ", @xmath28 has been chosen as a base electron energy , since higher energies are not available because of the synchrotron radiation loss in the arcs . in the second case",
    ", beam energies above @xmath29 would be available @xcite .",
    "these two options will be denoted as lhec-1 and lhec-2 .",
    "main parameters of the lhec @xmath3 collisions , in different options are presented in table 1 .",

    "measurements of @xmath0 down to @xmath5 seem to be reachable in @xmath4 collisions which is two order smaller than the hera coverage .",
    "these collisions provide higher cross section and better @xmath0 reach with respect to the @xmath3 collisions with the same electron beam energy . for the low @xmath0 region ,",
    "the enhancement factor compared to the dis @xmath3 collisions is about 700 for @xmath1 final states and about 230 for @xmath2 final states at the lhec-2 .",
    "therefore , for the final states with heavy quarks , even if the @xmath4 luminosity is 10 times smaller than @xmath3 luminosity ( erl option ) , the expected number of events in @xmath4 collisions would be 70 and 20 times higher than in @xmath3 collisions for @xmath1 and @xmath2 final state respectively .",
    "the enhancement factor compared to wwa @xmath3 collisions is about 24 for both final states .",
    "the angular sensitivity is very important for smallest @xmath0 reach for either @xmath33 or @xmath17 beams , therefore a detector with a pseudorapidity coverage up to @xmath34 is required .",
    "this coverage is already achieved at the atlas and cms experiments using forward detector components .",
    "finally , @xmath3 option of lhec will give an opportunity to shed light on the small @xmath0 dynamics which is crucial for clarifying the qcd basics .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath4 option of lhec will essentially enlarge the lhec capacity on the subject .",
    "therefore , one pulse linac should be considered as a baseline for lhec design . in this case , a higher center of mass energies can be achieved by lengthening of the electron linac which will provide an opportunity to investigate smaller @xmath0 region .",
    "the luminosity loss can be compensated using energy recovery linac without re - circulating arcs @xcite which may provide luminosity values exceeding @xmath35@xmath36@xmath23@xmath24 even with a multi - hundred gev electron linac .    10 atlas collaboration , g. aad et al . , _ combined search for the standard model higgs boson using up to 4.9 @xmath37of @xmath38 collision data at @xmath39 with atlas detector at the lhc , phys .",
