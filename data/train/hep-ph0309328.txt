    "we discussed predictions for fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos produced through pion production of uhecrs during propagation , and for fluxes produced by agn .",
    "we showed that extragalactic top - down scenarios can not contribute significantly to the observed ultra - high energy cosmic ray flux if standard evolution histories and injection spectra are used .",
    "the z - burst mechanism where ultra - high energy neutrinos produce cosmic rays via interactions with relic neutrinos is ruled out except if cosmological neutrino mass limits are invalid and/or if relic neutrinos cluster more strongly than expected based on standard phase space principles .",
    "only the case of maximal neutrino mass @xmath79ev consistent with large scale structure and cmb observations is only moderately excluded .",
    "the fact that a good part of the speculative scenarios of uhecr origin are now ruled out makes the enigma of the highest energy particles an even more exciting subject of study in our opinion .",
