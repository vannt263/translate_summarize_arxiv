    "a standard observing sequence consisted of five consecutive images of 60 seconds for aql x1 ; the position of the object on the array was moved between exposures , so that the group could be median - stacked to produce a sky frame .",
    "the images were processed by first running a simple interpolation program to remove bad pixels .",

    "the x - ray delay observed in the outburst of aql x1 is analogous to the well known uv delay observed for dwarf novae ( warner 1995 , and references therein ) . for dwarf",
    "novae the rise in the uv flux starts about 5 - 15 hours after the beginning of the optical outburst . in the framework of the standard disc instability model ( dim ) one can interpret the uv delay as due to an `` outside - in '' outburst . according to the dim ( _ e.g. _ cannizzo 1993 , and references therein ) , a thermal instability in the outer disc creates a heating front which propagates inward .",
    "this front transforms the disc from a cold ( quiescent ) state to a hot state .",
    "because the uv flux is mainly emitted close to the white dwarf , one expects a delay in its rise equal to the time it takes the front to travel from the outer disc to the white dwarf . in the dim , however , the calculated travel time of the front is much shorter than the observed uv delay time ( @xmath0 1 day ; pringle , verbunt & wade 1986 ; cannizzo & kenyon 1987 ) .",
    "thus , in this standard form the model fails to explain the uv delay .",
    "two solutions have been proposed in order to rescue the dim , both of which invoke a central hole in the accretion disc .",
    "an inward moving heating front would have to stop at the edge of such a hole ; the hole would then fill up on a viscous timescale , which is much longer than the heat front propagation time .",
    "livio & pringle ( 1992 ) suggested a mechanism for creating such a hole involving the magnetic field of a weakly magnitized white dwarf , which can disrupt the inner accretion disc .",
    "they showed that such a model can reproduce the uv - delay observed in dwarf novae outbursts .",
    "meyer & meyer - hofmeister ( 1994 ) proposed a different scheme for quiescent accretion onto a white dwarf that also results in a central hole .",
    "they invoke inefficient cooling in the disc s upper layers , leading to the formation of a hot corona and ultimately to the evaporation of the inner disc .",
    "whether a hole is created by magnetic fields or by evaporation , the effect on the outburst of a dwarf novae is similar .",
    "when the heating front arrives at the inner edge of the truncated disc it can not propagate any further ; the ( surface ) density contrast slowly fills up the hole on a viscous timescale , thereby producing the required delay of the uv outburst .",
    "our photometry suggests that the instability that formed the august 1997 outburst started in the outer regions of the disc and propagated inwards ( an `` outside - in '' event ) , since the brightening started in the @xmath2-band first and then later in x - rays .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field of the neutron star in aql x1 has never been determined from observations , although it is believed to be weak , as inferred from the lack of any detectable pulsed x - ray flux in its persistent emission .",
    "it is easily conceivable that a hole could be created in the accretion disc , either by the weak magnetic field of the neutron star or by quiescent x - rays ( @xmath24 ergs  s@xmath4 ; see verbunt et al .",
    "1994 ) evaporating the inner regions of the disc . therefore , as in the case for dwarf novae",
    ", one can reproduce the observed time delay between the start of the optical and x - ray outburst .",
    "the fact that aql x1 has a binary separation 25 percent larger than typical dwarf novae may explain why the ir  x - ray lag in aql x1 is longer than the optical - uv lag in the dwarf novae .",
    "detailed computations would be required to see if the 3-day delay between the ir and x - rays can be explained by the dim model .",
    "recently narayan , mcclintock & yi ( 1996 ) have proposed a model for the quiescent state of the black hole transients . in the inner region of this model",
    "the flow is advection - dominated , _",
    "i.e. _ it is hot and optically thin and most of the thermal energy is transported across the event horizon , thereby greatly reducing the observed luminosity for the given accretion rate .",
    "this is because at these temperatures the radiative cooling timescale is significantly lower than the infall timescale ( narayan et al 1996 ) . for a neutron star system such as aql x1 this energy",
    "would eventually be radiated from the neutron star surface .",
    "the difference between the black hole and neutron star cases has been cited by narayan , garcia & mcclintock ( 1997 ) as evidence for the nature of the compact object .    the key point for aql x1",
    "is that the advection - dominated accretion flow ( adaf ) region would in effect act as a `` hole '' in the middle of the disc , since the standard thin disc would be truncated at the edge of the advection - dominated flow .",
    "the inner disc becomes advection - dominated at the end of the _ previous _ outburst when the accretion rate drops below a certain level .",
    "we can then estimate the delay we would expect to see by scaling the delay observed in gro  j1655 - 40 to that in aql x1 .",
    "the @xmath25  day delay seen in gro  j1655 - 40 can be modelled as the diffusion of the inner edge of the disc to the black hole , starting at @xmath26 cm ( hameury _ et al .",
    "the fwzi of the h@xmath19 emission profile is @xmath01500  km  s@xmath4 , so for aql x1 , @xmath27 cm . if the diffusion rate is the same , we would expect a delay of @xmath28  days ( garcia 1998 ) ; this compares well with the observed time delay between our ir and x - ray light curves .",
    "we now address the observed x - ray properties of aql x1 , one of only two neutron star sxts ( the other is cen x4 ) and with a very short outburst recurrence time ( typically a year or less ) . in 1997 outbursts were observed in aql x1 in feb . and aug .",
    ", the latter of which has been discussed herein .",
    "the former outburst was the subject of a more detailed xte study by zhang , yu & zhang ( 1998 ) .",
    "in particular , zhang _ et al .",
    "_ found that the x - ray spectral behaviour ( as evidenced by its hardness ratio ) of aql x1 was constant through the decline until just before it entered quiescence , at which point the spectrum hardened dramatically ( see fig .",
    "3 ) .    zhang _",
    "interpreted this spectral change in terms of the `` propeller '' effect .",
    "this effect has been proposed by stella , white & rosner ( 1986 ) to account for the cessation of x - ray emission from rapidly spinning pulsars in be systems when the mass transfer drops below a certain threshold .",
    "this is due to matter entering the rapidly spinning magnetosphere , at which radius the rotation speed exceeds the keplerian speed and hence the matter is ejected rather than accreted .",
    "_ propose that aql x1 is a spun - up pulsar with a weak magnetic field which exhibits the propeller effect when the accretion rate is sufficiently low .",
    "note that khz qpos have now been clearly seen by cui et al .",
    "( 1998 ) during the rising phase of the february 1998 outburst .",
    "if the x - ray light curves and spectral properties of other sxts are examined carefully ( e.g. chen , shrader , & livio 1997 ) , then very similar spectral changes at the same stage are seen in a0620 - 00 , gs  1124 - 683 and gs  2000 + 25 , all of which are ( dynamically ) established black hole systems in which this mechanism could * not * take place .",
    "we also note that this spectral change occurs somewhat after the secondary maximum in the light curve .",
    "this is true of the other systems as well , but the observations are too sparse to demonstrate any systematic effect in this delay .",
    "there is some evidence for a secondary maximum in the asm / pca light curves at @xmath018 days after the outburst peak . in fig .",
    "3 we show the x - ray light curves of gs  1124 - 683 and aql x1 .",
    "in addition to the propeller effect , we propose that other properties of the sxts can be called upon to account for the spectral hardening .",
    "it occurs late in the outburst , after the secondary maximum , the point at which the outer irradiated regions of the disc have been accreted and so , barring the provision of substantial additional material from the secondary , the rate of accretion will be declining .",
    "this will provide an opportunity for the remaining inner disc material to be evaporated by the x - radiation , thereby producing the inner hot , low density region which can lead to an adaf and hence a spherical flow onto the neutron star with a dramatic change in spectrum ( but note that being a neutron star system , the accreted luminosity is of course then radiated as it hits the surface ) .",
    "we have determined a 3 day delay between the ir and x - ray rise times , analogous to the uv - optical delay seen in dwarf novae outbursts and black hole x - ray transients .",
    "we interpret this delay as an `` outside - in '' outburst , in which a thermal instability in the outer disc propagates inward .",
    "we suggest that an adaf region was created at the end of the previous outburst .",
    "the evidence for this comes from the observed hardening of the x - ray spectrum as the system declined into quiescence , a hardening which is also seen in the black hole soft x - ray transients .",
    "this adaf region would appear as a `` hole '' in the inner accretion disc , thereby causing the x - ray - ir delay when the system starts its next outburst ; the hole is needed in order to explain the observed x - ray ",
    "we would like to thank andy stephens for assisting with the early stages of the ir data analysis , and ray bertram for performing some of the ir observations .",
    "we also thank miquel serra for supporting the service observations of the iac80 and tim naylor for obtaining the ukirt images .",
    "jc acknowledges support by the spanish ministry of science grant pb 1995 - 1132 - 02 - 01 .",
