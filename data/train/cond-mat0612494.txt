    "recent systematic studies @xcite of current transmission through quantum dot ( qd ) embedded into an arm of an aharonov ",
    "bohm interferometer @xcite , uncovered an unusual , correlated behaviour of transmission phase as a function of the gate voltage .",
    "namely , between any two consecutive coulomb blockade peaks the transmission phase suffers one abrupt change ( phase lapse ) of @xmath0 .",
    "this surprising feature can not be understood within the framework of a non - interacting qd model @xcite , where the presence or absence of a phase lapse between the two transmission peaks is determined by the relative signs of the tunnelling matrix elements coupling the corresponding qd levels to the leads .",
    "roughly speaking , two adjacent peaks are separated by a phase lapse as long as the product of the four matrix elements , coupling each of the two levels to the two leads , is positive @xcite .",
    "since experimentally there is no way to control these signs in a typical qd @xcite , this would suggest an approximately 50% probability of the presence of a phase lapse between the two consecutive peaks , in disagreement with experimental data .",
    "this dictates that the coulomb ( charging ) interaction between electrons in the qd must be accounted for at some level @xcite .",
    "earlier investigations @xcite of the interaction effects in qds resulted in the notion of `` population switching '' between the broad ( strongly coupled to the leads ) and narrow dot levels with varying gate voltage ( or equivalently , with varying chemical potential ) .",
    "this phenomenon , which subsequently attracted attention of both theorists @xcite and experimentalists ( see , _",
    "reference @xcite ) , consists in the narrow levels being shifted upward due to the coulomb potential of electrons accumulated at a broad level , which remains near the fermi energy ( `` hovers '' ) over an extended range of the gate voltage / chemical potential values . within the latter range , successive narrow levels from time to time",
    "get rapidly filled with electrons ( thereby emptying the broad level , hence the term `` population switching '' @xcite ) and shift downward below the fermi level .",
    "available results @xcite suggest that this switching may be either continuous or discontinuous , although no systematic study of the two scenarios has been performed .",
    "we note that already in references @xcite mean field approach ( self - consistent hartree approximation ) has been employed . apart from reference @xcite , where a qd with only one lead was considered ,",
    "these early studies were all concerned with models where the absolute values of the tunnelling coupling of each individual level to the right and left lead were the same ( `` left - right symmetry '' ) .",
    "it is probably due to the latter circumstance that for a long time no attention has been paid to another generic interaction - induced mechanism which affects both the energy level structure and the transmission phase behaviour in an interacting qd .",
    "this mechanism , which is not effective in the opposite - sign left - right symmetric - coupling case _ only _ , in the context of more conventional solid state physics corresponds to forming excitonic correlations between different bands @xcite . within the mean - field approach to interacting qds @xcite ,",
    "a similar scenario consists in forming the off - diagonal average values between the qd states , leading to interaction - induced hybridisation between the dot energy levels .",
    "we note that the importance of considering the generic , right - left asymmetric dot - lead coupling values was pointed out independently in reference @xcite",
    ".    for the case of a strongly - interacting qd in the coulomb blockade regime one finds that even a small right - left asymmetry typically results in a large effective hybridisation ( again in analogy with conventional impurity problems @xcite ) , leading in turn to a change of the coupling sign for the effective dot levels ( `` minus '' changed to `` plus '' ) , and to a presence of phase lapse between the two transmission peaks .",
    "these findings , reported earlier in reference @xcite , are in line with recent functional renormalisation group results obtained for both two - level @xcite and multi - level @xcite interacting dots .",
    "we also note the recent perturbative treatment @xcite and treatments based on the renormalisation group / bethe _ ansatz _ approach @xcite .    in the present article ,",
    "we investigate transmission through a qd in the spinless case at zero temperature .",
    "we begin by describing the behaviour of transmission phase for multi - level non - interacting dot in section [ sec : nonint ] .",
    "the mean - field approach to an interacting two - level qd is formulated in section [ sec : model ] .",
    "the remainder of the paper is devoted to illustrating and discussing _ the two mechanisms , whose interplay brings about the abrupt changes of the transmission phase ( as a function of the gate voltage or chemical potential ) between the coulomb blockade peaks_. first , in section [ sec : exciton ] we discuss the `` excitonic '' restructuring of the qd spectrum , operational in the presence of a right - left asymmetry .",

    "while our analysis here is far from being comprehensive , it allows to draw three important conclusions :    \\(i ) phase lapses represent a generic property of transmission through qds . in other words ,",
    "the transmission amplitude @xmath1 vanishing at certain values of the chemical potential or the gate voltage ( at which point @xcite the value of the transmission phase jumps by @xmath0 ) does not impose any restrictive condition on the qd parameters .",
    "we quote reference @xcite for an analysis of what is often perceived as a contradiction between this statement and the friedel sum rule .",
    "\\(ii ) as mentioned in the introduction , in the non - interacting case the location of phase lapses with respect to transmission peaks is crucially affected by the relative signs of tunnelling matrix elements coupling the qd levels to the right and left leads @xcite .",
    "in particular , a necessary ( but possibly not always sufficient ) condition for a single phase lapse to occur between the two successive dot levels ( corresponding to the two successive transmission peaks ) is that the product of the tunnelling matrix elements coupling the two corresponding levels to the two leads is negative ( we stress that this can be severely modified in the presence of electron - electron interactions and an asymmetric qd - lead coupling , see sections [ sec : exciton ] and [ sec : switching ] below ) .",
    "\\(iii ) beyond the above conclusion , the actual distribution of transmission zeroes with respect to the dot levels strongly depends on the values of the qd parameters , and this dependence can be rather complex .",
    "other analyses of the transmission phase in the absence of interaction @xcite have demonstrated that disorder or geometry alone would not give rise to sequences of correlated inter - resonance phase lapses .",
    "the latter may however result from a presence of a very broad dot level @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a generic non - interacting dot with @xmath2 levels @xmath3 ( see figure [ fig : schemedot ] ) is given by @xmath4 the dot is coupled to a one - dimensional wire @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 is half bandwidth and the half - integer index @xmath7 labels the sites in the wire ) ,     the model system , composed of a wire ( chain ) and a two - level dot , equations ( [ eq : wire][eq : gendot ] ) .",

    "the second term on the r. h. s. in equation ( [ eq : tunnel2 ] ) corresponds to cutting the link between sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 of the wire .",
    "it is instructive to consider the system with varying perturbation strength , @xmath17 , @xmath18 ( figure [ fig : schemedot ] ) .",
    "while for @xmath19 this corresponds to a fully coupled dot ( no direct hopping between right and left leads ) , characterised by a certain sequence of transmission peaks and transmission phase lapses , at @xmath20 one recovers a featureless transmission amplitude , @xmath21 ( hence @xmath22 ) , of the decoupled case ( unperturbed wire ) .",
    "as @xmath17 increases from 0 to 1 , the profile of @xmath23 evolves between these two limiting cases .",
    "when searching for an eigenfunction @xmath24 which away from the dot has the form of a left - moving , partially reflected wave , @xmath25 ( where @xmath1 and @xmath26 are transmission and right - right reflection amplitudes respectively ) one has to solve a system of @xmath27 linear equations for the quantities @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and the values @xmath30 , @xmath31 of the wave function on the dot levels ( these correspond to the schrdinger equation @xmath32 written for the wire sites @xmath33 and for the dot levels ) .",
    "zeroes of the transmission coefficient @xmath1 ( at @xmath34 ) obviously coincide with those of the principal determinant @xmath35 of this linear system .",

    ", we find @xmath41 .",
    "thus , ( i ) the direction in which the transmission zero is shifted with respect to the corresponding dot level @xmath3 is determined solely by the sign of the product of the tunnelling elements , @xmath42 .",
    "we thus find that whenever all such signs are the same , each inter - level energy interval has exactly one transmission zero , whereas otherwise there arise intervals which contain either two such zeroes or none at all .",
    "( ii ) not counting the spurious zero at @xmath43 , there are exactly @xmath2 transmission zeroes . at @xmath44 ,",
    "each zero approaches the corresponding level @xmath3 , cancelling its transmission peak and thereby restoring the featureless @xmath45 [ and @xmath23 ] at @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48  _ fully coupled dot_. as the value of @xmath17 increases , the transmission zeroes move further away from their corresponding dot levels . while at a finite @xmath17 they obviously can not cross any of the dot levels to drift into neighbouring inter - level intervals , in those intervals which contain pairs of zeroes the zeroes may meet and disappear from the real energy axis ; likewise , new pairs of zeroes may appear in some inter - level intervals .",
    "in addition , one or more zeroes which at smaller @xmath17 may have been located below the lowest dot level or above the highest one may now move out of the conduction band . in the fully coupled case of @xmath8 ,",
    "the r.  h.  s. of equation ( [ eq : determinant ] ) is proportional to the polynomial of the power @xmath49 , which guarantees that the maximal possible number of transmission zeroes is @xmath49 ; this number increases to @xmath2 for @xmath50 [ it follows that at @xmath48 a transmission zero located outside the dot energy range must move out of the conduction band along the real energy axis ] . when the two adjacent levels are characterised by the same signs @xmath51 , it is certain that there is a transmission zero ( or possibly an odd number of zeroes ) between them ; otherwise there may be either two zeroes ( or , in principle , an even number of zeroes ) or none .",
    "it appears that the possibility to have more than two zeroes in any inter - level interval requires a fine - tuning of the parameters of qd , and can not be considered as generic . barring these special cases",
    ", we see that had we compared this unrealistic non - interacting scenario to the experimentally observed correlated occurrence of exactly one transmission zero between every two adjacent dot levels , this would indeed require all the level coupling signs , @xmath52 , to be the same .    furthermore , when at @xmath8 for one of the dot levels @xmath3 the quantity @xmath53 is much smaller than the energy distances to the neighbouring levels , such a weakly coupled level is approached by a single transmission zero at @xmath54^{-1}.\\ ] ] we note that in this case , the direction from which the transmission zero would approach is not determined solely by @xmath52 .    finally , for reference purposes we quote the full expression for the transmission coefficient of a generic dot as given by equation ( [ eq : gendot ] ) , @xmath55 \\left\\ { { \\rm i } ( 2\\lambda -\\lambda^2 - 2)t   \\sqrt{t^2-\\mu^2 } \\begin{array}{c}\\mbox{}\\\\ \\mbox { } \\\\ \\mbox { } \\end{array } \\right.- \\nonumber \\\\ -\\lambda^2 \\sum_{i=1}^{m_d}\\frac{(a^{(i)}_l)^2 t+(a^{(i)}_r)^2",

    "the directions and rates of these shifts reflect the differences in the coupling signs @xmath52 and coupling magnitudes .",
    "while for all values of @xmath17 there is exactly one phase lapse between @xmath78 and @xmath79 and none between @xmath79 and @xmath80 , the pair of phase lapses located between @xmath81 and @xmath78 approach each other , as shown by the dashed - dotted line ( @xmath82 ) .",

    "as will be discussed in more detail below , the typical situation in the large - u case is that , due to large values of @xmath169 in equation ( [ eq : mfew ] ) , @xmath128 is strongly renormalised in the relevant energy region around the phase lapse .",

    "this decreases the level overlap and hence the ability of the system to form @xmath169 and thereby renormalise @xmath128 . at the same time , the energy gain associated with larger @xmath128 in the partially - filled region becomes smaller .",
    "thus the coupling sign change does not occur for a relatively narrow `` red '' region ( `` phase '' 2 ) around the @xmath205 line in figure [ fig : phadiag ] , where the phase lapse of @xmath0 is located outside the energy interval between the two transmission peaks , @xmath209 .",

    "the area occupied by `` phase''2 becomes smaller with increasing @xmath207 or @xmath210 ; it is located below the line denoting the sign change @xmath211 .",
    "this `` excitonic '' mechanism also breaks down when approaching the @xmath212 line .",
    "the reason for this is clear from figure [ fig : schemedot2l ] : at @xmath213 , the contribution of the two virtual hopping paths ( via the lead sites @xmath214 ) cancel each other , owing to the difference in the signs of coupling of site 2 to the right and left leads .",
    "thus if we start with the @xmath212 case , a non - zero off - diagonal average value @xmath169 can not be formed , and @xmath128 remains equal to zero for all values of @xmath61 [ see equation ( [ eq : mfew ] ) ] .",

    "no clear distinction has been made between the two scenarios of continuous and discontinuous population switching .",
    "we will see that the difference between these two behaviours affects the magnitude of transmission phase lapse .",
    "more generally , the behaviour of a right - left symmetric qd turns out to be qualitatively different from the one found in the larger @xmath107 regime ( coupling sign change due to `` excitonic '' correlations , section [ sec : exciton ] ) .",

    "the other , which in its pure form is operational in the left - right symmetric case , has to do with the correlation - induced `` population switching '' @xcite , which can occur either discontinuously ( in the coulomb blockade regime ) or continuously ( this leads to the coulomb blockade being lifted ) .",
    "at the most basic level , the two mechanisms share the same origin , familiar from the standard solid state physics : namely , when a band or an impurity level resides at the chemical potential and is therefore partially filled , energy may be gained by increasing the width of the band or by broadening the impurity level . in case of the `` excitonic '' mechanism , this `` broadening '' of the narrower qd level is achieved via a strong increase of hybrydisation with the broader level .",
    "this in turn is associated with the change of the coupling sign , causing the @xmath0 phase lapse to occur between the two transmission peaks . in case of the discontinuous population switching @xcite ,",
    "the levels of a partially filled dot are abruptly rearranged in such a way that the narrower level never actually crosses the chemical potential .",
    "this `` jump '' of the narrow level ( say , @xmath81 ) from @xmath273 to @xmath274 with increasing @xmath61 is accompanied by a similar jump of the transmission zero @xmath161 and therefore leads to an abrupt change of a transmission phase , @xmath341 ( renormalised phase lapse @xcite )",
    ". continuous population switching in the relevant regime ( which arises only for smaller values of @xmath207 , see sections [ sec : switching ] and [ sec : phases ] ) involves the two levels approaching the chemical potential at the same time ( along with the transmission zero ) and is accompanied by a phase lapse of @xmath0 in the absence of the two well - defined transmission peaks .",
    "the behaviour of a qd for general values of the left - right and 1 - 2 coupling asymmetries can be understood in terms of _ superposition of these two mechanisms_. the continuous population switching scenario can evolve into the `` excitonic '' one via a smooth crossover with increasing left - right asymmetry .",
    "the interplay of these two with the discontinuous population switching mechanism , on the other hand , gives rise to a number of different intermediate `` phases '' .",
    "these are characterised by different numbers ( 1 or 2 ) and mutual locations of phase jump(s ) and transmission peak(s ) .",
    "our results suggest that on the whole , the behaviour found in most cases is the one dominated by the `` excitonic '' mechanism , with a phase lapse of @xmath0 located between the two well separated coulomb blockade peaks .    from the theoretical standpoint ,",
    "our results give rise to the following two questions : ( i ) how are these findings generalised in the case of a multi - level interacting qd ?",
    "( ii ) what is the role of fluctuations , neglected in our mean - field treatment ? we will now address these issues in some detail .",
    "\\(i ) _ multi - level dots within the mean - field approach_. in general , one can expect that _ our conclusions will hold for a multilevel dot _ , with the two levels nearest the chemical potential playing the role of an `` effective '' two level qd , which at least at the mean field level would behave in a qualitative agreement with our results .",
    "one expected change is that _ the parameter area corresponding to the effective sign change ( `` excitonic '' ) mechanism will be expanded _ at the expense of the other `` phase diagram '' regions ( dominated in the mean field approach by the population switching ) . indeed , for a two - level dot the ineffectiveness of this mechanism in the absence of the right - left asymmetry ( section [ sec : exciton ] )",
    "can also be viewed as originating from the fact that each of the dot levels is coupled to a different `` subset '' of carriers in the lead ( odd and even wavefunctions ) , making the inter - level hybridisation impossible . for a multi - level dot ,",
    "the number of dot levels exceeds the number of such subsets ( which of course remains equal to two , even and odd ) .",
    "hence even if the two levels adjacent to the chemical potential have different coupling signs and only a small right - left asymmetry , each of these will hybridise with other levels further away ( some hybridised combinations may even be decoupled from the leads @xcite .",
    "this will in turn give rise to a left - right asymmetry of the `` effective '' two - level qd provided these other levels have asymmetric couplings to the two leads . on the other case",
    ", we saw ( section [ sec : exciton ] ) that even a moderate amount of initial left - right asymmetry is sufficient to activate the `` excitonic '' mechanism of the effective coupling sign change .",
    "these conclusions are in a qualitative agreement with the numerical results for multilevel dots @xcite .",
    "we note , however , that these calculations @xcite were performed using the functional renormalisation group method , and therefore include fluctuations at some level .",
    "we also note that within the mean - field approach the _ discontinuous evolution _ of the qd parameters ( driven by the discontinuous population switching mechanism ) _ will persist within the corresponding range of parameter values also in the case of a multi - level qd_. the physical reason for this is the same as in the two - level case ( section [ sec : switching ] ) : suppose that one of the qd levels is fully uncoupled from the leads ( and from the other levels ) .",
    "it is then clear that with increasing @xmath61 it will eventually be filled in a discontinuous manner ( the occupancy jumping from 0 to 1 ) , leading to a discontinuity in all the qd properties @xcite .",
    "_ within the mean - field treatment _ , such a disontinuity originates from a jump between different solutions to the mean field equations , and therefore indicates a presence of a multiple - solution area in the parameter space .",
    "this area has a finite size , and therefore removing it altogether and thus eliminating the discontinuity requires a finite ( as opposed to infinitesimal ) dot - level coupling . like in the two - level case",
    ", the discontinuous evolution will be accompanied by a renormalisation @xcite of the corresponding phase lapse values , @xmath341 ; the conductance at the corresponding values of chemical potential or gate voltage would not vanish .",
    "as described in section [ sec : phases ] , there will also arise a number of borderline `` phases '' ; in some of these , the additional positive phase jumps would appear .",
    "\\(ii ) _ role of quantum fluctuations _",
    "( validity of the mean field approach ) .",
    "the present mean field treatment does not include the effects of fluctuations .",
    "it is therefore important to understand to what extent do these alter the overall picture .",
    "while considerable effort has been made recently in this direction @xcite , certain questions still remain unanswered .",
    "below we will attempt to summarise the available results while pointing out the open problems .",
    "first , we note that the available numerical and renormalisation group studies suggest that the _ generic effects of electron - electron interaction on the dot include the appearance of the phase lapse between the two transmission peaks_. this is in qualitative agreement with the mean field results . on the other hand ,",
    "the essentially many - body features like the `` resonances '' surrounding the transmission zero @xcite , which originate from the kondo - type physics @xcite _ can not _ be reproduced at the mean field level .",
    "our mean field results suggest the _ presence of two distinct correlated mechanisms _ causing the phase lapse to occur within the inter - level energy interval .",
    "this is in line with recent renormalisation group results @xcite , suggesting that the qd behaves differently in the right - left symmetric ( `` parallel effective field '' @xcite ) and asymmetric ( `` tilted effective field '' ) cases .",
    "of the two mechanisms identified within the present mean field approach , the _",
    "`` excitonic '' _ one ( involving _ off - diagonal correlations on the dot _ , section [ sec : exciton ] ) , which requires the presence of some right - left asymmetry in the dot - lead coupling ( @xmath361 ) , is found to be more generic .",
    "indeed , it gives rise to the prevalent `` phase '' 1 in our `` phase diagram '' , figure [ fig : phadiag ] .",
    "this mechanism is not related to instabilities of any kind , and can be expected to remain robust beyond the mean field . while this is again in line with the available results , a more qualitative comparison can and should be made in order to confirm that we correctly identified the underlying physics . to this end",
    ", one should verify that the off - diagonal average , @xmath362 indeed shows a sharp peak in the regime of partial qd occupancy [ cf .",
    "figure [ fig : exciton ] _ ( b ) _ ] . while the quantity @xmath169 should be readily avaliable from numerical calculations , we are not aware of any published results for it reaches a maximum in the general area of the point where @xmath363 .",
    "this result @xcite should become exact in the large-@xmath207 , @xmath364 limit ( `` local moment regime '' @xcite ) . ] .",
    "we note that the diagonal average values , @xmath181 , have been calculated recently by the numerical renormalisation group @xcite and functional renormalisation group @xcite methods , as well as analytically @xcite . in the relevant range of values of parameters ,",
    "their dependence on the gate voltage shows strong non - monotonicity ( first noticed in the mean - field studies of the right - left symmetric case @xcite ) and looks rather similar to the mean field results as seen in figure [ fig : exciton ] _ ( b)_. another interesting question is related to the degree of 1 - 2 level coupling asymmetry required for theis mechanism to be effective .",
    "the corresponding mean - field result , equation ( [ eq : alphac ] ) , differs from the one obtained via the renormalisation group calculation in the `` local moment '' regime [ reference @xcite , equation ( 70 ) ] and a systematic numerical investigation is required in order to establish whether ( and when ) either of these is close to the actual value .",
    "the other mean field mechanism which gives rise to a phase lapse between the coulomb blockade peaks is that of _ discontinuous population switching _",
    "( section [ sec : switching ] ) .",
    "while the physical origins of the discontinuity are quite clear ( see above ) , the associated notion of multiple solution region is restricted to the mean field approach .",
    "thus , the discontinuous scenario will surely be strongly affected by the fluctuations . at present , it is not clear whether it survives in the exact treatment . neither the discontinuity , nor the associated `` renormalised '' phase lapses @xcite were found ( except at isolated points @xcite ) in either the functional renormalisation group @xcite , numerical renormalisation group @xcite , or analytical renormalisation group / bethe _ ansatz _ @xcite treatments .",
    "lastly , we wish to turn to the situation of _ perfect right - left symmetry _",
    "( @xmath212 ) and argue that it _ represents a singular case where the effects of fluctuations are most pronounced_. indeed , owing to the symmetry of this case the hybridisation , @xmath169 , and hence the effective intra - dot hopping @xmath128 remain equal to zero for all values of chemical potential or gate voltage ( section [ sec : exciton ] ) .",
    "hence the transmission zero , equation ( [ eq : intdotzero ] ) , remains outside the energy interval between the two transmission peaks at all times ( at least in the coulomb blockade regime , which is of interest to us here ) .",
    "we conclude that within the _ mean field approach _ for @xmath212 the only possibility to observe a phase lapse between the two well separated ( coulomb blockade ) transmission peaks is via a discontinuous restructuring of the spectrum , as explained in section [ sec : switching ] ( figure [ fig : switchcartoon ] ) . in this case , the phase lapse is renormalised @xcite , and is not accompanied by a transmission zero @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , the numerical results@xcite , as well as those of the renormalisation group approach @xcite , reliably indicate that at least for some values of 1 - 2 asymmetry in the right - left symmetric case , the phase lapse of exactly @xmath0 , associated with a transmission zero , does occur between the two coulomb blockade peaks .",
    "this can not be reconciled with the mean field picture _ at all _",
    ", via any sort of renormalisation of the mean field parameters ( which could be held responsible for the suppression of discontinuous behaviour at @xmath361 ) .",
    "rather , fluctuations in this case must be giving rise to a totally new physics ( albeit perhaps only in the narrow interval of values of chemical potential / gate voltage around the transmission zaro ) .",
    "we note that from the point of view of renormalisation group analysis @xcite the @xmath212 ( `` parallel effective field '' ) situation does correspond to a special case , and its relationship to behaviour at @xmath361 remains unclear .",

    "<S> lapses of transmission phase in transport through quantum dots are ubiquitous already in the absence of interaction , in which case their precise location is determined by the signs and magnitudes of the tunnelling matrix elements . </S>",

    "<S> we show that this phenomenon can be accounted for by the combined effect of asymmetric dot - lead couplings ( left lead / right lead asymmetry as well as different level broadening for different levels ) and interaction - induced `` population switching '' of the levels , rendering this behaviour generic . </S>",
