    "ever since einstein made geometric brownian motion famous @xcite , a simple liquid has been the prime example of a system in which normal diffusion occurs .",
    "gaussian statistics , which characterizes normal diffusion , is extensively utilized in various fields of research .",
    "anomalous , non - gaussian diffusion is characterized by a probability distribution function with power - law tails @xmath0 .",
    "the limiting distribution of the sum of independent variables with this property is a lvy distribution @xcite .",
    "it is well known that anomalous diffusion , in the general sense , can occur in both equilibrium and non - equilibrium contexts @xcite . amongst the fields in which examples of non - gaussian dynamics are found",
    "are economics @xcite , biology @xcite and solid state physics @xcite .",
    "the above observations have motivated extensive efforts to investigate the underlying mechanisms of non - gaussian dynamics .",
    "there are numerous methods to achieve anomalous diffusion either in lower - dimensional systems @xcite , in media @xcite , in networks @xcite or in turbulence @xcite .",
    "to our knowledge , however , in literature there is no mention of a simple computational method to achieve conditions of anomalous self - diffusion in a 3d liquid . here , we wish to propose such a method .",
    "we present a robust technique to alter the dynamics of a molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of a simple liquid in such a manner that anomalous self - diffusion emerges .",
    "these anomalous properties emerge in the average one - dimensional single time step displacement distributions @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , we propose to combine a md simulation technique with a soft - core inter - particle potential and out - of - equilibrium conditions .",
    "md is a very powerful simulation technique that is based on ( numerically ) solving the equations of motion for many interacting particles at carefully chosen regular time intervals . as a consequence ,",
    "a md simulation allows one to investigate many aspects of liquids and other systems such as self - diffusion , phase diagrams , absorption of particles and viscosity @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in classical md simulations with a lennard - jones ( lj ) inter - particle potential , the mean - square displacement ( msd ) @xmath2 has a linear time dependence and that @xmath1 is a gaussian distribution .",
    "when attempting to create conditions under which anomalous self - diffusion emerges , the hard core of the lj potential , @xmath3 , poses a real challenge . indeed , in a liquid with conditions of anomalous self - diffusion , @xmath4 obtains heavy tails and the particles can occasionally traverse a relatively large distance during a single time step . in the md simulations , those particles will momentarily travel with an exceptionally large speed .",
    "due to the finite time resolution of the simulation , they can penetrate the hard core of the lj potential and attain a velocity that is much larger than the average velocities in the simulation .",
    "this , in turn , dramatically increases the probability of particles to enter the hard core of other particles and ignites a chain reaction that makes the simulation to go out of control . in order to remedy this , we have renormalized the short - range part of the lennard - jones potential and introduced the following soft - core potential @xcite : @xmath5 \\;.   \\label{potent}\\ ] ] the parameters @xmath6 were optimized so as to match the medium- and long - range part of @xmath7 .",
    "the parameter @xmath8 determines the length scale in the system and we take @xmath9 , the diameter of argon in a lj potential .",
    "the adopted units for energy and mass are also determined for a simulation that involves argon : @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "the parameter @xmath12 determines the hardness of the core of the potential .",
    "the softer the core , the more penetrable the particles become .",
    "first , we wish to discriminate between the dynamical properties of the mono - atomic liquid for @xmath13 and @xmath14 . to this end",
    ", the potential @xmath14 of ( [ potent ] ) is used in a classical md simulation program .",
    "we investigate the self - diffusion properties , the velocity auto - correlation function ( vacf ) and the radial distribution function ( rdf ) .",
    "the vacf tracks the persistence of the motion over time and the rdf provides information about the relative particle positions , providing a means of discriminating between the liquid , gaseous or solid phase .",
    "the thermodynamic properties like temperature , potential and kinetic energy , are also monitored . in order to solve the equations of motion",
    ", we adopt the verlet algorithm , which is a symplectic integrator .     and for a lj potential .",
    "the simulation has an initial density of @xmath15 and an initial temperature of @xmath16 .",
    "the density of the system is given in particles per unit of volume and the temperature is given in system units .",
    "all distances are expressed in system units , which are determined by @xmath17 .",
    "the simulations are performed with 8788 particles , and the time step is determined by @xmath18.,width=226 ]    figure  [ fig : softparam ] shows the time dependence of the msd for various values of @xmath12 of the soft - core potential and for a lj potential . for large values of @xmath12 ,",
    "the soft - core potential of ( [ potent ] ) is qualitatively similar to @xmath13 .",
    "for all values of @xmath12 , the dynamics of the system lead to normal diffusion ( @xmath19 ) .",
    "the simulation results indicate that the diffusion coefficient @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) depends on the softness of the potential .",
    "the harder the short - range part the lower @xmath20 will be , as the collisions approach a hard - sphere interaction .",
    "the qualitative features of the vacf , rdf , energy and temperature obtained with @xmath14 resemble those of a simulation with a lj potential .",
    "there are some differences in the computed observables and the rdf , for example , reflects that the soft core allows penetration .",
    "the positional structure , typical for a liquid , is still visible in the rdf .",
    "the most important aspect , however , is the ubiquitous presence of the gaussian statistics in the self - diffusion properties .",
    "we now turn to simulations under non - equilibrium conditions . under equilibrium conditions ,",
    "the energy is conserved and the temperature fluctuates mildly around a certain value .",
    "we introduce non - equilibrium conditions by driving the system and modifying the inter - particle interaction .",
    "this can be achieved by rescaling the radial distances in the soft - core interaction @xmath22 with @xmath23 .",
    "this is equivalent to an effective increase of the size of the molecules .",
    "this allows the dynamics of the system to be changed dramatically , because particles that were attracting each other end up repelling each other due to the driven change in the inter - particle interaction range .",
    "as the imposed changes in the inter - particle interactions occur under conditions of constant density , the system develops regions of high energy density . through the dynamics of the system ,",
    "local energy surplus dissipates into sizeable kinetic energy and an increase in the temperature of the system is observed .",
    "figure  [ fig : temperature ] shows the evolution of the temperature with time for a simulation that undergoes a rescaling of the soft - core interaction of the particles .",
    "it is clear that the driven change in the radius of the molecules has a large effect on the temperature .",
    "after rescaling the radial distances , it takes of the order of a few hundred time steps for the temperature to reach a new equilibrium value",
    ".     takes place every 500 time steps .",
    "when the temperature reaches 50 , the radii and the temperature are reset to their original value ( @xmath24).,width=166 ]    to illustrate the effect of the radial rescalings on the internal dynamics of the system , the potential energy fluctuation of the system during one simulation step is shown in figure  [ fig : energyfluct ] .",
    "we consider results for @xmath25 and @xmath26 under typical equilibrium conditions and a situation just after a radial rescaling . for every particle the difference in potential energy with respect to the previous configuration",
    "is shown @xmath27    the panels of figure  [ fig : energyfluct ] represent a projection of a slice ( @xmath28 ) onto the @xmath29-plane .",
    "figure  [ fig : energ_14 ] indicates that through a sudden rescaling of the radial distances one creates regions in which the total amount of potential energy gain is much larger than the average value .",
    "figure  [ fig : energ_lj ] shows that the hard core of @xmath13 results in values of @xmath30 as high as @xmath31 , whereas this is not seen in figure  [ fig : energ_14 ] . with energy fluctuations of this size , the velocities of the particles attain values that are not compatible with a finite time - step . figure  [ fig : energ_sc_eq ] and figure  [ fig : energ_lj_eq ] show a similar type of projection for typical equilibrium conditions .",
    "the scale of @xmath30 is clearly much smaller than in the non - equilibrium situations of figures  [ fig : energ_14 ] and [ fig : energ_lj ] .",
    "the regular rescaling of the inter - particle distances drives the system s thermodynamic properties such as the temperature and the energy away from equilibrium , i.e. mild fluctuations around a constant value . as a result",
    ", the simulation resembles conditions encountered in systems which display self - organized criticality ( soc ) @xcite .",
    "these systems are characterized by a driving and a relaxation mechanism . in our studies ,",
    "the increase of the radius is the driving factor that injects potential energy at various positions in the system and the conversion from potential to kinetic energy is the relaxation mechanism .",
    "the balance between the injected and dissipated energy is linked through the local newtonian dynamics that conserves total energy .",
    "another characteristic feature of soc is that the system must be driven slowly . for our purposes",
    ", this translates into changing @xmath32 after sufficiently long time intervals . for a lj - potential , the driven changes in the distance scale of the inter - particle interaction amount to very large potential energy changes ( figure  [ fig : energ_lj ] ) that are not compatible with slowly driving the system .",
    "as repeatedly increasing the radii is not an attractive option ( because of the finite size of the simulation system ) , after some time we reset the system s original temperature and particle radius .",
    "if the temperature exceeds a certain threshold , the radii are rescaled to their original value and the velocities are rescaled so that the starting temperature is restored , see figure  [ fig : temperature ] .",
    "we identify the time intervals with a varying temperature in figure  [ fig : temperature ] as non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "now , we study the self - diffusion properties of the liquid under those non - equilibrium conditions . for a single time - step , the mean , standard deviation and kurtosis of @xmath33 and @xmath34 are calculated .",
    "the standard deviation ( @xmath35 ) and kurtosis ( @xmath36 ) are defined in the standard fashion , @xmath37 with @xmath38 the fourth moment about the mean .",
    "this definition ensures that for a gaussian distribution , the kurtosis vanishes .    to normalise the width of the different distributions , the displacements are divided by the standard deviation of the distribution at some time instance .",
    "this normalisation enables one to compare the @xmath39 that are obtained at different times .",
    "figure  [ fig : anoma ] compares @xmath40 for a typical equilibrium time instance with one obtained at a representative non - equilibrium time instance . under non - equilibrium conditions ,",
    "the tails of @xmath41 are considerably fatter than under equilibrium conditions . moreover ,",
    "a higher concentration of particles in the centre of the distribution is observed .",
    "these characteristics are typical for a leptokurtic distribution .",
    "the kurtosis of the out - of - equilibrium @xmath39 are larger than the typical noise level under equilibrium conditions .",
    "we have found that after effectively enlarging the particles , anomalous characteristics can be found in the single time step displacement distributions @xmath42 .",
    "after rescaling the interaction four times with @xmath43 and 500 time steps between the different rescalings ( sufficient to reach equilibrium again ) , we have obtained anomalous distributions in @xmath44 .    to establish the non - gaussian shape of the tail of @xmath39 under non - equilibrium conditions , we have fitted it with an exponential : @xmath45",
    "as can be seen in figure  [ fig : anomb ] and [ fig : anomd ] , the distributions are well fitted by ( [ stretched ] ) .",
    "this result confirms that the @xmath39 have fatter tails than a gaussian distribution .",
    "the distributions of figures  [ fig : anoma ] and [ fig : anomc ] are obtained by taking data during one time step . summing these distributions for different time steps results in better statistics .",
    "figure  [ fig : anom_suma ] shows the result for p(@xmath46 ) after summation of 50 distributions during anomalous and normal ( gaussian ) simulation conditions .",
    "remark that @xmath47 events are one order of magnitude more likely under anomalous ( non - equilibrium ) conditions than under gaussian ( equilibrium ) conditions .",
    "we find a fair amount of @xmath48 events and some rare @xmath49 events .",
    "the normalized cumulative distribution of figure  [ fig : anom_sum ] clearly illustrates that the self - diffusion properties of the liquid are distinctive during the non - equilibrium and equilibrium periods of the simulation . in non - equilibrium conditions ,",
    "small @xmath50 are more likely , medium @xmath50 less likely and large @xmath50 far more likely .",
    "we now wish to study the trajectories of the individual particles during the complete simulation that alternates equilibrium with non - equilibrium conditions . to this end",
    ", we selected two particles : particle @xmath51 for which @xmath52 does not exceed @xmath53 during the simulation ( since this limit is nt attainable in a gaussian simulation regime ) and particle @xmath54 for which this is not the case . figure  [ fig : anom_path ] illustrates that the random character of the trajectories for both particles is maintained over the simulation time .",

    "the anomalous character of the self - diffusion properties under non - equilibrium conditions is a very useful result .",
    "it indicates that the qualitative features of the self - diffusion properties of the system are rather insensitive to the two parameters ( @xmath32 and @xmath64 ) that characterise the non - equilibrium behaviour . as a consequence",
    ", we can ascertain that it is the internal dynamics of the system that causes the non - gaussian properties of @xmath44 .",
    "we have also tested the robustness of our results to changes in the potential . to this end",

    "in summary , we have presented a computational method , based on out - of - equilibrium md simulations with a soft - core potential , that generates dynamical conditions of anomalous diffusion for the distribution of the one - dimensional displacements of the particles .",

    "this emergence of global behaviour that can not be determined from local properties is also a property of self - organized criticality , to which our model bears similarities .",
