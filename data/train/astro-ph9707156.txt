    "our understanding of mg  ii absorbers and their relationship to normal field galaxies has grown considerably in recent years @xcite . yet there remain controversial and unanswered questions regarding detailed _ cause and effect _ relationships between gas seen in absorption and galaxies seen in emission .",
    "how do absorbing gas chemical , ionization , and kinematic conditions depend upon and influence star formation histories , merging events , and luminous morphologies of associated galaxies ?",
    "it is hoped clues to this question can be extracted from observed trends , or non  trends , of the low and high ionization gas properties with the galaxy properties and/or gas kinematics .",
    "the largest uniform survey of mg  ii systems is complete to @xmath9   @xcite .",
    "the number density of the very weakest mg  ii absorbers and their chemical and ionization conditions remain unexplored .",
    "what is their number density , what class of _ luminous _ object does @xmath10   mg  ii absorption select , and what astrophysics can we extract from these systems ?    in this contribution",
    "we report first results from ( 1 ) an hst archival study of the neutral hydrogen and high ionization absorption lines of galaxies for which the luminous properties and mg  ii gas kinematics are measured , and ( 2 ) an unbiased survey of @xmath11   systems .",
    "we have compiled a database of @xmath0 mg  ii absorption selected galaxies by combining the galaxies of steidel , dickinson , & persson @xcite , the hires mg  ii absorption profiles of churchill , vogt , & charlton @xcite and archival fos / hst spectra of neutral hydrogen and high ionization absorption lines . the fos spectra reduction and line identification methods were identical to those of the qso absorption line key project @xcite .",
    "we tested for correlations of ionization conditions and strengths of the absorbing gas with : ( 1 )  mg  ii velocity spread , @xmath13 , ( 2 )  galaxy @xmath14 and @xmath15 magnitudes and @xmath16 colors , and ( 3 )  projected galactocentric distance , @xmath17 . in table  1 , a selection of kendall @xmath18 rank correlation tests are tabulated .",
    "columns 3 , 4 , and 5 are the number of data points , the kendall @xmath18 and the significance level that the tested quantities are not uncorrelated in units of @xmath19 .",

    "the clouds of mg  ii trace the neutral hydrogen ( ly@xmath1 ) in the galaxies and have velocity spreads of @xmath44  km  s@xmath45 .",
    "the clouds may be embedded in an extended `` halo '' traced by o  vi absorption @xcite .",
    "@xmath29 does not trace @xmath24 but appears to trace @xmath32 .",
    "we infer that a significant fraction of the c  iv is spatially distributed with the putative o  vi halo .",
    "however , the @xmath29 is strongly correlated with the mg  ii velocity spread , whereas @xmath32 is not .",
    "this suggests many mg  ii clouds have ionization structures in which c  iv surrounds their lower ionization ly@xmath1mg  ii cores .",
    "there is no evidence for correlations above the 1.5@xmath19 level of absorption strengths , @xmath46 , and ionization levels , @xmath47 , with the galaxy magnitudes and colors .",
    "apparently , for @xmath12   selected systems , the stellar population is not strongly interfaced with the absorption properties .",
    "there is no compelling evidence for strong correlations of absorption properties with projected galactocentric distance , @xmath17 .",
    "perhaps the spatial distribution of mg  ii clouds is independent of galactocentric distance and there is no _ smooth _ ionization gradient surrounding these galaxies .",
    "a study that includes the galaxy morphologies , line of sight orientations , and stellar velocities may reveal a yet  unknown interrelationship between absorbing gas and galaxies .",
    "because the lines of sight studied with the hires spectra were selected based upon the presence of known @xmath12   absorbers @xcite , the number density of these systems is biased too high in our sample .",
    "however , the total redshift path is unbiased for @xmath49   systems .",
    "a systematic search for weak mg  ii doublets has been performed for a redshift path of @xmath50 over @xmath51 complete to @xmath52   ( 5@xmath19 ) @xcite .",
    "following lanzetta et  al .",
    "@xcite , the number density per unit redshift was computed .    in figure  1 , the number density of @xmath53   systems is shown .",
    "we find @xmath3 at @xmath2 .",
    "accounting for @xmath54 found for @xmath12   systems by steidel & sargent @xcite , the number density of mg  ii systems complete to @xmath55   is @xmath56 at @xmath2 . the @xmath48   systems comprise @xmath57% of all mg  ii absorbing systems at low redshift .",
    "for the sample , @xmath6 .    applying the maximum likelihood technique to the parameterized relation @xmath58",
    ", we obtained @xmath59 .",
    "this poorly constrained value is not inconsistent with a non  evolving population .",
    "a larger sample with extended redshift coverage to @xmath60 would allow the redshift evolution of these weakest systems to be tested .",
    "we suggest two types of evolution are expected over @xmath61 .",
    "first , @xmath62 likely increases with decreasing redshift as the ionizing uv background becomes less intense .",
    "second , the ratio of @xmath63 should increase with decreasing redshift for two reasons , provided the cloud densities do not strongly evolve .",
    "( 1 ) for uv background photoionization , the higher @xmath64 at higher @xmath65 produces a smaller ratio .",
    "this is consistent with the observed @xmath66 evolution @xcite .",
    "( 2 ) the chemical build up of iron  group elements ( a sn  ia process taking several gyr ) would gradually increase the fe / mg abundance ratios following the @xmath67 peak star formation epoch of the universe in which type ii sne disperse @xmath1group elements such as silicon and magnesium .",
    "if weak systems are closely associated with lsb and/or dwarf galaxies , there in fact may be a narrow redshift range at @xmath68 over which a `` break '' from uv background to local late  type stellar dominated photoionization occurs as the uv background falls below a critical level . since iron  group enrichment is gradual , such a break could be inferred from a rapid jump in the fraction of weak mg  ii systems having strong fe  ii absorption",
    ". the population of weak mg  ii systems may provide one of the most sensitive probes of the uv background evolution from @xmath7 to @xmath8 .",
