    "this leads to the wavefunction @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the dynamic phase and @xmath19 is the geometric phase .",
    "the geometric phase generator is defined as @xmath20    studies on adiabaticity and geometric phases can now be usefully extended to dissipative systems which use non - selfadjoint hamiltonians to describe resonance phenomena @xcite . when resonances are defined by some scattering boundary conditions the resonance states are unbounded .",
    "this means that numerical and theoretical treatment of the resonances is a difficult task .",
    "spectral deformation methods are commonly used to solve this problem .",
    "the first one , the complex scaling method @xcite , effectively transforms the resonance states into bound states .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes non - selfadjoint , and the resonances calculations produce non - real eigenvalues and the associated eigenvectors .",
    "the real part of a resonance eigenvalue corresponds to the resonance energy and its imaginary part corresponds to the resonance width ( the inverse of the resonance lifetime ) .",
    "a second approach is the optical potential method @xcite , which has similar properties .",
    "these two methods of resonance modelling involve non - selfadjoint hamiltonians and are used successfully to treat molecular photodissociation problems @xcite .",
    "the present paper deals with non - hermitian matrices .",
    "such matrices can be viewed as effective hamiltonians associated with the hamiltonians of resonance problems .",
    "effective hamiltonian techniques use small hamiltonians to describe complex systems without loss of informations .",
    "the principal effective hamiltonians techniques are the partitioning technique @xcite , the quantum kam method @xcite , the adiabatic elimination method @xcite and the bloch wave operator method @xcite .",
    "small non - selfadjoint matrices have also been used as hamiltonians to describe some photoionization phenomena modelled by bound states coupled with a structureless continuum ( these states are then viewed as resonances ) @xcite . finally we should note that the formalism used in this paper can be used to treat open quantum systems @xcite which are described by a lindblad equation @xmath21 where @xmath22 is a density matrix ( a traceless positive selfadjoint matrix ) and the lindbladian @xmath23 is a `` superoperator '' . for a finite dimensional hilbert space , @xmath24 , the space of the density matrices can be identified with an @xmath25-dimensional hilbert space @xmath26 ( usually called the liouville space ) . in the liouville space , the lindblad equation takes the form of the usual schrdinger equation .",

    "the non - real eigenvalues of @xmath23 ( its resonances ) are associated with the decoherence .",
    "the present work can be applied to a such system , but for the sake of simplicity we will use only the name `` hamiltonian '' even though it could represent a lindbladian in the liouville space . for non - selfadjoint hamiltonians ,",
    "the adiabatic theorem @xcite involves a criterion on the dissipation rate of the quantum system studied ( i.e. on the imaginary part of the instantaneous eigenvalue considered ) .",
    "naively , we could imagine that the adiabatic approximation for dissipative quantum systems should take the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 .",
    "the following section shows that this approximation is inconsistent , since the populations @xmath33 are not well defined .",
    "consequently a better definition of the instantaneous populations is proposed in section  [ sectiondefinition ] .",
    "this definition is equivalent to the c - product condition ( described in @xcite ) for the case of symmetric non - hermitian hamiltonians and remains valid even for the non - symmetric case .",
    "the illustrative example of a 2-state dissipative system is then described in section [ example ] , with an application to an adiabatic state flip @xcite which is generated by following a loop around an exceptional point in the parameter plane .",
    "for the sake of simplicity we consider a non - selfadjoint hamiltonian @xmath34 of rank 2 ( the discussion can easily be generalized to higher dimensions ) .",
    "we deal with a biorthogonal basis set and we use the standard scalar product . let @xmath35 be the two instantaneous eigenvalues of @xmath34 ( assumed to be diagonalizable ) and @xmath36 the two associated eigenvectors , and let @xmath37 be the biorthogonal basis , that is : @xmath38 @xmath39 ( the bar denotes the complex conjugate ) .",
    "we note that in certain highly symmetric cases ( i.e. when @xmath40 ) the @xmath41 and the @xmath42 are related by a simple complex conjugation rule ( formalized by the c - product @xcite ) .",
    "+ let @xmath43 be the matrix of the geometric phase generators and of the non - adiabatic coupling .",
    "let @xmath44 be the wave function for an evolution @xmath45 ( @xmath46 being the evolution operator ) .",
    "as in conservative systems , we could write @xmath47 @xmath48 being the `` population '' of the state 1 and @xmath49 the `` population '' of the state  2 ; the adiabatic approximation corresponds to the case where @xmath50 is negligible .",
    "however this definition presents a significant problem . by constrast with the conservative case ,",
    "where we choose an orthonormal eigenbasis to represent the dynamics , the normalization convention is arbitrary for a biorthogonal basis . indeed ,",
    "if @xmath51 constitutes a biorthogonal eigenvectors system , this is also the case for @xmath52 with @xmath53 for all arbitrary functions @xmath54 .",
    "we must then set @xmath55 with @xmath56 the population @xmath57 then depends on the arbitrary normalization convention .",
    "the calculation of the instantaneous populations then makes no sense , since the adiabatic multiplier @xmath58 can artificially grow if the normalization of @xmath59 decreases .    to solve this problem",
    ", we introduce a definition of the instantaneous populations using geometric phases .",
    "we set @xmath60 with @xmath61 .",
    "the instantaneous populations are now defined by @xmath62 .",
    "immediately we notice that for the conservative case this definition coincides with the standard definition of the instantaneous populations since @xmath63 in a self - adjoint system ( @xmath64 is purely imaginary ; the standard definition of the instantaneous populations is invariant under arbitrary changes to the phase convention of the eigenvectors ) . by making an arbitrary change in the normalization convention ,",
    "we have @xmath65 we then have @xmath66 in order to preserve the initial condition , we set @xmath67 .",
    "this leads to @xmath68 the definition of the instantaneous populations , @xmath69 , is now invariant even in the event of arbitrary changes in the normalization convention . here",
    "we insist on the fact that the coefficients @xmath70 are more intrinsic than the coefficients @xmath71 .",
    "+ owing to dissipation the total population strays away from @xmath72 ( except for @xmath73 ) .",
    "we have @xmath74 , but this is not a properly defined dissipation rate ( i.e. @xmath75 ) .",
    "the dissipation rate is given by @xmath76 with @xmath77 with @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "@xmath80 constitutes an @xmath7-dependent scalar product for @xmath81 , the representation of the wave functions in the instantaneous ( non - orthonormal ) eigenbasis .",
    "we note that @xmath80 is well defined since it is independent of the normalization convention , @xmath82 .",
    "the scalar product matrix satisfies the following differential equation : @xmath83 with @xmath84 we can then write @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the @xmath7-ordered exponential ( the dyson series ) .",
    "+ finally , if we want the instantaneous total population to be consistent with the dissipation rate , then the instantaneous population must be defined as @xmath87 with  @xmath88 .",
    "+ using this analysis , we propose that the consistent adiabatic approximation is @xmath89 and not @xmath90 . in a similar manner ,",
    "the adiabatic criterion must be independent of the arbitrary normalization convention : @xmath91    we should point out that the use of the parallel transport condition , i.e. the definition of the populations with eigenvectors @xmath92 and @xmath93 such that @xmath94 implicitely takes into account the instantaneous population definition which includes the geometric phases .",
    "indeed , it is easy to show that the @xmath92 are related to an arbitrary set of eigenvectors @xmath95 by @xmath96 in the particular case of a symmetric matrix , the left eigenvector are the complex conjugates of the right eigenvectors , so that the parallel transport condition is also equivalent to the c - product normalization condition for the eigenvectors @xmath97 , fixed by @xcite @xmath98 the result of this paper could be expressed without explicit reference to the geometric phases by saying that the treatment of the population tracking for non - hermitian systems necessary needs to impose the parallel transport condition ( whereas this is not necessary for hermitian systems ) .",
    "nevertheless , we prefer here to make the geometric phases appear explicitely .",
    "indeed the @xmath92 are defined only along the path in the parameter space defined by @xmath45 ; for a different path @xmath99 the eigenvectors @xmath100 are different .",
    "it is then more general to consider @xmath95 ( without a parallel transport condition ) which are defined globally on the whole of the parameter space .",
    "+ moreover we note that we can not use the parallel transport condition to define the eigenvectors if the path is closed @xmath101 , because of the double definition of the eigenvectors at @xmath102 : @xmath103 the impossibility of giving a single definition of the eigenvectors in the parallel transport condition @xmath104 is called the holonomy of the parallel transport .",
    "+ the next section illustrates that numerical artifacts due to bad definitions of the populations can induce a false adiabaticity or a false inversion of population in numerical simulations .",
    "the definition ( [ gooddefinition ] ) is relevant for non - hermitian symmetric or non - symmetric matrices . while the formalism used here should work for larger more realistic hamiltonians and for floquet - type hamiltonians , we study here a low dimensional illustrative example for which the data can be shown conveniently .",
    "let the parameter dependent hamiltonian be @xmath105 @xmath106 .",
    "this hamiltonian is associated with a quantum bound state coupled to a quantum resonance ( with resonance width @xmath107 ) by a laser field with amplitude @xmath108 and phase @xmath109 .",
    "the laser field is quasiresonant with the transition from the bound state to the resonance with a detuning value equal to @xmath110 .",
    "we assume that we can modulate the complex numbers @xmath111 to generate a dynamics .",
    "+      the spectrum of @xmath6 is @xmath112 where @xmath113 ( we choose the riemann sheet such that @xmath114 ) .",
    "we restrict our attention to the parameters @xmath111 such that @xmath115 ( @xmath116 is the less dissipative ) .",
    "+ we can easily verify that the eigenvectors of @xmath117 are @xmath118 are the appropriate factors to fix the initial norm of the basis vectors to @xmath72 , i.e. @xmath119 the biorthogonal basis set is @xmath120 we can verify that another possible eigenstate 1 reads @xmath121 with @xmath122 and @xmath123 the factor @xmath124 ensures that @xmath125 in order to preserve the initial condition .",
    "we assume that @xmath126 .",
    "the associated biorthogonal eigenvector is @xmath127 the normalization factor between the two conventions approaches zero at the limit @xmath128 , @xmath129 with this normalization , the first geometric phase generator becomes @xmath130    these properties induce the following analysis .",
    "let @xmath131 be the solution to the schrdinger equation for the evolution @xmath132 with the initial state @xmath133 .",

    "this is consistent with our analysis because this false inversion of populations occurs when @xmath162 becomes very small due to the gaussian function .",

    "if the dynamics is adiabatic , starting with one of the eigenstates @xmath185 leads to a final state @xmath186 which is proportional to @xmath187 .",

    "this interesting form of degeneracy in non - hermitian quantum problems is the subject of several recent papers , involving both theoretical @xcite and experimental @xcite studies .",
    "the references @xcite deal with a symmetric matrix and show that beginning the loop with one state is favourable to an adiabatic behaviour which leads to an adiabatic flip ( interchange ) , while beginning with the other one ( the more dissipative one ) induces strong non - adiabatic couplings and state exchange during the process , whatever the time duration .",
    "the occupancy coefficients of the two states and the states themselves are exchanged during the loop , leading finally to an absence of flip .",
    "this is consistent with the conditions associated with the applicability of the adiabatic theorem @xcite .",

    "when one works with dissipative quantum systems , the erratic time evolution of the norm of the adiabatic eigenvectors can create difficulties in answering the question : what is the relevant definition of a population ? when the eigenvectors are calculated numerically ( for large matrices ) , there is no reason for them to be continuously transformed from one point to another in time , thus the norm variations can appear to be quite disordered ( worse than in our semi - analytic example ) .",
    "seemingly , the easiest intuitive solution is to artificialy normalize the `` right '' eigenvectors as if we were working with an orthogonal basis set , but this is not a coherent way to work .",
    "we have shown that it is much preferable to compensate for the erratic variations in the norm of the adiabatic basis set by including the exponentials of the geometric phases in the basis vector decomposition , leading to an invariant definition of the populations under arbitrary changes of the normalization choice .",
