    "<S> the opacity of the earth to incident ultra high energy neutrinos is directly connected with the behaviour of the neutrino - nucleon ( @xmath0 ) cross sections in a kinematic range utterly unexplored . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the uncertainties in @xmath0 due the different qcd dynamic models modify the neutrino absorption while they travel across the earth . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we compare the predictions of two extreme scenarios for the high energy behaviour of the cross section , which are consistent with the current experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> the first scenario considered is based on the solution of the linear dglap equations at small-@xmath1 and large-@xmath2 , while the second one take into account the unitarity effects in the neutrino - nucleon cross section by the imposition of the froissart bound behaviour in the nucleon structure functions at large energies . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that probability of absorption and the angular distribution of neutrino events are sensitive to the the qcd dynamics at ultra high energies .    the observation of ultra high energy ( uhe ) neutrino events at pev by the icecube collaboration marks the birth of neutrino astronomy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> astrophysical neutrinos are good messengers from sky . </S>",
    "<S> they have small cross - sections even at ultra high energies and hence they are weakly absorbed by the medium that they travel . </S>",
    "<S> this property allows neutrinos to travel large distances trough the universe basically unperturbed , bringing to us information about the nature of the medium in which they are produced . </S>",
    "<S> also neutrinos are not deflected by any magnetic field , and hence , when uhe neutrinos are detected in the earth , the muon tracks produced into detector points to their source . in this way , these astrophysical neutrinos would help to solve the puzzles of what are the source of uhe particles as well as the production mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the combination of uhe neutrinos and cosmic rays in the so called multi - channel astroparticle analysis should allow to determinate the origin of such high energy particles .    in order to interpret the experimental results </S>",
    "<S> is fundamental to take into account that the attenuation of the neutrino beam in route to a detector is strongly dependent on the high energy behaviour of the neutrino - nucleon cross section ( @xmath0 ) , which determines the opacity of the earth to incident neutrinos ( for a review see , e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> as discussed by several authors in the last years @xcite , at ultra high energies , the neutrino - nucleon cross section provides a probe of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) in the kinematic region of very small values of bjorken-@xmath1 and large virtualities @xmath2 , which was not explored by the hera measurements of the structure functions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these studies demonstrated that the uncertainties present in the extrapolations of @xmath0 for this new kinematic range has direct impact in the event rate in high energy neutrino telescopes @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the results from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite shown that the solution of the linear dokshitzer - gribov - lipatov - altarelli - parisi ( dglap ) equation @xcite at small - @xmath1 and large @xmath2 obtained in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , denoted fjkpp hereafter , provides an upper bound for the behaviour of @xmath0 at ultra high energies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the solution proposed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , denoted bbmt hereafter , which imposes that @xmath0 satisfies the froissart bound at high energies , can be considered a lower bound . as demonstrated in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , models that taken into account the non - linear effects to the qcd dynamics predict high energy behaviours between these extreme scenarios .    </S>",
    "<S> our goal in this paper is to extend these previous studies for the analysis of the probability of neutrino absorption by the earth s interior at ultra high energies and determine the theoretical uncertainty present in this quantity . in particular , we compare our predictions with those obtained using the standard approach proposed in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , denoted gqrs hereafter . for completeness </S>",
    "<S> , we also present the results for the absorption due to the glashow resonance in the anti neutrino - electron scattering @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis is motivated by the fact that the icecube @xcite and antares @xcite observatories are sensitive to neutrinos below the horizon line . </S>",
    "<S> however , depending of the magnitude of the charged current neutrino interactions and the glashow resonance , the earth s can become fully opaque to neutrinos with very high energies , which implies that e.g. the icecube can becomes blind to neutrinos coming from north hemisphere @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , as neutrinos coming from different directions travels different distances and feels distinct matter potential , the contribution of these interactions modify the attenuation effect , which should lead to distortion in the angular distributions of events . </S>",
    "<S> both aspects motivate a detailed analysis of the neutrino absorption by the earth .    </S>",
    "<S> lets start our analysis presenting a brief review of the main formulas used to estimate the probability of neutrino absorption by the earth s interior . </S>",
    "<S> following @xcite we define the probability of neutrino interaction while cross the earth as @xmath3 where @xmath4 and the interaction length for scattering with nucleons and electrons is given respectively by @xmath5 the amount of matter that neutrinos feels while travel across the earth is a function of the zenith angle @xmath6 @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the total distance travelled by neutrinos , @xmath9 $ ] is the density profile of the earth . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we use the density profile from @xcite and , following @xcite , we define @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the factor @xmath11 is the average ratio between electrons ( @xmath12 ) and nucleons ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have that @xmath14 for @xmath15 km and @xmath16 for @xmath17 km [ see fig . 10.26 from ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite for details ] . in this way we can write @xmath18 \\,\\ , , \\nonumber \\\\ </S>",
    "<S> \\rho_{e}(r ) & = & \\frac{n_{e}}{n_{a}}\\,[g / cm^{3 } ] \\,\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 cmwe ( centimeters of water equivalent ) is the avogadro s number . for @xmath20 neutrinos crosses all the earth , and eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ zfun ] ) results in 10kt/@xmath21 , or @xmath22 cmwe . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , we can write    @xmath23    where @xmath24 and @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we can define the absorption function for the neutrinos while it crosses the earth as    @xmath26    in what follows we will estimate @xmath27 and @xmath28 considering different models for the ( anti ) neutrino - nucleon cross section and , for comparison , we also present the results for ( anti ) neutrino - lepton interactions . </S>",
    "<S> deep inelastic neutrino - nucleon scattering is described in terms of charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) interactions , which proceed through @xmath29 and @xmath30 exchanges , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as the neutral current ( nc ) interactions are sub - dominant , we will consider in what follows , for simplicity , only charged current ( cc ) interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the total neutrino - nucleon cross section is given by @xcite @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the neutrino energy , @xmath33 with @xmath34 the hadron mass , @xmath35 and @xmath36 is the minimum value of @xmath2 which is introduced in order to stay in the deep inelastic region . in what follows </S>",
    "<S> we assume @xmath37 gev@xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the differential cross section is expressed in terms of the nucleon structure functions @xmath39 as follows @xcite    @xmath40\\,\\ , , \\label{difcross}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath41 is the fermi constant and @xmath42 denotes the mass of the charged gauge boson . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation of @xmath43 involves integrations over @xmath1 and @xmath2 , with the integral being dominated by the interaction with partons of lower @xmath1 and @xmath2 values of the order of the electroweak boson mass squared . in the qcd improved parton model the structure functions @xmath44 and @xmath45 are calculated in terms of quark and gluon distribution functions . in this case </S>",
    "<S> the neutrino - nucleon cross section for charged current interactions on an isoscalar target is given by ( see , e.g. ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) :    @xmath46 \\label{difcross_partonic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with the quark and anti - quark densities given by @xmath47 and @xmath48 .        </S>",
    "<S> the current estimates of the neutrino nucleon cross sections constrain the structure functions and/or parton distributions using the hera data and are based on linear qcd dynamics ( dglap or an unified dglap / bfkl evolution ) @xcite or by models that taken into account the non - linear effects of qcd dynamics that area expected to be present at high energies @xcite . in particular , the neutrino - nucleon cross section was originally calculated at leading order in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , with the resulting parametrization being a benchmark for the evaluation of uhe cosmic neutrinos . in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite a next - to - leading order analysis was performed , and the uncertainties on high energy @xmath49 which are compatible with the conventional dglap formalism @xcite were estimated . moreover , in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was estimated considering an analytical solution of the dglap equation , valid at twist-2 and small-@xmath1 , which implies a power - like increasing of the cross section at ultra high energies . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in ref . @xcite the hera data were successfully fitted assuming that the proton structure function saturates the froissart bound , which implies @xmath50 and , consequently , that the increasing of @xmath51 is smaller in comparison to the dglap predictions . in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ nucle - ress ] we present a comparison between the predictions of the linear approaches ( gqrs and fjkpp ) and the froissart - inspired model ( bbmt ) for the energy dependence of the neutrino nucleon cc cross section . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for completeness of our analysis , we also present the predictions obtained the ct10 parametrization @xcite for the parton distributions ( pdfs ) , derived using the dglap evolution equations , which allows to estimate the uncertainty present in the global fits as well as those associated to the extrapolation of the pdfs in a kinematical range beyond that probed by hera , represented by the shaded band in the fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ nucle - ress ] . </S>",
    "<S> as expected from the solution of the dglap equation at small-@xmath1 , the gqrs , fjkpp and ct10 models predict a strong increase of the cross section at ultra high energies , with the ct10 predictions being consistent with the gqrs and fjkpp results . </S>",
    "<S> morever , the uncertainties present in the ct10 pdfs are fully propagated to the neutrino - nucleon cross section , with the size of the shaded band increasing at larger energies . </S>",
    "<S> although these approaches agree at low energies , where the behaviour of the parton distributions are constrained by the hera data , the gqrs and fjkpp differ by a factor 1.25 at @xmath52 gev and they are a factor 2 larger than the bbmt prediction . moreover , at larger @xmath32 , the fjkpp model predicts a strong increasing with the energy , differing from the bbmt prediction by a factor @xmath53 for @xmath54 gev . in comparison to the lower ct10 prediction , the bbmt one is smaller by a factor @xmath55 for this neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have verified that the theoretical uncertainty increases for a factor @xmath56 ( 4.5 ) when we compare the fjkpp ( ct10 ) and bbmt predictions for @xmath57 gev . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that in refs . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite the authors have analysed the robustness of its results at large energies and estimated the uncertainties for the bbmt and fjkpp predictions at @xmath54 gev as being smaller than 6% and 14 % , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we have that the resulting variations in the bbmt predictions are negligible comparable to the very large differences with respect to the fjkpp or ct10 predictions .    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ nucle - ress ] we also present for comparison the predictions for the anti neutrino - electron cross section , taking into account the presence of the glashow resonance which is expected for neutrinos energies of the order of @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> our predictions were obtained using the expressions for the cross sections presented in refs . @xcite and the more recent values for the weinberg angle , boson gauge masses and decay rates as given in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our results demonstrate that anti neutrino - electron scattering becomes equal or greater than cc neutrino - nucleon cross - section in the energy range characterized by @xmath59 gev @xmath60 gev .     +   +     in fig . [ pshad1 ] </S>",
    "<S> present our results for the energy dependence of the probability of neutrino absorption considering different values of the zenith angle @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we have found that the peak of resonant @xmath61 cross section is translated into a maximum of absorption for @xmath62 gev , for all values of @xmath63 . basically , </S>",
    "<S> the angular effect in the resonant absorption is to enlarge the width of the resonance for @xmath64 , when neutrinos travels greater distances inside earth and experiment higher values of electron density . as expected , increasing the angle of the neutrino incidence , the higher density crossed by neutrinos amplify the effects of absorption due to cc neutrino - nucleon scattering , in such way that it dislocates the curves of @xmath65 absorption to lower values of neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> we have that the earth becomes fully opaque to neutrinos for @xmath66 is @xmath67 gev , while for @xmath68 it is @xmath69 gev . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , the relative importance of neutrino - nucleon absorption to the glashow resonance depends of the angle of incidence of the neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicate that for @xmath70 , the attenuation due cc neutrino interactions becomes more important than the glashow resonance even at icecube energy range . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the comparison between the distinct @xmath65 predictions demonstrate that they can differ by @xmath71 ( @xmath72 ) at @xmath73 ( @xmath74 ) tev , with the earth not being fully opaque to neutrinos in this energy range even at @xmath75 , as indicated in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ pshad1 ] ( c ) . on the other hand , for @xmath76 and ultra high energies , </S>",
    "<S> the distinct cc @xmath65 predictions can be differ by @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> basically , we obtain that the difference between these predictions is dependent on the zenith angle and the neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> such uncertainty is not negligible and should be considered in the determination of the angular distribution of events in the icecube and/or future observatories .    . </S>",
    "<S> ]    in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:10 ] we present our predictions for the absorption function @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> we have that the integration over the zenith angle tends to reduce the energy range impacted by the glashow resonance absorption . moreover , we have that the distinct predictions for @xmath65 interactions are very similar for @xmath78 gev , with the difference between the predictions reaching @xmath79 at @xmath80 tev . on the other hand , at larger energies we have that the difference between the fjkpp ( ct10 ) and bbmt predictions increases and becomes a factor 2 at @xmath81 gev , with the bbmt one being an upper bound . </S>",
    "<S> it is important to emphasize that considering the current estimates for the neutrino spectrum , which predict that the neutrino flux decreases with the energy with a power like behaviour , we have that the number of expected events at icecube and/or future observatories should be small for these energies . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the difference of a factor two between the predictions has a strong impact in the analysis and interpretation of the possible few events that should be observed .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , lets summarize our main conclusions . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we have estimated the impact of the current uncertainty in the description of @xmath65 interactions at ultra high energies in the absorption of neutrinos crossing the earth until the detectors . moreover , for comparison , the predictions considering @xmath61 were also presented . </S>",
    "<S> our results indicated that the angular distribution of the neutrino events and the probability of absorption are sensitive to the treatment of the qcd dynamics at ultra high energies . </S>",
    "<S> such results have direct implication in the determination of sources of uhe neutrinos below the horizon of icecube neutrino observatory and in the analysis of the neutrino events in future observatories . </S>"
