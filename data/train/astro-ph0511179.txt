    "new observations of thermal radiation from isolated middle - aged neutron stars ( e.g. , pavlov , zavlin & sanwal 2002 , pavlov & zavlin  2003 ) initiated further development of the cooling theory of these objects .",
    "its main aim is to interpret the data and constrain still poorly known properties of dense matter in neutron star cores , such as the composition , the equation of state and nucleon superfluidity ( e.g. , yakovlev & pethick 2004 , page et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) .",
    "it is well - known ( e.g. , yakovlev & pethick 2004 ) that theoretical models of non - superfluid neutron stars which possess nucleon cores and cool via the modified urca process of neutrino emission can not explain the observations .",
    "some neutron stars ( e.g. , rx j08224300 and psr b105552 ) are much warmer than predicted by these theories , while others ( e.g. , the vela pulsar or the compact source in cta 1 ) are much colder .",
    "warmest objects can be treated as relatively low - mass neutron stars with strong proton ( e.g. , kaminker , haensel & yakovlev 2001 ) or neutron ( e.g. , gusakov et al .",
    "2004b ) pairing in their cores .",
    "strong pairing suppresses the modified urca process and makes the stars warmer .",
    "coldest stars should have higher neutrino emission than the emission provided by the modified urca process .",
    "they are usually treated as massive neutron stars which cool either via the powerful direct urca process in nucleon ( or nucleon / hyperon ) matter or via similar processes in kaon - condensed , pion - condensed , or quark matter in their inner cores .",
    "recently page et al .  ( 2004 ) and gusakov et al .  ( 2004a ) proposed new scenarios of neutron star cooling which involve only standard physics of neutron star interiors .",
    "the neutron star cores are assumed to contain nucleons ( no exotic forms of matter ) with the forbidden direct urca process .",
    "some enhancement of the cooling can be provided by neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of nucleons .",
    "page et al .  ( 2004 ) called their cooling scenario the `` minimal cooling model '' ( for its simplicity ) .",
    "we will also use this very properly chosen name for the scenario of gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004a ) that is based on the same assumptions ( but differs in their realization ; see below ) .    according to our previous paper ( gusakov et al .",
    "2004a ) the enhanced cooling is produced by the neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of neutrons in the cores of massive neutron stars , while warmest objects are thought to be low - mass stars with strong proton pairing in their cores .",
    "we assumed a phenomenological model of strong density - dependent singlet - state proton pairing with the critical temperature @xmath3 that has the maximum value @xmath4  k. we also assumed a phenomenological model of moderate triplet - state neutron pairing @xmath5 with the maximum critical temperature @xmath6  k shifted to higher @xmath7 , where proton pairing dies out .",
    "we were able to interpret all the data but under stringent constraints on the density dependence of @xmath5 .",
    "the present paper extends our previous analysis .",
    "we use the same equation of state of matter in neutron star interiors ( douchin & haensel  2001 ) and the same model of triplet - state neutron pairing",
    ". however , in addition , we take into account the effects of surface layers of light ( accreted ) elements ( h and/or he ) , as well as singlet - state neutron pairing @xmath2 in the stellar crust .",
    "the effects of accreted envelopes allow us to lower proton pairing ( @xmath8  k ) required to explain the data .",
    "this weaker proton pairing is consistent with recent microscopic calculations of proton critical temperatures by zuo et al .",

    "2004 ) , it may be instructive to compare the cooling theory with measured values of stellar thermal surface luminosities @xmath11 , rather than with @xmath10 .",

    "also , let us note that the radii of our neutron star models used for the cooling calculations presented below are consistent with the radii used for the interpretation of the data .",

    "( 2004a ) we adopt the moderately stiff equation of state for the neutron star matter suggested by douchin & haensel ( 2001 ) . in this case a neutron star core ( a region of density @xmath48 g  @xmath49 ) consists of neutrons with the admixture of protons , electrons and muons .",
    "all constituents exist everywhere in the core , except for muons which appear at @xmath50  g  @xmath49 .",
    "the most massive stable star has the ( gravitational ) mass @xmath51 , the central density @xmath52  g  @xmath49 , and the ( circumferential ) radius @xmath53  km .",
    "the parameters of neutron stars with some other masses are given by gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "the employed equation of state forbids the powerful direct urca process of neutrino emission ( lattimer et al .",
    "1991 ) in all stable neutron stars ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "accordingly , a non - superfluid neutron star of any mass in the range @xmath55 ( without any accreted envelope ) will have almost the same ( universal ) cooling curve @xmath56 ( the dotted curve in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) . at the neutrino cooling stage , this curve is determined by the modified urca process and is almost independent of the equation of state in the stellar core ( see , e.g. , yakovlev & pethick 2004 and references therein ) . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , this universal cooling curve can not explain the data .",
    "we will show that all the data can be explained assuming nucleon superfluidity in the internal layers of neutron stars and the presence of accreted envelopes ( of light elements ) .    following the standard procedure ( gudmundsson , pethick & epstein 1983 ) our code calculates heat transport in the neutron - star interior ( @xmath57 g  @xmath49 ) and uses the predetermined relation between the effective surface temperature @xmath43 and the temperature @xmath58 at the bottom of the surface heat - blanketing envelope ( @xmath59 ) .",
    "we use the relation calculated by potekhin , chabrier , & yakovlev ( 1997 ) and updated by potekhin et al .",
    "we will employ the models of blanketing envelopes made of iron ( which is the standard assumption ) and envelopes containing light elements .",
    "the detailed description of these models is given by potekhin et al .",
    "( 2003 ) . the thermal energy in the heat - blanketing envelope is mainly conducted by electrons .",
    "the thermal conductivity of electrons which scatter off lighter ions in the accreted envelope is higher than the conductivity in the iron envelope .",
    "this means that the accreted envelope is more heat transparent than the iron one , resulting in higher @xmath43 for the same @xmath58 .",
    "this rise of the surface temperature depends on @xmath58 and @xmath60 , the mass of light elements ( hydrogen and/or helium , with a possible carbon / oxygen layer at the bottom of the accreted envelope as a result of nuclear burning of lighter elements ) .",
    "potekhin et al .",
    "( 1997 , 2003 ) varied the boundaries of layers containing different elements within physically reasonable limits and found that the resulting relation between @xmath43 and @xmath58 is remarkably insensitive to these variations and depends mainly on @xmath60 .",
    "however , @xmath60 can not exceed @xmath61 , because at higher @xmath60 the bottom density of the accreted envelope would exceed @xmath62 g  @xmath49 . at such high densities , light elements ( including carbon / oxygen )",
    "would rapidly transform into heavier ones .    at the neutrino cooling stage @xmath58",
    "is governed by the neutrino emission from the stellar interior and is almost independent of conductive properties in the heat - blanketing envelope .",
    "in contrast , at the photon cooling stage the star with the accreted envelope has lower @xmath58 and , consequently , lower @xmath43 due to higher heat transparency of the surface layers .",
    "this leads to faster photon cooling through the surface ( for not too cold stars ; see , e.g. , potekhin et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "the cooling of a neutron star is sensitive to superfluidity of nucleons in the stellar core and to superfluidity of free neutrons in the inner stellar crust .",
    "any superfluidity is characterized by its own density - dependent critical temperature @xmath63 .",
    "microscopic theories predict mainly ( i ) singlet - state ( @xmath64s@xmath65 ) pairing of neutrons ( @xmath66 ) in the inner crust and the outermost core ; ( ii ) @xmath64s@xmath65 proton pairing in the core ( @xmath67 ) ; and ( iii ) triplet - state ( @xmath68p@xmath69 ) neutron pairing in the core ( @xmath70 ) .",
    "these theories give a large scatter of critical temperatures , from @xmath71  k to @xmath72  k and lower , depending on a nucleon - nucleon interaction model and a many - body theory employed ( e.g. , lombardo & schulze  2001 , yakovlev et al .",
    "1999 ; also see recent papers by schwenk & friman  2004 , takatsuka & tamagaki  2004 , zuo et al .",
    "2004 , tanigawa et al .",
    "because of these huge theoretical uncertainties , we will not rely on any specific microscopic results but will treat @xmath0 and @xmath73 as phenomenological functions of @xmath7 ( which can be varied in physically reasonable limits ) .",
    "our aim will be to constrain these functions by comparing theoretical cooling curves with the observations .",
    "superfluidity of nucleons affects the heat capacity and suppresses neutrino processes such as urca and nucleon - nucleon bremsstrahlung processes ( as reviewed , e.g. , by yakovlev et al .",
    "it also introduces an additional neutrino emission mechanism associated with cooper pairing of nucleons ( flowers , ruderman & sutherland 1976 ) .",
    "all these effects of superfluidity are incorporated into our cooling code . while calculating the neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of protons we use phenomenological values of weak - interaction parameters renormalized by many - body effects ( the same as in gusakov et al .",
    "2004b ) .    in the left panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] we plot models for nucleon pairing adopted in our calculations : one model ns1 of strong singlet - state pairing of neutrons ( with the peak of @xmath2 approximately equal to @xmath74  k ) ; three models of proton pairing",
    "strong p1 , moderately strong p2 , and moderate p3 ( @xmath75  k , @xmath76  k , and @xmath77  k , respectively ) ; and one model nt1 of moderate triplet - state neutron pairing ( @xmath78  k ) . models p1 and nt1 are the same as in gusakov et al .  (",
    "now we add models of weaker proton pairing ( particularly , p2 ) .",
    "strong proton pairing has been predicted in a number of publications ( e.g. , tanigawa et al .",
    "2004 ) while other publications predict much weaker proton pairing ( e.g. , zuo et al .",
    "2004 , takatsuka & tamagaki 2004 ) .    as seen from the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , proton pairing p2 combined with strong crustal superfluidity of neutrons ns1 results in too cold low - mass neutron stars .",
    "the neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of protons in the core and of neutrons in the inner crust ( see section [ low - mass ] ) accelerates the cooling and does not allow us to explain the observations of the young and hot neutron stars , rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 .",
    "however , this cooling scenario is consistent with the observations of the old and warm neutron stars , psr 105552 and rx j0720.43125 .",
    "accreted envelopes can rise the surface temperatures of middle - aged neutron stars and explain the observations of rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 .",
    "this is demonstrated by the dot - and - dashed cooling curve for the low - mass star with the accreted envelope of the mass @xmath79 .",
    "our interpretation of the neutron stars coldest for their age ( psr j0205 + 6449 in 3c 58 , rx j0007.0 + 7303 in cta  1 , the vela and geminga pulsars ) remains the same as in gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004a ) .",
    "these objects can be treated as massive neutron stars ( @xmath80 ) with moderate triplet - state neutron pairing nt1 in their inner cores where proton pairing p1 ( as well as p2 and p3 ) dies out ( the left panel of fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "our phenomenological pairing model nt1 seems specific ( shifted to too high densities @xmath7 ) .",
    "however similar models have been obtained from microscopic theories ( e.g. , see the curve @xmath81 in fig .  1 of takatsuka & tamagaki 1997 ) .",
    "in this way we come to the same three distinct classes of cooling neutron stars as in gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004a ) ( and generally as in kaminker et al .",
    "the first class contains low - mass stars whose surface layers are composed either of iron or of light elements ( solid or dot - and - dashed cooling curves , respectively , for the @xmath82 star in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "another class contains high - mass stars which show _ enhanced _ cooling ( the solid curve for the @xmath83 star ) produced by the neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of neutrons .",
    "finally , there is a class of medium - mass neutron stars ( the solid curve for the @xmath84 star ) which show intermediate cooling .",
    "their cooling curves fill in the space between the upper curve for low - mass stars and the lower curve for high - mass stars .",
    "these curves explain the observations of psr b170644 , psr j0538 + 2817 , and rx j1856.43754 .",
    "as has been shown in section [ physics ] , the presence of light elements on the surfaces of the younger and hotter neutron stars , rx  j0822 - 4300 and 1e  1207.4 - 5209 , can allow us to explain their observations if we assume moderately strong proton pairing p2 in their interiors .",
    "this pairing is also consistent with the observations of the old and warmest sources , psr b105552 and rx j0720.43125 .",
    "we interpret all these sources as low - mass neutron stars .",
    "let us analyze the main cooling regulators of such stars .    in our case ,",
    "triplet - state neutron pairing in low - mass stars is weak .",
    "for the adopted equation of state of douchin & haensel ( 2001 ) , this implies @xmath85 k at @xmath86 g  @xmath49 . under this condition , neutron pairing does not affect the cooling of low - mass stars ( @xmath87 ) at least at the neutrino cooling stage . the thin short - dash line in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows that ( in the absence of crustal pairing ) strong proton pairing p1 is needed to explain the data on all neutron stars hottest for their age ( gusakov et al .",
    "in contrast , cooling curves for moderately strong proton pairing p2 ( the thin solid line ) and moderate pairing p3 ( the thin long - dashed line ) go essentially lower than the curve for pairing p1 , being inconsistent with the observations of rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 .",
    "more rapid cooling for these two models of proton superfluidity is provided by the neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of protons which occurs at @xmath88@xmath89  yr .",
    "thick lines in the left panel of fig .  [ fig2 ]",
    "demonstrate the additional effect of neutron pairing ns1 in the crust .",
    "comparing three thick lines , one can see that crustal neutron pairing noticeably accelerates only very slow cooling of low - mass neutron stars with strong proton pairing p1 in their cores ( yakovlev et al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) . in that case",
    "the neutrino luminosity due to cooper pairing of neutrons in the stellar crust at @xmath90  yr may dominate the total neutrino luminosity of the stellar core .",
    "moreover , at @xmath91  yr crustal neutron pairing reduces the heat capacity of the crust .",
    "both effects accelerate the cooling and decrease @xmath10 , violating the interpretation of the two hottest sources , rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 .",
    "any model of weaker crustal superfluidity will only bring cooling curves closer to thin ones and simplify the interpretation of the observations .",
    "on the other hand , for moderately strong ( p2 ) or moderate ( p3 ) proton pairing in the core , the effects of strong crustal neutron pairing on the cooling of middle - aged neutron stars ( @xmath92  yr @xmath93  yr ) are almost negligible .",
    "the neutrino emission due to crustal cooper pairing of neutrons can noticeably accelerate the cooling and decrease @xmath10 only during the internal thermal relaxation stage ( @xmath44  yr ) .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] demonstrates that the observations of rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 can be explained by adopting any model of proton pairing ( p1 , p2 or p3 ) , model ns1 of crustal superfluidity , and the presence of an accreted envelope of the mass @xmath94 ( thin lines ) .",
    "let us note , that the upper dot - and - short - dashed cooling curve goes higher than is needed to interpret the observations of the young and hottest source rx j08224300 .",
    "accordingly , following yakovlev et al .",
    "( 2002 ) ( also see potekhin et al .  2003 ) , we may assume the presence of a thinner accreted envelope ( e.g. , @xmath95 ) to interpret the observations of rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 ( for the combination of p1 and ns1 pairing ) .",
    "the stronger proton core superfluidity , the less massive accreted envelope is needed for the interpretation of the data for these two stars .    in order to explain the old and warmest sources , psr b105552 and rx j0720.43125 , we will treat them as low - mass stars with the iron surface and proton pairing p2 in the core ( or similar model of pairing with the peak of critical temperature @xmath8  k ) .",
    "moreover , the presence of any crustal neutron pairing ( for example , ns1 ; thick solid lines in fig .  [ fig2 ] ) , does not violate the interpretation of these sources . note that proton pairing p3 ( thick long - dashed lines ) is less appropriate for the interpretation of these sources than pairing p2 .",

    "figure [ fig3 ] shows a strong rise of cooling curves for neutron stars with accreted envelopes at the neutrino cooling stage ( @xmath97  yr ) and their steep decrease at the photon cooling stage . their photon stage starts earlier than for stars with the iron surface . assuming the presence of accreted envelopes",
    ", we can explain the observations of the young and hottest neutron stars , rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 , treating them either as low - mass or as medium - mass stars .",
    "in contrast , the observations of the old and warmest objects , psr b105552 and rx j0720.43125 , can be explained only by treating them as low - mass stars with the iron surfaces and with moderately strong ( or strong ) proton pairing inside .",
    "it was shown by chang & bildsten  ( 2003 , 2004 ) that the mass of light elements may decrease with time , particularly due to diffusive nuclear burning .",
    "the characteristic burning time @xmath98 can be considered as an additional cooling regulator .",
    "following chang & bildsten  ( 2003 , 2004 ) and page et al .",
    "( 2004 ) we assume that the mass of light elements decreases with time as @xmath99 , where @xmath100 is the initial mass .    =    figure [ fig4 ] illustrates the effect of variable mass of the accretion envelope on the cooling of the @xmath101 neutron star .",
    "all cooling curves are calculated assuming nucleon pairing p2 , nt1 , and ns1 .",
    "the thick solid line is our typical cooling curve for a low - mass superfluid star without any accreted envelope .",
    "we use two values of the initial mass of light elements @xmath102 and @xmath103 and present thus three pairs of cooling curves for three characteristic times @xmath98 .",
    "when @xmath98 is lower than the time of the transition from the neutrino cooling stage to the photon stage ( @xmath104  yr ) we obtain a smooth transition of the cooling track from the regime of highest temperatures in young stars to the regime of lower temperatures in old stars ( cf .  the curves for @xmath82 in figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "this effect has been pointed out by page et al .",

    "yr cooling curves merge into the _ limiting _ curve obtained for constant @xmath106 . in the intermediate case of @xmath107",
    "yr @xmath108  yr the cooling curves gradually approach this limiting curve with the increase of @xmath98 . as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , by assuming any @xmath98 in the range @xmath92  yr @xmath109  yr one can explain the observations of all neutron stars hottest for their age by one cooling curve .",
    "note also that the value @xmath102 is too small to explain the observations of young and hottest neutron stars , especially rx j08224300 , at any @xmath98 .",
    "as remarked by chang & bildsten ( 2004 ) , an accreted envelope of a pulsar can become thinner owing to the excavation of ions from the stellar surface by a pulsar wind at a rate @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the pulsar spin frequency , @xmath112 is the magnetic moment , and @xmath113 is the ion mass . for an ordinary pulsar with the spin period @xmath114  s , @xmath115  g  cm@xmath68 , and helium surface we would have the surface mass loss @xmath117 in @xmath118 yr , too small to affect the cooling of a star with the initial helium layer of @xmath119 . for a pulsar with much higher magnetic field and/or faster rotation",
    "the effect may be stronger and affects the cooling .",
    "we have extended the scenario of neutron star cooling proposed by gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004a ) taking into account the effects of accreted envelopes and crustal singlet - state pairing of neutrons . as stressed in section [ introduction ] , this scenario is different from the minimal cooling scenario of page et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .",
    "the general idea of the minimal cooling scheme is that the enhanced neutrino emission , required for the interpretation of observation of neutron stars coldest for their age , is provided by the neutrino emission due to cooper pairing of neutrons . in this case",
    "the direct urca process or similar enhanced neutrino processes in kaon - condensed , pion - condensed , or quark matter can be forbidden in neutron stars of all masses .    as in gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , the proposed cooling scenario imposes stringent constraints on the density dependence of the critical temperature @xmath73 for triplet - state neutron pairing in the stellar core .",
    "they result from the comparison of theoretical cooling curves with the data on the three most important `` testing sources '' , psr j0205 + 6449 , rx j0007.0 + 7303 , and the vela pulsar ( sect .",
    "[ physics ] ) . by tuning our phenomenological model of triplet - state neutron pairing in the stellar core",
    "we obtain a noticeable dependence of the cooling on neutron star mass .",
    "it enables us to explain all the data by single combination of models for nucleon superfluidity . assuming the presence of accreted envelopes we obtain two additional parameters to regulate the cooling , which are the initial envelope mass @xmath100 and its characteristic burning time @xmath98 ( chang & bildsten 2003 ) .",
    "our interpretation implies the presence of moderately strong proton pairing ( @xmath8  k ) and moderate triplet - state neutron pairing ( with @xmath120  k ) in neutron star cores .",
    "also , we have taken into account the effect of strong singlet - state neutron pairing ( @xmath121  k ) in the stellar crust . however , as shown in sects .",
    "[ low - mass ] and [ accr ] , the effect of crustal superfluidity is unimportant for cooling middle - aged neutron stars with moderately strong proton pairing in their cores .",
    "we need proton superfluidity to explain the observations of the neutron stars hottest for their age . however , in contrast to the cooling scenario of gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004a ) , our new cooling scenario does not require too strong proton pairing .",
    "in fact , we can explain the observations of the old and warmest stars , psr b105552 and rx j0720.43125 , by treating them as low - mass neutron stars ( without accreted envelopes ) with moderately strong proton pairing in their cores .",
    "such phenomenological models for proton pairing are consistent with recent microscopic calculations of proton critical temperatures by zuo et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and takatsuka & tamagaki   ( 2004 ) .",
    "the young and hottest neutron stars , rx j08224300 and 1e 1207.45209 , can also be treated as low - mass stars with the same moderate proton superfluidity in their cores but assuming the presence of accreted envelopes .",
    "the smaller the mass of the envelope , required for the interpretation of these sources , the stronger proton pairing should be assumed .    as discussed above ,",
    "we need neutron pairing nt1 ( or similar ) to explain the observations of the stars coldest for their age .",
    "however , as has been demonstrated by gusakov et al .",
    "( 2004b ) , cooling curves are not too sensitive to exchanging neutron and proton superfluidities ( @xmath122 ) in neutron star cores .",
    "therefore , we would also be able to explain the data in the scenario with moderately strong neutron and moderate proton pairing in the stellar cores .",
    "neutron star cooling can also be affected by surface magnetic fields and by some reheating mechanisms in neutron star interiors .",
    "we have not discussed the effects of magnetic fields ( although they are incorporated in our cooling code ) .",
    "the main reason is that these effects are weaker than the effects discussed above ( for ordinary cooling isolated neutron stars of non - magnetar type ; see , e.g. , yakovlev et al .",
    "2002 for a detailed discussion of this point ) . internal reheating mechanisms ( see , e.g. , page 1998a , b , and references therein ) , for instance , the reheating due to the viscous dissipation of differential rotation , are relatively weak and model dependent ; they become important at the photon cooling stage .",
    "no reheating is required to explain the data in our cooling scenario . what is more important , that most elaborated model equations of state of dense matter ( akmal , pandharipande & ravenhall  1998 ) predict the operation of the direct urca process in most massive stable neutron stars .",
    "this should lead to the existence of new classes of cooling neutron stars .",
    "the scenario with the open direct urca process ( which can be called the _ extended minimal cooling scenario _ ) has been studied by gusakov et al .",
    "( 2005 ) .",
    "it is important that the same physics of neutron star interiors , which is tested by observations of isolated ( cooling ) neutron stars , can also be tested by observations of accreting neutron stars in soft x - ray transients ( e.g. , yakovlev , levenfish & haensel 2003 ) basing on the hypothesis of deep crustal heating of such stars ( brown , bildsten & rutledge 1998 ) by pycnonuclear reactions in accreted matter ( haensel & zdunik 1990 ) .",
    "the observations of soft x - ray transients in quiescent states indicate ( yakovlev , levenfish & gnedin 2005 ) the existence of rather cold neutron stars ( first of all , sax j1808.43658 ) inconsistent with the model of neutron star structure proposed in the present paper",
    ". however , these observational indications are currently inconclusive ( e.g. , yakovlev et al .",
    "if confirmed in future observations , they could give stronger evidence against the proposed scenario than new observations of cooling neutron stars .",
    "in this case the extended minimal cooling scenario may appear to be more perspective .",
