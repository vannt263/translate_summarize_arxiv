    "an incredibly wide range of physical processes are believed to be influential in the formation of galaxies .",
    "some of these processes are well understood , for example , the build up of dark matter haloes through mergers or the accretion of smaller units ; the formation of haloes has been studied extensively using n - body simulations and can be described analytically with a reasonable degree of success ( e.g. lacey & cole 1993 , 1994 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "we are still some distance away from being able to simulate the formation of stars .",
    "an impressive initial step in this direction has been taken by abel @xmath0(2002 ) with a simulation that leads up to the formation of the first star in the universe . however , the conditions in this calculation are much simpler than would be typical for the formation of the bulk of the stars in the universe and the simulation is stopped once additional physics not currently included in the calculation , such as radiative transfer , become important",
    ".    the absence of a complete theory of star formation need not be an obstacle to the development of a theory of galaxy formation .",
    "one can take a phenomenological approach in which a physically motivated recipe is adopted to describe star formation within a galaxy .",
    "the recipe will inevitably contain one or more uncertain parameters but these can be fixed by comparing model predictions with observational data .    adopting this pragmatic approach ,",
    "two techniques have been developed to model the formation and evolution of galaxies .",
    "the first of these is the direct simulation of gravitational instability and gas dynamics .",
    "the second class of technique is semi - analytic modelling ( kauffmann @xmath01993 ; cole @xmath01994 ) .",
    "in such models , the merger trees of dark matter haloes can either be grown using a monte - carlo algorithm or they can be extracted from an n - body simulation .",
    "the gas physics , namely shock heating , radiative cooling , star formation and supernova feedback ( along with galaxy mergers ) , is followed using approximations and simple rules .",
    "the two techniques have complementary pros and cons .",
    "direct simulations do not require the specialised assumptions that are necessary in the semi - analytic models , e.g. the imposition of spherical symmetry in the calculation of the gas cooling time . on the other hand ,",
    "semi - analytic models are fast and flexible , allowing a wide range of parameter space to be explored . the modular structure of the semi - analytic models means that new prescriptions for processes such as star formation can be readily evaluated .    in certain respects ,",
    "the two techniques are actually very similar .",
    "the direct simulation approach necessarily breaks down at some level because of the finite resolution that is attainable .",
    "it is not possible to achieve the sub - parsec resolution needed to simulate star formation in a cosmologically representative volume .",
    "coupled with the lack of knowledge of the relevant micro - physics , this means that recipes like those used in the semi - analytic models have to be deployed in order to produce a fully specified model .",
    "the first comparisons of the two techniques have recently been carried out ( benson @xmath02001a ; helly @xmath02002 ; yoshida @xmath02002 ) .",
    "these studies considered the rate at which gas cools in sph simulations and in `` stripped - down '' semi - analytic models in which star formation and feedback have been switched off .",
    "the two approaches are in remarkably good agreement , which inspires confidence in the cooling model adopted in the semi - analytic schemes .",

    "the shaded region shows an estimate based on the analysis of sdss data in blanton @xmath0(2000 ) ( see norberg @xmath02002 for full details ) . in the right panel , a combination of 2dfgrs redshifts and 2mass photometry was used to estimate the near infrared luminosity function ( cole @xmath02001 ) .",

    ", scaledwidth=102.0% ]        in the phenomenological approach to galaxy formation , the values of the parameters in the recipes that describe processes such as star formation and feedback have to be specified to produce model predictions .",
    "this task is performed by comparing the model predictions to a subset of the available observational data .",
    "different groups of modellers have different priorities when attempting to reproduce the data .",
    "the munich group , for example , has attached most importance to matching the slope and zero point of tully & fisher s ( 1977 ) correlation between the luminosity and rotation speed of disk dominated galaxies .",
    "the durham group instead try hardest to match the form of the present day galaxy luminosity function .",
    "the luminosity function is the most basic description of the galaxy population and is now known to a high level of accuracy in the optical from the 2dfgrs ( norberg @xmath02002 ) and sdss ( blanton @xmath02000 ) and in the near - infrared from 2mass photometry ( cole @xmath02001 ; kochanek @xmath02001 ) .",
    "the predictions of the fiducial model of cole @xmath0(2000 ) are compared with these recent estimates of the local luminosity function in fig",
    "although most weight is given to reproducing the luminosity function when setting model parameters , matching other datasets , such as the tully - fisher relation , the distribution of disk scale lengths , the metallicity of gas in spiral disks and of stars in ellipticals , and the gas fraction in spiral disks , is also important .",
    "this greatly restricts the viable range of parameter space of the models .",
    "one criticism levelled at semi - analytic models that has entered into popular folklore is the inability of the models to match the zeropoint of the tully - fisher relation at the same time as reproducing the break in the luminosity function at @xmath2 .",
    "the tully - fisher relation of the fiducial model of cole @xmath0is compared with the observed relation in fig .",
    "2 . the solid line shows the model prediction when the rotation speed at the half - mass radius of the disk is plotted ; the dashed line shows how the zeropoint shifts when the rotation speed of the halo at the virial radius is plotted instead , which is much closer to the observed zeropoint .",
    "the shift is around 20% - 30% , which is comparable to the accuracy one might expect in the calculation of the rotation speed at the half - mass radius .",
    "this depends upon several effects , such as the self gravity of the baryons and their gravitational influence on the halo dark matter .",
    ", plotted as a function of luminosity .",
    "the solid line shows the model predictions taken from benson @xmath0(2001b ) .",
    "the dotted lines show the poisson errors derived from the pair counts .",
    "the symbols show the subsequent measurements made from the 2dfgrs ( norberg @xmath02001 ) . in this case , the errors are estimated from mock 2dfgrs catalogues constructed from n - body simulations and include sample variance .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    now that we have arrived at a fully specified model by comparing the output against a subset of the observations to fix the model parameters , we can make predictions for other quantities .",
    "benson @xmath0(2000a , b ; 2001b ) populated a high resolution n - body simulation with galaxies using the semi - analytic model of cole @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation gives the spatial distribution of galaxies and allows their clustering to be measured .",
    "remarkably , without any further adjustment to the model parameters , benson @xmath0found that the fiducial @xmath3cdm model of cole @xmath0predicts a correlation function that is in extremely good agreement with that measured for apm galaxies ( baugh 1996 ) .",
    "this is particularly noteworthy as the galaxy correlation function is close to a power law , whereas the correlation function of the dark matter shows considerable curvature .",
    "benson @xmath0(2000b ; 2001 ) presented predictions for the dependence of clustering strength on luminosity in the same model and found an approximately linear dependence of correlation length on luminosity ; galaxies six times more luminous than @xmath2 have a correlation length @xmath4 longer than that predicted for @xmath2 galaxies . at the time , the picture emerging from the data was unclear .",
    "this has now been resolved by measurements from the 2dfgrs ( norberg @xmath02001 ) and sdss ( zehavi @xmath0 2002 ) , which are in reasonable agreement with the trend predicted by the semi - analytic models .",

    "the @xmath5-band luminosity of a galaxy gives a reasonable indication of its stellar mass .",
    "the output from the semi - analytic model suggests that the scatter in the stellar mass@xmath7@xmath5-band magnitude relation is a factor of @xmath8 , showing the relative insensitivity to star formation history .",
    "it is important to make a fair comparison between observational estimates and theoretical predictions for stellar mass .",
    "the stellar mass inferred from the @xmath5-band light is sensitive to the choice of imf .",
    "also , one needs to be clear whether recycling of gas is included i.e. whether the quantity under consideration is the mass locked up in stars or the total mass that had been turned into stars ( some of which is subsequently expelled in stellar winds and supernovae ) .",
    "cole @xmath0(2001 ) estimated the stellar mass function from the @xmath1-band luminosity function ( shown by the symbols in fig .",
    "4 ) , and found that only a small fraction of the baryons in the universe , perhaps as little as @xmath9 , is actually locked up in stars .",

    "4 . there is a steady increase in the typical stellar mass with time ; the value of @xmath10 increases by a factor of @xmath8 between @xmath11 and the present .",
    "the observable counterpart to the stellar mass function , the _ observer _ frame @xmath12band luminosity function shows more complex evolution ( fig .",
    "this is due to band shifting .    * summary * we have given an outline of the semi - analytic approach to modelling galaxy formation .",
    "this technique is complementary to direct simulation of the relevant gas dynamic processes .",
    "in fact , both methods rely upon physically motivated recipes to deal with star formation and feedback .",
    "the model predicts strong evolution in the mass of stellar systems , with more than an order of magnitude increase in the abundance of @xmath13 systems between @xmath11 and the present day .",
    "constraints on these predictions are now beginning to emerge , with the advent of the first results from deep , near - infrared photometry ( see , for example , drory @xmath02001 , and the contributions by drory and by papovich @xmath0to this volume ) .",
