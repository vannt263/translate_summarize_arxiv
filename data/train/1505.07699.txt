    "parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) characterize the structure of hadrons in terms of their fundamental constituents  quark and gluon partons .",
    "they play a crucial role in describing high energy scattering experiments involving hadrons . according to the qcd factorization theorem  @xcite ,",
    "the hadronic cross section for simple processes such as inclusive deep inelastic scattering and drell - yan processes can be computed as a convolution of the partonic cross section and the pdfs .",
    "whereas the former is perturbatively calculable , the latter are intrinsically non - perturbative and difficult to compute . in the field - theoretic language , the pdfs are defined in terms of non - local light - cone correlators , which are intrinsically minkowskian and therefore forbid a direct lattice simulation .",
    "currently the extraction of pdfs relies on a suitable parametrization and fitting of the parameters to experimental or lattice data  @xcite .",
    "recent developments  @xcite showed that the light - cone parton distribution can be directly extracted from the large momentum limit of the hadronic matrix element of a spacelike correlator , which is known as the quasi parton distribution .",
    "the quasi parton distribution does not have a real time dependence , and thus can be simulated on the lattice .",
    "moreover , it has the same infrared ( ir ) behavior as the light - cone parton distribution .",
    "its connection to the light - cone parton distribution can be established as a perturbative matching condition , which can also be viewed as a factorization . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we derived the matching condition at one - loop level for the non - singlet quark distribution .",
    "we showed explicitly that the soft divergences are canceled both for the quasi and for the light - cone distribution .",
    "the collinear divergences are the same for both distributions as well .",
    "we also presented the one - loop matching factor that transforms the frame dependence of the quasi distribution into the renormalization scale dependence of the light - cone distribution .",
    "the factorization in ref .",
    "@xcite was given for the bare quasi quark distribution , where all fields and couplings entering the quasi distribution definition are bare ones .",
    "however , both the light - cone and the quasi distribution contain ultraviolet ( uv ) divergences and therefore need renormalization .",
    "in contrast to the renormalization of local operators , where all uv divergences can be removed by local counterterms , the renormalization of a non - local operator matrix element such as the parton distribution is rather distinct and less well understood .",
    "first , it contains uv divergences associated with coefficients that do not have a polynomial structure ; second , there exist extra unphysical singularity structures , e.g. the light - cone singularities in the light - cone quark distribution or the axial singularities in the quasi quark distribution .",
    "these issues need to be properly addressed , in order to obtain a meaningful renormalized parton distribution .",
    "the renormalization properties of the light - cone quark distribution can be conveniently studied in the covariant feynman gauge , as pointed out in ref .",
    "nevertheless , the choice of light - cone gauge provides a simpler picture in that the distribution reduces to the biproduct of two quark fields , and the renormalization also becomes more straightforward .",
    "the disadvantage of this gauge choice is that the treatment of light - cone singularities is not clear _",
    "a priori_. there have been a number of papers discussing the regularization of light - cone singularities , or of similar singularities in more general axial gauges  @xcite .",
    "given the similarity between the quasi and the light - cone distributions , it is natural that the renormalization of quasi quark distributions also becomes more straightforward in the axial gauge .",
    "there is , however , an important difference between the light - cone and the quasi distribution with respect to their uv behavior . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have pointed out this difference : for the light - cone distribution , the momentum fraction is defined as @xmath0 , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the plus - momenta for the quark in the loop and the initial quark , respectively .",
    "the light - cone momentum fraction is restricted to @xmath3 $ ] , and the momentum @xmath4 can roughly be power - counted as @xmath5 with @xmath6 being a uv cutoff .",
    "the uv divergences in the light - cone parton distribution are then genuine uv divergences to which the usual renormalization procedure can be applied .",
    "in contrast , the momentum fraction for the quasi distribution is defined as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is a space - like vector , and is chosen to be along the @xmath9-direction in ref .",
    "the self energy correction to the quasi distribution has the same uv behavior as in the light - cone distribution , since all components of the loop momentum are integrated over .",
    "however , the vertex correction behaves differently , since the quasi momentum fraction @xmath10 , or equivalently , the @xmath9-component of the loop momentum @xmath11 , is left unintegrated in the vertex correction . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quasi momentum fraction is no longer restricted to @xmath3 $ ] , it can extend from @xmath12 $ ] . therefore leaving @xmath10 unintegrated",
    "reduces the power of uv divergences , and leads to a uv convergent vertex correction at one - loop .",
    "of course , the uv divergences appear when going beyond one - loop .",
    "however , as we will see , they can be subdivergences coming from subdiagrams only , not overall divergences .",
    "consequently , all uv divergences in the ( axial gauge ) vertex correction can be removed by counterterms for subdiagrams from the interaction and therefore do not affect the renormalization of the quasi quark distribution ; the renormalization of the quasi quark distribution then reduces to the renormalization of two quark fields in the axial gauge , provided that the non - trivial complication due to the choice of axial gauge does not matter .",
    "we explicitly show that this is indeed the case at two - loop order .",
    "we will focus in particular on the unpolarized non - singlet quasi quark distribution . by investigating the one - loop corrections to the quasi quark distribution",
    ", we find an equivalence between the self energy correction of the quasi quark distribution and the correction to the heavy - light quark vector current in heavy quark effective theory ( hqet ) , so that the uv divergences in the former can be renormalized as the renormalization of the latter .",
    "based on this observation and the one - to - one correspondence between the two - loop diagrams , we then assume an equivalence between the uv divergences of the two - loop self energy in the quasi quark distribution and of the two - loop corrections of the heavy - light quark current , and discuss the two - loop uv divergence structure of the vertex correction and the renormalization of the quasi quark distribution . to simplify our calculation",
    ", we choose dimensional regularization for uv divergences throughout this paper . in this way",
    ", the linear divergence present in a cutoff regularization is ignored . the result presented in this paper",
    "therefore shall be viewed as a first step towards a full understanding of the renormalization property of the quasi distribution on the lattice .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 , we briefly review the one - loop calculation performed in the axial gauge in ref .",
    "@xcite , and discuss its connection to the feynman gauge computation .",
    "we also present a renormalization formula for the quasi quark distribution , and give the one - loop renormalization factor that renders the quasi quark distribution uv finite . in sec . 3",
    ", we consider the two - loop correction and renormalization of the quasi quark distribution .",
    "also some discussions on its renormalization beyond two - loop are given .",
    "4 is our conclusion .",
    "let us start by recalling the definition of the quasi quark distribution .",
    "for the unpolarized quark density , it is given as  @xcite [ qunpoldef ] q(x , , p^z ) = ^_- e^izk^z p|(0 , 0 _ , z ) ^z ( -ig^z_0 dz a^z(0 , 0 _ , z ) ) ( 0 ) |p  , where we have chosen dimensional regularization for potential uv divergences , and @xmath13 denotes the renormalization scale dependence .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , we computed the one - loop correction to the unpolarized quasi quark distribution in the axial gauge @xmath14 .",
    "the advantage of this gauge is that the gauge link in eq .",
    "( [ qunpoldef ] ) reduces to unity , and the contributing feynman diagrams become simple .",
    "the disadvantage is that it is non - covariant , and the prescription for the axial gauge singularity is not clear _ a priori_. since the definition eq .",
    "( [ qunpoldef ] ) is gauge invariant , we can carry out the computation in any gauge .",
    "a convenient choice for the investigation of its renormalization properties is the covariant feynman gauge , as mentioned in the introduction . in the feynman gauge ,",
    "the contributing diagrams are given by those in fig .",
    "[ 1loopfeyngauge ] .",
    "actually there is a straightforward correspondence between the diagrams in fig .",
    "[ 1loopfeyngauge ] and the individual terms in the axial gauge result .",
    "for example , the diagrams in the second row of fig .",
    "[ 1loopfeyngauge ] correspond to the contribution to the vertex correction from the @xmath15 term , the @xmath16 term , and the @xmath17 term of the axial gauge gluon numerator , respectively .",
    "let us write down the contribution of each feynman gauge diagram .",
    "we start from the vertex corrections , _",

    "@xcite . after a feynman parametrization and integration over @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    ", we have the following contribution to the one - loop quasi distribution @xmath22       +       the second diagram yields @xmath23 and leads to the one - loop correction ( together with the conjugate diagram ) @xmath24    note that there is no uv divergence in the above results .",
    "this is because the momentum fraction @xmath10 is left unintegrated .",
    "as @xmath10 can extend between @xmath12 $ ] , leaving it unintegrated reduces the power of uv divergence , and therefore leads to a uv convergent result in the one - loop vertex correction . if one integrates over the momentum fraction @xmath10 , as is done for the self energy diagrams in the first row of fig .",
    "[ 1loopfeyngauge ] , one will find a logarithmic uv divergence , in accordance with the usual uv power counting .",

    "now let us look at the self energy diagrams in the first row of fig .",
    "[ 1loopfeyngauge ] , where we integrate over all components of the loop momentum .",
    "since we are interested in the renormalization properties of the quasi distribution , we need the uv divergent part of the diagrams only .",
    "the first diagram is the usual feynman gauge quark self energy diagram , it leads to the following contribution to the wave function renormalization factor @xmath28 in dimensional regularization ( @xmath29 ) and @xmath30 scheme [ z11result ] z_11=- , where @xmath31 accounts for the constant associated with @xmath32 in the @xmath30 scheme .",
    "the second diagram yields @xmath33 in dimensional regularization , this leads to the following contribution to @xmath28 [ z12result ] z_12=. to understand how the wilson line self energy diagram contributes , let us expand the quasi distribution definition in coordinate space eq .",

    "this leads to the prescription @xmath44 for the double pole @xmath45 .",
    "the above derivation is also formally consistent with the intuitive understanding of the third diagram in the first row of fig .",

    "( [ sigma13 ] ) and the prescription for the double pole , we obtain the following contribution to @xmath28 from the wilson line self energy diagram [ z13result ] z_13=.    now we can write down the renormalization of quasi quark distribution .",

    "the factor in the first bracket then cancels the remained uv divergence in the parton distribution .    from the one - loop results above",
    ", we can see that there is no uv divergence in the vertex correction ( the second row of fig .",

    "an interesting observation is that the diagrams in the first row of fig .",
    "[ 1loopfeyngauge ] are in one - to - one correspondence with the one - loop correction to the heavy - light quark vector current @xmath52 in the hqet .",
    "also the wilson line propagator @xmath53 is the same as @xmath54 in the heavy quark propagator , except that the vector @xmath8 in the former is space - like , whereas the velocity @xmath55 in the latter is time - like .",

    "<S> recent developments showed that light - cone parton distributions can be studied by investigating the large momentum limit of the hadronic matrix elements of spacelike correlators , which are known as quasi parton distributions . like a light - cone parton distribution </S>",
    "<S> , a quasi parton distribution also contains ultraviolet divergences and therefore needs renormalization . </S>",
    "<S> the renormalization of non - local operators in general is not well understood . however , in the case of quasi quark distribution , the bilinear quark operator with a straight - line gauge link appears to be multiplicatively renormalizable by the quark wave function renormalization in the axial gauge . </S>",
    "<S> we first show that the renormalization of the self energy correction to the quasi quark distribution is equivalent to that of the heavy - light quark vector current in heavy quark effective theory at one - loop order . assuming this equivalence at two - loop order </S>",
    "<S> , we then show that the multiplicative renormalizability of the quasi quark distribution is true at two - loop order . </S>"
