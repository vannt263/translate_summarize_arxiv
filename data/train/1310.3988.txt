    "manganese silicide ( mnsi ) , a model itinerant helimagnet , crystallizes in a b20 structure , whose non - centro - symmetric space group p2@xmath23 allows a helical ( chiral ) magnetic structure .",
    "the phase transition in mnsi from helical to paramagnetic states at @xmath330 reveals some remarkable features such as sharp peaks and shoulders on the high temperature side of the peaks in the heat capacity , thermal expansion , temperature dependence of resistivity and sound absorption  @xcite . as is recognized now the sharp peaks in the above properties indicate a first order nature of the phase transition whereas the origin of the shoulders is still not quite clear  @xcite .",
    "there is some evidence that the shoulders arise from intense helical ( chiral ) fluctuations in the vicinity of the phase transition in mnsi  @xcite .",
    "these fluctuations must be responsible for the first order phase transition in mnsi , symmetry of which principally allows a second order one  @xcite .",
    "the simultaneous disappearance of the shoulder and first order features at the phase transition in mnsi on decreasing temperature supports this conclusion  @xcite .",
    "insulator cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 crystallizes in a complicated structure , which belongs to the same space group p2@xmath23 common to mnsi , and hence permits piezoelectricity  @xcite . on cooling below 60 k cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1",
    "becomes magnetically ordered and demonstrates an enhanced magneto dielectric effect .",
    "the latter implies existence of the magneto electric coupling in the system .",
    "careful structural studies of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 show no measurable structural distortion occurring down 10 k. this means that there is no a spontaneous lattice distortion involved in the magneto electric coupling mechanism .",
    "so a pure electronic coupling should be responsible for the observed magneto dielectric response  @xcite .",
    "these observations predict an incommensurate magnetic structure  @xcite . finally , a helical spin structure in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 was found in a small angle neutron scattering experiment  @xcite .",
    "but despite a similar spin structure , major differences between metallic mnsi and insulating cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 lies in their magnetic moments .",
    "the moments are itinerant in mnsi and local in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "nevertheless the behavior of the heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility at the magnetic phase transitions in mnsi and cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 appears to be very similar .",
    "indeed the heat capacity of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 shows a peak and shoulder on the high temperature side of the peak at the phase transition  @xcite like the heat capacity of mnsi .",
    "actually the difference in nature of the magnetic moments between the two substances noted above reveals itself in a pressure dependence of the phase transition temperature @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath4 of mnsi decreases with pressure and tends to zero , whereas @xmath4 of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 increases with pressure at least up to 2 gpa  @xcite .",
    "it would be of great interest to track an evolution of the features of the phase transitions in both materials in the hope of shedding more light on its nature and the origin of the strongly fluctuating region ( shoulder ) .",
    "the evolution of resistivity in the vicinity of the phase transition in mnsi with pressure was analyzed in  @xcite .",
    "here we report results of a high pressure study of the heat capacity of mnsi and cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and the ac - magnetic susceptibility of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "the data obtained show different pressure but similar temperature dependences of specific features of the phase transition , therefore confirming the classical character of the strongly fluctuating region and the fluctuation nature of the first order transition in mnsi at ambient and moderate pressures .",
    "single crystals of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 of size 0.5 - 1.0 mm were grown by a gas transport technique in a @xmath5c temperature gradient using a 2:1 cuo / seo@xmath0 mixture and cucl@xmath62h@xmath0o as a transport agent .",
    "high pressures were created in a small teflon capsule filled with liquid and inserted in a miniature toroid - type clamped device  @xcite .",
    "experiments with mnsi were performed with a cylinder - piston type clamped device .",
    "the specific heat c(t ) at high pressure was measured by ac - calorimetry technique as described earlier  @xcite . for ac - calorimetry measurements a flat zig - zag heater made of constantan wire of 12 @xmath7 in diameter",
    "was glued to one side of a plate - like crystal ( @xmath8 ) .",
    "this heater was at the same time a sensitive strain gauge and the change of its resistance under pressure allowed us to calculate the change in length and hence compressibility of the cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 sample at room temperature as described earlier  @xcite .",
    "the coil system for magnetic ac - susceptibility measurements @xmath9 was placed inside the teflon capsule .",
    "pressure was measured by monitoring the superconducting transition temperature of pb located near cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 sample .",
    "[ fig1]a , b display the temperature dependence of the heat capacity and the magnetic susceptibility of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and mnsi in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition at ambient pressure .",

    "the two substances under study belong to different classes of solids .",
    "cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 is a covalent insulator with local magnetic moments , whereas metallic mnsi is an itinerant magnet .",
    "normally the exchange interaction , giving rise to magnetic order in a system with local magnet moments depends on inter - particle distances in such a way that increases a phase transition temperature with pressure .",
    "this is what happens with @xmath4 of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 with applied pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]a ) . in the case of itinerant magnetics",
    "an energy gain occurring at magnetic ordering arises as a result of competition between the exchange interaction and electron kinetic energy .",
    "their changes on compression lead to a decrease of the transition temperature in itinerant magnets with pressure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2]b ) despite the mentioned difference both substances demonstrate a surprising similarity in behavior of magnetic and thermodynamic properties at the phase transition ( figs .",
    "[ fig1]a , b ) .",
    "probably , this implies that the longitudinal spin fluctuations typical of the weak itinerant magnets do not contribute much to the discussed properties .",
    "remarkably the similarity between cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and mnsi found at ambient pressure can be seen at high pressures as well , if one uses temperature as a variable . indeed , analyzing figs .",
    "[ fig4 ] and  [ fig5 ] , which depict the behavior of the anomalous part of heat capacity of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and mnsi at different pressures and temperatures , one can see that the heat capacity peaks and shoulders clearly change at decreasing temperature .",
    "the shoulder becomes less and less prominent and completely disappeared in case of mnsi .",
    "this conclusion is obviously supported by resistivity measurements  @xcite ( fig .  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "a variation of the temperature interval @xmath15 between the peak and the maximum of the shoulder may serve as some sort of semi quantitative measure of this process as illustrated in figures  [ fig1 ] and  [ fig7 ] .",
    "taking into account these data , phase diagrams of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and mnsi were constructed in fig .",
    "as can be seen , the splitting of the two characteristic features of the heat capacity curve ( peak and shoulder ) decreases along the phase transition line towards lower temperatures , irrespective of the different pressure dependence .",
    "narrowing the splitting is a consequence of shrinking the heat capacity anomaly ( shoulder ) along with the transition temperature reduction .",
    "all this helps to identify the shoulder as a product of classical fluctuations . at the same time , in case of mnsi the sharp peaks , which classify the transition as first order cease to exist at low temperatures almost simultaneously with the disappearance of shoulder .",
    "then with further decrease of temperature the heat capacity peaks are progressively reduced in size and width ( figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] ,  [ fig6 ] ) .",
    "this behavior leads us to claim the existence of a tricritical point in the phase diagram of mnsi , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7]b , in agreement with conclusions of ref .  @xcite .",
    "the heat capacity of helical magnets cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and mnsi has been studied at high pressures by the ac - calorimetric technique .",
    "the magnetic ac - susceptibility was measured in the vicinity of the magnetic phase transition in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 .",
    "the helical phase transition temperature @xmath4 increases with pressure in case of cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 , which is typical of systems with local magnetic moments , whereas @xmath4 of mnsi drops on compression in accordance with standard behavior observed in itinerant magnets .",
    "the variation of two characteristic features of the heat capacity at the phase transitions of both substances ( peak and shoulder ) were investigated at high pressures . despite the different nature of the magnetic moments in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and mnsi",
    "these features behave in a similar way when studied as a function of temperature .",
    "so probably the longitudinal spin fluctuations can be ignored in an analysis of the phase transition in mnsi .",
    "the shoulders shrink with decreasing temperature , which suggests that they arise from classical fluctuations . in the case of mnsi",
    "the peak and shoulder of the heat capacity disappear simultaneously probably signifying the existence of a tricritical point and confirming the fluctuation nature of the first order phase transition in cu@xmath0oseo@xmath1 and mnsi .",
