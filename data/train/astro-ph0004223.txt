    "gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) are short and intense flashes of cosmic high energy ( @xmath3 10 kev@xmath1610 gev ) photons .",
    "the study of grbs was revolutionized in 1997 when the italian - dutch @xmath17ray satellite bepposax started providing positions of some grbs with an accuracy of a few arcminutes within a few hours after the burst .",
    "this made the multi - wavelength observations of the long - lived emission , known as afterglow of grb , at longer wavelengths as a routine .",
    "such observations are of crucial importance for understanding and constraining the active emission mechanisms of grbs as well as for the study of the nature , structure and composition of surroundings . for this ,",
    "early light curves of grb afterglows need to be densely sampled for long time intervals .",
    "a huge amount of observing time is therefore required on optical telescopes .",
    "since the optical transient ( ot ) of a grb has generally apparent @xmath1 magnitude between 18 to 22 , if it is detected within a day or so after the burst , the 1-m class optical telescopes equipped with modern ccd detector are capable of observing them .",
    "such telescopes are not only large in number throughout the world but also less in demand compared to 2-m class or larger size optical telescopes .",
    "the large amount of observing time is therefore available on them ( cf .",
    "sagar 2000 for detailed discussions ) .",
    "the 1-m class optical telescopes equipped with ccd detector , thus , can contribute to the world - class science in an emerging front - line research area of grb .",
    "we at u.p .",
    "state observatory ( upso ) , nainital , therefore , started the optical follow - up observations of the grb afterglows in january 1999 under an international collaborative programme coordinated by one of us ( ajct ) .",
    "so far , successful photometric observations have been carried out for 4 grb afterglows from upso , nainital .",
    "the upso photometric observations for earlier 3 events namely grb 990123 , grb 991208 and grb 991216 have been presented by sagar et al .",
    "( 1999 , 2000 ) .",
    "such observations for the grb000301c are presented here .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that first earliest optical observations of grb 000301c have been carried out by us .",
    "an introduction to the grb 000301c studied here is given below .",

    "grb 000301c therefore joins the group of grb 991208 ( see hurley et al .",

    "the positions were of such accuracy ( @xmath350 arcmin@xmath15 in this case ) that it led to the successful identification of radio , millimeter , optical and near - ir afterglows , and eventually to the measurement of its redshift .",

    "the three asm energy channels showed the strongest response in the 5  12 kev band , reaching a peak flux of 3.7@xmath180.7 crab in 1 s time bin .",
    "jensen et al . ( 2000 ) derived a peak flux of 6.3@xmath19 erg @xmath20 in 0.25 s time bin in the 25  100 kev energy range and the hardness ratio @xmath21 for the burst .",
    "it has a sharp rise and a relatively slow decline .",
    "duration ( full width at half maximum ) of the profile at trigger of the burst is only @xmath3 2 s. the detection of the grb 000301c ot was reported first by fynbo et al .",

    "the cause of the short term variability is not understood .",
    "however , it makes difficult the determination of break - time while fitting jet model in the light curve of the afterglow emission .",

    "several short exposures up to a maximum of 15 minutes were generally given . in order to improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the ot , the data have been binned in @xmath34 pixel@xmath15 and also all images of a night",
    "have been stacked after correcting them for bias , non - uniformity in the pixels and cosmic ray events .",

    "only one image in each @xmath0 and @xmath2 filters could be taken on 2000 march 3 with corresponding exposure times of 30 and 10 minutes respectively . as the ot is close to a bright star ,",

    "the observed flux decay constant at early times agrees well with the predicted ones given in table 2 while exactly opposite is the case at late times for spherical afterglow emission .",

    "the value of @xmath42 is the same for both spherical and jet models . since the observed values of @xmath40 for late times agree with the predicted values of @xmath41 and hence to the values of @xmath40 in jet model",

    "redshift determination of @xmath27 ( castro et al .",
    "2000 ) for the grb 000301c afterglow yields a minimum luminosity distances of 16.6 gpc for a standard friedmann cosmological model with hubble constant @xmath43 = 65 km / s / mpc , cosmological density parameter @xmath44 = 0.2 and cosmological constant @xmath45 = 0 ( if @xmath46 then the inferred distances would increase ) .",

    "( 2000 ) respectively .",
    "theoretical models predict that brightness of the prompt optical flash can be as bright as 9  10 mag ( sari & piran 1999 ) ; as was observed in the case of the grb 990123 , the only prompt optical emission detected so far . at the optical distance of grb 000301c",
    ", this implies a peak optical luminosity of @xmath56 times the solar luminosity , if the prompt optical emission is of similar order .",
    "this is about a million times the luminosity of a normal galaxy and about a thousand times the luminosity of the brightest quasars known .",
    "the present energy and @xmath57 estimates imply a jet opening angle of @xmath58 radian , where @xmath59 is the number density ( in units of @xmath60 ) of the ambient medium .",
    "this means that the actual energy released from the grb 000301c is reduced by a factor of @xmath61 relative to the isotropic value and becomes @xmath62 ergs .    of the over dozen grbs with known redshifts , six with total fluence energies",
    "@xmath12 20 kev in excess of 10@xmath63 erg ( assuming isotropic emission ) are grb 000301c ( discussed here ) ; grb 991216 and grb 991208 ( sagar et al .",

    "recent observations suggest that grbs are associated with stellar deaths , and not with quasars or the nuclei of galaxies as some grbs are found off - set from their host galaxy .",
    "however , release of huge amount of isotropic energy of @xmath64 erg or more is essentially incompatible with the popular stellar death models ( coalescence of neutron stars and death of massive stars ) .",
    "recent observations seem to indicate non - isotropic emission as the most plausible way to reduce the enormous energy release . indeed",
    ", almost all energetic sources in astrophysics such as pulsars , quasars and accreting stellar black holes display jet - like geometry and hence , non - isotropic emission .",
    "beaming reduces the estimated energy by a factor of 10 - 300 , depending upon the size of its opening angle ( sari et al .",

    "prompt @xmath4ray emission light curve of the grb 000301c burst shows , unlike most of the grb events , only one strong peak with a flux of 3.7@xmath180.7 crab in the 5  12 kev energy range . using optical and near - ir observations",
    ", we obtained the values of flux decay constants and spectral indices .",
    "light curves of the grb 000301c afterglow emissions are peculiar .",
    "the light curves show a steepening superposed by a short term flare type variability which could be detected mainly due to the dense observations in @xmath1 filter . a large fraction of these observations",
    "have been carried out using the 1-m class optical telescopes .",
    "this indicates that in future these telescopes , as large amount of observing time is available on them , will play an important role in understanding the origin of such short term variability in the light curves of grbs during early times . the overall flux decay in observed light curves are well understood in terms of a jet model .",
    "the parameters of the jet model are derived by fitting least square non - linear fit to the light curves obtained after deconvolving the short term variability from the observed light curves .",
    "the flux decay constants at early and late times are 1.2@xmath180.1 and 3.0@xmath180.5 respectively .",
    "the value of jet break time is 7.6@xmath180.5 day . before deriving any further conclusions from the light curve of grb 000301c afterglow ,",
    "we compare it with other well studied grbs . except grb 990123 , grb 990510 and grb 991216 , all exhibit , at both early and late times a single power - law decay , generally @xmath3 1.2 , a value reasonable for spherical expansion in the fireball synchrotron model .",
    "grb 000301c thus becomes the fourth burst for which a strong break in the light curve is clearly observed .",
    "such breaks were observed first in the optical light curves of the afterglow of grb 990123 ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "1999 ; kulkarni et al . 1999 ) and recently in that of grb 990510 ( harrison et al .",

    "1999 ) and grb 991216 ( halpern et al .",
    "2000 , sagar et al .",
    "they have generally been considered as evidence for collimation of the jet - like relativistic grb ejecta in accordance with the prediction by recent theoretical models ( mszros & rees 1999 ; rhoads 1999 ; sari et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "the quasi - simultaneous spectral energy distributions determined in optical and near - ir regions for various epochs indicate that spectral index of the grb 000301c afterglow has not changed significantly during a period of about 35 days after the burst .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is @xmath10 .",
    "however , the early time flux decay constant has varied from 1.2@xmath180.1 to 3.0@xmath180.5 .",
    "a steepening of flux decay constant with no corresponding change in spectral index is attributed to the presence of a jet in the grb 000301c ot .",
    "the jet breaks around 7.6 days after the burst .",
    "redshift determination yields a minimum distance of 16.6 gpc , if one assumes standard friedmann cosmology with @xmath66 km / s / mpc , @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "grb 000301c is thus at cosmological distance and becomes the second farthest amongst the grbs with known distances so far .",
    "considering isotropic energy emission , we estimate enormous amount of the @xmath4ray energy release ( @xmath13 erg ) above 20 kev . this high energy is reduced to @xmath69 erg when effects of non - isotropic emission are considered due to the presence of a jet of an opening angle of 0.15 radian in the grb 000301c .",
    "the peculiarity in the light curves of grb 000301c seems to be due to superposition of a short term achromatic variability over a large frequency range on the overall steepening in the flux of the grb 000301c . in separating the two components of the observed light curves ,",
    "dense as well as multi - wavelength observations during early times have played major role .",
    "such observations of recent grbs have started revealing features which require explanations other than generally accepted so far indicating that there may be yet new surprises in grb afterglows .",

    "<S> the ccd magnitudes in johnson @xmath0 and cousins @xmath1 and @xmath2 photometric passbands are determined for grb 000301c afterglow starting @xmath3 1.5 day after the @xmath4ray burst . in fact we provide the earliest optical observations for this burst . </S>",
    "<S> light curves of the afterglow emissions in @xmath5 and @xmath6 passbands are obtained by combining the present measurements with the published data . </S>",
    "<S> flux decay shows a very uncommon variation relative to other well observed grbs . </S>",
    "<S> overall , there is a steepening of the optical and near - infrared flux decay caused by a geometric and sideways expanding jet . </S>",
    "<S> this is superimposed by a short term variability especially during early time ( @xmath7 days ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cause of variability is not well understood , though it has occurred simultaneously with similar amplitude in all the filters . after removing the superposed flux due to variability , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the early and late time flux decay constants using jet model . </S>",
    "<S> the late time flux decay is the steepest amongst the grb ots observed so far with @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> steepening in the flux decay seems to have started simultaneously around @xmath9 day in all passbands . on the other hand no such variations </S>",

    "<S> the value of spectral index in the optical - near ir region is @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> redshift determination with @xmath11 indicates cosmological origin of the grb having a luminosity distance of 16.6 gpc . </S>",
    "<S> thus it becomes the second farthest amongst the grbs with known distances . </S>",
    "<S> an indirect estimate of the fluence @xmath12 20 kev indicates , if isotropic , @xmath13 ergs of release of energy . the enormous amount of released energy will be reduced , if the radiation is beamed which is the case for this event . using a jet break time of 7.6 days </S>",
    "<S> , we infer a jet opening angle of @xmath3 0.15 radian . </S>",
