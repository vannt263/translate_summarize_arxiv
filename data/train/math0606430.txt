    "the development of effective model reduction techniques is of paramount importance for all areas of engineering .",
    "these include control system design for nonlinear mechanical , chemical and electronic engineering systems , the design of radio - frequency ( rf ) integrated circuits and many others @xcite  @xcite .    in linear system theory ( e.g. see @xcite , @xcite and the references therein ) , the input - output interaction of a system is characterized by the so - called _ gramian _ matrices or _ gramians _ , which can be subsequently used in a model reduction procedure , called balanced truncation @xcite  @xcite .",
    "for general nonlinear systems the notion of gramians and balancing has been derived from the more general concept of controllability and observability ( or _ energy _ ) functions @xcite  @xcite .",
    "however , the calculation of the energy functions is computationally expensive and the result is rarely an explicit solution @xcite , @xcite  @xcite . for these reasons",
    ", it is very difficult to apply this method to large - scale problems @xcite .",
    "several recent research papers , @xcite followed by @xcite ",
    "@xcite , have presented a specific framework for the analysis and model reduction of nonlinear models for the purpose of control termed _ empirical balanced realization_. in the present paper , some shortcomings of this approach as regards the determination of the empirical gramians are detailed in sections 3 and 4 and an improved approach for the computation of the empirical gramians is suggested in section 5 , _",
    "definitions 3,4_. numerical tests are given in section 6 .",
    "as in lall et al .",
    "@xcite , the non - linear system under consideration is of the form : @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are nonlinear functions , the function @xmath10 is regarded as an input signal to the system and the function @xmath11 is an output signal .",
    "a simple idea , used extensively in the analysis of autonomous nonlinear systems , is to compute a trajectory @xmath12 on the time interval @xmath13 $ ] and to consider the integral @xcite @xmath14 as an approximation of the exact gramians for subsequent construction of an appropriate projector ( the superscript @xmath15 denotes transposition ) .",
    "the method proposed in @xcite for general nonautonomous systems stems from this basic idea .",
    "data , taken either from experiments or from numerical simulation and consisting of sampled measurements of @xmath12 and @xmath16 , is used to parametrize the trajectories for the nonlinear system .",
    "the following constructions for empirical controllability and observability gramians are then proposed in @xcite :    let @xmath17 be a set of @xmath18 positive constants , @xmath19  be a set of @xmath20 orthogonal @xmath21 matrices and @xmath22 be the set of standard unit vectors in @xmath23 .",
    "_ definition 1_. let @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 be given sets as described above .",
    "for the system ( [ nl1 ] ) the empirical controllability gramian is defined as :    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is given by @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the state of system ( [ nl1 ] ) corresponding to the impulsive input @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath32 denotes dirac s delta function .",
    "the mean @xmath33 of a function @xmath34 is given as : @xmath35    _ definition 2_. let @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath26 be given sets as described above .",
    "for the system ( [ nl1 ] ) the empirical observability gramian is defined as : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is given by @xmath40 and @xmath41 is the output of system ( [ nl1 ] ) corresponding to the initial condition @xmath42 with input @xmath43 .",
    "the purpose of using the sets @xmath26 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 in _ definitions 1 _ and _ 2 _ is an attempt to ensure that the entire region of feasible values of initial inputs / states is covered and probed .",
    "the set @xmath37 defines the standard directions and the set @xmath36 defines rotations of these directions .",
    "the set @xmath26 introduces different scales for each direction of the initial states / inputs .    in what follows several shortcomings associated with _",
    "definitions 1 _ and _ 2 _ are brought to light and novel proposals for improvement are suggested .",
    "an examination of linear time - varying systems ( ltvs ) in the context of model reduction is both nontrivial and instructive .",
    "the controllability gramian proposed in _",
    "definition 1 _ for a non - autonomous system @xmath44 does not yield the standard controllability gramian for such systems @xcite , @xcite . furthermore",
    ", the derivation of the standard gramian for ltvs provides a motivation for the new improved constructions suitable for nonlinear systems . in what follows , for simplicity ,",
    "only one - dimensional inputs and outputs are considered , i.e. @xmath45 in ( [ nl1 ] ) , ( [ eq2 ] ) . consider a ltvs : @xmath46 the fundamental solution of ( [ eq5 ] ) is defined as the solution of : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the corresponding identity matrix .",
    "for example , if @xmath49 is a constant matrix , ( as for the linear time invariant system  ltis ) then one simply recovers the very well known solution @xmath50 .",
    "the general solution of ( [ eq5 ] ) is : @xmath51 now let @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 . from ( [ eq7 ] )",
    "it follows : @xmath55 and as usual , one can define a controllability operator : @xmath56 and controllability gramian as : @xmath57 from ( [ eq7 ] ) with @xmath58 and @xmath59 it follows @xmath60 and therefore the observability operator can be defined as : @xmath61 and the observability gramian is : @xmath62    strictly speaking , the gramians for ltvs must depend on @xmath63 as shown in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however , for the purposes of model reduction , constant gramians are preferred and the constant versions ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) are used as approximations .",
    "the expressions in ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) are generalisations of the gramians for ltis where @xmath50 @xcite .",
    "another very interesting class of nonlinear systems that it is instructive to examine are the bilinear systems ; moreover a wide class of nonlinear systems ( subject to suitable restrictions @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , may be represented in a bilinear form .",
    "the bilinear system is also interesting because there is an exact solution when the input is a delta - function and thus the gramians ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) can be tested explicitly . consider the following bilinear system : @xmath64    again , it is assumed that all the eigenvalues of @xmath65 have negative real parts .",
    "let the sets employed in _ definition 1 _ be as follows : @xmath17 , @xmath66 and @xmath67 since @xmath45 .",
    "thus the inputs to the system are of the form @xmath68 . the solution to ( [ eq13 ] ) with an input @xmath68 is : @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the unit step function . note that the sum in ( [ eq14 ] ) is finite since @xmath71 is nilpotent by construction @xcite , @xcite .",
    "( @xmath72 corresponds to @xmath73 with @xmath74 , @xmath75 ) .",
    "following from _ definition 1 _ , the controllability gramian is therefore : @xmath76 where @xmath77 since the bilinear system ( [ eq13 ] ) assumes a linear form when the input is zero , the observability gramian is as usual : @xmath78 it is not difficult to prove that the gramians in ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) are solutions to the following lyapunov equations : @xmath79 however , there are the following problems with the gramians in ( [ eq15 ] ) and ( [ eq17 ] ) .",
    "firstly , they do not relate to the known gramians for the bilinear systems @xcite  @xcite , @xcite .",
    "secondly , ( [ eq14 ] ) suggests that the krylov space for the controllability operator is @xmath80 for @xmath81 .",
    "however , the known krylov space @xcite is @xmath82 for @xmath83 .",
    "the nonlinear system in ( [ nl1 ] ) has a rather general form . in @xcite , @xcite it is suggested that the use of the empirical gramians ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) is limited only to control - affine systems . indeed , for example",
    ", for a system , depending quadratically on the input , the square of the delta - function can not be defined .    for the present analysis ,",
    "let the nonlinear systems be of the form : @xmath84 it contains two terms : a _ dynamical _ term ( or drift term ) @xmath85 and a _ source _ term ( or diffusion term ) @xmath86 .",
    "clearly , ltvs systems are of the form in ( [ eq19 ] ) .    instead of considering different inputs and mean values as in _ definitions 1 _ and _ 2 _",
    ", it is more natural to analyse the system in a vicinity of an equilibrium point when @xmath87 . consider the vicinity of an isolated asymptotically stable equilibrium point ( steady  state solution ) which is supposed to be a constant solution and is chosen for simplicity at @xmath88 , i.e. @xmath89 .",
    "it is also assumed that the system does not leave the region of attraction of this equilibrium point when the input is applied for the initial data used .",
    "if the system exhibits multiple steady  state solutions , then the analysis may be applied separately in the vicinity of each solution provided that extra care is taken to ensure that the system does not leave the region of attraction of the corresponding ( asymptotically stable ) equilibrium point .",
    "of course , the constructed gramians will therefore only provide a basis for reduction locally in the vicinity of the selected equilibrium point .    in this work",
    ", it is proposed to make use of an approximation for the most natural object  the fundamental solution @xmath90 of ( [ eq19 ] ) that would generalize the @xmath91 term for linear systems .",
    "this is reasonable since the projection krylov spaces for linear systems are generated by their fundamental solution @xmath91 .",
    "the constructions would , in general , depend on @xmath90 for negative times which is unavoidable . for linear systems , of course , there is a simplification since @xmath92 so this does not present a limitation but in general , @xmath93 , cf .",
    "( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath30 be the solution of ( [ eq19 ] ) with @xmath59 : @xmath94 and with initial condition : @xmath95 it is assumed that the initial condition ( [ eq21 ] ) does not take the system outside the region of attraction of the equilibrium point @xmath88 .",
    "then the state - space average of the nonlinear fundamental solution may be defined as : @xmath96 where the sets @xmath26 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 previously defined for _ definitions 1 _ and _ 2",
    "_ are employed . indeed , for a ltvs , @xmath97 and therefore @xmath98 .",
    "the following constructions of empirical controllability and observability gramians for the nonlinear system ( [ eq19 ] ) are now suggested :    _ definition 3_. for the system in ( [ eq19 ] ) , the _ nonlinear _ controllability gramian is defined as : @xmath99 where @xmath100 is as described in ( [ eq22 ] ) .",
    "of course , this construction requires that @xmath101 is invertible for all @xmath102 .",
    "( [ eq23 ] ) is obviously a generalisation of ( [ eq10 ] ) .",
    "_ definition 4_. for the system in ( [ eq19 ] ) the _ nonlinear _ observability gramian is defined as : @xmath103 where @xmath104 is given by : @xmath105 and @xmath41 is the output which corresponds to an initial state @xmath106 and a zero source term .",
    "the motivation for this construction is as follows :    for a linear output @xmath107 , since @xmath108 the observability gramian ( [ eq12 ] ) is : @xmath109 since @xmath110    then the construction in ( [ eq24 ] ) is confirmed as a generalisation of ( [ eq12 ] ) .    both gramians ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) when applied to ltvs ( or ltis ) thus result in the usual gramians i.e. ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq12 ] ) .",
    "this confirms the motivation for their use in preference to ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "the circuit employed is the nonlinear @xmath111 ladder shown in fig .",
    "1 ( frequently employed as a test circuit for model reduction techniques @xcite  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the example enables comparisons to be made between the existing formulations for empirical gramians and those proposed in this contribution .",
    "the nonlinear resistors ( a diode in parallel with a unit resistor ) have the constitutive relation @xmath112 ( where @xmath113 represents current and @xmath114 represents voltage ) .",
    "the capacitors have unit capacitance .",
    "the input is a current source @xmath115 entering node 1 and the output is the voltage taken at node 1 , fig 2(a ) .",
    "this is an example of a gradient system ( e.g. according to the definition in @xcite ) , since the equations describing the system may be written in the form : @xmath116 where @xmath117^t$ ] , @xmath118 and @xmath119    the function @xmath120 represents a strong lyapunov function for the gradient system as described in @xcite .",
    "this then enables the application of lyapunov stability criterion to show that @xmath121 is an asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the system ( when the source is set to zero ) .",
    "the number of nodes in the system is @xmath122 .",
    "the time interval chosen for consideration is @xmath123 $ ] .",
    "the reduction of the original system to a system of order 3 is implemented using several different methods .    in order to compare the new gramians with the existing constructions for empirical gramians ( _ definitions 1,2 _ ) , a bilinear representation @xcite , @xcite , @xcite of the system in ( [ eq26 ] )  ( [ eq27 ] )",
    "is employed .",
    "the reason for doing this is that an exact solution exists for a bilinear system when subjected to impulsive inputs .",
    "this is of importance in the formation of the gramian as specified in _ definition 1 _ as it necessitates subjecting the system to impulsive inputs .",
    "a bilinear approximation with two terms in the taylor s series expansion is employed .",
    "the resultant bilinear model is of order @xmath124 . for information ,",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) error between the result from the nonlinear model ( [ eq26 ] ) and the full order @xmath125 bilinear approximation ( [ eq13 ] ) is @xmath126 , fig 2(b ) .    as a benchmark ,",
    "consider the simplest reduced model ( of order 3) that which employs only the linear part of the bilinear approximation to form the gramians necessary for balancing .",
    "to be specific , the gramians employed are the solutions of the following lyapunov equations : @xmath127 the rms error in comparison to the full order @xmath125 bilinear model is @xmath128 , fig 2(c ) .",
    "now consider the use of the gramians ( [ eq18 ] ) formed on the basis of _ definitions 1 _ and _ 2 _ with @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 .",
    "the rms error in comparison to the full order @xmath125 bilinear model is @xmath132 , fig 2(d ) .",
    "moreover , it is observed that when @xmath133 , i.e. consisting of only one constant , the reduction process is ill - defined for some values of @xmath134 , e.g. @xmath135 ; @xmath136 ; i.e. the reduced model is unstable .    finally , consider the case where the gramians formed on the basis of _ definitions 3 _ and _ 4 _ are employed for reduction purposes .",
    "the integration over @xmath137 in these constructions is replaced by a discrete summation . the resulting rms error ( in comparison to the original model )",
    "is @xmath138 , fig 2(e ) .",
    "this indicates the superiority of the novel constructions for the purposes of model reduction via a balancing technique .",
    "the paper has proposed new constructions for empirical gramians for subsequent use in a method of model reduction based on balancing. the important new concept involved in the formation of the novel empirical gramians , ( [ eq23 ] ) and ( [ eq24 ] ) , is that of a state - space average of the nonlinear fundamental solution ( [ eq22 ] ) .    the method is successful if the state - space average of the nonlinear fundamental solution is well defined .",
    "of course , this is not the case for all nonlinear systems as the solution of ( [ eq20 ] ) may not exist or may only exist for specific choices of the initial data .",
    "however , the method is applicable for systems for which the nonlinearities are not too severe , e.g. for the so - called weakly nonlinear systems as described in @xcite . for such systems",
    ", it is expected that the nonlinear fundamental solution is close to the exponential form that corresponds to the fundamental solution for a linear system .",
