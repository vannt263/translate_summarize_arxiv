    "a decade ago , as a demonstration of the use of computer algebra @xcite , it was shown that few of the alleged exact static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions of einstein s equations were in fact correct and even fewer made physical sense @xcite . since",
    "then this field of study has been reinvigorated with the development of several solution generating techniques which give rise to new exact solutions .",
    "these techniques are based on the pressure isotropy condition , either looked at as a differential equation , following wyman @xcite , or by way of invariance properties , following buchdahl @xcite .",
    "for example , following the work of rahman and visser @xcite , i showed that several of the acceptable solutions given in @xcite follow from a simple algorithm @xcite which in fact generates an infinite number of physically acceptable solutions . since then several works of interest have appeared : @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that such a staid old subject has bounced back to life .    here",
    "i do not add to these generating techniques but rather make use of one of them to do what they are intended to do : generate a new physically interesting exact solution of einstein s equations .",
    "the example provided serves to emphasize the importance of the integration constant that the generating technique introduces .",
    "every spacetime @xmath0 with metric @xcite @xmath1 where @xmath2 , is an exact perfect fluid solution of einstein s equations as long as @xmath3 and @xmath4 where @xmath5 @xmath6 and the @xmath7 are constants .",
    "the functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 are given by @xmath10    @xmath11    and @xmath12 the algorithm can be executed subject to the specification of the function @xmath13 ( as well as smoothness and boundary conditions @xcite ) and the constants @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "the procedure i consider here will assume @xmath14 and so @xmath15 is disposable ( it can be absorbed into the scale of @xmath16 ) . call these spacetimes @xmath17 .",
    "further , i will write the spacetimes in the form @xmath18 where @xmath19 , as with @xmath20 in @xmath0 , is constructed so as to make @xmath21 a perfect fluid .",
    "that is , for @xmath19 , ( [ a ] ) is replaced by @xmath22 and ( [ b ] ) by @xmath23 in ( [ mass ] ) . unlike @xmath20 however , @xmath19 is no longer the effective gravitational mass @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that @xmath21 is not a conformal transformation of @xmath17 ( due to the restrictions on @xmath19 ) and it is no more general than @xmath17 as it is merely a coordinate transformation of @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "we refer to the case @xmath24 as the  seed \" of the spacetimes @xmath21 .",
    "the usefulness of the form ( [ newform ] ) derives from the fact that we can clearly recognize the seed .",
    "the simplest seed for @xmath21 is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a constant which , by choice of scale for @xmath16 , we can set to zero .",
    "it follows that @xmath28 and the seed is simply the einstein static universe .",
    "( a cosmological constant @xmath29 can be introduced to give zero pressure , but this is not done here @xcite ) . given this seed ,",
    "the regularity conditions on @xmath30 are @xcite @xmath31 and so the simplest non - trivial form of @xmath30 satisfying these conditions is @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 are constants @xcite . since the constant @xmath33 simply scales the energy density and pressure by @xmath35 , without loss in physical generality we set @xmath36 .",
    "since @xmath37 can be absorbed into a redefinition of @xmath38 ( and a rescaling of the as yet to be chosen constant @xmath39 ) we set @xmath40 so that without any loss in physical generality we take @xmath41 .",
    "we now have @xmath42 where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the error function . whereas we could of course continue our discussion in terms of the coordinates used in ( [ newform ] )",
    ", we now revert to more traditional coordinates .    under the coordinate transformation @xmath45",
    "we now have @xmath46 where @xmath47 with @xmath48 @xmath49 and @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the lambert w function @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gradients ] , the constant @xmath39 plays the central role regarding the physical acceptability of these solutions . for @xmath52 @xmath53 vanishes while @xmath54 which is physically unacceptable . for @xmath55",
    "the solution is global , not isolated , and @xmath53 and @xmath56 @xmath57 only as @xmath58 .",
    "finally , for @xmath59 the pressure @xmath56 vanishes at finite @xmath60 and the solutions match onto a vacuum exterior by way of continuity of the effective gravitational mass .",
    "the density contrast at the boundary increases as @xmath39 increases .    throughout the physically acceptable distributions",
    "@xmath53 and @xmath56 are monotone decreasing and the adiabatic sound speed @xmath61 is subluminal .",
    "some properties are shown in fig .",
    "[ properties ] .",
    "we record here in explicit form the essential physical elements of the solutions : the effective gravitational mass is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 given by ( [ f ] ) , the energy density is given by @xmath64 where @xmath65 and @xmath66 and the isotropic pressure is given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 finally , the square of the adiabatic sound speed is given by @xmath70 where @xmath71    @xmath72    @xmath73    and @xmath74",
    "the einstein static universe has been transformed into a class of physically acceptable static fluid spheres whose physical properties have been written out in explicit form .",
    "the technique is but a coordinate transformation of one discussed previously @xcite but it allows a clear understanding how various spacetimes can be interrelated @xcite .",

    ". a partial list of corrections can be found at ` http://grtensor.phy.queensu.ca/solutions/ ` the conditions used in @xcite were : ( i ) isotropy of the pressure ( otherwise any metric is a  solution \" ) , ( ii ) regularity of associated invariants at the origin , ( iii ) positivity of the pressure and energy density , ( iv ) vanishing of the pressure at a finite boundary , ( v ) monotone decrease of the pressure and energy density to the boundary and ( vi ) subluminal adiabatic sound speed .",
    "in addition to these , a monotone decrease in the subluminal adiabatic sound speed was considered desirable .",
