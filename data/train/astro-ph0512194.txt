    "high - resolution observations of the nuclei of many galaxies have revealed large dark masses in small regions .",
    "these are most naturally interpreted as supermassive black holes , but as emphasized by maoz ( 1998 ) it is important to take stock of how rigorously we can rule out other possibilities .    here we present arguments showing that under extremely general conditions almost all other options are ruled out , further emphasizing that supermassive black holes are by far the least exotic and most reasonable explanations for the data in many specific sources . in ",
    "2 we lay out our assumptions , making them as conservative as possible so that our conclusions are robust . in ",
    "3 we show that for many observed galactic nuclei , binaries are unable to heat the stellar distribution effectively because if they are hard then they merge quickly via gravitational radiation .",
    "this important constraint , which depends only on dynamics and not the detailed properties of the specific objects , was not presented by maoz ( 1998 ) or elsewhere as far as we are aware . in ",
    "4 we explore the consequences of core collapse and demonstrate that a very significant mass will inevitably coalesce even for point masses . in   5 we investigate for the first time the consequences if stellar - mass black holes exist outside the nucleus .",
    "we show that enough of them will find their way to the center that they will have serious effects on the nuclear region , likely consuming a significant amount of mass and leading to a supermassive black hole .",
    "we discuss the consequences of this analysis in   6 .",
    "in the spirit of maoz ( 1998 ) , we make a series of conservative assumptions to rule out alternatives to supermassive black holes .",
    "let us suppose that observations have revealed that a mass @xmath0 is confined within a spherically symmetric region whose radius is at most @xmath1 .",
    "we also assume that this mass is composed of identical point masses @xmath2 ; the point mass assumption minimises the interaction between the masses , and making them identical increases as much as possible the relaxation time , on which the masses concentrate in the center of the distribution and hence increase interaction rates .",
    "the local two - body relaxation time for a mass @xmath2 in a region of mass density @xmath3 and velocity dispersion @xmath4 is @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the coulomb logarithm . in general",
    "this time depends on radius , but note that if @xmath7 and the velocity dispersion is dominated by a single large mass , the relaxation time is constant with radius .",
    "any streaming motion ( e.g. , rotation ) reduces the relative speed @xmath4 and hence reduces the relaxation time ( see , e.g. , @xcite for a numerical treatment of a rotating stellar system ) .",
    "therefore , completely random motion leads to the largest timescales .",
    "for @xmath8 identical masses in a region whose crossing time is @xmath9 , the global relaxation time is approximately @xcite @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "both expressions for the relaxation time show that for fixed mass density , lower - mass objects take longer to alter their distribution , as is expected because two - body relaxation occurs due to graininess of the gravitational potential , which is less when there are more objects .",
    "the more concentrated the initial density distribution is , the shorter will be the central relaxation time ( see the extensive discussion in @xcite ) . to be conservative",
    ", we therefore assume a relatively flat distribution such as a plummer sphere , in which @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the core radius .",
    "even for such a distribution , identical point masses will undergo core collapse within a time ( see discussion in @xcite ) @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the relaxation time at the half - mass radius .",
    "note that this is a factor @xmath16 times less than the time needed for the cluster to evaporate ( @xcite ) .",
    "core collapse of single objects will formally lead to infinite density at the center . in globular clusters and similar systems ,",
    "this is avoided by the intervention of binaries : three - body and four - body scattering can transfer energy from binaries to the stellar velocity dispersion , heating the cluster and stabilising the density at the center ( see @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite for cluster simulations involving primordial binaries ) . as we now show , however , when the velocity dispersion is high enough ( as it is in many observed galactic nuclei ) , binaries can not prevent core collapse .",
    "as shown first by @xcite , binary - single interactions tend to harden hard binaries , and soften soft binaries . only hardening will inject energy into the cluster and slow core collapse , hence we only need to consider hard binaries . for equal - mass objects",
    "the hard / soft boundary is approximately where the orbital energy per object is equal to the kinetic energy of field stars @xcite .",
    "suppose that the stellar velocity dispersion is @xmath17 at the resolution radius @xmath18 for a particular galactic nucleus .",
    "then at the hard / soft boundary the semimajor axis @xmath19 is given by @xmath20 any binary emits gravitational radiation as it orbits .",
    "if the time for the binary to merge by gravitational wave emission is less than the time for the binary to interact with field stars , then the binary does not heat the cluster . for a fixed semimajor axis ,",
    "the merger time is maximised for a circular orbit , so we assume @xmath21 to be conservative . for comparison , if @xmath22 ( the mean for a thermal distribution ) , the merger time is decreased by a factor @xmath23 for fixed @xmath19 .",
    "the rate of change in the semimajor axis from gravitational radiation , and corresponding merger time for a circular orbit , is then @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the total mass of the binary , @xmath26 is the reduced mass , in the second line we assume @xmath27 , and in the third line we substitute @xmath28 .",
    "the timescale for a three - body interaction is @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the number density , @xmath31 is the relative speed , and @xmath32 $ ] is the interaction cross section , where @xmath33 is the distance of closest approach . for @xmath34 and three equal masses ,",
    "a binary at the hard / soft boundary has @xmath35 . substituting @xmath36 we find @xmath37 the ratio between the merger and three - body timescales is then @xmath38 this ratio needs to exceed unity for the typical binary to interact before it merges . using the average density @xmath39 and assuming a roughly constant velocity dispersion @xmath40",
    ", we find after some manipulation that @xmath41 implies @xmath42 where @xmath43 .",
    "a cluster made of any point masses lighter than this can not support itself by binary heating .",
    "a loophole might appear to be that when there is bulk rotation ( and hence a reduced velocity dispersion ) or a density profile in which the relative speed at the center is much less than @xmath44 , binaries wide enough not to merge quickly could still heat the distribution .",
    "however , suppose that a binary has tightened by interactions to the point that @xmath28 , as considered above .",
    "its specific binding energy is then @xmath45 , because @xmath40 and thus @xmath46 . even if the cluster is 100% binaries , the total binding energy liberated by hardening is therefore @xmath47 .",
    "the minimum binding energy of a cluster with mass @xmath0 and outer radius @xmath1 is obtained when all the mass is in a thin spherical shell at radius @xmath1 , in which case the binding energy is @xmath48 . even in this case",
    ", therefore , the maximum effect of binares ( prior to their reaching the previously considered semimajor axis @xmath28 ) is to increase the cluster binding energy , and hence the cluster radius , by 50% .",
    "a smaller binary fraction , a more concentrated cluster , or nonzero eccentricities for the binaries will all reduce this number . therefore , if binaries that are hard relative to @xmath17 merge quickly by gravitational radiation , no possible configuration of velocities or densities can allow binaries to stall collapse significantly .",
    "km  s@xmath49 .",
    "the curved lines are labeled by the minimum mass of identical point masses such that if they make up the dark mass , binaries can in principle heat the system and delay core collapse .",
    "several galaxies have @xmath50 ( the galaxy has @xmath51 ) and hence no reasonable stellar component could heat the system . , width=302 ]    figure  [ binary ] plots the black hole mass versus the stellar velocity at the resolution radius , along with the minimum mass of point masses that would allow binary heating .",
    "several galactic nuclei can not be heated by masses lower than @xmath52 , including the galaxy , m87 , m31 , and ngc  4258 .",
    "if such masses were assembled , the number of objects would therefore be small for a given dark mass , which would reduce the relaxation time dramatically ( see equation  [ relax ] ) and would mean that the evaporation time @xmath53 would be much less than a hubble time .",
    "therefore , even with an implausible collection of @xmath54 objects in binaries , the cluster would still disintegrate rapidly .",
    "if core collapse happens , what is the result ?",
    "@xcite found that the density profile approaches @xmath55 .",
    "for ease of calculation , and to be conservative , we will assume a shallower profile @xmath56 , which is appropriate for a singular isothermal sphere .",
    "in such a profile , the total mass interior to radius @xmath57 is proportional to @xmath57 , and the velocity dispersion is constant with radius .    in the high density central regions ,",
    "even point masses can merge because they emit gravitational radiation .",
    "@xcite showed that for a relative speed @xmath58 at infinity between two masses with reduced mass @xmath59 and total mass @xmath60 , there will be a mutual capture if the pericenter distance of approach @xmath33 satisfies @xmath61 for equal masses and @xmath62 , the cross section for merging in the gravitationally focused limit is @xmath63 over a time @xmath64 , the probability of merger of an average point mass is then @xmath65 .",
    "the average number density is @xmath66 . at this density ,",
    "we find after some algebra that the probability is @xmath67 with the rough approximation that @xmath68 and @xmath69 , this implies that the enclosed mass @xmath70 inside of which the masses merge in time @xmath71  gyr is @xmath72 or just @xmath0 if @xmath73 .",
    "the net result is that even for low - mass objects , core collapse will lead to the formation of a large single mass at the center of the distribution .",
    "however , as is clear from equation  ( [ relax ] ) , if the component masses are small enough then the relaxation time is so large that core collapse will not occur .",
    "we now address this situation .",
    "suppose that the particles comprising the matter are very low - mass indeed , such as elementary particles .",
    "suppose also that , like hypothesised dark matter , the particles interact neither with themselves nor with ordinary baryonic matter in any way but gravitationally .",
    "if in some improbable circumstance the particles have collected in a cluster of total mass @xmath0 and radius @xmath1 , what will affect them ?    because the particles have low mass , any more massive objects that enter their region will sink to the center via dynamical friction .",
    "the characteristic time for a mass @xmath2 to sink is ( see @xcite for a discussion ) @xmath74\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the speed of the massive object , @xmath76 is a coulomb logarithm , and @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "if @xmath79 , then @xmath80 . adopting as before @xmath81 we find @xmath82 this implies that for systems such as the central region of m31 , where @xmath83  km  s@xmath49 and @xmath84 @xcite , even ordinary stars will sink to the center of the mass distribution within a few gyr , or much less if the dark matter is more concentrated .",
    "therefore , all ordinary stellar processes that would proceed around a supermassive black hole will also proceed around a concentrated region of noninteracting particles , except that stars inside the region will sink to the center rapidly ( see @xcite ) .",
    "thus if the dynamical friction time at the average density @xmath85 is less than a few gyr , stars and compact objects that enter the region will collide , merge , and have prime conditions for forming a large single mass .",
    "the rate of interactions of stars with the central concentrated region is less for smaller regions .",
    "suppose that the non - stellar matter is very concentrated , say with a radius just a few times the radius of a black hole with the same mass .",
    "then , the arguments used to estimate rates of extreme mass ratio inspirals also apply here .",
    "these arguments suggest that stellar - mass black holes will spiral into supermassive black holes at a rate not less than @xmath86  yr@xmath49 @xcite .",
    "therefore , regardless of how compactly the dark matter is distributed , if stellar - mass black holes exist they will enter the mass distribution in much less than a hubble time .",
    "the mass accreted by a black hole during inspiral is comparatively small .",
    "for example , consider a constant - density region @xmath87 with nonrelativistic particles moving at an average speed @xmath88 relative to the black hole .",
    "the cross section for absorption by a black hole of mass @xmath2 is @xmath89 , so during a time @xmath90 the black hole will accrete a mass @xmath91 this is therefore only a small fraction of the original mass . similarly ,",
    "if after inspiral the black hole is fixed at the center of the mass distribution , it accretes little mass .",
    "this conclusion changes if the black hole wanders freely around the dark matter distribution .",
    "this could happen if , for example , multiple massive objects enter the dark matter region and scatter each other frequently . in this case , for the same assumptions as before , the mass accretion rate @xmath92 becomes @xmath93 implying a growth time @xmath94 this is not constraining on most supermassive black hole candidates , but for the galaxy ( @xmath95 ; @xcite ) and @xmath96  km  s@xmath49 within 45  au @xcite , the growth time is @xmath97  yr .",
    "radio observations @xcite suggest that at least @xmath98 is contained within @xmath99  au of the position of sgr  a@xmath100 , which lowers the accretion time to at most @xmath101  yr . note that a doubling of mass decreases the time to the next doubling by a factor of two , so substantial growth results in a runaway .",
    "note also that because by assumption the only matter entering the black hole does so with prompt infall and without release of radiation , the growth is not limited by the eddington rate .",
    "if the particles are baryonic or otherwise have a reasonable strength of self - interaction , then the accretion rate is greatly enhanced , up to a possible eddington - like maximum .",
    "finally , suppose that the non - luminous matter is in fact in the form of a star supported by pressure gradients rather than by simple motion as we have assumed up to this point .",
    "an example would be fermion balls ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , which are collections of massive neutrinos supported by degeneracy pressure",
    ". in that case , clearly a stellar - mass black hole captured by the star will consume matter at the star s center and remove pressure support , leading to rapid destruction of the star .",
    "in the past decade , thanks to many observational developments , the case for supermassive black holes in the centers of many galaxies has gone from strong to essentially inescapable .",
    "we have shown that for many specific galactic nuclei , the observational constraints are strong enough to rule out binary heating , hence the relevant evolution time is the time to core collapse .",
    "this is a factor of @xmath16 less than the time to evaporation , which has previously been used as the conservative standard for stellar cluster persistence . for many individual galactic nuclei , therefore , the combination of time to core collapse and lack of binary heating rules out dense stellar clusters as an alternate explanation for the inferred dark mass .",
    "specifically , the galaxy , ngc  4208 , and m31 have core collapse times @xmath1022  gyr for @xmath103 objects and can not be stabilised by binaries less than @xmath52 .",
    "m32 also has a core collapse time @xmath1022  gyr , but could in principle be stabilised by stellar - mass binaries .",
    "all other sources currently have core collapse times @xmath104200  gyr for @xmath103 objects .",
    "the only remaining possibilities are concentrated regions of noninteracting low - mass particles or self - supported exotic objects such as a fermion balls @xcite . even in this case",
    ", we have shown that dynamical evolution of the stars and black holes near the centers of galaxies will cause multiple stellar - mass black holes to fall to the center of the potential , if black holes exist at all .",
    "such black holes would consume any high - mass exotic pressure - supported objects , and would also accrete a noninteracting cluster of particles if allowed to move around freely .",
    "therefore , the existence of stellar - mass black holes would lead to the production of supermassive black holes in many specific sources even if the supermassive holes did not form in other ways . when combined with the high redshifts inferred from fe  k@xmath105 lines in some seyfert galaxies @xcite",
    ", dramatic deviations from standard physics are required to explain observations in ways not involving black holes .",
    "we thank laura ferrarese , marc freitag , and doug richstone for valuable discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa atp grant nag 5 - 13229 , and by a senior nrc fellowship during a sabbatical at goddard space flight center ."
