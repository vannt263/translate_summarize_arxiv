    "for power expanding feynman integrals several methods exist , where all of them have their limitations .",
    "mellin - barnes techniques provides a very general method to obtain all powers @xcite .",
    "this method however fails if the integrals are getting too complex . on the other hand _",
    "method of regions _",
    "@xcite is a convenient way to obtain the leading power , whereas it is getting rather complicated for higher powers because of the many contributing regions and because it is difficult to automatize .",
    "furthermore it is a very non - trivial task to make sure that one has not forgotten or counted twice any region .",
    "however in the euclidean limit , where no collinear divergences arise , automatizations exist , which rely on graph theory @xcite . another way to expand feynman integrals , which has been proposed and worked out in @xcite ,",
    "is based on differential equations .",
    "differential equation techniques , which has been proposed first in @xcite , is easy to automatize in a computer algebra system .",
    "this makes it a convenient method to obtain subleading powers , whereas the leading power is in most cases needed as an input like a boundary condition .",
    "another limitation is the fact that this method relies on a correct ansatz in terms of powers of the expansion parameter .",
    "however it is a priori not obvious which powers of the expansion parameter occur ( e.g.  only integer powers or also half - integer powers ) .    in the present paper",
    "i present a semi - numerical method , that provides the power expansion of feynman integrals by giving explicit expressions of the expansion coefficients in form of finite integrals the can be solved numerically . in particular",
    "this method gives the contributing powers of the expansion parameter , from where one can read off the correct ansatz to solve the differential equations that determine the set of feynman integrals .",
    "the algorithm that is worked out in the present paper combines sector decomposition @xcite with mellin - barnes techniques .",
    "it is completely independent from any power counting argument such that it can be used as a cross check for method of regions .",
    "this is very useful in cases , where method of regions becomes involved because of many contributing regions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s1 ]",
    "the algorithm is explained in detail . in section [ s2 ]",
    "i apply this algorithm to a set of two feynman integrals , that are power expanded by differential equation techniques , where the leading powers are obtained by method of regions .",
    "i will show explicitly how this algorithms gives the correct ansatz for the differential equations and provides a non - trivial check for method of regions .",
    "we follow the steps of section 2 of @xcite . we start with a @xmath0-loop feynman integral @xmath1 which using the feynman parameterization @xmath2 can be cast into the form : @xmath3^{-n}. \\label{1.1}\\ ] ] we define @xmath4 as usual . after performing the integration over the loop momenta",
    "we obtain : @xmath5 where @xmath6 \\label{1.3}\\ ] ] and @xmath7 let us assume ( [ 1.3 ] ) contains the parameter @xmath8 , in which we want to expand ( [ 1.1 ] ) . using the mellin - barnes representation @xcite @xmath9 where the integration contour over @xmath10 has to be chosen such that @xmath11 we modify ( [ 1.2 ] ) in the following way @xmath12 where",
    "@xmath13 the main idea behind the procedure below is the following : by closing the integration path to the right hand side of the imaginary axis we sum up all the residua on the positive real axis and obtain an expansion in @xmath8 .",
    "powers of @xmath14 appear because of poles of order higher than one and because of terms of the form @xmath15 in the expansion in @xmath8 .",
    "these terms turn after expanding in @xmath16 into powers of @xmath14 .",
    "we continue with part i and ii of @xcite .",
    "first we split the integral over the feynman parameters into @xmath17 and integrate out the @xmath18-function by the substitution @xmath19 such that we obtain @xmath20 where @xmath21 is obtained by the substitution ( [ 1.4.1 ] ) . in ( [ 1.5 ] ) the integration over small @xmath22 leads to poles in @xmath10 .",
    "this behavior is made explicit , if we follow the steps of part ii of @xcite : look for a minimal set @xmath23 such that @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 vanish , if these parameters are set to zero .",
    "we decompose the integral into @xmath27 subsectors @xmath28 and substitute @xmath29 which leads to the jacobian factor @xmath30 .",
    "now we are able to factorize out @xmath31 from @xmath24 , @xmath25 or @xmath26 . after repeating these steps , until @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 contain terms that are constant in @xmath32 , we end up with integrals over the feynman parameters of the form @xmath33 where @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 contain terms that are constant in @xmath32 . the procedure above can in principal lead to infinite loops .",
    "this problem was addressed in @xcite , where algorithms are proposed that avoid these endless loops by choosing appropriate subsectors .",
    "i have not yet faced any endless loop in the problems i dealt with .",
    "however one should keep in mind that they can occur and adapt the implementation of the algorithm if needed .    from ( [",
    "1.6 ] ) we can read off that the poles in @xmath10 are located at : @xmath37 where @xmath38 .",
    "( [ 1.7 ] ) becomes clear if one taylor expands in ( [ 1.6 ] ) the terms outside the brackets with respect to @xmath39 and performs the integration .    in ( [ 1.5 ] )",
    "we have to choose the contour of the integration over @xmath10 such that the integration over the feynman parameters @xmath39 converges .",
    "this leads to the condition @xmath40 the poles in ( [ 1.7 ] ) that have to be taken into account are those that are located on the right hand side of the integration contour , i.e. @xmath41 from ( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.7.1 ] ) we conclude that ( [ 1.7.2 ] ) is fulfilled if and only if @xmath42 .",
    "in the next step we calculate the residue of ( [ 1.6 ] ) at @xmath43 .",
    "we write the @xmath44th feynman integral in the form @xmath45 and note that this term is singular in @xmath46 if and only if @xmath47 so following part iii of @xcite we expand @xmath48 around @xmath49 and obtain @xmath50 with a rest term @xmath51 , such that ( [ 1.8 ] ) becomes @xmath52 where we used that @xmath53 .",
    "we repeat this procedure for all @xmath44 where condition ( [ 1.9 ] ) is fulfilled .",
    "the remaining integrals do not diverge for @xmath54 .",
    "so it is save to expand them around @xmath46 and we can easily calculate the residue at @xmath54 .    what is left is to calculate the laurent expansion in @xmath16 . from the previous procedure we obtain terms of the form",
    "@xmath55 the logarithms @xmath56 arise from taking the residues of terms of the form @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "in ( [ 1.12 ] ) we wrote these logarithms explicitly such that we can expand @xmath59 around @xmath60 .",
    "the poles in @xmath16 in ( [ 1.12 ] ) originate from integrals @xmath61 with @xmath62 . repeating the procedure above we",
    "expand @xmath63 and obtain for ( [ 1.13 ] ) @xmath64 all the remaining integrals over @xmath39 are finite and can in principle be calculated numerically .",
    "finally the original integral @xmath65 in ( [ 1.1 ] ) obtains the form @xmath66 where the @xmath67 contain finite integrals that can be numerically evaluated .",
    "the logarithms @xmath68 arise both due to poles of higher order in the mellin - barnes parameter and to the expansion in @xmath16 from terms of the form @xmath69 . depending on the values of @xmath70 in ( [ 1.7 ] )",
    "the sum over @xmath71 does not only run over integer numbers but also over numbers of the form @xmath72 where @xmath73 is integer .",
    "i stress that even if a numerical evaluation of the integrals @xmath67 is not possible , we can obtain non - trivial statements about the power expansion of @xmath65 from ( [ 1.16 ] ) together with ( [ 1.7 ] ) .",
    "that is to say ( [ 1.7 ] ) gives us information about the possible powers of @xmath8 e.g.  we know if we only get integer powers or also powers of @xmath74 . and",
    "from ( [ 1.16 ] ) we can read off up to which power @xmath14 appears . as we will see in the next section",
    "this information will prove to be useful to obtain the power expansion by means of differential equations .",
    "the idea to get the expansion of feynman integrals by differential equations has been proposed and worked out in @xcite . by the following example",
    "we will see that the algorithm shown in the last section will give us the correct ansatz to solve the given system of differential equations and help us with the calculation of the initial conditions .",
    "we start with the integrals given by fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , where we assume @xmath75 : @xmath76 let us assume that we want to expand these integrals in @xmath77 and need the result up to order @xmath78",
    ". for simplicity let us also set @xmath79 and @xmath80 .",
    "using integration - by - parts identities @xcite , we get the following differential equations for @xmath81 and @xmath82 : @xmath83 with @xmath84 and @xmath85 \\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^d}\\gamma(\\epsilon)^2 \\frac{\\lambda^{1 - 2\\epsilon}-\\lambda^{-\\epsilon}}{4\\lambda(1-\\lambda ) } , \\label{2.4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where ( [ 2.3 ] ) and ( [ 2.4 ] ) are exact in @xmath8 and @xmath16 . by defining @xmath86 ( [ 2.2 ] ) becomes @xmath87 in ( [ 2.5 ] ) we have not yet specified which values the summation index @xmath88 takes and up to which maximum value the finite sum over @xmath44 runs . by implementing the steps of the last section , which led to ( [ 1.7 ] ) , in a computer algebra system we obtain from ( [ 1.7 ] ) that @xmath81 comes with the powers of @xmath8 @xmath89 and @xmath82 with @xmath90 where @xmath91 . from ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) we read off that @xmath88 takes the values @xmath92 . in ( [ 2.6 ] ) integer - valued and half - integer - valued @xmath88 do not mix .",
    "so we would have missed powers of @xmath74 , if we had made the nave ansatz that @xmath93 only come with integer powers of @xmath8 .",
    "now one could argue that @xmath74 is already contained in the sum over @xmath14 .",
    "however in order to solve ( [ 2.6 ] ) we have to assume that there exists @xmath94 such that @xmath95 for all @xmath96 .",
    "a computer algebra analysis of the algorithm in the previous section tells us that in our special case @xmath97 .    solving ( [ 2.6 ] ) up to @xmath98 we note that we need @xmath99 and @xmath100 as initial conditions , which can be obtained by method of regions @xcite . in the case of",
    "@xmath99 we note that only the region participates where both integration momenta are hard : @xmath101 in this region we obtain @xmath102 which is the leading power of @xmath81 . for @xmath100",
    "we need the region where both @xmath44 and @xmath103 are soft , i.e.@xmath104 this region starts participating at @xmath105 : @xmath106 by comparing these results to ( [ 2.7 ] ) and ( [ 2.8 ] ) we note that ( [ 2.9 ] ) and ( [ 2.10 ] ) correspond to definite poles in the mellin - barnes representation i.e.  at @xmath107 and @xmath108 . by ( [ 1.7 ] ) and ( [ 1.11 ] ) we can calculate the coefficients of @xmath109 and @xmath110 in the @xmath8-expansion of @xmath81 and @xmath82 numerically .",
    "this is a non - trivial test that we have not forgotten a contributing region , which is in general a problem of method of regions .",
    "we normalize our integrals by multiplication with @xmath111 and obtain from the solution of ( [ 2.6 ] ) the analytical expansion in @xmath8 and @xmath16 : @xmath112+\\mathcal{o}(\\epsilon^2 ) \\end{split } \\nonumber \\\\ \\begin{split } & i_2 = \\\\ & \\quad\\quad\\frac{1}{(4\\pi)^4}\\bigg [ -\\frac{1}{2\\epsilon^2}+\\frac{-1 + 2\\ln\\lambda}{2\\epsilon } + \\frac{1}{2}+\\frac{\\pi^2}{4}+2\\ln\\lambda-\\frac{1}{2}(\\ln\\lambda)^2 + \\\\ & \\quad\\quad\\quad \\epsilon\\left(\\frac{11}{2}+\\frac{11\\pi^2}{12}+ \\frac{13}{3}\\zeta(3)+\\left(4+\\frac{\\pi^2}{6}\\right)\\ln\\lambda- ( \\ln\\lambda)^2+\\frac{1}{6}(\\ln\\lambda)^3 \\right)+ \\\\ & \\quad\\quad \\lambda^{\\frac{1}{2}}(-4\\epsilon\\pi^2)+ \\\\ & \\quad\\quad \\lambda\\bigg ( -1-\\frac{\\pi^2}{3}+\\ln\\lambda-\\frac{1}{2}(\\ln\\lambda)^2 + \\\\ & \\quad\\quad\\quad \\epsilon\\left(11+\\frac{2\\pi^2}{3}-4\\zeta(3)-3\\ln\\lambda-",

    "by combining sector decomposition with mellin - barnes techniques i developed an algorithm for power expanding feynman integrals , where the coefficients in the expansion are given by finite integrals . even if these integrals can not be evaluated numerically , we can read off , which powers of the expansion parameter contribute and up to which power the logarithms occur .",
