    "the passage to a quotient by an algebraic group action is often an essential step in classical moduli space constructions of algebraic geometry , and it is the task of geometric invariant theory ( git ) to provide such quotients . starting with mumford s approach of constructing quotients for actions of reductive groups on projective varieties via linearized line bundles and their sets of semistable points  @xcite ,",
    "the notion of a `` good quotient '' became a central concept in git , compare  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "recall that a good quotient for an action of a reductive group @xmath0 on a variety @xmath1 is an affine morphism @xmath2 of varieties such that @xmath3 carries the sheaf of invariants @xmath4 as its structure sheaf . in general ,",
    "a @xmath0-variety @xmath1 need not admit a good quotient , but there may be many different invariant open subsets @xmath5 with a good quotient ; we will call them the good @xmath0-sets .    in this paper , we consider @xmath0-varieties @xmath1 with a finitely generated cox ring , e.g. @xmath1 being a product of projective spaces , and ask for good @xmath0-sets @xmath5 , which are maximal with respect to the properties either that the quotient space @xmath6 is quasiprojective or , more generally , that it comes with the a2-property ; the latter means that any two points of @xmath6 admit a common affine neighbourhood , or , equivalently , that @xmath6 admits a closed embedding into some toric variety , see  @xcite . our aim is to provide a constructive approach to such good @xmath0-sets , splitting the explicit computation into two parts : firstly computations of invariant rings in the spirit of classical invariant theory and , secondly , combinatorial computations with convex polyhedral cones .",
    "another feature is that our approach opens an access to the geometry of quotient spaces via the methods developed in  @xcite .",
    "let us present our results more in detail .",
    "a first step is to consider actions of @xmath0 on factorial affine varieties @xmath1 .",
    "the basic data for the construction of good @xmath0-sets of @xmath1 are _ orbit cones_. they live in the rational character space @xmath7 , and for any @xmath8 its orbit cone @xmath9 is the convex cone generated by all @xmath10 admitting a semiinvariant @xmath11 with weight @xmath12 such that @xmath13 holds .",
    "it turns out that there are only finitely many orbit cones and all of them are polyhedral .",
    "based on the concept of orbit cones , we introduce the data describing the good @xmath0-sets of the factorial affine variety @xmath1 .",
    "first , we associate to any character @xmath10 its _ git - cone _ , namely @xmath14",
    "secondly , we say that a collection @xmath15 of orbit cones is _",
    "2-maximal _ , if for any two members their relative interiors overlap and @xmath15 is maximal with respect to this property .",
    "here comes the first result , see theorems  [ thm : gitfan ] and  [ thm : maxcoll ] .",
    "let a connected reductive group @xmath0 act on a factorial affine variety  @xmath1",
    "the git - cones form a fan in @xmath7 , and this fan is in a canonical order reversing bijection with the collection of sets of semistable points of  @xmath1 .",
    "2 .   there is a canonical bijection from the set of 2-maximal collections of orbit cones onto the collection of a2-maximal good @xmath0-sets of @xmath1 .    for the case of a torus @xmath0",
    "this result was known before .",
    "the first statement is given in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , a result similar to the second statement was obtained in  @xcite for linear torus actions on vector spaces , and for torus actions on any affine factorial @xmath1 , statement  ( ii ) is given in  @xcite .    to obtain the general statement , we reduce to the case of a torus action as follows",
    ". consider the quotient @xmath16 by the semisimple part @xmath17 .",
    "it comes with an induced action of the torus @xmath18 , and the key observation is that the good @xmath19-sets in @xmath3 are in a canonical bijection with the good @xmath0-sets in @xmath1 , see proposition  [ thm : reduct ] .",
    "note that this is the place , where in explicit computations , classical invariant theory comes in , as it provides often the necessary information on the algebra @xmath20^{g^s}$ ] of invariants , see the examples discussed in sections  [ sec : amplegit ] and  [ sec : quotgeo ] .",
    "the second step is passing to the case of a normal variety @xmath1 with a finitely generated cox ring @xmath21 ; recall that , for its definition , one assumes that the divisor class group @xmath22 is free and finitely generated , and then sets @xmath23 the `` total coordinate space '' @xmath24 of @xmath1 is the spectrum of the cox ring @xmath21 .",
    "this @xmath24 is a factorial affine variety , see  @xcite , acted on by the neron - severi torus @xmath25 having the divisor class group @xmath22 as its character lattice .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 can be reconstructed from @xmath24 as a good quotient @xmath26 by @xmath25 for an open subset @xmath27 , see section  [ sec : lift ] for details .    after replacing @xmath0 with a simply connected covering group",
    ", its action on @xmath1 can be lifted to the total coordinate space @xmath24 .",
    "the actions of @xmath25 and @xmath0 on @xmath24 commute , and thus define an action of the direct product @xmath28 .",
    "given a good @xmath29-set @xmath30 , we introduce in  [ def : satint ] a `` saturated intersection '' @xmath31 .",
    "the main feature of this construction is the following , see theorem  [ thm : sqcap ] .",
    "the canonical assignment @xmath32 defines a surjection from the collection of good @xmath29-sets in @xmath24 to the collection of good @xmath0-sets in @xmath1 .",
    "so this result reduces the construction of good @xmath0-sets on @xmath1 to the construction of good @xmath29-sets in @xmath24 , and the latter problem , as noted before , is reduced to the case of a torus action . again , this allows explicit computations .",
    "note that our way to reduce the construction of quotients to the case of a torus action has nothing in common with the various approaches based on the hilbert - mumford criterion , see  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but is rather in the spirit of  ( * ? ? ?",
    "3 ) .    as a first application of this result",
    ", we give an explicit description of the ample git - fan , i.e. , the chamber structure of the linearized ample cone , for a given normal projective @xmath0-variety @xmath1 with finitely generated cox ring , see proposition  [ amplegit ] ; recall that existence of the ample git - fan for any normal projective @xmath0-variety was proven in  @xcite  @xcite , and , finally,@xcite . as an example , we compute the ample git - fan for the diagonal action of @xmath33 on a product of projective spaces @xmath34 , see  theorem  [ tsp ] .    as a second application of the above result",
    "we obtain gelfand - macpherson type correspondences .",
    "classically  @xcite , this correspondence relates orbits of the diagonal action of the special linear group @xmath0 on a product of projective spaces to the orbits of an action of a torus @xmath19 on a grassmannian .",
    "kapranov  @xcite extended this correspondence to isomorphisms of certain git - quotients and used it in his study of the moduli space of point configurations on the projective line .",
    "similarly , thaddeus  @xcite proceeded with complete collineations . in section",
    "[ sec : gmcorr ] , we put these correspondences into a general framework , relating git - quotients and also their inverse limits .",
    "as examples , we retrieve a result of  @xcite and also an isomorphism of git - limits in the setting of  @xcite .    finally , we use our approach to study the geometry of quotient spaces of a connected reductive group @xmath0 on a normal variety @xmath1 with finitely generated cox ring .",
    "the basic observation is that in many cases our quotient construction provides the cox ring of the quotient spaces .",
    "this allows to apply the language of bunched rings developed in  @xcite , which encodes information on the geometry of a variety in terms of combinatorial data living in the divisor class group .",
    "in this section , we recall the concept of a good quotient and state basic properties , which will be used freely in the subsequent text .    throughout the whole paper , we work in the category of algebraic varieties over an algebraically closed field @xmath35 of characteristic zero . by a point",
    "we always mean a closed point .",
    "if we say that an algebraic group @xmath0 acts on a variety @xmath1 , then we tacitly assume that this action is given by a morphism @xmath36 , and we refer to @xmath1 as a @xmath0-variety . as usual",
    ", we say that a morphism @xmath37 of @xmath0-varieties is equivariant if it is compatible with the actions in the sense that always @xmath38 holds . moreover , a morphism is called invariant , if it is constant along the orbits .",
    "the classical finiteness theorem in invariant theory says that for an action of a reductive linear algebraic group on an affine variety @xmath39 , the algebra @xmath40 of invariant functions is finitely generated .",
    "this allows to define the classical invariant theory quotient @xmath41 , which comes with a morphism @xmath42 .",
    "the notion of a good quotient is locally modeled on this concept :    let @xmath0 be a reductive linear algebraic group .",
    "a _ good quotient _ for a @xmath0-variety @xmath1 is an affine morphism @xmath42 onto a variety @xmath3 such that the pullback @xmath43 to the sheaf of invariants is an isomorphism .",
    "a good quotient is called _ geometric _ , if its fibers are precisely the orbits .",
    "the basic properties of a good quotient @xmath42 of a @xmath0-variety are that it sends closed @xmath0-invariant subsets @xmath44 to closed sets @xmath45 , and that for any two disjoint closed @xmath0-invariant subsets @xmath46 their images @xmath47 are again disjoint .",
    "an immediate consequence is that each fiber @xmath48 of a good quotient @xmath42 contains precisely one closed @xmath0-orbit , and this orbit lies in the closure of any further orbit in @xmath48 .",
    "these basic properties imply that a good quotient @xmath49 for a @xmath0-variety @xmath1 is categorical , i.e. , any @xmath0-invariant morphism @xmath50 factors uniquely through @xmath49 . in particular , good quotient spaces are unique up to isomorphism .",
    "this justifies the notation @xmath51 for good and @xmath52 for geometric quotients , which we will use frequently in the sequel .",

    "conversely , if the stepwise good quotients exist , then one directly verifies that their composition is a good quotient for the @xmath0-variety @xmath1 .    in general , quite a few non - affine @xmath0-varieties",
    "@xmath1 admit a good quotient @xmath51",
    ". however , there may be many open invariant subsets @xmath60 with a good quotient @xmath61 , and it is one of the main tasks of the theory of good quotients to describe all these sets . here",

    "we conclude this section with recalling the construction of good @xmath0-sets with quasiprojective quotient spaces as sets of semistable points presented by d.  mumford in  @xcite .",

    "then the cone @xmath641 is given by the additional inequalities @xmath642 in particular , the point @xmath643 is contained in @xmath644 for @xmath625 .",
    "moreover , this point belongs to the walls @xmath645 with @xmath646 .",
    "taking @xmath647 , one gets that the git - cone @xmath141 is one - dimensional .",

    "then we have an induced @xmath0-action on @xmath689 by construction , @xmath690 is the equivariant total coordinate space .",

    "the situation is sketched in the following figure , where the bullets stand for the weights , and the shadowed area indicates the cone @xmath700 .",
