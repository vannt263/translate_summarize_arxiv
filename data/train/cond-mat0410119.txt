    "statistical mechanics deals with systems containing a very large number ( @xmath2 ) of interacting particles .",
    "nowadays , as the experimental investigation of few - atom systems is becoming possible , the analysis of small systems raises fundamental questions  @xcite , and the problem of a statistical description of few - body systems with strong nonlinear interaction is a subject of current research  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately we are still far from understanding what are the conditions for a few - body system to reach , if any , an equilibrium , and how to describe it in the same way as statistical mechanics provides a powerful description of large systems .",
    "for instance , even the existence of temperature at the nanoscale has been recently questioned in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been recently shown that , for a heisenberg model with all - to - all coupling , there exists a specific energy threshold below which total magnetization can not change its sign , even when the number of spins is finite  @xcite .",
    "this ergodicity breaking phenomenon has been related to the existence of a topological non - connectivity threshold ( tnt ) of the energy surface .",
    "this type of ergodicity breaking at finite @xmath0 is different from the @xmath3 ergodicity breaking in a standard ising model below the critical temperature .",
    "the existence of this threshold is not restricted to the infinite range coupling case .",
    "it is also present when the interaction among heisenberg spins decays as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the distance between two spins .",
    "it has been indeed proved  @xcite that , for a @xmath6dimensional system , the ratio of the disconnected portion of the energy range with respect to the total energy range tends to zero in the thermodynamic limit for @xmath7 ( short range interactions ) while it remains finite for @xmath8 ( long range interactions ) . on the other hand , although the mean - field ( all - to - all ) type of spin coupling might appear unphysical , magnetic systems can be realized , using modern experimental techniques @xcite , which are well described by heisenberg  like hamiltonians with an infinite range term .",
    "moreover , when the range of the interaction is of the same order of the size of the system , all - to - all coupling may be a meaningful first order approximation  @xcite .",
    "this could be the case for small systems used in current nano - technology , which requires to deal with systems made of a few dozens of particles .",
    "otherwise , all - to - all coupling is relevant for macroscopic systems with long range interactions , like gravitational and unscreened coulomb systems  @xcite .",
    "we address in this paper the issue of providing a theoretical framework to calculate the magnetization reversal time for the mean - field anisotropic heisenberg model in a magnetic field , in which a finite number @xmath0 of spins interact with all - to - all couplings .",
    "we have already stressed that below the tnt the total magnetization can not reverse its sign , thus magnetization does not relax to its equilibrium value . in this paper",
    "we will answer the following questions : @xmath9 above the tnt , does the magnetization reverse its sign ?",
    "if so , on which time scale ?",
    "@xmath10 what is the relevance of the tnt in a system with a standard magnetic phase transition ?",
    "thus , the aim is to explain the main physical effects associated with the tnt , and how it affects the phase transition appearing in this model at a higher energy .",
    "the latter is studied in the microcanonical ensemble , applying a recently developed solution method of mean - field hamiltonians based on large - deviation theory  @xcite .",
    "we study in detail , numerically and analytically , the time scale for magnetization reversal . at the tnt , the reversal time diverges as a power law , with a characteristic exponent proportional to the number of spins @xmath0 . based on analytical calculations",
    ", we expect this property to be universal . finally , we extend some of the results obtained for all - to - all coupling to other models : chains with distance dependent couplings and small clusters with nearest neighbor interactions .",
    "we show the existence of the tnt also in these cases , and we present strong evidence for the power law divergence of the reversal time .",
    "the hamiltonian of the model is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the spin vector with continuous components , @xmath0 is the number of spins , @xmath13 is the rescaled external magnetic field strength and @xmath14 the all - to - all coupling strength ( the summation is extended over all pairs ) .",
    "let us also define @xmath15 as the components of the total magnetization of the system .",
    "due to the anisotropy of the coupling , the system has an easy  axis of the magnetization along the @xmath16 direction ( the easy  axis of the magnetization is defined by the direction of the magnetization in the minimal energy configuration of the system ) .",
    "the equations of motion are derived in a standard way from hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) , and we obtain :    @xmath17    the total energy @xmath18 and the spin moduli @xmath19 are constants of the motion .",
    "dynamics , already studied in a similar model  @xcite , is characterized by chaotic motion ( positive maximal lyapunov exponent ) for not too small energy values and spin coupling constants . for @xmath20 the model is exactly integrable , while for generic @xmath14 and @xmath13 there is a mixed phase space with prevalently chaotic motion for @xmath21 .",
    "we will now show the existence of two distinct thresholds in this model : first we derive analytically the topological non  connectivity threshold ( tnt ) , then we will present the microcanonical analysis and the analytical evaluation of the statistical threshold , at which a second order phase transition occurs in the @xmath22 limit .",
    "the phase space of the system is topologically disconnected below a given energy density @xmath23 , which can be obtained as in ref .",
    "@xcite . from symmetry considerations , both positive and negative regions of @xmath24 exist on the same energy surface . indeed",
    "the hamiltonian is invariant under a rotation of @xmath25 around the @xmath26 axis for which @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",

    "hence , for all energy values above @xmath30\\ ] ] magnetization reversal is possible , while below this value magnetization can not change sign .",
    "hamiltonian ( [ ham ] ) can be written as follows : @xmath31 the topological non - connectivity threshold ( tnt ) is defined as the minimum of the hamiltonian under the @xmath32 constraints : @xmath33 instead of solving the constrained problem , we simplify it by calculating the absolute minimum of @xmath34.\\ ] ] if the minimal solution satisfies both @xmath35 and @xmath29 , the problem is equivalent to the original one .",

    "integrable regime , panel @xmath101 , the decay of @xmath207 is much slower ( observe the difference in the time axis scale ) . ]",
    "to better understand the origin of this quasi - integrable regime , it is interesting to compare the dynamics obtained from the full hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonien2 ] ) with the dynamics obtained from the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonien3 ] ) .",
    "taking into account the conservation of the total angular momentum @xmath208 , a change of variable maps ( [ hamiltonien3 ] ) onto a 2 degrees of freedom hamiltonian ; the dynamics of the global magnetization is then obviously integrable .",

    "the orbits of the macroscopic variable @xmath211 cover tori , since the mean - field hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonien3 ] ) is exactly integrable .",

    "two trajectories of the full hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonien2 ] ) and the same initial conditions are then considered , labeled by @xmath215 and @xmath216 .",
    "as one can see these orbits stay for a long time sufficiently close to the mean - field orbits . again , while @xmath216 displays a typical `` ferromagnetic '' behavior , @xmath215 is of `` paramagnetic '' nature . both trajectories @xmath215 and @xmath216 have a positive maximal lyapunov and are therefore chaotic . upon increasing @xmath14 , and keeping the same value of @xmath217",
    ", we enter in the regime described by the lower panel in fig .",
    "[ 48jul ] . in this case , as above , we show the orbit @xmath218 of the mean - field hamiltonian ( actually a `` ferromagnetic '' one ) .",
    "the corresponding orbit of the full hamiltonian , @xmath219 , is still characterized by a positive lyapunov exponent and covers both branches , @xmath138 and @xmath214 , thus inducing the demagnetization of the system .",
    "what is important to stress is that in this case the trajectories of the full hamiltonian cover both the positive and the negative magnetization branch on the same energy surface .",
    "having in mind the mechanism that produces the transition to _ global stochasticity _ in low - dimensional hamiltonian systems  @xcite , we can conjecture that invariant curves , confining the motion , exist in the case of fig .",
    "[ 48jul]a .",
    "the breakdown of these invariant curves signals the transition to a globally chaotic motion . of course",
    ", characterizing such a breakdown is an hard task , due to the high - dimensionality of the phase - space .    the determination of parameter regions in which the system is quasi ",
    "integrable or fully chaotic is still an open question .",
    "we can only make a few qualitative considerations .",
    "let us consider hamiltonian ( [ hamiltonien2 ] ) ; it contains the sum of two terms : a mean - field integrable term plus the term @xmath220 , which is responsible for the chaoticity of the system .",
    "the minimal specific energy of this term is @xmath221 .",
    "we can thus suppose that for @xmath222 the quasi ",
    "integrable regime prevails , while for @xmath223 a fully chaotic regime sets in .",

    "this is always the case if @xmath225 since for these values of @xmath14 , @xmath226 . on the contrary ,",
    "for @xmath227 we expect a quasi  integrable regime between @xmath23 and @xmath228 , which should persist in the thermodynamic limit .     over the @xmath209 plane for both the mean - field hamiltonian",
