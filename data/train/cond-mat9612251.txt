    "in recent years , one - dimensional ( 1d ) semiconductor nanostructures have received increasing attention .",
    "the potential technological application of quantum wires ( qwrs ) , e.g. in laser devices , has fueled a search for new fabrication techniques and improved sample quality .",
    "@xcite in this area , recent investigations have focused on two classes of structures , the so - called v - shaped  @xcite and t - shaped  @xcite qwrs ( v - qwrs and t - qwrs ) . due to high control on growth conditions and strong confinement of the electron and hole wavefunctions on the scale of few nanometers , v - qwrs and t - qwrs share desirable optical properties for device applications , such as large exciton binding energy and small linewidth .",
    "v - qwrs are obtained from a gaas substrate grown along the [ 001 ] crystallographic direction , patterned with [ @xmath010]-oriented v - shaped grooves obtained by chemical etching .",
    "the active region consists of a gaas layer cladded between two al@xmath1ga@xmath2as   regions  @xcite or gaas / alas superlattices  @xcite ( sls ) overgrown on the patterned substrate . the confining potential ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geom ] ) has a crescent shape profile .",
    "t - qwrs are obtained by first growing a gaas / al@xmath1ga@xmath2as   sl on a ( 001 ) substrate . after cleavage , a gaas quantum well ( qw ) is grown over the exposed ( 110 ) surface , resulting in a t - shaped active region .",
    "@xcite in both cases , the electron and hole wavefunctions are confined in the [ 001 ] and [ 110 ] crystallographic directions , while the qwr free axis is parallel to the [ @xmath010 ] direction .",
    "the optical spectroscopy of qwrs is more complex than for qws of similar lateral dimension , since in qwrs linewidths can be comparable to intersubband splittings .",
    "on the other hand , a remarkable peculiarity of qwrs with respect to qws is that the optical activity is strongly anisotropic when light is linearly polarized , with the electric field directed parallel or perpendicular to the wire axis .",
    "this has long been recognized to be a band structure effect due to the quasi-1d character of electronic state , combined with heavy- and light - hole ( hh and lh ) mixing .",
    "@xcite the anisotropic absorption is therefore used as a simple tool to reveal the 1d character of electronic states in nanostructured materials .    in principle",
    ", the optical anisotropy can be exploited to single out detailed information on the electronic states , since , as we will show , it is very sensitive to specific details of the band structure . in practice , this approach has been sofar limited by the lack of realistic calculations for complex geometries , as the present v - qwrs and t - qwrs . indeed , common theoretical methods , even within semi - empirical schemes as the tight - binding or the envelope function approach , require a large scale computational effort . in order to keep calculations tractable , up to now the optical properties of qwrs",
    "have been investigated theoretically only for rather idealized structures  @xcite , yielding results that can not be directly compared with experimental spectra .",
    "calculations have been performed for realistic qwr geometries  @xcite , but they have sofar neglected hh - lh mixing .",
    "recently , we have demonstrated , by a combined theoretical - experimental study of v - qwrs ,  @xcite that accurate band structure calculations for realistic structures provide quantitative predictions of photoluminescence excitation ( ple ) spectra , and that detailed information on the valence band states can be singled out of the ple anisotropy , despite the dominant role of the light conduction electrons in the optical spectra .",
    "such calculations were based on a recently devised method which provides the band structure for qwrs of arbitrary geometry at a relatively small computational cost . the accuracy and",
    "the short computer times make such calculations a practical characterization tool in conjunction with experimental results , as well as a predictive tool for new devices .    in this paper",
    ", we present a theoretical investigation of the electronic and optical properties of v - qwrs and t - qwrs .",
    "we focus on the relationship between optical anisotropy and band structure , and we show how the analysis of optical anisotropy permits a detailed spectroscopy of valence states , even when the large linewidth of the spectra does not allow an identification of the valence - to - conduction subband transitions . for t - qwrs",
    "we also predict a huge spin - splitting of the lowest valence subband , originating from the interaction between the lowest hh levels of the intersecting qws . for both classes of wires ,",
    "calculations are performed by the numerical method introduced in ref .",
    "here described in detail , thereby demonstrating its accuracy and flexibility .",
    "the main approximation that is still present in our approach is the neglect of excitonic effects .",
    "indeed , recent calculations which fully include coulomb interaction in realistic qwr profiles  @xcite ( but do not include hh - lh mixing ) demonstrate that electron - hole interaction , besides giving rise to bound excitonic states below the band edge , also modifies the excitonic continuum above the band edge .",
    "however , our previous investigation in v - qwrs  @xcite has shown that quantitative agreement is obtained between the observed ple anisotropy , which probe the excitonic continuum , and the anisotropy in absorption spectra calculated neglecting excitonic effects .",
    "we interpret this result as an indication that the electron - hole coulomb interaction , by mixing isotropically the ( optically anisotropic ) electron and hole states , does not change the average anisotropy as obtained by single particle band structure calculations .",
    "this is of course compatible with the possibility that the relative intensity of the absorption peaks for a given polarization may be strongly affected .",
    "@xcite the above arguments suggest that the approximation of neglecting electron - hole coulomb coupling is a reasonable one for our purpose of studying optical anisotropies . of course , its accuracy for the present v- and t - qwrs must be established a posteriori by comparison with experiments , as we will do later on in this paper .",
    "the theoretical background and the numerical method used in our calculations are outlined in sec .",
    "[ sec : metodo ] .",
    "sections [ sec : v ] and [ sec : t ] report the results of our calculations , focusing on the band structure and optical anisotropy , for v - qwrs and t - qwrs , respectively .",
    "in this section we describe the theoretical framework of our calculations . as we are interested in optical transitions near the direct band gap of gaas , and because qwr electronic states are extended over several nanometers , we work within the envelope function approximation .",
    "for the wires of interest in this paper , we choose the following cartesian reference frame ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : geom ] ) : @xmath3 along the [ 110 ] direction , @xmath4 along the [ 001 ] direction , and @xmath5 along the [ @xmath610 ] direction .",
    "therefore , for both classes of wires , the qwr section extends in the @xmath7 plane , while its free axis is parallel to the @xmath5-direction .",
    "due to translational invariance , along this direction it is possible to define a 1d wavevector @xmath8 . in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 directions",
    "we assume a supercell periodicity , i.e. we describe arrays of qwrs .",
    "the size of the supercell can be taken large enough to describe effectively isolated wires when needed .",
    "electron and hole states will be described separately by different effective mass equations . for conduction electrons , we assume a single band approximation , which implies a parabolic energy dispersion in the free direction ; the wavefunctions of the electron subbands are @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the atomic @xmath11 state with spin @xmath12 , @xmath13 is the subband index , and @xmath14 is the @xmath13-th solution of the envelope function equation .",
    "since we deal with a two - dimensional confinement potential @xmath15 , we can factorize @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the @xmath13-th solution of @xmath18 with the electron effective mass hamiltonian @xmath19;\\ ] ] here @xmath20 is the electron effective mass , and @xmath21 , @xmath22 . of course",
    ", in this one - band description , the electron subbands @xmath23 depend quadratically on @xmath8 : @xmath24 where the @xmath25 s are the confinement energies ( i.e. , the subband edges ) .",
    "the subbands @xmath26 are spin - degenerate , and the @xmath17 s are @xmath8-independent .",
    "conduction band states do not directly contribute to optical anisotropy , being mainly of isotropic @xmath11-type character , and in this case the above one - band description is sufficient .",
    "conversely , it is essential to give accurate account of @xmath27-type valence states by a multi - band description , in order to investigate optical anisotropy . due to mixing between hh and lh subbands , both eigenvalues and envelope functions",
    "depend non - trivially on the wavevector @xmath8 and the hole subband index @xmath28 . using the compact notation @xmath29 , we write the hole wavefunctions @xmath30 where @xmath31 are the four atomic states with total angular momentum @xmath32 and projection @xmath33 of @xmath34 along a quantization axis . again",
    ", each envelope function @xmath35 can be factorized as @xmath36 , and the four - component vector @xmath37 is the @xmath28-th solution at point @xmath8 of the multi - band effective mass equation  @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the luttinger hamiltonian .",
    "@xcite with the above choice of coordinate axes and the quantization axis of @xmath40 along the [ 110 ] direction , following ref .",
    "the luttinger hamiltonian reads @xmath41 where    @xmath42 ,           \\\\",

    "the hole hamiltonian for structures grown along crystallographic directions different from the present ones can be obtained along the lines of ref .  .",
    "in the above electron and hole effective mass hamiltonians we neglect the material dependence of the electron effective mass @xmath20 and the luttinger parameters @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 , and we always use the bulk gaas values listed in table  [ tab : parameters ] . although our approach can be extended to account for the material dependence , this would be a small effect in our calculations .",
    "one possible approach to solve the multi - band equation ( [ eq : multiband ] ) is to split the problem in two parts : the first step is to solve the two schrdinger - like equations arising from the diagonal terms of ( [ eq : h_l ] ) , @xmath46\\phi^1_i(x , y ) = \\epsilon^1_i\\phi^1_i(x , y ) , \\\\",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the second step is to use the set @xmath47 as a basis to expand the components @xmath48 of the vector @xmath49 , and the set @xmath50 as a basis for the components @xmath51 . in this representation ,",
    "the diagonal matrix elements of the @xmath52 are given by the two sets of scalar numbers @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and matrix elements need only to be calculated for off - diagonal terms , using the functions @xmath47 , @xmath50 .",
    "this approach has the following drawback : since the effective masses appearing in @xmath55 , @xmath56 ( the so - called hh and lh effective masses ) are very different , the two sets of eigenvalues @xmath53 , @xmath54 span different energy ranges",
    ". the set @xmath54 , being the spectrum of a light particle , will have larger gaps , and the ground state will be higher in energy than for the set @xmath53 . since we are mainly interested in the low - lying hole subbands near @xmath57 , this representation , although exact in principle , is poorly convergent with respect to the number of states @xmath47 , @xmath50 included in the basis , and it is not practical in numerical calculations .    to solve this problem",
    ", we propose a scheme in which we expand the components of @xmath58 using the solutions of two schrdinger - like equations with two fictitious , arbitrary masses @xmath59 , @xmath60 , which then we tune in order to improve the convergence :    @xmath61 \\phi^+_\\nu ( x , y ) & = & \\epsilon^+_\\nu\\phi^+_\\nu ( x , y ) ,   \\label{eq : fict - f}\\\\ \\left[\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m^-}\\left(\\hat{k}_x^2+\\hat{k}_y^2\\right)+v(x , y)\\right ] \\phi^-_\\mu ( x , y ) & = & \\epsilon^-_\\mu\\phi^-_\\mu ( x , y ) \\label{eq : fict - l}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    ( here and in the following we use the index @xmath62 for @xmath63 states , and @xmath64 for @xmath65 states ) . in this way",
    ", we diagonalize exactly only _ part _ of the kinetic energy terms @xmath55 and @xmath56 of @xmath39 , but the potential @xmath15 is exactly diagonalized . of course ,",
    "in this representation @xmath66 , @xmath67 are _ not _ the diagonal elements of the matrix representing the hamiltonian , and @xmath55 , @xmath56 give rise to additional off - diagonal terms .",
    "however , the time spent to calculate the additional terms is more than compensated by the improved convergence which can be achieved by properly choosing @xmath59 and @xmath60 . in the end",
    ", we shall find it convenient to choose @xmath68 , and equal to the heavy hole effective mass along the [ 001 ] direction .",
    "to implement this idea , we add and subtract a term @xmath69 to @xmath55 , and a term @xmath70 to @xmath56 . then we obtain :    @xmath71    where    @xmath72    then we solve the equations ( [ eq : fict - f])-([eq : fict - l ] ) by a plane - wave expansion , as outlined in ref .  . typically , we fix two energy cutoffs , @xmath73 and @xmath74 , and we find the @xmath75 and @xmath76 eigenstates which fall below the cutoffs .",
    "using the eigenfunctions @xmath77 , @xmath78 , we form the following basis set :    @xmath79    with @xmath80 and @xmath81 , and we expand @xmath49 in this basis : @xmath82 the explicit matrix elements of @xmath39 in this basis are given in appendix [ sec : app - a ] .",
    "the total dimension of the hamiltonian matrix in this representation is @xmath83 .",

    "the choice of @xmath59 , @xmath60 , which is important in order to obtain an efficient convergence , is discussed in detail in appendix [ sec : app - b ] ; here we only anticipate that in all our calculations we use @xmath90 .",
    "once we have calculated the electron and hole subbands by the above method , we are in the position to evaluate the absorption spectrum @xmath91 in the dipole approximation , summing the dipole matrix element , with the appropriate polarization of light @xmath92 , over all electron and hole states : @xmath93 where the optical matrix elements @xmath94 are given in appendix [ sec : app - c ] , and @xmath95 is the bulk energy gap of gaas ; tipically , a set of sixty @xmath8 points have been included in the summation .",
    "the absorption spectra shown in this paper have been obtained by superimposing a gaussian broadening @xmath96 to @xmath91 , in order to simulate the inhomogenous broadening due to structural imperfections of the samples .",
    "the broadened spectrum is obtained as @xmath97",
    "as a prototype of v - qwrs , we first consider a sample described in refs .  .",
    "this consists of an active gaas layer embedded in a ( alas)@xmath98/(gaas)@xmath99 sl , overgrown by molecular beam epitaxy on the exposed surface of the etched substrate . as in refs .",
    ", we use the v - shaped potential profile obtained by digitalizing a tem micrograph of the sample .",
    "we also adopt the same supercell geometry as in refs .  .",
    "the complicated structure of the sl which provides the quasi-1d confinement is modelled by a homogeneous barrier with effective conduction and valence band offsets , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , respectively . based on previous investigations  @xcite for the same sample ,",
    "we take @xmath102 and @xmath103 .",
    "it should be noted that the effort of including exactly the confining sl in the calculations would not necessarily result in improved accuracy , as the envelope function approximation itself looses its validity for such short - period sls .    in order to investigate the role of the confinement in the optical properties",
    ", we shall consider two sample profiles , which differ in the value of the confinement length @xmath104 at the bottom of the v - shaped region ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : geom ] ) : profile a ( @xmath105 ) and profile b ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "these sl - embedded qwrs will be labelled a / sl and b / sl .    a key issue which make nm - scale qwrs interesting for electro - optical applications are large confinement energies which can be obtained with large band - offsets in addition to geometric confinement .",
    "in view of this fact , we shall compare the samples described above with samples having the same profiles and barriers constituted by pure alas , that we will label a / alas and b / alas .",
    "the parameters of the four samples are summarized in table  [ tab : samples ] .",
    "a qualitative interpretation of the band structure of a v - qwr can be obtained by adding to a qw of width @xmath104 an additional lateral confinement due to the crescent shape of the profile . in the lowest approximation , the latter",
    "can be thought of as a parabolic potential  @xcite which splits each subband of the parent qw into a new set of subbands . since the additional confinement is less effective than the confinement due to the original qw , the new sets of subbands have smaller gaps with respect to the subband splittings of the parent qw .",
    "this simplified picture will serve as a guideline for the discussion of numerical results obtained for the actual samples .",
    "the calculated energies at @xmath107 of the lowest conduction and valence states are listed for reference in table [ tab : v - edges ] for the four samples . in the following",
    "we shall focus on hole subbands , which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - bande ] ( right panel ) for sample a / sl .",
    "first , we note that at @xmath107 each subband is doubly degenerate , while at finite @xmath8 the subbands are spin - split , due to the lack of inversion symmetry of the confining potential .  @xcite splittings are in the range of few mev .",
    "secondly , a strongly non - parabolic energy dispersion is evident .",
    "this fact , familiar from qws , is due to mixing of states with hh ( @xmath108 ) character and lh ( @xmath109 ) character .",
    "the hh / lh character of hole states influences the optical properties of the sample , since different atomic orbital components have different oscillator strenghts ; of particular interest from this point of view , are the @xmath107 states which , due to the large density of states ( dos ) stemming from their quasi-1d character , mainly contribute to the absorption intensity .",
    "contrary to the case of qws , hole subbands can not be strictly classified as hh and lh states even at @xmath107 . to define the hh / lh character in the present samples , we note that the direction of strongest confinement is the [ 001 ] direction , as demonstrated by charge density maps of the lowest lying states which we will show later in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - chd ] .",
    "it is therefore meaningful to calculate the hh / lh character along this direction , because this would be the quantization axis of @xmath34 in an equivalent [ 001]-grown qw of width @xmath104 . to do this ,",
    "we calculate the rotated vector @xmath110 , where @xmath111 @xmath112 is obtained by diagonalizing the matrix @xmath113 written in the representation in which @xmath114 is diagonal , with eigenvalues @xmath115 .",
    "then we define the hh- and lh - projected charge densities    @xmath116    finally , the hh and lh character is obtained by integrating the above charge densities over all space .",
    "( in the above equations , the real - space representation is chosen for clarity .",
    "the corresponding expressions in fourier space , which we use in the numerical implementation , are very easy to obtain and are not explicitated here . )    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : v - bande ] we show the calculated lh character of the hole subbands at @xmath117 .",
    "this is best analized in connection with fig .",
    "[ fig : v - chd ] , where we show the total and projected charge densities of the hole states at @xmath107 for the same a / sl sample . in the ground state ,",
    "the lh component is rather small ( @xmath118 ) , but it increases rapidly for the excited subbands .",
    "correspondingly , the ground state is well localized [ fig .",
    "[ fig : v - chd](a ) ] , while the lowest excited states [ figs .  [ fig : v - chd](b ) , [ fig : v - chd](c ) ] have wavefunctions which increasingly extend along the v - qwr sidewalls . the regular increase of the lh component is interrupted by the @xmath119 levels ( 13th doublet : recall that each point at @xmath107 is doubly degenerate ) at @xmath120 which is mainly of lh character ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "this can be interpreted as the reminescent of the lh state of a qw with confinement length @xmath104 .",
    "the wavefunction of this level [ fig .",
    "[ fig : v - chd](d ) ] , in fact , is again well localized , analogously to the ground state , and in contrast to the wavefunctions of nearby states .",
    "we shall comment later on the fingerprints of this strongly lh - like state in the optical spectra , and , particularly , in the optical anisotropy .",
    "note also that in fig .  [",
    "fig : v - bande ] there are other `` jumps '' in the lh character at higher energies ; these correspond to energies where ladders of levels of different simmetries , like an additional nodal plane parallel to the [ 110 ] direction , begin .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : sl - vs - bk ] we compare the lh character vs subband energy at @xmath107 for samples with different barriers ( sl and pure alas ) .",
    "for both profiles a and b , the strong confinement due to alas barriers induces not only the expected blue - shift of the subbands , but also reduces the lh character of the lowest lh - like state , as compared to sl barriers : in sample a / sl , the @xmath119 doublet is 56% lh , while its counterpart in sample a / alas , the @xmath122 doublet , is only 42% lh . in sample b / sl , the @xmath123 doublet is 75% lh , while its counterpart in sample b / alas , the @xmath124 doublet , is only 52% lh .      in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - abs ] we show the calculated absorption intensity for the four samples of table  [ tab : samples ] and for light linearly polarized parallel to the wire axis , @xmath125 , and perpendicular to it along the [ 110 ] direction , @xmath126 .",

    "[ fig : v - abs ] ) . to identify the electron and hole states involved in each transition",
    ", we use the label @xmath129 , where @xmath13 and @xmath28 are , respectively , the indices of the conduction and valence states .",
    "we first focus on sample a / sl , for which experimental data are available .",
    "@xcite the calculated anisotropy in the low energy part ( @xmath130 ) is @xmath131 , with a deep minimum at @xmath132 , where the anisotropy is almost suppressed .",
    "both the average anisotropy and the position of the minimum are in _ quantitative _ agreement with experimental data .",
    "@xcite the agreement worsens at higher energies ( @xmath133 ) , where the calculated anisotropy drops rapidly and finally changes sign , while experimental data  @xcite show an increase .",
    "we believe that this discrepancy is due to our `` effective '' description of the barriers which affects particularly the higher - lying hole states .    by comparing the calculated anisotropy of the four samples",
    ", it appears that a more or less pronounced dip over a range of @xmath134 ( i.e. , the linewidth of the broadened spectra ) is always present in the low energy range of the spectrum , superimposed onto a background of an otherwise large and positive anisotropy .",
    "additional structure , particularly for sample a / alas , is also present in the high energy range .",
    "note also that the maximum anisotropy is in the range @xmath135 , and does not change dramatically in the different samples .    by studying the optical matrix elements",
    ", it can be shown that the dips in the anisotropy are due to states with a large lh character ,  @xcite e.g. , the @xmath136 subband in sample a / sl .",
    "since this is a localized state and has a large spatial overlap with the first conduction subband , it contributes to the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "this is true in general : as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : v - abs ] , for all samples the anisotropy dip corresponds to a @xmath107 transition ( highlighted as black bars in the histograms ) between the electron ground state ( @xmath137 ) and an excited hole state which is the @xmath136 , the @xmath138 , the @xmath139 , and the @xmath140 level for a / sl , a / alas , b / sl , and b / alas , respectively . for sample",
    "a / sl , comparison with fig .  [ fig : v - bande ] shows that the involved @xmath136 hole state has a strong lh character and its wavefunction ( fig .",
    "[ fig : v - chd](d ) ) is strongly localized .",
    "the large lh component makes that the intensity for the two polarizations is reversed with respect to the strongly hh - like ground state , causing the dip in the anisotropy at @xmath141 . a similar correspondence between the dip and a localized lh - like state applies also to the other samples .",
    "an immediate consequence of the above result is that , since both the ground hh state and the lh - like state couple with the lowest electron subband , _ the difference in energy between the onset of the continuum and the position of the dip in the anisotropy is a direct measure of the energy splitting between the ground hh and the first lh state , independently of the electron confinement_. note that such information can not be extracted from the absorption spectra alone , as the large broadening prevents the identification of any single transition apart from the fundamental one .",
    "the hh / lh splitting obtained in the above manner can be used to extract band structure parameters as , for example , the effective hole confinement @xmath101 . in the measured ple spectra for sample a / sl ,",
    "the anisotropy dip lies @xmath142 above the onset of the continuum ; in fig .",
    "[ fig : e - hh - lh ] we report the hh / lh splitting calculated for several values of @xmath101 ( full dots ) for this sample .",
    "we also show , for comparison , the hh / lh splitting calculated by a simple square well model for a qw of width @xmath104 ( empty dots ) , using the bulk hh and lh effective mass along [ 001 ] .",
    "it can be seen that the splitting is quite sensitive to @xmath101 , and that the experimental value is compatible with @xmath143 .",
    "this observation provides a good criterion for choosing the confinement energy of holes , which would otherwise be rather arbitrary .",
    "using this procedure , @xmath101 was finally taken equal to @xmath144 in ref .  .",
    "note that a variation of the valence band offset of @xmath145 shifts the hh / lh splitting of @xmath146 , well within the experimental accuracy for the determination of the hh / lh splitting .",
    "@xcite note also that , for a rough estimation of @xmath101 , calculations using a simple square well model may be sufficient .",
    "the comparison with the absorption spectra demonstrates that @xmath107 transitions alone give a poor estimate of the integrated spectrum .",
    "this is due to the dos contribution of the hole subbands which are strongly non parabolic , and have a large dos also for @xmath8-points away from @xmath107 ( see fig  [ fig : v - bande ] ) .",
    "finally , note the relaxation of selection rules for @xmath107 transitions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : v - abs ] . indeed ,",
    "if the envelope - function parity - conserving selection rule would be obeyed , only transitions of the type @xmath147 or @xmath148 ( depending on electron spin orientation ) would be allowed .",
    "we investigate a t - qwr with the geometry sketched in fig .",

    "[ fig : t - chd-1](a ) ] , although localized in the center of the t , is much more a qw2-like state , only weakly perturbed by coupling to qw1 ; accordingly , the lowest excited hole subbands [ fig .",

    "this is particularly useful because we expect that most of the states of fig .",
    "[ fig : t - bande ] simply arise from folding of qw states induced by the supercell periodicity and to the truncation of the t along the [ 110 ] direction . therefore , in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - bande ] we identify by full circles those states which , by direct inspection of the wavefunction , show a strong localization in the center of the t. indeed , it appears that only a limited subset has predominantly a localized character , and can therefore be assigned to quasi-1d qwr - like states or resonances .",
    "these include the localized states arising from the lowest two doublets , already discussed above , as well as the resonant states falling around 40 mev .",
    "the remaining states are similar to 2d qw - like states , with charge density localized mostly in qw1 or qw2 .    to clarify the origin of the large spin - splitting , it is useful to compare the band structure of the t - qwr with the hole subbands of the parent isolated qw1 and qw2 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : t - bande ] we show with open squares and open circles the lowest hh subband of qw1 and qw2 ; the lh subbands , for these thicknesses , lie high in energy ( @xmath153 in qw1 and @xmath154 in qw2 ) .",
    "@xcite a small gap of @xmath155 separates the two levels at @xmath107 ; as already noted above , the lowest state is qw2 , due to the larger hh mass . owing to different hh - lh mixing in each qw separately ,",
    "the hh subbands of the two parent qws have different energy dispersion as a function of @xmath8 and cross at some finite @xmath8 .",
    "large spin splittings are in general an effect of hh - lh mixing in asymmetric structures .",
    "@xcite in the present case , however , the energy difference between the hh and lh levels in each isolated qw is too large to explain the huge splitting that we have found in the lowest energy subbands of the qwr .",
    "naively , one would rather expect small gaps ( induced only indirectly by coupling to the far - lying lh states ) to open at the crossing of the qw1 and qw2 subbands .",
    "note , however , that the hh states of the parent qws are eigenstates of @xmath40 with @xmath108 , but _ with the quantization axis along different directions_. taking , for example , the @xmath40 quantization axis along [ 110 ] , a hh state of qw2 is @xmath156 ( for one of the degenerate spin orientations ) .",
    "a hh state of qw1 _ written in the same basis _ , is @xmath157 in words , a hh state of qw1 has a strong lh component from the point of view of qw2 .",
    "therefore , the lowest hh subbands arising from qw1 and qw2 are strongly coupled , which results in a strong avoided - crossing behaviour and a very large spin - splitting .",
    "this interpretation is supported by our calculation of the lh character , which is shown in the left panel of fig .",

    "fig : t - chd-1 ] ) , while the @xmath159 subbands are more than 60% lh .",
    "this should not be interpreted as a mixing with lh states of qw2 ; rather , it is a manifestation of the fact that this state is localized in qw1 and , therefore , does not have a well defined orbital character along [ 110 ] .",
    "we conclude our analysis of the lowest spin - split doublet by noting that , as @xmath8 increases , only the lowest level remains a well localized , quasi-1d state , while its spin companion gradually merges into the qw1 quasi - continuum ( at large wavevectors , qw1 becomes the ground state ) . for illustration",

    "we can identify four main structures , a peak around 1.65 ev , another peak around 1.68 ev ( with a minor shoulder on the low - energy side ) , a large composite structure beginning above 1.7 ev , and another large structure at 1.74 ev . of these",

    ".  [ fig : t - chd-1](d ) ] .",
    "the structure above 1.7 mev involves predominantly qw2 states , with a contributions from higher qwr resonances which produce the high energy shoulder in @xmath125 . finally , the large peak at 1.74 ev is due to many subbands , with a significant contribution from lh states belonging to both qws .",
    "the lowest three structures are polarization dependent with @xmath163 .",
    "the anisotropy is maximum for the second structure , for which @xmath126 is very small , consistently with the expectation for a ( 001 ) qw .",

    "the agreement with the calculated spectra is again surprisingly good , taking into account that these neglect excitonic effects .",
    "the experimental assignment of the first structure to a qwr - like state and the successive structures to qw1-like states , based on the comparison with reference qws , is fully consistent with our picture . as concerns intensities , the agreement is also reasonably good if one considers that the weight of the qwr peak is sensitive to the relative volume occupied by the qws , which enters the calculation through the choice of the supercell . on the other hand ,",
    "the reasons of an enhanced intensity of qw1-like features in the ple experimental data are discussed in ref .  .",

    "the corresponding theoretical values from fig .",
    "[ fig : t - abs ] are approximately @xmath166 and @xmath167 ( the coefficients are slightly larger , 0.57 and 0.17 respectively , if the broadening is reduced to @xmath168 ) .",
    "the very different anisotropy of the two structures is therefore in qualitative agreement with experiments , although further investigation would be required to understand the origin of the difference .",
    "we have presented an accurate and efficient approach that allows us to calculate the electronic and optical properties of quantum wires , taking into account valence band mixing effects together with realistic profiles of the confining potentials .",
    "we have studied specifically v- and t - shaped quantum wires , where the shape of the confinement region differs considerably from the model geometries assumed in most of the previous investigations .",
    "the two classes of wires differ significantly in the structure of their energy spectra : while the crescent shape of v - qwrs induces a series of localized quasi-1d levels , only the lowest states of t - qwrs are clearly localized in the wire because of the subsequent onset of the continua of the parent quantum wells .",
    "the consequences on the optical spectra have been discussed in detail . in particular ,",
    "we have focused on the optical anisotropy , and demonstrated that the analysis of anisotropy spectra can be used as an effective tool to extract information on valence states , usually very difficult to obtain otherwise .",
    "comparison with very recent ple spectra for both classes of wires shows good agreement , in spite of our neglecting excitonic effects .",
    "as we discussed in the introduction , this agreement might be due to the symmetry properties of the coulomb interaction and , therefore , might be a rather genereal feature .",
    "however , while the approximation of neglecting excitonic effects is very convenient from the computational point of view , its accuracy for a given class of materials should be established a posteriori from comparison to experiments , as we have positively tested in this paper for v - qwrs and t - qwrs .    as a final remark ,",
    "we stress that all our calculations have been performed by a numerical method which prooved computationally very convenient .",
    "furthermore , our method lends itself to include calculations of coulomb correlation effects on the linear and non linear optical properties of these wires which are currently implemented only for non - interacting valence bands,@xcite as well as to include external magnetic fields  @xcite to interpret magneto - luminescence experiments .",

    ". it can be noted , however , that convergence is achieved only within @xmath178 with @xmath179 as high as 280 , which corresponds to @xmath180 and @xmath181 ; these , in turn , should be compared with the low barrier height of this sample , which is @xmath144 .",
