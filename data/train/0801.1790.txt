    "in many spintronic device designs , spin precession during transport from injector to detector plays a primary role in determining device output characteristics .",
    "this precession is caused by a torque exerted either by effective@xcite or real@xcite magnetic fields oriented perpendicular to the spin direction .",
    "because of magnetic field inhomogeneities or transit time uncertainty , transported spins will arrive at the spin detector with a distribution of precession angles .",
    "when the angular distribution width approaches 2@xmath0 , the contributions of spin - polarized electrons to the detector output is reduced by partial signal cancellation of oppositely - oriented spins , in a process called `` dephasing '' , or `` hanle effect''@xcite .",
    "dephasing in spin - transport devices ( especially when due to transit - time uncertainty caused by spatial diffusion or pathlength variation ) can not be reversed , as it can be with spin - echo techniques in electron spin resonance ( where transport plays no role)@xcite .",
    "therefore , spin dephasing is a physical process of fundamental importance to semiconductor spintronic devices . here , we present analysis of a spin drift - diffusion model to quantify the effects of dephasing in a regime where charge transport is dominated by drift , as in recent experiments@xcite .",
    "we examine the apparent independence of relative dephasing ( precession fringe visibility in magnetic field spectroscopy ) to injector - detector distance ( transit length ) and quantify the effects of voltage bias across the transport region .",
    "these conclusions are bolstered through comparison to experiment , using silicon spin - transport devices@xcite .",
    "in addition , the effects of temperature on spin dephasing are discussed .",
    "since spin detection is invariably a projection of the electron spin on a fixed measurement axis , the change in output of a spintronics device employing precession will be determined by @xmath1 ( to first order ) , where @xmath2 is spin angle , and @xmath3 is spin precession frequency and @xmath4 is transit time from injector to detector over transit length @xmath5 .",
    "clearly , transit - time uncertainty @xmath6 gives rise to precession angle uncertainty @xmath7 .",
    "increasing precession frequency ( @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is electron spin g - factor , @xmath10 is the bohr magneton , @xmath11 is the reduced planck s constant , and @xmath12 is perpendicular magnetic field ) by increasing the magnetic field therefore increases the angular uncertainty @xmath13 and causes dephasing . a complete model for dephasing during transport from injector to detector",
    "is therefore needed .",
    "electron transport in a semiconductor is well - described by the drift - diffusion equation . to model spin transport accurately , finite spin - lifetime must be included within the relaxation - time approximation :    @xmath14    where @xmath15 is the spin density , @xmath16 represents the spin relaxation time , @xmath17 is the diffusion coefficient for electrons , and @xmath18 is the electron drift velocity . in the `` ohmic '' regime , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is mobility and",

    "a typical experiment consists of a spectroscopy where perpendicular magnetic field strength @xmath12 is varied ; spin precession oscillations ( where extrema correspond to average precession angles in integer multiples of @xmath0 ) are suppressed in larger magnetic fields due to a larger precession - angle uncertainty .",
