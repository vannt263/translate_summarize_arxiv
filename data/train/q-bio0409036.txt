    "according to textbooks , gene expression is a very complicated dynamical process which is regulated at a number of its stages during the synthesis of proteins @xcite . similar to many big cities , with heavy traffic , biological cells host complicated traffic of biochemical signals at all levels . at the nanometer scale ,",
    "clusters of molecules in the form of proteins drive the dynamics of the cellular network that schematically can be divided into four regulated parts : the dna or genes , the transcribed rnas , the set of interacting proteins , and the metabolites .",
    "genes can only affect other genes through specific proteins , as well as through some metabolic pathways that are regulated by proteins themselves .",
    "they act to catalyze the information stored in dna , all the way from the fundamental processes of transcription and translation to the final quantities of produced proteins .",
    "+ for the purpose of modeling , it is essential to generate simple models that help to understand elementary dynamical components of these complex regulatory networks as molecular tools that participate in an important way in the machinery of cellular decisions , that is to say , in the behavior and genetic program of cells .",
    "the central importance of control theory in biology can be assessed through the recent problem of identifying control motifs ( or modules ) , which are patterns that occur in a gene network far more often than in randomized networks of biological regulators @xcite .",
    "this hot issue has been first pinpointed in a breakthrough paper of doyle and collaborators @xcite in which the regulation of bacterial chemotaxis was interpreted in terms of the simple integral control ` adaptive module ' introduced by barkai and leibler @xcite .",
    "since gene regulation appears to occur only at some definite states of the whole process , which in general are not well known , we are from the point of view of control engineering in the case of the reconstruction of those specific states under the condition of limited information .",
    "+ it is quite clear that the availability of all state variables to direct measurement is an extremely rare occasion for gene expression phenomena or when it is possible it could be too expensive . for this particular task , but in completely different technological areas , the engineers have developed software sensors ( state observers ) that accurately reconstruct the state variables of various technological processes @xcite .",
    "the basic concept of state of a system or process could have many different empirical meanings in biology .",
    "for the particular case of gene expression , the meaning of a state is essentially that of a concentration .",
    "the typical problem in control engineering that appears to be tremendously useful in biology is the reconstruction of some specific regulated states under conditions of limited information .",
    "+ in general , an observer is expected to provide a good estimate @xmath0 of the natural state @xmath1 of the original system . for this , one usually can think that some distance @xmath2 ( in the sense of a norm @xmath3 in a vectorial space ) goes to zero as @xmath4 .",
    "such softwares can be constructed using the mathematical model of the process to obtain an estimate @xmath5 of the true state @xmath6 .",
    "this estimate can then be used as a substitute for the unknown state @xmath6 .",
    "the usage of state observers has proven useful in process monitoring and for many other tasks .",
    "the concept of observer is used herein in the sense of control theory , defining an algorithm capable of giving a reasonable estimation of the unmeasured variables of a process . in the case of",
    "gene expression processes the description is made very concrete in the following by looking at quite simple mathematical models that refer to single gene cases and which in principle can be extended to some _ operons _ that are single gene clusters .",
    "+ in this paper we will examine in detail a particularly simple observer due to gauthier and collaborators @xcite possessing arbitrary exponential decay and linear error dynamics for the case of a three - state genetic regulation process .",
    "we were led to consider this observer because of its simplicity and its _ high gain _ property .",
    "the gain is defined as the amount of increase in error in the dynamics of the observer .",
    "this amount is directly related to the velocity with which the observer recovers the unknown signal .",
    "for the observer of gauthier _ et al _ the amount of increase in error is constant and usually of high values leading to a fast recover of the unmeasurable states .",
    "a kinetic model of a simple genetic regulation process was first developed by goodwin as long ago as 1963 @xcite .",
    "it has been further generalized by tyson and othmer @xcite and clearly explained by de jong in his recent review @xcite .",
    "we consider here the most simple version of this kinetic model . for three concentrations @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , corresponding to the messenger rna ( mrna ) that codes for the unstable enzyme , the enzyme , and the metabolite , respectively , we write tyson s model in the form    @xmath10    the parameters @xmath11 are all strictly positive and represent production constants , whereas @xmath12 are also strictly positive degradation constants .",
    "these rate equations express a balance between the number of molecules appearing and disappearing per unit time .",
    "notice that the model assumes that the concentration @xmath8 increases linearly with @xmath7 and the concentration @xmath9 linearly with @xmath8 , which are natural assumptions . in the case of @xmath7 ,",
    "the first term is the production term involving a nonlinear nondissipative _ regulation function _ @xmath13 that we take of the @xmath14-steepen hill form ( @xmath15 is the steepness parameter ) in common use    @xmath16    for the activation and inhibition cases , respectively .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 gives the threshold for the regulatory influence of the concentration of the metabolite on the target gene , whereas the steepness parameter @xmath14 is a measure of the collective effect of groups of metabolite molecules and also defines the shape of the hill curve .",
    "this nonlinear parametrization describes the ` biological regulation process ' that includes the production of the mrna by transcription of its structural gene , its possible intranuclear processing by cleavage , its enzymatic degradation within the nucleus , and its migration to the cytoplasm by some form of diffusion or biological transport .",
    "once in the cytoplasm , the mrna is both translated into the unstable enzyme and enzymatically degraded .",
    "system @xmath18 and its trivial chain generalization in the linear part is considered to be a good model for the simplest type of allosteric regulation in biochemistry , i.e. , the inhibition or activation of an enzyme or protein by a small regulatory molecule that interacts with the enzyme at a site ( allosteric site ) other than the active site at which catalytic activity occurs .",
    "the interaction changes the shape of the enzyme , thus affecting the active site of the standard catalysis .",
    "this change of shape of the enzyme is sufficient to change its ability to catalyze a reaction in either negative or positive way and enables a cell to regulate needed metabolites .",
    "the allosteric regulation has the typical features of a feedback loop in control theory if the regulatory protein acts on the enzyme in the pathway of its own synthesis .",
    "many attempts have been made to develop nonlinear observer design methods .",
    "one could mention the industrially popular extended kalman filter , whose design is based on a local linearization of the system around a reference trajectory , restricting the validity of the approach within a small region in the state space @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the first systematic approach for the development of a theory of nonlinear observers was proposed some time ago by krener and isidori @xcite . in further works ,",
    "nonlinear transformations of the coordinates have also been employed to put the considered nonlinear sytem in a suitable `` observer canonical form '' , in which the observer design problem may be easily solved @xcite,@xcite,@xcite . the main idea in this case is to find a state transformation to represent the system as a linear differential equation plus a nonlinear term , which is a function of the measured state .    in this section ,",
    "we present the design of a nonlinear software sensor in which the metabolite concentration is the naturally measured state ( the most easy to measure ) and corresponds to the mathematical state @xmath9 in the model introduced in the previous section .",
    "therefore , it seems logical to take @xmath9 as the output of the system @xmath19 we now apply the technique of high - gain observers that works for many nonlinear systems and guarantees that the output feedback controller recovers the performance of the state feedback controller when the observer s gain is sufficiently high .",
    "the model given by the aforementioned system @xmath18 has the form    @xmath20    in which @xmath21 , and moreover there is a `` physical subset '' @xmath22 where the system lies . to make this mathematically precise",
    "we must introduce some further mathematical terminology .",
    "let us construct the @xmath23th time derivative of the output .",
    "this can be expressed using lie differentiation of the function @xmath24 by the vector field @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "@xmath27 is the @xmath23th lie derivative of @xmath24 by @xmath25 and a function of @xmath6 defined inductively as follows    @xmath28    when @xmath29 is observable , the map @xmath30 is a diffeomorphism where    @xmath31~.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for @xmath32 to be a local diffeomorphism in a region @xmath33 , it is necessary and sufficient that the jacobian @xmath34 should be nonsingular on @xmath33 and moreover that @xmath32 is one - to - one from @xmath33 to @xmath35 , see @xcite .",
    "notice , that no matter if we choose @xmath36 or @xmath37 , the coordinate transformation is the same .",
    "this means that the structure of the observer will be the same for both cases : gene activation or inhibition .",
    "+ when the system is observable on @xmath33 , it can be rewritten in the global coordinate system defined by @xmath32 in the following matrix form :    @xmath38 = \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } { { \\xi}}_2\\\\ { { \\xi}}_3\\\\ \\varphi \\left ( { \\xi } \\right ) \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] \\\\ y = c \\ \\xi = [ 1\\ 0\\ 0]\\ \\left [ \\begin{array}{c } { { \\xi}}_1\\\\ { { \\xi}}_2\\\\ { { \\xi}}_3 \\\\ \\end{array } \\right ] \\end{array } \\right . ~,%\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where , moreover , @xmath39 can be extended from @xmath33 to the entire @xmath40 by a @xmath41 function globally lipschitz on @xmath40 .",
    "the latter form allows us to make use of the following result proven by gauthier and collaborators @xcite : + _ consider the system @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the solution of the matrix equation @xmath44 for @xmath17 large enough , with @xmath45 a matrix of brunovsky form ( @xmath46 ; @xmath47 is the kronecker symbol ) , which plays the role of a shift operator on @xmath48 . then , eq .",
    "( [ observ coord trans ] ) defines an observer for @xmath49 , with @xmath50 _ in our case , an observer is a dynamical system as given by eq .",
    "( [ observ coord trans ] ) that hill track the trajectory of the original system ( here @xmath49 ) .",
    "notice that both systems are identical unless an additional term that compensate the error in the observer , where the error is given by the difference @xmath51 , which is seen to be exponentially decreasing in time .",
    "the gauthier observer is particularly simple since it appears to be only a copy of @xmath52 , together with a correction term that depends only on the dimension of the state space and not on the system @xmath53 itself . in others",
    "words , the structure of the observer does not depend on the hill steepness parameter @xmath14 ( eq .  ( [ eqn1 ] ) ) . + for the sake of concreteness we will construct the observer only for the activation case .",
    "however , one should notice that only the function @xmath54 will change for the inhibition case .",
    "the gauthier observer in eq .",

    "we work with @xmath62 and the values of the parameters given in table  1 that are not necessarily the experimental values but are consistent with the requirements of the model .",
    "figure ( [ simulaciones ] ) shows the results of a numerical simulation , where the solid lines represent the true states and the dotted lines stand for the estimates , respectively .",
    "in addition , for the real system we have taken @xmath63 whereas for the observer @xmath64 in order to show the robustness of this type of nonlinear observer with respect to the steepness parameter .",

    "however , for more complex inputs of more complicated observable dynamical systems , this constant gain observer could have less performance and be overcome by some _ adaptive _ observers that can change in order to work better or provide more fit for a particular purpose . in the case of more limited information ,",
