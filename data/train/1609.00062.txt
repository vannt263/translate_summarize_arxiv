    "the vision of the future internet - of - things ( iot ) is to connect tens of billions of low - complexity wireless devices ( e.g. , sensors and wearable computing devices ) , which are coordinated to enable new applications such as smart cities , home automation and e - healthcare . designing the iot physical layer faces several challenges .",
    "for instance , battery replacement or recharging for the massive number of iot devices is difficult or even infeasible as many may be deployed in hazardous environments or hidden in e.g. , walls and furniture .",
    "furthermore , ad hoc communications between dense iot devices causes severe interference that is a bottleneck on the network throughput . to tackle these challenges , the design of full - duplex _ backscatter communication _ ( backcom ) networks for supporting simultaneous one - way energy transfer ( et ) and two - way information transfer ( it ) in coexisting iot links",
    "is proposed in this paper .",
    "the interference in such networks is suppressed by the proposed multiple - access scheme based on the _ time hopping spread spectrum _ ( th - ss ) that is also designed to facilitate wireless et .",
    "furthermore , the full - duplex it is enabled by the superposition of coherent and non - coherent modulation given th - ss and backscatter .",
    "backcom has been mostly implemented for radio - frequency identification ( rfid ) applications where devices connected to the grid , called _ readers _ , wirelessly power passive devices , called _ tags _ , to feed back i d data @xcite . a tag harvests energy from an unmodulated carrier wave transmitted by the reader , and modulates and reflects a fraction of the wave by adapting the level of antenna impedance mismatch @xcite .",
    "this operation does not require the tag to have any active rf component ( such as analog - to - digital converter , power amplifier and local oscillator ) or an internal power source .",
    "this results in passive and extremely low - complexity hardware with small form factors , making backcom a promising solution for implementing low - cost and ultra - dense iot networks .    _",
    "backcom systems : _ for this reason , active research has been conducted on designing techniques for various types of backcom systems and networks which are more complex than the traditional  rfid systems@xcite .",
    "one focus of the research is to design multiple - access backcom networks where  a single reader serves multiple tags .",
    "as proposed in @xcite , collision can be avoided by directional beamforming at the reader and decoupling tags covered by the same beam using the frequency - shift keying modulation .",
    "subsequently , alternative multiple - access schemes were proposed in @xcite and @xcite based on time - division multiple access and collision - detection - carrier - sensing based random access , respectively .",
    "a novel approach for collision avoidance was presented in @xcite which treats backscatter transmissions by tags as a sparse code and decodes multi - tag data using a compressive - sensing algorithm .",
    "_ et in backcom systems : _ iot devices having the capabilities of sensing and computing consume more power than simple rfid tags and also require much longer it / et ranges ( rfid ranges are limited to only several meters ) .",
    "this calls for techniques for enhancing the et efficiency in backcom systems by leveraging the rich results from the popular area of wireless power transfer ( e.g. , see the surveys in @xcite ) . in  @xcite",
    ", it was proposed that a reader is provisioned with multi - antennas to beam energy to multiple tags .",
    "an algorithm was also provided therein for the reader to estimate the forward - link channel , which is required for energy beamforming , using the backscattered pilot signal also transmitted by the reader .",
    "the wet efficiency can be also enhanced by reader cooperation .",
    "for example , multiple readers are coordinated to perform et ( and it ) to a single tag as proposed in @xcite .",
    "the implementation of such designs require backcom network architectures with centralized control .",
    "however , iot relies primarily on distributed _ device - to - device _ ( d2d ) communication .",
    "large - scale distributed d2d backcom are modeled and analyzed in @xcite using stochastic geometry , where tags are wirelessly powered by dedicated stations ( called power beacons ) . in particular , the network transmission capacity that measures the network spatial throughput",
    "was derived and maximized as a function of backscatter parameters including duty cycle and reflection coefficient . instead of relying on peer - to - peer et ,",
    "an alternative approach of powering iot devices is to harvest ambient rf energy from transmissions by wifi access points or tv towers  @xcite .",
    "_ backcom systems with d2d communication : _ conventional backcom techniques designed for rfid applications mostly target simple single - tag systems and one - way it from a tag to a reader",
    ". nevertheless , iot is much more complex where there are massive number of iot devices devices performing d2d communication .",
    "this prompts researcher to design more sophisticated and versatile backcom techniques to improve the data rates and mitigate interference .",
    "an energy harvesting d2d backcom system was designed in @xcite that features a full - duplex backcom link where high - rate data and a low - rate control signal are transmitted in the opposite directions using on - off keying and binary _ amplitude modulation _ ( am ) , respectively , which are superimposed exploiting their asymmetric bit - rates . in backcom systems with coexisting links",
    ", interference is a much more severe issue than that in conventional systems due to _ interference regeneration _ by reflection at all nodes having backscatter antennas .",
    "the idea of mitigating interference using th - ss was first proposed in @xcite for an ultra - wide band ( uwb ) rfid ( backcom ) system .",
    "the drawback of such a system is that the required accurate analog detection of ultra - sharp uwb pulses places a stringent requirement for hardware implementation and may not be suitable for low complexity iot devices .",
    "full - duplex d2d communications between iot devices is desirable as it reduces latency and enables efficient spectrum utilization .",
    "the conventional approach for enabling full - duplex transmission over a single link relies on self - interference cancellation @xcite .",
    "the implementation requires sophisticated adaptive analog - and - digital signal processing that is unsuitable for low - complexity and low - power iot devices .",
    "the mentioned full - duplex backcom design in @xcite is much simpler and supports only low data rates that are sufficient for iot links .",
    "however , the drawback of the design is the requirement of asymmetric rates for transmissions in the opposite directions since it targets mixed transmissions of data and control signals .",
    "we consider a backcom interference network comprising @xmath0 coexisting pairs reader - tag .",
    "each reader is provisioned with reliable power supply and performs both et and it to an intended tag that transmits data back to the reader by backscatter . targeting this network , a novel multiple - access scheme , called _ time - hopping full - duplex backcom _ ,",
    "is proposed to simultaneously mitigate interference and enable full - duplex communication .",
    "these two features are realized by two components of the scheme .",
    "first , the interference - mitigation feature of the scheme relies on an extension of th - ss to also support et from readers to tags . to this end",
    ", we propose the novel _ sequence - switch modulation _",
    "scheme where a bit is transmitted from a reader to a tag by switching between a pair of th - ss sequences each containing a single random nonzero _ on - chip_. besides reducing the interference power by the sequence length ( also known as the processing gain ) @xcite , the design not only supports et for every symbol via the transmission of a nonzero chip but also satisfies the constraint of non - coherent detection at tags using energy detectors  @xcite .",
    "each tag also continuously harvests energy from interference .    next , to realize the full - duplex feature of time - hopping backcom , the backward transmission from a tag to a reader",
    "is implemented such that each tag modulates the transmitted on - chip in the corresponding th - ss sequence using the binary - phase - shift keying ( bpsk ) and a reader performs coherent demodulation to detect the bit thus transmitted .",
    "the bpsk modulation at a tag is operated by switching two impedances chosen according to the reflection coefficients having zero and @xmath1-degree phase shifts .",
    "compared with the previous design of full - duplex backcom in @xcite , the proposed technique has the advantages of supporting symmetric full - duplex data rates and interference mitigation .    the performance of the proposed time - hopping full - duplex backcom scheme is thoroughly analyzed in this paper in terms of _ bit - error rate _ ( ber ) for it and the expected _ energy - transfer rate _ ( etr ) and the _ energy - outage probability _ for et .",
    "the main results are summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "( synchronous transmissions ) first , consider a typical link in a two - link backcom interference system where the time - hopping full - duplex backcom scheme is deployed .",
    "assume chip synchronization between links .",
    "from the it perspective , the bers for the forward ( reader - to - tag ) and the backward ( tag - to - reader ) transmissions are derived for both the cases of static and fading channels .",
    "the results quantify the effects of th - ss on mitigating the original and regenerated interference .",
    "specifically , the bers for forward transmission with non - coherent detection are shown to diminish inversely with the _ sequence length _",
    "@xmath2 in the interference - limited regime .",
    "moreover , the bers for backward transmission with coherent detection converge to those of classic bpsk , denoted as @xmath3 , approximately as @xmath4 . from the et perspective",
    ", the expected etr and the energy - outage probability are derived .",
    "in particular , as @xmath2 increases , the expected etr is observed to diminish if the power of nonzero chips are fixed , i.e. , the power constrained case , or converge to the derived constants if the energy of each nonzero chip if fixed , i.e. , the energy constrained case .",
    "( asynchronous transmissions ) next , the assumption of chip synchronization is relaxed .",
    "the preceding results are extended to the case of ( chip ) asynchronous transmissions .",
    "it is found that the lack of synchronization between coexisting links degrades the ber performance for both forward and backward transmissions .",
    "for example , in the high snr regime , the ber for backward transmission is approximately doubled . nevertheless , the effects of asynchronous transmissions on et are negligible , as the ber even after deterioration is still at an acceptable level .",
    "3 .   ( @xmath0-link systems )",
    "last , the performance analysis for the two - link systems is generalized to a @xmath0-link system .",
    "it is shown that the ber for forward transmission as well as the expected etrs are approximately proportional to @xmath5 .",
    "* notation * : @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the modulus and the conjugate of a complex number @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "@xmath9 denotes the real part of a complex number .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the expectation of a random variable @xmath11 .",
    "@xmath12 denotes the probability of the event @xmath13 .",
    "@xmath14 denotes the indicator function , i.e. , @xmath14 is equal to one if @xmath13 is true or otherwise , is equal to zero .",
    "we consider a backcom system consisting of @xmath0 coexisting single - antenna reader - tag pairs .",
    "each reader is provisioned with a full - duplex antenna ( see e.g.,@xcite ) allowing simultaneous transmission and reception . for simplicity , it is assumed that self - interference ( from transmission to reception ) at the reader due to the use of a full - duplex antenna is perfectly cancelled .",
    "each passive tag uses a backscatter antenna for transmission by backscattering a fraction of the incident signal and an energy harvester for harvesting the energy in the remaining fraction .",
    "each pair of intended reader and tag communicate by full - duplex transmission with robustness against interference using the design presented in the next section .",
    "the architecture of such a full - duplex passive tag is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : circuit ] . the baseband additive white gaussian noise ( awgn ) at reader  @xmath15",
    "is represented by the random variable @xmath16 with variance @xmath17 .",
    "the passband noise signal at tag  @xmath15 is @xmath18 with variance @xmath19 .",
    "it is assumed that all the readers / tags share the same band for communication .",
    "block fading is assumed such that the channel coefficients remain unchanged within a symbol duration but may vary from symbol - to - symbol .",
    "we consider both the static and rayleigh fading channels , corresponding to the cases with or without mobility , respectively . the _ channel state information _ ( csi ) of the intended backscatter channel ( reader - to - tag - to - reader ) is available at the corresponding reader .",
    "however , the csi of interference channels is not available at the reader .",
    "moreover , tags have no knowledge of any channel .",
    "the forward channel coefficient between reader  @xmath20 and tag  @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath22 , while the backward channel coefficient between tag  @xmath20 and reader  @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "in addition , @xmath24 is the channel coefficient between readers  @xmath20 and @xmath21 , while @xmath25 is the channel coefficient between tags  @xmath20 and  @xmath21 . we also assume reciprocity between the forward and backward channels , i.e. , @xmath26 .",
    "the distance between reader  @xmath20 and tag  @xmath21 is denoted by @xmath27 .",
    "it is important to note that the interference in a backcom interference channel is more severe and complex than that in a conventional one .",
    "this is mainly due to _ interference regeneration _ by backscatter antennas at tags that reflect all incident signals including both data and interference signals . as an example",
    ", a two - link system is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : signals ] where interference regeneration is illustrated .",
    "the performance metrics are defined as follows . both the ber for the backward and forward it are analyzed in the sequel . for the forward et , we consider two metrics : ( i ) the _ expected _ etr , denoted as @xmath28 and defined as the expected harvested energy at a tag per symbol , and ( ii ) the energy - outage probability , denoted as @xmath29 and defined as the probability that the harvested energy at the tag during a symbol duration is below the tag s fixed energy consumption , denoted as @xmath30 .",
    "note that @xmath28 and @xmath29 are related to the cases of large or small energy storage at tags , respectively .",
    "specifically , a larger energy storage performs averaging over the random energy arrivals ; given a small or no storage , the instantaneous harvested energy is required to exceed the circuit power so as to operate the tag circuit , making @xmath29 a relevant metric .",
    "the proposed time - hopping full - duplex backcom scheme comprises two components , namely the sequence - switch modulation and full - duplex backcom , which are designed in the following sub - sections .",
    "the sequence - switch modulation used by each reader is designed for several purposes .",
    "the first is to suppress interference by th - ss .",
    "the second is to enable simultaneous it and et under the constraint of non - coherent detection at the intended tag by energy detection  @xcite .",
    "last , the modulation should support full - duplex backcom by allowing a reader to transmit a carrier wave for backscatter by the intended tag .",
    "let a symbol duration @xmath31 be uniformly divided into @xmath2 slots called _",
    "chips_. for the mentioned purposes , define a _ th - ss sequence _ as a @xmath2-chip random sequence comprising only a _",
    "single _ randomly located nonzero chip while others are silent .",
    "each link is assigned a pair of sequences with different nonzero chips to represent  0 \" and  1 \" of a bit .",
    "then switching the sequences enables the transmission of a binary - bit stream , giving the name of sequence - switch modulation .",
    "consider the generation of a pair of th - ss sequences .",
    "the first sequence can be generated by randomly placing a ( nonzero ) _",
    "on_-chip in one of the @xmath2 chip positions and the second sequence by putting the corresponding nonzero chip randomly in one of those chip - positions corresponding to zeros of the first sequence .",
    "a pair of th - ss sequences for a particular link , say the @xmath15-th link , can be represented by the indices ( or positions ) of the corresponding pair of on - chips , denoted as @xmath32 and called a _ th - ss pattern _ [ see fig .",
    "[ fig : chips](a ) ] , while all the other chips are the _ off - chips_. note that there exist @xmath33 available patterns in total .",
    "the generation of the th - ss patterns for different links are assumed independent .",
    "the transmission of a single bit by reader @xmath15 can be equivalently represented by a binary random variable @xmath34 with support @xmath35 , called a transmitted on - chip . assuming chip synchronization between links , their transmissions in an arbitrary symbol duration",
    "can be represented by a set of i.i.d .",
    "random variables @xmath36 and illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : chips](b ) .",
    "how the above design of sequence - switch modulation serves the mentioned purposes is discussed as follows .",
    "first , interference between two links arises when their th - ss patterns overlap and thereby causes detection errors at their intended tags .",
    "the likelihood of pattern overlapping reduces with the increasing sequence length @xmath2 as the patterns become increasingly sparse .",
    "consider two coexisting links with th - ss patterns @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "given the design of sequence - switch modulation , there exist three scenarios for the relation between the two patterns , namely _ non - overlapping _ ( @xmath39 ) , _ single - chip overlapping _ ( @xmath40 ) , and _ dual - chip overlapping _ ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "for each scenario , the actual transmitted on - chips may or may not _ collide _ with each other . thus each scenario can be further divided into multiple cases as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : all_chips ] .",
    "next , the modulation design facilitates non - coherent detection at tags using energy detectors . for a particular link , since the assigned th - ss pattern is known to both the reader and tag , the tag detects the transmitted bit by estimating which of the two on - chips in the pattern is transmitted using an energy detector .",
    "furthermore , the design of sequence - switch modulation enables et simultaneous with it by having an on - chip in every symbol duration for delivering energy to the intended tag .",
    "in addition , the tag also harvests energy from on - chips from the interference channels . as a result",
    ", the design achieves an et efficiency at least twice of that by using the on - off keying , namely switching between a th - ss sequence and a all - zero sequence .",
    "last , this design feature of having an on - chip in every data symbol facilitate full - duplex backcom .",
    "specifically , the carrier wave modulating each on - chip is modulated and backscattered by the intended tag for backward it .",
    "the details are provided in the sequel .",
    "building on the sequence - switch modulation in the preceding subsection , the full - duplex backcom is realized by the joint operation of the intended reader and tag designed as follows .",
    "consider the reader side of a particular link .",
    "a reader using one full - duplex antenna to transmit a forward bit stream using the sequence - switch modulation by sending a carrier wave represented by @xmath42 during the on - chip , where @xmath43 is the transmission power and @xmath44 is the angular frequency . at the same time",
    ", the reader receives the tag s backscattered signal at the same antenna . after cancelling the self - interference from its transmission",
    ", the reader detects the backward bit stream by bpsk demodulation / detection of the backscattered signals in the intervals corresponding to the transmitted on - chips that are known to the reader .",
    "the reader discards the received signals in other intervals since they are interference .",
    "note that this operation requires the chip - level synchronization between a pair of intended reader and tag .",
    "next , consider the tag side of the link . during the off - chips of the assigned th - ss pattern ,",
    "the tag disconnects the modulation block and harvests energy from the other readers transmissions ( see the tag architecture in fig .  [",
    "fig : circuit ] ) . given the rf energy harvesting efficiency @xmath45",
    ", only @xmath45 portion of the rf receive power is harvested . during the two on - chip intervals of each instance of the pattern ( or equivalently each symbol ) ,",
    "the tag connects the modulation block and detects a forward bit by comparing the amounts of energy obtained from the two intervals using an energy detector .",
    "based on the detection results , the tag estimates the transmitted on - chip positions and modulated / backscattered the signals in the corresponding chip intervals .",
    "note that interference signal in either one or two of the on - chips may result in failure of the tag on detecting the corresponding forward bit .",
    "the variable impedance at the tag ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : circuit ] ) is implemented by switching between two fixed impedances chosen to generate two reflection coefficients with the same magnitudes , namely @xmath46 , but different phase shifts , namely zero and @xmath1 degrees . then adapting the variable impedance to the backward bit streams modulates the backscatter signals with the bits by bpsk .",
    "let the bpsk symbol transmitted by tag @xmath15 be denoted as @xmath47 with @xmath48 .",
    "thus , during the two on - chip intervals , the tag backscatters a fraction , denoted as @xmath49 with @xmath50 , of the incident signal power and harvests the remaining fraction of @xmath51 .    combining the aforementioned reader and",
    "tag operations realize the full - duplex backcom with symmetric backward and forward it rates .",
    "in this section , we analyze the ber for the backward and forward it . for simplicity ,",

    "as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec_sys ] and sec .",
    "[ sec_design ] , the receive baseband signal at reader  1 during its transmitted on - chip @xmath53 can be written as @xmath54 where the two indicator functions indicate whether tag  2 is backscattering and whether reader  2 is transmitting during reader  1 s transmitted on - chip @xmath53 , respectively .",
    "the first and the second  term  in   correspond to the useful signal r1-t1-r1 and the interference signal r1-t2-r1 , respectively ,  and  the third term corresponds to the interference signals r2-r1 , r2-t1-r1 , and r2-t2-r1 as  illustrated  in  fig .  [",
    "fig : signals ] .    given interference at reader  1",
    ", the ber of coherent detection can be close to the maximum of @xmath55 and thus is assumed as @xmath55 when reader  1 suffers interference for simplicity .",
    "then the ber at reader  @xmath52 can be written as @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the ber for bpsk detection without interference , and together with the probabilities @xmath58 are defined as follows : @xmath59 substituting into , we obtain the ber for the backward it at the reader :    [ proposition_1 ] the expected ber for the backward it is @xmath60 where it can be derived straightforwardly based on the statistics of the channel coefficients that @xmath61 and @xmath62 and @xmath63 are the q - function and the complementary error function @xcite , respectively .",
    "the ber for the backward it decreases inversely with the reflection coefficient  @xmath49 . for the high snr regime ( @xmath64 ) , the ber reduces to @xmath65 , which is caused by the interference and decreases inversely with the th - ss sequence length @xmath2 .",
    "it is interesting to investigate the ber scaling law w.r.t .",
    "the sequence length @xmath2 .",
