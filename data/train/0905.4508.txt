    "the temperature structure of the intracluster medium ( icm ) in central regions of galaxy clusters is bimodal .",
    "the non - cooling core clusters have isothermal icm cores with low densities and hence long radiative cooling times . on the other hand ,",
    "the central regions of the icm in cooling core clusters have radiative cooling times that can be as short as @xmath2years . within the cooling radius ( the location where the radiative cooling time is comparable to the hubble time and hence the age of the cluster ) ,",
    "the temperature decreases with decreasing radius ( peterson & fabian 2006 ) . given the short cooling time , it is profoundly puzzling that the cores of these clusters have not undergone a cooling catastrophe .",
    "the current paradigm is that the central active galactic nucleus ( agn ) heats the icm ; this remains one of the most direct arguments for `` agn feedback '' .",
    "however , early work ( binney & cowie 1981 ) highlighted the possible role that thermal conduction may play in these clusters .",
    "our understanding of the action of thermal conduction in atmospheres such as the icm is undergoing a revolution . because the icm plasma is very dilute , thermal conduction will act in a very anisotropic manner , occurring essentially unchecked along magnetic field lines but being very strongly suppressed perpendicular to field lines .",
    "this elementary fact has profound implications for the dynamics and structure of the icm ( or , indeed , any dilute plasma atmosphere ) . as shown by @xcite ,",
    "the anisotropy of conduction fundamentally alters the schwarzschild criterion for convection  rather than requiring an inverted _ entropy _ gradient , convection in such an magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) atmosphere will occur whenever the _ temperature _ gradient is inverted , due to the _ magneto - thermal instability _ , ( mti ; see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the first numerical studies of this instability ) .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of the mti in the outer regions of clusters , where temperature decreases with radius , and found that the temperature profile of the icm can be substantially modified on timescales of several billion years . the instability drives field lines to become preferentially radial leading to conduction at a high fraction of the spitzer conductivity .",
    "the icm cores of cooling core galaxy clusters will be stable to the mti ( since the temperature in such cores is increasing with radius ) .",
    "however , @xcite has discovered a related instability ( the _ heat flux buoyancy instability _ ; hbi ) which acts when the temperature is increasing with radius . based on local simulations of the hbi in 3d stratified atmosphere , @xcite found the hbi induces mhd turbulence and can somewhat amplify the magnetic field in the plasma .",
    "they also discovered that , in the plane - parallel geometry that characterizes all local simulations , the instability saturates when the lines of magnetic field are re - oriented in such a way as to suppress the heat transport across the temperature gradient .",
    "guided by the results from the local simulations , @xcite suggested that mhd turbulence driven by the hbi may be important in regulating the conduction of heat into icm cores and could mediate the stabilization of the cooling cores .",
    "they hypothesized that the presence of radiative cooling and the spherical ( as opposed to planar ) geometry would prevent field line re - orientation from completely insulating the core from the conductive heat flux .",
    "they also highlighted the fact that hbi driven turbulence would create a convective heat flux that _ removes _ heat from the cool core ( i.e. , it acts as a cooling term in the energy equation ) .    in this paper",
    ", we present global models of cooling core clusters in which we explore the role of heat conduction and the hbi on the evolution of these cores .",
    "the results of our simulations suggest that hbi alone can not regulate and stabilize a cooling core .",
    "we have followed the non - linear evolution of the hbi in the inner @xmath3  kpc in clusters , and found that it is ubiquitous and rearranges the lines of magnetic field in such a way that they are wrapped around the core .",
    "this results in dramatic suppression of the heat conduction below the spitzer value .",
    "consequently , within context of these simple models ( which do not include agn or realistic cluster / dark matter dynamics ) heat conduction can significantly delay but can not prevent the catastrophic core collapse in real clusters . in ",
    "2 we briefly review the equations and time scales governing the problem of heat conduction in cluster cores as well as the numerical setup used in simulations . in ",
    "3 we present results from a parameter space study of cooling core clusters and then focus on a specific model of a core resembling that in the perseus cluster .",
    "we discuss our results , approximations , and observational consequences in   4 , and present our conclusions in ",
    "using the 3-dimensional mhd code _ athena _",
    "@xcite , we have carried out simulations of thermally conducting icm cores which incorporate the effects of anisotropic thermal conduction .",
    "we run two classes of simulations .",
    "firstly , we conduct a suite of simulations aimed at mapping out the behavior of clusters as a function of position in the 2-dimensional parameter space @xmath4 , where the cooling timescale @xmath5 , conduction timescale @xmath6 , and dynamical timescale @xmath7 are defined in section  [ s_timescales ] .",
    "these simulations describe `` theorist clusters '' in the sense that no particular physical parameters ( e.g. , density , temperature and timescales ) are implied , with only dimensionless ratios being relevant .",
    "we shall refer to these as our `` parameter space survey simulations '' .",
    "secondly , we shall conduct simulations that are specifically tailored to describe physically - realistic clusters . we shall refer to these as our `` physical clusters / simulations '' .",
    "we must note one peculiarity of these ( or indeed any ) simulations of `` idealized '' galaxy clusters . in removing our model clusters from their cosmological setting ,",
    "the computational complexity of the problem is reduced enormously . indeed",
    ", it is currently infeasible to perform a cosmological simulation which resolves the small scale physics relevant to our study .",
    "however , it is important to realize that galaxy clusters are dynamically young objects and , through the accretion of subclusters and groups , are still in the process of forming .",
    "any _ ab initio _ model for the thermodynamic state of the icm _ must _ acknowledge the cosmological setting . neglecting the cosmological setting has two consequences for our work .",
    "firstly , real systems will possess dynamics related to merging substructures that is not captured in our treatment .",
    "the effects of neglecting this phenomenon will be discussed in section  4 .",
    "secondly , there is no well - defined choice of `` physical initial conditions '' for our model clusters",
    ". we must be content with forming well defined initial conditions that describe gross aspects of the systems under consideration .",
    "we describe our choice of initial conditions below .",

    "( 2009 ) who employ a rather different choice of initial condition suggests a robustness to these choices .",

    "we have ignored viscous terms in the equation of motion in this work ; these will be considered in a future study .    in the absence of magnetic fields ,",

    "will then be given by @xmath23 .",
    "if such efficient conduction operated unimpeded , radiative loses within massive icm cores would be more than balanced by the conduction of heat from the outer portions of the icm in all but the lowest mass clusters .",
    "this would eliminate the possibility of a cooling flow or , indeed , any significant departure from isothermality @xcite .",
    "however , magnetic fields of any plausible astrophysical strength will strongly suppress transport of electrons across their line of force .",
    "thermal conduction is expected to be efficient along field lines , and suppressed perpendicular to the field lines .",
    "the form of the heat flux under these conditions is , @xmath24 where @xmath25 is a unit vector in the direction of the magnetic field . assuming a spherical temperature gradient , the radial heat flux can be expressed as @xmath26 . for convenience we will define a thermal diffusivity , @xmath27 , where @xmath28 has dimensions of a diffusion coefficient ( @xmath29 ) , and @xmath30 and @xmath31 are fiducial values for the electron number density and temperature , respectively .",
    "anisotropic thermal conduction is implemented in the _ athena _ code via a split operator approach with subcycling @xcite .",
    "subcycling ensures stability of the integration and is used whenever the courant time step for conduction falls below that used for hydrodynamic equations .",

    "we adopt two forms for the optically - thin radiative cooling function ; both are introduced into the _ athena _ code using operator splitting as explicit source terms .",
    "the majority of our parameter space survey simulations employ a very simple `` bremsstrahlung '' form for the cooling function , @xmath36 .",
    "we control the strength of radiative cooling and hence the cooling timescale via the parameter @xmath37 . on the other hand ,",

    "the simplicity of an isothermal hydrostatic atmosphere makes it a compelling choice of initial condition .",
    "however , the astrophysical systems of interest have icm cores that display a positive temperature gradient .",
    "furthermore , the interesting dynamics is driven by temperature gradients .",
    "thus we employ a pre - cursor simulation where , starting from the isothermal state , we create a cool core in the atmosphere by allowing radiative cooling in the absence of conduction .",
    "this continues until the core reaches a temperature of @xmath62 , similar to the range observed in cores .",

    "the components of energy density are normalized to the internal energy density of the gas and , hence , the kinetic and magnetic energy represent a small fraction ( @xmath132 ) of the internal energy .",

    "border line cases represent the transition population between the collapse and isothermal group of objects and their final state is determined by the structure of magnetic field .",
    "the behavior of borderline cases is illustrated by comparing models t3b2 and a6b2 ( which differ only in their initial field structure ) , where the former evolves to isothermal state in @xmath158 and the latter collapses after @xmath159 .",

    "the cause of different outcomes in these two models is probably stochastic , driven by a slightly different evolution of the magnetic field and it underlines the role of the field structure in these transition population of objects .",
    "the values of @xmath116 for tn , b2 , and b4 border line cases are 26 , 38 and 75 , respectively .",
    "we also find that cores with @xmath161 evolve towards collapse regardless of their initial field geometry ( t2 , a6 , and ar10 in case of both b3 and b4 runs but also t2b2 and a5b2 ) , while those with @xmath162 all evolve towards isothermal state ( t3b3 , a7b3 , and ar11b3 ) .      in order to offer a more intuitive interpretation of the role of hbi for a portion of the parameter space populated by real clusters , we present a second group of calculations where we scale simulation parameters specifically to match the cooling core of a rich galaxy cluster .",

    ", the ( anisotropic ) heat conduction is set to the spitzer value ( equation  [ eq5 ] ) and mediated by magnetic field in all models .",

    "the collapse of conducting cores is postponed by a factor of @xmath178 with respect to the time scale for pure radiative collapse .",
    "the cores in models p1 and p2 evolve through an initial heating of the core during which time the hbi re - orients the field lines in order to reduce the conductive heat flux . figures  [ perseus_temp ] and [ perseus_thetab ] show the evolution of the core temperature and @xmath179 in p1- and p2-models along with the pure radiative collapse case , for comparison .",

    "the cores in p1 and p2 models evolve through the initial rise in temperature , have a phase of uniform evolution approximately linear with time , and in the final 2  gyr dominated by radiative cooling behave similarly to the pure radiative collapse case .",
    "as remarked in the previous section , the initial rise in the core temperature in models with heat conduction is a consequence of non - equilibrium initial conditions . the intermediate phase of steady , quasi - linear decay of the core temperature is specific to conducting cores and is absent in case of pure collapse model .",
    "the presence of hbi is indicated by the high value of @xmath182 shown in the left panel of figure  [ perseus_thetab ] , contrary to the pure radiative collapse scenario p5 ( right panel ) which does not maintain the azimuthal structure of the field .",
    "the field line re - orientation appears to saturate at @xmath183 and , from then on , the core undergoes a gradual decline in core temperature until it reaches a temperature of @xmath184kev . after that time",
    ", the core temperature decreases more rapidly due to the onset of line - cooling within the tn cooling function and the cooling catastrophe is reached @xmath185gyr later . indeed , this final stage in the conducting core models is very similar to the pure radiative collapse case , conduction having very little effect .    if real cluster cores are similar to the cores modeled here , they are likely to be observed precisely during the long gradual decline phase ( although , compared with model clusters during this phase , real clusters have a larger fractional temperature decrease as one heads into the core ) . in model - p1 , this phase starts from 1  gyr after the beginning of the simulation ( at which time the core has a temperature of 5kev ) and the core collapses 8  gyr later . in model p2 , the life time of the core is extended due to the presence of a split monopole , with collapse occurring 9.5gyr after the start of this decline phase .",
    "a pure cooling simulation starting from a temperature of 5kev undergoes the cooling catastrophe in approximately 4gyr .",
    "thus , even starting off with rather azimuthal field geometries , thermal conduction delays the thermal collapse of the cluster core by at least a factor of 2 .",
    "it follows from the findings in previous section that the longest lived cooling cores are those with large scale magnetic fields ( represented by t - models ) . in order to estimate the factor by which core collapse is postponed in these models , we consult our grid of models outlined in table  [ table1 ] and [ table2 ] .",
    "it is possible to infer that t - model cores collapse on time scales @xmath186 times longer with respect to the cores with predominantly azimuthal fields ( a - models ) , as illustrated in examples of model pairs : t2b2  a5b2 , t2b3  a6b3 , and",
    "t2b4  a6b4 .",
    "hence , if t - model cores evolve @xmath186 times longer than a - model cores , and perseus - like a - model cores evolve on time scales @xmath187 , than the overall evolution of collapsing cores can be prolonged by a total factor of @xmath188 .",
    ", scaledwidth=48.0% ]         , scaledwidth=48.0% ]    as found in sections  [ s_isothermal][s_collapse ] , these model clusters cores are characterized by an absence of strong turbulence or a magnetic dynamo effect .",
    "the magnetic and kinetic energies uniformly decrease in p1 and p2 models ( figure  [ perseus_energies ] ) and are only a small fraction of @xmath189 of the internal energy .",
    "figure  [ perseus_velocities ] shows the distribution of velocity magnitude in the xy - plane containing the core center .",
    "the highest velocities in the core are of the order of @xmath190 and are visibly associated with the magnetic field structure . as the relative strength of magnetic field decreases in the process of core collapse , the core center becomes kinematically more quiescent with respect to the initial velocity distribution .",
    "modeled perseus - like cores exhibit the strongest heat conduction and heat flux buoyancy instability within the radius of @xmath191  kpc  a distance comparable to the half - depth radius of the core where the temperature gradient is steepest .",
    "figure  [ lumin_perseus ] shows the evolution of five luminosity components in units of @xmath192 calculated for a sphere of radius of 20  kpc in model p1 .",
    "note that during the first @xmath193  gyr of evolution , anisotropic heat conduction overcompensates for the radiative losses and that this phase is coincident with the initial rapid rise of the core temperature seen in figure  [ perseus_temp ] . between 1 and 7.5  gyr radiative losses",
    "are comparable to but larger than the rate of heat conduction and in this period core temperature steadily declines . in the remaining period of evolution ,",
    "the rate of radiative cooling becomes @xmath194 times larger than the anisotropic heat conduction and the core evolves towards collapse in the fashion similar to a pure radiative collapse scenario .",
    "the rate of energy transported by convection is consistently @xmath195 orders of magnitude lower than that of the anisotropic conduction and it acts as a cooling term throughout the simulation .",
    "also included in figure  [ lumin_perseus ] is the fiducial rate of unbridled heat conduction at the spitzer value ( thick , long dash line ) , plotted for comparison  because this component of luminosity is significantly larger than the others , we divided it by a factor of 10 in order to show it in the same plot .",
    "models p1 , p3 and p4 constitute a crude numerical resolution study for these models . in order to characterize the effect of numerical resolution on our results we choose the run p1 with numerical resolution of @xmath53 as a baseline model . with tangled azimuthal field structure and characteristic coherence lengths of @xmath83 and @xmath196 this run is a good choice for resolution study , because the resolution effects are potentially more severe than in the runs with large scale , loosely tangled field .",
    "we carried out calculations equivalent to p1 , at higher resolution of @xmath197 ( run p3 ) and lower resolution of @xmath198 ( run p4 ) .",
    "interestingly , we find that stepping up the numerical resolution leads to a non - monotonic evolution of the collapse timescale ( fig .",
    "[ perseus_resolution ] ) .",
    "this behavior can be explained by the effect of resolution on magnetic field orientation ( right panel of fig .",
    "[ perseus_resolution ] ) .",
    "higher resolution captures the finer , radial structure of tangled field lines in addition to the dominant azimuthal component , resulting in the lower initial value of @xmath179 .",
    "this results in a highest rate of heat conduction in model p3 ( 0.04 , 0.054 , and 0.01 of the spitzer value for p1 , p3 , and p4 , respectively ) and a more rapid reorientation of the field lines due to hbi when compared to moderate - resolution model p1 .",
    "the consequence of rapid hbi evolution in model core p3 is that it also collapses before the core in p1 . on the other hand ,",
    "heat conduction in model p4 is initially at such a low level that its evolution proceeds fairly similar to a pure radiative collapse and thus , occurs on a shorter time scale that in models p1 and p3 .",
    "progressing from the simulation with @xmath198 resolution towards the higher end , the discrepancy in overall evolution time of the core decreases from @xmath195  gyr to @xmath193  gyr , indicating convergence . based on this we estimate that core evolution in most affected models in our calculations",
    "can be prolonged by @xmath193  gyr .",
    "heat conduction is in principle capable of providing a large fraction of the energy necessary to prevent the core collapse in clusters of galaxies  indeed , the potential importance of conduction has been discussed ever since the realization that thermal collapse was a problem for icm atmospheres ( binney & cowie 1981 ) .",
    "however , attempts to solve the cooling flow problem with thermal conduction face several challenges .",
    "because of a steep temperature dependence of spitzer conductivity , heat conduction is expected to play a lesser role in low mass clusters and groups of galaxies , where most of the gas is below 5kev @xcite .",
    "even unbridled spitzer thermal conduction can not offset radiative loses in these low - mass systems .",
    "hence , heat conduction can not be a single solution to the cooling flow problem across the full range of masses , and additional sources of heat are needed to stabilize cooling flows in at least these lower mass systems .",
    "even in hot systems where conduction is potent , previous studies have highlighted fine - tuning problems @xcite . under the assumption that a tangled magnetic field essentially acts as a scalar suppression factor for isotropic conduction , and that the suppression factor @xmath199 is a fixed parameter , @xcite show that @xmath199 must be fine - tuned in order to obtain a thermal quasi - equilibrium resembling real cooling core clusters .",
    "even then , this equilibrium is unstable with a growth time @xmath200  gyr .",
    "our results indicate that presence of the hbi even further undermines the role of heat conduction because of its tendency to stifle conduction by rearranging the lines of magnetic field to be orthogonal to the temperature gradient .",
    "we find that only systems with a large disparity in characteristic time scales , @xmath201 , can avoid the cooling catastrophe by evolving to isothermal state .",
    "systems reminiscent of real clusters , with @xmath202 evolve towards thermal collapse on time scales @xmath203 . for many cooling core clusters ( such as perseus )",
    "this is significantly shorter than a hubble time , hence rendering heat conduction alone incapable of rescuing the core from collapse .",
    "that said , we do find that conduction can significantly increase the time to thermal collapse , i.e. , a significant energy is conducted into the core before the field - line re - orientation by the hbi seals it off and enables it to collapse . at this point , we must acknowledge the missing ingredients in our idealized cluster models .",
    "a quiescent cluster core can be significantly disturbed by cosmologically - induced dynamics ( e.g. sub - cluster mergers ) and/or powerful outbursts from a central agn .",
    "either of these events will disrupt the azimuthal nature of the field and may partially reset the evolution being described by our models .",
    "thus , while thermal conduction seems unable to stabilize cooling cores alone , it may still be the primary agent heating cluster cores provided that it is _ enabled _ by subcluster mergers or agn .",
    "note that this is a very different role than that normally envisaged for agn in cooling cluster clusters ; if correct , _ agn are stirrers and not heaters .",
    "_    an interesting property of our models is the absence of strong turbulent motions . with plasma motions at @xmath204 modeled collapsing cores",
    "are kinematically quiescent in comparison with realistic cores , which exhibit turbulent velocities in the range @xmath205 over comparable spatial scales @xcite .",
    "this highlights the necessary role of the central agn and cluster mergers as stirrers of the intercluster plasma .",
    "both observational and theoretical studies of the cooling problem have established that the mechanism responsible for the stability of cooling cores has to be gentle , spatially distributed , and physically reminiscent of diffusion @xcite .",
    "this is an intrinsic property of heat conduction but is more difficult to understand in pure agn heating scenarios .",
    "for example , simple shock heating by agn jets fails to stabilize cooling flows in pure hydrodynamic simulations @xcite unless a high degree of turbulent heat diffusion is postulated @xcite .",
    "in addition , @xcite find that the entropy of the gas in cooling cores is surprisingly low  at 10s of @xmath206 the gas is on a brink of catastrophic collapse and yet maintained in that state over a large fraction of the hubble time .",
    "this presents a challenge for any mechanism which would heat the gas via strong turbulent motions or shocks , as it is expected to result in a much higher value of entropy than that observed .",
    "the implication of this discovery is that an unusually delicately balanced feedback mechanism operates in cooling cores and that heat conduction in combination with additional mechanisms may play an important role .",
    "another implication of the ubiquity of hbi is that clusters with cool cores may exhibit a characteristic magnetic field structure , where field lines are wrapped around the core and have predominantly azimuthal structure .",
    "although our model clusters never completely forget about their initial magnetic field ( i.e. , t - models and a - models can be recognized even at late time ) , the wrapping of field lines into spherical shells is ubiquitous .",
    "the instability drives the field lines to almost orthogonal position with respect to the temperature gradient , @xmath207 .",
    "this has several consequences .",
    "firstly , it creates exactly the kind of magnetic field geometry envisaged in models of agn blown bubbles that invoke `` magnetic draping '' ( ruszkowski et al .",
    "2007 ) . in these models , a bubble of relativistic plasma which is buoyantly rising in the icm atmosphere",
    "is stabilized to rayleigh - taylor and kelvin - helmholtz instabilities by a layer of strong magnetic field that has been swept up on its leading edge .",
    "it is suggested that this mechanism is responsible for the surprising stability of `` ghost cavities '' in the icm of the perseus cluster , and is an alternative to models that invoke plasma viscosity ( reynolds et al . 2005 ) .",
    "secondly , this characteristic field line geometry leads to the most direct observable predictions / manifestations of the hbi in the icm .",
    "magnetic fields in the ambient icm can be probed via the rotation measure ( rm ) of polarized radio sources in the background .",
    "the rm is an integral measurement of the effect that magnetic fields impart on the orientation of the plane of an electromagnetic wave traveling through the plasma .",
    "hence , an azimuthal field structure would produce a characteristic radial dependence in the observed rm : it would vanish at the projected cluster center , and peak at some projected radius within the cooling core .",
    "we calculate this effect for our perseus - like models using the expression rm@xmath208 , where @xmath17 is the electron number density in units of @xmath209 , @xmath11 is the vector of magnetic field in units of @xmath210 , and * l * is the depth of the magnetic screen in kiloparsecs .",
    "figure  [ rm ] shows an illustrative calculation of the rm for model - p2 .",
    "we find that in perseus - like models the magnetic field with mean strength of @xmath211 produces rm of order @xmath212 .",
    "the hbi - wrapped field also produces a characteristic spatial structure to the rm map .",
    "future observatories with the radio instruments such as _ square kilometer array",
    "_ should provide the sensitivity needed to identify and study background sources with sufficient areal density to map out these rm patterns .",
    "note however that our calculation accounts for the rm arising from the core of a cluster but does not take into account the effect of magnetic structures and plasma in the outer parts of a cluster .",
    "therefore , if the cluster field strength is dominated by the the magnetic fields in the core , this effect may be measurable .",
    "we have performed simulations of cooling cores in clusters of galaxies with the aim to study the role of anisotropic heat conduction and recently discovered hbi on the thermodynamic evolution of cores .",
    "our models focus on the base state of cluster cores and do not take into account physics of the central agn or dark matter or icm substructure resulting from hierarchical merging of subcluster units .",
    "we explore the parameter space of cooling and conduction timescales as well as different magnetic field configurations .",
    "we summarize our most important results here :    * the parameter space of modeled systems can be divided into three distinct groups of models where collapsing cores occupy the parameter range @xmath213 and isothermal cores exhibit @xmath214 .",
    "the range between these two groups is occupied by a class of systems which final state is determined by the configuration of magnetic field lines . * the efficiency of heat conduction along the lines of magnetic field ranges between @xmath215 of the spitzer value , depending on the initial structure of magnetic field and evolutionary stage of the core . *",
    "modeled conducting cores that correspond to real clusters , exhibit evolution towards core collapse slower by a factor of @xmath216 with respect to the time scale for a pure radiative collapse . for many cooling core clusters ( such as perseus )",
    "this is significantly shorter than a hubble time , implying that heat conduction alone can not rescue the core from collapse .",
    "the extent to which core collapse is postponed in our models is a function of the initial magnetic field topology , where systems with higher values of @xmath217 ratio and field configurations amenable to conduction result in longer collapse time scales . * magnetic field lines in cores in which hbi is actively operating rearrange themselves in such way that final value of @xmath218 .",
    "in contrast , cores that are not characterized by hbi have @xmath129 .",
    "if seen in observations , the alignment of field lines across the global temperature gradient would provide a strong evidence for existence of mhd instabilities in clusters , which have so far only been considered theoretically .",
    "* heat flux buoyancy instability operating in modeled cores is not characterized by a strong turbulence and results in kinematically quiescent cores .",
    "a related consequence of this property is that mhd turbulence driven by the heat flux instability does not drive a convective thermal flux sufficient to regulate the core collapse .",
    "this finding is interesting in light of observational and theoretical studies of the cooling problem which have established that the mechanism responsible for the stability of cooling cores has to be gentle and spatially distributed in order to agree with the low levels of entropy observed in some cooling cores and implies that heat conduction in combination with additional mechanisms may play an important role for the cooling problem .",
    "the prospects for future work are numerous and they stem from the need to design more realistic models of cooling cores and also to understand the interplay of mhd instabilities with other mechanisms operating in clusters .",
    "future studies will be needed to address the evolution of cool core clusters within the cosmological framework and consider the effects of minor and major mergers on gas mixing , kinematically and mhd driven turbulence , field line tangling , agn fueling , and the overall thermodynamic state of a cluster . on the other hand they will also need to disentangle the effects of plasma transport processes and magnetic fields via simulations that incorporate full mhd as well as viscosity , thermal conduction , and cosmic ray diffusion .",
