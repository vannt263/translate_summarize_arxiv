    "x - ray observations have shown that the radiative cooling time of the icm ( intracluster medium ) in the central regions of galaxy clusters ( cool cores ) is generally smaller than the hubble time . if there were no heating sources , the icm flows subsonically toward the cluster center with a mass deposition rate of @xmath1@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this flow had been called a cooling flow. however , recent x - ray observations have shown that the actual cooling rate of the icm is much smaller .",
    "the japanese _ asca _",
    "( advanced satellite for cosmology and astrophysics ) team indicated that metal emission lines from the low temperature cooling gas were much weaker than had been predicted by the classical cooling flow model @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by _ xmm - newton _ @xcite ; the actual mass deposition rate is at least 5 or 10 times less than that previously assumed .",
    "the lack of the cooling flows indicates that there are heating sources in the central regions of clusters that prevent the development of cooling flows .",
    "most popular candidate of the heating source is agns at the centers of clusters .",
    "however , although the energy released by the agns is sufficient to cancel radiative cooling of the icm in cool cores , the mechanism of energy transfer from the agns to the surrounding icm is not clear .",
    "one possible mechanism is the dissipation of sound waves and weak shocks that have evolved from sound waves @xcite .",
    "those waves could be generated by the activities of the central agns of clusters .",
    "in fact , sound waves and weak shocks are observed in the central regions of the perseus and the virgo clusters @xcite .",
    "however , it has been shown that sound waves ( longitudinal waves ) and weak shocks that have evolved from the sound waves can not stably heat a cool core , because they should dissipate before they propagate in the whole core .",
    "in other words , their dissipation length is too small .",
    "even if their net energy is large enough to balance radiative cooling , the temperature profile of a cluster soon becomes irregular , which is not consistent with observations @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it seems to be curious that structures that look like sound waves ( ripples ) have been observed far away ( @xmath3  kpc ) from the central agn in the perseus cluster @xcite . since the dissipation length of the waves is small , the density fluctuations or the ripples",
    "should not be observed there if they were created at the cluster center .",
    "so far , only longitudinal waves have been considered as heating sources in clusters . however , since the icm is magnetized ( @xmath4@xmath5 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there should be magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) waves including tranverse waves .",
    "it has been known that transverse waves ( alfvn waves ) can propagate a longer distance than longitudinal waves ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "thus , the transverse waves could heat the whole core . in this letter",
    ", we consider the heating by tranverse waves and longitudinal waves that are a by - product of nonlinear evolution of the transverse waves .",
    "the longitudinal waves could be observed as the ripples .",
    "we do not restrict the wave generators only to agns , because a long wave period is required to reproduce the ripples as shown below .",
    "it is to be noted that @xcite proposed a heating model of mhd effects , but they considered magnetic reconnection instead of waves .",
    "the models presented here are based on heating models of the solar corona @xcite .",
    "we study the propagation of waves along a magnetic field line extending from the cluster center in the radial direction .",
    "we assume axisymmetry about this field line . in the vicinity of the line",
    ", we consider a local orthogonal curvilinear coordinate system defined by @xmath6 , the distance from the cluster center , by the azimuthal angle @xmath7 measured about the axis of symmetry , and by @xmath8 measured in the direction perpendicular to both @xmath6 and @xmath7 vectors @xcite . in the following , the indices , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 , indicate the vector components for each direction .",

    "longitudinal waves are not injected for simplicity .",
    "it is to be noted that even if we give longitudinal waves with the same acceleration as that of the transverse waves , the resultant gas velocity of the longitudinal waves ( @xmath45 ) is much smaller than that of the transverse waves ( @xmath46 ) .",

    "all of the calculations presented in this letter use cans ( coordinated astronomical numerical software ) .",
    "the number of grid points is 16392 .",
    "the grid size is 8.3  pc for @xmath64  kpc and it increases logarithmically for @xmath65  kpc .",
    "first , we investigate the case where waves are not injected for comparison ( a genuine cooling flow ) . fig .",
    "[ fig : cf ] shows the evolution of temperature and electron number density as functions of distance from the cluster center .",
    "the interval of the lines is 0.8  gyr . because of radiative cooling",
    ", the temperature decreases and the density increases monotonically at the cluster center .",
    "next , we consider the heating by alfvn waves by injecting transverse waves at the inner boundary . we take @xmath66 and @xmath67  gyr .",
    "for this wave period @xmath44 , the wave length of the sound waves is @xmath68  kpc . on the other hand ,",
    "the wave length of the alfvn waves is smaller and is @xmath69  kpc at @xmath7050  kpc , which is comparable to the observed wave length of ripples @xcite",
    ". this wave period may be too large to be attributed to the activities of the central agn ; it could be attributed to gas motion around the central galaxy induced by minor cluster mergers such as sloshing @xcite or tsunami @xcite .",
    "the wave injection in a form of acceleration ( eq .  [ [ eq : acc ] ] ) would be preferable to model the waves of this kind , because the acceleration is independent of the gas flow toward the cluster center and the agn .",
    "the transverse waves would be generated on the side of the sloshing central galaxy , but not in front and in the rear .",
    "[ fig : tero_a1 ] shows the evolution of the temperature and density profiles when transverse waves are considered .",
    "we found that while the temperature at the cluster center decreases for @xmath71  gyr , it is stable and almost constant for @xmath72  gyr until we stopped the calculation at @xmath73  gyr . since we inject waves in a form of acceleration irrelevant of the gas mass of the core , the wave energy increases as the gas density in the core and thus the gas mass of the core increases",
    "this is because for a given acceleration , the heavier the gas core is , the larger kinetic energy is given to the gas core .",
    "this is one reason that the temperature stops decreasing .",
    "the wave energy flux per unit area is given by @xmath74 . at @xmath75  kpc ( outside the wave injection region ) , the energy flux is @xmath76 at @xmath77 , and it increases to @xmath78 at @xmath79  gyr .",
    "numerical simulations showed that the energy can be supplied by minor cluster mergers @xcite .",
    "[ fig : vxvy_a1 ] shows the longitudinal and transverse velocity profiles at @xmath80 and 3.2  gyr .",
    "the transverse waves have reached @xmath81  kpc at @xmath80  gyr and @xmath82  kpc at @xmath83  gyr . in fig .",
    "[ fig : vxvy_a1]b , sharp jumps are seen ; these jumps are formed through the steeping of alfvn waves and are called switch - on shocks ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "at these shocks , while entropy is generated , longitudinal waves are also generated through nonlinear coupling ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the longitudinal waves ( sound waves ) soon steepen and turn into weak shocks ( n - waves ; fig .",
    "[ fig : vxvy_a1]a ) , which also contribute to the heating of the icm . note that @xmath45 is much smaller than @xmath46 .",
    "contrary to the transverse waves , the longitudinal waves can be observed in temperature and density profiles . the temperature and density fluctuations seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tero_a1 ] reflect the generation of the longitudinal waves .",
    "in particular , the density fluctuations could be observed as ripples .",
    "since these longitudinal waves are generated away from the cluster center , they can be observed even at @xmath84  kpc ( fig .",
    "[ fig : tero_a1]b ) .",
    "we also studied the mass inflow rate at the inner boundary . in the cooling flow case ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cf ] ) , the inflow rate at @xmath85  gyr is @xmath86 , and it is @xmath87 at @xmath73  gyr . on the other hand , waves can decrease the inflow rate significantly . in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : tero_a1 ] , it is @xmath88 at @xmath89  gyr , which means that the waves effectively heat the surrounding icm , although they can not completely shut down a cooling flow .",
    "the inflow rate gradually increases , but even at @xmath90  gyr , it is still @xmath91 .",
    "we found that the heating by the alfvn waves is fairly stable even if we change the acceleration parameter @xmath43 , because as we mentioned above , high density coming from radiative cooling results in a high heating rate , and vice versa .",

    "[ fig : tero_a1]a ) , the heating balances cooling after @xmath95  gyr",
    ". however , if @xmath43 is much smaller than one , the waves can not prevent the development of a cooling flow . in summary ,",
    "@xmath43 must be tuned to be @xmath962 in order to reproduce observed temperature profiles .",
    "moreover , we have investigated the heating by alfvn waves with a relatively small wave period ( @xmath97  yr ) , which would be appropriate for waves generated by the activities of the central agn .",
    "we found that the heating by these waves is not stable .",
    "the reason is similar to the heating by sound waves alone , that is , the waves can heat only the innermost region of the cluster .",
    "we have shown that alfvn waves ( transverse waves ) with a long wave period can effectively heat cool cores of galaxy clusters .",
    "since the dissipation rate of the waves is small , the waves can reach the outer core and then heat the whole core before they dissipate . during the propagation",
    ", sound waves ( longitudinal waves ) are generated through nonlinear coupling , and they would be observed as ripples . the long dissipation length indicates the superiority of the heating by the alfvn waves over that by sound waves alone . in real clusters , however , it would be possible that sound waves created by agn activities heat the inner cores , while alfvn waves induced by cluster mergers heat the outer cores . in this case",
    ", the wave acceleration ( @xmath98 ) required to heat the cores will be much smaller than that we assumed .",
    "we assumed that the alfvn waves are generated close to the cluster center ( @xmath9910  kpc ) .",
    "@xcite showed that complex gas motion should be created even at the cluster center by minor cluster mergers .",
    "thus , our assumption may be justified . however , if the waves are generated at some distance from the center , another heating source is required to heat the center .    in this letter , we considered only spherically symmetric magnetic fields .",
    "if they are not spherically symmetric , the heating should spatially be biased . in the region with stronger magnetic fields ,",
    "alfvn waves propagate faster and the heating is more effective .",
    "this could result in multiphase gas observed in the perseus cluster @xcite .",
    "if the longevity of optical filaments observed in the perseus cluster @xcite is smaller than the wave period , the filaments would indicate the direction of the wave oscillation or the motion of the central galaxy relative to the surrounding icm .",
    "that is , the waves would be propagating in the direction perpendicular to the optical filaments .",
