    "in this paper we analyse the dynamics of quantum wave packets produced by coherent excitation of atomic fine - structure manifolds in laser photodetachment experiments , and probed by multiphoton ionization .",
    "we show that for atoms with @xmath1 ground state the corresponding signal has a very specific shape , which we determine analytically and find to be in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the development of laser pulses of few - femtosecond duration allows one to resolve the electron motion in valence shells of atoms and molecules in the time domain ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently 100  fs pulse pump - probe experiments @xcite were carried out to investigate the dynamics induced by the spin - orbit interaction in neutral atoms . in these experiments",
    "c , si and ge atoms with outer @xmath2 configuration were prepared in the @xmath3 ground state by photodetachment of the respective half - filled valence shell negative ions ( @xmath4 ) by a linearly polarized pump pulse . upon interaction with the infrared laser pulse , the emission of @xmath5 electrons with orbital angular momentum projection @xmath6 is strongly favoured in comparison to @xmath7 .",
    "this causes the formation of a state with an electron density hole localized along the pump laser polarization axis and constitutes the orbital alignment effect .",
    "such a state is not an eigenstate of the atomic hamiltonian when the spin - orbit interaction is included , but a superposition of the fine - structure levels @xmath8 , which evolves in time according to the energy splittings in this manifold .",
    "this means that even for a light atom , such as c , the relativistic spin - orbit interaction is essential in determining the electron dynamics following the pump pulse . in refs .",
    "@xcite this effect was probed by applying a time - delayed ionizing probe pulse and measuring the signal of ionized electrons for parallel and perpendicular polarization of the pump and probe pulses , as a function of the time delay .",
    "the experimental findings demonstrated the dependence of the ionization yield on the time - varying hole density and the presence of quantum beat oscillations of the signal with the delay time for c and si ( with no distinct signal for ge ) .",
    "this showed that electron dynamics resulting from the spin - orbit interaction could be observed for both lighter and heavier atoms . in a recent paper @xcite rey and van der hart used @xmath9-matrix theory with time dependence ( rmt ) to model the experiment of refs .",
    "@xcite . they calculated the electron spectra following ionization of carbon in the initial orbitally - aligned states with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath10 and 1 , and observed significant differences between these two cases , matching the experimental findings .",
    "they also considered the evolution of the fine - structure - state wave packet with the pump - probe delay time and simulated the experimental signal by integrating electron emission within the cone of 11.7 degrees around the polarization direction of the probe pulse with momenta @xmath11  a.u . the scaled normalized yield obtained in this way",
    "was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data from ref .",

    "@xcite ) that removal of @xmath6 electrons dominates both the photodetachment ( pump ) and subsequent photoionization ( probe ) , and consider the motion of the @xmath1 fine - structure wave packet in c , si , or ge . this gives a simple analytical expression for the signal as a function of the pump - probe time delay . in order to make comparisons with experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite we scale the signal to account for the background counts that could be present under the experimental conditions .",
    "this allows us to analyse the contribution of background to the observed signal beats and to effectively describe the loss of coherence in the wave packets for systems with short beat periods .",

    "we assume that after an instantaneous photodetachment of an electron with @xmath6 , the atoms are produced in a @xmath1 state at zero time delay , after which this state evolves according to the energy splittings of the fine - structure manifold .",
    "the initial state of the atom is described by its total orbital and spin angular momentum quantum numbers @xmath17 and @xmath18 with projections @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively , which we denote by @xmath21 ( or a superposition of such states , see below ) . in the @xmath22-coupling scheme ,",

    "the removal of an @xmath6 electron from the initial @xmath35 anion state produces the atomic state @xmath36 .",
    "the subsequent time evolution of the atomic wave packet is found by applying eq .",
    "( [ eq : evolve ] ) and evaluating the appropriate clebsch - gordan coefficients , @xmath37 the corresponding ionization signal after the probe pulse is proportional to the probability of finding an @xmath6 electron in the state ( [ eq : evolve1 ] ) , @xmath38 for the parallel and perpendicular polarization of the probe , respectively .",
    "here @xmath39 , and the explicit forms of the atomic states given in the appendix were used .",
    "the removal of an @xmath6 electron from the initial @xmath40 anion state produces a superposition of atomic states , @xmath41 ( see the appendix ) , whose time evolution is given by @xmath42 this gives the probabilities of finding an @xmath6 electron at time @xmath43 as @xmath44 note that since the clebsch - gordan coefficient @xmath45 is zero , no interference is observed between the @xmath46 and @xmath47 sublevels .",
    "this is in agreement with the experimental analysis @xcite , which allowed for the presence of the @xmath48 beat frequency , but found its contribution statistically insignificant .",
    "note also that the sum @xmath49 , independently of time , which could be expected since there are two orthogonal directions perpendicular to the polarization of the pump pulse .",
    "the total signals for the parallel and perpendicular polarizations of the pump and probe pulses are proportional to @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",

    "( [ eq : signal ] ) does not provide a good description of the experimental data for any choice of parameters ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : ge ] ) .",
    "a related feature of the data is that the scale of the oscillations becomes very small in ge compared with c and si .",

    "the latter value is close to the size of error bars in the experimental data for ge .",
    "this behaviour is related to the effect of the pulse duration in comparison with the beat periods . in the derivation of eq .",
    "( [ eq : signal ] ) , the removal of @xmath6 electrons was assumed to be instantaneous , leading to fully coherent ( pure ) time - dependent states with wave functions ( [ eq : evolve1 ] ) and ( [ eq : evolve2 ] ) . in the experiment @xcite",
    "the duration of the pump and probe pulses was 100  fs , which is much shorter the main beat period for c and shorter than that for si , but is 2.5 times greater than @xmath94 for ge . as a result , the degree of coherence in the spin - orbit wave packet is largest for c , but becomes progressively smaller in si and ge .",
    "this results in the reduction of the coherent ( oscillatory ) part of the signal , with the atomic states produced by the pump becoming closer to a classical ensemble rather than a quantum superposition .    the spin - orbit wave packet in ge ( and to a lesser extent , in si ) is also affected by strong dependence of the multiphoton detachment rates on the threshold energy .",
    "this leads to a greater suppression of the detachment probability for higher - lying final atomic states with @xmath47 and 2 , compared with that for the @xmath46 ground state .",
    "the magnitudes of the lowest ( @xmath46 ) and highest ( @xmath95 ) thresholds are 1.2621 and 1.2675  ev in c@xmath0 , 1.3895 and 1.4172  ev in si@xmath0 , and 1.2327 and 1.4075  ev in ge@xmath0 . using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate that for a laser pulse with wavelength @xmath96  nm ( as in refs .",
    "@xcite ) and intensity @xmath97  w/@xmath98 ( for which the total detachment probability over 100  fs is close to unity ) , the increase in the threshold energy from the @xmath46 to @xmath95 state leads to 2% , 7% , and 40% reduction of the detachment rate , for c , si , and ge , respectively . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of the @xmath95 state to the wavepacket ( [ eq : jm ] ) , which is critical for the magnitude of the beats , can be reduced below the values predicted by the @xmath22-coupling coefficients .",
    "the above analysis makes it clear that a complete description of the beat character and spin - orbit coherences of the atomic ensemble requires a density matrix consideration of the problem @xcite .",
    "depending on the pump pulse length , strong - field detachment may not generally produce perfectly coherent aligned states .",
    "the elements of the density matrix in the @xmath24 basis can be determined by calculating the detachment amplitudes for a variety of pulse lengths using existing theory of strong - field photodetachment ( e.g. , keldysh - type theory @xcite ) . in this approach",
    "the diagonal elements will represent populations of different atomic fine - structure levels for a given @xmath99 , and the magnitude of the off - diagonal elements will describe coherences between the @xmath25 states .",
    "the degree of coherence is then described by the ratio of the off - diagonal elements to the geometric mean of the corresponding diagonal elements .",
    "calculations for the halogen negative ions , whose detachment leads to two fine - structure atomic states , show that the degree of coherence is a function of the ratio @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the laser pulse length @xcite .",
    "for @xmath102 the degree of coherence is close to unity , but it drops quickly for @xmath103 and reaches few - percent values for @xmath104 , which is similar to the situation in ge .",
    "we have investigated the evolution of the ground - state spin - orbit wave packets in carbon , silicon and germanium atoms produced by detachment of @xmath6 electrons from half - filled valence @xmath105 negative ions . a simple analytical formula that describes the time - changing alignment of electron orbitals , as probed in the pump - probe experiment , has been derived and applied to the analysis of experimental data @xcite . for c and si the theory provides a good description of temporal beat oscillations which demonstrate the existence of a coherent superposition of the fine - structure sublevels of the atomic triplet state . the sharp suppression of the coherence degree observed experimentally for ge demonstrates that the assumption of an instantaneous pulse is insufficient for atoms with shorter beat periods ( in the femtosecond range ) .",
    "this calls for a full density - matrix consideration of the problem that would provide a complete description of partially coherent dynamics occurring in spin - orbit manifolds of general atoms with @xmath106 valence electron orbitals .",
    "the work of s.m.k.l . has been supported by the department for employment and learning , northern ireland .",
    "we thank i. kiyan and m. eklund for providing experimental data and for useful discussions .",
    "the possible initial states of the @xmath4 negative ion are @xmath107 where each of the boxes represents a state of three electrons in the @xmath108 orbital , with magnetic quantum numbers @xmath109 , 0 , and 1 , and up ( @xmath110 ) or down ( @xmath111 ) spins . the states with @xmath112 and @xmath113 are similar and , owing to the symmetry with respect to reflection in the @xmath114-@xmath115 plane , they need not be considered .    the two - electron @xmath1 states of the neutral atom that can be formed by removal of an @xmath6 electron from the above states are @xmath116 or their superposition .",
