    "if the early universe contained significantly more luminous populations than at present , such as is thought to be the case with the very first metal - free stars ( see review by bromm & larson 2005 ) , these populations could have produced a significant contribution to the cosmic infrared background ( cib ) with potentially measurable structure ( santos et al 2002 , salvaterra & ferrara 2003 , cooray et al 2004 , kashlinsky et al 2004 ; see kashlinsky ( 2005 ) for recent review ) . in an attempt to uncover the cib fluctuations from early populations",
    "we have analyzed deep images obtained with the spitzer irac instrument ( kashlinsky , arendt , mather & moseley 2005 ; hereafter kamm1 ) , which led to detecting significant cib fluctuations remaining after subtracting sources to faint flux levels . in a companion paper we presented analysis from deeper and larger fields using the goods spitzer data ( kashlinsky , arendt , mather & moseley 2006 ; hereafter kamm2 ) , which confirms our earlier findings and extends them to fainter levels of removed galaxy populations and larger angular scales .    in this _",
    "letter _ we discuss the cosmological implications of the recent measurements of the cib fluctuations from early populations obtained by us ( kamm1,kamm2 ) .",
    "these measurements imply that the signal must come from cosmic sources which have a significant clustering component , but a low shot - noise contribution to the power spectrum .",
    "given the amplitude of the cib flux expected from these populations in the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmology ( @xmath21 2sr ) , we show that these sources must have very faint individual fluxes of @xmath310 - 20 njy in order not to exceed the measured levels of the remaining shot - noise .",
    "furthermore , these populations had to have mass - to - light ratio significantly below that of the present day stellar populations in order to produce the required cib fluxes in the short cosmic time available ( @xmath11 gyr ) from the available baryons . finally , we discuss the prospects for their individual detection with future space missions .",
    "we use the ab magnitude system , so flux per frequency @xmath4 of magnitude @xmath5 is @xmath6=@xmath7 jy ; diffuse flux in 2sr is defined as @xmath8 , with @xmath9 being the surface brightness in mjy / sr .",
    "in their analysis kamm1 and kamm2 used a total of 5 different fields with deep spitzer irac observations of up to 24 hours per pixel .",
    "all the observed fields are located at high galactic and ecliptic latitudes and are free of significant zodiacal emissions at all irac channels and of cirrus at the irac channels 1 - 3 ( 3.6 to 5.8 ) . individual galaxies and other sources",
    "were removed until a fixed level of the shot noise from remaining sources was reached .",
    "the power spectrum of the remaining diffuse emission showed a residual shot - noise component on small angles and a significant excess due to clustering of faint / distant sources at scales @xmath10 . within the errors all fields cleaned to the same shot - noise level showed the same excess fluctuations consistent with their cosmological origin ( see fig . 1 of kamm2 ) .",
    "at 8  there is a significant pollution by the galactic cirrus and at 5.8  the larger instrumental noise leads to relatively large errors in the large - scale fluctuations .",
    "here we concentrate on the interpretation of the data at 3.6 and 4.5  in terms of the luminosities , the epochs and the nature of the cosmological sources contributing to these fluctuations .",
    "kamm1 - 2 show that the cib fluctuations must come from cosmological sources , such as ordinary galaxies and the putative population iii .",
    "the former are defined as metal - rich stars with imfs of a salpeter - scalo @xcite type with masses @xmath11 .",
    "population iii is defined ( loosely ) as luminous sources that existed at , say , @xmath12 which possibly were individually very massive and intrinsically very luminous .",
    "data such as discussed here can not resolve whether the sources contributing to the cib were metal - rich @xcite and whether the source of this radiation was stellar nucleosynthesis @xcite or black - hole accretion in the early universe @xcite .",
    "population iii epochs , @xmath1310 , may contain emissions by both stars and quasar - like objects @xcite .",
    "any model aimed to explain the cib fluctuations results must reproduce three major aspects : 1 ) the sources producing the measured cib fluctuations must be fainter than those removed from the data .",
    "2 ) they must reproduce the observed excess cib fluctuations at @xmath10 , where @xmath140.07 - 0.1 2sr .",
    "3 ) lastly , the populations below the above cutoff must account not only for the correlated part of the cib , but must also reproduce the observed ( low ) shot - noise component of the signal . these lead to :    \\1 ) the the shot - noise component of the power spectrum from source counts @xmath15 per magnitude interval @xmath16 is @xmath17=@xmath18 with @xmath19=@xmath20 . to estimate limiting magnitudes implied by the measured shot - noise",
    ", we generated source counts for the observed fields with sextractor @xcite .",
    "[ fig : shot - noise ] shows the remaining shot noise levels in kamm1 - 2 analysis and the counts data .",
    "the intersection of the counts with the lowest shot noise levels shows that the sources are eliminated to @xmath2125 - 26 , so the detected cib fluctuations come from fainter sources .",
    "this magnitude limit at 3.6  corresponds to only @xmath22 emitted at 6000   at @xmath23=5 where @xmath24 is the hubble constant in units of 100 km / sec / mpc .",
    "if the counts contain extra populations in addition to those from @xcite , the magnitude limit will be fainter .",
    "thus kamm1,kamm2 have removed a significant fraction of galaxies even at @xmath23=5 and the cib fluctuations must come from sources at higher @xmath23 .",
    "\\2 ) the clustering component of the cib at @xmath25 requires @xmath26 a few 2sr as noted by us earlier @xcite .",
    "the rms fluctuation in the cib flux , @xmath27=@xmath28 , on angular scale @xmath29 is related to the underlying 3-dimensional power spectrum of the emitters clustering , @xmath30 , the duration over which the flux was produced , @xmath31 , and the rate of the cib production rate , @xmath32 , via the limber equation ( e.g. kashlinsky 2005a ) : @xmath33 ^ 2 } \\label{cib}\\ ] ] where @xmath34^{1/2}$ ] is the rms fluctuation in source counts over the cylinder of radius @xmath35 and length @xmath36 . in the limit when the cib release rate is approximately constant ,",
    "the relative cib fluctuation , @xmath37 , will be @xmath38 with @xmath39 .",
    "if @xmath32 peaks at some cosmic epoch @xmath40 , the relative fluctuation will be @xmath41 .",
    "to evaluate the range of the expected cib flux from the sources producing the measured fluctuations , we adopt the @xmath0cdm model with @xmath42=(0.3,0.044,0.7,0.71 ) and consider the epochs spanning 5@xmath4320 .",
    "the cosmic time at @xmath23=20 is @xmath440.2 gyr and the time between @xmath23=20 and @xmath23=5 is 1 gyr .",
    "the scale @xmath45=@xmath46mpc , with today s density contrast @xmath47 , subtends @xmath48(3 - 4)@xmath49 .",
    "the relative fluctuation in the projected 2-dimensional power spectrum , @xmath50 , on that angular scale @xmath51 , produced from sources located at mean value of @xmath52 and spanning the cosmic time @xmath31 , would be @xmath53 neglecting the amplification due to biasing .",
    "biasing , due to sources forming out of rare peaks of the density field , will increase @xmath50 @xcite and for reasonable bias factors ( @xmath54 for systems collapsing at @xmath555 to @xmath56 at @xmath12 ) one can gain amplification factors , @xmath57 , in @xmath50 of @xmath58 to @xmath24 - 5 between @xmath23=5 and 20 @xcite",
    ". thus the arcminute scale cib fluctuations of @xmath590.07 - 0.1 2sr at 3.6 , 4.5 require the mean cib from these sources to be @xmath60^{-1}\\rangle^{-1 } ( \\delta t/1{\\rm gyr})^{1/2}$ ] 2sr . assuming that the fluctuations are produced by low surface brightness systems at much lower @xmath23",
    "does not alter the required high value of their mean cib contribution : e.g. taking @xmath31=5gyr corresponding to the cosmic time between @xmath23=1 and 20 gives @xmath610.02 at 1@xmath49 assuming no biasing .",
    "( as discussed below such sources would likely produce shot - noise in excess of what we measure . )",
    "we can reach similar conclusions with the entire range of scales @xmath10 where we measure the clustering component of the cib .",
    "the left panels of fig . [ fig : shot - noise ] show the least squares fits for @xmath62 , assuming the @xmath0cdm model , from all the fields data at 3.6 and 4.5 .",
    "this gives @xmath63 2sr at ( 3.6,4.5 )  respectively .",
    "we thus conservatively take the fiducial flux of @xmath62=1 2sr as the minimal cib flux at 3.6 and 4.5  required by the fluctuations , corresponding to the relative minimal cib fluctuations of @xmath647% .",
    "the results below can be re - scaled to arbitrary @xmath62 , but our general conclusions will be valid unless the cib flux from sources producing the measured fluctuations is significantly _ below _ the above number .",
    "although the net cib fluxes may be , in principle , much higher , this _ minimal _ cib level at 3.6  is smaller than the claimed cib excess from dirbe and irts measurements over that from galaxy counts @xcite , and is consistent with the recent measurements of absorption in the spectra of fairly distant ( @xmath23=0.13 - 0.18 ) blazars at tev energies @xcite .",
    "such cib levels should , however , be measurable from the spectra of gamma - ray bursts at @xmath131 - 2 detectable with the upcoming nasa s glast mission out to 300 gev @xcite .",
    "spitzer counts @xcite show that the remaining ordinary galaxies can contribute only @xmath440.15 2sr at 3.6 @xcite , so to explain the cib fluctuations with the remaining ( extrapolated ) spitzer counts sources requires almost @xmath64100% fluctuation on arcminute scales .",
    "\\3 ) the cib in the populations producing the measured fluctuations significantly exceeds that from extrapolated irac counts @xcite , so the excess flux must come from fainter populations with a significant deviation from the extrapolated counts slope @xcite .",
    "the measured fluctuations indicate a population with a relatively strong clustering component , which at the same time has low shot noise .",
    "this means that the sources must be individually faint .",
    "the shot - noise from the remaining galaxies dominates the power spectrum of the cib at @xmath30.5@xmath49 and its amplitude sets an _ upper _ limit on the shot - noise component of the sources contributing to the arcminute scale cib fluctuations .",
    "the amplitude of the shot - noise component is @xcite : @xmath17=@xmath65 , where @xmath66=@xmath67 is the cib from sources at the magnitude interval @xmath16 and @xmath68 is the total flux from the remaining sources of @xmath69 .",
    "the sources contributing to the clustering component of the fluctuations at arcminute scales must not exceed the level of the residual shot noise in the data of @xmath70 nw@xmath71/m@xmath72/sr at ( 3.6 , 4.5 ) . at 4.5  this shot - noise amplitude of @xmath17=@xmath73 nw@xmath71/m@xmath72/sr or @xmath74",
    "njy@xmath752sr , would lead to sources contributing to the signal having mean fluxes less than 12 @xmath76 njy or ab magnitudes @xmath77 . at 3.6",
    "the shot - noise levels are a factor of @xmath58 larger leading to @xmath78 about one magnitude brighter .",
    "an important further information could be obtained in still deeper measurements by setting a lower limit on the shot - noise component of the sources contributing to the cib fluctuations determined when the clustering component disappears of is substantially reduced .",
    "more information on the nature of populations of these faint sources can be obtained by considering the fraction of baryons that went through stars prior to @xmath79 ( @xmath801 gyr ) needed to explain the level of the cib required by our data .",
    "the net flux at frequency @xmath4 produced by the population with comoving luminosity density @xmath81 , is @xmath82=@xmath83 , where @xmath84=@xmath85 .",
    "this requires the average comoving luminosity density at ( 0.36 - 0.45)@xmath86 of : @xmath87 for comparison the present - day luminosity density measured by the sloan digital sky survey at 0.32  to 0.68  is about an order of magnitude lower @xcite .",
    "this indicates significantly more luminous populations contributing to the cib fluctuations than at present .",
    "the contribution to the density parameter by these sources is thus given by : @xmath88 where @xmath89 is the mass - to - light ratio .",
    "for comparison the mean density in present day stars is significantly lower at @xmath90 @xcite and much of the contribution to @xmath91 comes from the late stellar population i stars with solar metallicities . strictly speaking eq .",
    "[ eq : omega_lum ] assumes no re - processing of baryons and may thus overestimate the required amount of luminous baryons in the case of short lived massive stars , such as population iii , but it shows that it is energetically easier to produce the significant cib levels implied by the spitzer data in the cosmic time available with stars whose mass - function is skewed toward @xmath92 .",

    "such population iii sources , with only @xmath3 a few times @xmath106 in stellar material , would be below the detection threshold in the high-@xmath23 lyman dropout searches of @xcite considered by @xcite . in any case",
    "theoretical predictions of the luminosity function of population iii sources are necessarily model - dependent as they depend on the assumptions of the small - scale power and its evolution as well as the microphysics governing the various feedback effects during the collapse of the first haloes .",
    "the press - schechter type prescriptions may break down for the slope and regime of power spectra on the relevant scale @xcite and the feedback mechanisms due to the @xmath107 destruction by the lyman - werner bands radiation @xcite likely suppress star formation in a complicated halo - mass dependent way .    to resolve the faint sources responsible for the cib fluctuations , their individual flux must exceed the confusion limit usually taken to be @xmath108 times the flux dispersion produced by these emissions @xcite .",
    "lower flux sources will be drowned in the confusion noise ; of course , this is precisely where cib studies would take off . if such sources were to contribute the cib required by our data , at 3.6  they had to have the average surface density of @xmath109 . to avoid the confusion limit and resolve these sources individually at , say , 5-sigma level ( @xmath110=5 ) one would need a beam area @xmath111 or circular radius @xmath30.07 @xmath76arcsec .",

    "in any case , at 1.1 and 1.6 confusion is not reached until @xmath114 @xcite . if the first stars produced dusty environments their far - ir luminosities will be substantial and these sources should be visible at wavelengths redshifted today to mm and sub - mm bands . in that case , they may be resolvable with the alma large array , whose sub - mm resolution is better than 0.02@xmath115 .    finally , the fluctuations are unlikely to come from low - luminosity low-@xmath23 normal galaxies",
