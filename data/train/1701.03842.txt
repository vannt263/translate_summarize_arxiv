    "to study the interplay of disorder and electron interactions , we utilize the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian of the form @xmath10 where @xmath13 is the number operator , and @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are site , orbital , and spin indices , respectively . the first term @xmath11 describes the single - particle hamiltonian",
    "this is obtained by downfolding the kohn - sham bloch functions using a set of symmetry - adapted wannier functions  @xcite that can accurately describe the states around the fermi level . in our case , these functions are boron and nitrogen @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 orbitals of 18-band spin - restricted @xmath11 that accurately describes the dft band structure in the energy interval of interest .",
    "the second term represents the disorder modeled by a binary site potentials @xmath21 , where 0(@xmath22 ) represent the absence ( presence ) of a vacancy , with the vacancy potential @xmath22 being a lot greater than the material bandwidth .",
    "the vacancy is generated by a random disorder configurations using the probability mass functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 for b and n sites , respectively , where the averaged boron vacancy concentration @xmath9 satisfies the stoichiometry b@xmath25n of the disordered material .",
    "the last term describes the coulomb repulsion @xmath7 between two electrons occupying site @xmath14 incorporated self - consistently into our formalism via interacting , non - local cluster self - energy ( @xmath69(i , j\\neq i)$ ] ) , which is up to second order in the perturbation expansion of the interactions , @xmath70 .",

    "we instead , obtain approximate green functions based on the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation ( tmdca ) .",
    "the tmdca is a mean - field approach with an intrinsic order parameter based on the typical dos that `` properly '' characterizes disordered and/or interacting electron systems even in the proximity of electron localization .",
    "the tmdca self - consistency is based on a formalism consistent with the generalized dynamical cluster theory approaches to correlated electron systems  @xcite . through a set of self - consistency equations , the tmdca approach maps a disordered lattice onto a finite cluster embedded in a typical medium , as illustrated in fig.1(a ) of the main text and explained therein , and described in details below .",
    "the self - consistency procedure follows : ( i ) after obtaining @xmath11 from a converged , density functional theory ( dft ) calculations by downfolding the kohn - sham bloch functions using a set of symmetry - adapted wannier functions  @xcite , we make an initial guess of a hybridization function @xmath31 .",
    "the hybridization function measures the escape rate of electrons from the cluster to the effective medium .",
    "( ii ) we fourier transform the hybridization function to real space , @xmath71 $ ] and then for a given vacancy configuration , form the cluster green function @xmath72 .",

    "an additional internal self - consistency is used to converge @xmath76 and @xmath79 .",
    "this internal self - consistency ensures that @xmath76 is numerically the same as the one that could be obtained using the fully dressed green function , but , at a fraction of the computation cost  @xcite .",
    "this is important as it is the most computational intensive part of the self - consistency .",
    "also , it enables the systematic incorporation of crossing diagrams ( for @xmath80 ) from both the disorder due to vacancy and electron interactions at equal footing  @xcite .",
    "( iv ) for a given electron interaction strength and randomly generated disorder due to boron vacancy configuration @xmath34 , the fully dressed cluster green function @xmath81 is calculated , where @xmath35 is the second - order expansion of the electron interactions obtained self - consistently , as illustrated in the secondary loop in fig.1(a ) of the main text using the diagram shown in fig .",

    "the essence of this plot is to benchmark the convergence of the tmdca@dft method . in both cases",
    ", the tdos systematically converges as @xmath26 increases throughout almost the entire energy spectrum .",
    "this rather fast convergence ensures that with relatively small @xmath26 , accurate results can be obtained , enabling simulation of many - orbital material as in our hexagonal boron nitride example .",
    "even the @xmath84 cluster gives qualitative results , which could be important for computations of larger systems .",
    "note also that in the interacting limit , there are additional scattering processes leading to the emergence of deep - level impurity states .",
    "this fast convergence also makes it difficult to carry out standard finite - size - scaling of the tdos .",
    "however , since the tdos profile at almost all energy is converged as a function of @xmath26 , our calculations remain in the thermodynamic limit to within the computation error of our method .",
    "the tmdca self - consistently calculates the crucial , critical order parameter describing the disorder - induced formation of electronic bound state , by focusing on the typical ( most probable ) local density of the states .",

    "<S> we present a first - principles - based many - body typical medium dynamical cluster approximation tmdca@dft method for characterizing electron localization in disordered structures . </S>",
    "<S> this method applied to monolayer hexagonal boron nitride shows that the presence of a boron vacancies could turn this wide - gap insulator into a correlated metal . </S>",

    "<S> we also explore the distribution of the local density of states , a fingerprint of spatial variations , which allows localized and delocalized states to be distinguished . </S>",

    "<S> computational approaches for studying correlated , disordered materials generally rely on either density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite using supercells or the dynamical mean - field approximation ( dmfa )  @xcite , including cluster extensions  @xcite . while the dft supercell approach can only describe ordered defect structures , dmfa deals explicitly with statistical disorder distributions  @xcite , as does the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) . </S>",
    "<S> traditional dmfa / cpa methods use arithmetic averages in their self - consistent - field ( scf ) routines , and therefore lose essential information about the distribution of the local density of states @xmath2 . moreover , these methods use arithmetically averaged density of states , @xmath3 , which can not distinguish between extended and localized states  @xcite . therefore , we will instead adopt the typical medium dynamical cluster approximation ( tmdca )  @xcite , which is built around a geometrically averaged density of states @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> this latter average is sensitive to skewness in the local density of states distribution @xmath5 $ ]  [ see fig.[f.1](b ) ] , making @xmath6 a suitable _ order parameter _ for characterizing localization transitions  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the tmdca approach has both experimental and theoretical support  @xcite and has been successfully used to describe disordered and/or interacting model systems  @xcite .    in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we extend the tmdca approach to physical materials with electronic properties computed from density - functional theory ( tmdca@dft ) . </S>",

    "<S> this first - principles - based many - body approach is expected to provide further insight into electron localization and imts in real materials . </S>",
    "<S> herein , we apply the tmdca@dft approach to explore a correlation - mediated imt in monolayer hexagonal boron nitride ( @xmath1-bn )  @xcite shown in fig.[f.2](a ) . as a two - dimensional ( 2d ) crystal  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , monolayer @xmath1-bn is a candidate material for use in electronics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the challenge is that unlike graphene , @xmath1-bn lacks inversion symmetry  @xcite with the difference in electronegativity between b and n sites making @xmath1-bn a wide - gap insulator  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that strain - engineering could shrink the band gap  @xcite but so far not enough to make @xmath1-bn useful for field - effect transistors ( fets ) . motivated in part by the recent experimental observation of imts in @xmath1-bn nanostructures  @xcite and related materials  @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we explore the possibility to obtain conduction in @xmath1-bn through a disorder - induced imt . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations reveal an imt requiring the presence of both electron interactions and disorder with the transition following a monotonic curve [ see fig.[f.1](c ) ] . assuming a hubbard-@xmath7 similar to that in graphene with @xmath8ev  @xcite , our calculations suggest that the imt could potentially be found at an averaged boron vacancy concentration @xmath9 as low as @xmath0 .    </S>",
    "<S> to study localization in the presence of disorder and electron interaction , we adopt the anderson - hubbard hamiltonian of the form @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the single - particle hamiltonian , @xmath12 is a disorder potential , and @xmath13 is the number operator , where @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and @xmath16 are site , orbital , and spin indices , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the three terms above describe respectively single - particle , disorder , and electron interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> herein , we obtain the single - particle hamiltonian from dft  @xcite calculations using the linearized augmented plane - wave method , as implemented in wien2k  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> structural and electronic optimization was obtained using the perdew - burke - ernzerhof  @xcite exchange - correlation functional . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply a downfolding method to generate , from the kohn - sham bloch functions , a set of symmetry - adapted wannier functions  @xcite that can accurately describe the states around the fermi level . in our case , these functions are boron and nitrogen @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 orbitals , and as can be seen in fig.[f.2](b ) , the obtained 18-band spin - restricted @xmath11 accurately reproduces the dft band structure in the energy interval of interest . </S>",
    "<S> both band structures also show a direct band gap @xmath20ev at the brillouin zone corner points , in good agreement with experiments  @xcite .    disorder can take many forms , including impurities , adatoms , and vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> regardless of the origin , we describe disorder through the difference between the single - particle hamiltonian for the disordered and pristine structures . </S>",
    "<S> although this difference hamiltonian comprises off - diagonal as well as diagonal elements , the former are generally smaller and for clarity has been dropped from eq.([e.1 ] ) . in the boron nitride example , we focus on boron vacancies , as the b sublattice is more prone to defects due to the lower threshold energy for knock - on damage than the n sublattice  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we confirmed this observation from our calculations of the vacancy formation energies in the b and n sublattices [ see fig.[f.3](d ) ] .    </S>",

    "<S> random disorder configurations are then generated using the probability mass functions @xmath23 and @xmath24 for b and n sites , respectively , where the averaged boron vacancy concentration @xmath9 satisfies the stoichiometry b@xmath25n of the disordered material .    </S>",
    "<S> electronic properties , including many physical measurable attributes , can be obtained knowing the single - particle green function . </S>",
    "<S> obtaining the full single - particle green function for an infinite disordered lattice , however , is not feasible . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we instead rely on approximate green functions , in our case , based on the tmdca . the tmdca is based on a formalism consistent with the generalized dynamical cluster theory approaches to correlated electron systems . </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the main steps of the tmdca@dft self - consistency are outlined below with additional details provided in sm  @xcite .    through a set of scf equations , the tmdca approach maps a disordered lattice onto a finite cluster embedded in a typical medium , as illustrated in fig.[f.1](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the cluster is a periodically repeated cell containing @xmath26 primitive cells , which results in the first brillouin zone of the original lattice being divided into @xmath26 non - overlapping cells , where each cell centered at the wave vector @xmath27 contains a set of wave vectors @xmath28 , where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are wave vectors generated by the translational symmetry of the cluster and the original lattice , respectively  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the clusters allow for resonance effects and , by increasing @xmath26 , we can systematically incorporate longer - range spatial fluctuations . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath47 is then used in ( ii ) to close the primary scf loop . </S>",
    "<S> convergence is achieved when @xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> the convergence of the tmdca@dft formalism as function of increasing cluster size is discussed in the sm  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> let us at this point focus on our @xmath1-bn example . before proceeding to the general case , </S>",
    "<S> let us first consider the noninteracting limit . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ f.3](a ) shows the typical density of states ( tdos ) for an @xmath49 cluster at various b vacancy concentrations @xmath9 . for delocalized states , </S>",
    "<S> the tdos is expected to be similar to the arithmetically averaged density of states ( ados ) . </S>",
    "<S> close to the localization transition , however , the tdos , unlike the ados , is a strongly varying , non - self - averaging quantity with substantial weight only on a few lattice sites  @xcite . as @xmath9 increases in fig.[f.3](a ) , we see structure develop at the valance band edge . </S>",
    "<S> the fermi level also shifts to lower energy defined with respect to @xmath50 , implying @xmath18-type doping . </S>",
    "<S> even with a concentration as high as @xmath51% , we find that the insulating phase is stabilized . </S>",
    "<S> to further verify this , we performed relaxed supercell calculations at @xmath52% ( not shown ) and @xmath53% shown in fig.[f.3](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> both calculations show insulating behavior , suggesting that vacancies alone are not sufficient to induce an imt in @xmath1-bn .    to gain insight into the energetics of the vacancy formation and the stability of the disordered @xmath1-bn , we calculated the formation energy @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the total energies of the vacancy and pristine structures , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> as shown in fig.[f.3](d ) , @xmath57 is positive and increases with increasing vacancy concentration , though the energy cost is less for b vacancies . additionally , the lack of a kink in the @xmath57 curves indicates an absence of a transition , a further confirmation that the insulating state is stabilized against disorder .    </S>",
    "<S> next , we investigate the combined effects of vacancies and electron interactions , focusing on the paramagnetic phase . </S>",
    "<S> an exploration of the ( @xmath9 , @xmath7 ) parameter space revealed that an imt occurs roughly at @xmath58ev@xmath59 , as shown in fig.[f.1](c ) . in fig.[f.4](a ) , we show the tdos for an @xmath60 cluster at @xmath61 and various @xmath7 . as in the noninteracting limit , </S>",
    "<S> impurity states develop within the gap for small @xmath7 . around @xmath62ev , however , valence and conduction states merge , signaling a transition from a band insulator to a correlated metal . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the presence of interactions induces an imt , even at a modest boron vacancy concentration . </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the imt to the injection of mobile carriers caused by inelastic scattering processes hybridizing localized and delocalized states  @xcite . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , the hybridization occurs between impurity states from the valence and low - energy conduction band states . </S>",
    "<S> there is no need for thermal activation ; rather , the necessary energy is mostly provided by the electron interaction . </S>",
    "<S> that these correlated impurity states delocalize  @xcite also means that the carriers do not decay into other localized states existing within the gap  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> instead , the disorder is screened  @xcite in these hybridized states allowing them to become extended  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this rich many - body physics underscores that electron interaction is critical in the description of the imt in @xmath1-bn .    an important physical observable for characterizing disordered materials </S>",
    "<S> is the local density of states distribution p@xmath63 $ ] , which could be measured in optoelectronic experiments . </S>",
    "<S> more specifically , p@xmath63 $ ] is a well - defined fingerprint of the spatial variations of the local density of states , which tends towards gaussian and log - normal distributions in the metallic and insulating phases , respectively  @xcite , as illustrated in fig.[f.1](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> figures  [ f.3](b ) and [ f.4](b ) show the normalized p@xmath63 $ ] calculated at various energies for various @xmath9 at @xmath64 ev and @xmath61 for @xmath65ev , respectively . in the noninteracting limit , gaussian distributions are observed for @xmath66ev and @xmath67 but not for @xmath68ev . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected as the latter is located in the gap below the conduction band , where the electrons are prone to being localized . with interaction , </S>",
    "<S> p@xmath63 $ ] is reminiscent of a disordered metal for all the energies considered  @xcite . except for the locations of the peaks , note that p@xmath63 $ ] is qualitatively similar for the three energies . </S>",
    "<S> we are not aware of any other computational studies of p@xmath63 $ ] in the presence of interaction . in the interacting case , </S>",
    "<S> p@xmath63 $ ] could be identified as depicting the spatial nature of quasiparticle many - body excitations rather than single - particle states . </S>",
    "<S> we speculate that the correlation length of these excitations , especially near the imt , will be reduced due to inelastic processes and multisite scattering , including those from deeply trapped states .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , we have presented a first - principles - based many - body approach for characterizing localization in disordered materials and applied it to study monolayer @xmath1-bn in the presence of electron interactions and randomly distributed boron vacancies . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations show an imt , in which electron interactions play a critical role by hybridizing impurity states with low - energy states in the conduction band to form degenerate states within the gap . </S>",
    "<S> this imt opens up the possibility of conduction in @xmath1-bn .    </S>",
