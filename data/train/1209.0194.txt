    "* background . * consider the following problem  given a set @xmath7 of labeled points in the plane , no three collinear , what is the number of graphs that have a straight - edge crossing - free embedding over @xmath7 ?",
    "that is , we consider graphs whose vertex set is ( or is mapped to ) @xmath7 and whose edges are drawn as straight segments connecting the corresponding pairs of points , so that these segments do not cross each other ( at a point in their relative interiors ) .",
    "for example , if @xmath7 is a set of @xmath2 points in convex position , the answer is known to be @xmath8 @xcite",
    ". the more general problem asks for the maximum number of crossing - free straight - edge graphs that can be embedded over any specific set of @xmath2 points in the plane .",
    "the first exponential bound , @xmath9 , on the number of such graphs was proved by ajtai  et al .",
    "@xcite back in 1982 .",
    "since then , progressively ( and significantly ) smaller upper bounds have been derived ( for example , see @xcite ) .",
    "upper bounds on numbers of more specific types of crossing - free straight - edge graphs , such as hamiltonian cycles , spanning trees , perfect matchings , and triangulations , were also studied ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "worst - case lower bounds for these numbers have also been obtained ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "research on the above problems has led to the development of several useful combinatorial techniques , many of which are interesting in their own right .",
    "one such distant achievement was the introduction of the _ catalan numbers _ by euler and lam @xcite .",
    "a more recent development was the derivation of the _ crossing lemma _",
    ", obtained by ajtai  et al .",
    "@xcite . in this paper",
    "we discuss another novel combinatorial technique that has recently emerged from research on the above counting problems .",
    "namely , this is the concept of _ cross - graph charging schemes_.    the idea of applying charging schemes to obtain graph properties probably originated from the attempts of heesch to prove the _ four colors theorem _ @xcite .",
    "later , his ideas were used in appel and haken s famous proof of the theorem @xcite , and their extensions have become a common technique in graph theory ( e.g. , see @xcite ) .",
    "this technique involves giving charges to vertices ( or edges , or faces , for graphs drawn in the plane ) of a graph @xmath10 , and then moving these charges between various vertices ( or edges , or faces ) of @xmath10 . the novel approach of moving such charges between vertices and edges _ of different graphs over the same point set _ originated by sharir and welzl in 2006 @xcite , in studying the maximum number of triangulations that can be embedded over a specific set of @xmath2 points in the plane .",
    "since then , this technique has been extended in @xcite to study various combinatorial and algorithmic properties of triangulations .    in this paper , we extend the idea of cross - graph charging schemes beyond the realm of triangulations .",
    "we first show how to apply this technique to bound the maximum number of crossing - free straight - edge graphs that can be embedded over a specific set of points in the plane .",
    "then we show how to extend this idea to several other types of graphs , including families of non - planar graphs ( this seems to be the first derivation of reasonable bounds for such graph types ) .",
    "it seems likely that these techniques can be further extended to other types of problems ( that is , problems not involving bounding or counting the number of embedded graphs ) , and we hope that the present study will motivate such applications . before discussing our results any further , we require some formal definitions of the concepts related to these problems .",
    "* notations and results . * a _ planar graph _ is a graph that can be embedded in the plane in such a way that its vertices are embedded as points and its edges are embedded as jordan arcs that connect the respective pairs of points and can meet only at a common endpoint .",
    "a _ crossing - free straight - edge graph _ is a plane embedding of a planar graph such that its edges are embedded as non - crossing straight line segments ; we sometimes refer to such graphs simply as _",
    "plane graphs_. in section  [ sec : plane ] we only consider plane graphs . in section  [ sec : quasi ]",
    "we allow certain types of crossings by considering _ quasi - planar graphs _ ; here too we assume that the edges are embedded as ( possibly crossing ) straight line segments . in both sections",
    "we only consider embeddings where the points are in general position , that is , where no three points are collinear . for upper bounds on the number of graphs , this involves no loss of generality , because the number of graphs can only grow when a degenerate point set is slightly perturbed into general position .    a _ triangulation _ of a finite point set @xmath7 in the plane is a maximal plane graph on @xmath7 ( that is , no additional straight edges can be inserted without crossing any of the existing edges ) , so all bounded faces of the planar map that it defines are triangles .",
    "for a set @xmath7 of points in the plane , we denote by @xmath11 the set of all triangulations of @xmath7 , and put @xmath12 .",
    "similarly , we denote by @xmath13 the set of all plane graphs of @xmath7 , and put @xmath14 . finally , let @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "so another way of formulating our problem is  find a small constant @xmath17 ( ideally , find the smallest ) such that @xmath18 .",
    ", @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , we neglect polynomial factors . ]",
    "( by the results mentioned above , we know that such a @xmath17 exists . )    notice that every plane graph is contained in at least one triangulation . also , by euler s formula , every triangulation has fewer than @xmath21 edges , and thus , every triangulation contains fewer than @xmath22 plane graphs . from",
    "the above we have the inequality @xmath23 , which implies @xmath24 .",
    "every several years an improved upper bound for @xmath25 is discovered ( e.g. , see @xcite ) , and currently , the best known bound is @xmath26 @xcite . combining this",
    "bound with the above inequality implies @xmath27 .",
    "currently , the best known lower bound is @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the inequality @xmath24 seems rather weak , since it potentially counts some plane graphs many times ( once for every triangulation containing the graph ) .",
    "razen , snoeyink , and welzl @xcite were the first to address this inefficiency , deriving the slightly improved inequality @xmath29 .",
    "a more significant improvement of @xmath30 was recently obtained by hoffmann et al .",
    "this implies the bound @xmath31 .",
    "as far as we know , our cross - graph charging - scheme method is currently the only method that does not rely on the ratio between @xmath32 and @xmath25 and yields a non - astronomical bound .",
    "an initial , more direct application of this method implies only a bound of @xmath33 . on the other hand , by combining this method with the current bound on the number of triangulations ( indirectly , by using an upper bound on the maximum number of plane graphs with at least @xmath34 edges , which is derived in @xcite and relies on @xmath25 ) we obtain @xmath35 .",
    "our method relies on charging schemes between objects from different plane graphs over the same point set ( hence the name _ cross - graph charging schemes _ ) .",
    "given a set @xmath7 of @xmath2 points in the plane , we consider the set @xmath36 and call each of its elements a _ ving _  ( _ v_ertex _ in _ _ g_raph , similar to the definition of a _",
    "vint___v__ertex _ _ in t__riangulation  from @xcite ) .",
    "intuitively , a ving is an instance of a vertex ( a point of @xmath7 ) in a specific plane graph .",
    "our charging schemes are between vings from different graphs ( sharing a common vertex ) .    a _ @xmath4-quasi - plane _",
    "graph is a straight - edge graph over a set of points in the plane that may contain crossings , but does not contain any set of @xmath4 pairwise crossing edges ( some other works , such as @xcite , refer to such graphs as @xmath4-_quasi - planar geometric graphs _ ) .",
    "notice that a 2-quasi - plane graph is simply a plane graph .",
    "for a set @xmath7 of points in the plane , we denote by @xmath37 the set of all @xmath4-quasi - plane graphs on @xmath7 , and put @xmath38 .",
    "moreover , we let @xmath39 . as far as we know ,",
    "there are no previously known singly exponential upper bounds on @xmath40 , for any @xmath41 .",
    "we show that an appropriate extension of our technique easily implies the bounds @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "these bounds are probably very far from being tight , but our purpose here is to show that the number of 3-quasi - plane graphs , say , that can be embedded over a specific point set is only exponential in the number of points . as a side remark , we note that the first bound , on @xmath44 , is significantly smaller than the first exponential bound ( @xmath9 ) that was obtained for the number of plane graphs @xcite .",
    "we also show that the main conjecture about quasi - planar graphs ( namely , that the number of their edges is linear for any fixed @xmath4 , e.g. , see @xcite ) would imply , if true , that @xmath40 is ( only ) exponential in @xmath2 for any fixed @xmath4 .",
    "in fact , our exponential bounds for @xmath44 and @xmath45 derive from the fact that the number of edges of @xmath46-quasi - plane and @xmath47-quasi - plane graphs is linear in the number of vertices  @xcite .",
    "in this section we derive upper bounds on the number of plane graphs . in section  [ ssec : direct ] , we derive the initial bound @xmath48 . in section  [ ssec :",
    "firstimp ] , we exploit some geometric aspects of the problem , to improve the bound to @xmath49 . even though this is far worse than the recent bound @xmath31 @xcite , it constitutes a significant progress in deriving bounds that do not depend on @xmath25 . in section  [ ssec : imp ] , we extend our technique to obtain the bound @xmath35 , which is currently the best known upper bound for this quantity .",
    "this extension is a combination of our technique with some recently obtained bounds on the number of certain types of plane graphs ( from @xcite ) .",
    "these latter bounds do depend on the number of triangulations , but the way we exploit these bounds makes our new bound ( that is , @xmath0 ) depend _ non - linearly _ on @xmath25 ; see below for details . in section  [ ssec : connected ] , we apply the technique to upper bound the numbers of some other types of plane graphs , such as connected and bi - connected plane graphs .",
    "these bounds are only slightly better than our bound for the number of plane graphs , but it is the first time where these subfamilies admit better upper bounds than for the overall number of plane graphs . we also show how to obtain various degree - related bounds for vertices in a random plane graph over a fixed set of points , using the same technique .      given two vertices @xmath50 of a plane graph @xmath10 , we say that @xmath51 _ sees _",
    "@xmath52 in @xmath10 if the ( straight ) edge @xmath53 does not cross any edge of @xmath10 .",
    "the _ degree _ of a ving @xmath54 is the degree ( number of neighbors ) of @xmath51 in @xmath10 ; a ving of degree @xmath55 is called an _",
    "@xmath55-ving_. we say that a ving @xmath56 is an _ @xmath57-ving _ if we can not increase the degree of @xmath51 by inserting additional ( straight ) edges to @xmath10 ( that is , @xmath51 can not see any vertex that is not connected to it in @xmath10 ) .",
    "we say that a ving @xmath58 _ corresponds _ to the @xmath57-ving @xmath56 if @xmath10 is obtained by inserting into @xmath59 all the edges that connect @xmath51 to the points that it sees in @xmath59 and is not connected to them .",
    "notice that every ving corresponds to a unique @xmath57-ving . given a plane graph @xmath60 ,",
    "we denote by @xmath61 the number of @xmath55-vings in @xmath10 , for @xmath62 , and by @xmath63 the number of @xmath57-vings in @xmath10 .",
    "finally , the expected value of @xmath63 , for a graph chosen uniformly at random from @xmath13 , is denoted as @xmath64 .",
    "more formally , @xmath65 .",
    "a similar notation , @xmath66 , applies to the expected value of @xmath61 .",
    "the following lemma , inspired by similar lemmas in @xcite , presents a connection between @xmath67 and upper bounds for @xmath32 .",
    "[ le : numberofpg ] for @xmath68 , let @xmath69 be a real number , such that @xmath70 holds for every set @xmath7 of @xmath2 points in the plane in general position . then @xmath71 .",
    "let @xmath7 be a set that maximizes @xmath72 among all sets of @xmath2 points in the plane .",
    "note that we can get some plane graphs of @xmath7 by choosing a point @xmath73 and a plane graph @xmath10 of @xmath74 , inserting @xmath52 into @xmath10 , and then connecting @xmath52 to all of the vertices that it can see in @xmath10 .",
    "in fact , a plane graph @xmath10 of @xmath7 can be obtained in exactly @xmath63 ways in this manner ( in particular , if @xmath75 , @xmath10 can not be obtained at all in this fashion ) .",
    "this is easily seen to imply that @xmath76    the leftmost expression equals @xmath77 , and the rightmost expression is at most @xmath78 .",
    "hence , with @xmath79 , we have @xmath80 .",
    "we thus seek a lower bound for @xmath67 , of the kind assumed in lemma [ le : numberofpg ] .",
    "for this purpose , we use a charging scheme similar in spirit to the one presented in @xcite .",
    "the following lemma establishes such a bound , which is rather weak .",
    "nevertheless , it has the advantage of being a  stand - alone \" bound , independent of ( bounds on ) the number of triangulations on @xmath7 . in the following subsections",
    ", we will derive a considerably improved bound , which does depend on ( the best known bound on ) the number of triangulations of @xmath7 ( albeit in a nonlinear manner ) .",
    "[ le : lowerv0 ] for every set @xmath7 of @xmath2 points in the plane in general position , @xmath81 .",
    "we use a charging scheme where every @xmath55-ving @xmath56 is given @xmath82 units of charge .",
    "the sum of the charges of the vings in any fixed plane graph @xmath60 is @xmath83 .",
    "since @xmath10 can have at most @xmath84 edges , we have @xmath85 .",
    "this implies that the total charge in any fixed graph is at least @xmath86 .",
    "therefore , on average , every ving has a charge larger than 1 .",
    "next , every @xmath55-ving moves its entire charge to its corresponding @xmath57-ving .",
    "( in general , the @xmath57-ving lies in a graph different than the one containing the @xmath55-ving . )",
    "this results with all of the charge being placed only on @xmath57-vings .",
    "if we can show that every @xmath57-ving gets charged at most @xmath87 units in this manner , we will get the lower bound @xmath88 , as is easily verified .",
    "to upper bound the charge that an @xmath57-ving @xmath56 can get , we need to consider the degree @xmath89 of @xmath90 .",
    "notice that the number of @xmath55-vings that charge @xmath90 is exactly @xmath91 ( that is , the number of ways to remove @xmath92 edges that are adjacent to @xmath51 in @xmath10 ) .",
    "therefore , the total charge to @xmath90 is @xmath93    this expression maximizes when @xmath89 is either 12 or 13 , and is then 4096 .",
    "thus , on average , a plane graph of @xmath7 has more than @xmath94 @xmath57-vings .",
    "combining lemmas [ le : numberofpg ] and [ le : lowerv0 ] and using an obvious induction on @xmath2 ( starting with @xmath95 ) , we obtain    @xmath96 .",
    "* the above analysis remains valid if we charge 0-vings instead of @xmath57-vings .",
    "that is , each @xmath55-ving @xmath54 passes its charge to the 0-ving @xmath97 obtained by removing all the edges incident to @xmath51 in @xmath10 .",
    "this is also the case for several of the other proofs in this paper , but not for all of them ( several proofs in section  [ ssec : connected ] do not seem to be amenable to this modification ) .",
    "interestingly , the bound in section  [ ssec : direct ] hardly relies on the geometric properties of the problem .",
    "specifically , it only uses euler s formula for plane graphs , and the trivial property , already noted , that in a plane graph , connecting a ving to any subset of the vertices that it sees results in a ( larger ) plane graph . in this subsection",
    "we obtain an improved bound by observing and exploiting some additional geometric properties of @xmath57-vings .",
    "[ le : lowerv0imp ] for every set @xmath7 of @xmath2 points in the plane in general position , @xmath98 .",
    "we start by applying the same charging scheme as in the proof of lemma [ le : lowerv0 ] , but then perform another step of moving charges across @xmath57-vings , as follows .",
    "we say that an @xmath57-ving @xmath56 is an @xmath99-ving if @xmath90 is also an @xmath55-ving .",
    "according to the analysis in the proof of lemma [ le : lowerv0 ] , only @xmath100-vings and @xmath101-vings are charged 4096 ; the next highest charge ( for @xmath102-vings ) is 3072 . at the other end , an @xmath103-ving is charged only 44 , and an @xmath104-ving is charged only 24 . note that an @xmath57-ving @xmath54 can be an @xmath104-ving only if @xmath51 is part of the boundary of the convex hull of @xmath7 and the two neighbors of @xmath51 along this boundary are connected in @xmath10 ( e.g. , see fig .
