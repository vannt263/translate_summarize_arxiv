    "polymers are abstractions of chains of molecules embedded in a solvent by non - self - intersecting polygonal paths of points whose probabilities are themselves random ( reflecting impurities of the solvent ) . in this connection , tree polymers take advantage of a particular way to determine path structure and their probabilities as follows .",
    "three different references to paths occur in this formulation .",
    "an _ @xmath0-tree path _ is a sequence @xmath1 emanating from a root @xmath2 .",
    "a _ finite tree path _ or _ vertex _",
    "@xmath3 is a finite sequence @xmath4 , read path @xmath5 restricted to level @xmath6 , of length @xmath7 .",
    "the symbol @xmath8 denotes concatenation of finite tree paths ; if @xmath9 and @xmath10 , then @xmath11 .",
    "vertices belong to @xmath12 , and can be viewed as unique finite paths to the root of the directed binary tree @xmath13 equipped with the obvious graph structure .",
    "we also write @xmath14 for the boundary of @xmath13 .",
    "the third type of path , and the one of main interest to polymer questions , is that of the _ polygonal tree path _ defined by @xmath15 , @xmath16 , with @xmath17 , for a given @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 is a compact , topological abelian group for coordinate - wise multiplication and the product topology .",
    "the _ uniform distribution _ on @xmath0-tree paths is the haar measure on @xmath20 , i.e. @xmath21    let @xmath22 be an i.i.d .",
    "family of positive random variables on @xmath23 with @xmath24 ; we denote a generic random variable with the common distribution of @xmath25 by @xmath26 . without loss of generality",
    "we may assume that @xmath27 . define a sequence of _ random probability measures _",

    "occurance of the event @xmath37 $ ] is refered to as _ weak disorder _ and that of @xmath38 $ ] as _ strong disorder _ ; see bolthausen ( 1989 ) . in particular , the critical case @xmath39 is strong disorder . in the case of tree polymers",
    "one may view the notions of weak / strong in terms of a disorder parameter defined by @xmath40 and relative to the branching rate , @xmath41 .",
    "in this short communication we provide some new insights into a few delicate problems for the case of strong disorder .",
    "to set the stage for contrast , we record a rather robust consequence of weak disorder .    under weak disorder , there is a random probability measure @xmath42 on @xmath43 such that a.s .",
    "@xmath44 where @xmath45 denotes weak convergence .",

    ", @xmath48 converges vaguely to a non - zero random measure @xmath49 on @xmath20 with probability one . by definition of weak disorder @xmath50 a.s .",
    ", thus we obtain @xmath51    notice that in the case of no disorder , i.e. @xmath52 a.s . , one has @xmath53 moreover , under @xmath54 , the polygonal paths are simply symmetric simple random walk paths , where the probability theory is quite will - known and complete .",
    "for example , the central limit theorem takes the form @xmath55 for probability laws involving convergence in distribution , one may ask if the clt continues to hold a.s . with @xmath54 replaced by @xmath28 .",
    "this form of universality was answered in the affirmative by waymire and williams ( 2010 ) for weak disorder under the additional assumption that @xmath56 for some @xmath57 .",
    "problems involving limit laws such as a.s .",
    "strong laws , a.s . laws of the iterated logarithm , etc , however , require an infinite volume probability @xmath58 for their formulation . while the preceding proposition answers this in the case of weak disorder , the problem is open for strong disorder .",
    "moreover , it has been speculated by yuval peres ( private communication ) that @xmath28 will a.s .",
    "have infinitely many weak limit points under strong disorder .",
    "however , in the case of critical strong disorder we show that a natural infinite volume polymer exists and is related to the finite volume polymers through limits in probability .",
    "in this section we show the existence under critical strong disorder , i.e. , assuming @xmath59 , of an infinite volume polymer probability @xmath58 that may be viewed as the weak limit in probability of the sequence @xmath60 in the sense that its characteristic function is the limit in probability of the corresponding sequence of characteristic functions of @xmath61 .    for @xmath62 , @xmath63 ,",
    "say , let @xmath64 since @xmath13 is countable there are countably many such finite - dimensional rectangles in @xmath19 .",
    "for @xmath65 , note that @xmath66    for example , @xmath67 @xmath68 since there are @xmath69 such @xmath3 s , half of which have @xmath70 and the other half have @xmath71 .    for @xmath72 , we have @xmath73 where @xmath74 in particular , @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the root .    note that @xmath77 thus , letting @xmath78 , @xmath79 where ( i ) the convergence to @xmath80 is the almost sure limit of the _ derivative martingale _ obtained by biggins and kyprianou ( 2004 ) , and ( ii ) @xmath81 is the limit in probability at critical strong disorder recently obtained by aidkon and shi ( 2011 ) .",
    "the constant @xmath82 , for @xmath83 , does not depend on @xmath62 .",
    "aidkon and shi ( 2011 ) also point out that the almost sure positivity of @xmath80 follows from biggins and kyprianou ( 2004 ) and aidkon ( 2011 ) the sequence @xmath84 is referred to as the seneta - heyde scaling .    for each @xmath62",
    ", there is a set @xmath85 of probability zero such that @xmath86 since @xmath13 is countable , the set @xmath87 is still a @xmath88-null subset of @xmath89 .",
    "the almost sure convergence of the derivative martingales is essential to the construction of @xmath90 given in the lemma below .",
    "we now define @xmath91 for @xmath92 .",
    "@xmath93 extends to a unique probability on @xmath94 for each @xmath92 .",
    "we use caratheodory extension , taking careful advantage of the fact that the sets @xmath95 , @xmath62 , are both open and closed subsets of the compact set @xmath19 . for @xmath96",
    ", @xmath97 extends to the algebra generated by @xmath98 by addition .",
    "since @xmath19 is compact and the rectangles are both open and closed , countable additivity on this algebra must hold as a consequence of finite additivity ; i.e. if @xmath99 is contained in the algebra generated by @xmath98 , then @xmath99 is closed , hence compact , and its own open cover , i.e. @xmath100 for some finite subsequence @xmath101 of @xmath102 .    at critical strong disorder , for each finite set @xmath103 @xmath104 where @xmath105 denote their respective fourier transforms as probabilities on the compact abelian multiplicative group @xmath19 for the product topology .    the continuous characters of the group @xmath19 are given by @xmath106 in particular there are only countably many characters of @xmath19 . from standard fourier analysis",
    "it follows that we need only show that @xmath107 for each finite set @xmath103 .",

    "with regard to the aforementioned a.s . limits in distribution of polygonal tree paths , waymire and williams ( 2010 ) also obtained a.s .",
    "limits of the form @xmath114 under both weak and strong disorder .",
    "let us refer to these as almost sure _ laplace rates _ in reference to the laplace principle of large deviation theory .    in the case of weak disorder",
    "the universal limit is @xmath115 , in a neighborhood of the origin , otherwise independent of the distribution of @xmath26 .",
    "in addition to being independent of the distribution of @xmath26 within the range of weak disorder , this universality of laplace rates is manifested in the coincidence with the same limit obtained for @xmath116 , i.e. , for simple symmetric random walk .    for an illustrative case of strong disorder , consider @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is standard normal and @xmath119 .",
    "then from waymire and williams ( 2010 ) , it follows that a.s . in a neighborhood of the origin that @xmath120 where @xmath121 is the uniquely determined solution to @xmath122",
    "also see waymire and williams ( sec 6 , cor 2 , 2010 ) for the general formulae in the case of strong disorder . in particular , the universality of the laplace rates breaks down , even at critical strong disorder .",
    "a graph of @xmath123 computed from matlab is indicated in figure 1 for the strong disorder case of @xmath124 .     for various @xmath125 .",
    "]    using the equations defining @xmath123 one may easily verify that @xmath126 and @xmath127 .",
    "while these specific calculations follow directly from the general results of waymire and williams ( 2010 ) , from here one is naturally lead to speculate that the asymptotic variance under strong disorder is obtained under diffusive scaling by @xmath128 precisely as @xmath129 in particular this formula continuously extends the weak disorder variance @xmath130 across @xmath131 . in any case , this quantity is a basic parameter of the rigorously proven limit @xmath123 .",
