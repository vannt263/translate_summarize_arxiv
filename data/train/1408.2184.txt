    "the violation of the fundamental symmetries of nature is an active area of research .",
    "atomic and molecular experiments , which probe @xmath8-odd and @xmath8,@xmath9-odd interactions , provide very sensitive tests of the standard model ( sm ) and physics beyond the sm @xcite . measurements and calculations of the cs @xmath10-@xmath11 parity nonconserving ( pnc ) amplitude stand as the most precise atomic test of the sm electroweak theory to date , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "experimental searches for nuclear anapole moments are ongoing in fr @xcite , yb @xcite and baf @xcite . at present",
    ", hg provides the most precise limits on the electric dipole moment ( edm ) of the proton , quark chromo - edm and @xmath8,@xmath9-odd nuclear forces , as well as the most precise limits on the neutron edm and quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) @xmath12 term from atomic or molecular experiments @xcite , while tho provides the most precise limit on the electron edm @xcite .",
    "most recently , it was suggested that edm measurements in molecules with @xmath8,@xmath9-odd nuclear magnetic quadrupole moments may lead to improved limits on the strength of @xmath8,@xmath9-odd nuclear forces , proton , neutron and quark edms , quark chromo - edm and the qcd @xmath12 term @xcite .",
    "field theories , which are constructed from the principles of locality , spin - statistics and lorentz invariance , conserve the combined @xmath13 symmetry .",
    "the violation of one or more of these three principles , presumably from some form of ultra - short distance scale physics , opens the door for the possibility of @xmath13-odd physics .",
    "some of the most stringent limits on @xmath13-odd and lorentz - invariance - violating physics come from searches for the coupling @xmath14 between a background cosmic field , @xmath15 , and the spin of an electron , proton , neutron or muon , @xmath16 @xcite . for further details on the broad range of experiments performed and a brief history of the improvements in these limits ,",
    "we refer the reader to the reviews of @xcite and the references therein .",
    "other very important unanswered questions in fundamental physics are the strong @xmath17 problem , namely the puzzling observation that qcd does not appear to violate the combined charge - parity ( @xmath17 ) symmetry , see e.g.  @xcite , and dark matter and dark energy , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "a particularly elegant solution to the strong @xmath17 problem invokes the introduction of a pseudoscalar particle known as the axion  @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "it has been noted that the axion may also be a promising cold dark matter candidate .",
    "thus axions , if detected , could resolve both the dark matter and strong @xmath17 problems  @xcite .",
    "the decay of supersymmetric axions to produce axions has also been suggested as a possible explanation for dark radiation @xcite .",
    "many tests of the fundamental symmetries of nature and searches for axion , weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp ) and topological defect dark matter involve couplings of the form @xmath18 between a field or operator @xmath19 and the spin angular momentum @xmath20 of a proton ( @xmath21 ) or neutron ( @xmath22 ) , or depend explicitly on the spin angular momenta of the nucleons involved .",
    "we point out that in experiments , which measure nuclear spin - dependent ( nsd ) properties , the contribution of non - valence nucleon spins can not be neglected , due to polarisation of these nucleons by the valence nucleon(s ) .",
    "nuclear many - body effects have previously been considered in association with the interpretation of atomic clock experiments @xcite , nuclear - sourced edms and nsd - pnc interactions mediated via @xmath23-boson exchange between electrons and the nucleus ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , static spin - gravity couplings @xcite and long - range dipole - dipole couplings @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we calculate the proton and neutron spin contributions for a wide range of nuclei , which are of experimental interest in tests of the fundamental symmetries of nature and searches for dark matter , including axions , wimps and topological defects , using semi - empirical methods , as well as a novel hybrid _",
    "ab initio_/semi - empirical method .",
    "we then demonstrate that core - polarisation corrections to _ ab initio _ nuclear shell model calculations generally reduce discrepancies in proton and neutron spin expectation values from different calculations . as an illustration of the importance of many - body effects in such studies , we revisit the experiments of refs .",
    "@xcite , in which a @xmath24he/@xmath25xe comagnetometer was used to place constraints on the @xmath13 and lorentz - invariance - violating parameter @xmath26 , which quantifies the interaction strength of a background field with the spin of a neutron .",
    "we show that , due to nuclear many - body effects , the @xmath24he/@xmath25xe system is in fact also quite sensitive to proton interaction parameters . by reanalysing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , we derive a limit on the parameter @xmath27 that is the world s most stringent by a factor of 8 .",
    "likewise , by reanalysing the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in which a @xmath24he/@xmath25xe comagnetometer was also used , we demonstrate improved sensitivities to the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath28 by one order of magnitude . from existing data in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which experiments were performed with a @xmath24he/@xmath25xe comagnetometer , we derive constraints on the spin - dependent @xmath8,@xmath9-violating interaction of a bound proton with nucleons , which for certain ranges of exchanged pseudoscalar boson masses improve on the most stringent laboratory limits by several orders of magnitude .",
    "we also extend our previous analysis of nuclear anapole moment data for cs @xcite to obtain new limits on several other @xmath13 and lorentz - invariance - violating parameters .",
    "the nuclear magnetic dipole moment @xmath29 can be expressed ( in the units of the nuclear magneton @xmath30 ) : @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the expectation values of the total proton and neutron spin angular momenta , respectively , while @xmath34 is the expectation value of the total proton orbital angular momentum . in the present work ,",
    "we consider nuclei with either one valence proton or one valence neutron ( even - even nuclei are spinless due to the nuclear pairing interaction ) .",
    "we start by considering the contribution of the valence nucleon alone . assuming all other nucleons in the nucleus are paired ( and ignoring polarisation of the nuclear core for now ) , the spin @xmath35 and nuclear magnetic dipole moment @xmath29 are due entirely to the total angular momentum of the external nucleon : @xmath36 . in this case , the nuclear magnetic dipole moment is given by the schmidt ( single - particle approximation ) formula @xmath37 with @xmath38 @xmath39 the gyromagnetic factors are : @xmath40 for a valence proton and @xmath41 for a valence neutron .",
    "we present the values for @xmath42 from eq .",
    "( [ sz0 ] ) ( `` schmidt model '' ) in tables [ tab : odd - proton_isotopes ] and [ tab : odd - neutron_isotopes ] .",
    "we now leave the single - particle approximation and consider nuclear many - body effects . for a single - particle state , the angular momenta factors in ( [ am_cf ] )",
    "can be rewritten as @xmath43 hence , unlike nsd - pnc effects arising from @xmath23-boson exchange between electrons and the nucleus @xcite , we can not simply average over the spins of the single - particle proton and neutron states without explicitly considering the angular momenta of each individual nucleon . to circumvent this difficulty ,",
    "we make use of the following approximation .",
    "note that for single - particle states with @xmath44 , the prefactors before @xmath45 in eq .",
    "( [ amo - factors ] ) are @xmath46 . for non - light nuclei , most nucleons have @xmath44 . also , the deviations of the prefactors in ( [ amo - factors ] ) from @xmath47 are of opposite sign for @xmath48 .",
    "thus for nuclei with valence nucleon(s ) , which have @xmath49 , we can approximately sum over the proton and neutron spin angular momenta that appear in ( [ amo - factors ] ) to give the many - body generalisation of formula ( [ am_cf ] ) : @xmath50 .\\ ] ] from eq .",
    "( [ am_mb - gen ] ) , we extract limits on the parameters @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 for cs , for which @xmath55 , using the calculated spin content values in table [ tab : hybrid ] .",
    "the limits are presented in table [ tab : sme - anapole_moments ] . for tl , where @xmath56 , eq .",
    "( [ am_mb - gen ] ) is not a good approximation and so we do not present many - body model limits in this case .",
    "we note that the limits in table [ tab : sme - anapole_moments ] are weaker than those that would be obtained indirectly from the most stringent limits on @xmath57 and @xmath58 , if one assumes a static background cosmic field .",
    "these corresponding upper limits are roughly as follows : @xmath59 gev , @xmath60 , @xmath61 gev and @xmath62 , assuming that the typical speed of earth relative to the static background cosmic field is @xmath63",
