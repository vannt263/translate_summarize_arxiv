    "hence the understanding of conformations and dynamics of macromolecules in such a ( quasi- ) two - dimensional geometry has been of long - standing interest @xcite .",
    "note also that many methods to characterize polymer conformations experimentally , _ e.g. _ , electron microscopy @xcite , atomic force microscopy ( afm ) @xcite , fluorescence microscopy of suitably labelled biopolymers @xcite , require that these macromolecules are attached to a substrate . in this context ,",
    "considerations of macromolecules confined to a strictly two - dimensional geometry are of interest , at least as a limiting case .",
    "the same statement holds when one considers macromolecules confined to nanoslits with non - adsorbing walls , a topic that also has found much recent interest .",
    "while the statistical mechanics of completely flexible polymers in @xmath17 dimensions has been studied extensively since a long time and is well understood @xcite , under many circumstances it should be taken into account that macromolecules are stiff and not flexible on small scales @xcite .",
    "this is true both for simple synthetic polymers _",
    "e.g. _ , polystyrene , alkane chains , _ etc .",
    "_ , and for various biopolymers , _",
    "e.g. _ , double - stranded ( ds ) and single stranded ( ss ) dna , polysaccharides , proteins , _ etc .",
    "apart from very stiff polymers ( _ e.g. _ , actin , titin , microtubules , _ etc . _ ) the  persistence length @xmath1 @xcite characterizing the stiffness typically is much less than the contour length @xmath0 of a macromolecule , and the crossover from rod - like behavior to the behavior of flexible polymers needs to be considered . as is well - known",
    ", the scales of interest range from the sub - nanometer scale to the micrometer scale @xcite , and hence in the theoretical modeling coarse - grained models must be used @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we wish to address the problem of polymer conformation and dynamics for semi - flexible polymers in two dimensions , using molecular dynamics simulations of a bead - spring type model with a bond angle potential by which we can control the stiffness of the chains over a wide range .",
    "we note that the standard analytical coarse - grained description in terms of the kratky - porod @xcite model for wormlike chains in @xmath17 dimensions is not very useful , since it neglects excluded volume effects completely , although they are known to be very important in @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "a study of semiflexible polymers in terms of a lattice model @xcite is expected to yield valid results for universal properties of semiflexible polymer , _",
    "i.e. _ , on length scales much larger than the persistence length ; but on smaller scales it can describe only stiffness of the type similar to that of alkane chains , where @xmath1 is of the order of the typical length of `` all trans '' sequences , in between monomers taking a gauche ( @xmath18 ) minimum in the torsional potential . for such cases _ e.g. _ , dsdna we expect that the ( small ) flexibility of the macromolecules is due to fluctuations in bond lengths and bond angles , rather than disorder in the population of states in the torsional potential , and then the present off - lattice model is more realistic .",
    "in addition , the lattice work @xcite applying the pruned enriched rosenbluth method ( perm )  @xcite could not address the dynamics of the chains at all .",
    "previous work on the dynamics of single semiflexible chains in dilute solution  @xcite has focused on the case @xmath19 almost exclusively , and most of the work  @xcite has studied the effect of hydrodynamic ( hd ) interactions mediated by the solvent .",
    "assuming that the substrate surface provides a stick boundary condition with respect to solvent fluid flow , one can show @xcite that hd interactions are essentially screened , and hence are ignored here ( as well as in our preliminary communication where a small part of our results were presented @xcite ) from the outset .",
    "while the kratky - porod worm - like - chain ( wlc ) model has been found to be grossly inadequate to describe a semiflexible chain in 2d , vast amounts of analytical and numerical work have been accumulated using the wlc model as the starting point  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental results of confined biopolymers on a 2d substrate are also analyzed using the well known results of wlc model  @xcite .",
    "therefore , in the following section we summarize the main results of the wlc model which we will revisit in the subsequent sections to compare our simulation results .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in the next section",

    "however , the langevin theories for the wlc chain did not describe this regime .",
    "we first develop the scaling description for the dynamics of a two dimensional semiflexible chain in the free draining limit .",
    "the free draining limit is of particular interest in 2d because it often satisfies the experimental conditions , such as dna confined in a 2d substrate where the effect of hydrodynamics is negligible . for a wlc",

    "<S> we present a unified scaling description for the dynamics of monomers of a semiflexible chain under good solvent condition in the free draining limit . </S>",
    "<S> we consider both the cases where the contour length @xmath0 is comparable to the persistence length @xmath1 and the case @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our theory captures the early time monomer dynamics of a stiff chain characterized by @xmath3 dependence for the mean square displacement(msd ) of the monomers , but predicts a first crossover to the rouse regime of @xmath4 for @xmath5 , and a second crossover to the purely diffusive dynamics for the entire chain at @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we confirm the predictions of this scaling description by studying monomer dynamics of dilute solution of semi - flexible chains under good solvent conditions obtained from our brownian dynamics ( bd ) simulation studies for a large choice of chain lengths with number of monomers per chain n = 16 - 2048 and persistence length @xmath7 lennard - jones ( lj ) units . </S>",
    "<S> these bd simulation results further confirm the absence of gaussian regime for a 2d swollen chain from the slope of the plot of @xmath8 which around @xmath9 changes suddenly from @xmath10 , also manifested in the power law decay for the bond autocorrelation function disproving the validity of the wlc in 2d . </S>",
    "<S> we further observe that the normalized transverse fluctuations of the semiflexible chains for different stiffness @xmath11 as a function of renormalized contour length @xmath12 collapse on the same master plot and exhibits power law scaling @xmath13 at extreme limits , where @xmath14 for extremely stiff chains ( @xmath15 ) , and @xmath16 for fully flexible chains . finally , we compare the radial distribution functions obtained from our simulation studies with those obtained analytically . </S>"
