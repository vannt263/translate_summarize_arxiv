    "inflation is nowadays accepted as a cornerstone of modern cosmology and in particular its simplest realization in terms of single scalar field slow - rolling in its potential appears to match with cosmological observations at cmb scales . during inflation , quantum fluctuations of the inflaton field and of the metric",
    "are stretched on macroscopic scales by the exponential expansion .",
    "this mechanism naturally provides an explanation to the anisotropies in the cmb and it is also expected to generate a background of primordial gws . because of the weakness of their interactions , gws are practically freely traveling through the universe and thus they can provide precise information on times as early as inflation . as a consequence the detection of this primordial gw background at direct gw detectors would deepen our understanding of the physics of the early universe . unfortunately , the spectrum of gws produced during slow - roll inflation lies below the range of current and upcoming direct gw detectors .",
    "while this minimal setup is both simple and effective , it is not completely satisfactory from a theoretical point of view . for this reason , several generalized landscape ( such as multifields models or models with non - standard kinetic terms )",
    "have been proposed in order to define a realistic model of inflation that is also consistent with our knowledge of the fundamental interactions . in this contribution",
    "we discuss a realization of inflation where the inflaton @xmath0 ( which is considered to be a pseudo - scalar ) is coupled to some abelian gauge fields through a generic higher - dimensional coupling  @xcite @xmath1 ( where @xmath2 is the usual field strength tensor and @xmath3 is the dual field strength tensor ) .",
    "remarkably , this term generates an instability , which leads to an exponential production of the gauge fields  @xcite . as a consequence ,",
    "the gauge fields produced with this mechanism induce a back - reaction both on the background dynamics  @xcite and on the perturbations  @xcite ( both the scalar and tensor power spectra are exponentially enhanced at small scales ) .",
    "this generalized framework leads to a wide set of observational consequences such as : the production of a gw background which can be observed at gw interferometers such as advanced ligo / virgo and lisa  @xcite , the presence of a non - gaussian component in the scalar power spectrum  @xcite , the generation of a distribution of pbhs  @xcite and the generation of @xmath4-distortions  @xcite .    in this contribution",
    ", we discuss the shape of the scalar and tensor spectra that are generated in this generalized framework .",
    "in particular we show that because of the exponential enhancement of the tensor spectrum at small scales , gw interferometers may be used to probe different inflationary models . the analysis presented in this contribution",
    "is carried out by grouping models into universality classes  @xcite . as this characterization",
    "is based only on the asymptotic properties of the potential , it leads to a more general description of the problem .",
    "the results presented in this proceeding are based on work with valerie domcke and pierre bintruy  @xcite .",
    "we consider the action  @xcite for a pseudo - scalar inflaton @xmath0 coupled to a certain number @xmath5 of abelian gauge fields @xmath6 associated to some @xmath7 gauge symmetries : @xmath8\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath9  gev denotes the reduced planck mass , @xmath10 is the scalar potential , @xmath11 is the usual field - strength tensor , @xmath12 is the dual field - strength tensor , @xmath13 is a mass scale ( that suppresses the higher - dimensional scalar - vector coupling ) and @xmath14 are the dimensionless coupling constants of the abelian gauge fields . in the following we consider @xmath15 for all @xmath16 .",
    "the equations of motion which describe the classical evolution of @xmath0 and @xmath17 read : @xmath18 where dots are used to denote derivatives with respect to cosmic time @xmath19 , @xmath20 is the conformal time defined as @xmath21 , the brackets @xmath22 denote a spatial mean and the vectors @xmath23 and @xmath24 are the `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' fields defined as : @xmath25 as we show in the following , assuming @xmath26 to be slowly varying ( that indeed is satisfied during slow - roll inflation ) , the equation of motion for @xmath17 can be solved analytically .",
    "once this solution is found , we can plug it into the equation of motion for @xmath27 and study the back - reaction . by performing a spatial fourier transform ,",
    "the equation of motion for the gauge fields reads : @xmath28\\tilde{a}^{a}_{\\pm}(\\tau,\\vec{k } ) =   \\ 0 \\ , \\ ] ] where , given the two helicity modes @xmath29 , we have defined @xmath30 as @xmath31 and we have introduced the dimensionless parameter @xmath32 defined by @xmath33 . for slowly varying @xmath32 this equation describes a tachyonic instability in the @xmath34 mode that induces an exponential growth for modes at low @xmath35 . in particular , the mode @xmath36 can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath37 at this point it is interesting to notice that @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 is the first slow - roll parameter @xmath40 ) . as we have @xmath41 at cmb scales and @xmath42 at the end of inflation , we may have a negligible gauge field production at cmb scales ( consistently with cmb observations ) and a strong production towards the end of inflation .",
    "the back - reaction on the equation of motion for @xmath0 is given by @xmath43 .",
    "this term plays the role of an additional friction term that does not effect the evolution at cmb scales ( where @xmath44 ) but it strongly affects the last part of the evolution .",
    "it is important to stress that , by modifying the background dynamics , this mechanism affects the standard inflationary predictions  @xcite .",
    "in particular the predicted value of scalar spectral index @xmath45 gets increased and the predicted value of the tensor - to - scalar ration @xmath46 gets decreased with respect to the case with @xmath47 .    as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ introduction ] , the strong production of gauge fields is not only affecting the background evolution but it is also modifying the scalar and tensor power spectra .",
    "in particular , the presence of the gauge fields induces a source term in the equation of motion for perturbations leading to an additional contribution to the spectra .",
    "let us start by considering the expression for the scalar power spectrum  @xcite : @xmath48 where we have defined @xmath49 .",
    "as @xmath50 ( @xmath51 is the value of @xmath52 for @xmath53 ) , it is possible to show that for large values of @xmath32 ( _ i.e. _ at small scales ) we get : @xmath54 interestingly , with a proper choice of the parameters of the model , we recover the usual scale - invariant power spectrum of inflation at large scales ( _ i.e. _ scales probed through cmb observations ) and a nearly flat spectrum at small scales .",
    "the strong amplification of the scalar spectrum at small scales may lead to the generation of a distribution of massive pbhs  @xcite .",
    "the normalized density of gws at present time can be expressed as  @xcite : @xmath55 where @xmath56 denotes the radiation energy density today . before concluding this section it is crucial to stress that the contribution of one of the two modes of the gws is suppressed by a @xmath57 factor with respect to the other . as a consequence",
    "the new contribution to the gw spectrum is strongly chiral .",
    "this is a peculiar characteristic of this model and it offers a method to distinguish this signal from other gw backgrounds .",
    "while in the existing literature  @xcite these models have always been studied by assuming a chaotic potential  @xcite @xmath58 for the inflaton , in this contribution ( following the analysis of  @xcite ) we extend the analysis to a broader class of models . for this purpose it is useful to notice that a large set of single - field slow - roll models can be expressed in terms of the parametrization  @xcite : @xmath59 where @xmath60 denotes the number of e - foldings from the end of inflation , @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants .",
    "it is important to stress that using this parametrization we are not completely specifying the potential @xmath10 but only its asymptotic expression .",
    "as a single asymptotic behavior can be reached by several models , with this parametrization we can produce an analysis that does not holds for single models but rather for sets of theories that share a single asymptotic behavior _",
    "i.e. _ for universality classes of models .    by noticing that the parameter @xmath32 that controls",
    "the instability is proportional to the square root of the first slow - roll parameter @xmath39 , we can thus conclude that it is particularly convenient to use the parametrization of eq .   to produce a general analysis of the model introduced in sec .",
    "[ pseudoscalar ] . indeed",
    "( as explained in  @xcite ) using the parametrization of eq .",
    "we have direct control on all the parameters that affect the shape of the scalar and tensor spectra _ i.e. _ @xmath5 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 ( normalization of the potential ) .",
    "this allows for the definition of a systematic method to scan the parameter space and to identify the different classes of models .      +    the models shown in fig .  [ figure1 ]",
    "are : chaotic inflation  @xcite ( @xmath67 ) , starobinsky - like inflation  @xcite ( @xmath68 ) and two implementations of hilltop inflation  @xcite ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "for all the universality classes shown in this plots we have fixed @xmath70 . consistently with the @xmath71-dependence expressed by the parametrization of eq .  ,",
    "by increasing the value of @xmath65 we get a smaller value of @xmath32 at cmb scales and a larger value at the end of inflation ( implying a steeper increase ) .",
    "this explains the steeper increase in the spectra for models with large values of @xmath65 ( see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] ) . in order to be consistent with the constraints set by cmb observations  @xcite the potential @xmath66",
    "is fixed in order to respect the cobe normalization that fixes the amplitude of the scalar spectrum at cmb scales . at a given value for @xmath65 ( which specifies the different universality classes of inflation )",
    "we are thus left with only two parameters _ i.e. _ @xmath63 and @xmath64 .",
    "the parameter @xmath63 controls the strength of the interactions between the inflaton and the gauge fields . as a consequence by increasing @xmath63",
    ", the gauge field production gets faster and the enhancement of the spectrum is shifted at earlier times ( _ i.e. _ larger frequencies ) .",
    "conversely , by varying the parameter @xmath64 , we change the vacuum amplitude of the tensor spectrum .",
    "in particular , by the increasing the value of @xmath64 we `` vertically '' shift the gw spectra . the parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 for the models shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] are chosen in order to maximize the gw spectrum while obeying the cmb constraints  @xcite .",
    "for example the late rise in both the scalar and tensor spectra for the hilltop models ( @xmath69 ) , is due to the constraints on @xmath45 scalar spectral index and thus larger values of @xmath65 implies smaller values for @xmath45 . as already mentioned in sec .",
    "[ pseudoscalar ] , the presence of gauge fields effectively reduces the value of @xmath45 and thus cmb measurements  @xcite set a rather severe constraint on the values of @xmath63 that are allowed for these models . ] .    by observing the plot of the scalar spectra ( where the amplitude of the spectrum at cmb scales is fixed )",
    "we can see that a larger value for @xmath65 implies a smaller amplitude at small scales ( towards the end of inflation ) .",
    "such a behavior is consistent with the analytical prediction given in eq .  .",
    "notice that all the models shown in this plot are in tension ( by a @xmath72 factor ) with the estimate of the pbh bound  @xcite .",
    "this discrepancy can be eased by taking into account the theoretical uncertainties in the derivation of the pbh bound .",
    "moreover , by considering models with @xmath73 it is possible to produce a gw background that can be observed at upcoming direct gw detectors , while respecting this bound  @xcite .",
    "for tensor spectra we can see that larger values of @xmath65 imply a suppression of the amplitude at cmb scales but also a steeper increase of the spectrum towards higher frequencies .",
    "it is interesting to notice that the tensor spectra are approaching a nearly universal value in the strong gauge field regime . as discussed in  @xcite ,",
    "this behavior can be explained on solid grounds using the condition @xmath74 at the end of inflation .",
    "in particular this condition can be used to impose an absolute upper bound on the gw spectrum @xmath75 : @xmath76 given the weakness of the assumptions to derive this bound ( @xmath74 at the end of inflation ) , in practice it can be seen as model independent .        as from the point of view of potential observations starobinsky - like models ( @xmath68 )",
    "appears to be the most promising among the universality classes shown in fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] , we proceed by restricting our analysis to this particular class . in particular , in fig .  [",
    "fig : sidecap ] we show a scan plot for the parameters of these models that correspond to : @xmath77 ^ 2 \\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath78 .",
    "interestingly this plot shows a complementarity between cmb measurements and gw interferometers .",
    "different measurements are starting to probe the viable parameter space of these models from different directions : while searches for non - gaussianities in the cmb and direct gw detection probe the region of large @xmath63 , searches for gws in the cmb constraints the small @xmath79 region .",
    "the general higher - dimensional coupling between a pseudo - scalar inflaton and some abelian gauge fields induces a tachyonic instability that leads to an exponential production of gauge fields during inflation .",
    "the strong production of these gauge fields back - reacts on the system and introduces an additional friction term that affects the last part of inflation . in general",
    "this affects the standard inflationary predictions for a given model by decreasing the predicted value of @xmath45 and increasing @xmath46 .",
    "the exponential production of gauge fields also leads to a modification of the equation of motion for scalar and tensor perturbations .",
    "in particular it gives rise to a strong enhancement of the scalar and tensor power spectra at high frequencies ( small scales ) .",
    "this mechanism may lead to the generation of a distribution of massive pbhs which contribute to the fraction of dark matter present in the universe  @xcite and to the production of chiral primordial gws that can be observed at direct gws detectors .",
    "the complementarity between different measurements provide a powerful method to probe these models .",
    "moreover , as direct gws detectors may access a very wide range of frequencies , they can potentially distinguish between different universality classes .",
    "such a measurement would provide precious information on the microphysics of inflation .",
