    "recent developments in superconducting magnet design may make it possible to upgrade the fermilab tevatron collider at moderate cost by replacing its ring of 4 tesla dipole magnets by 12 tesla dipoles@xcite .",
    "this tripler design would yield proton - antiproton colliding beams at a center of mass energy @xmath8  tev and a luminosity about @xmath9 , which could significantly enhance the potential for new particle discoveries at the tevatron .",
    "the physics justification for the tripler requires detailed benchmark studies and comparison with the lhc potential , since the lhc is expected to become operational on a similar time - line as the tripler . in this letter we present benchmark results for discovery of the higgs boson in the standard model ( sm ) , the trilepton and same - sign dilepton signals of supersymmetric ( susy ) particles , extra @xmath5-bosons and contact interactions .",
    "the interesting range for the sm higgs boson mass is 102.6 gev @xmath10 550 gev ; the lower value is the current lep 2 experimental limit @xcite ; the upper value is due to the requirement of a non - trivial and consistent effective theory@xcite .",
    "lattice calculations give a mass bound of @xmath11 gev @xcite .",
    "electroweak precision data favor @xmath12 gev at 95% c.l .",
    "@xcite . the lightest higgs scalar in minimal supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is predicted to have a mass less than 130 gev @xcite and our sm analysis applies equally to it in the decoupling limit @xcite .",
    "naturalness considerations in the minimal supergravity ( sugra ) model lead to an upper bound on the lighter chargino mass of @xmath13 400 gev @xcite .",
    "we show below that the tevatron tripler with @xmath14 fb@xmath1 would provide at least a 5@xmath2 discovery for the sm higgs boson up to @xmath15 gev and for the lighter chargino up to @xmath16 gev .",
    "the tevatron tripler has great potential for the standard model higgs boson search . in fig .",
    "[ fig : higgs](a ) we show the fusion cross section from @xmath17 as well as @xmath18 , and the associated production @xmath19 at @xmath8  tev , where @xmath20 . for comparison",
    ", we also show the cross sections at the tevatron run ii ( @xmath21 2  tev ) and the lhc for some representative higgs boson masses .",
    "the scale on the right - hand side gives expected number of events for @xmath22 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity .",
    "we see that the total cross sections for higgs production are increased by about an order of magnitude at the tripler compared to the tevatron run ii . as a remark ,",
    "if the tripler is running at the @xmath23 mode , the @xmath24 cross section would not change ; that for @xmath25 would be reduced by about 10% and that for @xmath26 by about 25% .",
    "= 4.0 in    for a higgs boson mass @xmath27 gev , it is known that the leading signal at the tevatron is @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "however , this channel becomes less accessible at the lhc because of the much larger qcd background .",
    "we studied this process at the tripler and found that it is a useful channel to reach 5@xmath2 significance for @xmath29 gev with a luminosity of less than 8 fb@xmath1 .    for the intermediate range mass higgs boson ( @xmath30 gev ) ,",
    "the most important discovery channel is the signal of dileptons along with missing transeverse energy ( @xmath31 ) through the process @xmath32 ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) .",
    "the leading background is @xmath35 production .",
    "we impose kinematic cuts similar to those in @xcite and find that this mode has a 5@xmath2 statistical significance reach for @xmath36 gev ( assuming @xmath37 20 fb@xmath1 ) . in comparison , at the tevatron run",
    "ii with @xmath38  fb@xmath1 , a @xmath39 significance can be reached only at the narrow mass range near @xmath40  gev @xcite .",
    "when @xmath41 , the `` gold - plated '' channel @xmath42 becomes interesting .",
    "after the basic acceptance cuts and a search for a peak in the four - lepton invariant mass distribution , this channel has a good signal to background ratio , @xmath43 ; for example , with @xmath44 gev , the signal and background cross sections are 1.2 fb and 1.5 fb , respectively .    for a still larger higgs boson mass ,",
    "the `` silver - plated '' channel @xmath45 is more useful since its rate is 6 times larger than the @xmath46 rate , although higgs boson mass reconstruction is more difficult because of the missing neutrinos .",
    "the irreducible background is @xmath47 production .",
    "after suitable cuts on @xmath48 and the @xmath49 cluster transverse mass , we find the 5@xmath2 discovery reach for @xmath50 is about 500 gev for @xmath51 20 fb@xmath1 .    for a higgs boson mass @xmath52 gev , the @xmath53 channel can also be used .",
    "the leading background is the @xmath54 qcd process .",
    "we find that 5@xmath2 discovery reach of this channel can be achieved for @xmath55 gev for @xmath56 fb@xmath1 .    in fig .",

    "we note that further improvement of the reach at the tripler is possible by optimizing acceptance cuts and by including the @xmath62 channel as well as channels involving tau - leptons in the final states . to summarize",
    ", the tevatron tripler offers a tremendous opportunity to discover the sm higgs boson over the mass range from the current bound to @xmath63 gev , for @xmath51 20 ( 40 ) fb@xmath1 .",
    "a large number of production processes for supersymmetric particles have been experimentally investigated at the tevatron , yielding lower mass limits for strongly interacting gluinos ,    squarks , especially stops , and weakly interacting sleptons and neutralinos / charginos @xcite .",
    "the signals of supersymmetric particles are trileptons from chargino / neutralino pairs , same - sign dileptons from gluino pairs and missing transverse energy carried by the lightest neutralino .    figure  [ fg : prospino ] shows that the tripler cross sections are considerably larger than those for the tevatron run ii @xcite .",
    "the gluon fusion contribution to susy particle production at @xmath21 5.4 gev is more important than that of quark - antiquark annihilation .",
    "the fractions of susy particle production from incoming gluons at the given sugra point are @xmath64 for stops and @xmath65 for gluino pairs at the tripler , while they are only @xmath66 and @xmath67 for run ii .",
    "this affects the @xmath68 factors due to susy - qcd corrections through the larger color charge of the radiating incoming partons .",
    "= 4.5 in    to assess the discovery potential of the tripler in searching for susy particles , we present results from simulations for the trilepton and the same sign dilepton ( ss2l ) signals with an event generator and a simple calorimeter including our acceptance cuts . the isajet 7.40 event generator program @xcite with the parton distribution functions of cteq3l @xcite is employed to calculate the trilepton ( @xmath69 ) and the same sign dilepton ( ss2l ) signals from all possible sources of susy particles .",
    "the backgrounds from @xmath70 is calculated with isajet as well .    the trilepton signature with missing transverse",

    "the major source of trileptons is the associated production and decay of the lighter chargino ( @xmath72 ) and the second lightest neutralino ( @xmath73 ) @xcite . at the tripler , gluinos and squarks",
    "can be the dominant source of trileptons and same - sign dileptons along with jets in the final states , while @xmath74 , and the slepton pair production processes @xmath75 , and @xmath76 generate clean trilepton events .",
    "requiring @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 , and applying other acceptance cuts @xcite , we find that the major sm backgrounds are ( i ) @xmath79 or @xmath80 ( @xmath33 or @xmath34 ) ( ii ) @xmath81 or @xmath82 and subsequent @xmath83 leptonic decays , with one or both gauge bosons being virtual .",
    "we employed the programs madgraph @xcite and helas @xcite to evaluate the background cross section of @xmath84 for contributions from all these subprocesses .",
    "additional backgrounds come from production of @xmath70 and @xmath85 @xcite . at the tripler with 20 fb@xmath1 integrated luminosity",
    ", we expect about 36 background events ; a @xmath86 signal would have 30 events .",
    "if the tripler runs with @xmath23 collisions , the major trilepton background cross section will be reduced by about 35% and the susy trilepton signal cross section will be reduced by about 18% , 27% , 55% and 59% for @xmath87 140 , 200 , 300 and 460 gev , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig : susy](a ) presents the cross sections at the tripler for trileptons with jets and for _ clean _ trileptons with 0 or 1 jet at the tripler versus @xmath88 , for @xmath89 , @xmath90 gev , and @xmath91 .",
    "also shown is the cross section for a 5@xmath2 signal with @xmath14 fb@xmath1 .",
    "the trilepton signal will be observable up to @xmath92 gev ( @xmath93 380 gev , @xmath94 1.1 tev ) with @xmath14 fb@xmath1 , which is a great improvement from the tevatron run ii reach of @xmath95 260 gev ( @xmath96 gev , @xmath94 600 gev ) with @xmath38 fb@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "= 3.4 in    same - sign dileptons with missing energy ( ss2l ) is another promising channel to search for supersymmetry @xcite .",
    "the cross section of the sm background in this channel is very small after suitable cuts .",
    "there are several major sources of the ss2l signal : ( i ) @xmath97 production , where @xmath98 and @xmath99 ; these can test the majorana property of the gluinos if @xmath100 . (",
    "ii ) @xmath101 ; ( iii ) @xmath102 ; ( iv ) @xmath103 where @xmath104 ; and ( v ) trilepton events where one of the leptons is lost .    for same - sign dilepton events having @xmath105 gev [ @xmath106 ( 20 ) gev for the tevatron ( lhc ) ] and @xmath107 , we require at least two jets as well as the same isolation and missing energy as in the trilepton analysis .",
    "the major sm backgrounds are ( i ) @xmath108 , ( ii ) @xmath70 and ( iii ) @xmath47 . the contributions from @xmath35 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 are negligible after cuts @xcite . with @xmath56 fb@xmath1 at the tripler , we expect about 14 background events ; a @xmath86 signal would have 19 events . in @xmath23 collisions at @xmath21 5.4 gev ,",
    "the major same - sign dilepton background cross section from @xmath108 will be reduced by about 30% and the susy same - sign dilepton signal cross section will be about the same as that in @xmath111 collisions .    in fig .",
    "3(b ) , we present the cross sections after cuts versus @xmath88 , for same - sign dileptons with @xmath89 , @xmath90 gev , and @xmath91 .",
    "this signal is observable up to @xmath112 gev ( @xmath113 gev , @xmath114 gev ) with @xmath56 fb@xmath1 , and can be improved up to @xmath115 gev ( @xmath116 gev , @xmath117 gev ) with @xmath14 fb@xmath1 .",
    "other susy signals from single lepton+@xmath48 and @xmath48+jets , which are promising at the lhc @xcite , may also be useful at the tripler .",
    "many sources of new physics at high scales can be parameterized by four - fermion contact interactions @xcite , @xmath118 where @xmath119 and @xmath120 is the typical energy scale at which the new physics sets in .",
    "the drell - yan process of lepton pair production at hadron colliders is a powerful tool to probe the contact scale of new physics contributions @xcite . in this process",
    "the contact terms interfere with @xmath121 and @xmath5 exchanges , yielding multi - tev sensitivities to contact scales @xmath120 . the 95% c.l .",
    "lower limits on @xmath122 contact scales that can be set are @xmath123 the comparative reach for other contact terms is similar . with @xmath14 fb@xmath1 at the tripler , contact interactions from new physics with a mass scale @xmath7  tev could be excluded at 95% c.l .",
    "additional @xmath5-bosons are a generic feature of gauge symmetries larger than the sm .",
    "we consider two interesting models with extra @xmath5 bosons : ( i ) @xmath124 in @xmath125 , and ( ii ) @xmath126 in the sequential standard model , with sm coupling strength to quarks and leptons while couplings to @xmath127 and @xmath5 bosons are suppressed .",
    "the interactions of the extra @xmath5 bosons with fermions are given by @xcite @xmath128 where @xmath129 , @xmath130 , and @xmath131 .",
    "in the sequential standard model , the coupling constant in eq .",
    "( 3 ) is replaced by @xmath132 and @xmath133 are the same couplings as those of the sm @xmath5 boson .",
    "we find that the 5@xmath2 reach limits are @xmath134 the energies and luminosities of the colliders are the same as those in eq .",
    "( [ eq : contact ] ) .",
    "thus , the tripler would more than double the @xmath124 reach of the tevatron and have about half the reach of the lhc .",
    "our analyses of physics benchmarks show that the tripler offers robust opportunities for the exploration of new physics .",
    "this is dramatically the case for the sm higgs sector where we find that with 40  fb@xmath1 , a @xmath39 discovery can be made up to a higgs mass of 680  gev , thus covering the theoretical interesting mass range for the sm higgs boson . in particular , a luminosity of 30  fb@xmath1 would lead to more than 10@xmath2 signal significance for @xmath135 gev via the gauge coupling channels @xmath136 and @xmath60 , directly probing the coupling of the gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "supersymmetry searches at the tripler via trileptons would extend up to a chargino mass @xmath137  gev , which is close to the naturalness upper bound .",
    "the scale of contact interactions can be pushed by more than 20  tev above the expected reach of the tevatron and extra @xmath5 bosons could be discovered up to a mass 2.6  tev .",
    "our comparisons of the tripler and lhc shows that although the lhc has a greater new physics discovery reach in most channels , the tripler can cover the interesting mass range for the sm higgs and also offers coverage for most of the lighter chargino mass range expected from naturalness considerations .",
    "thus , for the higgs and chargino benchmarks both the tripler and lhc may offer comparable physics opportunities .",
