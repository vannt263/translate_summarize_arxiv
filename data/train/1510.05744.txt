    "there are two major techniques used to preserve a spin - polarized ground state of alkali atoms in a glass cell .",
    "the first is to fill the cell with an inert buffer gas .",
    "the second is to cover the inner glass surfaces with a so - called anti - relaxation coating .",
    "the interaction of the anti - relaxation coating with alkali atoms is much weaker than that of the bare glass surface , which causes the alkali atoms to bounce many times without relaxation of spin polarization .",
    "paraffin , one of the most widely used anti - relaxation coating materials , can bounce alkali atoms up to 10  000 times before wall - induced relaxation@xcite .",
    "buffer - gas - free anti - relaxation - coated cells have a number of advantages over buffer - gas cells : the broadening of magnetic resonance lines due to field inhomogeneity can be reduced because alkali atoms sample the entire volume of the cell , and also it is possible to polarize and detect alkali atoms more effectively because there is no pressure broadening of the optical resonance line .",
    "buffer - gas - free anti - relaxation - coated cells have therefore been used in many applications , including atomic clocks@xcite , ultra - sensitive magnetometry@xcite , quantum memory@xcite , and studies of light propagation@xcite . in these experiments ,",
    "the background gas pressure is thought to be low enough to ignore collisions between alkali atoms and the background gas .",
    "however , the high reactivity of alkali atoms would lead to the generation of additional gases by chemical reactions .",
    "are the coated cells really `` buffer - gas - free '' in the sense that alkali atoms travel freely between the walls ?",
    "in fact , outgassing in paraffin coated cells has been concerned@xcite and chemical reactions of alkali atoms with silicon compound coatings and resulting outgassing have been reported@xcite .",
    "if the background gas pressure is too high for alkali atoms to travel freely between the walls , the influences of the collisions should be taken into account .",
    "for example , collisions between cesium atoms and hydrogen molecules , which are typical species of the background gas@xcite , shift the ground state hyperfine transition frequency by 14  hz / pa@xcite at 30@xmath3c .",
    "this shift may be problematic in atomic clock applications , considering the frequency shift induced by inner surfaces of a coated cell is on the order of a hundred hz@xcite .",
    "however , background gas pressures in buffer - gas - free cells have not been reported except for a very high pressure ( @xmath4  pa ) background gas in a microfabricated cell with an octadecyltrichlorosilane coating@xcite .    in situ pressure measurement without breaking the cell makes it possible to track the history of the pressure over the heating process , sometimes called `` ripening , '' which may accelerate chemical reactions .",
    "ripening is generally performed on coated cells before experiments to increase alkali vapor density@xcite , because the initial alkali vapor density is much lower than its saturation vapor density .",
    "it has been reported that ripening improves anti - relaxation performance@xcite , although there are concerns that ripening may simply reduce the collision rate of atoms with the cell surface by increasing the background gas pressure@xcite .    here",
    ", we report a simple and effective method for measuring the rate of velocity - changing collisions ( vccs ) between alkali atoms and background gas without breaking the cell when the gas pressure is low enough not to cause pressure broadening . the background gas pressure and mean free path of alkali atoms can be estimated from the measured vcc rate .",
    "this measurement was demonstrated in rubidium ( rb ) vapor cells with a paraffin coating .",
    "we found that the vcc rates were higher than a few @xmath5  s@xmath1 .",
    "the mean free path of rb atoms and the background gas pressure were estimated to be a few mm and several pa , respectively .",
    "in addition , by measuring the vcc rates before and after ripening , we found that ripening increased the background gas pressure .",
    "the spin - relaxation times were also measured before and after ripening , and the number of bounces before relaxation was evaluated . we found that ripening increased the number of bounces .",
    "our method to measure the vcc rate @xmath6 is based on velocity - selective optical pumping and vcc - induced redistribution of the velocity of spin - polarized alkali atoms .",
    "a resonant , circularly polarized pump laser pulse selectively polarizes alkali atoms whose velocity components @xmath7 along the laser propagation direction ( the @xmath8 direction ) lie within a narrow velocity distribution centered at @xmath9 .",
    "the pump pulse irradiates alkali atoms for only a short duration .",
    "spin polarization is detected with a counterpropagating collinear probe laser beam ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : concept]a ) .",
    "the diameter of the probe beam is much larger than that of the pump beam .",
    "a similar optical configuration has been adopted to measure diffusion coefficients@xcite .",
    "the signal @xmath10 measured with the probe beam indicates the polarization of atoms with @xmath11 in the probe beam region and decreases with time @xmath12 due to two different mechanisms .",
    "first , the ballistic escape of the polarized atoms from the probe beam region decreases @xmath10 .",
    "second , the vccs between alkali atoms and the background gas causes a decrease in @xmath10 , as the vccs redistribute the atomic velocity of the polarized atoms toward the maxwell - boltzmann distribution , resulting in fewer atoms within a probed velocity range ( fig .",
    "[ fig : concept]b ) .",
    "the signal @xmath10 is thus described by @xmath13 where the contributions of the ballistic escape and the vccs are denoted as @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively .",
    "detailed discussions about @xmath14 and @xmath15 will be provided in sec .",
    "[ sec : analysis ] .",
    "measurement of the vcc rate was carried out for paraffin - coated rb vapor cells at room temperature , the fabrication procedure of which will be described in sec .  [",
    "sec : experiment ] .",
    "a longitudinal magnetic field of 40  @xmath16 t was applied to the vapor cell with helmholtz coils in a permalloy magnetic shield .",
    "the frequencies of the pump and the probe beams were stabilized to the @xmath17 transition frequency of the @xmath18rb @xmath19 line .",
    "the profiles of the beams were measured with a cmos camera and fitted by gaussian functions .",
    "the diameters of the probe and the pump beams at which their intensities were reduced by @xmath20 compared to the beam center intensity were 0.38  cm and 0.053  cm , respectively .",
    "the probe beam power was 10  @xmath16w , and the pump beam power was 0.3  mw .",
    "the pump pulse has a finite duration @xmath21 , and @xmath21 must be much longer than the lifetime of the rb @xmath19 line to polarize rb atoms . at the same time , @xmath21 should not be much longer than the typical time constants of the atoms ballistic escape and the decrease in @xmath10 due to the vccs . in this experiment , the pump beam irradiated the cell for 1  @xmath16s , and was then shut off with an acousto - optic modulator at @xmath22 .",
    "measurements were performed for the left- and right - circularly polarized probe beams , and the signal @xmath10 was derived from the difference between the transmitted powers for the two polarizations .",
    "experimental data for an uncoated cell and a paraffin - coated cell are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : uncoatedcell ] by blue and red points , respectively .",
    "it is clear that the decrease in signal @xmath10 for the paraffin - coated cell was more rapid than that for the uncoated cell . the paraffin - coated cell ,",
    "therefore , contained more background gas than the uncoated cell . to derive the vcc rate",
    ", we simulated the signal @xmath10 with the following model .",
    "first , we considered the contribution @xmath14 of the ballistic escape to the signal @xmath10 . the polarized atoms velocity component @xmath23 perpendicular to the beams obeys the maxwell - boltzmann distribution . for simplicity",
    ", we assumed that the pump beam diameter was infinitely small and atoms were polarized at the center of the probe beam at @xmath22 .",
    "the probability @xmath24 that a polarized atom has a velocity between @xmath23 and @xmath25 was yielded as @xmath26 where the most probable speed @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 with the boltzmann constant @xmath29 , the absolute temperature @xmath30 , and the atomic mass @xmath31 .",
    "the polarized atoms move at a constant velocity during the ballistic escape .",
    "hence , the probability @xmath32 that a polarized atom is at a distance from the center between @xmath33 and @xmath34 at time @xmath12 was derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq : boltzmanndis ] ) as @xmath35    as the optical depths of the vapor cells were much smaller than unity at room temperature , the signal is proportional to the product of @xmath36 and the intensity of the probe beam at the position of a polarized atom : @xmath37 here , the beam profile @xmath38 of the probe beam was described by a gaussian function @xmath39 where the probe beam diameter @xmath40  cm , as mentioned above . by substituting eqs .",

    "the probe beam detects the polarization within the velocity distribution @xmath46 , which is proportional to the absorption cross - section for the probe beam .",
    "the signal detected with the probe beam is proportional to the integral of the product of @xmath43 and @xmath46 over the velocity @xmath7 , @xmath47 we assumed the time variation of @xmath43 as @xmath48 , \\label{eq : redistribution}\\ ] ] where the steady - state velocity distribution @xmath49 was given by @xmath50 we then calculated @xmath15 from eqs .",

    "@xmath16s , the experimental data were compared with @xmath52 .",
