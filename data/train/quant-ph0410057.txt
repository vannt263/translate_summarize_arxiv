    "the attractive theoretical possibility of obtaining the repulsive casimir force between ( planar ) magnetodielectrics @xcite can hardly be realized at micron and submicron distances because there is no natural medium with permeability different from unity in the relevant frequency range @xcite .",
    "therefore , as follows from the lifshitz theory@xcite , the casimir force should always be attractive at distances exploited in modern experiments and applications @xcite .",
    "however , it has ( also ) been conjectured that for media with nontrivial magnetic properties the contributions from the low - frequency side of the spectrum , where permeability dominates permittivity , may still lead to the repulsive total force @xcite .",
    "in other words , to obtain the casimir force properly , it is necessary to account for the medium dispersion over the entire spectrum and not only in the @xmath0 range @xcite . in view of important potential applications in the development of micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems @xcite and nanotechnology in general @xcite , it seems therefore worthwhile to consider the effect of the medium dispersion on the casimir force between magnetodielectrics in more detail .",
    "the aim of this work is to reconsider the statements made in refs . @xcite and @xcite by analysing the attractive / repulsive casimir force at zero temperature in a very simple metal - magnetodieletric system and accounting for the medium dispersion .",
    "however , in order to rigorously provide an alternative ( and more familiar ) result for the casimir force to that given in ref .",
    "@xcite , we first extend the theory of the casimir effect between absorbing dielectric multilayers @xcite to magnetodielectric systems .",
    "consider a multilayered system described by permittivity @xmath1 and permeability @xmath2 defined in a stepwise fashion , as depicted in fig",
    ". 1 .    in order to calculate the relevant component of the maxwell stress tensor @xmath3 @xcite @xmath4 we decompose the macroscopic field operators into positive frequency and negative frequency parts according to @xmath5 with the constitutive relations @xcite    [ ce ] @xmath6    they obey the macroscopic maxwell equations of the standard form . here",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the electric and magnetic noise polarization operators , respectively , which obey the commutation rules ( in the dyadic form ) :    [ cr ] @xmath9 = \\frac{\\hbar}{4\\pi^2}\\varepsilon''({\\bf r},\\omega ) { \\bf i}\\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r}')\\delta(\\omega-\\omega'),\\ ] ] @xmath10 = \\frac{\\hbar}{4\\pi^2 } \\frac{\\mu''({\\bf r},\\omega)}{|\\mu({\\bf r},\\omega)|^2 } { \\bf i}\\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r } ' ) \\delta(\\omega-\\omega'),\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the unit dyadic .",
    "therefore , any ( annihilation ) field operator is related to @xmath7 and @xmath12 via the classical green function @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14{\\bf g}({\\bf r},{\\bf r'};\\omega)=4\\pi{\\bf i } \\delta({\\bf r}-{\\bf r ' } ) \\label{gf}\\ ] ] and the outgoing - wave condition at infinity . as a consequence",
    ", all field correlation functions can be expressed through the green function in accordance with the fluctuation - dissipation theorem @xcite .",
    "in particular , for the electric - field correlation function we find @xmath15 and the magnetic - field correlation function is obtained from this expression using @xmath16 .    applying the above results to the @xmath17th layer and taking into account that @xmath18 and @xmath19 are real and that @xmath20 and @xmath21 in this region , for the relevant correlation functions in eq .",

    "the casimir force per unit area @xmath28 between the stacks bounding the @xmath17th layer equals to @xmath3 when omitting its infinite - medium part @xcite .",
    "formally , this is done by replacing the green function in eq .",
    "( [ cf ] ) with its scattering part @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the infinite - medium green function .",

    "( [ f ] ) is also a ( slowly varying ) function of the separation between the slabs .",
    "equations ( [ f ] ) and ( [ rps ] ) are equivalent to eqs .",

    "each slab is therefore described by permittivity and permeability of the drude - lorentz type @xmath64 where @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) measure the coupling strengths between the medium and the electromagnetic field , whereas @xmath67 and @xmath68 are resonant frequencies of the medium and linewidths of the associated resonances , respectively .",

    "the metal is considered a reference medium and characteristic frequencies of the magnetodielectric are scaled with @xmath84 .",

    ", we note that in the case of au ( @xmath86 ev @xcite ) , @xmath87 nm and a similar value is found for other good metals .",

    "note that for this @xmath61 , the figure actually represents the casimir force in units @xmath90",
    "( @xmath91 for au ) .",
    "one observes that the transition from the attractive to repulsive regime occurs roughly when @xmath92 and that the constant - force lines at larger @xmath93 and @xmath94 in the transition region are ( nearly ) straight lines characterized by a ( nearly ) constant ratio @xmath95",
    ". similar behavior , however , in terms of @xmath58 and @xmath59 , is found for the border line between the attractive and repulsive regions in fig .",
    "1a of ref.@xcite",
    ". we also note that our simulation agrees with the conclusion that for large @xmath58 and @xmath59 the sign and the magnitude of the force depend on the surface impedance @xmath96 of the magnetodielectric @xcite .",
    "this can be seen if we rewrite eq .",
    "( [ emu ] ) in terms of the relative quantities @xmath97 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 @xmath100 at large @xmath97 one can disregard unity here , so that @xmath101 . accordingly , ( nearly ) straight lines seen in the ( @xmath102 ) contour plot correspond to constant-@xmath103 lines . since for this separation between the slabs @xmath58 and @xmath59 are strongly dispersive ( note that @xmath104 and @xmath105 ) , one must conclude that accounting for the medium dispersion does not much affect the conclusions drawn in ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the ( @xmath106)-dependence of the force .    clearly , of crucial importance for the appearance of the repulsive force is the relative position of the electric and magnetic resonance of the magnetodielectric .",
    "figure [ qq ] illustrates the variation of @xmath89 with transverse frequencies ( @xmath107 ) of the magnetodielectric while keeping the magnitudes of @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( determined by @xmath97 ) fixed . at large @xmath107",
    "the force tends to a constant value because @xmath108 in eq .",
    "( [ empq ] ) . of course , in the opposite limit , the force vanishes as @xmath109 for small @xmath107 .",
    "it is seen that the appearance and magnitude of the repulsive force is governed by the position of the magnetic resonance for almost all @xmath110 .",
    "note that in the region where @xmath111 , which is normally always the case , the force is attractive at this distance .    since @xmath107 and @xmath112 appear in the form of the product @xmath113 in eq .",
    "( [ empq ] ) , the mismatch between the electric and magnetic resonances can be compensated by properly adjusting @xmath61 and thus one can in principle still observe the repulsive force although at larger distances .",
    "this possibility is illustrated in fig .",
    "one observes that , indeed , even for very small values of @xmath114 ( @xmath115 ) at larger distances there is a repulsive force between the media . to estimate the distance at which the repulsive force could be observed in a ( possibly ) realistic system",
    ", we note that the highest frequencies known so far at which permeabilities differ significantly from unity are ( for some antiferromagnetics ) in the thz range @xcite .",
    "realistic values of the parameters @xmath107 are therefore @xmath116 , corresponding to @xmath117 in the range of optical frequencies , and @xmath118 , corresponding to @xmath119 in the thz range .",
    "the distance dependence of the ( total ) force for these parameters across the repulsive region is presented in fig.[real ] .",
    "as seen , the force is attractive at small distances , which supports claims made in ref @xcite . with increasing @xmath61 ,",
    "however , the effect of permeability is enforced and the force crosses over to the repulsive regime already at @xmath120 ( which is @xmath121 for au ) .",
    "thus , the effect of magnetic polarization appears at distances smaller by two orders of magnitude than it would be expected on the basis of a simple estimate @xmath122 . evidently , this effect is due to the cumulative contribution of the waves from the low - frequency side of the spectrum and is therefore a direct consequence of the medium dispersion at long wavelengths . to estimate the magnitude of the repulsive force at such distances ,",
    "we calculate its largest value occurring at @xmath123 , where we find @xmath124 .",
    "accordingly , the maximal repulsive force between , e.g. au and this hypothetical [ @xmath125 ev , @xmath126 ev , @xmath127 mev , @xmath128 mev , @xmath129 mev , and @xmath130 magnetodielectric is @xmath131 @xmath132 and is observed at the distance @xmath133 .    of course , at higher temperatures the above estimate becomes invalid as at such large separations between the slabs the thermal corrections must be accounted for .",
    "the force at nonzero temperature is formally obtained from eq .",
    "( [ fjf ] ) by letting @xcite @xmath134 and @xmath135 , where @xmath136 are the matsubara frequencies .",
    "one may immediately conclude that the force in the present system is always attractive at room temperature .",
    "indeed , at @xmath137 k and for au , the @xmath63th contribution to the force is governed by the quantity @xmath138 thus , at distances @xmath139 only the @xmath140 term contributes as all other terms are strongly exponentially damped . since for the drude metals @xmath141 @xcite , this term depends only on the dielectric properties of the magnetodielectric and the force is therefore attractive .",
    "we have verified this by directly calculating the force at @xmath137 k and , for example , at @xmath142 , where the zero - temperature force is maximally repulsive , we have obtained @xmath143 @xmath132 .",
    "the validity of the above estimates rests upon the adequacy of the drude ( local ) model for the metal adopted .",
    "this model is often used in the considerations and precise calculations of the casimir force between metals and is generally believed to adequately describe the properties of good metals at low frequencies @xcite .",
    "strictly speaking , however , the electromagnetic response of a metal is nonlocal , at least in the frequency range of the anomalous skin effect , and should therefore be described by the nonlocal reflection coefficients @xmath144 @xcite .",
    "the effect of the metal nonlocality below @xmath145 on the casimir force between two metal ( au ) plates at zero temperature has recently been considered in detail in ref . @xcite and it has been found that anomalous skin effect produces only a minor correction ( below 0.5% for @xmath61 above @xmath146 nm ) to the force calculated using the local description of the metal ( which also agrees with the assertion given in ref .",
    "@xcite ) . moreover , as can be concluded from fig .",
    "@xcite , this correction diminishes and saturates with increasing distance between the plates .",
    "accordingly , accounting for the anomalous skin effect of the metal can not significantly change the above estimates on the repulsive force at @xmath83 k. as follows from the small frequency behaviour of the surface impedances @xcite , since the property @xmath141 holds nonlocally as well , the force at @xmath137 k is , as before , always attractive . however , since also @xmath147 , contrary to the generally accepted @xmath148 , further consideration of the effect of the metal nonlocality on the casimir force at finite temperatures is needed .",
    "we end this short discussion by noting that very recently henkel and joulain reported a similar analysis @xcite , however , paying more attention to the dependence of the force on geometrical rather than on material parameters as we have done . in this respect , these two works are complementary",
    ". as concerns our findings on the distance dependence of the force , these are ( generally ) in agreement with those of henkel and joulain concerning thick media .",
    "using the properties of the macroscopic field operators appropriate for magnetodielectric dissipative systems , we have extended our previous approach to the casimir effect between two dielectric multilayered stacks to magnetodielectric systems .",
    "as expected , the resulting expression for the force between the stacks is of the same form as for a purely dielectric system .",
    "however , the fresnel coefficients are modified owing to the different magnetic properties of the system in the present case . using this result",
    ", we have numerically analysed the effect of the medium dispersion on the casimir force in a metal - magnetodielectric system described by the drude - lorentz permittivities and permeabilities . according to this analysis , taking into account the medium dispersion",
    "does not much affect the conclusions that one may draw from a simple nondispersive model of ref .",
    "@xcite regarding the material dependence of the force .",
    "our simulations also demonstrate that the force at zero temperature in a realistic system is attractive at small distances ( covering the submicron and micron range for good metals ) , which supports statements in ref .",
    "@xcite , and , depending on the magnetic ( dispersion ) properties of the magnetodielectric , becomes repulsive at larger distances .",
    "however , owing to contributions of the low - frequency waves to the force , the crossover occurs at a much smaller distance than expected from the simple @xmath149 estimate . at room temperature , the force on good ( drude ) metals such as au , cu ,",
    "al remains attractive over the entire range of distances .",
