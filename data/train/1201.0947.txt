    "the motion is faster when the dimer sinks without rotating in the @xmath21 plane .",

    "s1a ) , one may observe that intervals of rising @xmath33 , corresponding to a roto - translation of the dimer , last longer in time than the constant @xmath33 , but covers a similar distance in space ",

    "finally , we comment in more detail on theories related to our dynamical transition between the rotor and the phase slip regimes .",
    "firstly , our simplified eqs . ( 3 ) may be seen as a relative of the frenkel - kontorova model , and of related models for the depinning of charge density waves in superconductors .",
    "the original frenkel - kontorova model considers the dynamics of a chain of forced coupled particles in a periodic potential ( more realistic models for charge density wave depinning consider impurities hence an additional random potential ) .",
    "the key result of the simplest model is that there is a transition between pinned and moving particles . just above the critical force , @xmath56 ,",
    "the asymptotic velocity of the particles , @xmath14 , scales as  @xcite : @xmath125 where @xmath34 is the forcing , and @xmath82 is an effective friction .",
    "the velocity therefore may be seen as an order parameter for the dynamical depinning transition , which is a continuous transition in this framework . while in eqs .",
    "( 3 ) in the main text there is a coupling between rotatory and translational motion , the analogue order parameter may be taken as the asymptotic time derivative of the lag angle between the dimer orientation and the local director field , @xmath39 , which we call @xmath63 . via a numerical solution of eqs .",
    "( 3 ) we find that @xmath126 , for @xmath127 , further validating the qualitative similarity hinted at above . in this analogy",
    ", our rotor phase corresponds to the pinned state , and the phase slip phase corresponds to the depinned one .",
    "the critical behaviour appears to be the same , provided the appropriate order parameters are chosen .",
    "secondly , our model bears some similarities with the kuramoto model  @xcite , which is a paradigm to study the synchronisation of a system of oscillators . in the particularly simple case of two coupled oscillators ,",
    "the equations describing the dynamics of the kuramoto model are @xmath132 \\\\",

    "the relevant dynamical variable is @xmath139 , which obeys the following evolution equation : @xmath140.\\ ] ] where @xmath141 .",
    "if we define an ( asymptotic ) angular velocity of the phase difference between the oscillators as @xmath142 , then @xmath143 may be estimated as @xmath144 divided by the time needed for @xmath145 to go from @xmath146 to @xmath147 ( this is independent of @xmath146 ) , namely @xmath148 where the final integral can be done with the method of residues , by changing variables to the complex number @xmath149 and noting that @xmath150 .",
    "as in our simplified model , we find that the relevant `` order parameter '' , @xmath143 , behaves as @xmath151 , with @xmath152 , close to the transition .    finally , the full lattice boltzmann simulations of our cholesteric dimers lead to a similar scaling for @xmath63 ( see fig .",

    "the critical force estimated through the fit is @xmath70 , which is in agreement with @xmath1530.025,0.0275[$ ] observed in simulations .",
    "this shows that our minimal theory captures the physics of the dynamical phase transition between the rotor and slip phases , and also suggests that this is in the same universality class of oscillator synchronisation and of the depinning of charge density waves in a perfectly periodic medium .",
    "note that , although the near - critical behaviour of our `` order parameter '' is given by @xmath154 , both our simulation data and the numerics corresponding to eqs .",

    "<S> we study by simulation the physics of two colloidal particles in a cholesteric liquid crystal with tangential order parameter alignment at the particle surface . </S>",
    "<S> the effective force between the pair is attractive at short range and favours assembly of colloid dimers at specific orientations relative to the local director field . when pulled through the fluid by a constant force along the helical axis , we find that such a dimer rotates , either continuously or stepwise with phase - slip events . </S>",
    "<S> these cases are separated by a sharp dynamical transition and lead respectively to a constant or an ever - increasing phase lag between the dimer orientation and the local nematic director .    </S>",
    "<S> self - assembly is one of the key aims of present - day nanotechnology . </S>",
    "<S> the idea underpinning this concept is that , through a careful control of the interactions in a suspension of particles , it is possible to drive the spontaneous formation of an ordered target structure or pattern , starting from a disordered initial condition . the process is spontaneous as it often entails the minimisation , whether global or local , of the free energy of the system . </S>",
    "<S> an outstanding specific challenge in modern self - assembly is to build a structure with a target _ dynamic _ feature , such as a synthetic microscopic rotor , walker or swimmer  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> colloidal dispersions in liquid crystals offer a useful system for the development of self - assembly strategies at the microscale . even in nematics , the simplest liquid crystalline phase , elastic distortions and topological defects mediate a variety of interactions resulting in the formation of wires , colloidal crystals , cellular solids , and clusters entangled by disclinations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this variety of self - assembled structures is possible because one can tune the liquid crystal mediated interactions by changing , e.g. , the strength and nature of the liquid crystal ordering at the colloidal surface . </S>",
    "<S> these alter the local symmetry of the director field near the particle and hence qualitatively change the effective interparticle forces .    here </S>",
    "<S> we show that a powerful way to extend the potential for self - assembly of colloids in liquid crystals is to consider cholesterics , or chiral nematics . in cholesterics </S>",
    "<S> the direction of the molecular order in the ground state spontaneously twists . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial modulation of the twist is in the micron range , therefore of the order of typical colloidal sizes . </S>",
    "<S> we have previously shown  @xcite that by varying the ratio between these two fundamental length scales , it is possible to change continuously the topology of the defects , or disclination lines , surrounding a single particle  </S>",
    "<S> morphological changes with no direct counterpart in nematics . </S>",
    "<S> very recently , mackay and denniston  @xcite took a step further and studied the interparticle elastic force felt in a cholesteric by two colloidal spheres with tangential anchoring of the director field at their surface . </S>",
    "<S> as in the nematic case  @xcite , there is a complex interplay between repulsive and attractive directions which leads to the formation of a dimer or longer chains . </S>",
    "<S> here we focus on the simplest case of a dimer , but progress beyond the purely static investigation of  @xcite to show that such a dimer exhibits unexpected and intriguing dynamical properties . </S>",
    "<S> when subjected to an external force ( for instance gravity ) along the cholesteric helix , the dimer rotates about this axis in a screw - like fashion . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the magnitude of the force , the dimer either rotates continuously or exhibits phase slippage , alternating periods of smooth rotation with static spells in which it translates without rotation . </S>",
    "<S> this dynamical transition shows similar near - critical behaviour to the depinning of driven vortices and of charged density waves in superconductors , both of which may be studied with the frenkel - kontorova model for transport in a periodic potential  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another analogue is provided by the synchronization of coupled oscillators described by the kuramoto model  @xcite . within our liquid crystal context </S>",

    "<S> , we find that in the rotor phase the angular velocity is @xmath58 ( this is true within statistical error using data in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 3 ) , and that the critical force is @xmath59 . above this threshold </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath32 increases with time as in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2f ( solid symbols ) . </S>",
    "<S> the asymptotic velocity @xmath60  @xcite for @xmath61 provides a useful `` order parameter '' to characterise the rotor - slippage transition . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the angular velocity @xmath42 decreases as @xmath62 for large @xmath34 .    </S>",
    "<S> importantly , eqs .  </S>",

    "<S> 3c for a @xmath65 fit ) . </S>",
    "<S> the near - critical behaviour of @xmath63 in our transition is similar to that of the velocity of a chain of driven particles in a periodic potential described by the frenkel - kontorova model  @xcite , suggesting that our dimer provides a liquid crystal representative of a wider class of models  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> another analogue is with the synchronisation of two driven oscillators described by the kuramoto model  @xcite , where synchronised and unsynchronised states correspond to the rotor and slippage regimes respectively . at the same time </S>",
    "<S> , we note that the physics of our cholesteric dimers is richer than that in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ simple - theory ] . </S>",
    "<S> whereas the symmetry of the problem suggests that there should always be a very low force regime in which the dimer behaves as a rotor , the existence of the phase slippage regime at higher forces depends on the form of the effective pair potential . </S>",
    "<S> the required conditions hold for tangential anchoring but , according to our preliminary studies is violated in the normal anchoring case , for which we have not observed a phase slip regime .    </S>",
    "<S> our study may be viewed as a generalisation of a classical problem : the sedimentation of two spheres in a viscous fluid . </S>",
    "<S> intriguingly , fig .  </S>",
    "<S> 3b shows that the velocity  force curves are not linear , even in the stokes limit of effectively zero reynolds number . </S>",
    "<S> rather , they appear to have different slopes ( i.e. effective viscosities ) in the rotor and phase slippage regimes . </S>",
    "<S> this is different to what occurs for a single sedimenting particle in a cholesteric , which leads to a linear velocity  force relation in the force range simulated here  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this biphasic force - velocity curve is due to the dynamic transition we discussed , and has no counterpart in classical sedimentation , in either newtonian or maxwell fluids . in the newtonian case , sinking side by side speeds up the particles , by up to a factor of 2  @xcite , which is not true in our rotor phase ( where we find that a dimer sediments _ slower _ than a single particle ) . in a maxwell fluid </S>",
    "<S> , the repulsive or attractive interaction between two spheres sedimenting side - by - side is controlled by normal stresses  @xcite . in our case </S>",

    "<S> the non - linear fit in ( a ) is @xmath66 , with @xmath67 a constant . </S>",
    "<S> ( c ) shows @xmath63 as a function of @xmath34 together with a fit to @xmath68 , with @xmath69 a constant and @xmath70 . ]    in conclusion , we have studied the equilibrium and dynamic properties of two colloidal spheres in a cholesteric liquid crystal . </S>",
    "<S> we have seen that chirality leads to a major change in the effective potential felt by the pair , with respect to the nematic limit . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic forces we find lead to the stabilisation of a dimer at an angle of either 0@xmath27 or 90@xmath27 degrees , as opposed to the 30@xmath27 found in nematics . </S>",
    "<S> these results , alongside those of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , suggest that it would be instructive to repeat the experiments performed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite with a cholesteric liquid crystal . based on our results </S>",
    "<S> , one may also speculate that variations in particle size ( or cholesteric pitch ) can affect the local free energy landscape of colloidal suspensions in liquid crystals , and potentially drive the self - assembly of different structures .    </S>",
    "<S> our main result is that , when subjected to an external force , the dimer rotates , either smoothly as a corkscrew or intermittently , with phase slippage . </S>",
    "<S> this transition occurs as the forcing exceeds a critical threshold : its value may be estimated via a simple theory considering the interplay between a spatially periodic angular potential and an external driving . </S>",
    "<S> the existence of the phase slippage regime is however highly non - trivial and relies on a delicate balance in the equilibrium and dynamic properties of our dimers : for example we have not observed it for dimers with normal anchoring . </S>",
    "<S> an interesting possibility for future research would be to study the effects of external electric field applied to our colloidal dimer , as done with platelets  @xcite and nematic colloids  @xcite , where unusual dynamics was triggered by the field .    </S>",
