    "both hfs and saturation lead to line broadening .",
    "this degeneracy complicates the use of stellar absorption lines as diagnostic of the hyperfine coupling constants .",

    "the 1.8  mev gamma - ray emission due to the decay of @xmath8al into @xmath8 mg has been the object of extensive space borne surveys : with a half - life of @xmath14  yr , @xmath8al is a signpost of recent nucleosynthesis .",

    "the _ integral _ @xcite mission holds the promise of improved angular resolution with which to identify the most important contributor to the diffuse emission .",
    "although the decay of @xmath8al is observed in the ism at large , the @xmath8al/@xmath6al isotopic abundance ratio ( hereafter @xmath15 ) has never been measured in any astrophysical source .",
    "the only available upper limit in any specific object is that of @xcite , who observed the vibronic bands of alo at 1.5  @xmath0 m in the nova - like variable v4332 sgr , and reported an upper limit of @xmath121/10 , lacking a statistical discussion .    as an application of our detection of hfs in [ alvi ]",
    "3.66@xmath0 m @xmath1p@xmath2p@xmath3 ( hereafter [ alvi ] ) , which is the first in an astrophysical near - ir emission line , we can set an upper limit on @xmath8al/@xmath6al using the difference in the hfs of both isotopes : the stable isotope @xmath6al has a nuclear spin @xmath5 , while @xmath8al has a nuclear spin @xmath9 .",
    "this new upper limit is the most stringent obtained so far in any astrophysical target .",
    "the first detection of atomic hfs in emission , aside from the 21  cm hi line , is to our knowledge the observation of resolved hfs in [ @xmath16cii ] 157.8@xmath0 m @xmath17p@xmath18p@xmath19 by @xcite .",
    "@xcite identified multiple components in [ naiv ]  9.0@xmath0 m with the hyperfine splitting of @xmath20p@xmath21p@xmath3 .",
    "although [ naiv ]  9.04@xmath0 m and [ alvi ]  3.66@xmath0 m are the same fine - structure transitions from isoelectronic ions , they differ in nuclear spin and electronic wave - functions , leading to different hyperfine structures .",
    "we also derive values for the electric quadrupole constants ( hereafter @xmath22 constants ) in the [ alvi ] transition . to our knowledge , this is the first measurement of such constants in an atomic transition in any astrophysical object , although the @xmath22 quadrupole constants have been measured in molecular transitions .",
    "in contrast with atomic hfs , in molecules the hyperfine splitting of a given rotational transition primarily derives from nuclear quadrupole moments rather than from nuclear magnetic moments ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for instance @xmath22 values have previously been measured by @xcite in cn(k = 1 -0 ) at 2.6  mm , and by @xcite in hcnh@xmath23(j = 1 - 0 ) at 74  ghz . in this work",
    "we show that the inclusion of the atomic electric quadrupole terms has important spectroscopic consequences .",
    "it allows improved measurement of the magnetic dipole coupling constants by lifting the statistical bias between the magnetic dipole constants of the upper and lower levels .    in this work",
    "we demonstrate the use of hfs itself as a diagnostic tool in the context of planetary nebulae ( pne ) .",
    "atomic hyperfine effects have previously been used by @xcite in ciii ]  @xmath241909.6 @xmath25s@xmath26p@xmath27 to measure @xmath16c/@xmath28c in pne .",
    "they recognised that the non - zero nuclear spin of @xmath16c additionallyp and @xmath25p states due to magnetic interactions between the electrons ] mixes the @xmath1p@xmath27 and @xmath1p@xmath3 fine - structure states .",
    "]  @xmath241909.6 is dipolar - electric in @xmath16c , while it is completely forbidden in @xmath28c because it has no net nuclear spin .",

    "ngc  6302 is the highest excitation pn known , with a spectrum rich in molecular lines , dust , and coronal ions such as [ siix ]  3.93  @xmath0 m , which can only be produced by photons harder than 303  ev , or by electron collisions at @xmath29k .",
    "its spectrum can be reproduced by ionisation - bounded photoionisation models with a @xmath30k central star @xcite , and the absence of a fast wind makes improbable a significant contribution from shock excitation . although the report of @xcite for broad wings under [ nev ]  3426  has been taken as evidence for a fast wind in ngc  6302 , a 300010000     echellogramme we acquired with uves on the vlt ( casassus et al .",
    ", in preparation ) does not confirm the observations of @xcite .",
    "the photoionised coronal lines in ngc  6302 are astonishingly narrow @xcite compared to conditions of collisional ionisation where their abundance is maximum .",
    "the line - widths measured by @xcite reflect negligible thermal broadening from photo - ionised gas temperatures of 20000  k , and very small expansion velocities in a filled - in nebula .",
    "it is its small expansion velocity and rich spectrum that makes ngc  6302 an ideal object for the use of hyperfine structure as a diagnostic tool .",
    "we describe data acquisition in section  [ sec : obs ] , then data analysis and results in section  [ sec : hfsfits ] , and summarise our conclusions in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "data reduction and analysis were carried - out using the perl data language ( http://pdl.perl.org ) .",
    "we observed ngc  6302 with phoenix @xcite on gemini south on 5 nights of may and july 2003 , as summarised in table  [ table : log ] . the slit position angle was 70  deg east of north , and it was centred on ngc  6302 s radio core at j2000 ra=17:13:44.4 , dec=-37:06:11.2 , as inferred from the 5  ghz map of @xcite , at the position of the intensity decrease in the centre of the putative radio torus .",
    "[ fig : slit ] shows the slit position overlaid on the r - band image obtained with gemini s acquisition camera .",
    "background cancellation was obtained by differentiation with a reference field devoid of nebular emission , offset 40@xmath31 north of the nebular core .",
    "typical integration times in the settings were 1h-2h on - source for each night , but the noise level largely reflects the weather conditions .",
    "poor weather also results in inaccurate background cancellation .",
    "the seeing has a direct impact on the resolution of the spectra , by convolving the emission in the slit with neighbouring emission from the expanding nebula .",
    "the emission that falls through the slit is the convolution of the slit aperture with the point spread function . because of the spatial variations of radial velocity within the nebula",
    ", poor seeing allows emission from material with a wider range of velocities to be admitted by the spectrograph slit .",
    "the resulting spectra are therefore degraded by a combination of the instrumental resolution and the spatial variations in velocity .",
    "the acquisition of a precise position in the nebula is important to obtain consistent spectra . to centre the slit on the position of ngc",
    "6302 s radio core we peaked - up on a reference astrometric standard in the k band , then offset to the object , switched detector settings and applied an additional offset to account for the difference in refraction between the filters . peaking - up with a narrow slit is difficult because of variations in the seeing on time - scales comparable to the acquisition procedure .",
    "the accuracy involved in peaking - up depends on the seeing and the slit - width .",
    "the overall positional uncertainty is @xmath120.6  arcsec , as estimated by adding in quadrature the errors involved in peaking up , of about 0.35@xmath31 ( or twice the slit - width ) , in offsetting from the reference star , of @xmath120.5  @xmath31 , and in the filter change , of @xmath120.1@xmath31 ( bernadette rodgers , private communication ) .",
    "the resulting spectra for the three best nights are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : frames ] , after subtraction of a small level of continuum nebular emission .",
    "wavelengths are given in air and in the observatory rest frame .",
    "there are at least four emission features observed near the [ alvi ] wavelength given by @xcite of 3.659  @xmath0 m .",
    "the three brightest features share simular position - velocity structures .",
    "because the 1  arcsec uncertainty in acquisition is larger than the slit width , spectra taken on different nights may not sample the same region in the nebula , so we only coadded the frames taken with the same instrumental setting ( i.e. within the same night ) .",
    "another reason to avoid averaging all the spectra is to keep a good spectral resolution : it can be inferred by inspection of fig .  [",
    "fig : frames ] that the night of july 30@xmath32 has the best line contrast , even though we used the widest slit .",
    "the sharpest lines should be obtained with the narrowest slit .",
    "the quality of the spectrum from july 30@xmath32 reflects that it was acquired under the best weather conditions .",
    "no reference lines were visible in the calibration exposures taken with a th - ar - ne arc lamp in the [ alvi ] instrument configuration .",
    "instead we used emission lines from coadded sky spectra extracted from the science observations ( without differencing the nodded frames ) .",
    "we fit a straight line to the position of sky emission features present in a model high - resolution sky spectrum based on the hitran database @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the inferred dispersion law is checked _ a - posteriori _ by comparing different nights and previous wavelength measurements .",
    "the raw spectra are modulated by the atmospheric transmission ( hereafter at ) spectrum , which is reasonably smooth near [ alvi ] ( at does not show deep troughs ) .",
    "we correct for the at modulation by dividing the object frames by the spectrum of a standard star ( hr  6789 ) grown along the slit .",
    "the optimal aperture for spectrum extraction in the spatial direction along the slit was determined by varying the upper @xmath33 and lower @xmath34 rows of detector pixels .",
    "we summed all the signal in the detector within the rows @xmath34 and @xmath33 , and estimate the noise level _ a - posteriori _ , from the rms dispersion of the output spectrum in a region devoid of line emission .",
    "a search in the 2-d parameter space @xmath35 , @xmath36 for the best signal - to - noise spectrum gives the optimal aperture indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : frames ] .",
    "we hereafter refer to spectra extracted with this optimal aperture as collapsed spectra .",

    "+ @xmath37 and @xmath1 same as table  [ table : fits ] + @xmath38best fit isotopic ratio , using fixed hfs constants + @xmath39rest wavelength in @xmath0 m and in air .",
    "we have identified the multiple components near [ alvi ] as due to the hfs splitting of @xmath6al .",
    "theory agrees with the observed magnetic dipole hfs coupling constants within the uncertainties , giving support for the use of theoretical constants in the modelling of ionic lines profiles .",
    "we provide the first measurements of electric quadrupole hyperfine coupling constants for any atomic transition in any astrophysical object .",
    "we discuss the spectroscopic importance of the quadrupole terms .",
    "the inclusion of the quadrupole terms improves the measurement of the magnetic dipole constants , which are otherwised affected by a statistical bias .    as an application we have set a 3@xmath10 upper limit on the aluminum isotopic ratio , @xmath8al/@xmath6al @xmath40",
    "this is the most stringent upper limit on the relative @xmath8al abundance in any astrophysical object to date .",
    "however , the accuracy of our measurement is short of quantifying @xmath8al production in agb stars .",
    "the expected isotopic ratio at the tip of the agb is at most 1/37 , from the ratio of the @xmath8al and @xmath6al yields in the 6  m@xmath41 models of @xcite .",
    "the progenitor mass of ngc  6302 is about 56  m@xmath41 from the data summarised in @xcite .",
    "but the predicted @xmath8al/@xmath6al ratio lies below our @xmath42 upper limit .",
    "we can only discard @xmath43 at 2.5  @xmath10 .",
    "doubling our integration on [ alvi ] in ngc  6302 would allow a firm test on the theoretical predictions .",
    "to establish useful constraints on the @xmath8al production by agb stars we must deepen our observations of ngc6302 , and extend the analysis to other targets . only pne and symbiotic stars have moderate expansion velocities and photoionised coronal - line regions , offering narrow emission line profiles in high - excitation species , which are otherwise thermally broadened in the sun",
