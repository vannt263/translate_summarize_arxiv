    "integral - equation methods are a very powerful tool to determine the thermodynamics and the liquid structure of simple fluids @xcite .",
    "they rely on different approximate closure relations which , supplemented by the ornstein - zernike ( oz ) equation , allow a direct and numerically fast determination of the pair correlation functions as well as of thermodynamic quantities like pressure , compressibility , chemical potential , @xmath0 for simple fluids these methods can not compete nowadays with monte carlo and molecular - dynamics simulations .",
    "nonetheless , they have the advantage of providing reasonably accurate estimates of thermodynamic quantities with a very limited effort , and they are therefore a very valuable tool when the system under investigation depends on many parameters , for instance in the case of multicomponent systems .",
    "moreover , they are still very useful for the analysis of systems for which atomistic simulations are particularly slow , for instance in glassy systems ; see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite .",
    "liquid - state integral equations have also been extensively used to compute fluid - fluid phase - coexistence lines . in the density region",
    "in which the system demixes , integral equations may not converge , or may converge to physically unacceptable solutions .",
    "the relation between the boundary of this nonconvergence region ( we will call it termination line ) and the binodal and the spinodal curves characterizing the two - phase unstable region has been the subject of many studies , see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite . in particular , it has been shown that , except in the case of very simple approximations , thermodynamical quantities do not show any particular divergence on this line , hence it can not be taken as an approximate estimate of the spinodal line .",
    "however , it is usually assumed that it is somewhat close to the line where phase separation occurs .    in this paper",
    "we wish to investigate the reliability of integral - equation methods for the determination of the phase diagrams of typical coarse - grained models of soft - matter systems .",
    "we consider here a binary mixture of soft and hard spheres of different sizes with an intrinsic nonadditive nature .",
    "although we take specific pair potentials , appropriate to describe , in a coarse - grained fashion , a binary system of hard - sphere colloids and long polymers under good - solvent conditions @xcite , the conclusions should apply to a general class of soft - matter systems that can be modelled as mixtures of soft and/or hard spheres , interacting via short - range potentials @xcite .",
    "the phase diagram of the coarse - grained model has been accurately determined in ref .",
    "@xcite , by means of monte carlo simulations , for different values of the polymer - to - colloid size ratio . here",
    ", we investigate the same problem by using integral - equation methods .",
    "we employ the hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) , the percus - yevick ( py ) , the rogers - young ( ry ) , and the reference hnc ( rhnc ) closures @xcite . for each of them",
    "we determine the termination line , whose position is then compared with the monte carlo binodal with the purpose of understanding if this line provides a reasonable approximation of the boundary of the two - phase region . for small polymer densities , we will also be able to compute by monte carlo simulations the bridge functions  quantities that have an intrinsic interest in liquid - state theories  which can then be compared with the approximate ones considered in the different approaches .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we define the model , report the definitions of the different closures we use , and the explicit expressions of the quantities that are considered in the paper . in sec .  [ sec3 ]",
    "we present our results . in sec .",
    "[ sec3.1 ] we determine the termination line for the different closures for two different values of the polymer - to - colloid size ratio @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in sec .",
    "[ sec3.2 ] we compare the integral - equation predictions for structure and thermodynamics with monte carlo results . in sec .",
    "[ sec3.3 ] we determine the bridge functions with monte carlo methods and compare them with those used in the different integral - equation approaches . in sec .  [ sec3.4 ] we consider a novel approximation that uses the monte - carlo determined bridge functions . finally , in sec .  [ sec4 ] we draw our conclusions .",
    "technical details are reported in appendix [ appa ] .",
    "the explicit expressions of the potentials are reported in appendix [ appb ] .",
    "in this section we report the explicit expressions of the pair potentials .",
    "the model consists of coarse - grained polymers , represented as soft particles , and colloids .",
    "polymers interact via a pair potential @xmath4 given by @xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 .",
    "colloids interact as hard spheres : @xmath13 the polymer - colloid pair potential depends on @xmath1 . for small values of @xmath6 , i.e. for @xmath14 ( @xmath15 ) , the potential @xmath16 is large , hence it is impossible ( and practically irrelevant ) to estimate it accurately .",
    "for @xmath17 we parametrize it as @xmath18 ^ 2}+a_2(q ) e^{-[|b - c_2(q)|/e_2(q)]^{d_2(q)}},\\ ] ] where @xmath6 .",
    "estimates of the coefficients are reported in table  [ tab : coeff - vcp ] . to verify the accuracy of the parametrization",
    ", we compare the estimate of @xmath19 ( @xmath20 is the second polymer - colloid virial coefficient ) obtained by using the parametrized potential and the estimate of the same quantity in the full - monomer model @xcite . using the parametrized potentials we obtain @xmath21 for @xmath22 , 0.8 , and 1 , respectively , to be compared with the full - monomer results @xmath23 , 41.7(1 ) , 27.54(6 ) .",
    "differences are small ( they are less than 0.6% ) , confirming the accuracy of the results .",

    "<S> using computer - simulation results as a benchmark , we find that the hypernetted - chain approximation provides accurate estimates of thermodynamics and structure in the colloid - gas phase in which the density of colloids is small . on the other hand , all closures considered appear to be unable to describe the behavior of the mixture in the colloid - liquid phase , as they cease to converge at polymer densities significantly smaller than those at the binodal . as a consequence , </S>",
