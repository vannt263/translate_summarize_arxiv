    "interferometers are playing a key role in the determination of fundamental cosmological parameters through observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "three such instruments have been constructed and deployed over the last few years  the cosmic background imager ( cbi ) , operating at 5080 m altitude in the chilean andes ( padin et  al .",
    "2001 , 2002 ) ; the degree angular scale interferometer ( dasi ) , operating at 2800 m altitude at the south pole ( leitch et  al .",
    "2002a ) ; and the very small array ( vsa ) operating at an altitude of 2400 m in tenerife ( watson et  al .",
    "2003 ) , for which a prototype was the cambridge anisotropy telescope ( cat ) ( scott et  al .",
    "1996 ) . in this paper",
    "we review the characteristics of interferometers that render them particularly well suited to cmb observations , and we then discuss the cosmological results from observations with these three instruments .        it is well known that bolometers have also played a crucial role in the development of this field , and the interested reader will find an account of the bolometer cmb results in the companion review in this volume by lange .",
    "while we do not discuss the bolometer results here , they are in excellent agreement with the interferometer results described below ( de  bernardis et  al .",
    "2000 ; hanany et  al .",
    "2000 ; lee et  al .  2001",
    "; netterfield et  al .",
    "2002 ) , and all of these results are in excellent agreement with the recently released _",
    "wmap _ results ( bennett et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the cbi , shown in figure [ fig : cbi ] , was the first of the new generation of cmb interferometers to be brought into operation ( padin et  al .",
    "2001 ) , in january 2000 . at that time",
    "the cbi began routine total intensity observations as well as preliminary polarization observations using a single cross - polarized antenna .",
    "we describe the cbi here in some detail since both the dasi and the vsa share most of these characteristics , and we point out the principal features in the vsa and the dasi in which they differ from the cbi .",
    "all three instruments operate in the ka waveguide band ( 26  40 ghz ) and use low - noise amplifiers ( lnas ) based on high electron mobility transistors ( hemts ) , which were designed by marian pospieszalski of the national radio astronomy observatory ( pospieszalski et  al .  1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the specifications of the three instruments are given in table [ tab : specs ] .",
    "as described by padin et  al .",
    "( 2002 ) , the cbi has 13 90-cm diameter antennas mounted on a 6-m platform .",
    "in addition to the usual altazimuth rotation axes , the cbi platform can be rotated about the optical axis .",
    "this third axis of rotation enables the array to maintain a constant parallactic angle while tracking a celestial source ; it also greatly facilitates polarization observations and calibration , and , in addition , it provides a powerful method of discriminating between sky signals and instrumental cross - talk . for each baseline both the real and imaginary channels",
    "are correlated in a complex correlator , and there are 10 1-ghz bandwidth frequency channels spanning the range 2636 ghz .",
    "thus , the cbi comprises a total of 780 complex interferometers .",
    "the fundamental data rate is 0.84  s. for typical total intensity observations the data are averaged over 10 samples , so that on each interferometer the complex visibility is measured every 8.4 s.            the aperture - plane , or ( _ u , v _ ) , coverage of the cbi is shown in figure [ fig : cbiuv ] . in this figure",
    "the ( _ u , v _ ) coverage corresponding to a single baseline should be the convolution of two apertures centered on the ( _ u , v _ ) point corresponding to the baseline length and orientation . for clarity we have shrunk the aperture convolution to a single point to make the distribution of the coverage clearer",
    ". there is , of course , much overlap in the coverage when the full diameters are used , since the antenna diameter of 90 cm is close to the size of the shortest baselines ( 100 cm ) .",
    "mosaic observations of contiguous fields improve the resolution in multipole space .",
    "for example , in the cbi , mosaic observations have been used to improve the multipole resolution from @xmath3 to @xmath4 .",
    "cbi mosaic observations of three fields are shown in figure [ fig : mosaics ] .",
    "the dasi is shown in figure [ fig : dasi ] .",
    "the dasi was designed to complement the cbi in multipole coverage , and many of the detailed cbi designs , including those for the correlator , the receiver control cards , and the channelizer , as well as the telescope control and data acquisition software , were shared with the dasi team , who duplicated these components in the dasi . for these reasons ,",
    "the dasi is in many respects a copy of the cbi , but @xmath5 4 times smaller .",
    "the dasi achromatic polarizers were duplicated by the dasi team for use on the cbi in its upgraded phase for full polarization observations , which commenced in october 2002 .",
    "the dasi observed in total intensity mode during the austral winter of 2000 , and was then outfitted with achromatic polarizers and both a ground screen and a sunscreen , shown in figure [ fig : dasi ] , for the austral winter of 2001 when it made polarization observations of two fields , as described by zaldarriaga ( 2003 ) .",
    "the vsa ( figure [ fig : vsa ] ) and the dasi are similar in size , and originally covered similar multipole ranges ( and hence very similar angular scales ) , extending from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with a resolution in multipoles of @xmath8 . in 2001",
    "the original vsa horns were replaced with a larger set that extended the vsa range up to @xmath9 .",
    "the cbi covers the range @xmath10 to @xmath11 with a multipole resolution in mosaicing mode of @xmath12 .",
    "apart from this primary difference in multipole range and resolution , the other major difference is in the correlators  the cbi and the dasi each have 10 1-ghz channels , operating between 26 ghz and 36 ghz , while the vsa has a single tunable 1.5-ghz channel , which operates over the same frequency range .          which may be expanded into spherical harmonics @xmath18 where @xmath19 are the multipole moments @xmath20 if the cmb is isotropic it must be rotationally invariant so that the fluctuations can be expressed in terms of a one - dimensional angular spectrum , @xmath21 , and the variance of @xmath22 can be expressed in terms of this angular power spectrum : @xmath23 for large @xmath24 , @xmath25 showing that the contribution to the variance from a logarithmic interval of @xmath24 is proportional to @xmath26 .",
    "it is therefore often convenient to plot this quantity versus log@xmath27 , so this convention is adopted by many authors in displaying angular spectra of the cmb .",
    "it should be borne in mind , however , that the signal is @xmath28 , so that , in plotting @xmath26 we are artificially boosting the apparent variance at high @xmath24 by a factor @xmath29 . _ observations at high @xmath24 therefore require far greater sensitivity than is immediately apparent from this conventional way of plotting the angular power spectrum .",
    "_    the angular correlation function is defined as @xmath30 where by isotropy and homogeneity @xmath31 is a function only of @xmath32 , and @xmath33 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the legendre polynomial .",
    "the inverse result is @xmath36 these two results are the analogs on the sphere of the theorem relating the covariance function to the fourier transform of the power spectrum .    in interferometric observations of the cmb",
    "the fields of view , even for mosaic observations , are small enough that the small - angle approximation may be used .",
    "that is , we can assume that @xmath37 in this case @xmath38 so that @xmath39    if we set @xmath40 then this is a hankel transform , which is simply the two - dimensional fourier transform for a circularly symmetric function ; i.e. , as expected , the angular correlation function and the power spectrum form a fourier transform pair in the small - angle approximation .    in practice",
    "we observe the sky with instruments of finite size , so that what we observe is the convolution of the sky brightness distribution with the instrument response function , corresponding to a product in the fourier transform ( spectral ) domain : @xmath41 where @xmath42 is called the window function of the instrument .",
    "we do not review here the basic theory of radio interferometry , but refer the reader to the comprehensive text of thompson , moran , & swenson ( 2001 ) .",
    "useful discussions of the application of standard radio interferometric techniques to observations of the cmb have been given by hobson , lasenby , & jones ( 1995 ) , white et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , hobson & maisinger ( 2002 ) , and myers et  al .",
    "( 2003 ) .            *",
    "automatic subtraction of the mean signal ( to high precision ) * precise knowledge of the beamshape is easy to obtain ( and is not as important as it is in single - dish observations ) * direct measurements of visibilities ( which are very nearly the desired fourier components of the sky brightness distribution ) * precision radiometry ( through observations of planets , supernova remnants , quasars , and radio galaxies ) * precision polarimetry ( and , in the case of the cbi , making use of the third axis of rotation about the optical axis ) * repeated baselines enable a wide variety of instrumental crosschecks    we discuss each of these interferometer properties separately below , illustrating some of them with examples from the cbi .",
    "it should be clear that similar advantages apply , in most cases , to the dasi and the vsa .      a multiplying interferometer ( fig .",
    "[ fig : interferometer ] ) has the advantage over adding interferometers and other total - power detection systems in that the mean signal is subtracted automatically to high precision ( ryle 1952 ) . in the adding interferometer the voltages from the two antennas are added and then squared in a square - law detector , so that the power output from the square - law detector is proportional to @xmath43 .",
    "ryle introduced the phase - switched interferometer in which the voltages are alternately summed and differenced by introducing a @xmath44 phase offset in one of the signals , and then detected by a phase - synchronous detector , which is in phase with the phase switch . in this system",
    "the output power is the time average of @xmath45 , and so it is proportional the the product of the voltages from the two antennas .",
    "the power output in this system is thus independent of the mean level of the signal , @xmath46 , and it measures the correlation between the two signals , @xmath47 .",
    "modern interferometers , such as those discussed here , accomplish the same effect by using a correlator . since , in a multiplying or phase - switching interferometer , the mean signal does not appear , and only the spatially varying signal appears , this eliminates many sources of spurious systematic errors .",
    "this approach is particularly advantageous in cmb observations , in which the spatial fluctuations in temperature are over @xmath48 times smaller than the mean signal of 2.725 k ( mather et  al .",
    "for this reason a number of potential sources of systematic error are reduced to negligible levels by interferometry .",
    "the resolution of an interferometer is set by the baseline length between the antenna pair , rather than by the primary beam of the individual antennas .",
    "thus , in interferometric observations precise knowledge of the primary beamshape is not required in order to measure the power spectrum on small angular scales .",
    "of course , precise knowledge of the primary beamshape is needed in computing the covariance function of the instrument , but this can be determined to the required accuracy of a few percent by measurements of the beamshape on bright unresolved radio sources .",
    "the profile of the mean primary beamshape for the cbi is shown in figure [ fig : beam ] .",
    "an interferometer measures visibility , which is the fourier transform of the product of the primary antenna beam , @xmath49 , with the sky brightness , @xmath50 .",
    "the visibilities , @xmath51 , measured by an interferometer are related to the sky brightness by @xmath52        the visibility is thus the convolution of the fourier transform of the sky brightness , @xmath53 ( i.e. , the angular spectrum of the sky brightness distribution ) , and of the primary beam , @xmath54 , @xmath55    an interferometer therefore measures directly the angular spectrum of the sky brightness distribution , which is the desired result , convolved with the fourier transform of the primary beam .",
    "an example of a single fourier component on the sky and of this component multiplied by the primary beam is shown in figure [ fig : interferometry ] .",
    "the matrix of the covariance between all the visibility measurements is the observed _ covariance matrix _ , @xmath56 , and this is made up of two parts , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the sky covariance matrix and @xmath59 is the noise covariance matrix .",
    "hobson et  al .",
    "( 1995 ) have shown that the sky covariance matrix is @xmath60 where @xmath61 is a generalized power spectrum of the intensity fluctuations . hence , converting to temperature fluctuations , we find that for cmb fluctuations , @xmath62 where @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66 , and @xmath67 is the _ window function_.      a great advantage of interferometric measurements is precision radiometry . provided that there are sufficiently bright unresolved and nonvarying radio sources , the calibration of interferometers is straightforward . in the case of the cbi , for example , the primary calibrators were jupiter and tau a , and secondary calibrators were mars , saturn , and 3c  274 .",
    "of these only tau a is significantly resolved on the cbi , but it is easily modeled with an elliptical gaussian brightness profile .",
    "the internal calibration consistency on the cbi is considerably better than 1% , and the flux density scale , originally set by our own absolute calibrations at the owens valley radio observatory with an uncertainty of 3.3% ( mason et  al .",
    "1999 ) , has now been improved by comparison with the _ wmap _ temperature measurement of jupiter ( page et  al .",
    "2003 ) to an uncertainty of 1.3% ( readhead et  al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the instrumental polarization of radio interferometers is much easier to calibrate than single - dish instruments , because there is an elegant way of distinguishing between the polarization of the instrument and that of the source ( conway & kronberg 1969 ) . the instrumental polarization can be expressed in terms of _ leakage factors_. in the cbi each antenna observes either left- or right - circular polarization .",
    "the voltage output from a left - circularly polarized antenna , @xmath68 , may be written @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the electric field that we wish to measure , and @xmath71 represents the instrumental leakage of the unwanted right - circular polarization electric field , @xmath72 , on antenna @xmath68 .",
    "similarly , the voltage output of a right - circular polarized antenna , @xmath73 , may be written @xmath74 where @xmath75 represents the instrumental leakage of left - circular polarization on antenna @xmath73 .",
    "for a point source with zero circular polarization the correlator output on the lr cross - polarized baselinem which combines antenna @xmath68 with antenna @xmath73 , can be written @xmath76 where @xmath77 is the linear polarization , @xmath78 is the total intensity , @xmath79 is the polarization angle on the sky , and we have neglected terms of order @xmath80 and higher . the angle @xmath81 is the azimuthal angle of the antennas about the line of sight to the source . in the cbi and the dasi ,",
    "the antennas are mounted on a rotatable deck , so that , in addition to the usual two ( alt - az ) axes , the instruments can be rotated about the optical axis , thereby varying @xmath81 for all antennas simultaneously .",
    "the expression given above applies for instruments such as the cbi and the dasi in which a single rotation by @xmath81 of the deck upon which the antennas are all mounted leads to a phase advance of @xmath81 in one polarization and a phase retardation of @xmath81 in the other polarization  thereby giving rise to a relative phase shift of @xmath82 on cross - polarized baselines .    by means of rotation of the deck , it is easy to measure the instrumental polarization on an instrument such as the cbi or the dasi : we simply need to observe a bright unresolved polarized source , for which @xmath77 and @xmath79 are known , such as 3c  279 , and measure @xmath83 while varying @xmath81 by rotating the deck .",
    "the complex number @xmath83 then traces out an ellipse that is closely approximated by a circle of radius @xmath84 centered on the point @xmath85    by observing a bright source of known polarization on all baselines , it is then possible to solve for the individual antenna leakage factors to high precision .",
    "both the cbi and the dasi use achromatic polarizers with leakage factors @xmath86 designed by john kovac ( kovac et  al .  2002 ) , so that , after correcting for instrumental polarization , uncertainties in polarization due to instrumental effects are @xmath87 .",
    "the polarization of the cmb can be expressed in terms of a curl - free mode and a curl mode . by analogy with electromagnetic theory",
    "these are designated as the @xmath88-mode and the @xmath89-mode .",
    "the strongest polarized signal in the cmb is due to thomson scattering by electrons of the anisotropic radiation field due to quadrupole velocity anisotropy , and this is an @xmath88-mode component .",
    "the much weaker @xmath89-mode components would be caused by gravitational radiation or gravitational lensing ( see , e.g. , hu 2003 ) .    it can be shown that for the case of infinitely small antennas the sum of the lr+rl visibilities yields the fourier transform of the @xmath88-mode , while the difference lr@xmath90rl yields the fourier transform of the @xmath89-mode ( zaldarriaga 2001 ) .",
    "for the realistic case of finite antennas there is also a small amount of mixing of these modes due to the finite aperture .",
    "this is a direct analog of the arguments given above showing that the visibility in total intensity is the convolution of the angular spectrum with the fourier transform of the primary beam .      on the cbi",
    "there are many duplicated baselines in any given orientation of the deck , and further baseline duplication can be accomplished by deck rotation .",
    "this is very useful in tracking down and eliminating various sources of systematic errors ( e.g. , cross - talk between electronic components ) .",
    "it also provides for crosschecks of visibilities on calibrators measured on different baselines , etc .",
    "the cbi began cmb observations at the chilean site in january 2000 , and the dasi and the vsa began their observations shortly thereafter . in this section",
    "we discuss the details of the spectra revealed by these interferometric observations , and in the following section we discuss the constraints that these place on key cosmological parameters .",
    "the first results from the new generation of interferometers were published by the cbi group in january 2001 .",
    "these were the first observations of the cmb with both the sensitivity and the resolution to make images of the mass fluctuations on scales corresponding to clusters of galaxies ( padin et  al .",
    "2001 ; mason et  al .  2003",
    "; pearson et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and the images show clearly , and for the first time , the seeds that gave rise to galaxy clusters ( fig . [",
    "fig : mosaics ] ) .",
    "the straight line in figure [ fig : masses ] shows the mass within a spherical region at the epoch of last scattering as a function of the angular diameter of the sphere , assuming a @xmath91cdm cosmology . also shown are the angular scales and the corresponding mass scales that have been probed by key cmb experiments over the last three years .",
    "in addition , these were the first cmb observations to show the reduction in spectral power at high multipole numbers due to the damping tail at small scales caused by photon viscosity and the finite thickness of the last - scattering region .",
    "thus , this major pillar of the standard @xmath91cdm cosmology has been confirmed by the cbi observations .",
    "the cbi spectrum for observations from january 2000 through november 2001 is shown in figure [ fig : cbispectrum ] .      at the frequency of operation of the cbi ( 26  36 ghz ) , and at multipoles above @xmath93",
    ", there is significant foreground contamination due to radio galaxies and quasars .",
    "these are dealt with in the cbi data by a constraint matrix approach , such as was first used on interferometry data by the dasi ( leitch et  al .",
    "2002a ) , and which effectively `` projects out '' the point sources .",
    "the application to the cbi is described in detail by mason et  al .",
    "thus far it has been necessary to use the 1.4  ghz nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) ( condon et  al .",
    "1998 ) for identifying possible contaminating sources , because there is no higher - frequency radio survey that covers the cbi fields .",
    "only @xmath94 of the nvss sources are flat - spectrum objects that are bright enough at the cbi frequencies to cause detectable contamination , and a survey of nvss sources in the cbi fields at @xmath95 ghz would enable us to identify these sources , thus reducing by a factor of 5 the number of sources that must be projected out of the cbi data . this would significantly increase the amount of cbi data that is retained , and it would substantially reduce the uncertainties in the cbi spectrum at multipoles higher than @xmath96 . it is possible to measure the flux densities of the nvss sources in the cbi frequency range with either the bonn 100-m telescope or with the green bank telescope .            in 2002",
    "the cbi was upgraded with the dasi - style achromatic polarizers , and the antennas were moved into a close - packed configuration that concentrates the observations into the multipole range @xmath97 . since october 2002 it has been observing in this configuration .",
    "the first dasi results were released in april 2001 ( halverson et  al .",
    "the dasi spectrum is shown in figure [ fig : dasispectrum ] .",
    "we see here a clear detection of the first and second acoustic peaks , and a hint of the third peak .",
    "these dasi results were the first interferometry results to show the first acoustic peak , which had first been seen clearly in the toco observations and then with very high signal - to - noise ratio in the boomerang results released in april 2000 ( de  bernardis et  al .",
    "2000 ) .    in the second year of operation ( 2001 )",
    "the dasi was outfitted with achromatic polarizers and carried out polarization observations that yielded a detection of polarized emission attributed to the cmb ( kovac et  al .",
    "2002 ; leitch et  al .",
    "thus , another key pillar of the standard cosmological model has been confirmed by an interferometer .",
    "the dasi polarization results are discussed in the article by zaldarriaga ( 2003 ) in this volume .",
    "the vsa was deployed in 2000 with a compact array ( scott et  al .",
    "2003 ; watson et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and the following year the horns were replaced with larger ones and the array was extended to longer baselines , thereby permitting the vsa to make observations of the cmb spectrum up to multipoles @xmath98 . the vsa cmb spectrum from the combination of observations with the original and extended arrays",

    "in order to avoid confusion , we have plotted only a single binning of the data from each instrument , but the reader should be aware that there is considerably more information than can be displayed in this one - dimensional plot . there is excellent agreement between these three independent experiments in the regions of overlap . some of the key cosmological results from these three interferometers are given in table [ tab : weakprior ] .",
    "the `` weak prior '' assumptions used here are that the age of the universe is greater than 10 billion years , @xmath144 , and @xmath145 .",
    "it can be seen that all three interferometers provide strong evidence for a flat geometry ( @xmath146 ) and a scale - invariant spectrum ( @xmath147 ) , both of which are expected for inflationary universes . given the strong evidence here for a flat geometry , we have also determined key parameters for the case of a flat universe , with the results shown in table [ tab : weakpriorplusflat ] , where it can again be seen that the results are in excellent agreement , and it is clear that the matter density is only about one - third of the critical density , with the predominant matter component being nonbaryonic .",
    "thus , the remainder of the energy density must be made up of something other than matter , and is here attributed to the cosmological constant .",
    "it is interesting to compare the cbi results , which depend almost entirely on high multipoles ( @xmath148 ) , and are therefore independent of the first peak , with the dasi and vsa results , which depend entirely on low multipoles , especially on the first peak .",
    "we see that the cosmological parameter values derived from both the dasi and the vsa agree very well with those derived from the cbi .",
    "this provides strong justification for the assumption of a featureless , primordial density fluctuation spectrum .",
    "this is important because it is conceivable that the structures observed in these angular spectra are not simply acoustic peaks , but contain significant features that are either present in the primordial spectrum or are produced by other , as yet undetermined , physical effects .",
    "if this were the case there could be significant errors in the derived cosmological parameters .",
    "however , it is almost inconceivable that we would derive the _",
    "same _ incorrect cosmological parameters from two different parts of the angular spectrum .",

    "the resulting significance relative to the @xmath91cdm model has therefore dropped to 2.3 @xmath165 .",
    "the tantalizing detection of the excess persists , therefore , albeit at lower significance , in the combined 2000 + 2001 cbi data set ( see readhead et  al .",
    "2003 ) , and more observations are required to confirm or disprove this excess .    if real , the excess at high multipoles detected by the cbi could have significant consequences , as has been spelled out in a number of papers ( e.g. , bond et  al .",
    "2003 ; oh , cooray , & kamionkowski 2003 ) .",
    "both of these papers ascribe the excess to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect .",
    "the paper by bond et  al .",
    "attributes the excess to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies , while that of oh et  al .",
    "attributes it to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in hot gas resulting from supernova explosions in the first generation of stars ( population iii ) .",
    "the _ wmap _ results ( bennett et  al .",
    "2003 ) have shown that reionization started early , at around a redshift of 20 , so it may be that both the cbi and _ wmap _ results provide evidence for population iii stars .",
    "the results from the three cmb interferometers show excellent agreement and provide compelling evidence for an approximately flat universe with an approximately scale - invariant spectrum .",
    "the derived baryonic matter density is consistent with big bang nucleosynthesis calculations , and the total matter content is only @xmath540% of the critical density required for a flat universe .",
    "therefore , it is clear that the major fraction of the energy density of the universe is provided by something other than matter .",
    "this is generally assumed to be a nonzero cosmological constant .",
    "the high-@xmath24 excess detected by the cbi , if real , is the most interesting result of the cmb interferometry experimental results .",
    "it is unexpected , and would likely be due to secondary anisotropy .",
    "both the suggested explanations , that it is due to the sunyaev - zeldovich effect in clusters of galaxies ( bond et  al .  2003 ) or in the aftermath of population iii stars ( oh et  al .",
    "2003 ) , would provide an important new window on the processes of structure formation ."
