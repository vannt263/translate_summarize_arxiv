    "@xmath0-simplex _ equations _ arose as fundamental equations underlying exactly solvable models in mathematical physics .",
    "first , there appeared the 2-simplex , or _",
    "triangle _ , equation , which is nothing but the famous yang ",
    "baxter equation ( ybe )  @xcite , and the second to appear was the 3-simplex , or _",
    "zamolodchikov tetrahedron _ equation ( zte )  @xcite .",
    "loosely speaking , @xmath0-simplex equations are those representable graphically with one @xmath0-simplex in its left - hand side , and the same @xmath0-simplex but turned `` inside out '' in its right - hand side . to be more exact",
    ", there are quite a few different types of @xmath0-simplex equations , of which important for us here will be :    * _ quantum _ , or _ tensor _ , equation , or equation relating some products of linear operators acting in the tensor product of vector spaces .",
    "see formula   below for a quantum _ tetrahedron _ equation , * _ set - theoretic _ equation , or equation relating the compositions of mappings of some ( usually finite ) sets .",
    "these compositions act in a suitable cartesian product of the mentioned sets .",
    "set - theoretic yang ",
    "baxter equation was introduced in  @xcite , * _ functional _ equation .",
    "this is almost the same as set - theoretic one , except that the mappings are not required to be defined everywhere .",
    "typically , they are given by _",
    "rational functions_. the functional _ tetrahedron _ equation ( fte ) , together with a rather general scheme giving its solutions , was proposed in  @xcite .",
    "different kinds of @xmath0-simplex equations prove to be closely related to each other .",
    "for instance , fte appears to provide the most fruitful way for finding solutions of the quantum tetrahedron equation ( qte ) .",
    "the first example can be found already in  @xcite ; also , the example  @xcite with _ positive boltzmann weights _",
    "( so important for statistical physics ) was constructed using the fte .",
    "many more types of @xmath0-simplex equations and their classical analogues can be found in literature .",
    "for instance , we can mention the _ classical _ yang  baxter equation used in the theory of ( classical ) solitonic equations .",
    "there are also equations in the _ direct sum _ ( rather than tensor product ) of linear spaces , see again  @xcite for a yang ",
    "baxter direct - sum example , which is also _ dynamical _ : the operators in its l.h.s .  and r.h.s",
    ".  can be different ( in contrast with the `` usual '' equations , where the operators / mappings are the same , but taken in different orders ) .",
    "also , our quantum , set - theoretic and functional equations correspond to coloring edges around a vertex or , in the dual picture , @xmath1-faces around an @xmath0-cube ( see section  [ s : n - simplex ] below ) , while there are also options of coloring faces of other dimensions .",
    "note in this connection that colors in zamolodchikov s original paper  @xcite were attached to _ two - faces_.    an @xmath0-simplex equation together with operators / mappings making its solution is called @xmath0-simplex _",
    "relation_.    besides mathematical physics , @xmath0-simplex equations / relations look very important for _ topology_. here it is quite enough to mention the connections between the jones polynomial and yang  baxter equation , see , for instance , @xcite and references therein .",
    "one direction of searching for new solutions to the @xmath0-simplex equations is suggested , on one hand , by hietarinta s _ permutation - type _ solutions  @xcite and , on another hand , by the _ quandle cohomology _",
    "@xcite and _ yang  baxter ( co)homology _  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to introduce a similar ( co)homological theory for general @xmath0-simplex relations and show how it leads to nontrivial generalizations of permutation - type solutions .",
    "although we develop a general theory , our main attention is paid to the tetrahedron case @xmath2 . also , the examples of permutation - type solutions used in this paper are our own .",
    "the organization of the rest of the paper is as follows :    * in section  [ s : tetra ] , we introduce various forms of tetrahedron equation , * in section  [ s : n - simplex ] , we generalize the set - theoretic version to any @xmath0-simplex equation , and study the related `` permitted '' colorings of a `` big - dimensional '' cube , * in section  [ s : hom ] , we define homologies and cohomologies of @xmath0-simplex relations , based on the mentioned `` permitted '' colorings , * and finally , in section  [ s : examples ] , we show how our theory can give nontrivial solutions to a quantum ( tensor ) tetrahedron equation .",
    "the tetrahedron equation  ( te ) arose initially ( in one of its versions ) in zamolodchikov s paper  @xcite where he considered the scattering of straight strings in @xmath3 dimensions . as te is a higher - dimensional analogue of yang ",
    "baxter equation , it is believed to find , similarly to ybe , its applications to solvable models in statistical physics and quantum field theory ; also applications to topology are likely to be developed .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we write out here , first , the quantum constant version of te : @xmath4 here both sides are operators in the @xmath5th tensor degree of a linear space  @xmath6 ; we write it as @xmath7 where @xmath8 are six copies of  @xmath9 ; each separate  @xmath10 is a copy of one and the same linear operator @xmath11 ( hence the name `` constant equation '' ) , acting nontrivially in @xmath12 , and tensor multiplied by identity operators in the remaining  @xmath9 s .",

    "we will consider such operators in more detail in subsection  [ ss : qte - cocycles ] . on the other hand , there exist much more general solutions of qte that can not be reduced to an stte .",

    "+ + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    our third type of tetrahedron equation is fte  the functional tetrahedron equation .",
    "this is the same as stte except that the mapping  @xmath20 may be defined `` almost everywhere '' rather than be a mapping between sets in the strict sense .",
    "typically , @xmath15 is in this situation a field like @xmath25 or  @xmath26 , and @xmath20 is a rational function",
    ". one popular solution to fte is the following `` electric '' solution : @xmath27 we call it `` electric '' because it comes from the well known _",
    "transformation in electric circuits , see  @xcite .",
    "we will show in subsection  [ ss : sol ] how a genuine bijective map between sets can be fabricated from the rational mapping  .",
    "one more way to represent equation   graphically is _ dual _ to figure  [ f : t ] and goes as follows .",
    "consider a @xmath28-dimensional cube .",
    "its orthogonal projection onto a three - dimensional space along its ( body ) diagonal is a rhombic dodecahedron , wherein its eight three - dimensional faces become eight parallelepipeds . in this way",
    ", our rhombic dodecahedron turns out to be divided into four parallelepipeds in two different ways , see figure  [ f : r ] , where the indices at vertices indicate the vertex coordinates in  @xmath29 .",
    "we now position our rhombic dodecahedron in the three - space in such way that it will have @xmath5 visible and @xmath5 invisible 2-faces .",
    "paint the visible faces in @xmath5 colors @xmath30 from the set  @xmath15 as shown in the upper part of figure  [ f : f ]    ]    ( where a flat projection of rhombic dodecahedron is pictured , in the shape of regular octagon ) .",
    "consider one of two partitionings of the rhombic dodecahedron into parallelepipeds , depicted in figure  [ f : r ] .",
    "as we see , the colors of three front ( visible ) faces of one parallelepiped in this partitioning are @xmath31 .",
    "color then its three remaining faces with colors @xmath32 ( obtained from @xmath31 by applying the mapping  @xmath20 , compare  ) respectively .",
    "now there has appeared a parallelepiped whose three visible faces are colored with @xmath33 , while its three invisible faces are not yet colored .",
    "we color them in @xmath34 , and so on .",
    "this process is represented in the left column in figure  [ f : f ] ( the already used faces are not pictured ) .",
    "we could , however , begin the process from the parallelepiped whose visible faces have colors @xmath35 , and thus obtain the sequence of transformations in the right column .",
    "it is not hard to see that the tetrahedron equation states exactly that the final result  the coloring of the invisible part of the rhombic dodecahedron surface ( shown below in figure  [ f : f ] )  is the same in both cases . besides , if we consider the coloring of all the involved 2-faces , including those which we used in passing , we get the coloring of all 2-faces of the tesseract ( i.e. , four - dimensional cube ) meeting the condition that , for any 3-face , the coloring of its three `` back '' faces is obtained by applying the mapping  @xmath20 onto the colors of three `` front '' faces .    note also that we could write , instead of our equation  , any other equation obtained from it using index permutations",
    "indeed , the group  @xmath36 acts on the cartesian product  @xmath21 by permutations and , clearly , the conjugation by an element @xmath37 preserves the structure of equation  .",
    "we call below any such equation tetrahedron equation .",
    "both yang  baxter and tetrahedron relations are particular cases of their natural generalization  the @xmath0-simplex relation . in this section",
    ", we first do some preparatory work in subsection  [ ss:0 ] .",
    "then we define the @xmath0-simplex relation , in its set - theoretic version , in subsection  [ ss : ur ] .",
    "this goes in the style of subsection  [ ss : tf ]  using face colorings of a cube . finally , we investigate some specific colorings of @xmath1-faces in a cube of `` big '' dimension  @xmath38 in subsection  [ ss : po ] .",

    "denote the numbers of positions of asterisks in sequence  @xmath59 as @xmath62 .",

    ".  of equation   coincides with  @xmath64 , then the face  @xmath65 is called _ incoming _ for  @xmath58 ; if not , it is called _",
    "outgoing_.    the motivation for this definition will become clear when we introduce the set - theoretic @xmath0-simplex equation in subsection  [ ss : ur ] .",
    "note that any @xmath0-face of cube @xmath40 , @xmath66 , has @xmath67 subfaces of dimension  @xmath1 , of which @xmath0 are incoming and @xmath0 are outgoing .",

    "next comes one more important definition :    [ dfn : abs ] an @xmath1-face is called _ absolutely incoming _ if it has the maximal possible order @xmath71 , i.e. , it is incoming for all @xmath0-faces containing it .",

    "we are going to show that , for any @xmath1-direction , there exists exactly one absolutely incoming ( or absolutely outgoing ) @xmath1-face parallel to it .",
    "indeed , a face is parallel to a direction @xmath74 provided the asterisks  @xmath75 in the corresponding sequence  @xmath76 stand at the positions @xmath77 ( and only there ) .",
    "any @xmath0-face containing a given @xmath1-face is characterized by the fact that the corresponding sequence  @xmath59 has , in addition to the asterisks in  @xmath76 ( sequence for the mentioned @xmath1-face ) , one more asterisk that can stand at any of the remaining @xmath71 positions .",
    "the condition that a given @xmath1-face is incoming ( or outgoing ) for an @xmath0-face containing it , determines unambiguously the symbol standing in  @xmath76 at the position of the `` extra '' asterisk in  @xmath59 .",
    "thus , the sequence  @xmath76 is restored unambiguously from the set of indices @xmath77 and the condition of being absolutely incoming ( or outgoing ) .",
    "we are going to give a `` geometrical '' definition of @xmath0-simplex equation , in analogy with that for tetrahedron equation in subsection  [ ss : tf ] .",
    "we start with the definition of _ coloring _ of the @xmath38-cube .",
    "[ dfn : clr ] _ coloring _ of @xmath1-faces in cube  @xmath40 is a mapping from the set of these faces into a fixed finite set  @xmath15  _ color set_. we call a coloring of @xmath1-faces @xmath1-coloring or even simply coloring , if the value of  @xmath0 is clear from the context .",
    "now choose an arbitrary @xmath0-face  @xmath78 ; it contains @xmath0 incoming and @xmath0 outgoing @xmath1-faces ( see definition  [ dfn : io ] and the following remark ) .",
    "so , a coloring of either all incoming or all outgoing faces is given by an element of the cartesian degree  @xmath79 .",
    "[ dfn : r ] _ set - theoretic @xmath20-operator _ is a mapping @xmath80 producing the colors of outgoing @xmath1-faces in  @xmath58 if the colors of incoming faces are given .",

    ", conditions on different @xmath0-faces must not contradict each other .",
    "it turns out that just one condition on the @xmath20-operator is enough for this , and this is exactly what we will call the set - theoretical @xmath0-simplex equation .    to introduce this equation , consider an @xmath81-cube  @xmath82 .",
    "build the following directed graph , which we will call  @xmath83 : first , take all @xmath0-faces of  @xmath82 as its _",
    "vertices_. then , consider those @xmath1-faces that are outgoing for one @xmath0-face and incoming for another , and take them as the graph  @xmath83 _ edges _ , joining the two mentioned @xmath0-faces and directed from the first of them to the second .",
    "it turns out that  @xmath83 consists of two @xmath0-simplices , one of them `` turned inside out '' with respect to the other ( compare figure  [ f : t ] ) , as the following theorem states .",
    "we continue to use the notations introduced in subsection  [ ss:0 ] , writing the faces of  @xmath82 as sequences of @xmath57 symbols @xmath47 , @xmath48 or  @xmath49 .",
    "[ thm : n - simp ] graph  @xmath83 consists of two connected components , each being an @xmath0-simplex . to one of them  we will call it the _ left - hand - side _ component  belong the @xmath0-faces ( graph vertices ) having zero at an odd position or unity at an even position : @xmath84 the rest of @xmath0-faces , i.e. , @xmath85 belong to the other component , called the _ right - hand - side _ component .    moreover , let us say that @xmath86 for two vertices @xmath87 if one can get from @xmath88 to  @xmath89 along ( a sequence of ) _ directed _ edges .",
    "then @xmath90 makes a linear order on any of the connected components , namely , @xmath91 in the l.h.s . , and @xmath92 in the r.h.s .",
    "the simplest example  graph  @xmath93 , consisting of two triangles  is pictured in figure  [ f : c ] .    .",
    "sequences encoding edges are written near the corresponding arrows ; graph vertices denote 2-faces . ]",
    "consider the set   of graph  @xmath83 vertices .",
    "there are clearly @xmath57 of them .",
    "first , we show that , for any two of them , call them @xmath88 and  @xmath89 , if @xmath89 is to the right of  @xmath88 in   ( although not necessarily its nearest neighbor ! ) , then there exists an edge joining @xmath88 and  @xmath89 directly and pointing from @xmath88 to  @xmath89 .",
    "indeed , one can check that the _ intersection of @xmath0-faces _ @xmath88 and  @xmath89 is exactly an @xmath1-face outgoing for  @xmath88 and incoming for  @xmath89  this becomes an easy exercise if we note that the sequences in   and their @xmath1-faces are obtained from the sequence @xmath94 by replacing all the symbols , except one or two , with  @xmath75 , and then directly apply definition  [ dfn : io ] .",
    "so , restricting the set of vertices to those in   and considering only edges joining these vertices , we have an @xmath0-simplex , as desired .",
    "similar reasoning is valid , of course , also for the set  .    what remains",
    "to prove is that there are no more edges ( that would join the two already obtained @xmath0-simplices ) . indeed , taking now @xmath0-face  @xmath88 from   and @xmath0-face  @xmath89 from   ( obtained from the sequence @xmath94 or , respectively , @xmath95 by replacing all the symbols , except one , with  @xmath75 ) and applying again definition  [ dfn : io ] , one can check that @xmath96 is either incoming or outgoing for _ both _ @xmath88 and  @xmath89 .",
    "[ dfn : n - simp ] _ set - theoretic ( constant ) @xmath0-simplex equation _ on a color set  @xmath15 is the following equality between two compositions of @xmath20-operators , acting in the increasing order ( from right to left ! ) in the sense of and  : @xmath97 each @xmath20 is a copy of the same @xmath20-operator but acting on the colors within the @xmath0-face in its subscript .",
    "thus , the l.h.s .  of",
    "the set - theoretic @xmath0-simplex equation corresponds graphically to the left - hand - side component of  @xmath83 , and the r.h.s .",
    "similarly to the right - hand - side component .",
    "the following geometric interpretation can also be given to the definitions in this subsection .",
    "we define the _ orientation _ of any @xmath44-face in cube  @xmath40 , assuming that its edges go along the axes @xmath98 , with @xmath99 , as follows : it is determined by the @xmath44-tuple @xmath100 of unit vectors going along these axes and taken exactly in this order of increasing indices .",
    "to be more exact , we identify @xmath100 with the standard basis @xmath101 in  @xmath102 , and thus carry over the standard orientation of  @xmath102 onto the face .",
    "any subface @xmath103 gets thus two orientations : one from  @xmath40 and one from  @xmath104 ; these orientations , of course , coincide .",
    "as @xmath39 has its standard orientation as well , choosing face orientation is equivalent to choosing an orientation in the complementary space .",
    "below we assume that we compose the basis in  @xmath39 , taking first the vectors @xmath100 , and then the basis in the complementary space ; this must give the correct orientation of  @xmath39 .",
    "in particular , if @xmath105 , then the face orientation is equivalent to choosing a direction of the normal to the face .",
    "as the orientations of opposite faces clearly coincide , we see that one half of normals to the @xmath0-faces of @xmath81-cube look into that cube , while the other half look outside .",
    "we then say that faces looking inside correspond , by definition , to the l.h.s .  of our equation",
    ", while those looking outside  to the r.h.s .    then , we define , for every @xmath0-face ( recall that it must correspond to one @xmath20-operator ) _ its incoming and outgoing _ @xmath1-faces . we do it along the same lines as in the previous paragraph : those whose normals ( drawn within the @xmath0-face under consideration ) point inside are incoming , while the rest are outgoing .",
    "important is that the orientations of all @xmath0-faces in either side of our equation are obviously _ consistent _ ! and this means that if an @xmath1-face is common for two @xmath0-faces , then it is incoming for one of them and outgoing to the other .",
    "it is not hard to check that this way we can come to the definition of @xmath0-simplex equation equivalent to the above .      the main result of this subsection is the following theorem , forming the basis for homological constructions in section  [ s : hom ] .",
    "[ thm : vse ] assume that @xmath15 is a set , equipped with an operation @xmath106 , for which the @xmath0-simplex equation holds .",
    "then for every @xmath15-coloring of absolutely incoming @xmath1-faces of @xmath40 there is a unique permitted @xmath15-coloring of all @xmath1-faces of the @xmath38-cube .",

    "we shall prove two important properties of this graph :    [ l : acycl ] there are no oriented cycles in  @xmath107 ( loosely speaking , you can not return to the starting point , if you follow the arrows of the graph ) .",
    "consider a point , `` traveling '' along the edges of the graph  @xmath107 .",
    "one can describe the steps of such `` travel '' as follows :    * when you move from an @xmath0-face to an @xmath1-face you replace one of the stars @xmath49 in the corresponding sequence @xmath110 by @xmath48 or @xmath47 , depending on whether the star was on an odd or even place in the set of stars inside @xmath110 , when you count from the left ; * when you move from an @xmath1-face to an @xmath0-face you replace one of the digits in @xmath110 by the star @xmath49 ; the digit should be by @xmath48 or @xmath47 , depending on whether the new star takes an even or odd place in the set of stars inside @xmath110 , when you count from the left .",
    "assume that we have made several steps of the sort we have just described : @xmath111 .",
    "we can regard this process as a chain of changes within the same sequence @xmath110 .",
    "suppose , that in the end all the `` stars '' in the sequence @xmath110 are at their original places , i.e. that the places , occupied by symbols @xmath49 in @xmath112 and in @xmath113 are the same ( we do nt assume anything about the rest of the sequence ) . in particular , the corresponding faces have the same dimension .",
    "let @xmath114 be the leftmost position in the sequence @xmath115 , which changed at least once in the process of transformations ( i.e. all the symbols on the left from @xmath114 in all sequences @xmath116 coincide ) .",
    "we can assume that the number of stars on the left of @xmath114 is _ even _ ( the odd case can be treated similarly ) .",
    "now , if we replace a star by a digit at the @xmath114-th place , this digit should be equal to @xmath48 ; if a digit at @xmath114 is replaced by star , then the digit should be equal to @xmath47 .",
    "thus it is evident that we can not return back to @xmath110 in this way .",
