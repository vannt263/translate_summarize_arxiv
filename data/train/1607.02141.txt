    "the ratio of these two quantities ( bottom panel ) shows the signatures of a recent star formation episode ( within @xmath148 kpc ) which transformed into stars the gas torqued down by the bar gravitational effect .",

    "@xcite already showed that the star formation rate and the black hole accretion rate increase after @xmath150 , which is when the bar is reaching maximum strength ( see figure [ a2r2fig ] ) .",

    "figure [ bhgrowth ] ( upper panel ) shows the black hole accretion rate as a function of redshift from the last minor merger to @xmath5 .",
    "@xmath153 is generally very low , fluctuating about @xmath155 with the exception of some isolated spikes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this implies a modest growth of the black hole mass after @xmath156 , which undergoes a total increment of about @xmath152 of its final value ( lower panel ) .",
    "a slight change in the accretion regime can be observed during the bar growth phase for @xmath157 .",
    "the accretion rate results , however , in a luminosity lower than @xmath158 of the mbh eddington limit , assuming a radiative efficiency of @xmath159 .",
    "this further support the picture in which the gas within the reach of the bar torques falls into the centre of the galaxy and is promptly consumed by nuclear star formation bursts , while only a very small fraction of it fuels the nuclear accretion process . as the gas infall proceeds all the way to the center it leaves behind a low gas density region ,",
    "a  dead zone  visible in at 400 pc - 2 kpc in figure 8 , within which star formation can not be further sustained @xcite .",
    "the bar in erisbh does not extend out to its corotational radius ( see fig  [ growth ] ) , i.e. its precession period is shorter than the orbital period of the outer gas . as a consequence",
    "the bar exerts a positive torque onto the outer gas , preventing any further gas infall that could potentially replenish the dead zone . on the contrary",
    ", the formation of new stars proceeds unimpeded outside the region affected by the bar . to further support this picture figure  [ sfmap ] shows the density weighted map of the stellar ages at the end of the simulation .",
    "a population of young stars is clearly visible in the outer regions of the galaxy , while only old stars are present in the dead region .",
    "a nuclear ( @xmath65 kpc ) , elongated structure with intermediate age stars is visible at the centre of the galaxy , in which the stars forming at the bar onset contribute to the average age .",
    "a qualitative comparison with the similar structure of ngc 1073 is shown in figure  [ sfmap ] . the outer disk in ngc 1073 is mostly composed of star formation regions which host young stellar populations .",
    "on the contrary , a bar structure is evident in the galaxy centre where the almost - exclusive presence of old and red stars is a prominent feature .",
    "we analyzed the high - resolution cosmological eris__bh _ _ run @xcite , which closely resembles an sb / sc galaxy with stellar mass and rotation velocity comparable to our milky way . at @xmath5 the galaxy forming at the centre of the refined region features a strong nuclear ( @xmath160 kpc ) bar which is able to strongly influence : @xmath31 the dynamics of the stellar disk , including the formation of a b / p bulge in its centre ; @xmath32 the dynamics of the gas within the central @xmath122 kpc , which falls towards the galactic centre triggering a short burst of star formation in the galactic nucleus ( within @xmath161 pc ) as soon as the bar starts growing ; @xmath34 the late star formation in the central @xmath162 kpc .",
    "this is the consequence of the fast gas removal operated by the bar preventing any strong star formation episode after its formation .",
    "the analysis of the torques operated by the bar supports the notion that the bar efficiently drives gas inflows down to the resolution limit ( @xmath42 hundreds of pc , due to the absence of any clear ilr ) at any @xmath120 .",
    "the absence of an intense star formation activity in the central regions of the disk as well as of strong agn activity is purely due to the absence of dense gas within the bar extent due to rapid consumption by star formation at the onset of bar formation .",
    "the lack of a clear observational correlation between agn activity and the occurrence of bars in galaxies ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for the different point of views ) could be related to the prompt removal of gas .",
    "if we assume the results of eris__bh _ _ appy to the whole class of field disk galaxies in low density environments , we argue that the stronger gas inflow and enahnced star formation happen at the onset of bar formation , when the detection of a bar is more difficult as the bar is shorter and less regular in shape . instead ,",
    "when the bar is stronger and well - developed , hence easily determined from photometry or imaging , star formation has already ceased creating a `` dead zone '' in the galactic centre and making the occurrence of any nuclear activity less probable ( see e.g. the discussion in * ? ? ?",
    "strong bars may arise at earlier times in more massive galaxies or galaxies living in dense environments , which evolve on shorter dynamical timescales .",
    "hence we argue that bar formation can contribute to quenching and the formation of `` red nuggets '' at @xmath163 , as also suggested by the results of the argo simulations which exhibit several example of early bar formation leading to increased central baryonic densities ( fiacconi , feldmann & mayer 2015 ) .",
    "bar - driven quenching should thus be seen as an alternative to mergers , disk fragmentation into massive clumps and agn feedback , the main mechanisms explored in the literature over the last few years .",
    "of course bar - driven quenching is related to feedback mechanisms operating in the central region , as it seems to be the case in eris__bh _ _ where agn feedback might be instrumental in creating favourable conditions for bar formation at later stages .",
    "since bar - formation requires a kinematically cold , thin disk to occur , it remains to be seen if this can be achieved by the latest generation of strong feedback models adopted in galaxy formation simulations .",
    "it is interesting to note that such a strong bar is absent in the eris run , which differs from eris__bh _ _ only because it does not feature any mbh accretion and feedback prescription .",
    "this would seem to be at odd with the limited gas accretion occurring onto the central mbh @xcite , that would imply a moderate effect of agn feedback onto the host galaxy",
    ". however , at @xmath163 there are transient near - eddington accretion phases which ought to have an effect on the build - up of the central baryonic distribution .",
    "indeed at @xmath164 eris__bh _ _ has a much flatter rotation curve near the center as a result of the suppressed growth of the central baryonic density .",
    "the actual trigger of bar growth is still to be pinpointed . the main galaxy in the eris__bh _ _ run becomes bar unstable at large redshift ( see figure  [ growth ] ) , but the bar structure forms only after the last minor merger episode . as discussed in section  [ sfc_dnst ] , the properties of the bar do resemble those predicted for a tidally induced one .",
    "whether the merger itself does provide the trigger for the instability to grow is unclear , as it is impossible to definitively constrain the time in between the merger and the actual onset of the bar growth . in order to test the possible tidal nature of the bar we plan to run a set of simulations restarting the eris__bh _ _ run before the merger , removing the particles forming the satellite , and checking whether the bar grows regardless of the perturbation .    in conclusion , the present analysis of the eris__bh _",
    "_ run has demonstrated that a bar resulting from the fully cosmological evolution of adisk galaxy with quiet merger history strongly affects its host , in particular by quenching its star formation on kpc scales .",
    "this result provides further theoretical support to the recent claim by @xcite that bars are one of the main contributor of the flattening observed at high masses in the star formation rate - stellar mass correlation @xcite .",
