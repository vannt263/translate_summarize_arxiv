    "the sudbury neutrino observatory ( sno )  @xcite , a 1000 t d@xmath0o cerenkov detector located 2 km underground ( 6010 m water equivalent ) in sudbury , canada , is sensitive to @xmath1b solar neutrinos via the interactions @xmath6 where @xmath7 represents all active neutrino flavours .",
    "whereas the charged current ( cc ) interaction is only sensitive to @xmath8 neutrinos , the neutral current ( nc ) interaction is equally sensitive to all active neutrino flavours .",
    "this sensitivity to non-@xmath8 neutrinos , combined with the precise @xmath8 flux measurement from the cc channel , gives sno the unique ability to test the hypothesis that a portion of the @xmath8 s produced in the sun undergo flavour change while in transit to earth .",
    "the elastic scattering ( es ) interaction does have some sensitivity to non-@xmath8 neutrinos but for sno is a low statistics channel .",
    "since the standard solar model predicts a negligible flux of non-@xmath8 neutrinos , a non - zero difference between the total flux of active neutrinos from the nc channel and the flux of electron neutrinos from the cc channel would provide a clear indication of neutrino flavour transformation .",
    "sno has nearly completed the second of the first two phases of data taking .",
    "results from the initial ` pure d@xmath0o ' phase , in which the central target consisted solely of purified heavy water , are described in the next section of this document .",
    "the final section provides an update of the status of the second ` salt phase ' in which the characteristic response of nc events has been altered by the addition of nacl to the d@xmath0o .",
    "the sno detector consists of 9456 photo - multiplier tube ( pmt ) and light concentrator units arrayed on a geodesic support structure .",
    "this array surrounds a 1700 t spherical shell of light water , which in turn encloses the spherical acrylic vessel containing the 1000 t of heavy water .",
    "electrons produced in the d@xmath0o emit a cone of cerenkov light which is detected by the pmt s .",
    "neutrons produced in the detector can be captured by a deuteron which subsequently emits a 6.25 mev photon .",
    "photons interact with electrons in the d@xmath0o via compton scattering and these electrons are detected as described above .",
    "the event energy is approximately linearly related to the number of pmt s registering light .",
    "vertex positions and event directions are reconstructed via fitting algorithms which use the relative pmt positions and firing times to reconstruct the cerenkov cone .    in order to understand the detector response and systematic uncertainties ,",
    "a series of calibration sources are placed at various positions within the detector volume .",
    "analyses of the calibration data and comparisons with monte carlo simulated events are then carried out .",
    "the optical properties of the detector are evaluated by transmitting laser light at wavelengths between 337 - 620 nm into the d@xmath0o volume via optical fibers affixed to a glass diffusing ball .",
    "the response of the pmt array , for various positions of the diffusing ball , is evaluated and the optical properties of the detector measured .    in order to set the absolute energy scale and to evaluate energy scale and resolution uncertainties , an @xmath9n source@xcite , which emits 6.13 mev photons , is utilized .",
    "these studies are supplemented by @xmath1li source  @xcite runs in which @xmath10 s with an end point near 14 mev are produced and @xmath11h(p,@xmath12)@xmath13he(`pt ' ) source  @xcite runs in which 19.8 mev photons are emitted .",
    "in addition to the energy response , these sources are also used to determine the reconstructed event vertex and event direction detector response and uncertainties .",
    "the nc flux measurement requires an understanding of the detector neutron capture efficiency .",
    "a @xmath14cf source is introduced at various positions within the detector to produce a known quantity of neutrons and analysis of this data provides a measurement of the capture efficiency and uncertainties .",
    "evaluations of backgrounds in the data set are carried out through a variety of ex - situ and in - situ analyses .",
    "instrumental backgrounds are evaluated through an examination of calibration data and a series of selection cuts adopted to suppress them .",
    "ex - situ measurements using ion exchange and membrane degassing techniques coupled with in - situ analyses of the sno low - energy signal region are employed to estimate the level of radioactive thorium and uranium backgrounds .",
    "these backgrounds give rise to photons that contaminate the low - energy region of the sno spectrum and , more crucially , can cause photo - disintegration of the deuterons inducing a neutron background signal indistinguishable from nc events .",
    ".[tab : sys]the primary systematic uncertainties on the extracted charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) neutrino fluxes are presented .",
    "in addition , the uncertainties on the measured non - electron neutrino flux ( @xmath15 ) are given .",
    "the total uncertainty for the elastic scattering flux ( es - not shown ) is -4.8,+5.0 percent . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : mcresults ]    interestingly , when the energy pdf s are not included in the fit the cc uncertainty does not increase appreciably and the nc uncertainty remains substantially better than in the pure d@xmath0o phase .",
    "hence with the salt phase data a precision measurement will be made with no assumptions on the shapes of the signal energy distributions .",
    "precise measurements of the cc and nc fluxes from the pure d@xmath0o phase of sno running have been presented .",
    "these results can be translated into values for electron neutrino and non - electron neutrino fluxes .",
    "the measurement of a statistically significant non - electron neutrino flux provides strong evidence for flavour transformation of electron neutrinos produced in the sun and can be consistent with an msw oscillation model .",
    "the @xmath1b shape constrained measurement of the total @xmath1b neutrino flux is consistent with standard solar model predictions . the unconstrained measurement , while still consistent , is dominated by statistical uncertainties .    various aspects of detector calibration and response for the salt phase",
    "have been presented including energy scale , angular resolution , and neutron response .",
    "as indicated , the salt phase detector response is well understood and these analyses are in an advanced stage in preparation for the forthcoming initial salt phase publication .",
    "mc studies indicate that 1 year of salt livetime will produce a cc result with similar statistical precision as the pure d@xmath0o phase and an nc result with substantially improved statistical precision .",
    "note that the currently published nc measurement uncertainty is dominated by statistics .",
    "in addition , it has been demonstrated that a precision energy - unconstrained fit can be made with the salt phase data .",
