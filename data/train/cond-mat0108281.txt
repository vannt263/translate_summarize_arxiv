    "in recent years there has been considerable interest in the nature of posture sway  @xcite .",
    "sway is the name given to the small dynamic displacement fluctuations present in the posture coordinates of a person who is otherwise standing quietly .",
    "some studies have been motivated ( in part ) by a practical medical problem , i.e. the consequences of falling for the elderly population  @xcite .",
    "such falls are frequent events .",
    "medical studies show that @xmath0 of the elderly population experience a fall at least once a year causing fractures , contusions , head injuries , joint distortions and dislocations  @xcite .",
    "the medical costs in the united sates are @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "these figures suggest the desirability of a reliable screening technique for determining balance impairment , especially among the elderly . our purpose is to present experimental evidence concerning the connection between noise processes in posture sway and the probability of falling .",
    "some theoretical notions concerning this connection have been previously discussed  @xcite .    in sec.ii , the experimental methods employed in measuring posture sway coordinates are discussed .",
    "the central instrument involved in the measurement is a sound wave assessment device ( swa ) . in sec.iii , the free energy barrier model  @xcite for computing the probability of a fall",
    "is discussed .",
    "the most important posture parameter determining the probability of a fall is the root - mean - square ( rms ) velocity @xmath2 of the fluctuating anteroposterior ( back and forth ) posture oscillation mode .",
    "the probability for a fall is to be described by the function @xmath3 where @xmath4 is proportional to the height of an energy barrier preventing a fall .",
    "eq.(1 ) will be simply derived in what follows , but here one may note that @xmath5 gives rise to a single parameter fit to the data on posture sway and the probability of a fall .",
    "a maximum likelihood analysis of @xmath6 from experimental data is discussed in sec.iv . in the concluding sec.v",
    ", we discuss the utility of the energy barrier view in predicting the fallers within the elderly population .",
    "the swa device consists of two small ultrasonic transducers of the type used by polaroid for auto - focusing cameras .",
    "each transducer is able to emit and detect ultrasonic pulses at @xmath7 . when positioned some distance apart ,",
    "say @xmath8 , the transducers are able to determine the distance between them by measuring the time it takes for a pulse to propagate from one transducer to the other .",
    "the position accuracy of such a measurement is @xmath9 .",
    "the above technique is well suited for the measurement of the fine movements of subjects during quiet standing .",
    "one transducer is attached to the lower back ( around the waist line ) of a subject .",
    "the other transducer is positioned on a stable laboratory stand .",
    "the duration of the quiet standing measurement is 60 seconds .",
    "the subjects participating in this study were 56 mature adults of ages from @xmath10 to @xmath11 residing in independent community residential facilities .",
    "the subjects filled out a questionnaire in order to determine their medical history and their history of falls .",
    "the subjects included in the study all had good ability to follow directions , good visual activity , good hearing and the ability to stand without assistance for at least 60 seconds . excluded were subjects who had unstable cardiac diseases , orthostatic hypertension , severe neurological diseases , blindness , diabetes , mental diseases , or lower extremities amputations .",
    "the subjects were asked to stand for one minute while their movement ( back and forth ) in the anteroposterior direction was measured - i.e. the posture coordinate displacement @xmath12 was recorded .",
    "the time interval @xmath13 between displacement measurements was @xmath14 .",
    "the rms velocity @xmath15 was determined from the measured displacements and time intervals between displacement measurements .",
    "the measured rms velocity @xmath2 was recorded within a bin of size @xmath16 . in the @xmath17 data bin of rms velocity @xmath18 ,",
    "@xmath19 subjects were studied . of these",
    ", @xmath20 subjects indicated that they had a fall within the last year .",
    "the measured probability for falling within a year was taken to be the fraction @xmath21 .",
    "the physical kinetics of thermally activated processes is often modeled using a free energy of activation @xmath22 and a temperature @xmath23 .",
    "the arrhenius law for the probability @xmath24 of overcoming a local activation barrier and falling from a meta - stable free energy to a lower stable free energy is given by @xmath25 the temperature in the arrhenius law represents the thermal rms velocity @xmath26 of the coordinate describing the free energy barrier ; i.e. for a coordinate associated with a mass @xmath27 , the equipartition theorem of statistical mechanics asserts that @xmath28 expressing the energy barrier in terms of a `` velocity '' @xmath5 via @xmath29 yields @xmath30    our model eq.(1 ) is merely eqs.(2 ) and ( 5 ) in thinly disguised form .",
    "however , the following physical points are worthy of note : ( i ) the `` noise temperature '' @xmath31 ( with @xmath32 ) of living beings is _ not _ the environmental temperature @xmath23 .",
    "an object in thermal equilibrium with its environment is dead@xcite .",
    "the measured rms velocity @xmath2 of the living subjects represents noise but not thermal noise .",
    "( ii ) the velocity @xmath5 ( assumed independent of noise temperature ) is still determined by the energy barrier which prevents us from falling without ( say ) being pushed .",
    "the potential energy and energy barriers , at various measured posture coordinate @xmath33 values , describes a combination of motions of the ankles and hips  @xcite . the motions ( referred to as `` strategies '' in the biomedical literature )",
    "are familiar to many casual observers .",
    "a loss of balance may often be preceded by large amplitude rocking back and forth ( without stepping protections ) before the final fall actually takes place .    the theoretical probability for a fall as a function of rms velocity is shown in fig .",
    "1 . note that the probability for a fall becomes appreciable when the rms velocity @xmath2 is somewhat greater than half the value of @xmath5 .",
    "the experimental determination of @xmath5 is thereby of great interest .",
    "for @xmath34 subjects having an rms velocities @xmath35 , the total probability of having @xmath36 falling subjects is theoretically given by the binomial distribution @xmath37 where @xmath38    the likelihood of a particular value of the parameter @xmath5 is obtained from the probability distribution @xmath39 in eq.(6 ) by inserting the experimental data @xmath40 into @xmath41,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is an arbitrary constant .",
    "the likelihood function @xmath43 for the data at hand is plotted in fig .",
    "the likelihood @xmath43 has a well defined peak at @xmath44 which ( in this analysis ) is the best value of @xmath5 for fitting the experimental data .",
    "the likelihood peak gives rise to a clear picture of the uncertainty in the value of @xmath5 .",
    "if one draws a horizontal line on the likelihood plot with @xmath45 of the area under the likelihood peak being above the horizontal line , then one obtains upper and lower bounds to @xmath5 by the two intersections of the line with the likelihood peak .",
    "the upper and lower bounds are thereby estimated with a confidence level of @xmath45 .    shown in fig .",
    "3 are three plots of the probability for a fall , together with the experimental points @xmath46 the solid curve is the fit of the theoretical `` probability of a fall '' curve in fig .",
    "1 with the experimental data points employing the value of @xmath6 determined by the maximum likelihood in fig 2 .",
    "the upper and lower bounds are shown by dashed curves also obtained from the likelihood curve at a confidence level of @xmath47 . given the number of tested subjects , the agreement between theory and experiment is satisfactory .",
    "higher numbers of subjects would be expected to improve the analysis by somewhat narrowing the likelihood peak .",
    "experimental evidence has been presented relating the rms velocity @xmath2 of the anteroposterior posture oscillation mode to the probability of a fall . in terms of the noise temperature of this posture mode",
    "@xmath48 the data can be reasonably understood on the basis of random velocity fluctuations providing kinetic energy .",
    "the kinetic energy can then activate a transition over that potential energy barrier which normally keeps subjects in a metastable standing mode .",
    "the probability for a fall then follows an activation law    while the single parameter @xmath5 gives a reasonable picture of the probability of a fall as shown in fig . 3 ,",
    "several other parameters have been examined but play a minor role in determining the probability for a fall .",
    "these other factors include the expressed fear of falling , self perception of balancing ability , the mass body index and muscle strength .",
    "the existence of an energy barrier to a fall is susceptible to further experiments .",
    "if one leans forward or backward beyond a certain critical displacement , then balance is lost unless one employs the step strategy . by measuring the potential energy change required to reach this critical displacement ,",
    "the quantity @xmath5 can be estimated .",
