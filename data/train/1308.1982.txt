    "in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite and in spinfoam models @xcite , convex polyhedra are fundamental objects .",
    "specifically , the intertwiners between rotation - group representations that feature in these theories can be viewed as quantum versions of convex polyhedra .",
    "this makes the parametrization of such shapes a subject of interest for the lqg community .    in kinematical lqg , one deals with @xmath1 intertwiners , which correspond to 3d polyhedra in a local 3d euclidean frame @xcite .",
    "these polyhedra are naturally parametrized in terms of area - normal vectors : each face @xmath2 is associated with a vector @xmath3 , such that its norm equals the face area @xmath4 , and its direction is orthogonal to the face .",
    "the area normals must satisfy a `` closure constraint '' : @xmath5 minkowski s reconstruction theorem guarantees a one - to - one correspondence between space - spanning sets of vectors @xmath3 that satisfy and convex polyhedra with a spatial orientation . in lqg ,",
    "the vectors @xmath3 correspond to @xmath1 fluxes .",
    "the closure condition then encodes the gauss constraint , which also generates spatial rotations of the polyhedron .    in the eprl / fk spinfoam @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath1 intertwiners get lifted into @xmath0 and acted on by @xmath0 ( lorentz ) rotations .",
    "geometrically , this endows the polyhedra with an orientation in the local 3 + 1d minkowski frame of a spinfoam vertex .",
    "the polyhedron s orientation is now correlated with those of the other polyhedra surrounding the vertex , so that together they define a generalized 4-polytope ( there are issues with shape - matching on shared faces , which are cleanly resolved only in 4-simplices ) . in analogy with the spatial case",
    ", a polyhedron with spacetime orientation can be parametrized by a set of area - normal _ simple bivectors _ @xmath6 .",
    "in addition to closure , these bivectors must also satisfy a cross - simplicity constraint : @xmath7 for a discussion of the associated phase space , see e.g. @xcite .    in this paper , we present a different parametrization of convex spacelike polyhedra with spacetime orientation . instead of bivectors",
    "@xmath6 , we associate null vectors @xmath8 to the polyhedron s faces .",
    "this parametrization does not require any constraints between the variables on different faces ( except for non - degeneracy ) .",
    "it is unusual in that both the area and the full orientation of each face are functions of the data on _ all _ the faces .",
    "our construction , like the area - vector and area - bivector constructions above , is dimension - independent .",
    "thus , we parametrize @xmath9-dimensional convex spacelike polytopes with @xmath10-dimensional faces , oriented in a @xmath11-dimensional minkowski spacetime .",
    "the parametrization is detailed in section [ sec : param ] .    in section [ sec : simplex ]",
    ", we use these variables to construct an action principle for a lorentzian 4-simplex ( or its analogue in different dimensions ) .",
    "our action principle reproduces the large - spin behavior @xcite of the barrett - crane spinfoam vertex @xcite .",
    "in particular , it recovers the regge action for classical simplicial gravity @xcite , up to a possible sign and the existence of additional , degenerate solutions .    in @xmath12 spatial dimensions ,",
    "our parametrization is not really new .",
    "it is secretly contained in the spinor - based description @xcite of lqg intertwiners .",
    "there , the face normals from are constructed as squares of spinors ( which have an additional phase degree of freedom in @xmath13 ) .",
    "it was noticed that the closure constraint in these variables can always be satisfied by acting on the spinors with an @xmath0 boost . for details at various stages of the spinor formalism",
    "s evolution , see @xcite .",
    "there is a direct relation between this construction and ours , which we present in section [ sec : discuss ] . to our knowledge",
    ", the simple spacetime picture presented in this paper is new .",
    "hopefully , it will contribute to the geometric interpretation of the modern spinor and twistor @xcite variables in lqg .",
    "we work with a mostly - plus metric in minkowski space . when considering actions , we work in units where @xmath14 .",
    "consider a set of @xmath15 null vectors @xmath16 in the @xmath11-dimensional minkowski space @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "we assume the following conditions on the null vectors",
    "@xmath16 :    1 .",
    "the @xmath16 span the minkowski space .",
    "this implies in particular that @xmath20 .",
    "the @xmath16 are either all future - pointing or all past - pointing .",
    "the central observation in this paper is that such sets of null vectors are in one - to - one correspondence with convex @xmath9-dimensional spacelike polytopes oriented in @xmath17 .",
    "the proof is straightforward .",
    "first , consider a set @xmath21 as above .",
    "let us take the sum of the @xmath16 , normalized to unit length : @xmath22 the unit vector @xmath23 is timelike , with the same time orientation as the @xmath16 .",
    "we now take @xmath23 to be the unit normal to our spacelike polytope . in other words",
    ", we will construct the polytope in the spacelike hyperplane @xmath24 orthogonal to @xmath23 . to do so",
    ", we define the projections of the null vectors @xmath16 into this hyperplane : @xmath25 the spacelike vectors @xmath26 automatically sum to zero .",
    "also , since the @xmath16 span the spacetime , the @xmath26 must span the hyperplane @xmath24 . by the minkowski reconstruction theorem",
    ", it follows that the @xmath26 are the @xmath10-area normals of a unique convex @xmath9-dimensional polytope in @xmath24 . in this way",
    ", the null vectors @xmath8 define a @xmath9-polytope oriented in spacetime .",
    "conversely , let there be a convex @xmath9-dimensional spacelike polytope oriented in @xmath17 .",
    "let @xmath24 be the polytope s @xmath9-dimensional hyperplane .",
    "let @xmath26 be the area - normal vectors to the polytope s @xmath10-faces within @xmath24 .",
    "finally , let @xmath23 be the ( future - pointing or past - pointing ) timelike unit normal to @xmath24 .",
    "we can then construct the set of null vectors @xmath16 parametrizing the polytope by inverting eq .",
    ": @xmath27",
    "let us now discuss some basic features of the parametrization .",
    "the vectors @xmath16 are associated to the polytope s @xmath10-dimensional faces .",
    "it is clear from the above construction that they are in fact _",
    "null normals _ to these faces .",
    "specifically , a future - pointing ( past - pointing ) vector @xmath16 is the future - outgoing ( past - outgoing ) null normal to the associated face . of course , one could also change signs in the construction , so that the @xmath26 and @xmath16 are ingoing normals . in section [ sec :",
    "simplex ] , both possibilities will be used .",
    "now , the orientation of a spacelike @xmath10-plane in @xmath17 is in one - to - one correspondence with the directions of its two null normals .",
    "thus , each @xmath16 carries _ partial _ information about the orientation of the @xmath2th face .",
    "the second null normal to the face is a function of _ all _ the @xmath16 .",
    "it can be expressed as : @xmath28 where we recall that @xmath23 is given by .",
    "similarly , the area @xmath4 of each face is a function of the null normals @xmath16 to all the faces : @xmath29 finally , the total area of the faces has the simple expression : @xmath30",
    "as a sample application of the null - normal variables , we will now use them to construct a @xmath11-simplex action that reproduces ( in the @xmath13 case ) the large - spin behavior of the barrett - crane spinfoam vertex .    consider a @xmath11-simplex in @xmath17 . let the index @xmath31 run over its @xmath9-dimensional hyperfaces .",
    "these hyperfaces are @xmath9-simplices , which we take to be spacelike .",
    "the @xmath32th @xmath9-simplex shares a common @xmath10-face with every other @xmath9-simplex .",
    "the face shared with the @xmath33th @xmath9-simplex will be denoted as @xmath34 .",
    "we can thus parametrize the @xmath32th @xmath9-simplex with a set of @xmath35 future - pointing null normals @xmath36 , where @xmath37 .",
    "note that the vectors @xmath36 and @xmath38 are null normals to the same face .    at the level of degree - of - freedom counting , the shape of a @xmath11-simplex",
    "is determined by the @xmath39 areas @xmath40 of its @xmath10-faces .",
    "these areas are directly analogous to the spins that appear in the barrett - crane spinfoam .",
    "let us fix a set of values for the @xmath40 and consider the action : @xmath41 here , the @xmath36 are null vectors , with no a - priori relation to the geometry of the @xmath11-simplex ; the relation will emerge dynamically .",
    "the @xmath42 are future - pointing unit timelike vectors .",
    "they will emerge as the unit normals to the @xmath9-simplices , but this is again not fixed a - priori .",
    "finally , the @xmath43 in are lagrange multipliers that fix the products @xmath44 to the corresponding face areas , as in .",
    "one could also introduce lagrange multipliers to enforce the null and unit nature of @xmath36 and @xmath42 , respectively .",
    "instead , we will simply restrict to variations where : @xmath45 in @xmath46 , one could make the @xmath36 automatically null by expressing them as products of spinors . for our purposes",
    ", vector language will suffice .      in @xmath13",
    ", the action has the same stationary points , and takes the same values there , as the effective large - spin action for the barrett - crane vertex . in other dimensions ,",
    "the behavior is completely analogous . in particular , at non - degenerate stationary points , i.e. ones where the @xmath42 span @xmath17 , the 4-simplex geometry is recovered ( up to reflections ) , and the action reduces to the regge action ( up to sign ) .    to show this ,",
    "let us examine the stationary - point equations : @xmath47 in the last two lines , we took into account the constraint on @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",
    "let us examine the different components of eq . .",
    "the projection into the @xmath10-plane orthogonal to @xmath36 and @xmath42 shows that the vectors @xmath36 , @xmath38 and @xmath42 are coplanar .",
    "this leaves the contraction of with @xmath36 , which fixes the value of the lagrange multiplier @xmath43 : @xmath50 where in the last equality we used eq . .",
    "plugging this result into , we find that the unit vector @xmath42 must be the normal to the @xmath9-simplex defined by the @xmath36 s : @xmath51    to sum up , the stationary points of the action have the following properties . for each @xmath32 , the vectors @xmath36 define a @xmath9-simplex with unit normal @xmath42 and @xmath10-face areas @xmath40 .",
    "the @xmath9-simplices automatically agree on the areas of their shared @xmath10-faces .",
    "moreover , we ve seen that @xmath42 is coplanar with @xmath36 and @xmath38 .",
    "since the same conclusion can be reached for @xmath52 , this implies that @xmath53 are all coplanar .",
    "now , in the @xmath32th @xmath9-simplex , the plane orthogonal to the @xmath34 face is spanned by @xmath42 and @xmath36 .",
    "similarly , the plane orthogonal to the @xmath54 face in the @xmath33th @xmath9-simplex is spanned by @xmath52 and @xmath38 .",
    "we conclude that the two @xmath9-simplices agree not only on the area of their shared @xmath10-face , but also on the orientation of its @xmath10-plane in spacetime .",
    "in other words , they agree on the face s area - normal bivector : @xmath55 the relative sign is due to the fact that @xmath36 and @xmath38 point along two _ different _ null directions in the plane orthogonal to the @xmath34 face .",
    "otherwise , the scalar product @xmath56 would vanish , making the action divergent .",
    "the area bivectors defined in automatically satisfy closure ( which follows from ) and cross - simplicity : @xmath57 we conclude that our stationary points are in one - to - one correspondence with the bivector geometries of @xcite ( hodge - dualized and generalized to arbitrary dimension ) , minus the non - degeneracy conditions .",
    "now , to make the connection with the barrett - crane vertex more explicit , let us `` integrate out '' the @xmath43 and @xmath36 , expressing the action in terms of the @xmath42 .",
    "this means imposing eqs . - , but not eq . .",
    "the @xmath43 terms in the action then vanish , leaving us with : @xmath58 each logarithm in is determined up to sign by the @xmath42 .",
    "to see this , consider first the degenerate case @xmath59 , i.e. @xmath60 . then the area - fixing condition and the coplanarity of @xmath61 force @xmath36 and @xmath38 to take the form : @xmath62 for some spacelike unit vector @xmath63 orthogonal to @xmath42 .",
    "this fixes the argument of the logarithm in to : @xmath64 consider now the non - degenerate case , where @xmath42 and @xmath52 are linearly independent .",
    "@xmath36 and @xmath38 are then forced to point in the two null directions within the 1 + 1d plane spanned by @xmath65 .",
    "there is a twofold ambiguity here , since we must choose which of @xmath36 and @xmath38 points along which of the null directions .",
    "once the directions of @xmath36 and @xmath38 are chosen , their extents are determined by the area - fixing condition .",
    "overall , @xmath36 is given by : @xmath66 here , @xmath67 is a sign factor , defined as @xmath68 for `` thick wedges '' ( figure [ fig : orientation](i , iii ) ) and @xmath69 for `` thin wedges '' ( figure [ fig : orientation](ii , iv ) ) . with this definition ,",
    "a minus sign in front of the @xmath67 in yields the configurations in figure [ fig : orientation](i , ii ) , while a plus sign leads to figure [ fig : orientation](iii , iv ) .",
    "this peculiar decomposition of the overall sign will serve to simplify the result below .",
    "the expression for @xmath38 is identical to , with @xmath42 and @xmath52 interchanged .",
    "the argument of the logarithm in then reads :    -face in a @xmath11-simplex , shared by two @xmath9-simplices @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we depict the 1 + 1d plane orthogonal to the face .",
    "the dashed lines are the two null rays in this normal plane . in figures ( i ) and ( iii ) , both @xmath9-simplices are `` final '' , while in ( ii ) and ( iv ) , @xmath32 is initial and @xmath33 is final . in ( i ) and ( ii ) , the timelike @xmath9-simplex normals @xmath65 and the null @xmath10-face normals @xmath70 correspond to a stationary point of the action with @xmath71 .",
    "similarly , figures ( iii ) and ( iv ) depict a configuration with @xmath72.,title=\"fig : \" ] +    @xmath73    for which is a special case .",
    "now , notice that the boost angle @xmath74 between @xmath42 and @xmath52 is given ( up to sign ) by : @xmath75 plugging this into , we get : @xmath76 this brings the action to the form : @xmath77 where the sign can be chosen separately for each face @xmath34 .",
    "is the effective action for the lorentzian barrett - crane 4-simplex , as studied in @xcite .",
    "at the stationary points , there are two consistent sign choices in , . in the first choice ,",
    "we pick the upper signs in , for all the faces , as in figure [ fig : orientation](i - ii ) .",
    "this makes the null normals @xmath36 future - outgoing when the @xmath9-simplex @xmath32 is `` final '' , and future - ingoing when it is `` initial '' . in the second choice",
    ", we pick the lower signs in , for all the faces , as in figure [ fig : orientation](iii - iv ) .",
    "the @xmath36 are then future - ingoing for final @xmath9-simplices and vice versa .",
    "when the stationary point is non - degenerate , i.e. when the @xmath42 span the spacetime , the action reduces to the regge action , up to sign . for the sign choice corresponding to figure [ fig : orientation](i - ii ) , we get @xmath71 . for the sign choice corresponding to figure [ fig : orientation](iii - iv ) , we get @xmath72 .",
    "in this paper , we constructed a parametrization for convex spacelike polyhedra ( or their dimensional generalizations ) oriented in spacetime .",
    "the parametrization uses null face normals , which become spacelike area normals once projected into the hyperplane orthogonal to their sum . as a sample exercise with these variables",
    ", we incorporated them into a gravitational action for a spacetime simplex .",
    "as noted in the introduction , our construction has already appeared in disguise within the lqg literature , in the context of spinor variables .",
    "let us now detail the relation between the two pictures . throughout this paper",
    ", we worked directly in spacetime . in lqg ,",
    "instead one usually starts with boundary states defined in _ space _",
    "( actually , a spacelike hypersurface in time gauge ) .",
    "there , one constructs polyhedra in terms of spatial area - normal vectors @xmath3 , which satisfy the closure constraint . in the spinor approach",
    ", one expresses the @xmath3 as squares @xmath78 of @xmath1 spinors .",
    "now , as discussed in @xcite , if the closure constraint is not satisfied , one can always recover it by performing an @xmath0 transformation on the @xmath79 .",
    "the connection with our picture is as follows .",
    "when the @xmath1 spinors @xmath79 are reinterpreted as @xmath0 spinors , their square @xmath78 acquires a new meaning , as a null vector in spacetime .",
    "these are precisely our null face normals @xmath16 , of which the original @xmath3 are the spatial components !",
    "the failure of the @xmath3 to close simply reflects the fact that the @xmath16 are projected into the wrong hyperplane : instead of the polyhedron s hyperplane as determined by the @xmath16 themselves , they are projected into the arbitrary reference hyperplane which was taken as `` space '' in the lqg construction .",
    "the @xmath0 boost described in @xcite reorients the polyhedron into the reference hyperplane . once this is done , the spatial components of the @xmath16 close .",
    "we conclude with a remark on the time - orientation of the normal vectors in the action . as in the barrett - crane amplitude , we take all the normals to be future - pointing .",
    "this makes their scalar products negative , ensuring that the logarithms in are real .",
    "however , in recent papers @xcite , it has been emphasized by the author that the action of general relativity has an imaginary part .",
    "this imaginary part follows from the @xmath80 contributions to boost angles that arise when one crosses null directions in a timelike plane @xcite . in the present context of a simplex with spacelike faces",
    ", these appear as imaginary parts @xmath81 in the corner angles at `` thin wedges '' ( figure [ fig : orientation](ii , iv ) ) .",
    "the latter can be incorporated into the action by changing the time - orientation of @xmath42 and @xmath36 on initial @xmath9-simplices @xmath32 to past - pointing .",
    "this means taking all the normals to be outgoing with respect to the @xmath11-simplex , rather than taking them all future - pointing .",
    "this is of course the necessary choice for the normal that defines the extrinsic curvature in the york - gibbons - hawking boundary term @xcite for the continuum action . in the action",
    ", it will result in a negative argument in the logarithm for thin wedges , producing an imaginary part @xmath81 in the logarithm s result ( with the added simplification that the @xmath67 sign factors in eq .",
    "become unnecessary ) .",
    "finally , we note that in the eprl / fk spinfoam , the large - spin limit of the 4-simplex amplitude automatically `` knows '' about the action s imaginary part : as shown in @xcite , it can be recovered by sending the immirzi parameter to @xmath82 at the end of the stationary - point calculation .",
