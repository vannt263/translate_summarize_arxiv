    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) and the large - scale structure ( lss ) of galaxies contain a wealth of physical information that can be used to test models of the origin and evolution of the universe .",
    "both are well - described by correlated gaussian random fields , and therefore can be characterised by two - point statistics ( see , e.g. , ) . in particular ,",
    "the angular power spectrum is a natural tool for cmb data analysis , and has also proved useful for the study of the clustering properties of galaxy surveys in redshift bins .",
    "such tomographic approaches will be essential for exploiting next generation surveys such as the dark energy survey ( des ) , which will provide large photometric catalogues where the uncertainties on the redshift estimates complicate a full three - dimensional analysis .",
    "however , data unavoidably contain non - cosmological contributions , for example due to instrumental errors and systematic uncertainties .",
    "these contaminants result in additional correlations in the measured power spectra , and can compromise our interpretation of the observables if not correctly treated . in the context of galaxy surveys , observational systematics and calibration errors can result in extra clustering power over a wide range of scales ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this proves especially problematic at the largest scales , since the corresponding modes need to be constrained from partial sky data .",
    "these modes are nonetheless crucial for testing early universe theories such as cosmological inflation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , the standard paradigm for describing the origin of structure in the universe .",
    "future galaxy surveys will be able to test this paradigm very precisely , particularly through the search for signatures of primordial non - gaussianity ( png ) .",
    "png creates a scale - dependent galaxy bias affecting the 2-point clustering properties of lss tracers at the largest scales @xcite .",
    "hence , these scales , which can be strongly affected by systematics , require particularly careful treatment .",
    "quasars , being highly biased tracers of lss , are excellent candidates to study the scale- and redshift dependence of galaxy bias , for example to constrain png . however , since current spectroscopic samples have low number densities and can not compete with png constraints derived from the cmb , one must resort to photometric quasar catalogues .",
    "the largest catalogues currently available are extracted from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , and were used to study png and the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) @xcite .",
    "however , these studies demonstrated the high sensitivity of the correlation functions to the sky masks under consideration , indicating the presence of significant levels of contamination by stars and calibration - related systematics .",
    "in particular , recent work by @xcite , corroborated by @xcite , confirmed the high levels of contamination in the @xcite catalogue of sdss photometric quasars , leading to concerns about the use of this sample for clustering measurements . in this work ,",
    "we use sample reduction , masking and mode projection to identify a subset of objects in this catalogue that can be used for cosmological analyses .",
    "we concentrate on the main systematics found by previous studies , and analyse their impact on the clustering measurements through auto- and cross - correlation of redshift subsamples with each other , and with templates of the systematics .",
    "note that cross - correlating with external data can also prove useful in identifying and mitigating the systematics in quasar samples .    when analysing photometric catalogues in redshift bins , the theory power spectrum predictions require precise estimates of the redshift distributions , which are compromised by the large uncertainties of the photometric redshifts .",
    "this issue is critical for photometric quasars , since their redshift estimates are significantly more uncertain than for other types of galaxies and include a significant fraction of catastrophic failures .",
    "we investigate the use of spectroscopic catalogues for calculating robust and unbiased redshift distribution estimates for the photometrically - selected quasar subsamples .",
    "in addition to data quality and modelling issues , various methodological issues arise when estimating the power spectrum of a galaxy survey for comparison with theory .",
    "the pseudo - spectrum @xcite and quadratic maximum likelihood @xcite estimators were developed to measure the power spectrum in the presence of sky cuts .",
    "however , numerous technical subtleties and constraints due to pixelisation or limited computer resources are implicit in these estimators , and can create significant biases if not handled carefully , as concluded by several studies on the cmb ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this paper aims to clarify these technicalities in the context of galaxy surveys .",

    "the bias induced by pixelisation as a function of @xmath23 is critical for low - resolution power spectrum estimation , and needs to be corrected .",
    "this issue is investigated in appendix  [ app : bandlimitandsmoothing ] , and the following sections will assume that the relevant corrections have been applied .",
    "due to contamination or inaccessibility of certain regions of the sky , most cosmological applications involve signals that only cover a portion of the sphere .",
    "the power spectrum must then be calculated from a cut - sky map @xmath24 . from a theoretical perspective",

    "the coupling matrix is defined as @xmath42 and is a function of the mask only .",
    "since the variance of each @xmath23-mode depends on number of times it is observed , the minimum variance , namely the cosmic variance presented in eq .",
    "( [ cosmicvar ] ) , is achieved on the full sky only .",
    "partial sky coverage decreases the number of observed modes , and the variance of the pcl estimates in the absence of noise is approximately @xmath43 here , @xmath44 is the fraction of the sky covered by the mask , with @xmath45 corresponding to full sky coverage .",

    "the pcl approach is simply an inversion of the mask and does not attempt to minimise the loss of information caused by the decrease in the number of observed modes .",
    "in fact , it is well known that the pcl estimates are only optimal ( i.e. , unbiased , minimum variance estimates ) for a flat power spectrum ( see e.g. , @xcite and @xcite ) .",

    "the deconvolution and covariance matrices of the estimates are then equal to the inverse of the fisher information matrix . while being no longer theoretically optimal for anisotropic theories , @xcite showed that qml remained superior to pcl .",
    "pcl and qml can be contrasted in terms of the computational complexity and quality of the final power spectrum estimates .",
    "they both depend on the mask , but qml additionally requires an accurate model of the pixel - pixel covariance matrix .",
    "this model requires priors on the fiducial theory @xmath53 and on the additional correlations present in the data , such as noise and systematics .",
    "although the pseudo - spectrum estimator does not explicitly use such priors , it is equivalent to a maximum likelihood analysis when a flat spectrum is assumed in place of a more motivated choice for the pixel - pixel covariance matrix @xcite . as a result , pcl yields nearly optimal estimates when the power spectrum is close to flat and with no anisotropic contributions .",
    "moreover , the sensitivity to the shape of the spectrum decreases at small scales as the number of observed modes increases . a simple inversion of the mask then maximises the likelihood function and the variance of pcl reaches its minimum , namely the inverse of the fisher matrix @xcite , i.e. , @xmath57 note that this result is only valid in the regime where the signal dominates in the covariance matrix .    to illustrate the contrast between the pcl and qml estimates , we calculated and compared their covariance matrices in three realistic settings of interest , involving typical masks and spectra of cmb and galaxy catalogues .",

    "<S> the angular power spectrum is a powerful statistic for analysing cosmological signals imprinted in the clustering of matter . </S>",
    "<S> however , current galaxy and quasar surveys cover limited portions of the sky , and are contaminated by systematics that can mimic cosmological signatures and jeopardise the interpretation of the measured power spectra . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a framework for obtaining unbiased estimates of the angular power spectra of large - scale structure surveys at the largest scales using quadratic estimators . </S>",
    "<S> the method is tested by analysing the 600 cmass mock catalogues constructed by @xcite for the baryon oscillation spectroscopic survey ( boss ) . </S>",
    "<S> we then consider the @xcite catalogue of photometric quasars from the sixth data release ( dr6 ) of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , which is known to include significant stellar contamination and systematic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> focusing on the sample of ultraviolet - excess ( uvx ) sources , we show that the excess clustering power present on the largest - scales can be largely mitigated by making use of improved sky masks and projecting out the modes corresponding to the principal systematics . in particular , we find that the sample of objects with photometric redshift @xmath0 exhibits no evidence of contamination when using our most conservative mask and mode projection . </S>",
    "<S> this indicates that any residual systematics are well within the statistical uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , using our approach , this sample can be used for cosmological studies . </S>"
