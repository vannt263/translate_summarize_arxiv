    "a ( topological ) dynamical system  @xmath0 , where @xmath2 is a compact metric space and @xmath3 is a continuous transformation , gives rise to several `` hyper - systems '' .",
    "for example , @xmath1 acts naturally on @xmath4 , the space of all compact subsets of @xmath2 equipped with the hausdorff metric .",
    "likewise , @xmath1 extends to a continuous ( in the weak - star topology ) operator on the compact space of all ( borel ) probability measures on @xmath2 , by the formula @xmath5 ( see e.g. @xcite ) .    in the same spirit",
    "( although now the domains are not necessarily compact ) , several versions of so - called _ functional envelope _ of a dynamical system have been considered . in",
    "@xcite the authors introduce and study the ( non - compact ) `` hyper - system '' @xmath6 , whose phase space @xmath7 consists of all continuous self - maps of @xmath2 , and the transformation @xmath8 is defined by @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "notice that @xmath7 is a topological  semigroup with respect to the uniform topology and @xmath11 is uniformly continuous ( because @xmath1 is uniformly continuous ) .",
    "since @xmath2 is compact , the uniform metric agrees with the compact - open topology and it is also equivalent to the hausdorff metric applied to the graphs of functions @xmath12 ( which are closed in @xmath13 ) .",
    "however , these two metrics are in general not uniformly equivalent , therefore the two versions ,  uniform \" and  hausdorff \" , of the functional envelope ( both addressed in @xcite ) may differ in some dynamical properties which depend on the metric ( for example the topological  entropy in non - compact systems does ) .. ] in the present paper we focus exclusively on the uniform metric , nonetheless some of our results extend without much effort to the hausdorff metric as well . also note that the action of @xmath11 is by the composition with @xmath1 on the left .",
    "the action by the composition on the right is always a contraction ( by which , throughout this note , we understand that it does not increase the distance ) in the uniform metric on @xmath7 ( it is an isometry if @xmath1 is surjective ) , so it is not very interesting in the studies of entropy .",
    "now suppose additionally that the map @xmath1 is a homeomorphism . then the space @xmath14 of all self - homeomorphisms of @xmath2 is invariant under @xmath11 and @xmath15 becomes another kind of functional envelope (",
    "also addressed in @xcite ) .",
    "now @xmath14 is a topological group , in general not compact and not even complete in the uniform metric .",
    "it is thus customary to consider this group with the equivalent , but complete , symmetric metric obtained as the sum of the uniform distance and the uniform distance between inverses .",
    "however , the second part of this metric is easily seen to be invariant under @xmath11 .",
    "thus , despite the fact that it makes the action of @xmath11 distal , it does not contribute to entropy ( which is our main subject of interest ) , therefore , from our point of view it is sufficient to equip @xmath14 with the uniform distance ( the lack of completeness will not bother us at all ) .",
    "it is known that the topological  entropy of the `` hyper - system '' induced on probability measures behaves quite radically :",
    "it equals zero if and only if @xmath16 , otherwise it is infinite ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . for the hyper - system on @xmath4 the situation is different : if @xmath1 has positive entropy then the hyper - system has infinite entropy , otherwise the hyper - system may have zero , finite positive or infinite entropy ( see @xcite ) . in this paper",
    "we will be interested in the _ topological _ entropy of the functional envelopes .",
    "since no other entropy will be addressed , in what follows we will skip the adjective `` topological '' . likewise , all topological  spaces in this note are _ metric _ , hence also this adjective will be skipped .",
    "let us gather some basic known facts and open problems concerning the entropy of the functional envelopes :    1 .",
    "the entropy of @xmath6 is always not smaller than that of @xmath0 ; to see this it suffices to consider the subsemigroup of constant self - maps , which is conjugate to @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   on the other hand",
    ", it is not known whether the same inequality holds for @xmath17 , see  @xcite .",
    "there are examples of zero entropy continuous maps on countable spaces and on the interval , for which @xmath6 has infinite entropy @xcite .",
    "4 .   on the other hand ,",
    "analogous examples for @xmath15 are missing .",
    "s. kolyada and j. semikina @xcite conjecture that the functional envelope @xmath6 has entropy either zero or infinity . at present",
    "it is known that the conjecture holds true for all peano continua and for all compact spaces with continuum many connected components @xcite .",
    "otherwise the conjecture remains open .",
    "the same problem can be posed for the functional envelope @xmath17 in case @xmath1 is a homeomorphism .    in this paper",
    "we resolve some questions of this type :    1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is a self - homeomorphism of a compact zero - dimensional space @xmath2 then both functional envelopes @xmath18 and @xmath17 have infinite entropy except when @xmath1 is equicontinuous , in which case both entropies are equal to zero , see theorem  [ t : zerodim ] .",
    "this answers positively the question ( 2 ) and the kolyada ",
    "semikina conjecture ( 5 ) ( also the version for @xmath17 ) for homeomorphisms on compact zero - dimensional spaces .",
    "2 .   as an immediate consequence",
    "we get that there exist zero entropy homeomorphisms such that @xmath17 has infinite entropy , providing examples called for in ( 4 ) .",
    "we also give a simple direct example , see the end of section  [ s : zero - dim case ] .",
    "there exists a positive ( even infinite ) entropy homeomorphism @xmath1 of a compact space @xmath2 such that @xmath17 has entropy zero , see corollary  [ c : tpositive ft zero ] .",
    "this proves that the general question ( 2 ) has a negative answer .",
    "the item ( c ) above is solved using a new class of spaces , which we call _ _ slovak spaces _ _ , defined by the combination of two properties : the existence of a minimal homeomorphism , say @xmath1 , and nonexistence of homeomorphisms other than the powers of  @xmath1 . for such spaces",
    "we prove that the functional envelope @xmath15 always has entropy zero .",
    "of course , it is completely unclear that such spaces exist , not to mention that we would like the system @xmath0  to have positive ( or even infinite ) entropy .",
    "thus , large part of the paper is devoted to delivering appropriate examples , see section  [ s : slovak ] .    as a byproduct , nonetheless an interesting and important outcome of our work",
    ", we prove that among slovak spaces we find long searched for examples of non - degenerate continua of type ( 1,0 ) ( admitting a minimal homeomorphism but not a minimal non - invertible map ) other than the circle ( see @xcite for the formulation of the problem ) .",

    "a decomposable continuum has either just one composant @xmath2 or three composants : @xmath2 and two proper composants that cover @xmath2 .",
    "if @xmath2 is a non - degenerate indecomposable continuum then its composants are pairwise disjoint , hence form a partition of @xmath2 into sets of first category , and thus there are uncountably many of them .",
    "we make an additional observation ( which is not included in @xcite ) :    [ compan ] if @xmath23 is a continuous map between continua and @xmath24 has more than one composant , then each composant @xmath25 of @xmath2 is mapped either into a proper composant of @xmath24 or onto @xmath24 .    by ( c2 ) , if @xmath26 is not contained in a proper composant then it contains an irreducible pair .",

    "* proposition 1 ) : the continuum @xmath2 is formed by two concentric circles connected by a spiral ( which is a continuous injective image of the real line ) , whose one  tail \" wraps around the smaller circle from outside and the other  tail \" approaches the larger circle from inside .",
    "this continuum has three composants ( the complements of each circle and @xmath2 ) .",
