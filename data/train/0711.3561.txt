    "particle physicists worldwide are working on the design of a high energy collider of electrons and positrons ( the international linear collider or ilc ) which could be operational sometime around 2019 .",
    "any experiment exploiting the ilc will require a high performance vertex detector to detect and measure short - lived particles , yet be tolerant to radiation damage for its anticipated lifetime .",
    "one candidate is a set of concentric cylinders of charge - coupled devices ( ccds ) , read out at a frequency of around 50mhz .",
    "it is known that ccds suffer from both surface and bulk radiation damage . however ,",
    "when considering charge transfer losses in buried channel devices only bulk traps are important .",
    "these defects create energy levels ( traps ) between the conduction and valence band , and electrons are captured by them .",
    "these electrons are also emitted back to the conduction band after a certain time .",
    "it is usual to define the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) as the fractional loss of charge after transfer across one pixel .",
    "an initial charge @xmath0 after being transported across @xmath1 pixels is reduced to @xmath2 . for ccd devices containing many pixels , cti values around 10@xmath3",
    "are important .",
    "previous results for a ccd with sequential readout have recently been reported  @xcite .",
    "the expected background rate at the future ilc near the interaction point leads to radiation damage in the ccd detector .",
    "we simulated the charge transfer in a cpccd ( column - parallel ccd ) using the trap concentrations listed in fig .",

    "it is a two - phase buried - channel ccd with 20@xmath8 m square pixels .",
    "simulations of a simplified model of this device have been performed with the ise - tcad package ( version 7.5 ) , particularly the dessis program ( device simulation for smart integrated systems ) .",
    "the simulation is essentially two dimensional and assumes a 1@xmath8 m device thickness ( width ) for calculating densities .",
    "the overall length and depth are 55@xmath8 m and 20@xmath8 m respectively ( fig .",
    "[ fig : trap ] ) .",
    "parameters of interest are the readout frequency , up to 50mhz , and the operating temperature between 130k and 300k although simulations have been performed up to 440k .",

    "after dessis has simulated the transfer process , a 2d integration of the trapped charge density distribution is performed independently to give the total charge under each gate .",
    "this cti study , at nominal clock voltage , focuses only on the bulk traps with energies 0.17ev and 0.44ev below the bottom of the conduction band .",
    "these will be referred to simply as the 0.17ev and 0.44ev traps .",
    "the 0.17  ev trap is an oxygen - vacancy defect , referred to as an a - centre defect .",
    "the 0.44  ev trap is a phosphorus - vacancy defect , an e - centre defect , as a result of the silicon being doped with phosphorus and a vacancy manifesting from the displacement of a silicon atom bonded with a phosphorus atom  @xcite .",
    "the cti dependence on temperature and readout frequency was explored and figure  [ fig : allfreq_0_17ev ] shows the cti for simulations with partially filled 0.17ev and 0.44ev traps at different frequencies for temperatures between 130k and 440k , with a nominal clock voltage of 3v .",

    "the motivation for introducing an analytic model is to understand the underlying physics through making comparisons with the tcad simulations .",
