    "for several decades , computer simulations , theoretical models , and polarization experiments have been shaping and deepening our understanding of how molecules reorient in liquids and solutions .",
    "most of these studies deal with equilibrium molecular ensembles .",
    "much less is known about molecular reorientation under non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "the study of photodissociation in a condensed phase offers such a possibility .",
    "indeed , the incipient photofragments are highly non - equilibrium , and their rotational excitation is determined by the excited state potential energy surface of the parent molecule .",
    "traditionally , polarization photodissociation experiments ( both in the steady state and in the time domain ) have been performed in the gas phase under collision - free conditions .",
    "@xcite recently , a number of  \" real time  \" measurements @xcite and computer simulations @xcite has been reported , where the anisotropy decay of diatomic photoproducts was studied in the condensed phase .",
    "both classical @xcite and quantum @xcite models of the anisotropy decay in the dissipative ensemble of photofragments have also been developed .",
    "so far , theoretical efforts have primarily been focused on studying experimental observables , i.e. polarization time - dependent transients ( anisotropies ) . very recently",
    ", an account of combined theoretical and experimental study of rotational and orientational relaxation of linear cn photofragments under highly non - equilibrium conditions has been published .",
    "@xcite the authors report a number of extremely interesting and sometimes unexpected phenomena , which are quite difficult to comprehend within the existing theoretical paradigms .",
    "the authors demonstrate , in particularly , that relaxation of the rotational energy of hot non - equlibrium photofragments ( i ) slows down significantly with the increase of their initial rotational temperature and ( ii ) differs dramatically from the relaxation of the equilibrium rotational energy correlation function , manifesting thereby breakdown of the linear response description .",
    "what are the physical origins of the long rotational relaxation times and the linear response failure ?",
    "these are the questions which interest us here .",
    "we suggest that the angular momentum dependence of the rotational friction is responsible for the observed behaviour .",
    "we offer an explanation why this effect does not manifest itself under equilibrium conditions , while it becomes pivotal far from equilibrium .",
    "the structure of our paper is the following .",
    "the analysis of the problem of rotational relaxation within the exact generalized master equations , as well as the formal solution of these equations in terms of eigenfunctions is presented in sec .",
    "the generalized fokker - planck equation ( fpe ) with the angular momentum dependent friction is developed in sec .",
    "3 . in this section",
    ", the fpe with algebraic friction is solved for various rotational correlation functions ( cfs ) , which are compared with the cfs simulated in ref .",
    "@xcite our main findings are summarized in the conclusion .",
    "note that the reduced variables are used throughout the article : time , angular momentum and energy are measured in units of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "here @xmath3 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath4 is the temperature of the equilibrium bath molecules , and @xmath5 is the moment of inertia of the photofragment , so that @xmath6 is the averaged period of its free rotation . for cn at @xmath7k , @xmath8@xmath9ps .",
    "let us consider an ensemble of photofragments coupled to a heat bath .",
    "we assume that the photofragments interact with the bath molecules , but do not interact with each other .",
    "we suppose that at the time moment @xmath10 the joint probability density in the photofragment + bath phase space can be written as a product of the equilibrium distribution for the bath molecules and a certain non - equilibrium distribution @xmath11 for the photofragments .",
    "@xcite restricting our consideration to linear / spherical photofragments , we can apply the projection operator technique to the many body liouville equation and derive the exact rotational master equation for photofragments @xcite    @xmath12    here @xmath13 is the probability density function , @xmath14 is the angular momentum of the photofragment in its molecular frame , @xmath15 are the euler angles which specify orientation of the molecular frame with respect to the laboratory one .",
    "the free - rotor liouville operator describes the angular momentum driven reorientation,@xmath16 @xmath17 being the angular momentum operator in the molecular frame .",
    "the relaxation operator obeys normalization    @xmath18    which insures the conservation of probability ( @xmath19 ) and the detailed balance @xmath20 which is responsible for bringing the system under study to the equilibrium rotational boltzmann distribution@xmath21 here @xmath22 for linear rotors and @xmath23 for spherical tops . since molecules are massive inertial particles , the relaxation operator @xmath24 can depend upon @xmath17 , @xmath14 , and @xmath25 , but ( in the absence of external fields ) is @xmath15-independent .",
    "this later requirement is a direct consequence of isotropy of the rotational phase space .",
    "it is important for the further consideration that @xmath24 , by its construction , is independent of the initial condition @xmath26 . to put it differently : once @xmath24 is chosen , it should describe the time evolution of the probability density function @xmath13 for any initial condition .",
    "we shall further limit ourselves to the long - time ( markovian ) evolution of the probability density , i.e. assume that the timescale of interest is much longer than the characteristic time of bath - induced fluctuations .",
    "thus , the master equation ( [ kin1 ] ) transforms into @xmath27 here @xmath28 in addition , we concentrate on the evolution of the quantities which depend on the angular momentum @xmath14 but are independent of the euler angles @xmath15 .",
    "then , keeping in mind that @xmath29 is independent of @xmath15 , we can integrate eq .",
    "( [ kin2 ] ) over @xmath15 and arrive at the reduced master equation    @xmath30    here @xmath29 can depend upon @xmath14 and @xmath25 .    due to the fact that the relaxation operator ( [ c ] ) obeys the detailed balance ( [ detbal ] ) , it is hermitian",
    ". let us denote its eigenfunctions and eigenvalues by @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the eigenfunctions are assumed to be orthonormal , @xmath34 .",
    "@xmath29 possesses a single eigenfunction @xmath35 , @xmath36 , with the eigenvalue @xmath37 ( this is another way of saying that the boltzmann distribution is the right - hand eigenfunction of @xmath29 with zero eigenvalue ) and all its other eigenfunctions @xmath31 have positive eigenvalues @xmath32 ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "if the eigenfunctions are known , we can evaluate any cf of interest .",
    "let us assume that , initially , the photofragments had a certain non - equilibrium distribution , @xmath11 .",
    "then the angular momentum cf @xmath39 , the averaged rotational energy @xmath40 , and the rotational energy cf @xmath41 , are determined as follows : @xmath42    @xmath43    @xmath44    we use the notation @xmath45 , @xmath46 .    the j - diffusion model @xcite and the standard rotational fpe @xcite predict the cfs @xmath40 and @xmath41 to be identical and single - exponential , even in the case of arbitrary initial non - equilibrium distribution @xmath11 .",
    "the same does the keilson - storer model @xcite , which contains the j - diffusion and the fpe models as a special case . on the other hand",
    ", the simulations carried out in @xcite demonstrate that ( i ) the averaged rotational energy @xmath40 slows down significantly with the increase of the rotational temperature of the photofragments and ( ii ) @xmath40 for hot non - equlibrium photofragments differs dramatically from the equilibrium rotational energy cf @xmath41 , manifesting thereby breakdown of the linear response description .",
    "( [ cj])-([cbe ] ) offer a clear explanation of the failure of the standard models of rotational relaxation to describe the above phenomena . within the j - diffusion model @xcite , the ( standard ) rotational fpe @xcite and the keilson - storer model @xcite , the angular momentum cf @xmath39",
    "is described by a single eigenfunction @xmath47 ; @xmath40 and @xmath41 are also described by a single , but different , eigenfunction , @xmath48 .",
    "@xcite thus , irrespective of the initial condition @xmath11 , the rate of decay of these cfs is the same .",
    "if the eigenfunctions which contribute significantly into the coefficients @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath52 in eqs . ( [ cj])-([cbe ] ) differ from each other , then the behavior of @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 under equilibrium and non - equilibrium conditions can be very different .",
    "this is an indication that the standard rotational models must be generalized , allowing for the rate of rotational relaxation to be angular momentum dependent .",
    "this requirement is easy to understand by using both classical and quantum arguments .",
    "indeed , let @xmath53 be a characteristic collision time .",
    "such a collision can induce transition between the rotational quantum states @xmath54 and @xmath55 with the frequency @xmath56 provided that @xcite @xmath57 the massey parameter ( [ mas ] ) tells us that the molecules possessing relatively small angular momentum experience rotationally inelastic collisions , while those possessing high enough angular momentum experience @xmath54-conserving collisions .",
    "this means that the collision rates must be @xmath54-dependent , and this is explicitly assumed in various `` fitting laws '' , which are available in the literature for describing @xmath54-resolved cross - sections .",
    "@xcite if we are interested in cfs , which are averaged over @xmath54 , then , under equilibrium conditions , the majority of rotational states with non - negligible boltzmann factors are involved in inelastic collisions . clearly , if the rotationally hot photofragments are produced via dissociation , then the contribution due to @xmath54-conserving collisions will increase and must be properly accounted for .",
    "if the classical picture is adopted , we can simply state that the higher is the angular momentum , the more collisions are necessary to randomize it .",
    "for example , the rate of the angular momentum change in a binary collision collision is clearly @xmath58-dependent . @xcite it is therefore not surprising that gordon in his classical paper @xcite on rotational relaxation suggested modifications of his m - diffusion model toward @xmath58-dependent collision frequency .",
    "this idea has further been elaborated in papers .",
    "@xcite however , the effects due to the @xmath58-dependent collision rates did not receive much attention in the theory of rotational and orientational relaxation , which deals primarily with ensemble - averaged rotational and orientational cfs .",
    "indeed , if we wish to describe these cfs under equilibrium conditions , then ( putting aside non - markovian effects ) we can always introduce certain effective ( averaged over @xmath58 ) collision frequencies or relaxation rates .",
    "if we describe rotational relaxation in a wide range of non - equilibrium initial conditions , these effective collision frequencies and rates are no longer applicable , and their explicit dependence on the angular momentum must be taken into consideration .",
    "on the basis of detailed simulations , the authors of paper@xcite have proposed the following physical interpretation of the slowing down of rotational relaxation of hot photofargments : highly rotationally energetic cn molecules push one ( or several ) argon atoms out of the solvation shell and , after that , rotate more or less freely before the restructuring of the shell occurs .",
    "this microscopic scenario corroborates entirely with our approach .",
    "this is just another way of saying that highly rotationally excited molecules experience lower friction than their less energetic counterparts .    for the purposes of the description of cfs ( [ cj])-([cbe ] ) under non - equilibrium conditions we can not , unfortunately , use the m - diffusion model with @xmath58-dependent collision frequency @xcite and related approaches @xcite , since all these models assume @xmath58-conserving ( adiabatic ) relaxation mechanisms .",
    "neither can we straightforwardly generalize the j - diffusion or the keilson - storer model by introducing the @xmath58-dependent collision frequency , since this procedure would violate normalization ( and therefore conservation ) of the probability density ( eq .",
    "( [ norm ] ) ) .",
    "the next section is aimed at developing the proper description .",
    "without any loss of generality , the relaxation operator ( [ c ] ) can be cast into the form of the generalized fpe operator :    @xmath59    here the generalized friction @xmath60 is , in general , an operator which depends upon @xmath14 and @xmath25.@xcite if the friction is constant ( @xmath61 ) then the standard rotational fpe is recovered , which yields the single - exponential cfs @xcite",
    "@xmath62    the concept of friction is fundamental for understanding the rotational dynamics in solutions.@xcite in the literature , a distinction has normally been made between the `` dielectric '' friction ( which accounts for long - ranged interaction of polar solute molecules with a polar solvent ) and `` mechanical '' friction ( which is responsible for short - range anisotropic interactions ) .",
    "since argon has been used as a solvent in the simulations carried out in @xcite , we further focus on the `` mechanical '' friction .",
    "as has been explained in the previous section , the drawback off all standard models of rotational relaxation is the following : the relaxation rates are angular momentum independent . to circumvent this problem",
    ", we employ the fpe ( [ liho ] ) with the angular momentum dependent friction ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) and choose    @xmath63    here the parameters @xmath64 are real , and @xmath65 is an integer.@xcite such a functional form of the friction complies with qualitative considerations presented in sec .",
    "ii . furthermore , the same expression has been suggested by gordon @xcite as an extension of his m - diffusion model and similar formulas are used for describing rotational friction of `` active '' brownian particles , which convert the energy of the environment into the kinetic energy of their motion.@xcite it is necessary to emphasize that the parameters @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath65 , by their construction , must be independent of the initial conditions .",
    "this means that if eqs .",
    "( [ liho ] ) and ( [ ksv ] ) describe rotational relaxation correctly , then they must describe cfs in a wide range of initial conditions with fixed @xmath66 , @xmath67 , and @xmath65 .    for simplicity , we shall further restrict ourselves to the one - dimensional case .",
    "that is , we assume that @xmath14 is one - dimensional vector ( hereafter , the vector notation is therefore abandoned ) , and the equilibrium boltzmann distribution is given by eq .",
    "( [ boltz ] ) with @xmath68 .",
    "furthermore , we assume that the non - equilibrium distribution can also be written as a boltzmann distribution , but at a different temperature @xmath69:@xcite @xmath70    we have used maple 9.5 to numerically solve the fpe ( [ liho ] ) with friction ( [ ksv ] ) and calculate @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 . the results of the calculations are depicted in fig .",
    "1 . as expected , the decay times of all the cfs increase when we approach non - equilibrium conditions ( hot photofragments ) .",
    "all the non - equilibrium cfs @xmath39 , @xmath40 , and @xmath41 differ considerably from each other as well as from their equilibrium counterparts ( [ all ] ) .",
    "as is clearly seen , @xmath40 calculated for hot photofragments deviates significantly from the equilibrium rotational energy cf @xmath41 ( compare the upper dashed line with the lower dotted line ) .",
    "this is in the agreement with the results of papers , @xcite which demonstrate inadequacy of the linear response theory in reproducing @xmath40 far from equilibrium .    in order to get more insight into the behavior of cfs ,",
    "it is helpful to consider their integral correlation times    @xmath71    now one more argument in favor of choosing algebraic friction ( [ ksv ] ) is coming : as is shown in the appendix , we can calculate eqs .",
    "( [ tau ] ) analytically .",
    "the results read :    @xmath72    @xmath73    @xmath74    if @xmath75 , then we recover the standard fpe formulas .",
    "the presence of @xmath76 causes the increase of the relaxation times .",
    "( [ tauj])-([taue ] ) help us to reveal an important fact . let us assume that the @xmath58-dependence of friction ( [ ksv ] ) is weak , that is @xmath77 .",
    "if the initial conditions are close to equilibrium ( @xmath78 ) , then the contribution due to the @xmath58-dependent friction in eqs .",
    "( [ tauj])-([taue ] ) is proportional to @xmath67 and is therefore small .",
    "this observation supports the use of the models with constant relaxation rates ( the j - diffusion model , @xcite the standard rotational fpe , @xcite and the keilson - storer model @xcite ) for the description of molecular reorientation under equilibrium conditions .",
    "suppose that the initial conditions are highly non - equilibrium , so that the characteristic temperature of the photofragments is much higher than the bath temperature , @xmath79 . then the contribution of the second term in eqs .",
    "( [ tauj])-([taue ] ) is determined by the factor of @xmath80 , which is no longer small even if @xmath77.@xcite thus @xmath81{b } \\label{thresh}\\ ] ] delivers the threshold value of the non - equilibrium temperature ( or rotational energy ) , for which the slowing down of rotational relaxation becomes significant .",
    "the existence of such a threshold temperature is clearly demonstrated in ref.@xcite the farther we are from equilibrium ( the higher is @xmath82 ) , the stronger is the effect due to the @xmath58-dependence of friction .",
    "this finding corroborates a general paradigm of statistical physics and non - equilibrium thermodynamics , which emphasizes the growing role of fluctuations far from equilibrium .",
    "the above considerations explain why the linear - response theory , which identifies the non - equilibrium averaged rotational energy @xmath40 with equilibrium rotational energy fluctuations @xmath41 , breaks down far from equilibrium .",
    "if we are close to equilibrium , then the contribution of the high-@xmath58 states into rotational relaxation is minor .",
    "thus the equilibrium fluctuations sample adequately the angular momentum exchange between the solute and solvent molecules .",
    "if we move far from equilibrium , then rotational relaxation spreads over the high-@xmath58 states , and equilibrium fluctuations are unable to adequately sample the angular momentum exchange .    once eqs .",
    "( [ tauj])-([taue ] ) are available , we can attempt to make more quantitative comparison of the present theory with the results of simulations reported in .",
    "@xcite if our approach grasps essential physics of the phenomenon , we shall be able to fit all the simulated @xmath40 by a single set of the parameters @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we have thus proceeded as follows .",
    "we have numerically calculated the integral relaxation times of @xmath40 simulated at different @xmath69 . by combining the obtained dimensionless values of @xmath83 at equilibrium ( @xmath84k ) and at a certain temperature @xmath85 we have used eq .",
    "( [ taus ] ) to calculate the corresponding parameters @xmath66 and @xmath67 for @xmath86 .",
    "the results of these calculations are summed up in table 1 .",
    "if our approach is self - consistent , the values of @xmath66 and @xmath67 must be more or less the same for any @xmath69 . as is seen from the table ,",
    "this is certainly not the case for @xmath87 , while the calculations with @xmath88 exhibit a remarkable consistency .",
    "thus we can speculate that the fpe ( [ liho ] ) with friction ( [ ksv ] ) at @xmath88 describes the simulated @xmath40 rather adequately .",
    "the so calculated @xmath40 , along with their simulated counterparts @xcite are depicted in fig .",
    "2 . the overall",
    "agreement is satisfactory , but not perfect .",
    "there exists a number of reasons for such a deviation .",
    "first , the simulated cfs clearly exhibit short - time non - markovian behavior . in order to describe this",
    ", the present fpe should be generalized to account for memory effects ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "such a generalization is necessary , for example , for reproducing the short - time ( @xmath89fs ) coincidence of the simulated @xmath40 at different @xmath69.@xcite second , in order to calculate the integral relaxation times ( [ tauj])-([taue ] ) analytically , we have switched to the one - dimensional model , while the actual description for linear photofragments must be two - dimensional .",
    "third , as is well known , the fpe itself may not be very good for reproducing rotational relaxation in liquids @xcite , so that more refine approaches might be necessary .",
    "the present paper undertakes the first step toward understanding non - equilibrium rotational relaxation .",
    "the message is as follows : the friction , or the collision frequency , or the relaxation rate must be taken @xmath58-dependent in order to adequately describe rotational relaxation under highly non - equilibrium conditions .",
    "recently , the groups of bradforth and stratt have published the results of the combined theoretical and experimental study of rotational relaxation of cn - photofragments in a condensed phase . @xcite",
    "they show via molecular dynamics simulations that the time evolution of the averaged rotational energy , @xmath40 , ( i ) slows down dramatically with the increase of the rotational temperature of the incipient photofragments and ( ii ) deviates significantly from the equilibrium rotational energy cf , @xmath41 , manifesting the linear response breakdown . to comprehend and explain this unusual behavior , we have developed a theory of rotational relaxation under non - equilibrium conditions , by extending the standard fpe approach to account for angular momentum dependent friction .",
    "we have calculated the angular momentum cf @xmath39 , as well as @xmath40 and @xmath41 , and compared them with their simulated counterparts .",
    "@xcite we have shown that @xmath58-dependence of rotational friction is responsible for the observed slowing down of rotational relaxation and failure of the linear response description , provided the effective non - equilibrium rotational temperature exceeds the threshold value ( [ thresh ] ) .",
    "the farther the system is from the equilibrium , the stronger is the effect .",
    "we are grateful to guohua tao and richard m. stratt for providing us with the numerical data on the calculated cfs and measured anisotropies which have been published in@xcite , for sending us a manuscript of paper@xcite prior to publication , and for helpful discussions .",
    "this work was partially supported by the american chemical society petroleum research fund ( 44481-g6 ) and general research board summer award from the university of maryland .",
    "we start from the one - dimensional fpe with the angular momentum dependent friction @xmath90,@xmath91 evidently , a cf of the functions @xmath92 and @xmath93 can be evaluated via eq .",
    "( [ fpe1 ] ) as follows : @xmath94 ( the notation is identical to that used in eqs .",
