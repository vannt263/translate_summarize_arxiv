    "the inner few degrees of the galactic center show a large concentration of molecular , atomic hydrogen and dust clouds ( pierce - price et al . 2000 ; lang et al . 2010 ; molinari et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the molecular gas toward the galactic center is considered to reside in the so - called central molecular zone ( cmz ) and consists of a mixture of diffuse and dense components ( morris and serabyn 1996 ; martin et al . 2004 ; sawada et al . 2004",
    "; oka et al . 2005 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "radio continuum emission from this region is also extended and is produced by a mixture of thermal and nonthermal processes ( nord et al .",
    "2004 ; yusef - zadeh et al . 2004 ; law et al .",
    "2008 ) . given the confusing region of the inner galaxy due to large number of foreground and background sources along the line of sight as well as the complex motion of the gas in the galactic center , it is difficult to use the kinematic distance method to identify molecular clouds associated with hii regions and supernova remnants .",
    "we describe a new technique to identify neutral clouds that show a deficiency in the distribution of radio continuum emission .",
    "these clouds are embedded in a bath of radiation or cosmic ray particles produced by thermal or nonthermal sources , respectively .",
    "the strong radiation field in the environment of cloud complexes with high column densities , such as infrared dark clouds ( irdcs ) , allow us to identify their dark counterparts in radio continuum images at cm and mm wavelengths .",
    "the origin of radio dark clouds ( rdcs ) is unlike the x - ray shadowing and irdcs which are caused by strong absorption of background light by dense clouds ( egan et al .",
    "1998 ; andersen et al .",
    "rdcs are also unlike optically thick hii regions seen in absorption against the strong background nonthermal emission at low frequencies .",
    "this effect is due to a free - free absorption coefficient which increases at low frequencies as @xmath2 ( nord et al .",
    "the origin of the deficiency in radio continuum emission at high frequencies is due to the high column of embedded molecular gas that does not allow an external radiation field or cosmic ray particles to penetrate through the cloud .",
    "this implies that this subset of molecular clouds is interacting with its surrounding hot medium .",
    "we first demonstrate the physical situation in which radio dark clouds are produced followed by five examples demonstrating the reality of radio dark clouds .",
    "since background radio continuum radiation is transparent when passing through neutral clouds , one would expect uniform background emission across the face of neutral clouds .",
    "however , if a cloud is surrounded by hot synchrotron or thermal emitting plasma , the continuum emission is depressed due to the shorter path length of the continuum emission integrated along the line of sight toward the center of the molecular cloud .",
    "one possibility involves external heating and ionization of neutral gas by ultraviolet continuum radiation that falls off rapidly from the edge to the center of the cloud with where the visual extinction ( a@xmath3 ) is much larger than one magnitude .",
    "thus , free - free radio emission is substantially reduced in clouds with high column densities and their imprint can be identified as dark features in radio continuum images . in other words , atomic or molecular gas clouds or dust clouds suppress the continuum emission and create the appearance of a `` hole '' in their distribution .",
    "it is expected that neutral clouds embedded in a hot plasma are edge brightened outlining the boundary of the cloud , thus can be distinguished from a cavity devoid of gas .",
    "the presence of spectral line and/or continuum dust emission can also distinguish rdcs .",
    "we consider a cloud with a diameter @xmath4 located at a distance d from us and is embedded within an ionized medium characterized to have electron density @xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) and with the emission measure @xmath7 @xmath8 along a path length @xmath9 .",
    "the surface brightness toward the center and away from the cloud are defined as s@xmath10 and s@xmath11 , respectively , at a given frequency @xmath12 .",
    "the flux deficiency @xmath13 is the difference between the flux density of the ambient gas toward and away from the cloud .",
    "the ratio of the diameter of the cloud to the path length @xmath9 is    @xmath14    the differential emission measure @xmath15em between the cloud center and the ionized medium can be estimated by    @xmath16    where t@xmath17 is the electron temperature in k , @xmath18 is the beam size in arcsecond and @xmath19 is the flux deficiency in mjy .",
    "if the electron density of the ionized medium is measured independently , then the depth of the molecular cloud @xmath4 along the line of sight can be estimated .",
    "another possibility that could produce rdcs is the deflection of non - thermal particles as they diffuse inside a molecular cloud . in this case , the path length over which nonthermal particles travel are limited by the magnetic field geometry of the cloud which could shield the electrons penetrating into the cloud .",
    "the ionization losses of nonthermal particles could also suppress the emission from high energy particles as they interact with the gas .",
    "thus , the flux of nonthermal emission at high frequencies is expected to be reduced with respect to the background nonthermal emission .",
    "if we assume that the magnetic field is in equipartition with the particles , the ratio of the magnetic field in the diffuse medium to the molecular cloud is    @xmath20    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the magnetic fields in the ambient medium and dense cloud , respectively .",
    "the spectral index of the emission @xmath23 , where s@xmath24 , is assumed to be constant .",
    "multi - wavelength images presented here are based on observations that have already been described elsewhere .",
    "the data that we have used are taken by mopra telescope ( jones et al .",

    "this cloud is part of a layer of molecular gas associated with the central molecular zone .",
    "this elongated cloud is detected at mid - ir and submm images as an irdc ( molinari et al .",

    "the deficiency in the flux density of radio continuum emission is @xmath260.1 jy implying that the depth of the ionized gas and molecular gas is similar to each other .",
    "these images demonstrate a clear anti - correlation in the distribution of molecular gas that is detected as an irdc and radio dark cloud .",
    "the cross cuts combined with images of this cloud at radio and millimeter wavelengths suggest that the ionized and molecular gas in g359.750.13 are in the same environment , most likely in the galactic center region .",
    "this is because diffuse radio continuum emission from the galactic center is much stronger than in the galactic disk .",
    "* g0.13 - 0.13 and the radio arc : * adjacent to the nonthermal filaments of the arc near galactic longitude @xmath27 lies the molecular cloud g0.13 - 0.13 we compare the distribution of radio continuum and molecular line emission from g0.13 - 0.13 .",

    "1987 ) and to the west of g0.13 - 0.13 ( reich 2003 ) .",
    "the images and cross cuts made from hcn line and radio continuum data show anti - correlation between molecular line and radio continuum distributions .",
    "the largest deficiency of radio continuum emission is located where molecular line emission peaks .",
    "these intensity profiles imply the interaction of nonthermal radio filaments and g0.13 - 0.13 and are consistent with earlier studies measurements ( tsuboi et al . 1997 ) .",
    "the flux of the continuum emission at 3.5 cm is reduced by a factor 2 where the molecular cloud g0.13 - 0.13 is located .",
    "this implies that the region of nonthermal emission surrounding rdc is twice the depth of the molecular cloud .",
    "* g359.160.04 and the snake filament : * one of the most prominent nonthermal filamentary structure in the galactic center region is the snake filament which extends for more than 20@xmath29 and runs almost perpendicular to the galactic plane ( e.g. , gray et al .",
    "figure 3a shows the northern half of this striking filament terminating at the radio continuum source g359.16 - 0.04 ( uchida et al .",

    "contours of integrated emission of co ( 4 - 3 ) line are superimposed on the 6 cm continuum image , as shown in figure 3c .",
    "given the mismatch between the 2@xmath29 resolution of molecular line data based on ast / ro observations and radio continuum data , the distribution of molecular gas is similar to that of dark radio clouds .",
    "the continuum image reveals detailed morphological structures of a giant molecular cloud on arcsecond spatial resolution especially at the boundary of the molecular cloud near the continuum source .",
    "we also made cross cuts at b=@xmath30 across the 6 cm and molecular line images , as shown on figure 3d .",

    "radio continuum images show rdc-1 which appears to coincide with the southern edge of irdc that surrounds the cluster of uc hii regions in sgr b2 ( de pree et al .",
    "we also note a decrease in the radio flux at 6 and 20 cm between sgr b2 and the isolated radio continuum feature g0.73 - 0.10 .",

    "4c across the rdc-1 are made using the 6 cm continuum and 450@xmath32 m images .",
    "the profiles of emission , as shown in figure 4d , show flux deficiencies of 5 and 2 mjy which imply that the depths of the ionized gas for the two dips are similar to and twice larger than those of molecular gas , respectively . because of the large number of bright compact hii regions in sgr b2 , the cross cuts also show fluctuations due to emission from individual compact sources .",
    "* sgr a east snr & sgr a west : * given its gaseous environment with a strong radiation field , the inner ten parsecs of the galactic center is an excellent site to search for rdcs tracing molecular clouds that interact with the strong radiation field or with expanding supernova remnants .",
