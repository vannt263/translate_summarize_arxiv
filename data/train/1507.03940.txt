    "the high - luminosity lhc , with 3 ab@xmath117 can exclude a @xmath0 vector resonance up to about 2.1 tev .",
    "this mass range for the @xmath0 is quite in tension with the electroweak - precision - tests , since the s parameter gives a lower bound of about 2 tev on the @xmath0 mass @xcite .",

    "a futuristic 100 tev pp collider has a much wider sensitivity . the upper plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach-100 ] shows that a futuristic 100 tev collider can discover , at 5@xmath111 , a @xmath0 in the vbf channel with masses up to 5.1 ( 4 ) tev with 10 ( 1 ) ab@xmath117 of integrated luminosity in the large @xmath7 coupling region .",

    "these values refer to a jet - rapidity acceptance @xmath118 .",
    "we find that the reach of a future 100 tev pp collider is significantly enhanced , by about a 10% in the @xmath0 mass reach , if the rapidity acceptance on the jets can be increased from 5 , the present lhc-14 acceptance , up to 6 .",
    "in this study we have presented a first estimate of the reach of future pp colliders , the 14 tev lhc and a futuristic 100 tev pp collider , on a vector resonance , specifically a @xmath0 , produced via vbf , and decaying dominantly into @xmath1 .",

    "in particular , in mchm with partial compositeness , the standard dy production channel is suppressed at large coupling while the vbf production is enhanced and could thus provide a unique opportunity to directly test the large - coupling regime of the theory .",
    "+ we have derived a search strategy for the @xmath0 produced by vbf and decaying to @xmath1 and obtained the estimated reach of the 14 tev lhc and of a 100 tev pp collider on the ( mass , coupling ) @xmath0 parameter space .",

    "fig : reach-14 ] for lhc-14 and in fig .",
    "[ fig : reach-100 ] for the 100 tev collider .",
    "we find that , due to a low vbf production cross section at @xmath13 tev , the lhc-14 can access only a small portion of the @xmath0 parameter space , with the possibility to exclude a @xmath0 vector resonance up to about 2.1 tev with 3 ab@xmath117 in the large - coupling regime .",
    "although this region of parameter space has some tension with electroweak precision data , an analysis of the vbf channel at lhc-14 could provide a direct complementary confirmation of the exclusion .",
    "[ fig : reach-100 ] shows that the sensitivity of a future 100 tev collider on a @xmath0 produced via vbf is high .",
    "the discovery reach , at 5@xmath111 , extends up to @xmath0 masses of 5.1 ( 4 ) tev with 10 ( 1 ) ab@xmath117 of integrated luminosity in the large - coupling region . while a future 100 tev collider can exclude a @xmath0 in the large - coupling regime , with masses up to 6.1 ( 5.1 ) tev with 10 ( 1 ) ab@xmath117 .",
    "we finally find that the 100 tev collider reach is considerably increased for a jet rapidity acceptance extended up to @xmath118 .",
