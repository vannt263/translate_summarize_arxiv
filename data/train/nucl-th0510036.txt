    "these calculations have shown that realistic nn - interactions , supplemented by a three - body force , are able to describe the nuclear structure of light isotopes quite well . however , due to their computational complexity , these practically exact numerical solutions of the quantum many - body problem can not be applied to nuclei beyond the @xmath4-shell .",
    "strong correlations in the many - body system are the basic issue which has to be addressed when starting from a realistic nn interaction",
    ". the naive use of a bare realistic potential , e.g. argonne v18 ( av18 ) @xcite or cd bonn @xcite , in a simple many - body approximation like hartree - fock ( hf ) will not lead to sensible results .",
    "the many - body states of the hf approximation are slater determinants , i.e. , independent particle states incapable of describing any correlations .",
    "already the deuteron elucidates the nature of the dominant interaction - induced correlations .",
    "the relative two - body wave function shows a strong suppression at small particle distances , which is generated by the short - range repulsive core in the central part of the realistic interaction .",
    "the propability density of finding any two nucleons in a nucleus ( two - body density ) at relative distances smaller than the radius of this core is very small .",
    "furthermore , in addition to the @xmath5-wave part , the ground state contains a @xmath6-wave admixture generated by the strong and long - ranged tensor potential .",
    "the @xmath6-wave component and thus the tensor force are essential for nuclear binding , not only in the case of the deuteron .",

    "the central step on the way towards nuclear structure calculations for heavy nuclei based on realistic potentials is the combination of tractable many - body approximations with an appropriate description of interaction - induced correlations . in most cases ,",
    "this is effectively achieved by converting the bare realistic interaction into an effective interaction adapted to the available model space .",

    "alternatively , the correlation operator can be used to transform the operators of the relevant observables . from the transformation of the hamiltonian including a realistic nn interaction , we obtain a correlated interaction @xmath0 which can be used in conjunction with uncorrelated many - body states .",

    "if we start with an uncorrelated state with @xmath52 , @xmath26 , and @xmath53 , then the correlated state acquires an additional @xmath54 admixture , whose radial dependence is determined by the tensor correlation function @xmath55 .",
    "the relations for the correlated two - body states form the basis for the evaluation of the matrix elements of correlated operators without approximations .",
    "one of the virtues of the description of correlations by a state - independent unitary transformation is that instead of working with correlated states , one can also apply the unitary correlator onto the operators of interest and define correlated operators @xmath56 for the calculation of observables , e.g. , expectation values or matrix elements , the formulations in terms of correlated operators and correlated states are fully equivalent and one can choose whichever is technically more convenient .",

    "hence , it can be interpreted as an indication for the necessity of a net effective three - body force , i.e. a combination of the genuine three - body force and the three - body contributions of the cluster expansion .",
    "we have employed the unitary correlation operator method for describing the dominant short - range correlations induced by realistic nn - potentials in a simple hartree - fock framework .",
    "based on the argonne v18 potential with optimal correlation functions determined in the two - body system and a range constraint for the tensor correlation functions fixed in three- and four - body systems , we have performed hf and mbpt calculations for spherical nuclei throughout the nuclear chart .",
    "we obtain bound nuclei using the correlated av18 potential already at the hf level .",
    "this proves that the dominant short - range central and tensor correlations are successfully described by the unitary correlation operators . without the proper inclusion of both types of correlations",
    "it is not possible to obtain self - bound solutions in a hf framework using the av18 potential .",
    "however , the hf binding energies remain significantly smaller than the experimental binding energies .",
    "the same holds true for charge radii . on the other hand ,",
    "the single - particle energy differences between spin - orbit partner states show a satisfactory agreement with experimental estimates .",
    "the missing binding energy is connected to residual long - range correlations , which are not described by the unitary correlation operators .",
    "they have to be covered by the model space and the slater determinant of the hf approximation is clearly not able to do so .",
    "many - body perturbation theory as the simplest possible step beyond the hf ground state already recovers the missing binding energy .",
    "the agreement between second order ground state energies and experimental data is remarkably good throughout the whole mass range from @xmath1 to @xmath2 , even far off the valley of stability . unlike the short - range central and tensor correlations ,",
    "the residual long - range correlations are perturbative .",
    "this opens interesting perspectives for the application of more refined many - body techniques , like configuration interaction and coupled - cluster schemes , to benchmark the perturbative results and obtain a more detailed insight into the structure of those correlations .",
    "none of the calculations presented here does include three - body forces .",
    "therefore , it is surprising that a good agreement with the experimental binding energies was observed for all nuclei considered .",
    "this is due to a net cancellation of the energy contributions of the genuine three - body force ( attractive ) and the three - body order of the cluster expansion ( repulsive ) .",
    "this was already observed in no - core shell model calculations for light systems @xcite , but seems to hold across the whole nuclear chart .",
    "obviously , this cancellation effect does not necessarily work for other observables as well .",
    "the charge radii , which still show a sizable deviation from experiment after including long - range correlations , point into that direction .",
    "the construction and inclusion of effective three - body forces will therefore be one of the major lines of research for the future .",
    "this work is supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft through contract sfb 634 .",
    "we thank the institute for nuclear theory at the university of washington for its hospitality and the department of energy for partial support during the completion of this work ."
