    "neutrinos are convenient for studying lorentz violation due to their small mass and high velocities",
    ". previous research has considered neutrino oscillations with short@xcite and long@xcite baselines , but mostly zero or constant matter effects .",
    "very little has been done with variable matter effects , such as those in the sun .",
    "we attempt to develop a perturbative technique for easily calculating lorentz - violating effects in solar - neutrino oscillations .",
    "we assume neutrinos have the standard mass differences , and treat lorentz violation as a perturbative effect .",
    "the neutrino hamiltonian thus has three terms @xmath0 where the first term on the right - hand side is the standard vacuum hamiltonian , @xmath1 is the sun s matter potential , and @xmath2 is a small lorentz - violating hamiltonian .",
    "the diagonal mass squared matrix @xmath3 and the unitary mixing matrix @xmath4 take the standard form , using the approximate observed values @xmath5 since @xmath6 and @xmath7 , muon and tau neutrinos mix equally and @xmath8 .",
    "given this similarity , it is convenient to group muon and tau together and consider only two flavors . in this case",
    ", there are only two parameters : a mixing angle @xmath9 and a mass difference @xmath3 , equivalent to @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively , in the three - generation case .",
    "this significantly simplifies many calculations .",
    "the two - generation case will be considered for the remainder of this work .",
    "the sun produces very large quantities of electron neutrinos in its core . as they propagate to the surface",
    ", they interact with matter .",
    "this effect can be described by the sun s matter potential @xmath1 , given approximately by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath14 is the number density of electrons in the sun , and @xmath15 is the solar radius.@xcite    the variable matter potential precludes an exact solution ; however , provided the hamiltonian changes sufficiently slowly , approximate analytic expressions can be obtained using the adiabatic approximation .",
    "this approximation assumes energy eigenstates change slowly enough that neutrinos do not transition between them as they propagate .",
    "high - frequency oscillations between flavors can then be averaged away , resulting in simpler expressions than in previous work , such as reference .",
    "the averages can be calculated from @xmath16 where the superscript ( 0 ) indicates that these are zeroth - order ( lorentz - invariant ) probabilities , @xmath4 is the vacuum mixing matrix , and @xmath17 is the effective mixing matrix at @xmath18 .",
    "this evaluates to @xmath19 where @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath9 is the vacuum mixing angle , and @xmath22 is the effective mixing angle at @xmath18 .",
    "note that the matter potential only needs to be known at the center and surface of the sun .",
    "shows the electron neutrino survival probability as a function of energy .",
    "the adiabatic approximation agrees with the numerical solution almost exactly .",
    "lorentz violation is a natural extension to the theory . assuming lorentz violation is sufficiently small , it can be treated as a first - order perturbation to the zeroth - order probabilities from .",
    "the lorentz - violating term has the form@xcite @xmath23_{ab}\\ ] ] where @xmath24 , @xmath25 are complex lorentz - violating coefficients and @xmath26 is the neutrino energy - momentum four - vector , @xmath27 .",
    "the coefficients @xmath28 , @xmath29 are isotropic and hence introduce changes to energy dependence , while the remaining coefficients are anisotropic and cause annual variations .",
    "the cpt - odd @xmath24 are constant with energy ; the cpt - even @xmath25 are linear .",
    "the probabilities from the adiabatic approximation become @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a unitless , order one effective scale factor for @xmath2 , used to calculate perturbed probabilities via simple linear combinations of coefficients .",
    "it is determined by expanding the lorentz - violating sine and cosine to leading order , which gives @xmath32 and @xmath33 , where @xmath34 is the difference between the two eigenvalues at @xmath18 .",
    "shows the effects of the isotropic coefficients on the energy dependence of the electron neutrino survival probability .",
    "the first - order expansion is effective with nonzero @xmath35 , especially at low energies .",
    "it begins to fail with nonzero @xmath36 at high energies , since these effects grow with energy .",
    "however , the sun does not produce neutrinos with energies higher than approximately 10 mev , so this shortcoming is of limited relevance .",
    "solar neutrinos are convenient for the study of lorentz violation due to the large quantities and significantly lower energy and longer baseline than accelerator experiments .",
    "the adiabatic approximation allows simple and accurate calculations of lorentz - violating effects in solar - neutrino oscillations .    further work will generalize the analysis to the three - generation case and explore additional consequences of lorentz violation , such as annual variations caused by nonzero anisotropic coefficients and neutrino - antineutrino mixing"
