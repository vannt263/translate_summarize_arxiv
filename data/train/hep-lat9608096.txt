    "recently , increased attention has been paid on lattice glueball computations  @xcite .",
    "it is demanding to include sea quarks into such studies as two new effects are expected to set in : the scalar glueball becomes unstable and can decay into two @xmath5 s ( at sufficiently light sea quark mass ) . also , mixing with mesonic @xmath6 states",
    "might occur . in this case",
    ", the glueball will just add an additional excitation to the singlet state of the @xmath7 , @xmath8 meson quartet ( nonet in full qcd with three light flavours of sea quarks ) , which does not fit into the constituent quark model .",
    "in fact , one can equally well speak of a meson with valence quarks and sea glue as of a glueball with valence glue and sea quarks . only the couplings to certain decay channels can discriminate which of these two features dominates in either state . depending on the quark masses , a glueball creation operator will project onto all these states ( @xmath9 and mixed meson - glue states ) .",
    "one aim of the present study is to look for unexpected or dramatic effects around such thresholds .",
    "in addition to glueballs , we study so called torelon states , i.e. flux tubes wrapping around the lattice ( with periodic spatial boundary conditions ) . in case of the valence quark approximation ,",
    "the mass of such a state is ( up to finite size corrections ) expected to equal @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the spatial extent of the lattice ( here : @xmath12 ) and @xmath13 stands for the string tension .",
    "when dynamical sea quark flavours are switched on , the lightest such state ( @xmath14 ) can , at sufficiently large lattice extent , decay into either a scalar meson or into two @xmath5 s or mix with glueball states through intermediate mesonic states . in the torelon",
    "we expect to be sensitive to `` string breaking '' effects .",
    "it is well known from quenched studies that gluonic observables suffer from large statistical fluctuations and small signals  @xcite .",
    "early studies with staggered sea quarks  @xcite indicate that it might be extremely difficult to obtain significant results on glueballs with dynamical fermions at all in realistic time . in view of the interesting physics involved ,",
    "we wish to explore the situation with our medium size sample of configurations .",
    "we compute matrices of zero - momentum projected plaquette - plaquette and wilsonline - wilsonline correlators at various fuzzing levels  @xcite .",
    "two different fuzzing procedures have been applied for this purpose :    1 .",
    "successive factor two blocking  @xcite with the straight connection weighted by a coefficient @xmath15 , in respect to the neighbouring four spatial staples , 2 .   alternating between conventional ape smearing steps with @xmath16 ( keeping the length of the fuzzed link constant ) and the above factor two blocking steps .",
    "within procedure 1 , the fuzzing levels are labeled by @xmath17 , corresponding to links of effective length @xmath18 in lattice units . within procedure 2 ,",
    "two successive levels correspond to fuzzed links of equal length , i.e.  levels 0 and 1 yield links of extent 1 while 6 and 7 yield links of length 8 .",
    "procedure 1 has been applied onto 2196 successive trajectories at @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 while procedure 2 has so far been applied to 204 , 274 and 260 configurations , separated by about 10 trajectories , at @xmath22 , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , respectively .",
    "prior to statistical analysis the data has been binned into sufficiently large blocks to achieve stability of the error estimates in respect to the block size , i.e.  to avoid autocorrelations .",
    "statistical errors have been computed from the scatter between 500 bootstrap samples in either case .",
    "operators with quantum numbers @xmath14 ( the lightest torelon state ) , @xmath25 ( projecting onto the @xmath8 glueball ) and @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) have been constructed at each fuzzing level .",
    "after diagonalizing the @xmath28 submatrix between the two basis states with best ground state overlap in each case , masses of the glueball and torelon states are extracted .    applying fuzzing procedure 1 ,",
    "levels 2 and 3 have been found to project best onto the glueball ground states while just level 3 resulted in a satsifying overlaps for the torelon case . for fuzzing 2 , levels 6 and 5 ( 7 and 6 for the torelon ) are optimal .",
    "after diagonalizing the corresponding correlation submatrices , we obtain ground state overlaps of @xmath29 for the @xmath30 glueball and @xmath31 for the torelon by use of fuzzing 1 . with procedure 2 ,",
    "glueball overlaps of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 and torelon overlaps of @xmath35 , @xmath36 and @xmath37 have been achieved for the three @xmath38 values , respectively , resulting in an earlier onset of plateaus in local masses and , thus , reduced statistical errors of final results .",

    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] we compare our results for the torelon mass at @xmath23 from the two fuzzing procedures .",
    "the numerical values are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , in agreement with an expectation of @xmath41 , as computed from the linear slope of the interquark potential  @xcite .",
