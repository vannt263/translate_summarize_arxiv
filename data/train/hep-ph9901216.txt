    "my talk concerns the so - called single spin asymmetries in high energy physics . these are hyperons transverse polarization  observed for several hyperons produced in the scattering of unpolarized nucleons  or left - right asymmetry of pions produced from transversely polarized proton beams on unpolarized nucleon target @xcite .",
    "these phenomena have not yet a satisfactory commonly accepted explanation , in spite of many years past since their first discovery and the abundance of experimental information ; all single spin asymmetries are vanishing for quark and gluons interactions in perturbative qcd and the large experimental values observed for hadrons must originate from basic non perturbative properties of nucleon structure and quark hadronization processes .",
    "important progresses towards their understanding have recently been made and a dedicated effort should bring much more valuable understanding .",
    "one of the hypotheses is a non - zero t - odd quark distribution @xcite or / and quark fragmentation functions @xcite responsible for left - right quark asymmetry inside a transversely polarized nucleon or left - right asymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark .",
    "the existence of the above functions would result in peculiar asymmetries for final hadronic states , like handedness @xcite or the so - called collins asymmetry @xcite .",
    "some new experimental indication for the existence of these asymmetries has been recently obtained @xcite and several experimental tests have been proposed @xcite .",
    "this indications are considered below in more detail .",
    "the transfer of nucleon polarization to quarks is investigated in deep - inelastic polarized lepton  polarized nucleon scattering experiments @xcite .",
    "the corresponding nucleon spin structure functions for the longitudinal spin distribution @xmath5 and transversal spin distribution @xmath6 for proton are well known . the _ opposite _ process , the spin transfer from partons to a final hadron , is also of fundamental interest .",
    "analogies of @xmath7 and @xmath6 are functions @xmath8 and @xmath9 , which describe the fragmentation of a non - polarized quark into a non - polarized hadron and a longitudinally or transversely polarized quark into a longitudinally or transversely polarized hadron , respectively .",
    "these fragmentation functions are integrated over the transverse momentum @xmath10 of a quark with respect to a hadron . with @xmath10 taken into account ,",
    "new possibilities arise . using the lorentz- and p - invariance",
    "one can write in the leading twist approximation 8 independent spin structures @xcite .",
    "most spectacularly it is seen in the helicity basis where one can build 8 twist-2 combinations , linear in spin matrices of the quark and hadron @xmath11 , @xmath12 with momenta @xmath13 , @xmath14 . especially interesting is a new t - odd and helicity even structure that describes a left ",
    "right asymmetry in the fragmentation of a transversely polarized quark : @xmath15 where the coefficient @xmath16 is a functions of the longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath17 , quark transversal momentum @xmath18 and @xmath19 is an average transverse momentum .    in the case of fragmentation to a non - polarized or a zero spin hadron , not only @xmath20 but also the @xmath16 term will survive . together with its analogies in distribution functions @xmath21 and @xmath22 , this opens a unique chance of doing spin physics with non - polarized or zero spin hadrons !",
    "in particular , since the @xmath16 term is helicity - odd , it makes possible to measure the proton transversity distribution @xmath6 in semi - inclusive dis from a transversely polarized target by measuring the left - right asymmetry of forward produced pions ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the problem is that , first , this function is completely unknown both theoretically and experimentally and should be measured independently .",
    "second , that the function @xmath16 is the so - called t - odd fragmentation function : under the naive time reversal @xmath23 and @xmath11 change sign , which demands a purely imaginary ( or zero ) @xmath16 in the contradiction with hermiticity .",
    "this , however , does not mean the break of t - invariance but rather the presence of an interference term of different channels in forming the final state with different phase shifts , like in the case of the single spin asymmetry phenomena  @xcite . a simple model for this function could be found in  @xcite .",
    "it was also conjectured  @xcite that the final state phase shift can average to zero for a single hadron fragmentation upon summing over unobserved states @xmath24 .",
    "thus , the situation here is far from being clear .",
    "meanwhile , the data collected by delphi ( and other lep experiments ) give a unique possibility to measure the function @xmath16 .",
    "the point is that despite the fact that the transverse polarization of a quark ( an antiquark ) in z@xmath25 decay is very small ( @xmath26 ) , there is a non - trivial correlation between transverse polarizations of a quark and an antiquark in the standard model : @xmath27 , which reaches rather high values at @xmath28 peak : @xmath29 and @xmath30 . with the production cross section ratio @xmath31",
    "this gives the value @xmath32 for the average over flavors .",
    "the spin correlation results in a peculiar azimuthal angle dependence of produced hadrons ( the so - called `` one - particle collins asymmetry '' ) , if the t - odd fragmentation function @xmath16 does exist  @xcite . the first probe of it was done three years ago  @xcite by using a limited delphi statistics with the result @xmath33 , as averaged over quark flavors .",
    "a simpler method has been proposed recently by an amsterdam group @xcite .",
    "they predict a specific azimuthal asymmetry of a hadron in a jet around the axis in direction of the second hadron in the opposite jet : dependence for @xmath34 and @xmath35 integrated over @xmath36 . ] @xmath37 ^ 2 c_{tt}^{q\\bar",
    "q}{\\sin^2\\theta_2\\over    1+\\cos^2\\theta_2}\\cos(2\\phi_1)\\right ) \\label{mulders}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath38 is the polar angle of the electron and the second hadron momenta @xmath39 , and @xmath40 is the azimuthal angle counted off the @xmath41-plane .",
    "this looks simpler since there is no need to determine the @xmath42 direction .",
    "this analysis covered the delphi data collected from 1991 through 1995 .",
    "all particles were generically assumed to be pions .",
    "only charged particles were analyzed .",
    "about 3.5 millions of @xmath43 hadronic decays were selected by using the standard selection criteria  @xcite .",
    "jets were reconstructed by the jade algorithm with varying the parameter @xmath44 or @xmath45 .",
    "only 2-jet events were retained for the analysis with additional thrust value selection requirement either @xmath46 or @xmath47 . to get rid of low efficiency of the end - caps of the detector , events with the polar angle of the sphericity axis @xmath48 were cut off and tracks with @xmath49 were rejected , too .",
    "in addition , the acollinearity of the two jets @xmath50 was required to be @xmath51 . a leading particle in each jet was selected both positive and negative .    to study the detector response , a sample of monte - carlo events , generated with jetset and passed through the same analysis chain as the data , was used . with these events , the correction factor @xmath52",
    "was built for each bin in the azimuthal angle of the first leading particle @xmath40 and in the polar angle of the leading particle from the opposite jet @xmath38 ( see expr .",
    "( [ mulders ] ) ) .",
    "the true distribution was defined as @xmath53 and histograms in @xmath40 for each bin of @xmath38 were fitted by the expression   is due to the twist-3 contribution of usual one - particle fragmentation , proportional to the @xmath54 . ]",
    "@xmath55      for raw data",
    "@xmath56 is positive ( @xmath57 ) for @xmath38 close to @xmath58 but it becomes negative ( up to @xmath59 ) for @xmath38 close to @xmath60 and @xmath61 . the same property but with a larger value of @xmath62 ( @xmath63 in the vicinity of @xmath58 ) is shown by mc - simulated events too .",
    "this feature is clearly interpreted as a consequence of low efficiency of the delphi detector in the end - cups region and of the polar angle cut - offs .    indeed , track 1 is more close to the cone of the `` dead zone '' when the angle @xmath40 is close to @xmath61 ( for @xmath64 ) or to @xmath60 ( for @xmath65 ) , which decreases the number of events at the ends of @xmath40-histogram and produces a negative value of @xmath66 .",
    "in contrast to this , the low efficiency between tpc - segments of the detector decreases in the number of events in the center of the @xmath40-histogram ( near @xmath58 ) and produces a positive values of @xmath66 .",
    "the positivity area increases for stronger jet selection criteria ( smaller @xmath67 and larger @xmath68-cut ) with more narrow jets , but the value of @xmath66 decreases .",
    "the @xmath69 for pure jetset shows a weaker dependence on @xmath38 and is much smaller in magnitude . in the region",
    "@xmath70 this parameter is zero within the error bars .",
    "therefore this region was considered as the most reliable for the determination of @xmath71 .",
    "r5.5 cm fig.1 .",
    "the @xmath38-dependence of the @xmath71 .    the best result for corrected data",
    "was obtained for @xmath72 and @xmath47 selections .",
    "the value of @xmath71 averaged over the region @xmath70 and over quarks flavors with @xmath32 was found to be @xmath73 the corresponding analyzing power according to exp .",
    "( [ mulders ] ) is @xmath74    regretfully , a rather small value of @xmath71 and , especially , the fact that it was obtained effectively as a result of subtraction of much larger values of @xmath56 and @xmath62 do not allow us to consider the @xmath38-dependence of @xmath71 seriously . nevertheless , we risk to present this dependence in the whole interval of @xmath38 in fig.1 with corresponding fit @xmath75 which increases the value of analyzing power ( [ apower ] ) up to @xmath76 .",
    "the distinction with ( [ apower ] ) demonstrates , however , that systematic errors are by all means larger than the statistical ones and need further investigation .    to study this dependence in more detail",
    ", one has to increase the statistics .",
    "it could be gained by inclusion not only the leading but also next - to - leading particles into study . also , the classical `` collins effect '' should be investigated and confronted with the effect obtained .",
    "the concept of jet handedness was introduced as a measure of polarization of parent partons ( or hadrons ) @xcite . for a strong interaction process",
    ", parity conservation requires that at least three particles ( either spinless or spin - averaged ) in a final state or a pair of particles and jet direction were measured in order to build a correlation of final momenta in the fragmentation ( or decay ) with initial polarization .",
    "namely , from three particle momenta one can construct a pseudovector @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) which gives , when contracted with the initial polarization pseudovector , a scalar component in the strong process .",
    "thus , measuring the handedness  the asymmetry in relative number of events @xmath79 with respect to some projection of @xmath80 to a direction @xmath81 in the rest frame of the triple",
    " can give an information on the initial polarization @xmath82 in this direction ( at least for spin 1/2 and 1 ) @xmath83 provided the analyzing power @xmath84 is large enough .",
    "the direction @xmath81 could be chosen as longitudinal ( @xmath85 ) with respect to the triple momentum @xmath13 and as transversal ones ( @xmath86 or @xmath87 ) perpendicular to @xmath13 .    in the previous publication",
    "@xcite the attention was drawn to the fact that in diffractive production of pion triples  @xcite @xmath88 by @xmath4 beam @xmath89 from a nucleus @xmath90 , a noticeable asymmetry with respect to the triple production plane ( transversal handedness @xmath91 ) was observed . here",
    "i will talk about further experimental investigation of this phenomenon  @xcite .",
    "it includes a new information on the dependence of the transversal handedness on the variables :    * atomic number of the target , * transversal momenta of the pion triple , * feynmann variable @xmath92 of the leading @xmath4 , * invariant mass of the triple , * invariant mass of neutral pairs @xmath93 .",
    "also the statistics was considerably increased .      for reaction ( [ react ] )",
    ", let us define the normal to the plane of production of a secondary pion triple @xmath94 @xmath95 where @xmath96 and @xmath97 are velocities of the initial @xmath4 beam and the center of mass of the triple in lab .",
    "indices @xmath98 and @xmath99 label fast and slow @xmath4 s . the normal to the `` decay plane '' of the triple in its center of mass is defined as @xmath100 where @xmath101 or @xmath102 are velocities of the fast ( slow ) @xmath4 or @xmath103 .",
    "the transversal handedness according to ( [ hand ] ) is @xmath104 two other components of the handedness connected with @xmath105 and @xmath106 are forbidden by the parity conservation in the strong interaction .",
    "the transversal handedness ( [ trahand ] ) was measured for a wide sample of nuclear targets : @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "the total number of selected events of pion triples with leading @xmath4 was about 250,000 .",
    "br5.7 cm + fig.2 .",
    "@xmath90-dependence of the handedness .",
    "the dependence of @xmath91 on the atomic number @xmath90 is presented in fig.2 .",
    "one can see that the handedness systematically decreases with increasing @xmath90 , which resembles a depolarization effect in multiple scattering .",
    "an argument in this favor is the decrease of the effect as , approximately , inverse nuclei radius .",
    "the value of the asymmetry ( [ trahand ] ) , averaged over all nuclei is @xmath110 statistically , this is highly reliable verification of the existence of correlation of the triple production and decay planes in process ( [ react ] ) .",
    "the values of two other asymmetries with respect to correlations @xmath111 and @xmath106 was found to be comparable to zero from the same statistical material : @xmath112 and @xmath113 respectively .",
    "this is by no means surprising , since they are forbidden by the parity conservation .",
    "hbr5.7 cm    a natural question is to what extent the effect observed is due to the kinematics or apparatus influence , in particular , due to acceptance of the experimental setup where the events have been registered . for this aim",
    "the monte - carlo events of reaction ( [ react ] ) were generated with a constant mass spectrum of the @xmath114system in the interval 0.62.5 @xmath115 and with the exponential decrease of the cross section in @xmath116 with the slope ( for beryllium ) @xmath117 , found experimentally .",
    "this events were traced through the apparatus simulation and the same selection of events shows no transversal handedness @xmath91 @xmath118 for two other asymmetries , forbidden by the parity conservation , the result was @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .",
    "thus , the effect ( [ result ] ) can not be explained by the kinematics or apparatus influence .    to understand",
    "the nature of the effect observed , the dependence of the handedness ( [ trahand ] ) on the feynmann variable @xmath92 of the leading @xmath4 , on the invariant mass of the triple @xmath121 and its neutral subsystem @xmath122 and on the triple transversal momentum @xmath123 was studied . from fig.3",
    "one can see that the handedness ( [ trahand ] ) increases with @xmath92 , which resembles the behavior of the single spin asymmetry ( e.g. the pion asymmetry or the @xmath124-polarization  @xcite ) .",
    "+ fig.4 . the handedness dependence on @xmath121 ( a ) and @xmath125 ( b ) .",
    "the dependence of @xmath91 on the triple invariant mass ( fig.4a ) is especially interesting .",
    "it clearly indicates two different sources of @xmath91 with comparable contributions : a resonant and a non - resonant one .",
    "the resonance contribution is clearly seen at the mass of @xmath126 and @xmath127 region and by no means is due to a non - zero polarization of the resonances .",
    "the non - resonant background could also be polarized , provided that the @xmath114 system is predominantly in a state with the total angular momentum @xmath128 , e.g. if a neutral pair @xmath122 was predominantly produced from @xmath129-decay .",
    "some indication of this can be seen from fig.4b . in this context , the growth of @xmath91 in the region of small @xmath121 , i.e. in the region of small relative momenta of pions , looks quite intriguing .",
    "a complicated picture of the @xmath123-dependence with a sharp deep at @xmath130 ( fig.5 ) reflects by all means the fact of interference of the resonant and non - resonant processes in the triple production . with further increase of @xmath123",
    "the handedness increases which resembles the single spin asymmetry behavior too .",
    "hr6.5 cm + fig.5 .",
    "the @xmath123-dependence of the handedness .    to check this assumption the events with invariant mass @xmath121 in the @xmath131 and @xmath132 resonance region @xmath133@xmath134 were excluded from further analysis .",
    "this however does not lead us to a definite conclusion since for @xmath135 and @xmath136 the deep disappears while conserves for @xmath137 with some change of its form and width .",
    "the average value of the handedness stays at the same level 511% with high statistical significance .",
    "notice also that in earlier study of reaction ( [ react ] ) at @xmath138 for the proton target at the hydrogen bubble chamber no angular dependence of the normal @xmath80 ( [ norm ] ) was found just as in the regge pole exchange model , which provides a reasonable description of that experiment  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we present some arguments in favor of a non - zero t - odd transversely polarized quark fragmentation function and the transverse handedness .",
    "the corresponding analyzing power could reach an order of 10 per cent , which makes us hope to use this effects for measuring of the transverse quark polarization in other hard processes .",
    "in particular , it can be used in the deep inelastic scattering for measurement of nucleon transversity distribution , since helicity evenness of @xmath16 .",
    "further increase of the accuracy and the investigation of systematic errors are required .",
    "the transverse handedness has a clear dynamical origin and in some features resembles the single spin asymmetry behavior . for a more detailed study of the phenomenon , a partial wave analysis of reaction ( [ react ] )",
    "seems necessary .",
