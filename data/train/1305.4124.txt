    "the transiting super - earth gj 1214b is the first planet discovered by the mearth survey charbonneau09 and is currently the only super - earth that has been observed using transmission spectroscopy .",
    "the planet s mass and radius are 6.16@xmath20.91@xmath3  and 2.71@xmath20.24@xmath4  respectively anglada - escude13 , giving it a low bulk density of 1.68 g @xmath5 .",
    "this density is consistent with either a water - rich planet or planet with a dense iron / rock core and hydrogen / helium envelope nettelmann11 , seager07 , rogers10 .",
    "rogers10 proposed three general mechanisms by which gj 1214b may have accumulated its atmosphere .",
    "the planet may have accreted a hydrogen / helium envelope from the stellar nebula , outgassed a hydrogen envelope from a rocky planet , or contain a high water content in the interior with a hydrogen - depleted , water - rich envelope .",
    "nettelmann11 argue that the water - rich hypothesis would require unreasonably large bulk water - to - rock ratios , suggesting that the atmosphere must be at least partially composed of hydrogen and helium . by measuring the composition of gj 1214b s atmosphere using transmission spectroscopy",
    ", we can potentially distinguish between these hypotheses .      during a transit , the light from the host star passes through the atmosphere of the transiting planet . because the opacity of the atmosphere varies with wavelength",
    ", the radius of the planet will appear to vary with wavelength .",
    "the depth of features in the transmission spectrum scales as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 ( the number of scale heights probed ) is set by the opacities involved ( @xmath8 ) , @xmath9 is the atmospheric scale height , @xmath10  is the planetary radius , and @xmath11 is the stellar radius seager00 , hubbard01 .",
    "the scale height @xmath9 is inversely proportional to the mean molecular weight @xmath12 of the atmosphere . by measuring the depth of transit features",
    ", we probe the mean molecular weight of the atmosphere and can thus probe whether the atmosphere is h / he - rich ( @xmath13 ) or a higher mean molecular weight h@xmath14o ( @xmath15 ) atmosphere miller - ricci09 .",
    "cloud opacity , due to equilibrium and non - equilibrium processes , can be readily seen in the atmosphere of every planet and moon with an atmosphere in our solar system .",
    "these include sulfuric acid clouds on venus prinn73 , water and carbon dioxide clouds on mars montmessin06 , whiteway09 , ammonia clouds on jupiter baines02 , ammonia and water clouds on saturn sromovsky83 , baines09 , sanchez - lavega11 , methane clouds and tholin haze on titan brown10 , dekok07 , and methane - derived clouds and hazes on uranus pollack87 , irwin07 , karkoschka09 and neptune hammel89 , max03 , gibbard03 .",
    "it has long been recognized that clouds could impact the transmission spectrum of transiting exoplanets as well seager00,brown01b , hubbard01 .",
    "furthermore , at the slant viewing geometry relevant for transmission spectroscopy , it has been suggested that long light path lengths through the atmosphere could lead even minor condensates to become optically thick , thereby obscuring gaseous absorption features fortney05c .",
    "transmission spectroscopy has been successfully used to probe the atmospheres of hot jupiters , enabling the detection of atoms , molecules , and even clouds [ e.g.][]charbonneau02 , pont08 , sing08a . for gj 1214b ,",
    "if the atmosphere is h / he - rich the features are predicted to change the planet s radius by @xmath160.1% which would be detectable with current instruments miller - ricci10 .",
    "if the atmosphere is instead water - rich with @xmath15 , the features will be a factor of @xmath17 smaller and the spectrum could appear featureless at the observational precision of current instrumentation .",
    "numerous observations of the transmission spectrum of gj 1214b have been made from optical through near - infrared wavelengths from both ground and space .",
    "bean10 , using the very large telescope , found that the transmission spectrum is featureless between 0.78 and 1.0 .",
    "desert11c s broad - band photometric observations using the _ spitzer space telescope _ at 3.6 and 4.5  showed a flat spectrum .",
    "the high resolution nirspec spectrum from crossfield11 also showed a featureless spectrum .",
    "croll11 , contradicting the other measurements , found a deeper _ k_-band ( 2.2 ) transit using the canada france hawaii telescope , consistent with the larger features of an h@xmath14-rich atmosphere .",
    "berta12 obtained a near - ir spectrum using wide field camera 3 on the _ hubble space telescope _ and found a transmission spectrum consistent with a featureless specturm .",
    "demooij12 observed the transit of gj 1214b in the optical bands _",
    "g _ , _ r _ , _ i _ , _ i _ and _ z _ and near - infrared bands _",
    "k@xmath18 _ and _ k@xmath19 _ and found all but the _ g_-band observation to be consistent with a featureless spectrum .",
    "g_-band point has a slightly higher radius , possibly indicative of scattering .",
    "murgas12 observed gj 1214b using the gran telescopio canarias with a narrow - band tunable filter at three bands : one centered on the line core of h@xmath20 and two in the continuum , centered on either side .",
    "their data are consistent with previous observations , but show a high intrinsic scatter .",
    "fraine13 re - observe the transit of gj 1214b with _",
    "spitzer _ and in _ i+z _ bands from the ground ; their results are also consistent with a featureless spectrum or a water - vapor atmosphere , and find that their best - fitting model has a transit radius that increases into the optical , indicative of a scattering constituent in the upper atmosphere .",
    "we note that some of the observations disagree with each other to high significance , especially in the near - infrared _ k_-band .",
    "impartially , we adopt the errors published in the literature and accept that no model will agree with all points .",
    "fortney05c suggested that in the slant viewing geometry of transmission spectroscopy , minor condensates could have appreciable optical depth .",
    "these minor condensates and hazes would lead to weaker than expected or undetected gaseous absorption features .",
    "several previous studies have included some of the effects of clouds in gj 1214b s atmosphere .",
    "one method of including cloud opacity is to include an ad hoc opaque level at the pressure level in the atmosphere required to reproduce the observations , which represents an optically thick ( at all wavelengths ) cloud deck [ e.g.][]berta12 .",
    "benneke12 developed a bayesian retrieval method for super - earths which can incorporate this type of opaque level to represent a cloud . in a more sophisticated cloud treatment , howe12 incorporate a range of haze layers into gj 1214b atmospheres . in each of their models , they include a haze composed of polyacetylene , tholin , or sulfuric acid .",
    "they test a range of different ad hoc number densities , particle sizes , and pressure levels for each cloud material .",
    "they find that a hydrogen - rich atmosphere with a haze layer is generally consistent with the observations , but can not rule out a water - rich atmosphere .",
    "their result serves as a useful parameter study , demonstrating that clouds within a hydrogen - rich atmosphere can match the observations .",

    "]      previous cloud studies of gj 1214b have invoked clouds as a way of matching the transmission spectrum observations , but these studies all lack a physical basis for choosing the cloud - forming material , the amount of cloud material , and the distribution of the cloud in the atmosphere ; that is , a cloud layer could match observations , but no chemistry models were used to determine where clouds form and from what materials . while these studies do find that clouds can reproduce the observations , a remaining essential question is how plausible these clouds are given the conditions in the planet s atmosphere . in this study , we include two sets of physically - motivated clouds  based on two types of chemistry models  that are expected to form in the planet s atmosphere kempton12 , and explore their effects in detail .",
    "the first set of clouds are those that form as a result of equilibrium chemistry .",
    "equilibrium clouds have been extensively studied in brown dwarfs ; silicate and iron clouds condense in l dwarfs [ e.g.][]tsuji96 , allard01,marley02,burrows06,cushing08 , visscher10 and sulfide and chloride clouds condense in t dwarfs lodders06 , visscher06 , morley12 .",
    "the other set of clouds we include form as a result of disequilibrium chemistry ; we include a photochemically - produced haze layer .",
    "we follow the photochemical destruction of ch@xmath21 and the corresponding creation of higher order hydrocarbons , with a photochemical model .",
    "although we do not follow the photochemical pathways completely to haze formation , the model is used to determine the abundance and vertical distribution of haze precursors .",
    "photochemical hazes form in the atmospheres of all of the solar system s giant planets [ e.g.][]gautier89 .",
    "while gj 1214b is significantly warmer than any of these planets , it is cool enough that methane is still the most abundant carbon - bearing species kempton12 . due to its large uv photodissociation cross section ,",
    "methane breaks apart in the upper atmosphere of irradiated planets and produces rich carbon chemistry in the atmosphere .",
    "models that include uv dissociation of methane find that molecules such as c@xmath14h@xmath14 , c@xmath14h@xmath21 , c@xmath14h@xmath22 , ch@xmath23 , hcn , and c@xmath22h@xmath22 exist in far greater abundance than would be expected from chemical equilibrium calculations yung84 , zahnle09 , moses11 , kempton12 .",
    "there are of course many ways to model clouds in planetary atmospheres marley13 , and because we approach the problem by extending the models which have been used mainly for brown dwarf science , we will briefly describe the differences between the approaches here . for a much more extensive comparison , helling08 review various cloud modeling techniques and compare model predictions for various cases .",
    "many modeling groups apply the general assumptions of equilibrium chemistry that we apply here [ e.g.][]tsuji96 , allard01,marley02,burrows06,cushing08 , visscher10 , though these models differ in the details of their approaches .",
    "a detailed comparison of true equilibrium condensation and cloud condensate removal from equilibrium can be found in fegley94 , lodders06 and references therein .    instead of assuming equilibrium chemistry to calculate cloud propertiers , helling & woitke helling06 follow tiny seed particles of tio@xmath14 in the upper atmospheres of brown dwarfs , which they assume to be advected from deeper layers , and follow the particles as sink downwards .",
    "as these seed particles fall through the atmosphere , they collect condensate material . in helling06 and numerous follow on papers helling08 , witte09 , witte11 , dekok11 this group models the microphysics of grain growth given these conditions .",
    "they predict ` dirty ' grains composed of layers of varying condensates .",
    "this model has been applied to self - luminous giant planets and brown dwarfs but has not yet been applied to transiting super - earths like gj 1214b .",
    "the only planets in a similar mass range to gj 1214b with well - characterized atmospheric compositions are uranus and neptune . both planet",
    "s atmospheres are @xmath16 50@xmath24 solar abundance in carbon , mostly in the form of methane fletcher10 .",
    "other elements can not easily be studied in those atmospheres because the planets are cold and most species are condensed into clouds below the visible atmosphere .    although it is well - established that planetary atmospheres in our own system have enhanced metallicities , the composition of exoplanet atmospheres is not yet well understood . in this analysis",
    ", we include solar composition models and 50@xmath24 solar metallicity ( [ m / h]=1.7 ) models .",
    "the enhanced metallicity models are enhanced uniformly in all heavy elements .          in gj 1214b s atmosphere , assuming thermochemical equilibrium",
    ", a variety of substances will condense in the upper atmosphere .",
    "figure [ pt - profile ] shows pressure  temperature ( _ p  t _ ) profiles of model atmospheres with hydrogen / helium rich compositions .",
    "the top panel shows solar composition models and condensation curves ; the bottom panel shows 50@xmath24 solar metallicity composition models .",
    "cloud - free models are shown as solid lines and cloudy models are shown as dashed lines .",
    "the models used to calculate these profiles are discussed in section [ atmmodel ] .",
    "the condensation curves , shown as colored dashed lines , show where each element or molecule condenses assuming chemical equilibrium ; the condensation curve represents the pressures and temperatures where the vapor pressure of a gas is equal to its saturation vapor pressure . to the left of the curve , we assume that vapor in excess of the saturation vapor pressure will form a condensate that settles toward the cloud base . in this approach , the cloud base forms where the _ p  t _ profile meets the condensation curve , with some vertical extent above that point .",
    "the iron and silicate clouds form extremely deep in the atmosphere , as they do on jupiter .",
    "na@xmath14s , zns , mns , cr , and kcl form higher in the atmosphere .",
    "the opacity of na@xmath14s , zns , mns , cr , and kcl clouds have recently been included in t dwarf atmospheres by morley12 , using the equilibrium condensation approach of visscher06 within the framework of the well - established am01 treatment for cloud formation and settling in l dwarf atmospheres .",
    "we use the methods developed and described in morley12 to include the same clouds in a super - earth atmosphere .",
    "the major differences between the morley12 models for brown dwarf atmospheres and the models here are the irradiation of the planet by the host star and the enhanced metallicity of the atmosphere for some models .",
    "morley12 published saturation vapor pressure and condensation curves for [ m / h]@xmath250.5 and @xmath260.5 . for this study , a higher metallicity ,",
    "[ m / h]@xmath27 , was necessary .",
    "we calculated the condensation temperature for kcl and zns based on a model gj 1214b _ p  t _ profile .",
    "we found that , for this particular model atmosphere , the saturation vapor pressure and condensation curves were very close to the values we would have found by extrapolating the morley12 vapor pressure and condensation curves .",
    "since the differences due to the extrapolation are small for the gases in question , we adopted the same curves in this study .    to flatten transmission spectrum features in the near - ir , the clouds must be present and optically thick at _ slant _ viewing geometry above @xmath1610@xmath28 bar . only kcl and zns form that high in the atmosphere for this planet ( see figure [ pt - profile ] ) , so for the models here , we include only the kcl and zns clouds .",
    "na@xmath14s  will also form , but generally too deep to become optically thick at the low pressure levels probed in transmission spectra .",
    "we assume that the kcl and zns form into homogeneous , spherical particles , unlike the heterogeneous compositions that have been favored by helling08b .",
    "the particle sizes and vertical thickness of the cloud are calculated using the parametrized value @xmath0  in the am01 framework .",
    "this value is equal to the ratio of the sedimentation velocity to the updraft velocity . a high sedimentation efficiency @xmath0  forms a cloud with large particles that settles into a thin layer ; a low @xmath0  forms a more extended cloud with smaller particles .",
    "the photochemistry model used to generate the properties of the hydrocarbon haze layer is described in detail in kempton12 . at the time of publication of kempton12",
    ", the uv spectrum of gj 1214 had not been observed ; instead , the study focused on two end - cases : a quiet m dwarf and an active m dwarf ( ad leo ) .",
    "recently , france13 published a uv spectrum of the gj 1214 host star .",
    "for the host star in the photochemistry model , we use this observed uv spectrum from 1150 to 3100   and a phoenix model atmosphere spectrum with a stellar effective temperature of 3026 k and a stellar radius of 0.211 @xmath29  from 3100 to 10000   hauschildt99 .",
    "we have calculated new solar metallicity and 50@xmath24 solar metallicity models with the new spectrum .",
    "figure [ photochem ] shows the results of the photochemistry calculations for the two values of the eddy diffusion coefficient used in this study : @xmath30= 10@xmath31 and 10@xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 .",
    "as described above , for the equilibrium clouds , our model parametrizes the cloud properties with a single value , @xmath0 ; this model inherently assumes that the condensation of particles can be described by an equation for saturation vapor pressure which is an analytic function of atmospheric temperature and pressure .",
    "the formation of a hydrocarbon haze layer by polymerization is more complex and can not be described simply and analytically in the same way as a function of temperature and pressure .",
    "the more complicated situation means that we can not use the single parameter @xmath0 , but instead must calculate based on the photochemistry the amount of haze in each layer , and explore how changing parameters like particle size affects the transmission spectrum .",

    "there is significantly more reducing material at the pressure levels where we form hazes , so we assume that higher - order hydrocarbons will continue to grow to potentially form condensed hydrocarbon soot - like particles . ,",
    "width=360 ]    the highest order hydrocarbons produced by the kempton12 and zahnle09 models are the second - order hydrocarbons acetylene ( c@xmath14h@xmath14 ) , ethylene ( c@xmath14h@xmath21 ) , and ethane ( c@xmath14h@xmath22 ) . higher - order hydrocarbon chemistry ( e.g. ,",
    "> c@xmath23h@xmath35 ) in reducing , high - temperature , low - pressure planetary environments like gj 1214b remains incompletely understood , and current photochemical and kinetics models ( which generally derive reaction rates from combustion studies under much more oxidizing conditions ) do not capture all possible chemical pathways for producing higher - order hydrocarbons that form soots in exoplanet atmospheres ( e.g. , see moses11 discussion on c@xmath23c@xmath22 chemistry ) .    because the hydrocarbon chemistry is truncated at c@xmath14h@xmath35 , polymerization beyond c@xmath14h@xmath35 is not included .",
    "when conditions favor polymerization carbon will instead pool in c@xmath14h@xmath35 species , because longer carbon chains are not allowed .",
    "we can estimate how favorable conditions are for polymerization by comparing the quantities of reducing and oxidizing species in the atmosphere .",
    "if there are more oxidizing species ( oh ) , oxidation by oh will inhibit hydrocarbon polymerization .",
    "if there are instead more reactive reducing species ( including c@xmath14h , c@xmath14h@xmath23 , ch , ch@xmath14 , ch@xmath23 , cn ) , then hydrocarbon polymerization is not inhibited and is expected to continue at some rate ( to date not well constrained by either experiments or kinetic theory ) .",
    "we calculate the amount of oxidizing and reducing material in each model atmosphere and determine that the amount of reducing material is larger ",
    "often many orders of magnitude larger  than the amount of oxidizing material at the pressure levels where soots are expected to form .",
    "each soot precursor will therefore react many times with these reducing radicals before interacting with an oh molecule , growing progressively larger until it become involatile enough to condense to form a solid soot - like haze particle .",
    "figure [ testphotochem ] shows an example of this comparison for a photochemistry model with 50@xmath24 solar composition and @xmath30=10@xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 .",
    "this is not unexpected in a cool atmosphere like gj 1214b s ( t@xmath36550 k ) with a relatively inactive host star ( see zahnle09 for more details ) .",
    "because of this propensity to polymerize , we assume that the second - order hydrocarbons c@xmath14h@xmath14 , c@xmath14h@xmath21 , and c@xmath14h@xmath22 and hcn in gj 1214b s atmosphere continuously polymerize to form complex hydrocarbons like soot .",
    "we further assume that this process happens with the same constant efficiency in each layer of the atmosphere .",
    "we treat this efficiency as a free parameter .",
    "hazes are thus most likely to form at altitudes where these soot precursors ( c@xmath14h@xmath14 , hcn ) are produced in abundance via photochemical and thermochemical processes .",
    "the soot precursors are most favored when ch@xmath21 is abundant , as is the case for gj 1214b , and will be enhanced further for high c / o ratios moses13 .      to determine the amount of material available to form hydrocarbon haze , we use the results from photochemistry models .",
    "these results give us the mixing ratio of each species at each pressure level in the atmosphere ( see figure [ photochem ] ) .",
    "we calculate the number density of each species at each height in our model and multiply by the mean molecular weight of each species to calculate the mass density of c@xmath14h@xmath14 , c@xmath14h@xmath21 , c@xmath14h@xmath22 , and hcn in each model layer .",
    "we sum the densities of these four species to find the total mass in soot precursors .",
    "a fraction of the total mass of soot precursors goes into forming the haze we model here : we multiply the total mass by our parametrized `` efficiency''that is , the fraction of haze precursors that actually form haze particles  to find the mass of the haze particles in a given layer . for each layer ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the prescribed efficiency , @xmath39 is the mass of material in each species within each model layer from the photochemical model , and @xmath40 is the calculated mass of haze particles in that layer .    from the total mass of haze particles in each layer , we calculate how many particles form .",
    "we choose a mode particle size and establish a log - normal particle distribution ; we calculate the number of particles by summing over the distribution for each of our chosen particle sizes .",
    "we base our particle size distribution and physical properties on those found in experiments of soots on earth .",
    "for example , kim99 finds that diesel soot particles can have mode particle sizes between 0.05 and 0.5  with a relatively log - normal distribution around the mode .",
    "we use an average material density from slowik04 of 2.0 g @xmath5 ; note that while soots often form as low - density fluffy aggregates on earth , we use the density only to calculate the number of particles formed , so the density of the solid soot material must be used .",
    "we use soot optical properties ( the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index ) tabulated in the software package opac ( optical properties of aerosols and clouds ) hess98 , which we linearly extrapolate for wavelengths longer than 40 .",
    "the extrapolation affects the spectrum negligibly between 40 and 230 .    when calculating the transmission spectrum , equilibrium chemistry abundances are used .",
    "kempton12 showed that the disequilibrium abundances of carbon and nitrogen species will change the calculated spectrum very slightly , but will not change the overall shape of the spectrum .",
    "the equilibrium cloud code is coupled to a 1d atmosphere model that calculates the pressure  temperature profile of an atmosphere in radiative  convective equilibrium .",
    "this methodology has been successfully applied to modeling solar system planets and moons , brown dwarfs , and exoplanets , with both cloudy and clear atmospheres ; the models are described in mckay89 , marley96 , burrows97 , mm99 , marley02 , fortney05 , saumon08 , fortney08b .",
    "the atmosphere model utilizes the radiative transfer techniques described in toon89 . within this method , it is possible to include mie scattering of particles as an opacity source in each layer .",
    "our opacity database for gases , described extensively in freedman08 , includes all the important absorbers in the atmosphere .",
    "this opacity database includes two significant updates since freedman08 , which are described in saumon12 : a new molecular line list for ammonia yurchenko11 and an improved treatment of collision induced h@xmath14 absorption richard12 .",
    "the equilibrium cloud model is coupled with the radiative transfer calculations and the pressure - temperature profile of the atmosphere ; this means that a converged model will have a temperature structure that is self - consistent with the clouds .",
    "figure [ pt - profile ] shows an example of how clouds change the _ p  t _ structure of an irradiated planet ; the deep atmosphere of a cloudy model ( dashed line ) is cooler than the corresponding cloud - free model ( solid line ) at a given pressure in the atmosphere .",
    "this cooling is due to the opacity of the cloud , which prevents the stellar flux from warming those deep layers of the atmosphere , the so - called anti - greenhouse effect .",
    "the photochemical output is calculated based on a converged cloud - free model , and so does not have this same self - consistency .",
    "the opacity of the cloud is included during the _ p  t _ structure calculation , ensuring that the atmosphere is in radiative  convective equilibrium , but a shift in the _ p  t _ profile does not change the location of the haze layer .",

    "examining the solar composition model spectra ( figure [ sulfspecsolar ] ) and data by eye , the features in the infrared are larger in the models than in the data , even for @xmath0@xmath1 clouds .",
    "this suggests that if gj 1214b does have a solar - metallicity atmosphere , these clouds alone are not likely to be fully obscuring the near - infrared spectrum .",

    "models with higher values of @xmath0  ( i.e. thinner clouds ) have features in the optical and infrared larger than the data show .",

    "figure [ sootspec1 ] illustrates the effect of changing the mean particle size on the transmission spectrum .",
    "each of the models shown has the same @xmath38 value ( 3% ) and uses the same photochemistry ( 50@xmath24 solar , @xmath30=10@xmath32",
    "@xmath33 s@xmath34 ) , so the mass of haze particles in each model is identical , isolating the effect of particle size .",
    "small particles are generally more optically thick because , given the same total haze mass , smaller particles have a higher number density . for the smallest particle sizes ( 0.01 @xmath12 m ) ,",
    "scattering by haze particles causes the transmission spectrum to rise into the optical . for larger particles , they scatter less efficiently at optical wavelengths . for particle sizes above @xmath160.25 @xmath12 m",
    ", the opacity of the haze particles is relatively gray for optical through near - infrared wavelength and the resulting spectrum is more flat .",
    "figure [ sootspec2 ] illustrates the effect of changing the fraction of haze precursors that actually form into haze particles ( defined here as @xmath38 , see equation [ fhaze - eq ] ) .",
    "the models shown each have the same photochemistry ( 50@xmath24 solar , @xmath30=10@xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 ) and particle sizes ( 0.05 ) to isolate the effect of changing the fraction of soot precursors that become haze particles .",
    "as expected , increasing @xmath38 increases the optical depth of the haze , obscuring the molecular features in the spectrum .",
    "figure [ sootspec3 ] shows how vertical mixing , parametrized as @xmath30  in the photochemistry models , affects the transmission spectra . the same metallicity ( 50@xmath24 solar ) , particle size (",
    "0.1 @xmath12 m ) and @xmath38 ( 3% ) are used , and @xmath30  is varied from 10@xmath3110@xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 . generally , we find that the eddy diffusion coefficient @xmath30  affects the haze - forming efficiency needed to reproduce the observations .",
    "the stronger the vertical mixing , the larger the quantity of soot precursors ( see also figure [ photochem ] ) .",
    "this means that models with @xmath30=10@xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 have more optically thick haze than @xmath30=10@xmath31 @xmath33 s@xmath34 ; if vertical mixing is more efficient , a lower fraction of soot precursors need to form into haze material to match the observations .",
    "figure [ sootspec4 ] shows the effect of metallicity on the model transmission spectra .",
    "unsurprisingly , we find that the 50@xmath24 solar metallicity models have significantly more soot precursors ( see figure [ photochem ] ) , as there are a factor of 50 more heavy elements in the atmosphere .",
    "this means that if the same fraction of soot precursors become haze particles , the high metallicity model will have more mass in haze and therefore a more optically thick atmosphere . indeed , we find that very few of the models at solar metallicity have an optically thick haze layer .              in general",
    ", we find a range of models with a hydrocarbon haze layer that can match most of the observations .",
    "the best - fitting models all have 50@xmath24 solar metallicity . for the less vigorous mixing ( @xmath30=10@xmath31 @xmath33 s@xmath34 ) , models with small particle sizes ( 0.01 to 0.1 ) and @xmath38 of 3 - 5%",

    "only a single model had a reasonably good fit ( @xmath45=3 ) , which had particle sizes of 0.25  and @xmath38=25% .",
    "this @xmath38 value represents a quarter of soot precursors forming into condensed haze solids , which seems quite high .",
    "these results generally suggest that if gj 1214b has an enhanced metallicity atmosphere like neptune , there is a large range of particle size distributions and photochemical efficiencies that can result in an obscuring haze in the atmosphere .      in a planetary atmosphere ,",
    "a number of different cloud and haze layers can form .",
    "for example , in titan s atmosphere , there is both a high photochemical hydrocarbon haze and a deeper methane cloud . to examine this for gj 1214b",
    ", we include both the equilibrium kcl and zns clouds and the hydrocarbon soot layer in a set of solar composition models , to see if by including both clouds we could match the spectrum without enhancing the metallicity of the atmosphere .",
    "we ran a small set of models with favorable equilibrium cloud parameters ( no heat redistribution to the night side , @xmath0=0.1 ) and hydrocarbon haze parameters ( @xmath38=5 - 10% , @xmath30=10@xmath32 @xmath33 s@xmath34 ) .",
    "however , none of these models fit the data as well as the enhanced - metallicity equilibrium cloud models , enhanced - metallicity hydrocarbon haze models , or a high mean molecular weight water - rich model .",
    "as discussed in section [ methods - eqclouds ] , the particle sizes and vertical thickness of the equilibrium kcl and zns clouds are calculated using the parametrized value @xmath0 , which is equal to the ratio of the sedimentation velocity to the updraft velocity . a high sedimentation efficiency @xmath0  forms a cloud with large particles that settles into a thin layer ; a low @xmath0  forms a more extended cloud with small particles .",
    "this model has been used most frequently for studies of brown dwarfs .",
    "studies of l dwarfs find that @xmath0@xmath1613 for the majority of field l dwarfs stephens09 , saumon08 .",
    "similarly , morley12 found that for sulfide clouds in t dwarfs , @xmath0@xmath1645 .    in this study , we find that the value needed to fit the observations is @xmath0@xmath1 , a sedimentation efficiency more than ten times lower than those of brown dwarfs",
    ". however , this low value may not be unreasonable for an irradiated planetary atmosphere . in am01 ,",
    "values of @xmath0  for earth clouds are calculated .",
    "they find that for clouds that form high in earth s atmosphere ",
    "stratocumulus clouds@xmath0  is less than 1 , with values for specific case studies ranging from 0.2 ( north sea ) to 0.30.5 ( california ) .",
    "the clouds we model in gj 1214b form within a nearly - isothermal radiative region of the atmosphere , so we expect them to behave more like earth stratocumulus clouds than the deeper tropospheric cumulus clouds , which have high @xmath0  ( 26 ) , more similar to brown dwarfs .    @xmath0  is the ratio of the sedimentation velocity to the updraft velocity which is equal to @xmath30@xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the mixing length .",
    "a low @xmath0  could be caused by many different things .",
    "( 1 ) if the cloud particles are fluffy aggregates , they would have a slow sedimentation velocity .",
    "( 2 ) if @xmath30  is large , like those of hot jupiters ( showman09 finds that hot jupiters have @xmath30@xmath50@xmath33 s@xmath34 ) , then the updraft velocity will be large .",
    "( 3 ) if the mixing length @xmath49 is small ( due to a mean molecular weight gradient or wave breaking effects ) , then the atmosphere will be stably stratified , and @xmath0  will be small .",
    "there is already clear observational evidence of a cloud layer very high in the atmosphere of hot jupiter hd 189733 pont08,sing11,pont12 .",
    "the spectral slope of the observations suggests opacity due to rayleigh scattering , which would be due to quite small ( sub - micron ) sized particles .",
    "the cloud layer obscures gaseous absorption features from the blue to the near infrared .",
    "based on its optical properties , the obscuring cloud layer has been suggested to be composed on small enstatite particles lecavelier08b , which would have to be kept aloft high in the planet s atmosphere due to inefficient sedimentation .",
    "gj 1214b s transmission spectrum is often described as ` flat ' or ` featureless , ' but in reality , its features are just too small to detect with current signal - to - noise observations . while we find that with current data , a hydrogen - helium rich model with clouds can fit just as well as a 100% water model , if we can improve the precision in the near - infrared , there are features that allow us to distinguish between these possibilities [ see also ] [ ] benneke12 .",
    "figure [ zoomspec ] shows how two sample cloudy models compare to a 100% water model .",
    "the hydrocarbon haze model is deliberately chosen to show the large extent to which the haze layer can obscure the near - infrared features and flatten the spectrum .",
    "one feature of cloudy spectra , absent in the 100% water spectrum , is that there are flat regions between features , especially at 0.9 , 1.1 , and 1.3 .",
    "this is the pressure level where the clouds become optically thick ; above this level , one can see gas opacity features , but all features below are obscured",
    ". a higher signal - to - noise spectrum in the near - infrared from 1 to 1.8  should be able to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "the spectra also look different in regions where additional species absorb more strongly than water vapor .",
    "for example , between 2.2 and 2.4  there is a strong methane band .",
    "( note that this part of the spectrum has particularly conflicting results to date ) .",
    "similarly , the feature at 1.7  is due to methane and the feature at 2.0  is due to co@xmath14 .",
    "these bands would be completely lacking in a pure water atmosphere . by resolving regions of the spectrum where additional absorbers",
    ", if they exist , dominate , we could differentiate between a pure water atmosphere and a hydrogen / helium - rich atmosphere with many absorbers including clouds .",
    "figure [ zoomspec20micron ] shows the same models as figure [ zoomspec ] , but for longer wavelengths ( 120 ) . for both cloudy models shown , because the cloud particles are relatively small they do not absorb as efficiently in the mid - infrared as they do in the near - infrared .",
    "the cloud opacity decreases significantly , and even in models with a thick obscuring haze layer in the near - infrared , the atmosphere becomes clear of haze at mid - infrared wavelengths .",
    "gaseous water and methane features dominate the transmission spectrum beyond 34 .",
    "promisingly , this suggests that even if many exoplanet atmospheres features are obscured in the wavelengths accessible from the ground or from _ hst _ , the wavelengths probed by the _ james webb space telescope _ will be less sensitive to haze obscuration .",
    "however , atmospheres with mixed h@xmath14o / h@xmath14-rich compositions can also fit the data ; berta12 finds that any atmosphere with a mass fraction of water higher than 70% can fit the observations .",
    "distinguishing a mixed atmosphere from a cloudy h@xmath14-rich atmosphere would be more challenging as features such as methane may also appear .",
    "the chemistry of such extremely high metallicity atmospheres is not currently well - understood and is a subject of ongoing study moses12b .",
    "this work , and that of zahnle09 and kempton12 , suggests that photochemistry could be extremely important for interpreting the spectra of cool exoplanets .",
    "we find that there is a large range of parameter space for a photochemical haze that can obscure the transmission spectrum of a hydrogen and helium dominated atmosphere . in this work , we parametrized the chemical processes expected to polymerize 2nd - order hydrocarbons . as part of our ongoing and future work",
    "we seek to identify and characterize the key chemical pathways expected to produce higher - order hydrocarbons in the upper atmospheres of irradiated exoplanets .",
    "the spectral signatures of photochemically - produced gases were not included in these spectra , but it has been suggested that these would have relatively small signatures kempton12 . detecting additional soot precursors like benzene rings , polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons , or other polymers with high - resolution spectroscopy would further constrain photochemical haze creation .",
    "recent work has shown that planets may have some range in carbon and oxygen abundances madhu11b , madhu11 , madhu12b , moses13 .",
    "in particular , moses13 studied the effect of c / o ratio on disequilibrium processes such as photochemistry and vertical mixing .",
    "they find that in atmospheres with a high c / o ratio , the abundances of soot precursors such as hcn and c@xmath14h@xmath14 are significantly enhanced .",
    "if gj 1214b did have a high c / o ratio , it may be even easier to form a layer of optically thick soot .",
    "previous work by howe12 has shown that by adding an ad - hoc haze layer , the observations of gj 1214b can be reproduced . here",
    ", we showed that two types of clouds that may naturally emerge from equilibrium or non - equilibrium chemistry considerations , in an enhanced - metallicity atmosphere , can reproduce the observations of gj 1214b .",
    "we presented results that show that clouds that form as a result of equilibrium chemistry , as they perhaps do on brown dwarfs , can reproduce the observations of gj 1214b if they are lofted high in the atmosphere and the sedimentation efficiency parameter @xmath0  is low ( 0.1 ) .",
    "this value is significantly different than the values of @xmath0@xmath1613 for l dwarfs or @xmath1645 for t dwarfs , but is potentially quite reasonable for high altitude clouds in an irradiated planet .",
    "we showed that models including hydrocarbon haze that forms as a result of photochemistry can also flatten gj 1214b s spectrum .",
    "we used a 1d photochemical kinetics model to calculate the vertical distribution and available mass of molecules that are produced on the pathway to haze formation . with haze - forming efficiencies between 1% and 5%",
    ", we found equally well - fitting models with modal particle sizes from 0.01 to 0.25 .",
    "we conclude that , while more work on understanding the chemical processes of forming hydrocarbons is necessary , it is very plausible that gj 1214b s spectrum is obscured by a layer of soot .",
    "although there are of course uncertainties in the detailed implementation of the cloud models , we stress that both kinds of clouds emerge naturally from either equilibrium chemistry or photochemical arguments .",
    "in particular , haze formation has the possibility to lead to the obscuration of gaseous absorption features over a wide range of planetary parameter space , from super - earths to giant planets , over a wide range in planetary temperature .",
