    "what is the origin of the smbhs that power the most distant quasars ?",
    "there are currently three main scenarios for the formation of the initial `` seed '' bhs from which these smbhs grew ( e.g. haiman 2009 , 2012 ; natarajan 2011 ; volonteri 2010 , 2012 ) : ( 1 ) massive population ( pop )  iii seeds , which form from the collapse of @xmath11@xmath12 primordial stars in dark matter ( dm ) minihalos with total masses of @xmath13@xmath14 at redshifts @xmath15 ( e.g. madau & rees 2001 ) ; ( 2 ) supermassive stellar remnant seeds , which form with initial masses of @xmath9@xmath16 from the direct collapse of @xmath1710@xmath18 k primordial gas in atomic cooling dm halos with total masses of @xmath410@xmath1910@xmath20 @xmath5 at @xmath7 @xmath210 ( e.g. bromm & loeb 2003 ) ; ( 3 ) and seeds formed from the collapse of @xmath410@xmath21 @xmath5 stars created in runaway collisions in dense stellar clusters at @xmath7 @xmath4 1020 ( e.g. devecchi & volonteri 2009 ; davies et al .",
    "2011 ) .    distinguishing between these three scenarios",
    "poses significant challenges , in large part because the high-@xmath7 regime in which these seed bhs are born is too distant to be probed directly by existing facilities .",
    "however , significant progress has been made in detecting @xmath22 smbhs powering quasars at @xmath23 , the existence of which provides significant constraints on the nature and growth of their bh seeds ( e.g. willott et al .",
    "2003 ; fan 2006 ) .",
    "the strongest constraints to date come from the @xmath24 smbh inferred to be powering a quasar at @xmath25 ( mortlock et al .",
    "2011 ) . given the @xmath26 myr available for the growth of such a massive bh , only the most optimistic models can explain their origin from @xmath4100 @xmath5 pop  iii seeds , suggesting that more massive seeds may have a role to play ( e.g. baumgarte & shapiro 1999 ; tyler et al .",
    "2003 ; shapiro 2005 ; volonteri & rees 2006 ; tanaka et al .",
    "2012 ) .",
    "also consistent with supermassive seeds are observations of high-@xmath7 quasars powered by smbhs that are very massive compared to the stellar component of their host galaxies ( e.g. wang et al . 2010 , 2013 ; willott et al .",
    "2013 ) , much more so than would be predicted following the observed relation in the local universe ( e.g. ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; gebhart et al .",
    "2000 ; but see van den bosch et al .",
    "2012 for a notable exception ) . as discussed by agarwal et al .",
    "( 2013 ) , such relatively massive bhs in early galaxies are easily accommodated in the sms seed model .    at the same time , a growing body of theoretical work is providing renewed support for the long - standing supermassive stellar remnant model ( e.g. fowler & hoyle 1964 ; appenzeller & fricke 1972 ; shapiro & teukolsky 1979 ; bond et al . 1984 ) .",
    "in particular , there are now strong suggestions that the conditions required for the formation of supermassive stars ( smss ) may be satisfied more often in the early universe than previously assumed ( wise et al .",

    "finally , we discuss the implications for the main models of seed formation in section 5 , and we summarize our results in section 6 .",
    "here we make a simple , but novel , argument for why the role of mergers in growing the most massive high-@xmath7 bhs must be limited , in part , due to global molecule - dissociating , lyman - werner radiative feedback .",
    "this will allow us to dramatically simplify our discussion of smbh growth in the early universe in later sections , by focusing solely on growth via gas accretion .",
    "many previous works have examined the possibility of smbhs growing from pop  iii seeds via mergers and gas accretion ( menou et al . 2001 ; haehnelt 2003 ; islam et al .",

    "2012 ) have reported that mergers of pop  iii remnant seeds born in dm halos with virial temperatures @xmath28 = 400 k enhance the final masses of smbhs by a factor of 10100 .",

    "2003 ; oshea & norman 2007 ) , even at the earliest epochs ( e.g. gao et al . 2007 ) , implies a decrease in the host halo abundance by a factor of 12 orders of magnitude ( as found from large - scale cosmological simulations of hierarchical structure formation ; e.g. reed et al .",
    "assuming the same star formation efficiency and pop  iii initial mass function from tanaka et al .",

    "this dramatically limits the masses to which bhs can grow from pop  iii seeds , in particular .    the rate of mergers that grow smbhs from pop  iii seeds is further reduced due to the build - up of the molecule - dissociating lyman - werner ( lw ) radiation field which acts to slow the collapse of primordial gas in dm halos , and thus lowers the pop  iii star formation rate ( sfr ) ( e.g. haiman et al .",

    "the most recent cosmological simulations tracking the build - up of the lw radiation field suggest that the pop  iii sfr is reduced by a factor of a few compared to the sfr in the absence of lw feedback ( ahn et al .",
    "2012 ; hummel et al . 2012",
    "; johnson et al . 2012a ; wise et al .",
    "accounting for this further reduction in the number density of pop  iii seed bhs , beyond the reduction due to the more massive host halos , we can conclude that mergers are likely to be responsible for only a small portion of the growth of smbhs .",
    "the vast majority of the growth must be due instead to accretion of gas ( see also , e.g. , hopkins & quataert 2010 ) and perhaps to a much lesser extent dm ( e.g. hu et al .",
    "2006 , guzm ' an & lora - clavijo 2011 ) .",
    "this justifies our simplified approach in later sections of focusing on the growth of bhs solely from accretion and neglecting mergers . in turn , as we will show in the next sections , the limited role of mergers in early smbh growth implies a strong challenge to the pop  iii seed model , which relies on frequent mergers to grow the most massive bhs .    a lower rate of ( gas poor ) mergers of seed bhs also suggests higher values for the spins of the seeds ( e.g. gammie et al .",
    "2004 ; volonteri et al .",
    "2005 , 2012 ; berti & volonteri 2008 ) , since mergers of bhs with randomly oriented spins will tend to spin down fast rotating bhs ( e.g. hughes & blandford 2003 ) .",
    "this translates into a higher radiative efficiency of accretion , since more energy can be extracted from the spin of the bh ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) and from the hotter accretion disk that extends further inward towards the horizon of a faster - spinning bh ( e.g. novikov & thorne 1973 ) .",

    "that we find mergers to be relatively unimportant is then broadly consistent with the inferred high radiative efficiencies of high-@xmath7 smbhs , which we shall discuss in section 4 .",
    "we now turn to highlight the observational constraints on the accretion history of high-@xmath7 smbhs that can be derived from the evolution of the comoving number density of smbhs over cosmic time . in particular , we place constraints on the time - averaged accretion rates and on the efficiency with which radiation is produced during accretion , as described below .    in general , the radiative luminosity , @xmath32 , of a black hole accreting at a rate @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is the speed of light and @xmath1 is the radiative efficiency , defined as the fraction of the rest mass energy of infalling matter that is converted into radiation during accretion . ) of the rest mass of the accreting material is finally accreted by the bh , as seen by an observer at infinity ( e.g. salpeter 1964 ; thorne 1974 ) .",

    "thus , the radiative feedback from pop  iii progenitor stars can significantly slow down the growth of pop  iii seeds to smbhs .    while radiative feedback from both accretion and the progenitor star are likely to limit @xmath33 to sub - eddington values at early times",
    ", we note that smbh - powered quasars at @xmath7 @xmath4 6 are inferred to have eddington ratios ( @xmath36 ) near unity .",
    "their duty cycles ( @xmath47 ) , however , are not well - constrained ( willott et al . 2010 ; see also shankar et al .",
    "2010 ) , although they are likely to be larger than those inferred for smbhs at lower redshifts ( e.g. trakhtenbrot et al . 2011 ) .",
    "overall , however , we conclude that radiative feedback , at least at the earliest times , appears likely to keep the time - averaged accretion rate of pop  iii remnant seeds at @xmath36@xmath47 @xmath75 1 .",
    "accretion - generated radiative feedback may also limit the growth of sms remnant bh seeds to sub - eddington rates ( e.g. johnson et al .",
    "however , as the intense ionizing radiation emitted by rapidly growing smss can not escape their heavy accretion flows , their host halos are less likely to be photoevaporated ( johnson et al . 2012b ; see also hosokawa et al .",
    "2012 ) ; in turn , the bh remnants they leave behind are likely to accrete more rapidly than pop  iii remnant seeds .",
    "we note that this is in basic agreement with the suggestion by salvaterra et al .",
    "( 2012 ) that more massive seed bhs accrete with higher eddington fractions than do lower mass seeds .",
    "in the previous sections we have highlighted the constraints that observations of high-@xmath7 quasars place on the nature of the bh seeds and subsequent growth of smbhs in the early universe , and we have reviewed the ways in which radiative feedback from stars and accreting bhs is expected to limit the growth of these objects .",
    "we now discuss the implications of these findings for the main models of smbh seed formation .    in sections 2 and 3 we showed that mergers of bh seeds are likely to play only a minor role in growing smbhs , and that the rate of accretion required to grow the observed smbhs depends only weakly on their number density ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "thus , we are justified in taking the simplified approach of solving equation ( 2 ) for the initial seed mass @xmath46 as a function of @xmath1 , @xmath36 , and @xmath47 , without regard for the role of mergers or for the precise redshift of formation of the seeds .",
    "figure 2 shows the minimum bh seed mass , @xmath46 , required to grow a smbh to a mass of @xmath78 by redshift @xmath7 , with the three panels corresponding to the scenarios shown in the panels in fig .  1 .",
    "in each panel , the minimum bh seed mass is shown for two choices of the time - averaged eddington fraction ( @xmath36@xmath74 = 0.5 and 1 ) and for the same three radiative efficiencies highlighted in fig .  1 ( @xmath1 = 0.07 , 0.1 , and 0.15 ) .",
    "for each of these cases we have assumed a value of @xmath54 corresponding to a space density of smbhs of @xmath79 ( comoving ) , but as fig .",
    "1 shows the results are not strongly sensitive to this choice .",
    "= 8.6 cm    the top two panels differ by very little , which is a reflection of the fact that the time between the formation of the first 10@xmath27 @xmath5 halo and that of the first 10@xmath19 @xmath5 halo in a 1 gpc@xmath21 comoving cosmological volume is small compared to the time from their formation to redshift @xmath7 ( on the horizontal axis ) .",
    "the values of @xmath46 shown in the bottom panel , however , are somewhat higher , reflecting the fact that the 100 myr delay assumed in this case is longer than the time between the formation of the first 10@xmath27 and 10@xmath19 @xmath5 halos . in every case , it is clear that high radiative efficiencies ( @xmath800.15 ) , such as those inferred from observations of high-@xmath7 smbhs ( see section 4.1 ) , imply seed masses for observed smbhs at @xmath0 of @xmath46 @xmath2 10@xmath2110@xmath27 @xmath5 , assuming constant eddington - limited accretion ( @xmath37@xmath47 = 1 ) . for lower time - averaged accretion rates , as suggested by simulations of bh accretion ( see section 4.2 ) , the implied minimum seed masses are much higher , up to @xmath81 for @xmath82 over the same range of radiative efficiencies .",
    "if accretion is radiatively efficient and the time - averaged accretion rate is sub - eddington , as discussed in section  4 , then the initial seed masses of the highest redshift smbhs must have been very high , perhaps exceeding even the range predicted by the sms remnant model ( 10@xmath1810@xmath83 @xmath5 ) in order to explain the 2 @xmath39 10@xmath57 @xmath5 bh reported at @xmath7 @xmath17 7 ( mortlock et al .",
    "interestingly , this is also consistent with the results of recent large - scale cosmological simulations tracking smbh growth which suggest that such high-@xmath7 quasars can be explained by starting with initial seed bh masses of 10@xmath27 @xmath5 ( li et al .",
    "2007 ; di matteo et al . 2012 ) . taken together ,",
    "we conclude that the available theoretical and observational evidence strongly suggests that the seeds of smbhs at high-@xmath7 were likely very massive . in turn , as the sms remnant model produces the most massive seeds of the three main models discussed in the introduction , the evidence suggests that this model may be the most viable ( see also e.g. natarajan & volonteri 2012 ) .",
    "100 @xmath5 ) pop  iii seed model is the weakest , the ( @xmath4 10@xmath21 @xmath5 ) stellar cluster seed model is somewhat more favorable , and the ( 10@xmath1810@xmath83 @xmath5 ) sms seed model is the strongest . ]",
    "one of the arguments against the sms remnant model has been that smss are exotic objects , and they may never form in our universe . a growing body of work is elucidating the conditions required for these objects to form ( e.g. bromm & loeb 2003 ; koushiappas et al . 2004 ; lodato & natarajan 2006 ; begelman et al .",

    "2010 ; ball et al . 2011 ; wolcott - green et al . 2011",
    "; see also mayer et al .",
    "2010 on massive seed formation from metal - enriched gas ) , 10@xmath84 m@xmath58 halos , which would form much later than the 10@xmath19 m@xmath58 halos we have focused on here .",
    "as this leaves far less time for their growth to 10@xmath57 m@xmath58 , it is unlikely that these can be the seeds of the highest-@xmath7 smbhs . ] and there are suggestions that the conditions for sms formation may occur much more often in the early universe than previously assumed ( dijkstra et al .",
    "2008 ; agarwal et al .",
    "2012 ; johnson et al . 2012a ; petri et al .",
    "2012 ) . indeed , agarwal et al .",
    "( 2012 ) find that , due to locally high lw fluxes generated by pop  ii stars in the early universe , a sufficient number of smss may form to provide the seeds for a large fraction of the smbhs in the centers of galaxies today ( see also greene 2012 ) .",
    "this development offers a completely independent reason to seriously consider sms remnants .    while the sms remnant model offers an explanation for the origins of the earliest smbhs that is consistent with the available data , we note that other models starting with lower initial seed masses can , in principle , also explain the data .",
    "for instance , as shown in fig .  2 , if @xmath46 @xmath4 10@xmath65 @xmath5 seeds accrete gas with very low radiative efficiency ( @xmath1 @xmath6 0.09 ) continuously at the eddington rate or , perhaps intermittently , above it ( e.g. jaroszynski et al .",
    "1980 ; collin et al . 2002 ; kawaguchi et al . 2004",
    "; ohsuga et al . 2005 ; volonteri & rees 2005 ; kurosawa & proga 2009 ; wyithe & loeb 2011 ; begelman 2012a ; li 2012 ) then , even allowing for a @xmath4 100 myr delay due to radiative feedback ( bottom panel ) , they could grow to @xmath2 10@xmath57 @xmath5 by @xmath7 @xmath2 7 .",
    "10@xmath18 m@xmath58 halos , which would have formed at earlier cosmological times . if this result is confirmed , it would suggest somewhat reduced constraints on the pop  iii seed model for smbh formation .",
    "] however , it is possible that a large fraction of the mass in such super - eddington flows is lost to a wind instead of being accreted onto the bh ( see e.g. begelman 2012b ; dotan & shaviv 2011 ) .",
    "it also remains to be demonstrated that these conditions are likely to be realized at @xmath7 @xmath2 7 . to the contrary",
    ", the available observational evidence suggests high radiative efficiencies ( e.g. @xmath1 0.10.15 or higher ; see section 4.1 ) and the available theoretical modeling suggests sub - eddington accretion ( see section 4.2 ) ; as we have discussed here , the sms seed model can explain the presence of the highest-@xmath7 smbhs , even given such high radiative efficiencies and limited accretion rates , while the pop  iii seed model can not .",
    "it is difficult to verify the sms remnant model without direct observational evidence of the existence of smss .",
    "we note , however , that there are observational signatures of smss that may be detected by future missions such as the _ james webb space telescope _",
    "( e.g. johnson et al .",
    "they may also leave unique chemical signatures that could be detected in lyman - limit systems ( woosley 1977 ; fuller & shi 1997 ) .",
    "in addition , upon their collapse smss are predicted to emit a large neutrino flux that could be detectable ( by e.g. _ icecube _ ) ( shi & fuller 1998 ; linke et al .",
    "2001 ; fryer & heger 2011 ; montero et al . 2012 ) , as well as to produce gravitational wave signatures that could be uncovered by the _",
    "laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory _  ( e.g. fryer & new 2011 ) , and extremely bright supernovae ( e.g. fuller et al . 1986 ) that could be found by the _ wide - field infrared survey telescope _ ( e.g. whalen et al . 2012 ) . in lieu of such observations ,",
    "the best evidence for the existence of smss remains the smbhs to which their remnants may have grown at the highest redshifts .",
    "in closing , we provide a summary of our new results and conclusions :    * with proper accounting for the masses of the halos in which pop  iii stars form at high redshift , as well as for the suppression of the pop  iii star formation rate due to the build - up of the lw background radiation field , we conclude that mergers played a limited role in the growth of pop  iii seed bhs ( see section 2 ) . *",
    "because the time available for the growth of seed bhs to the @xmath2 10@xmath57 @xmath5 smbhs observed at high redshift is only weakly dependent on the number density @xmath55 of these objects , we can safely assume that all such smbhs have roughly the same amount of time to grow by a given redshift ( see section 3 ) .",
    "this allows us to estimate the minimum initial seed mass required to grow them , as a function of just the radiative efficiency @xmath1 and the time - averaged fraction of the eddington rate at which they accrete , @xmath85@xmath47 . * using the most recent cosmological parameters ( from _ wmap7 _ )",
    ", we have shown that the highest - redshift smbhs known can only be explained by the eddington - limited growth of seed bhs with masses of @xmath46 @xmath4 100 @xmath5 ( pop  iii seeds ) and @xmath4 10@xmath27 @xmath5 ( sms seeds ) , if the radiative efficiency of accretion is @xmath1 @xmath6 0.09 and @xmath6 0.14 , respectively ( see section 3 ) . accounting for the likely suppression of accretion at early times , due to radiative feedback from the bh seed progenitor stars and from accretion onto the seeds themselves , leads to even tighter constraints on the pop  iii seed model ( see section 4.2 ) . * in turn , the high radiative efficiencies that are estimated for the highest - redshift and most massive smbhs ( @xmath1 @xmath2 0.10.15 ; see section 4.1 ) are much more easily accommodated in the sms seed model than in the pop  iii seed model , given the much larger initial seed masses expected in the former ( see section 5 ) .",
    "this is especially true if the time - averaged accretion rates of seed bhs are sub - eddington , as suggested by much recent theoretical work ( see section 4.2 ) .",

    "<S> recent observations of quasars powered by supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) out to @xmath0 constrain both the initial seed masses and the growth of the most massive black holes ( bhs ) in the early universe . here </S>",
    "<S> we elucidate the implications of the radiative feedback from early generations of stars and from bh accretion for popular models for the formation and growth of seed bhs . </S>",
    "<S> we show that by properly accounting for ( 1 ) the limited role of mergers in growing seed bhs as inferred from cosmological simulations of early star formation and radiative feedback , ( 2 ) the sub - eddington accretion rates of bhs expected at the earliest times , and ( 3 ) the large radiative efficiencies @xmath1 of the most massive bhs inferred from observations of active galactic nuclei at high redshift ( @xmath1 @xmath2 0.1 ) , we are led to the conclusion that the initial bh seeds may have been as massive as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this presents a strong challenge to the population iii seed model , which calls for seed masses of @xmath4 100 @xmath5 and , even with constant eddington - limited accretion , requires @xmath1 @xmath6 0.09 to explain the highest-@xmath7 smbhs in today s standard @xmath8cdm cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> it is , however , consistent with the prediction of the direct collapse scenario of smbh seed formation , in which a supermassive primordial star forms in a region of the universe with a high molecule - dissociating background radiation field , and collapses directly into a @xmath9@xmath10 @xmath5 seed bh . </S>",
    "<S> these results corroborate recent cosmological simulations and observational campaigns which suggest that these massive bhs were the seeds of a large fraction of the smbhs residing in the centers of galaxies today . </S>"
