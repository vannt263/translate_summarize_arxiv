    "planets are formed from protoplanetary disks surrounding young stars and are thought to migrate from their birthplaces into their final orbits .",
    "planet - disk interactions tend to dominate the orbital evolution of a planet until the circumstellar disk dissipates after a few myr .",
    "these interactions occur mainly through the exchange of angular momentum and energy around resonances which occur at locations where the natural frequencies of the disk material can be excited by the periodic potential of the planetary perturber @xcite .",
    "spiral density waves are launched at lindblad resonances , located where the radial epicyclic frequency , @xmath0 , matches the frequency of the perturbing potential felt by the disk material .",
    "waves launched from the inner lindblad resonances tend to drive outward migration of the planet , while waves launched from the outer lindblad resonances tend to drive inward migration of the planet @xcite . for small planets within typical protoplanetary disks",
    "the outer lindblad torque dominates over the inner lindblad torque , and the net differential lindblad torque drives planet migration inwards , towards the star @xcite , though wave reflection may alter the relative strength of the torques near a reflecting edge @xcite .    for circular orbits ,",
    "the corotation resonance  where the perturbation frequency matches the orbital frequency of the disk material  occurs at the orbital radius of the planet . for eccentric orbits ,",
    "non co - orbital corotation resonances can occur both interior and exterior to the planet s semi - major axis .",
    "these resonances also exchange energy and angular momentum with the planet .",
    "the sign of this exchange depends crucially on the disk parameters at the corotation point . in barotropic disks",
    "the sign of the corotation torque depends on the gradient of the vortensity , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the vorticity of the disk , and @xmath3 is the disk surface density .",
    "this can be understood in a qualitative fashion by considering the effect of the perturbing potential on collisionless particles @xcite .    in barotropic disks",
    "the vortensity is conserved along streamlines .",
    "material that is slightly outside the corotation point tends to be pushed inwards by the planet s potential , losing angular momentum , while the material slightly inside the corotation tends to be pushed outwards , gaining angular momentum .",
    "the corotation torque depends on the relative difference between these two effects , which is determined by preserving the net vortensity at corotation , and thus depends on the value of the vortensity _ gradient _ at the resonance .",
    "many previous simulations of disk torques have utilized a locally isothermal equation of state , and ignore the entropy equation ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in realistic disks , the barotropic assumption , that pressure depends only on density ,",
    "does not necessarily hold . in such non - barotropic disks ,",
    "vortensity is no longer conserved along streamlines , and can be modified by a baroclinic term ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which arises due to entropy gradients .",
    "this baroclinicity also modifies the corotation torque , as it changes the relative difference in the sign of the angular momentum transferred to the disk material in order to preserve the vortensity at the corotation ( for a more thorough discussion see section 2 of * ? ? ?",
    "previous works on the effect of non - barotropic equations of state on the corotation @xcite have primarily utilized numerical techniques to study the co - orbital corotation torques . while these works also consider the linear corotation torque , much more emphasis is appropriately placed on the role of non - linear horseshoe torques that dominate the co - orbital region .",
    "these non - linear horseshoe torques dominate the migration of small embedded planets , and for typical parameters , the co - orbital corotation torque was found to remain linear only for the order of a libration time @xcite before becoming non - linear , unless diffusivity and viscosity are sufficiently high .",
    "detailed simulations have also been performed ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) including these effects for small planets in type i migration , showing that indeed the effect of entropy gradients on the co - orbital corotation torques can halt or even reverse the migration of embedded planets .",
    "for planets with small eccentricity , however , the non co - orbital corotation torques are not as likely to become non - linear , as they are located further from planet , and result from potential components that scale linearly with the eccentricity .    in the barotropic limit",

    "i analytically compute the enthalpy perturbation at corotation due to a planetary perturber , and in section 5 , use this result to compute a fully analytic expression for the non - barotropic corotation torque .",
    "i then discuss the effects of thermal saturation in section 6 and calculate the necessary thermal diffusivity to maintain linearity .",
    "finally i will summarize the results of this paper in section 7 .    in a companion paper to this work , @xcite , we discuss the effect of non - barotropic corotation torques on the eccentricity evolution for giant planets that can clear a gap in the disk . utilizing results of the calculations in this paper",
    "we show that stellar insolation of the gap @xcite can result in entropy gradients and eccentricity excitation of giant planets , rather than the damping expected for a barotropic disk .",
    "we also suggest that the recently discovered `` eccentricity valley '' for low - metallicity exoplanetary systems @xcite may be a signature of this effect .",

    "these key quantities can also be expressed in terms of the entropy @xmath162 and the adiabatic index @xmath163 for particular equations of state . in taking the perturbations to be adiabatic",
    "we have implicitly assumed that the characteristic timescale for energy transport in the disk is slower than the perturbation ( orbital ) timescale , as is the case for radiatively inefficient disks .",
    "the expression for the corotation torque in equation above should be applicable to both keplerian disks , where the pressure gradients are negligible , and to disks that are significantly non - keplerian , due to either the effects of general relativity , or strong pressure gradients ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "we note that for truly sharp density or pressure transitions , such as gaps that have edge transitions of order less than the scale height , fully 3-d calculations should be used , such as in @xcite .    in @xcite , a companion paper to this work ,",
    "we utilize the cold disk limit of the results above to explore the effect of stellar illumination on gap opened by a giant planet .",
    "we show that disk entropy gradients are sufficiently modified in many cases to allow eccentricity excitation of the planets to occur by reducing the effectiveness of the eccentricity damping corotation resonances .",
    "we also suggest that a signature of this process may be evident in the deficit of low - metallicity eccentric planets in the `` eccentricity valley '' , between @xmath164 and @xmath165au from their host stars @xcite , as this corresponds to the region that would be shadowed by an inflated dust rim in a low metallicity disk @xcite .",
    "this research was supported by funding from the lorne trottier chair in astrophysics and cosmology , and the canadian institute for advanced research .",
    "i would like to thank andrew cumming , kostas gourgouliatos , neal turner , dong lai , peter goldreich and francois foucart for helpful advice and useful discussions during the course of this work .",
    "above we have stated that we can approximate @xmath166 , for @xmath111 only fairly small .",
    "this is not immediately obvious as formally when @xmath167 , @xmath168 , however it does so only logarithmically slowly , thus only a small imaginary component is sufficient to prevent significant variation from @xmath169 .",
    "this can be seen by first expressing the whittaker function in terms of the kummer function @xmath170 @xcite , _ , ( z ) = e^z/2 z^ + m(+- , 1 + 2 , z ) + e^z/2 z^ - m(-- , 1 + 2 , z ) . as @xmath171 , @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "we also have that @xmath174 , and thus the second term above dominates as @xmath109 .",
    "taking @xmath120 we have , _ 0 w _ , ( i ) = e^i/2 + i ( - ) /2 ^- . [ wnearzero ] as @xmath175 , @xmath176 = \\pi(\\tfrac{1}{2 } - \\mu)/2 + \\epsilon/2 $ ] , while |w_,(i)| = ^ - .",
    "thus for small @xmath111 we find , expanding in terms of @xmath177 , |w _ , ( i)| = ( 1 + 2_e + ( 1- ) + ) + o [ ( - ) ^2 ] . where @xmath178 is the euler - mascheroni constant , and @xmath179 is the digamma function . defining @xmath180 to be the fractional error we have from taking @xmath181 , we then find that the imaginary component , @xmath111 , required to have @xmath182 or less fractional error is given by - - 2_e - ( 1 - ) + o [ - ] , therefore the minimum @xmath111 required to assume @xmath183 scales exponentially as @xmath184 $ ] , such that only @xmath185 is required to have fractional error @xmath186 , with @xmath187 and @xmath188 ."
