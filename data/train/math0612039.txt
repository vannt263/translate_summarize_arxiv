    "many of the open questions concern periodic billiard orbits .",
    "these orbits correspond to closed , inscribed polygons @xmath5 that have the following property : at every corner of @xmath6 the two angles between @xmath6 and @xmath2 are equal .",

    "a classical example is the round disc : rotating harmonic polygons , we obtain one - parameter families of periodic orbits of the same kind .",
    "the property of having continuous families of periodic orbits holds for an arbitrary ellipse ; there are other examples of billiard tables with this property .",
    "however , all of these examples yield only one - parameter periodic families .",
    "the question arises if there exists a billiard table with a two - parameter periodic family .",
    "in such a table we could shoot the billiard ball , varying independently the initial position and the initial direction , and it would keep returning to the same position and direction . the intuition says that no billiard table has the magic property .",

    "what follows i will refer to it as the _ measure of periodic points conjecture _ , or simply the _ periodic points conjecture_. the conjecture and its variants figure prominently in the dynamics literature @xcite , and in the analysis literature @xcite . a few partial results towards the conjecture have been obtained , and i will comment on them below .    in this work",
    "i announce a positive solution of the measure of periodic points conjecture for planar billiard tables .",
    "more precisely , the theorem says that if @xmath0 is a compact , piecewise @xmath1 domain , then the measure of the set of periodic orbits for the billiard in @xmath2 is zero .",

    ". a complete version will appear elsewhere .    from here on , @xmath2 is a planar domain , unless explicitly stated otherwise .",
    "i will comment now on the variants of the conjecture that are in the literature .",
    "the billiard dynamics in @xmath2 has two realisations : as the billiard flow , and as the billiard map .",
    "the phase space of the billiard flow is three - dimensional .",
    "phase points are the pairs ( position , velocity ) where the position can be anywhere in @xmath2 .",
    "the billiard map is the poincare map with respect to the cross - section that consists of phase points where the position is in @xmath4 .",
    "this cross - section is the phase space of the billiard map .",
    "the liouville measure is invariant for the flow , and induces the canonical measure for the map .",
    "the flow version and the map version of the periodic points conjecture are equivalent . in what follows we will work only with the billiard map .",

    "the set @xmath20 of periodic points is a countable union of the sets of @xmath21-periodic points , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 .",
    "a seemingly different variant of the conjecture says that for every @xmath21 the set @xmath24 is nowhere dense .",
    "this claim is formally weaker than the equation @xmath25 ; it turns out , however , that the two statements are equivalent .",
    "see sections  [ main ] ,  [ crit ] .",
    "there are three kinds of partial results towards the periodic points conjecture .",
    "first , there are results that establish the claim under additional assumptions on the billiard table ; e. g. , assuming the ( piecewise ) real analyticity of @xmath4 @xcite .",
    "it is worth pointing out that in this case the claim is obvious : if the derivative of a real analytic function vanishes on an open set , then the function is constant .",
    "thus , if a real analytic billiard table @xmath2 has an open set of @xmath21-periodic orbits , then the @xmath21th iterate of the billiard map for @xmath2 is the identity map , which is absurd .",
    "results of the second kind prove the claim for generic ( smooth ) billiard tables @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that having continuous families of periodic orbits is a non - generic property .",
    "in fact , for the generic domain @xmath7 the sets @xmath22 are finite @xcite . hence , generically , @xmath26 .    since @xmath27 , establishing the periodic points conjecture amounts to proving the claim for every @xmath21 .",
    "partial results of the third kind do this for small @xmath21 .",
    "since @xmath28-periodic points are contained in the set of phase points orthogonal to @xmath29 , the smallest period for which the claim is not obvious is @xmath30 . in @xcite",
