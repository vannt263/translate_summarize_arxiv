    "predictions of inflation seem to be in agreement with the cmb data @xcite .",
    "it is usually assumed that _",
    "inflaton _ is an elementary scalar field .",
    "based on this assumption and field evolves slowly , inflation predicts : ( i ) the power spectrum of the density fluctuations is almost scale invariant and has no running .",
    "( ii ) tensor to scalar ratio @xmath0 where @xmath1 is slow - roll parameter .",
    "it has been argued that such a relation , if observationally verified , would offer strong support for the idea of inflation .    in this talk",
    ", we critically analyze this claim by considering a model in which the inflation is not an elementary field .",
    "more precisely , we ask the following question : if the inflaton is not an elementary field , how robust are these predictions ? it is long known that the role played by inflaton can also be played by the curvature scalar @xmath2 or logarithm of the radius of compactified space or vector meson condensate or a fermionic condensate .",
    "although there has been intense activity in several of these cases recently @xcite , the possibility of fermionic condensate has not been discussed much in the literature @xcite .",
    "we show that a spinor condensate is a viable alternative model for scalar driven inflation . in frw space - time",
    ", the spinor condensate has identical acceleration equation while the friedman equation is modified .",
    "we show that tensor and scalar spectra have running and satisfy different consistency relations .",
    "recently , the field theory for the eigen spinors of charge conjugation operator ( majorana spinors ) were constructed by ahluwalia - khalilova and grumiller @xcite and referred them as elkos .",
    "they showed that these new spinors possess special properties under discrete symmetries like charge @xmath3 , parity @xmath4 and time @xmath5 operators .",
    "more precisely , they showed that @xmath6 = 0 , ( { \\cal c}{\\cal p } { \\cal t})^2 = -1 $ ] .",
    "the mass dimensions of these spinors is 1 and the elkos ( @xmath7 ) lagrangian is : [ eq : elkolag ] _",
    "elko=  [ g^ ( _ _ + _ _ ) ] - v ( ) . where @xmath7 is the dual and @xmath8 is the covariant derivative @xcite .",
    "elkos have mass dimension one , hence , the only power counting renormalizable interactions of elkos with standard matter particle take place through higgs doublet or gravity @xcite .",
    "elkos are dark matter candidates @xcite and are also refereed as dark spinors .",
    "in the case of homogeneous - isotropic frw background , the einstein equations demand that @xmath9 and @xmath10 should depend on single scalar function @xcite @xmath11 where @xmath12 are constant column and row vectors , respectively .",
    "the acceleration and friedman equations are then given by : [ eq : eacceleration ] & & h = [a^2 ( ) v ( ) - ^2 ( ) ] + [ eq : efriedmann ] & & ^2 =  [ ] = the following points are worth noting regarding the above results : ( i ) the background elko ( and its dual ) depend on a single scalar function @xmath13 satisfying @xmath14 .",
    "this can be interpreted as an elko - pair forming a scalar condensate  spinflaton .",
    "( ii ) the acceleration equation for the spinflaton ( [ eq : eacceleration ] ) is identical to canonical scalar field inflation .",
    "however , the friedmann ( [ eq : efriedmann ] ) equations have non - trivial corrections due to elko .",
    "the elko modification to the canonical inflaton equations are determined by @xmath15 .",
    "( iii ) the form of the potential and the evolution of the field is completely different compared to the canonical scalar field .",
    "let us consider linear perturbation of frw background in the longitudinal gauge @xcite .",
    "as in standard inflation , the tensor perturbations do not couple to the energy density and pressure inhomogeneities and they are free gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "however , the scalar perturbations are harder to derive ; unlike the scalar field , elkos are described by four complex functions which are related by constraints .",
    "the most general perturbed elko can lead to the scalar and vector perturbations . besides , it can also lead to a non - vanishing anisotropic stress . for simplicity , we will assume that the anisotropic stress is identically zero .",
    "perturbation of a spinor has long been studied in spherically symmetric skyrmion model using the hedgehog ansatz @xcite .",
    "we use the similar procedure for the perturbed elko and its dual in the case of perturbation theory @xcite . as in the canonical scalar field",
    ", the perturbation equations can be combined in to a single equation in - terms of modified mukhanov - sasaki variable , i. e. , [ eq : msequation ] & & q",
    " - [^2 + -  + + ] q 0 + & & q = a + z ;   z = ( a )/  ;   _ = and @xmath16 is the slow - roll parameter . invoking the slow - roll conditions ( @xmath17 ) in the scalar ( [ eq : msequation ] ) and tensor perturbation equations  and following the standard quantization procedure  the scalar and tensor power spectra are given by : [ eq : sps ] p_s(k )  ( ) ( )  ;   p_t(k )  ( ) the above spectra allow us to draw important conclusions .",
    "firstly , the scalar and tensor power spectra of the spinflaton , in slow - roll , are nearly scale - invariant @xcite .",
    "secondly , in the leading order of @xmath18 , the spectra has a non - zero running :      it is interesting to note that the running of scalar spectral index ( @xmath19 ) is consistent with the wmap-5 year results @xcite .",
    "for instance , using the wmap value of @xmath20 @xcite and assuming that @xmath15 is tiny , we get @xmath21 . this is the one of the main predictions of spinflation .",
    "thirdly , the tensor - to - scalar ratio @xmath22 is no longer equal to @xmath23 and is given by : [ eq : r ] r 16 _ _ can [1- 2 _ ] .",
    "physically , this suggests that the gravitational wave contribution during slow - roll spinflation is smaller than for canonical inflation .",
    "lastly , as for the canonical scalar field , the scalar and tensor perturbations during spinflation originate from the scalar condensate and they are not independent . hence , consistency relations link them together .",
    "the one which is observationally useful is the relation between @xmath24 and @xmath22 : n__t= ( 1 + _ )  [ 1 + _ _ can [ c + _ - ] - 2__can c ] . to conclude",
    ", we have shown that the spinor condensate in the early universe is a viable model of cosmological inflation .",
    "it leads to the identical acceleration equation as that of canonical scalar field driven inflation .",
    "we have used the hedgehog ansatz to obtain the scalar perturbation and , in the slow - roll limit , we have shown that scalar and tensor perturbations are nearly scale invariant .",
    "the model predicts a running of scalar spectral index consistent with wmap-5 year data .",
    "the consistency relation between the scalar and tensor spectra are non - trivial and have different feature compared to the models where the scalar fields are considered elementary ."
