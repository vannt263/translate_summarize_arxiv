    "recently , considerable attention has been attracted to studies of gas coronae of galaxies , that is of reservoirs of gas extending up to the galaxies virial radii .",
    "this circumgalactic gas represents , thanks to the large volume it fills , a substantial contribution to the mass budget of a galaxy .",
    "this gaseous corona , or extended halo , of the milky way has attracted particular interest because of the `` missing - baryon '' problem , see e.g.  @xcite , the apparent lack of baryons in our galaxy compared to the amount expected , on average , from cosmology . on the other hand ,",
    "interactions of cosmic rays with this circumgalactic gas have been considered as a possible source of important contributions to the diffuse gamma - ray @xcite and neutrino @xcite backgrounds .    in the milky way",
    ", this reservoir of gas reveals itself in observations in two ways .",
    "first , the ram pressure of the gas strips dwarf satellite galaxies , whose orbits lay within the corona , from their own gas @xcite .",
    "second , the presence of the hot gas may be seen in x - ray spectra , either as zero - redshift absorption lines for extragalactic sources , or as emission lines in the blank - sky spectrum , see e.g.@xcite . taken at face value , the gas density profiles derived by these two methods are inconsistent with each other .",
    "however , the spectroscopic approach is based on observations of spectral lines of oxygen , which is only a tracer of the full amount of gas . as a result",
    ", the gas density obtained by the spectroscopic method is very sensitive to unknown chemical composition of the gas , usually encoded in its metallicity @xmath1 .",
    "the aim of this work is to depart from simplified ad hoc assumptions about the metallicity of the galactic corona and to use spectroscopic and ram - pressure results jointly , which allows us to constrain values and profiles of density and metallicity of the circumgalactic gas simultaneously , so that the agreement between all data is maintained .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : obs ] , observational constraints on the density of circumgalactic gas are discussed in detail . in particular , in sec .  [",
    "sec : x - ray ] , x - ray spectroscopic results are discussed and their dependence on the assumptions about metallicity is recalled .",
    "[ sec : ram ] discusses constraints from ram - pressure stripping of the milky - way satellites ; a combined fit of the most precise of these bounds is presented .",
    "other constraints are briefly mentioned in sec .",
    "[ sec : dm ] .",
    "section  [ sec : comb ] contains the main results of the paper and presents a combination of the constraints , allowing to determine both the density and the metallicity of circumgalactic gas in a joint fit by means of statistical marginalization .",
    "these results are discussed and compared to previous works in sec .",
    "[ sec : concl ] .",
    "observations of distant extragalactic sources in x rays reveal ovii and oviii absorption lines which , unlike others , are positioned at the redshift @xmath2 , indicating that they originate from hot absorbing gas near the observer . similar , but emission , lines were found in spectra of the sky obtained from directions where no sources are present .",
    "a large amount of observations were interpreted as an evidence for an extended circumgalactic gas halo .",
    "having high statistical significance , these results suffer however from considerable systematic uncertainties related to the fact that the observed oxygen is only a tracer of the full amount of gas , expected to be mostly hydrogen .",
    "suppose that the concentrations of heavy chemical elements in the gas follow those in the sun , so that they are encoded in a single parameter , metallicity .",
    "the true total electron density @xmath3 of the gas at the galactocentric distance @xmath4 is related to the value @xmath5 obtained in this approach ( see @xcite for a detailed discussion ) as @xmath6 where @xmath1 is the metallicity and @xmath7 is the ionization fraction , while @xmath8 and @xmath9 are their assumed values .",
    "previous works used @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the solar metallicity , and @xmath12 .",
    "note that only the product @xmath13 can be studied in our approach . for brevity",
    ", we hereafter fix @xmath14 and constrain the metallicity profile @xmath15 below .",
    "however , one should keep in mind that what is really constrained is @xmath16 .",
    "a general parametrization of the density radial dependence , which we adopt in our study as well , is the so - called `` beta profile '' , @xmath17 it has three parameters , the normalization @xmath18 , the slope @xmath19 and the inner cutoff radius @xmath20 .",
    "we are primarily interested in the outer parts of the corona ( at least , outside the galaxy ) , where the dependence on @xmath20 is negligible , and the electron density reduces to @xmath21 , so that the normalization parameter is now @xmath22 .",
    "it is this parameter which is normally constrained by observations , and it is used in what follows . whenever a particular value of @xmath20 is needed , @xmath23  kpc is used , though a change in this parameter has a negligible impact on the results .",
    "the reader may find the most recent discussion on constraining @xmath24 from x - ray spectroscopy in @xcite , while more details of the approach are presented in @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath25 , @xcite obtain best - fit values of @xmath26 and @xmath27  @xmath28kpc@xmath29 ( note a factor of 100 misprint in their abstract ) .",
    "the corresponding 68% allowed region in the parameter space , see their fig .  5 ,",
    "is shown as a dashed contour in fig .",
    "[ fig:2contours ] .",
    "another approach is based on the observation @xcite that the amount of gas in dwarf satellites residing within @xmath0  kpc from the centers of the milky way and m31 galaxies is much smaller than that observed in more distant dwarfs .",
    "this observation is interpreted in terms of the ram - pressure stripping due to travelling of the dwarf galaxies through the circumgalactic gas of their giant companions ( see , however , @xcite , where other potential contributions are discussed ) .",
    "several constraints on the density of the circumgalactic gas coming from observations of the milky - way satellites are collected in table  [ tab : dwarfs ] .    [ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the dominant source of uncertainty here is the orbit of a satellite , which determines the pericenter distance , where the stripping is most efficient . to quantify the ensemble of these results , the standard likelihood function , @xmath30 , in terms of the two parameters of the gas density distribution , @xmath31 and @xmath32 , is constructed .",
    "observations with very large uncertainties almost do not affect the result and are not taken into account , see table  [ tab : dwarfs ] .",
    "the resulting 68% c.l .",
    "contour in the parameter space is shown with the full line in fig .",
    "[ fig:2contours ] .",
    "note that this method constrains the gas density directly , without invoking any assumption on the metallicity .",
    "the constraint of @xcite , formulated in a different way ( an inequality based on a combined study of a sample of objects , bounding the volume - averaged gas density from below ) , is not included in the fit .",
    "we will return to this constraint in sec .",
    "[ sec : comb ] .      for completeness ,",
    "recall one more way to constrain the gas density directly .",
    "it relies on the observation of pulsar dispersion measures which are related to the column density of electrons along the line of sight .",
    "@xcite obtained an upper limit on the electron density integrated up to the lmc , assuming a certain contribution from the inner part of the milky way .",
    "we will return to this constraint in sec .",
    "[ sec : comb ] .",
    "another approach , more robust with respect to assumptions about the inner galactic gas , was based on individual pulsar studies @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig:2contours ] looks disappointing at first sight since the allowed parameter regions derived in two different approaches do not overlap .",
    "however  and this is the main point of the present letter ,  relaxing the assumption of the constant metallicity @xmath33 brings them into agreement",
    ". moreover , this opens a possibility to constrain , for the first time , the metallicity profile of the circumgalactic gas from observations .    to proceed further , we determine two likelihood functions corresponding to the two approaches : one is the @xmath34 determined in sec .  [ sec : ram ] and describing constraints from ram - pressure stripping ; another one , @xmath35 , is responsible for the x - ray constraints .",
    "the latter function should depend on parameters of the metallicity profile besides those of the density profile . to quantify this dependence , we assume a similar `` beta profile '' for the metallicity , @xmath36 at large distances from the galactic center , a straightforward comparison of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : * ] ) , ( [ eq : n_e ] ) and ( [ eq : metall ] ) results in simple relations between the true @xmath37 and reported ( under assumption of a certain metallicity ; @xmath38 ) parameters of the electron densities , @xmath39",
    "@xmath40 this allows one to generalize the likelihood @xmath41 to the more general @xmath42 .",
    "the original @xmath43 function is assumed to be a deformed gaussian reproducing the 68% c.l.contour of @xcite , that is the dashed contour in fig .",
    "[ fig:2contours ] , correctly .",
    "the standard statistical procedure allows one to determine combined constraints on the parameter pairs @xmath44 and @xmath45 by marginalization ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "let @xmath46 and @xmath47 be marginalized likelihood functions for the parameters of gas density and metallicity , respectively .",
    "then @xmath48 @xmath49 with the help of these new likelihood functions , best - fit values and 68% c.l",
    ".  contours for combined constraints are easily determined .",
    "resulting constraints on the metallicity profile , eq .",
    "( [ eq : metall ] ) , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : abmarg ] .    the shaded area there corresponds to the parameters resulting in the metallicity at the solar location exceeding @xmath11 .",
    "this information is indicative only since our study deals with the gas at much larger distances from the galactic center .",
    "the corresponding range of metallicity profiles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : met - profiles ] .",
    "figure  [ fig : density - marg ]    presents our constraints on the parameters of the density profile , eq .  ( [ eq : n_e ] ) , together with the regions excluded by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our 68% c.l .  allowed region satisfies their constraints .",
    "the corresponding range of density profiles is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : density - profiles ] .",
    "the results of this work eliminate the apparent discrepancy , see fig .",
    "[ fig:2contours ] , in parameters of the milky - way circumgalactic gas estimated from x - ray spectroscopy and from studies of ram - pressure stripping of galactic dwarf satellites .",
    "a combined analysis of the observational constraints , performed here , determines the range of the allowed metallicity profiles of the gas residing up to 250  kpc from the galactic center ( figs .",
    "[ fig : abmarg ] , [ fig : met - profiles ] ) . not surprisingly , the metallicity decreases considerably in the outer parts of the halo .",
    "importantly , we obtained constraints on the parameters of the gas density distribution from a combination of all available data ( figs .",
    "[ fig : density - marg ] , [ fig : density - profiles ] ) . compared to the profile of @xcite ,",
    "the best - fit one is flatter , resulting in higher gas density in the peripheral parts of the galactic corona and , consequently , in larger total gas mass .",
    "this agrees well with recent simulations @xcite and ultraviolet ovi observations @xcite indicating that the x - ray observations may underestimate the total amount of circumgalactic gas by a factor of two .",
    "it is interesting to compare the total gas mass with the `` missing baryon '' mass of the galaxy , since the halo of circumgalactic gas was suggested as an explanation of the mismatch between the milky - way and cosmological average baryon content @xcite .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ fig : density - marg ] , where a line corresponding to the required `` missing - baryon '' mass is shown , that our results support this explanation .",
    "the data we use can not say much about the properties of the gas in the inner parts of the corona , at galactocentric distances less than @xmath50  kpc .",
    "it is interesting to note that beyond this distance , the density profile of @xcite , obtained by simulations , is in a reasonable agreement with our observational constraints . at galactocentric distances",
    "@xmath51  kpc , the profile of @xcite deviates from the beta profile , eq .",
    "( [ eq : n_e ] ) , towards higher densities .",
    "unfortunately , this range of distances is not controlled by our approach ; therefore , higher densities are not experimentally excluded there .",
