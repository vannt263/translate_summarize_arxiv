    "photon orbital angular momentum ( poam ) , as compared to photon spin angular momentum , was less known in optics up until about two decades ago , mostly due to the technical difficulties in generating light with definite poam states and in finding appropriate applications for such light . in 1990 ,",
    "tamm and weiss @xcite first managed to produce laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) laser beams in the laboratory , which have helical phase front and quantized poam for further details . ] .",
    "their studies paved the way for later proposals on applications of lg modes , including applications on quantum information processing and quantum cryptography @xcite , or even on future generations of gravitational wave detectors @xcite .",
    "in addition , harwitt @xcite proposed several astrophysical sources or mechanisms that possibly introduce nonzero poam to light .",
    "these sources and mechanisms include maser beams that pass through inhomogeneous interstellar medium , luminous pulsars or quasars , and waves passing through the vicinity of a rotating black hole .",
    "recently , tamburini _",
    "@xcite performed a numerical simulation of radio emissions from an accretion disk surrounding a rotating black hole , assuming that different radiative sources in the disk are spatially coherent . in the simulation , they observed nontrivial poam generation and asymmetric spectra in terms of the lg - mode basis , depending on the spin of the host black hole and the observer s location in the sky .",
    "it remains physically important to understand the physical mechanism for the generation of light with poam near black holes , and obtain estimates for the poam magnitude , which apparently encodes information about the host black hole .    in this study",
    "we analyze the scalar wave emission from a coherent point source near a kerr or a schwarzschild black hole .",
    "we note that although the case of the electromagnetic wave which is considered in the above studies is a spin-@xmath0 field , in this paper we consider instead a complex scalar field , which has zero spin .",
    "we use the scalar field as a model for the electromagnetic field when its spin character is neglected .",
    "we employ this scalar model since it is a technically simpler case to study than the electromagnetic case and yet it is sufficient in order to understand the generation of poam spectra . by assuming the wavelength of the radiation ( not greater than @xmath1 scale ) to be much smaller than the size of the black hole ( not less than @xmath2 scale ) , we calculate the wave received by a distant observer on the celestial sphere and the corresponding poam spectrum .",
    "we investigate both the cases that the emission is temporally coherent and incoherent , as the two cases produce different poam spectra . for completeness",
    ", we also study the scenario that the observer is located near an optical caustic of the background space - time , in which case the poam asymmetry could be amplified , in addition to the wave itself .",
    "part of the wave emitted from the vicinity of the black hole immediately propagates outwards and reaches the far - away observer , thus yielding the so - called primary image .",
    "however , other parts of the wave will typically orbit around the black hole a number of times before leaving the vicinity of the black hole and propagating outwards to reach the far - away observer ; these wave signals will correspond to secondary images .",
    "we obtain the propagation of the wave via the calculation of an approximation to the retarded green function of the wave equation in kerr space - time . for the primary image we approximate the green function by using the so - called hadamard form ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) and a calculation of the so - called van vleck determinant , a biscalar which measures the degree of focusing of neighboring null geodesics . as for the later images  for which the hadamard form is not valid  we instead approximate the green function by a calculation of the quasi - normal modes in kerr space - time in the high - oscillation - frequency limit ( see , e.g.,@xcite ) .",
    "we shall show that , although the emission from a single non - rotating star in flat space - time generally contains only the fundamental lg mode ( which contains zero angular momentum ) at far distances , the presence of a rotating black hole near the star will generate a non - trivial poam spectrum .",
    "such spectrum is symmetric with respect to the lg basis ( i.e. , with respect to the azimuthal quantum number ) for non - rotating schwarzschild black holes and generically asymmetric for rotating kerr black holes .",
    "that is , the asymmetric part of the spectrum contains the spin information of rotating black holes . as we shall show in sec .",
    "[ sec : specdegen ] , the symmetric part of a poam spectrum may be affected by the direction of the observation plane of a telescope array .",
    "this further emphasizes the importance of measuring the asymmetric part of the spectrum .",
    "an important difference between the case we study in this paper and that in @xcite is that here , as opposed to @xcite , we have a pointlike emission source .",
    "therefore , the interference between waves emitted from sources at different spatial locations that occurs in @xcite is absent here . in our case ,",
    "the main effect comes only from gravitationally twisting / merging the light bundles from a single emission source and we therefore expect the spectral asymmetry to be much smaller than in @xcite ( see secs .  [",
    "sec : wave ] and [ sec4 ] for details ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we review the decomposition of a paraxial wave with respect to the lg basis , the definition of a poam spectrum and the related quantity for detection . in sec .  [ sec : gf ] we describe the methods used for the calculation of the green function . in sec .",
    "[ sec : wave ] we analyze the wave emitted by a source near a black hole , using the green function approach , and present our poam results . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] we investigate the setting where the observer is located near an optical caustic and we conclude in sec .  [ sec5 ] . throughout this paper , we use geometric units @xmath3 , the black hole mass @xmath4 is also set to @xmath0 , unless otherwise specified , and the metric signature is taken to be @xmath5 .",
    "in this section , we present a cursory review of the lg modes of light and the corresponding poam - spectrum decomposition , which is useful for later sections .",
    "interested readers may find a detailed discussion in @xcite on topics such as poam observables in astronomy , the propagation or map of poam from the celestial sphere onto detectors , the detection of poam using existing astronomical instruments , etc .",
    "let us consider a light beam propagating on a general space - time .",
    "we now describe two approximations .",
    "we will apply the first to the propagation of the beam all the way from the source to the observer ( i.e. , throughout the curved space - time ) , while will apply the second one only near the observer ( i.e. , where the space - time is asymptotically flat ) .",
    "the first approximation is the ` scalar field approximation ' , under which the vector character of the electromagnetic field is neglected . under this approximation ,",
    "the electromagnetic field is just described by a distribution of the field amplitude and phase , which is given by a complex scalar wave function @xmath6 that satisfies the klein - gordon equation : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a space - time point , @xmath9 is the background space - time metric , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the source of the field . physically , this approximation is valid , for example , when one of the components of the traverse field dominates over the other one . in flat spacetime",
    "( such as near the observation plane in an astrophysical context ) , where it is a common approximation ( e.g. , @xcite ) , one may alternatively view the scalar field @xmath12 as representing one of the cartesian components of the electric or magnetic field . in curved space - time",
    ", we expect this approximation to be valid in the he high - frequency limit that we adopt in this paper , particularly in the situation of sec.[sec3b ] where only the part of the wave on , or closely near , one single image ( the primary one ) is considered . in the situation of sec.[sec3a ] , where various images  which folloow different paths around the black hole  are considered this approximation may be less valid , because the polarization of the electromagnetic field could rotate differently along different path . in that case , more careful analysis has to be done to take into account the rotation of field polarizations .",
    "let us now carry out a fourier - mode decomposition of the complex scalar field @xmath6 and denote its fourier modes by @xmath13 , where @xmath14 denotes the spatial coordinates of @xmath8 and @xmath15 the frequency .",
    "since in this paper we will be considering a source radiating with a single frequency , the spatial part of the total field @xmath6 will be given by a single fourier mode ( see eq.([eqpsigreen ] ) below ; the only exception will be in eq.([eqmulfreq ] ) ) .    in order to introduce the lg mode decomposition now and",
    "for the rest of this subsection we assume flat space - time . even though in this paper we deal with the presence of a black hole",
    ", the emmitted wave will propagate from the strong - field near the black hole all the way to earth , where the space - time is asymptotically flat . here",
    ", a connection can be made between the emitted wave as detected on earth and the lg basis defined in flat space - time . in flat space - time , the fourier modes satisfy the helmholtz equation : @xmath16 where @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the wave vector and @xmath19 is the laplacian operator in flat space - time .",
    "the lg basis requires a second approximation : the paraxial approximation , under which the wave propagates approximately along an axis , say the @xmath20-axis ( i.e. , @xmath21,@xmath22 using cartesian coordinates ) .",
    "this is generally a good approximation when the light ( even though strictly speaking we are now dealing with a scalar field , we use it to model light  within the scalar field approximation  and so at times we might still refer to the wave as ` light ' ) is far away from its emission source .",
    "this approximation is well justified in the astrophysical setting when the wave has reached a distant observer after travelling all the way from near the black hole and so the celestial sphere is locally a plane . under the paraxial approximation",
    "the spatial wave function @xmath23 can be expanded as a family of lg modes @xmath24 , which have the following form ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) :    @xmath25    where we use a cylindrical coordinate system @xmath26 for the spatial point @xmath14 , @xmath27 is a normalization constant , @xmath28 is a laguerre polynomial , @xmath29 is the azimuthal quantum number and @xmath30 is the radial quantum number .",
    "we have defined the functions @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the size of the beam waist , @xmath33 is the rayleigh length and @xmath34 is the wavelength of the light .    because of the @xmath35 factor , the phase fronts of lg modes ( except for the fundamental mode @xmath36 ) are helical , and the mode with indices @xmath37 carries a definite orbital angular momentum @xmath38 per photon",
    "this can be intuitively understood by noticing that the wave vectors are spiraling around the propagation ( @xmath20 ) axis ( @xmath39 and @xmath40 are small but non - zero ) .",
    "it can also be shown that lg modes form a complete basis for all the paraxial waves with the same frequency .",
    "therefore , at a given value of @xmath20 , any spatial wave function @xmath23 can be decomposed in the basis of lg modes as @xmath41 where the coefficients are given by @xmath42 where the product of any two spatial functions @xmath43 and @xmath23 is defined on the constant-@xmath20 plane as : @xmath44    for the purpose of understanding the generation of poam spectra , there is limited interest in distinguishing the radial profile of the wave function . as a result , we sum up all the radial components for each value of @xmath29 , so that the decomposition becomes @xmath45 where @xmath46 is given by @xmath47    we further define the spectra weight @xmath48 of the poam decomposition as @xmath49    based on their definition , it is easy to verify that the weights @xmath48 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath50 , and so the averaged poam per photon is given by @xmath51    the definition of @xmath48 can easily be generalized @xcite to incoherent light by decomposing the wave function as a summation of coherent pieces and dropping the mutual - interference terms .",
    "its physical properties can be further elaborated by studying the two following simple examples .      in the first example",
    ", we note that a plane wave , with its propagation direction orthogonal to the observation plane , satisfies @xmath52 , i.e , all modes have zero spectra weight except for the fundamental mode .",
    "this fact is important as any initially distorted wavefront always tends to flatten out during propagation in free space , because of the diffraction effect . since real telescopes",
    "have a finite collection area , which also means that the integration upper bound for @xmath53 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqweight ] ) and ( [ eqnorm ] ) should be replaced by the instrument s size , the spectra weights for the modes with @xmath54 always decrease as we increase the distance between the detector and the source .    in the second example , if the wave function has a dependence @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is a real - valued function , it can be shown that the @xmath48 s are generically nonzero and the spectrum must be symmetric , i.e. , @xmath57 ( see sec .  [ sec3b ] for a proof in the case @xmath58 ; the generalization to higher @xmath59 is trivial ) .",
    "in fact , if we draw the normal vectors to the constant - phase plane of a lg mode with @xmath60 , it shows a spiraling pattern which geometrically resembles a twisted light bundle .",
    "this twisting of light can be generated , for example , by the frame - dragging caused by a rotating black hole ( sec .",
    "[ sec3b ] ) , by merging adjacent light bundles near an optical caustic ( sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] ) , or even by the offset - interference between previously far - apart geometric rays ( sec .",
    "[ sec3a ] )  see fig .",
    "[ fig : interf ] . in all these scenarios ,",
    "we observe variations in both the phase and the amplitude .",
    "this is also true for the lg modes as shown in eq .",

    "( [ eqandec ] ) or physically using an antenna array as illustrated in @xcite . as a consequence",
    ", although we shall refer to @xmath63 as the spectral asymmetry throughout this paper , more strictly speaking it corresponds to the  amplitude \" asymmetry .",
    "amplitude \" asymmetry can be measured by comparing phases on different sites of the telescope array , and its detectability is closely related to the phase sensitivity of the telescope array .",
    "the ground - based radio telescopes suffer from air - turbulence - induced phase errors , and by implementing novel techniques , such as measuring the _ closure phase _",
    "@xcite , the phase sensitivity can be improved to a scale of multiple wavelengths @xcite .",
    "a symmetric weight spectrum can be generated by tilting the observation plane with respect to the optical axis , as this generally introduces a @xmath64 factor into the wave , depending on the tilt angles @xmath65 and @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the radius between the source ( or approximately the black hole ) and the observation plane , and @xmath68 are coordinates on the observation plane defined in sec.[sec3a ] . even for an incoming plane wave , this phase factor will generate a _",
    "symmetric _ poam spectrum , with @xmath69 , where @xmath70 is the size of the detector .",
    "unless the tilt angles are known within an accuracy of @xmath71 , which is an unrealistic requirement , it generates a much larger symmetric poam spectrum than the @xmath60 components of the poam spectrum induced by a rotating black - hole geometry .",
    "thus , the physics carried by a symmetric poam is degenerate with the tilt angle of the observation plane , and is not likely to be decoded via radio observations alone .",
    "in order to determine the wave emission by a point source , we shall make use of the retarded green function of the wave equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) satisfied by the field propagating in the background space - time .",
    "the retarded green function can also be used to calculate the self - force on a small compact object moving on the background of a massive black hole ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) and the associated radiation back - reaction .",
    "techniques for the calculation of the green function for field perturbations of different spin in schwarzschild , kerr or other more exotic background space - times have been recently developed  @xcite and applied  @xcite with success to the calculation of the self - force . in this paper",
    "we will employ some of these techniques for the calculation of the green function to calculate the propagation of a scalar wave in kerr space - time and we refer the reader to this literature for further details on the techniques .    as explained in sec.([sec : mode decomp ] ) , we use a massless , complex scalar field @xmath6 to model the electromagnetic field when its spin character is neglected .",
    "this scalar field propagating on a curved space - time obeys the klein - gordon equation ( [ eq : kg ] ) .",

    "specifically , we take the source to be @xmath79 from eq.([eq : psi via gf ] ) , the wave that an observer located at the space - time point @xmath8 receives is simply given by @xmath80 although the integration upper bound is here taken to be @xmath81 , the integration actually contains only the causal contributions because the retarded green function is zero if @xmath8 does not lie in the causal future of @xmath74 . for simplicity , we assume hereafter that the emitter stays at a fixed spatial location @xmath82 at all times . despite the fact that this is not a very physical scenario , it does not harm the main physical results and it simplifies the calculations .",

    "c'_1)+\\omega \\theta(c_2 ) ] } \\nonumber \\\\ & = 2\\pi \\omega^{1/6 } { \\rm ai}(c'_1)e^{i \\omega \\theta(c_2)}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath327 denotes the airy function which is real - valued  see fig .",
    "[ fig : fold ] for an illustration .",
    "the new variables @xmath305 and @xmath328 are here defined as @xmath329     near a fold point via eq.([eqpsifoldline ] ) . ]",
    "we can see from eq .",
    "( [ eqpsifoldline ] ) that the wave intensity is amplified by a factor of @xmath330 near a fold line , which is brighter than a generic point on the celestial sphere , but dimmer than a cusp point .",
    "similar to the analysis performed near a cusp point , we expand the celestial coordinates in the observation plane as : @xmath314 , and the wave function can also be expanded as @xmath331e^{i \\omega \\theta}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    correspondingly , we obtain the strength of @xmath332 to be proportional to @xmath218 , which comes from the phase variation along the fold line ; the asymmetry @xmath264 is directly proportional to @xmath333 and it is attributed to the phase beating between @xmath334 and @xmath335 . for a millimeter - wavelength source near sagittarius a * , if earth happens to be close to the fold line in the celestial sphere , the inferred poam spectral asymmetry is about @xmath336 .    as we have already seen from the wave behavior near a fold line or a cusp point , the generating functions are not proportional to @xmath15 along the control variables direction , and the amplitudes usually oscillate fast .",
    "this happens because a family of light - rays merge with each other at the optical caustic , and their interference gives these unusual frequency - dependences .",
    "it is the same merging interference which also generates the net poam shown here .",
    "in this work , we have studied a wave that is emitted near a rotating black hole and eventually reaches a distant observer . we demonstrated that measuring the distortion of the wavefront provides an independent channel for obtaining information about the source , in addition to light - bending or other spectroscopic measurements . in order to characterize the wavefront distortion , we have adopted the previously - established poam decomposition and we have applied it to the wave , which we have computed using the retarded green function in kerr space - time .",
    "while the poam spectra of waves scattered by schwarzschild black holes are shown to be always symmetric , any rotation in the host black hole generically generates asymmetry in the poam spectrum .",
    "since the symmetric part of the spectrum is degenerate with the tilt angle of the observation plane , we conclude that it is more likely to extract information about the source from the asymmetric part .",
    "the resulting poam spectrum strongly depends on the temporal coherence of the emission source and the sky - location of the receiver . on the one hand , we find that the main contribution to the symmetric spectrum weight comes from the phase - variation in the sky of the direct signal . for generic receiver s locations ,",
    "the magnitude of the square root of the weight , @xmath332 , is of order of @xmath218 , which is roughly the ratio between the size of the telescope and the airy disk size of the image , and it could be as large as @xmath221 for millimeter - wavelength sources near sagittarius a*. if the receiver is located near a cusp point on the sky , we have shown , using techniques developed in catastrophe optics , that @xmath337 ; if the receiver is near a fold line in the sky , we have shown that @xmath288 instead .",
    "on the other hand , we have shown that the asymmetric part of the poam spectrum could be generated by the beating between phase and amplitude variation of the primary signal , or by the beating between the phase variation of the primary and secondary signals .",
    "this beating reflects the physical origin of nonzero poam , either by coherently combining rays mis - aligned optical - axis , or by the interference of adjacent light bundles .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the spectral asymmetry is generally too weak to be measured .",
    "this is in part due to the large distances between earth and astrophysical black holes , which serve as strong - gravity lenses or  phase plates \" .",
    "the best candidate for detection might be an extended region in the accretion disk near sagittarius a * such that earth lies near a fold line of its radiation . in this case , the spectral asymmetry for the @xmath338 mode can be as large as @xmath336 .",
    "however , even with advanced techniques available to cancel the effects from atmosphere turbulence , e.g. adaptive optics methods , this signal is still far below the sensitivity of current radio telescopes , such as millimeter - wavelength very long baseline interferometry arrays .",

    "<S> in particular , we assume a coherent emission source near the black hole and investigate the wavefront distortion as seen by a distant observer . by ignoring the spin nature of the electromagnetic radiation we model it by a complex scalar field . </S>",

    "<S> we find that this decomposition spectrum is symmetric with respect to the azimuthal quantum number in the case that the wave source is located near a non - rotating ( schwarzschild ) black hole , whereas the spectrum is generically asymmetric if the host black hole is rotating ( kerr ) . the spectral asymmetry , or the net orbital angular momentum carried by the wave , is intimately related to the black hole spin and mass , the wave frequency and the locations of the source and the observer . </S>",
    "<S> we present semi - analytical expressions and numerical results for these parameter - dependences . </S>",
    "<S> if the emitted radiation is temporally coherent , our results show that the secondary images ( arising from the orbiting of the wavefront around the black hole ) of the source can be almost as bright as its primary image . separately , in the case of temporally - incoherent radiation , we show that the non - fundamental spectrum components in the primary image could be resolved by spatially - separated telescopes , although that would be degenerate with the telescope direction . </S>",
    "<S> finally , our results suggest that the black - hole - induced spectral asymmetry is generally too weak to be observed in radio astronomy , even if the observer were located near an optical caustic . </S>"
