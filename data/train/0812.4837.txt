    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) dipolar excitons , in which electrons ( @xmath0 ) and holes ( @xmath1 ) are spatially separated , can be created in structures of coupled ( cqws ) quantum wells ( qws ) @xcite and single qw ( sqw ) in a strong external transverse electric field @xcite . at low temperatures , @xmath0 and @xmath1 in these systems reside in the lowest transverse ( with respect to the qw plane ) quantized states . in this case , the dipole moments of excitons ( in the ground axially symmetric state ) are all directed perpendicular to this plane .",
    "there are two types of excitons in cqws : direct excitons , whose electrons and holes are in the same qw , and spatially indirect excitons , whose electrons and holes are located in different qws ( see details in experimental studies @xcite ) . in the second case , exciton dipole moment is @xmath2 , where the quantity @xmath3 is determined by the geometry and is equal to the characteristic interwell distance ( see eq .",
    "( [ d ] ) below ) . in single quantum wells",
    ", a dipolar exciton can occur due to a strong transverse electric field , which induces a dipole moment @xcite . in both cases , unlike quasi-2d atomic gases @xcite , two 2d dipolar excitons can not pass `` over one another '' in the qw plane .",
    "dipolar interaction of 2d excitons is theoretically studied in ref .",
    "@xcite .    at low exciton densities , 2d dipolar excitons are far from each other ,",
    "so exchange effects between electrons ( holes ) of neighboring excitons are suppressed by a dipole barrier , related to a exciton dipole - dipole repulsion , @xmath4 here , @xmath5 is the probability for a 2d dipolar exciton to tunnel through the dipole barrier ; @xmath6 is the exciton mass ; @xmath7 is the ground - state energy of the excitons ( their kinetic and dipolar - interaction energies ) ; @xmath8 is the exciton number ; @xmath9 ) is the dipolar exciton potential ; @xmath10 is the exciton diameter ( which is of the order of the average distance @xmath11 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 in the exciton ) ; and @xmath12 is the classical turning point for the potential @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) . in this case ,",
    "2d dipolar excitons can be considered as ( composite ) bosons . at high exciton densities ,",
    "at which the distance between neighboring excitons is smaller or of the order of the exciton radius , the fermi properties of the internal exciton structure play a significant role .",
    "this leads to a transformation of a dipolar exciton gas into an @xmath0-@xmath1 system @xcite ( although , in the isotropic system at @xmath15 , the crossover from an exciton bose condensate to a bcs state , with the gap decreasing with an increase in the density , occurs @xcite ) .",
    "the possibility of the bose condensation of 3d excitons was under consideration long ago @xcite .",
    "however , in a homogeneous infinite 2d system , because of the ultraviolet divergence of the exciton momentum distribution , the bose condensation is possible only at @xmath15 @xcite . in the range of finite temperatures , only a quasi - long - range ( power - law ) order @xcite and a superfluid phase can occur , which are destroyed due to the dissociation of pairs of oppositely directed vortices and formation of free vortices at the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) transition point @xcite .",
    "however , in _ finite _",
    "2d systems ( traps ) , the ultraviolet divergence of the momentum distribution is cut off , so , the bose condensate can exist @xcite .",
    "this opens opportunities for studying the bose condensation of 2d dipolar excitons in real experimental systems .    at present , the search for the bose condensation of 2d dipolar excitons in cqws @xcite and in sqw has attracted much attention from researchers .",
    "interesting optical effects observed in studying the luminescence of 2d dipolar excitons in cqws at low temperatures point to significant experimental progress in the investigation of the collective properties of 2d dipolar excitons @xcite .",
    "the observations of a narrow - beam luminescence from a 2d dipolar exciton bose condensate along a normal to the qw plane and of the off - diagonal long - range order of bose condensed 2d dipolar excitons in the coherence experiment have recently been performed by timofeev et al . in sqw in a transverse electric field @xcite .    theoretically , for the collective state of 2d dipolar excitons in qws , superfluidity @xcite , bose condensation @xcite ( in the exciton regime ) , a bcs - like state @xcite ( in the @xmath0-@xmath1 system ) , strong correlations @xcite , crystallization @xcite and a mesoscopic supersolid phase @xcite , kinetic and relaxation processes @xcite , vortical @xcite and quasi - josephson @xcite effects , optical properties @xcite as well as these in circular traps @xcite , a superfluid transition ( crossover ) in traps @xcite , as well as the effect of random fields @xcite , were studied .",
    "the superfluidity of bose condensed dipolar excitons was also studied in two - layer @xmath0-@xmath0 systems in a strong magnetic field with the half - occupancy of the landau levels in each layer ( @xmath16 ; see , e.g. , the theory in ref .",
    "@xcite and experiments in ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "2d dipolar bosons were also studied in rarefied atomic gases @xcite and polar molecules @xcite .    among the above studies into the exciton bose condensate , the model of an ideal exciton gas and that of a weakly correlated exciton gas were predominantly used as theoretical approaches . unfortunately ,",
    "these approaches have a rather limited domain of applicability .",
    "indeed , at low densities , the repulsive dipole potential can be described by only one parameter , the length @xmath17 of the isotropic @xmath18-scattering .",
    "therefore , the properties of such a potential should be universal , i.e. , the same for all interaction potentials having the same scattering length ; in particular , the properties should be the same as for the system of hard disks with the diameter @xmath17 .",
    "however , the latter system is known to be weakly correlated only in the ultrararefied case @xcite .",
    "consequently , the model of weakly correlated excitons is valid only for ultrararefied systems , whose critical temperature is extremely low . for real experimentally observed densities ,",
    "this model can give only a qualitative description .",
    "therefore , the quantitative theoretical investigation of the 2d qw dipolar exciton collective state requires a more accurate model and more precise , desirably , ab initio , calculations .",
    "this work is devoted to the detailed microscopic investigation of 2d dipolar excitons by means of the numerical simulation by the diffusion monte carlo method .",
    "the main result of our simulation is the inference that , in the experimentally observed low - temperature regime @xcite , 2d dipolar excitons in cqws form a strongly correlated system @xcite .",
    "we find the following evidences for this fact .",
    "\\(i ) the dimensionless adiabatic compressibility @xmath19 @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is the corresponding dimensional quantity ) and the contribution @xmath22 to the chemical potential @xmath23 related to the dipolar exciton - exciton interaction prove to be much greater than unity , @xmath24 ( here , @xmath25 is the total exciton density in all the @xmath26 spin degrees ; @xmath27 for gaas ) . for weakly correlated excitons , @xmath28 .",
    "\\(ii ) the density @xmath29 of the exciton bose condensate ( in all the @xmath26 spin degrees ) at @xmath15 proves to be two to four times smaller than the total density @xmath25 ( in the regime of weak correlations , @xmath30 ) .",
    "\\(iii ) a clearly pronounced hump is observed both in the pair distribution function and in the structure factor , which points to the presence of the short - range order .",
    "in addition , at higher exciton densities , e.g. , at @xmath31 @xmath32 , two humps are observed in the structure factor and three in the pair distribution function .",
    "\\(iv ) the spectrum of excitons is very far from the bogolyubov shape ( although , even at the boundary between the exciton and @xmath0-@xmath1 regimes , the roton minimum is not yet reached under the experimental conditions of refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "\\(v ) the local superfluid exciton density at the superfluid transition temperature , @xmath33 , is close to the total exciton density @xmath25 ( whereas , for weakly correlated systems , the quantity @xmath33 is logarithmically small compared to @xmath25 @xcite ) @xcite .",
    "\\(vi ) the temperature of the superfluid transition in the corresponding infinite system is only slightly less than the degeneracy temperature @xmath34 , while the quasi - condensation temperature is 2 - 2.5 times higher than @xmath34 ( for the spin - depolarized exciton gas in all the @xmath27 spin degrees ) .",
    "in contrast , according to the theory of weakly correlated excitons , these temperatures are logarithmically small compared to @xmath34 @xcite .",
    "\\(vii ) the profile of the exciton bose condensate in a large 2d harmonic trap at @xmath15 appreciably differs from the thomas - fermi inverted parabola .",
    "in some structures of cqws @xcite and sqw @xcite , the condensed gas of 2d dipolar excitons forms a system with intermediate correlations ( @xmath35 ) . in this case , the above evidences weaken ( evidence ( iii ) vanishes ) .",
    "however , in structures of cqws and sqw with the width of these wells being sufficiently large , at high densities of excitons , their correlations prove to be so strong that a roton minimum appears ( and even the crystallization of excitons is possible ; see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ measur ] , the model is discussed , the problem is formulated , and the relation with experiment is considered .",
    "also , the details of simulation are presented .",
    "section [ results ] is devoted to a homogeneous exciton system .",
    "a detailed analytical processing is constructed based on the ab initio numerical simulation , with the microscopic parameters of the problem being calculated . using these results , in section [ harm ]",
    ", we analytically investigate a large harmonic trap in the local density approximation .",
    "the possibilities of experimental observation of strong correlations in the system of 2d dipolar excitons in cqws are discussed in section [ lum ] . in section [ concl ]",
    "we conclude the study .",
    "two 2d spatially separated excitons repel each other as dipoles , @xmath36 , if the distance between them is much longer than the effective spacing @xmath3 between @xmath0 and @xmath1 layers . in the exciton regime , the distance between neighboring excitons in structures of refs .",
    "@xcite , according to a rough estimate ( see details in @xcite ) , exceeds @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the model of dipolar excitons is a good approximation for experimentally studied systems .",
    "the suppression of the exchange interaction by the dipole barrier in the exciton regime makes it possible to consider 2d dipolar excitons as structureless bosons @xcite .    as a result , at @xmath37 ,",
    "we arrive at the following hamiltonian of the homogeneous system of structureless 2d dipolar excitons : @xmath38 here , @xmath39 is the parameter with the dimension of length for the exciton dipole - dipole potential @xmath13 , @xmath40 @xmath41 @xmath2 is the dipole moment of an exciton , @xmath42 is the hole charge , @xmath43 is the dielectric constant of the structure , @xmath44 is the dielectric permittivity of vacuum , and @xmath45 is the effective distance between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 layers , where @xmath46 and @xmath47 are , respectively , the electron and the hole wave functions along the @xmath48 axis .",
    "we impose periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this , on the one hand , makes the system finite and , on the other hand , imitates its homogeneity . in this case , the momentum becomes discrete but remains good quantum number .",
    "at the first stage , in calculations by the variational monte carlo method , we specify the trial function of the ground state of excitons to be a bijl - jastrow function @xmath49 where , @xmath50 here , @xmath51 is the modified bessel function of the second kind ( the macdonald function ) of the zeroth order , @xmath52 , and @xmath53 is the dimensionless size of the system @xmath54 .",
    "the constants @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 are chosen from the condition @xmath58 and continuity conditions of the zeroth and first derivatives at @xmath59 , and the joining point @xmath60 is used as the ( only ) variational parameter .",
    "we expect that the trial wave function ( [ psi ] ) is a good approximation for the wave function of the ground state .",
    "when two excitons approach close each other , the influence of remaining exciton pairs becomes small , and the function @xmath61 corrresponds to the solution of the two - particle scattering problem from the dipole - dipole potential . at short distances ,",
    "function ( [ f ] ) is chosen such that it corresponds to the exact solution of the scattering problem for zero energy .",
    "we also verified that the use of the numerical solution to the scattering problem at finite energy as a two - particle factor of @xmath61 in the bijl - jastrow function weakly varies the variational energy of the system and almost does not affect the diffusion value of the energy .",
    "the long - wavelength behavior of the function @xmath61 is determined by the collective properties and corresponds to the phonon propagation in the 2d system : @xmath62 @xcite .",
    "the second term is added to the exponent of the exponential in eq .",

    "for a harmonic trap with a large excton number , we analytically calculated the total and bose condensate profiles .",
    "we showed that , in all experiments on bose condensation performed at present , 2d dipolar excitons in coupled qws prove to be strongly correlated . as a consequence ,",
    "exciton bose condensation and superfluidity can experimentally be achieved much easily than this is predicted by the models of an ideal and weakly correlated exciton gases .",
    "the results obtained for the ground - state energy @xmath125 , chemical potential @xmath390 , the adiabatic compressibility @xmath21 , the sound velocity @xmath230 , the excitation spectrum @xmath150 , and the bose condensate @xmath29 and local superfluid @xmath391 densities , as well as for the characteristic microscopic phonon length scale @xmath141 , can be used as reference data in construction of quantitative hydrodynamic theory of the optical properties of 2d dipolar excitons in qws , in particular , of their luminescence , coherence , and nonlinear effects .",
    "on long - wavelength scales ( @xmath142 ) , the one - body density matrix ( [ r1 ] ) of bose condensed 2d dipolar excitons at @xmath15 can be calculated within the framework of the hydrodynamic method in quantum field theory @xcite , @xmath393 here , @xmath394 is the phase of the exciton field operator @xmath146 ( @xmath395 ) , which satisfies the commutation relation @xmath396=0 $ ] , and @xmath397 does not depend on @xmath149 .",
    "we assume that an ultraviolet cutoff is imposed ( in this case , the quantities @xmath57 and @xmath398 diverge in the ultraviolet limit , but , at @xmath142 , @xmath29 and @xmath399 are finite in the large - momentum limit ) .    at @xmath15 , the phase - phase correlator @xmath399 in eq .",
    "( [ r1cum ] ) can be expressed via the phase - phase green s function ( in dimensional units ) , @xmath400\\rangle e^{-\\frac i{\\hbar}{\\bf pr}+i\\omega t}d{\\bf r}dt,\\ ] ] as follows : @xmath401 where @xmath402 is the chronological operator .    in the hydrodynamic ( long - wavelength ) approximation , in which the hydrodynamic hamiltonian acquires the form local in time , the function @xmath403 is given by @xcite @xmath404 where @xmath405 is the global superfluid exciton density ( in the @xmath26 spin degrees ) .    in the calculated density range ( @xmath406 ) , excitons are in the gas phase @xcite .",
    "in addition , we neglect the external random potential , which is unavoidably present in heterostructures . in this case , the global superfluid exciton density at @xmath15 coincides with the total density ( see @xcite and section [ outnl ] ) , @xmath407    from eqs .",
    "( [ ff0])-([ns = n ] ) we obtain the following equation for the correlator @xmath399 at @xmath15 @xmath408 @xmath409 @xmath410 @xmath145 here , we used the fact that , at @xmath142 ( i.e. , at @xmath411 ) , the @xmath412-like contribution @xmath413 is zero in a box of a size @xmath54 ( @xmath215 is the integer - valued vector ) .    by substituting ( [ fft ] ) into ( [ r1cum ] ) and averaging over the polar angle of the vector @xmath149 , we arrive at the sought hydrodynamic equation ( [ r1hd ] ) for the one - body density matrix of bose condensed 2d dipolar excitons at @xmath15 , which , on long - wavelength scales ( @xmath142 ) , coincides excellently with our dmc simulation ( see fig .",
    "3(e ) ) .    in conclusion , we note that , in interacting systems with the finite scattering length , the spectrum of excitations @xmath150 , at @xmath414 , exponentially approaches the spectrum of the ideal gas @xmath415 ( where @xmath416 ; see also item ( 2 ) in appendix b ) .",
    "consequently , at @xmath414 , the quantity @xmath417 under the summation sign in ( [ fft ] ) is of the order of @xmath418 .",
    "therefore , eq .  ( [ fft ] ) for the phase - phase correlator converges in the ultraviolet limit .",
    "this means that the well - known ultraviolet cutoff @xcite in quantum - field hydrodynamics at the boundary of the long - wavelength band ( @xmath419 , @xmath420 ) proves to be redundant in ( [ fft ] ) : an infinitely small cutoff suffices to ensure convergence .    however , one should bear in mind that the hydrodynamic ( long - wavelength ) approximation fails to adequately describe the phase - phase correlator on microscopic scales @xmath151 , @xmath247 .",
    "so , the range @xmath247 is incorrectly taken into account in ( [ fft ] ) . as a result , the hydrodynamic approach used in this study introduces a certain error in the calculation of the one - body density matrix and , therefore , in the bose condensate density .",
    "however , direct calculation shows that , if a continuous finite ultraviolet cutoff is introduced in ( [ fft ] ) at @xmath420 , the correction to the bose condensate density will rapidly vanish at large @xmath8 .",
    "the numerical calculation of the sum in ( [ fft ] ) shows that , at @xmath110 , this correction is of the order of 0.001 .",
    "here , we will discuss subtle aspects of calculations of the excitation spectrum , the local superfluid density , and the quasicondensed and superfluid transition temperatures .",
    "\\(1 ) as boronat et al . showed @xcite , in strongly correlated systems on intermediate scales , the true spectrum lies lower than the spectrum calculated by the feynman formula ( although , the weaker the correlations , the more exact the feynman formula ) .",
    "therefore , in the strong - correlation regime , our calculation of the local superfluid fraction , as well as the quasicondensation @xmath254 and the bkt transition @xmath256 temperatures is valid only qualitatively .",
    "\\(2 ) for simplicity , the excitation spectrum was estimated omitting the effects connected with a large damping of elementary excitations above the endpoint of the spectrum @xcite .",
    "\\(3 ) the landau formula is valid only in the collisionless ( not hydrodynamic ) regime when elementary excitations weakly interact , and their damping is small .",
    "this is definitely not the case above the spectrum endpoint @xmath421 . in a dense system , the spectrum endpoint lies high ( see fig .  6(a ) and @xcite ) , so that the range @xmath422 is cut in ( [ nl ] ) by the bose exponential ( [ nep ] ) . at low densities",
    ", the spectrum endpoint @xmath421 corresponds to smaller frequencies , but a significant damping appears only above the sound range of the spectrum .",
    "this range is also cut by the bose exponential ( see ( [ nl])-([t0 ] ) and figs .",
    "6(a ) , 7(b ) ) .",
    "however , at very low densities @xmath73 , where excitons are weakly correlated , the hydrodynamic regime can occur precisely in that range of the spectrum which makes the main contribution to the landau formula . in this case , eq .",
    "( [ nl ] ) does not hold .",
    "however , according to our direct estimation , even at a smallest calculated density of @xmath99 , such a situation is not realized .",
    "\\(4 ) in calculation of the local component , we set @xmath255 in eqs .",
    "( [ nl ] ) and ( [ nep ] ) .",
    "indeed , at low temperatures , @xmath423 , the bose exponential ( [ nep ] ) leaves in ( [ nl ] ) only the contribution from long - wavelength scales , on which @xmath424 . at high temperatures , ( @xmath293 , @xmath425 ) , owing to the factor @xmath426 in eq .",
    "( [ nl ] ) , long - wavelength scales do not contribute . on scales in the range of shorter ( microscopic ) wavelengths , the spectrum calculated by the feynman formula",
    "is weakly affected by temperature variations .",
    "the latter fact was revealed in the course of the monte carlo simulation of the pair distribution function and the structure factor in liquid helium up to temperatures so high ( 4.2 k ) as the doubled temperature of the @xmath427 point , @xmath428 k @xcite .",
    "\\(5 ) the temperature of quasicondensation @xmath254 we formally calculate from the condition @xmath429 , where @xmath259 is given by eq .  ( [ nl ] ) with @xmath260 .",
    "this is an approximate estimate , since , in the range of crossover at temperatures near @xmath254 , the local superfluidity and the local long - range order vanish , elementary excitations cease to form a nearly ideal gas , and the quantum regime goes to the classical regime .",

    "therefore , the equality @xmath435 at @xmath257 in 2d systems with quantized transverse motion holds only if correlations are rather strong . in the case of intermediate correlations ,",
    "the fulfillment of the equality @xmath435 at @xmath257 is worse .                                in the weak correlation regime ( @xmath138 ) , the equalities @xmath436 ( @xmath437 is the oscillator length , @xmath313 is the trap frequency , and we set @xmath438 ) are implemented .",
    "therefore , at @xmath138 , the lda validity conditions @xmath439 and @xmath440 , which are widely used in the literature on atom bose condensation ( g. baymand and c. j. pethick , phys .",
    "* 76 * , 6 ( 1996 ) ) , can be replaced by the condition @xmath441 that the trap potential is smooth on microscopic scales ( among which @xmath159 is shown to be maximal ) . however , if the regime of intermediate or strong correlations ( @xmath442 ) is considered and , simultaneously , if @xmath443 , the maximal characteristic microscopic length scale is @xmath141 rather than @xmath159 ( see above ) . in this case , the lda validity condition @xmath444 ( or @xmath297 , see above ) is more correct than the conditions @xmath439 and @xmath440 .",
    "in addition , we note that , at @xmath388 , the lda , rigorously speaking , can not be applied to the description of the vortex subsystem , because the scales related to vortices are large and are comparable with the trap size @xcite",
    ".          in interacting exciton systems at @xmath15 , the exciton resonance is redshifted by a quantity related to @xmath367 .",
    "this is due to that , at @xmath15 , upon exciton recombination , an elementary excitation is created from the ground state and acquires a portion of the energy .",
    "this differs from the case of an ideal gas at @xmath388 , when an exciton with the energy @xmath445 recombines and transfers all this energy to an emitted photon causing a blueshift .",
    "the latter scenario was observed in @xcite ."
