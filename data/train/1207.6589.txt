    "many galaxies , over the whole hubble sequence , show nucleated central regions often referred to as `` nuclear star clusters ''  ( nscs ) .",
    "these systems are among the densest star clusters observed , with effective radii of a few parsecs and central luminosities up to @xmath4  @xcite .",
    "the total frequency of nucleation is as large as @xmath5 for galaxies fainter than @xmath6 , while nscs tend to disappear in galaxies brighter than this magnitude .",
    "there is no consensus on how nscs form .",
    "a _ dissipative _ origin bases on the hypothesis of radial gas inflow into the galactic center and requires efficient dissipation mechanisms to work  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this model ,",
    "a nsc  consists mostly of stars that formed locally @xcite .",
    "alternatively , nscs could have a _",
    "origin in which massive stellar  ( globular - like ) clusters migrate to the center due to dynamical friction and merge to form a dense nucleus growing up to the size of observed nscs  @xcite .",
    "observations of nscs in de galaxies suggest that the majority of these systems could be the result of accumulating mass in the form of orbitally decayed globular clusters .",
    "numerical studies have also shown that such a formation model is consistent with the measured sizes and luminosities of nuclei  @xcite .",
    "in addition , stellar population synthesis studies of nsc spectra suggest that most of the mass usually resides in stars as old as typical globular clusters  ( @xmath7gyr ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . on the other hand",
    ", the observed correlation between colors and luminosities together with the complex star formation histories that often characterize the central region of galaxies , may be difficult to explain on the basis of a dissipationless origin , unless there is some contribution from continuous or recurrent star formation in addition to the ancient globular cluster stars  @xcite .",
    "this suggests that dissipation and dissipationless processes are not exclusive , and nscs might indeed originate from a combination of the two processes .",
    "due to their small sizes and their crowded stellar fields , galactic nuclei beyond the local group are typically unresolved , and the only quantities that can be determined are integrated properties such as half - mass radius and total luminosity . a radial density profile and velocity structure can be reliably determined only for the milky way  ( mw ) nsc  @xcite , which , due to its proximity  ( @xmath8kpc ) , can be resolved into individual stars  @xcite .",
    "in addition to the mw , ngc  205 also has a spatially - resolved nsc   ( figure  2 of * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the mw nsc has an estimated mass of @xmath9  @xcite and hosts a massive black hole  ( mbh ) whose mass , @xmath10 , is uniquely well determined  @xcite .",
    "a number of other galaxies also contain both a nsc  and a mbh  @xcite , that have comparable masses . in models of nscs , the dynamical influence of a mbh",
    "should therefore be considered , at least in bulges brighter than about @xmath11 which are believed to always contain a mbh  @xcite .",
    "more recently , we have presented large - scale @xmath12-body simulations of the inspiral and merger of massive clusters in the inner regions of the galaxy  @xcite .",
    "we showed that current observational constraints are consistent with the hypothesis that a large fraction of the mw nsc mass is in old stars brought in by infalling globular clusters . in this paper , we expand on this previous work and use simple analytical considerations to investigate the possibility that globular clusters can migrate through dynamical friction in the center of galaxies and form compact stellar nuclei . in particular , we focus on how the presence of mbhs at the center of galaxies can impact the merger hypothesis for the formation of their nsc . in order to highlight the role of mbhs in nsc  formation",
    ", we will systematically present our results for both cases of galaxy with and without central mbh .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start in  2 by comparing some of the observed scaling relations for nscs with the same relations predicted in both the merger and the gas model . in  3 and",
    " 4 we develop a simple analytical model for studying the orbital decay of globular clusters in galaxies like the mw , and explore the effect that a central mbh  in the galaxy has on the properties of the resulting nsc . in  5 we use an approach similar to that of  3 to follow the orbital evolution of globular clusters near massive mbhs in the central regions of bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "in  6 we discuss a variety of astrophysical implications of a dissipationless origin of nscs and conclude in  7 .",
    "the study of nscs has revealed a number of correlations between their masses and several global properties of their host galaxies , such as velocity dispersion and bulge mass .",
    "the existence of such correlations might indicate a direct link among large galactic spacial scales and the much smaller scale of the nuclear environment .",
    "while it was for long believed that nscs and mbhs followed similar scaling relations with their host galaxies  @xcite , it is now well established that ncs do not follow any of the scaling relations defined by mbhs  @xcite",
    ". observations also reveal that , unlike globular clusters , nsc  half - light radii are luminosity dependent , increasing with increasing total mass  @xcite .",
    "this relation might contain important information on the processes that shaped the central regions of galaxies and their nscs .",
    "we start here by comparing such observed correlations with predictions from both the dissipative and dissipationless formation models .      of the global - to - nucleus relations ,",
    "the most frequently referred to is the tight correlation between nsc  mass , @xmath14 , and the host galaxy s velocity dispersion , @xmath15 .",
    "@xcite argued that such a correlation has a slope which is consistent with that of the well - known @xmath16 relation obeyed by the mbh  mass , @xmath17 .",
    "more recently , a series of papers reached a different conclusion , suggesting that the nsc  scaling relations are instead substantially shallower than the corresponding mbh  scaling relations  @xcite .",
    "the version of the @xmath18 relation given in @xcite is @xmath19    we mention here that the @xmath18 relation might be a non - primary correlation , instead resulting from a projection of the fundamental plane , given the observed correlation between @xmath14 and the total host galaxy mass  ( @xmath20 ) : @xmath21  ( e.g. , see * ? ? ?",
    "a predicted @xmath18 relation can be easily derived in the globular cluster merger model if we assume that the globular cluster distribution initially follows the stellar light and by using an isothermal sphere density model : @xmath22 , where @xmath15 is the 1d velocity dispersion and @xmath23 the gravitational constant .",

    "since the term in square brackets in equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) is a constant , the globular cluster merger model predicts @xmath41 .    in the mw , the initial total number of globular clusters , @xmath42 ,",
    "can be recovered based on their observed luminosity function and semi - analytical modeling of mass - loss due to stellar evolution and due to tidal interaction with the galactic environment .",
    "@xcite derived a survival fraction of @xmath43 for a minimum initial cluster mass @xmath44 . assuming 100 present - day globular clusters we have that the total initial number of clusters in the galaxy is @xmath45 . considering only those gcs that are associated with the bulge on a hubble time , this gives @xmath46 , which compared to the total stellar mass of the bulge , @xmath47 , yields @xmath48 .",
    "we can rewrite equation  ( [ eq5 ] ) as @xmath49 despite its simplicity , our model reproduces the observed @xmath13 relation both in slope and normalization .",
    "@xcite proposed a nsc  in - situ star formation model regulated by momentum feedback .",
    "this model is an extension of the argument proposed by @xcite to explain the @xmath16 relation , and invokes the formation of a massive nuclear cluster due to gas inflow and accumulation at the center of the galaxy during the early phases of galaxy evolution .",
    "stellar winds and supernovae from a young nuclear cluster with a standard imf produce an outflow with momentum flux given by @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the eddington luminosity calculated by the stellar mass , @xmath52 is the speed of light , @xmath53 is related to the mass fraction of massive stars , and @xmath54 is the electron scattering opacity .",
    "the outflow is initially momentum conserving and produces an outward force on the gas in the bulge , whose weight is @xmath55 , with @xmath56 the enclosed gas mass and @xmath57 the total enclosed mass of the galaxy . for an isothermal potential",
    "one finds @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the baryonic mass fraction  @xcite . requiring that the momentum output produced by the nuclear cluster balances the weight of the gas leads to the relation @xmath60 a similar scaling relation can be derived in protogalaxies with non - isothermal dark matter halos  @xcite .",
    "this model is very attractive because it contains no free parameters .",
    "in addition , equation  ( [ eq7 ] ) is in good agreement with the @xmath13 correlation reported by @xcite : @xmath61 but , as previously mentioned , it is at odds with @xcite who finds nsc  scaling relations considerably shallower than the corresponding mbh  scaling relations .",
    "the difference between these two studies was due to the proper exclusion of nuclear disks in the sample of @xcite and the larger sample of nscs used in this latter work .",
    "for these reasons we consider the results of graham more robust and conclude that the mclaughlin et al .",
    "model provides a poor description of the observed @xmath13 correlation .",
    "this suggests that momentum feedback may be not relevant , which would be expected if the nscs originated elsewhere and were subsequently deposited into their host galaxy centers .",
    "the size of galactic nuclei clearly correlates with their luminosity , in the sense that brighter nscs have larger effective radii .",
    "the relation is approximately  @xcite @xmath63 where @xmath64 is the nsc  effective radius ( or half - mass radius ) and @xmath65 its total luminosity .",
    "this relation is consistent with the extrapolation of the @xmath66 relation for elliptical galaxies .      in the merger model the radius of the nucleus increases with increasing total mass as globular clusters merge .",
    "the brighter , larger mass nuclei are therefore predicted to be spatially very extended . @xcite used simple energy arguments to derive the size - mass relation for nscs in galaxies with no central mbh . for the sake of completeness we repeat this simple calculation in what follows .",
    "after a merger the nsc  energy , @xmath67 , equals the energy of the nucleus before the merger , @xmath68 , plus the energy brought in by the globular cluster : @xmath69 with @xmath70 the internal binding energy of the cluster , and @xmath71 its orbital energy before the merger .",
    "the equations above permit expressing the mass , energy , and radius of the nucleus recursively as @xmath72 where the subscript 1 denotes the initial nucleus , and , by assumption , @xmath73 .",
    "equations  ( [ rec1]-[rec3 ] ) imply @xmath74 at the time the mass of the nucleus is still comparable to the mass of the infalling clusters .",
    "after many mergers the nucleus is much more massive than one globular cluster and the relation steepens to @xmath75 .",
    "after 25 mergers , equations  ( [ rec1]-[rec3 ] ) imply @xmath76 .",
    "the half - mass radii of globular clusters are @xmath77pc @xcite , irrespective of their luminosity , so for a nucleus assembled from 25 mergers , @xmath78 pc .",
    "such a value is in reasonable agreement with the measured half - mass radii for the brightest nuclei .",
    "we conclude that a model that attributes the origin of nscs to the mergers of globular clusters at the centers of galaxies is consistent with the sizes and luminosities of the nuclei .    in a number of galaxies nscs",
    "are observed to coexist with mbhs .",
    "an example of such systems is the mw for which the mass of the nsc , @xmath79   @xcite , is somewhat comparable to the mass of the central black hole , @xmath80  @xcite .",
    "a mbh  will disrupt clusters that pass within the radius @xmath81 where @xmath82 is the one - dimensional velocity dispersion of a globular cluster , @xmath83 its core radius , @xmath84 is the velocity dispersion in the nsc  and @xmath85 is the influence radius of the mbh . in the presence of a mbh ,",
    "the dependence of the half - mass radius @xmath64 on @xmath14 is substantially weaker than the observed correlation , @xmath86  @xcite , due to the fact that the size of the nsc  is determined by the fixed tidal field from the mbh .",
    "when a stellar cluster is disrupted , stars that were initially within the cluster core will redistribute locally at a distance @xmath87 from the mbh .",
    "the density profile of the nsc  will therefore have a core of characteristic size @xmath88 .",
    "although the gas model remains somewhat more qualitative there are some indications that the observed @xmath62 relation might be difficult to reconcile with a purely dissipative scenario .",
    "@xcite performed fully self - consistent chemodynamical simulations to investigate how nscs can form through dissipative gas dynamics .",
    "he found that compact nuclei can be formed via dissipative , repeated merger of gaseous ( or stellar ) clumps that develop from nuclear gaseous spiral arms due to local gravitational instability .",
    "these computations showed that fainter nscs are likely to have a more diffuse configuration due to more negative feedback from sne  ii which in turn can prevent nscs from forming in faint galaxies .",
    "the fact that nsc  formation is more - strongly suppressed by stronger feedback effects in less - luminous galaxies would explain why brighter dwarf galaxies ( de ) are more likely to contain nscs  @xcite .",
    "however , simulations also show that more massive nscs are less extended than their lower mass counterparts , which is the opposite of the observed trend  ( see figure  15  of * ? ? ?",
    "further investigation of the above inconsistency is needed in order to determine how the results depend on the resolution limit of the simulations and on the adopted initial conditions .",
    "the above discussion gives some level of reliability to the hypothesis of a dissipationless , merging formation for nscs .",
    "we now wish to test whether the merger of globular clusters can result in a nsc  similar to that of the mw . as a first step one can derive the globular cluster parameters required to give a peak density , @xmath89 , equal to the observed density of the nsc  in the mw , and see whether such parameters are reasonable when compared to typical globular cluster properties .",
    "the stellar cluster central phase space density is given by @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the cluster core density .",
    "after inspiral , we require @xmath92 , or @xmath93 so that @xmath94    the observed nsc  density within @xmath95pc at the galactic center  ( gc ) is @xmath96  @xcite . comparing this with equation  ( [ e1 ] ) ,",
    "we obtain @xmath97    this crude calculation shows that for a mw - like galaxy , the globular cluster parameters required to give the observed peak density of the nsc  are quite reasonable .",
    "a simple analytical model is developed in what follows to evolve a population of stellar clusters subject to migration and dissolution in a galactic bulge and to calculate the influx of migrating clusters into the center of the galaxy . in this way we can address the possibility that a substantial fraction of the nsc  mass in galaxies like the mw could have been assembled through cluster migration and mergers .",
    "we assume that the central properties of a stellar cluster  ( i.e. @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) remain unchanged during inspiral and that @xmath98 , where @xmath99 is the cluster tidal  ( limiting ) radius given by  @xcite @xmath100 with @xmath101 the galactic potential , and @xmath102 a `` form factor '' that depends on the density distribution within the cluster .",
    "for a king model with a large central concentration , @xmath103 .",
    "equation  ( [ rtrking ] ) includes the tidal force due to the radial gradient in the galaxy potential , the centrifugal force from the cluster s orbit and assumes that the density of the cluster goes to zero roughly at the radius where the force acting to remove a star is balanced by the attracting force from the rest of the cluster .",
    "the tidal radius of a king model orbiting in a galaxy with a power - law density profile , @xmath104 , and containing a mbh  at its center , is @xmath105^{-1/2}~.\\ ] ] the radius at which the tidal force from the mbh  starts to dominate the tidal force from the stellar cusp ( in galaxies containing both ) is @xmath106 a king model also satisfies the relation : @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the truncated mass of the globular cluster whose radius is limited by the external tidal field .    given the cluster central velocity dispersion , equations  ( [ rtr2 ] ) and ( [ mt ] ) can be combined to evaluate , at any radius , the cluster mass permitted by the galaxy tidal field and the mass dispersed along the orbit .",
    "this corresponds to a density enhancement with respect to the galactic background of @xmath109 the resulting radial dependence of the density profile of stars in the growing nsc  is easily found to be @xmath110 steeper density cusps in the distribution of background stars give lower values of the density slope for the resulting nsc .",
    "larger values of @xmath17 also give smaller densities near the center since the cluster models start being truncated at larger radii and their mass is dispersed over larger spatial scales .",
    "these basic formalism assumes that mass loss from the clusters is entirely due to their interaction with the external tidal field and it omits mass loss  ( evaporation ) due to internal dynamics . since the only clusters that can contribute to the growth of a nsc   are",
    "very massive systems with relaxation times longer than their dynamical friction timescale this simplification is quite reasonable and does not alter our results in any important way .",
    "however , dynamical evaporation due to internal dynamics is also accounted for , in the sense that we do not follow the evolution of clusters which are disrupted ( evaporated ) on timescales shorter than the relevant dynamical friction timescales .",
    "luminosity profiles of galaxies are well approximated by power laws with @xmath130 at radii smaller than the effective radius of the stellar spheroid  ( @xmath131 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . since for mw - like galaxies the only clusters that can reach the gc in one hubble time are those initially at @xmath132  @xcite , and that within these radii the baryonic matter dominates the galactic potential , we represent the galaxy bulge by using a simple power - law density model : @xmath133 , with @xmath134  , for @xmath135 . ]",

    "the scale length @xmath139 , is related to the bulge effective radius via  @xmath140 for @xmath141 .",
    "we assume that the clusters have initially the same distribution of stars in the galaxy  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and we assign their masses using the cluster initial mass function  ( cimf ) , @xmath142  @xcite , and limiting mass values of @xmath143 ; @xmath144 .    the fraction of all star formation that occurs in gravitationally bound stellar clusters is usually referred to as `` cluster formation efficiency '' .",
    "the cluster formation efficiency in the mw is @xmath145  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , in our model we assume that the total mass in clusters is initially @xmath146 .",
    "we start by identifying a  dissolution time \" for globular clusters due to dynamical evaporation as a function of their initial mass  @xcite : @xmath147 with @xmath148 , @xmath125 if the cluster is truncated , @xmath149 and @xmath150 the angular velocity at the galactocentric radius @xmath24 .",
    "we then remove clusters with total lifetime , @xmath151 , shorter than the dynamical friction time - scale , @xmath152 .",
    "this procedure reduces the initial total mass in globular clusters from @xmath153 to @xmath154 for @xmath155 , and to @xmath156 for @xmath157 . by comparing equation  ( [ tdf - sfc2 ] ) with equation  ( [ tdiss ] )",
    "one can easily show that if @xmath158 and @xmath159 initially , this latter condition remains satisfied during inspiral .",
    "we set the core radius of the globular clusters to be @xmath160pc , roughly equal to the median value of the core radii listed in the harris s compilation  @xcite of galactic globular clusters .",
    "if a cluster reached its tidal disruption radius its core mass is redistributed uniformly at the radius of disruption over a region of extent @xmath161pc .",
    "but we note that our results do not strongly depend on the particular value for this parameter , which only affects the nsc density profile at very small radii  ( @xmath162pc ) . within these central regions",
    "we expect that other dynamical processes  ( e.g. , two - body relaxation , mass segregation ) will modify the nsc density profile with respect to the simple predictions of our monte - carlo experiments  ( we discuss this point in more detail below ) .",
    "when a cluster enters the inner @xmath163pc , its mass was redistributed using a plummer sphere model of total mass  @xmath164 and core radius @xmath83 .",
    "in addition , we make the reasonable assumption that the distribution of field stars is constant when computing the relevant dynamical friction time - scales .",
    "given that the total mass in clusters is only @xmath165 of the bulge mass initially , the density profile of the galaxy at intermediate and large radii  ( @xmath166pc ;  e.g. , see figure  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and consequently the dynamical friction timescales are not significantly affected by such simplification . however , to approximately account for the mass that is progressively accumulated into the nucleus , the orbital decay of clusters was computed in order of increasing migration time ; then , for any inspiral , we added the quantity @xmath167 to the terms in square brackets in equation  ( [ rtr2 ] ) , with @xmath168 the accumulated mass within @xmath24 due to clusters with shorter orbital decay times .    finally , we computed the nsc  density at any radius by summing up the contribution , @xmath169 , of all clusters that within @xmath170yr reached that radius .",
    "after this time the total mass left in stellar clusters is @xmath171 , almost independent on the initial value of @xmath172 .",
    "the initial mass of the globular cluster system is therefore reduced from @xmath173 to @xmath174 of the total bulge mass after one hubble time due to dynamical dissolution of the less massive systems , and also due to massive clusters that inspiral into center of the galaxy and dissolve locally to form the stellar nucleus .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] gives the results of such calculations .    in agreement with @xcite",
    "we found that the mass of the forming nsc   is mostly ( @xmath175 ) composed of clusters with initial masses @xmath176 , suggesting that the low mass clusters scarcely contribute to nsc  formation in galaxies .",
    "instead , our results very much depend on the value of @xmath172 , since only very massive clusters can arrive in the central regions of the galaxy in a reasonable time without being destroyed by the galactic tidal forces in the process .    in galaxy models without a mbh ,",
    "nsc  formation is more efficient , and even for @xmath155 a nsc  forms in the central few parsecs of the galaxy .",
    "if a mbh  is present at the center of the galaxy , star clusters that come closer than @xmath177 from the center are disrupted and , as a result , the nsc  density is limited inside this radius  ( left panels in the figure  [ fig1 ] ) . for a mbh  mass of @xmath178 and @xmath155 ,",

    "we conclude that a scenario in which a large fraction of the mass of the milky way nsc is due to infalling globular clusters is in good agreement with current observational constraints .",
    "the results presented here should be interpreted with caution when comparing the detail of the nsc  density profile to observations .",
    "our modeling includes a series of simplifications that can have some impact on the inner structure of the resulting nsc .",
    "for example , consideration of the internal dynamics and mass spectrum in the globular clusters could enable mass segregation which can increase @xmath82 and then allow the cluster stars to reach much smaller radii .",
    "a realistic treatment of these effects will require careful @xmath12-body simulations and is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "nevertheless , we note that the results of our computations that include a central mbh  are very similar to those obtained in @xcite via @xmath12-body simulations . in both cases , the density profile that results after the final inspiral event",

    "in the previous sections we showed that nscs resulting from the accumulation of globular clusters around mbhs have lower central densities and larger cores than those forming in galaxies without mbhs . such a result is consistent with the results obtained using more sophisticated @xmath234body simulations  @xcite .",

    "whether nscs in other `` power - law '' galaxies will turn out to have stellar cores similar to that of the mw remains to be seen .",

    "in addition , it is not clear whether this picture would apply to elliptical , early - type galaxies which lack the large gas reservoirs of spirals , and thus should not experience frequent central starbursts .",
    "on the other hand , the fact that the nuclei formation histories were in part governed by local and dissipative factors is supported by a wide range of observational phenomena . as an example , the gas distribution and the kinematics of the gas in the nearby spiral ngc6946 suggest the presence of a central , small - scale , s - shaped stellar bar which appears to funnel gas towards the galaxy nucleus  ( within the inner @xmath7pc ) where about @xmath281 of molecular gas have been accumulated .",
    "star forming events triggered by the rapid inflow of gas in the center of the galaxy may then contribute to the growth of its nsc  @xcite .",
    "support to a dissipative origin is added by the fact that nscs in general tend to have a wide range of stellar ages , including young stellar populations  @xcite .",
    "our gc contains for instance a large population of young massive stars that most likely formed locally following the infall and fragmentation of a dense gaseous clump in the vicinity of sgr  a *  @xcite .",
    "such bursts may occur continuously over the age of the galaxy and thus produce a significant fraction of its nsc   mass .",
    "stellar population synthesis studies also show that the gc appears to have undergone continuous and recurrent star formation over the last @xmath282gyr , but it is not possible to fit the observations with ancient burst models , such as would be appropriate for an old population of stars that originated in globular clusters  @xcite .",
    "previous work incorrectly used the latter arguments to argue against a dissipationless origin for nscs  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "it is important to stress that although observations probe recent and episodic star formation they do not exclude that the bulk of the gc stellar population is in old stars .",
    "in fact , the gc luminosity function appears to be consistent with a star formation history in which a large fraction ( about 1/2 ) of the mass consists of old ( @xmath202  gyr ) stars and the remainder is due to continuous star formation  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , @xcite found that about 80 per cent of the stellar mass in the inner parsec of the galaxy is in old stars that formed more than @xmath283gyr ago .",
    "we add that , although globular clusters in our galaxy are exclusively old stellar systems  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , this might not be always the case in other galaxies .",
    "it is therefore not clear what fraction of the mass in nscs is contributed by local gaseous fragmentation .",
    "more investigation needs to be done in order to explore the implications of in - situ star formation as the origin of galactic nuclei .",
    "the morphology and kinematics of nscs are of great importance for understanding their origin  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "aspherical nscs are commonly observed in external galaxies .",
    "@xcite found that the three edge - on late - type galaxies ic  5052 , ngc  4206 and ngc  4244 have nuclei that are strongly elongated along the plane of their host galaxies disks .",
    "such clusters show evidence for multiple morphological components , with a disk - like young stellar population superimposed on an older more spherical component .",
    "the radial velocity map of the nucleus in ngc  4244 , the nearest of these three galaxies  ( @xmath284mpc ) , shows evidence for strong rotation , @xmath221 at @xmath282pc from the center , compared to a central velocity dispersion of @xmath285  @xcite .",
    "there is also evidence for flattening and rotation in the m33 nucleus  @xcite .",
    "the m33 nsc  is elongated along the major - axis of the galaxy and rotates at @xmath286 , while the central velocity dispersion is @xmath287  @xcite .",
    "the mw nsc  also appears to be rotating parallel to the overall galactic rotation  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , as a consequence of the strong interstellar extinction along the gc line of sight , our knowledge of the galactic nsc morphology and size remains very limited .",
    "is the observed rotation of nscs consistent with the predictions of a dissipationless model for nsc  formation ?",
    "of course if a large fraction of the nsc  mass was formed via accretion of clusters isotropically distributed throughout the galaxy , no net rotation would be expected , since there will not be any preferred direction for inspiral .",
    "if the primary formation process is instead gas accretion from the galactic disk , this would naturally explain both the flattening and the fact that nscs rotate parallel to their host galaxy rotation .    although young and rotating components of nscs might be difficult to reconcile with a globular cluster origin ( due to the long time scale for inspiral compared to the ages of the stars ) , we believe that the evidence for nsc  rotation alone , at least in late - type galaxies , is not a strong argument against a dissipationless origin . for instance , clusters falling into the gc could have originated in the inner part of the galactic disk and they will therefore share in its rotation  @xcite .",
    "another possibility is that globular clusters crossing the galactic disk experience a greater frictional force from the increased local stellar / gas density  @xcite and hence they can be dragged down into the disk plane and transported into the central region of the galaxy where they then accumulate to form a dense nucleus . in either case",
    ", the forming nsc  will appear to rotate in the same sense of the galaxy .",
    "these hypotheses lead to basic predictions that might be testable with future observations ; specifically : ( i )  nscs in early - type galaxies , which do not have extended massive disk - like structures , might have slower rotation with respect to nscs of spiral galaxies .",
    "( ii )  there should be some mild depletion of stellar clusters in the galactic disk as compared to off the disk plane  .",
    "in conclusion , comparing kinematic data with simulations for distinguishing between gas and cluster accretion may be difficult , since the detailed structure of simulated nscs varies in an important way with the orbital initial configuration of the infalling clusters .",
    "future observational work should be able to provide more reliable models for the spatial distribution of globular clusters near the center of galaxies , where timescales for infall are reasonably short .",

    "* ) ; the number of globular clusters predicted to inspiral would be then @xmath289 .",
    "this suggests that the lack of nscs in the fainter spheroidals could be simply a consequence of the arbitrarily long sinking timescales of stellar clusters in these systems .",

    "dissipationless formation modes produce relations that are substantially shallower than the corresponding mbh   scaling relations and are therefore more consistent with observations . *",
    "the globular cluster merger model , in the absence of a central mbh , naturally reproduces the observed relation between the size of galactic nuclei and their total luminosity , @xmath1 . when a mbh  is present , the dependence of the nsc  radius on its mass is substantially weaker than the observed relation because the size of the nsc   is mainly determined by the fixed tidal field of the mbh .",
    "* we derived explicit expressions for the orbits of globular clusters owing to dynamical friction and subject to mass - loss due to their tidal interaction with the galaxy  ( equation  [ sfc2 ] ) or with a central mbh  ( equation  [ rvst ] ) .",
    "these expressions were used to ( i )  address the possibility that nscs in galaxies similar to the mw could have been assembled via cluster migration and mergers ; and ( ii )  to follow the orbital evolution of globular clusters in the core of bright elliptical galaxies .",
    "* nscs that form through the mergers of globular clusters have a density profile characterized by a parsec - scale core and an envelope that falls off as @xmath183 .",
    "these properties are similar to those of the mw nsc .",
    "a nsc  with mass comparable to that of the mw nsc  is obtained by assuming an initial total mass in stellar clusters which is consistent with the cluster formation efficiency inferred from observational studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds  ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) . *",
    "a pre - existing mbh  at the center of the stellar spheroid has a strong impact on the structure of the growing stellar nucleus  ( figure  [ fig2 ] ) .",
    "tidal stresses from a mbh   disrupt the clusters when they pass within their tidal disruption radius , @xmath177 , limiting the density within that radius .",
    "hence , the density profile of the resulting nsc  will also have core size of @xmath88 . removing the mbh  from the galaxy",
    "allows the stellar clusters to keep their inner structure almost unchanged leading to the formation of a nsc  with higher peak densities .",
    "we find that separating the contribution of the nucleus from that of the galaxy could more difficult in stellar spheroids with more massive mbhs .",
    "* for globular clusters orbiting in the core of a massive elliptical galaxy like m87 , the timescale to reach the center is much longer than one hubble time  ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the essential reason for this is that the phase - space density of a shallow density cusp of stars around a mbh  falls to zero at low energies : inside the galaxy core there are no stars at any radius that move slower than the local circular velocity .",
    "the standard chandrasekhar s formula predicts little or even no frictional force in this case .",
    "in addition , when a mbh  is included , the tidal field near @xmath291 becomes much stronger , resulting in faster mass loss and fewer stars deposited to the center .",
    "based on these facts , we conclude the presence of central mbhs might inhibit the formation of compact nuclei in the brightest galaxies , in agreement with what is observed .",
