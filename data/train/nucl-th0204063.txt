    "<S> owing to progress of experimental techniques , information concerning the excited states of light unstable nuclei has increased rapidly . </S>",
    "<S> clustering structures should be one of the essential features in unstable nuclei as well as in stable nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> however , the characteristics of clustering in unstable nuclei are still mysterious . </S>",
    "<S> do clustering structures often appear in the excited states of general light unstable nuclei ? searching for exotic clustering structures and other new - type clusters than the well - known @xmath6 cluster is the focus in studies of the excited states of light unstable nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the clustering structures of unstable nuclei are one of the attractive and important subjects in experimental and theoretical research .    </S>",
    "<S> theoretical studies on @xmath7be @xcite have suggested molecule - like structures in the @xmath8 band and in the excited @xmath9 band . </S>",
    "<S> other candidates of clustering structures are the excited states of @xmath0be observed recently in the inelastic scattering reactions @xcite and in break - up reactions into @xmath3he+@xmath3he and @xmath4he+@xmath10he channels @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , fully microscopic calculations have not yet been done for these states of @xmath0be . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting feature of @xmath0be is a vanishing of the neutron magic number @xmath11 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> if the ground state is an intruder state , where are the normal states with closed neutron - shell configurations ? </S>",
    "<S> it is important to solve the relation between the intruder ground state and the possible clustering states within one microscopic framework in order to systematically investigate the structures of @xmath0be . </S>",
    "<S> our first aim is to study the ground and excited states of @xmath0be with a microscopic method . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , it is a challenge to theoretically search light neutron - rich nuclei ( @xmath1be and @xmath2b ) for new clustering states with exotic clusters    we have applied a microscopic method of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) . </S>",
    "<S> the amd methods have already proved to be a powerful approach for structure studies of general light nuclei @xcite because of the flexibility of the wave functions , which can express various kinds of structures from spherical shell - model - like structures to developed clustering structures . </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to systematically investigate the ground and excited states of light nuclei with a new version : a variation after spin - parity projections ( vap ) of amd , which was proposed by the author @xcite . as for theoretical predictions with this method </S>",
    "<S> , the predicted @xmath12 and @xmath13 states of @xmath7be with developed clustering structures @xcite have actually been discovered in recent experiments @xcite .    in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we have studied the structures of the ground and excited states of @xmath0be and compared the theoretical results with the experimental data . </S>",
    "<S> we theoretically searched @xmath1be and @xmath2b for unknown excited states with new clustering structures . in the results for @xmath1be and @xmath2b , </S>",
    "<S> the prediction of new rotational bands of exotic clustering structures are presented . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the mechanism of clustering development and the origin of the formation of @xmath3he clusters .    </S>",
    "<S> an amd wave function is a slater determinant of gaussian wave packets :    @xmath14 , \\label{eqn : single}\\\\ \\chi_{i}= \\left(\\begin{array}{l } { 1\\over 2}+\\xi_{i}\\\\ { 1\\over 2}-\\xi_{i } \\end{array}\\right ) , \\end{array}\\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the centers of gaussians @xmath15 s are complex variational parameters . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 is an intrinsic spin function parameterized by @xmath17 , which is also a variational parameter specifying the direction of the intrinsic spin of the @xmath18th nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is an isospin function which was fixed to be up ( proton ) or down ( neutron ) in the present calculations . </S>",
    "<S> we varied the parameters @xmath15 and @xmath17(@xmath20 ) to minimize the energy expectation value for the spin - parity eigenstate ( vap calculations ) , @xmath21 where the operator of total - angular - momentum projection ( @xmath22 ) is @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> the integration for the euler angle @xmath24 was calculated numerically . </S>",
    "<S> we adopted a frictional cooling method @xcite to obtain the minimum energy states . here </S>",
    "<S> , we represent the intrinsic amd wave function as @xmath25 , that was obtained by a vap calculation for the lowest state with a given spin parity of @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> higher excited states were constructed by varying the energy of the orthogonal components to the lower states by superposing wave functions . more details of the amd method for the excited states with the variation after spin - parity projection are described in refs @xcite . by performing vap calculations for the lowest and the higher excited states with various sets of total spin and parity @xmath27 </S>",
    "<S> , we obtained many amd wave functions @xmath28 , each of which approximately represents the intrinsic state of the corresponding @xmath29 state . </S>",
    "<S> the final results were attained by diagonalizing a hamiltonian matrix , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we applied the amd method for the excited states of @xmath0be , @xmath1be and @xmath2b . </S>",
    "<S> the adopted interactions in the present work were the central force of the modified volkov no.1 with case 3 @xcite , the spin - orbit force of g3rs @xcite and the coulomb force . </S>",
    "<S> the majorana parameter used here was @xmath32 , and the strength of g3rs force was chosen to be @xmath33 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we choose an optimum width parameter ( @xmath34 ) for the gaussians of the single - particle wave functions of each nucleus .    </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical results of the binding energies of @xmath0be , @xmath1be and @xmath2b are 61.9 mev , 59.7 mev and 73.1 mev , which underestimate the experimental values : 68.65 mev , 69.77 mev , 88.19 mev , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the smaller values of the binding energies in the present results than the experimental data can be improved by changing the majorana parameter of the interaction small to be @xmath35 . with this parameter , </S>",
    "<S> the binding energy of @xmath1be is 67.7 mev . in spite of the smaller values of binding energies , we adopt the parameter @xmath32 in the present work , because this parameter gives a good reproduction of parity inversion of @xmath36be , which should be important to well describe the ground - state properties of neighboring nucleus : @xmath0be . </S>",
    "<S> we have checked that the change of @xmath37 parameter has no significant effect on the excitation energy @xmath38 of @xmath1be , at least . </S>",
    "<S> namely , the calculated values of @xmath38 in the cases @xmath35 and @xmath32 are 4.2 mev and 4.4 mev , respectively .    in the calculated results for @xmath0be with amd , many excited states appear in the low - energy region . </S>",
    "<S> the energy levels of @xmath0be are presented in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : be12spe ] . </S>",
    "<S> the theoretical levels of the @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 states correspond well to the recently observed excited states @xcite . by analyzing the intrinsic amd wave functions </S>",
    "<S> , we can classify the excited states into rotational bands , such as @xmath42 . </S>",
    "<S> it is surprising that the newly observed levels @xcite at an energy region above 10 mev belong to the third rotational band , @xmath43 , which is a @xmath44 excited state with a well - developed clustering structure . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , there are many low - lying positive - parity states which belong to the lower rotational bands , @xmath45 and @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> even though @xmath0be has a neutron magic number of 8 , the intrinsic state of the ground @xmath47 state is not an ordinary state with a closed neutron @xmath48-shell , but a prolately deformed state with a developed clustering structure . </S>",
    "<S> the deformed ground state is dominated by another @xmath49 configuration than that in the @xmath50 state . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the ground @xmath51 band starts from the ground @xmath47 state and reaches the band terminal at the @xmath41 state . </S>",
    "<S> the rotational bands , @xmath43 and @xmath52 , share the same band terminal state because the terminal @xmath53 state is the highest spin state in the @xmath44 configurations . on the other hand , the main components of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 states are the @xmath56 configuration with a closed neutron @xmath48-shell , and construct the second @xmath46 band .    for experimental evidence , the strength of the @xmath57 decay from @xmath0be(0@xmath58 ) to @xmath0b(@xmath59 ) is helpful to estimate the breaking of the neutron @xmath48-shell @xcite . as expected , the theoretical value of @xmath60 is sufficiently small as the experimental data , @xmath61 , because the component of the @xmath44 configurations in the parent @xmath0be(0@xmath58 ) makes the transition matrix of the gamov - teller operator to be small . </S>",
    "<S> such a result is consistent with pioneer work @xcite , where their treatments were not fully microscopic for the freedom of all nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated value of @xmath62 from @xmath63 to @xmath64 is 0.02 @xmath65@xmath66 , which agrees reasonably with the experimental large value , @xmath62 = 0.05 @xmath65@xmath66 @xcite . as for the @xmath67 transition strength , </S>",
    "<S> the predicted values in the present results are @xmath68 = 14 @xmath65fm@xmath10 and @xmath70 = 8 @xmath65fm@xmath10 , which indicate a larger value of the @xmath67 transition strength in the deformed @xmath71 band than that in the @xmath9 band .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be pointed out that this is the first theoretical work which systematically reproduces the energy levels of all spin - assigned states discovered recently , except for the @xmath72 state . </S>",
    "<S> although the excitation energy of the @xmath72 state is overestimated by theory , we regard the theoretical @xmath63 state as being the measured @xmath72 state at 2.68 mev because of the large @xmath62 value . </S>",
    "<S> a theoretical discovery in the present calculations is the @xmath73 rotational band with the developed @xmath74he+@xmath3he clustering structure , which constructs the @xmath50 , @xmath75 , @xmath39 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 states . </S>",
    "<S> the developed clustering in the @xmath50 state gradually weakens with increasing total - angular momenta ( @xmath76 ) , and finally it changes to a spin - aligned state at @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> many excited states in the rotational bands @xmath77 and @xmath72 are predicted to exist in the low - energy region with an excitation energy below 10 mev .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.45    by analyzing the single - particle wave functions in the intrinsic state , the deformation mechanism of the ground state can be understood by the idea of molecular orbits surrounding 2@xmath6 cores . </S>",
    "<S> although the molecular orbits in be isotopes have been studied theoretically @xcite , one of the important points of the present results is that the development of a @xmath78 structure in the ground state of @xmath0be can be confirmed without assuming the existence of clusters . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the third @xmath47 state seems to be a @xmath3he+@xmath3he clustering structure instead of the @xmath6 and surrounding neutrons in molecular orbits , because the distance between two clusters is too large . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , an @xmath6 cluster goes outward far enough to form a @xmath3he cluster with 2 valence neutrons .    </S>",
    "<S> we next present the results for @xmath1be . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig : be14spe ] shows the energy levels of positive - parity states of @xmath1be obtained by vap calculations . although few excited states are experimentally known , many excited states are predicted based on the theoretical results . </S>",
    "<S> there are a few candidates of levels above the threshold energy ( 9.1 mev excitation ) for separation into @xmath4he+@xmath3he in break - up experiments @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.45    the excited states in the region @xmath79 are classified into 3 rotational bands : @xmath71 , @xmath9 and @xmath80 . in most of the states in @xmath1be , </S>",
    "<S> 2-@xmath6 cores are formed in the calculated results , although no clusters are assumed in the model . because of the 2-@xmath6 cores , the @xmath64 and @xmath54 states have prolate deformations with deformation parameters of @xmath81 and @xmath82 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> the latter one with a large deformation constructs the @xmath46 rotational band , which reaches the @xmath83 state . by analyzing the single - particle wave functions of the intrinsic states </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the states in the @xmath71 and @xmath80 bands are dominated by the normal @xmath56 configurations , while the largely deformed states in @xmath46 mainly contain @xmath84-@xmath85 states with @xmath44 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the unique result of @xmath1be is innovative clustering structures of the excited states in this second @xmath46 band . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic states of @xmath46 band have spatially developed @xmath4he+@xmath3he clustering state , where both clusters are , themselves , very neutron - rich nuclei . in figure </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : be14](a ) for the contour surface for the matter density , @xmath86 0.16 nucleons/@xmath87 , of the intrinsic state of the @xmath54 state , the @xmath4he(@xmath3he ) cluster can be clearly recognized in the right(left)-handed side .    in order to understand the origin of @xmath4he+@xmath3he clustering formation , it is valuable to inspect the single - particle behavior of the valence neutrons . </S>",
    "<S> as mentioned above , the @xmath4he+@xmath3he clustering state in the @xmath46 band comes from the @xmath84-@xmath85 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> according to analyses of the single - particle energies and wave functions , the highest 4 neutron orbits correspond to two kinds of spatial orbits , which are associated with the @xmath88-mixing orbits in the deformed system . roughly speaking , </S>",
    "<S> each of two kinds of spatial orbits is occupied by a spin - up neutron and a spin - down neutron . </S>",
    "<S> figures [ fig : be14](b ) and [ fig : be14](c ) present the higher @xmath88-like orbit and the lower @xmath88-like orbit , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> they contain more than 80% components of the positive parity states . </S>",
    "<S> if we call the longitudinal direction of the prolate deformation as the @xmath89-axis , the highest nucleon orbit seen in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : be14](b ) originates from the @xmath88-orbit with a form of @xmath90 $ ] . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the spatial orbit for the lower one is similar to the orbit of @xmath91 $ ] , which deforms along the @xmath89-axis , as shown in fig.[fig : be14](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> the original @xmath88-orbits are modified because of the deformation in @xmath1be . </S>",
    "<S> the deformed neutron orbits are stabilized by 2 stretched pairs of protons , because the orbits gain their kinetic energies with respect to the nodes along the @xmath89-axis . from the viewpoint of single - particle orbits , the @xmath3he cluster in the @xmath3he+@xmath4he clustering system consists of 4 neutrons in the @xmath88-orbits and 2 protons in the @xmath48-orbits . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the formation of @xmath3he cluster originates from the correlation of 4 neutrons in the @xmath88-orbits and 2 protons in the @xmath48-orbits . </S>",
    "<S> once a @xmath3he cluster takes shape , the cluster spatially develops out of the core - cluster @xmath4he keeping the stability of the modified @xmath88-mixing orbits in the deformed system . </S>",
    "<S> unique points of this idea are as follows . </S>",
    "<S> firstly , correlations of more than 4 nucleons have not been found . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath3he cluster is related to 6-nucleon correlations ( 4 neutrons with 2 protons ) . </S>",
    "<S> second , the nucleons , which compose a cluster out of the core nucleus , rise over 2 shells ( @xmath88-shell and @xmath48-shell in this case ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is unusual in light stable nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> the third point is that the spatially clustering development is associated with the stability of the single - particle orbits of the system . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest one of the novel feature that 4 neutrons with 2 protons correlate to form a developed @xmath3he cluster in neutron - rich nuclei .    </S>",
    "<S> = 0.45    in the results concerning the excited states of @xmath2b , the situation is similar to that of @xmath1be . </S>",
    "<S> we find an exotic clustering structure with @xmath5li+@xmath3he in the second @xmath92 band , which starts from the @xmath93 state at about 7 mev higher than the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic structure of the @xmath92 band consists of two exotic clusters:@xmath5li and @xmath3he clusters , which develop as remarkably as those in the @xmath46 band of @xmath1be . </S>",
    "<S> these excited states with @xmath5li+@xmath3he clustering are based on @xmath44 configurations . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial parts of 4 valence neutrons in @xmath88-like orbits are very similar to those of @xmath1be presented in figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : be14](b ) and [ fig : be14](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is an interesting problem whether or not the @xmath3he - cluster may appear in the excited states of other neutron - rich nuclei than @xmath1be and @xmath2b .    </S>",
    "<S> although particle decay widths are important for the stability of the excited states , the widths were not considered in the present calculations , which were performed within a bound state approximation . </S>",
    "<S> the widths for the particle decays should be carefully discussed using other frameworks , such as a method with a reduced width amplitude , or a complex scaling method beyond the present amd framework . </S>",
    "<S> we just mention the partial widths of the states into he channels in the @xmath46 of @xmath1be . </S>",
    "<S> when the excitation energies are above the threshold energy , 12.2 mev , the excited states in @xmath46 of @xmath1be may decay into @xmath4he+@xmath3he channel . by assuming @xmath4he and @xmath3he clusters in su(3 ) limits , we estimated the partial decay width of @xmath40 and @xmath83 into @xmath4he(0@xmath94)+@xmath3he(0@xmath94 ) channel to be 6 kev and 50 kev , respectively , by calculating the reduced width amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> for the total width , it is required to carefully study the excitation energies and other decay channels , such as neutron decays and excited he cluster decays .    in summary , we studied the structure of the excited states of @xmath0be , @xmath1be and @xmath2b based on the framework of the amd method . </S>",
    "<S> this is the first microscopic calculation to systematically reproduce the energy levels of all the spin - assigned states in @xmath0be , except for the @xmath72 state . </S>",
    "<S> one of the discoveries of the present results is the third @xmath51 band with @xmath3he+@xmath3he clusters , which corresponds well to recently observed states in the break - up reactions . in @xmath1be and @xmath2be , we predicted low - lying excited states with innovative clustering structures . </S>",
    "<S> namely , new types of clusters , @xmath4he+@xmath3he and @xmath95li+@xmath3he , were found in the excited states of @xmath1be and @xmath2be , respectively . in these well - developed clustering structures with 2@xmath96 excited configurations , </S>",
    "<S> the mechanism of the @xmath3he cluster development was discussed in relation to the single - particle picture . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the 6-nucleon correlation among 4 neutrons and 2 protons plays an important role in the formation of @xmath3he cluster . </S>",
    "<S> the results suggest an important feature , that an exotic clustering structure may very often exist in the excited states of neutron - rich nuclei .    </S>",
