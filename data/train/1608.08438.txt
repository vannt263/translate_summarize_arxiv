    "difference equations , as axiomatized by acfa , are not stable , nor does the geometry of finite dimensional sets satisfy the ` dimension theorem ' : the intersection of two such sets may have unexpectedly low dimension . for instance , the naive intersection of two surfaces in 3-space over the fixed field of the automorphism @xmath0 could be two lines interchanged by @xmath0 ; within the fixed field their intersection point would be the only solution . both of these pathologies are ameliorated as one relaxes @xmath0 to @xmath1 ( going from the equation @xmath2 to @xmath3 . ) at the limit , one has a _ virtual structure _ , defined and studied in @xcite ; under appropriate conditions , this structure is stable and the dimension theorem is valid . using a generalization of the zariski geometries of @xcite , one can then deduce a _ trichotomy theorem _ :",
    "any difference equation may be analyzed via a tower of equations over fixed fields and equations of locally modular type .",
    "+ these results were earlier proved in characteristic zero in a quite different way in @xcite , relying strongly on ramification divisors .",
    "the trichotomy lies at the heart of applications to diophantine geometry such as @xcite ( in characteristic zero ) , @xcite ( in positive characteristic ) and @xcite ( in any characteristic ) . + in 2015 , however , tom scanlon s berkeley seminar recognized a problem with a key lemma , 3.7 .",
    "we show below how to prove a somewhat weaker version of this lemma : the wrong lemma  3.7 asserted a unique component through a point , the corrected version , proposition [ lem37 ] , asserts finitely many , and moreover the finite number is at most the degree of the normalization of the relevant variety in the base .",
    "all the main results of the paper remain valid with the same set of ideas , but considerable reorganization is required .",
    "one role of the present paper is to provide a lengthy erratum , explaining in detail how this may be done .",
    "parts of this paper are thus technical and need to be read in conjunction with @xcite .",
    "however section 2 , which contains the main correction , is self - contained , in the sense of quoting some results from @xcite but not requiring entering into their proofs .",
    "+ at the same time , we take the opportunity to present a setting ( ` prepared equations ' ) in which the limit structure is equivalent to an ordinary structure , in the sense that the associated algebraic object is an ordinary ring with its periodic ideals , rather than an abstract limit of such rings as in the virtual case",
    ". results of @xcite imply that this setting , while not fully general , suffices to coordinatize all difference equations .",
    "it may be of interest for other applications , in particular the study of limit structures for more equations that are not necessarily algebraic over su - rank one .",
    "+ we expect that a trichotomy theorem can be proved for zariski geometries based on robinson structures .",
    "this has so far been worked out only in special cases ; the most general treatment is contained in the unpublished phd thesis of elsner @xcite .",
    "consequently the trichotomy follows from the basic prepared case alone , though this is not the case for some of the other results : for finer statements such as a description of the fields definable in the limit structures , both in @xcite and here , we use additional features of the specific structure .",
