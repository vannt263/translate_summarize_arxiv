    "a classical technique for constructing quadratic number fields with class number divisible by @xmath5 is studying integral solutions of the equation @xmath7 for each integral point @xmath8 we can form the ideal @xmath9 in the ring of integers of @xmath10 ; the ideal @xmath11 has norm @xmath12 and satisfies @xmath13 , hence generates an ideal class of order dividing @xmath5 .",
    "it seems that p. joubert @xcite was the first to observe that a class of prime order @xmath5 in the group of binary quadratic forms with negative discriminant @xmath3 implies the solvability of the equation ( [ yamamoto ] ) ; joubert used techniques from the theory of complex multiplication for exploiting this observation .",

    "these results explain the success of yamamoto s approach , and at the same time raise a few new problems that we do not yet fully understand .",
    "the rational points on the surface lying on the hyperplane @xmath19 form ( the affine part of ) a hyperelliptic curve @xmath20 ; in the case @xmath21 , this is an elliptic curve .",
    "although the integral points on @xmath22 do not form a group in general , it was observed by buell @xcite and soleng @xcite that the integral points on @xmath22 ( and , more generally , certain rational points satisfying some technical conditions ) give ideal classes of order dividing @xmath23 in such a way that the map from @xmath22 to the @xmath23-class group respects the group law on the elliptic curve , i.e. , that collinear points get mapped to classes whose product is trivial .",
