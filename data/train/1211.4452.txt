    "although the standard model ( sm ) of particle physics agrees very well with various experimental results , some problems and unsatisfactory points have also been pointed out .",
    "one of them is the lack of a guiding principle ruling the flavor structure of fermions . in this regard ,",
    "the introduction of flavor symmetries is one of the most conceivable extensions of the sm and also well motivated from a viewpoint of string theories @xcite .",
    "since , as concluded in ref .",
    "@xcite , most of flavor symmetries need to be broken either spontaneously or explicitly at energy scales much above the electroweak scale , it is usually not easy to decide which symmetries are suitable and how they should be imposed . to this end",
    ", one needs to find out remnants of such broken symmetries in a low energy lagrangian , and small parameters could be important for this purpose .",
    "if symmetry breaking was slight , its effects should correspondingly be small , yielding small breaking terms in a low energy lagrangian .",
    "moreover , even if they were grossly broken , the breaking effects might be realized as effective non - renormalizable operators suppressed by their breaking scales . for instance , it is well known that a majorana neutrino mass term can be constructed with only the sm particles at mass - dimension five @xcite : @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 represent the left - handed lepton and the sm higgs doublets , respectively , and that the lepton number conservation is violated with this term . in this case",
    ", this term can be regarded as a breaking term of the lepton number symmetry broken at the high energy scale @xmath8 .",
    "hence , it might be said that small parameters in a low energy theory are the manifestation of new symmetries in high energies ; zero limits of the small parameters may correspond to the unbroken limits of the associated symmetries .    in the case of flavor symmetries",
    ", their remnants should appear in the fermion mass terms and/or the flavor mixing sectors .",
    "for example , one can line up the following candidates of small parameters :    1 .",
    "@xmath9  ( or  @xmath10 ) , 2 .",
    "@xmath11  ( or  @xmath12 ) , 3 .",
    "@xmath13 , 4 .",
    "@xmath14 , 5 .",
    "@xmath15  ( or  @xmath16 ) ,    where @xmath17 and @xmath18 stand for the mixing angles of the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) , @xmath19 , and the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) , @xmath20 , mixing matrices , respectively ; @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 denotes masses of the up - type quarks , down - type quarks , charged leptons and neutrinos .",
    "the first two items have attracted a lot of attention over the years as they predict the @xmath24 permutation symmetry @xcite or non - abelian discrete flavor symmetries @xcite in the limit of @xmath25 with @xmath26 .",
    "in fact a number of models based on these symmetries have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the recent reactor @xcite and long - baseline @xcite neutrino oscillation experiments , however , disfavor the vanishing @xmath4 : the daya - bay experiment @xcite give us @xmath27 deviations from @xmath25 with a rather large central value of @xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , considerable deviations of @xmath29 from @xmath30 have also been found in the global analysis of the neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite , yet its confidence level is not high enough to conclude . having these facts in mind , we would turn our attention to the remaining three items and discuss their consequences in the present study .",
    "first , the third item means quasi mass degeneracy between the first and second generation neutrinos unless @xmath31 is much smaller than @xmath32 in the case of normal mass ordering .",
    "let us focus on this partially quasi - degenerated region ( roughly @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the normal and inverted ordering cases , respectively ) and consider the effective majorana neutrino mass operator given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : wein ] ) . in the limit of @xmath35 ,",
    "the majorana neutrino mass matrix comes to respect a two - dimensional rotation symmetry @xcite , such as @xmath0 , @xmath36 and @xmath1 : @xmath37 in other words , @xmath38 and @xmath39 belong to a doublet representation , e.g. @xmath40 , of the symmetry , while @xmath41 behaves as a singlet representation , e.g. @xmath42 .",
    "( notations of @xmath0 are given in appendix . )",
    "then , the observed slight mass splitting between @xmath31 and @xmath32 could be interpreted as slight breaking of the rotation symmetry . like this",
    ", the observed neutrino mass spectrum could be explained by starting from a limit of @xmath43 .",
    "secondly , the idea of the partial mass degeneracy ( @xmath44 ) , however , seems to conflict with the fourth item because the charged lepton masses are strongly hierarchical .",
    "nevertheless , it is possible to realize a hierarchical mass spectrum in the case of dirac fermions by assigning a different doublet representation , @xmath45 , or a singlet representation @xmath42 to the right - handed charged leptons , resulting in @xmath46 respectively .",
    "it can be readily observed that the electron and muon masses are vanishing and thus degenerate in both cases . in this sense , the idea of the partial mass degeneracy may be applicable to not only the charged lepton sector but also the quark sectors .",
    "rather , that appears reasonable since one can relate the smallness of the light charged fermion masses with symmetry breaking . also , it may enable us to naturally understand some phenomenological relations among elements of the ckm matrix @xcite .",
    "lastly , given the above conjectures , the fifth item may naturally be explained at the same time .",
    "breaking of the rotation symmetry triggers flavor mixing as well . on one hand , in the quark and charged lepton sectors , small flavor mixings are expected because breaking terms are supposed to be small ; thus the observed small ckm mixing would be derived is a little larger than the others . ] . on the other hand , in the neutrino sector , its flavor mixing can be large since the leading - order neutrino mass matrix in eq .",
    "( [ eq : mnu0 ] ) is almost proportional to the unit matrix in the neutrino mass regions under consideration .",
    "we here stress that the mysterious differences between the ckm and pmns matrices stem from the nature of fermions , that is to say dirac or majorana , in this scenario .",
    "to summarize , the limit of the partial mass degeneracy seems to fit the observed fermion mass spectra and mixing patterns and suggests the existence of a two - dimensional rotation symmetry . yet another motivation to consider the partial mass degeneracy is that the effective mass , @xmath47 , of the neutrinoless double beta decay is not vanishing even in the case of normal mass ordering . in fig .",
    "[ fig:0nbb ] , we depict the allowed regions of @xmath47 as a function of the lightest neutrino mass in the standard @xmath48 framework , where 3@xmath49 constraints of the neutrino oscillation parameters from @xcite are imposed while varying cp phases from @xmath50 to @xmath51 . for example , if @xmath52 , then @xmath53 , which would be accessible by the next generation exo and kamland - zen experiments @xcite . in addition , the sensitivity of cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) observations on the neutrino mass has just started to enter this mass region @xcite .",
    "thus , it should be worthwhile to carry out theoretical studies on this mass region .    in sect .",

    "we here adopt @xmath1 as our flavor symmetry just to avoid dangerous massless nambu - goldstone bosons or gauge anomalies .",

    "<S> inspired by the small mass - squared difference measured in the solar neutrino oscillation experiments and by the testability , we suggest that a limit of the partial mass degeneracy , in which masses of the first two generation fermions are degenerate , may be a good starting point for understanding the observed fermion mass spectra and mixing patterns . </S>",
    "<S> the limit indicates the existence of a two - dimensional rotation symmetry , such as @xmath0 , @xmath1 and so on , in flavor space of the first two generations . </S>",
    "<S> we propose simple models for the lepton sector based on @xmath1 and show that the models can successfully reproduce the experimental data without imposing unnatural hierarchies among dimensionless couplings , although at least @xmath2 tuning is necessary in order to explain a large atmospheric mixing . </S>",
    "<S> it is especially found that the @xmath3 subgroup of the @xmath1 symmetry plays an important role in understanding the smallness of the electron mass and @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we also discuss testability of the models by the future neutrinoless - double - beta - decay experiments and cosmological observations . </S>"
