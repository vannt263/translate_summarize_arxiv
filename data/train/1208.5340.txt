    "linear ordering problem ( lop ) is an np - hard problem @xcite . in graph theory , lop is searching for an acyclic tournament having the maximum sum of arc weights in a complete weighted graph .",
    "in other words , lop is seeking a permutation of rows and columns in a given matrix of weights in order to maximize the sum of weights in the upper triangle @xcite .",
    "several methods were proposed to solve the linear ordering problem .",
    "exact methods @xcite and heuristic methods were proposed to address lop algorithms .",
    "heuristics are more efficiently in finding near - optimal solutions to lop : tabu search @xcite , scatter search @xcite , iterated local search @xcite , sorting through insertion pattern and permutation reversal @xcite and evolutionary algorithms @xcite .    some evolutionary approaches to lop presented and analyzed by snasel et al @xcite use two approaches : mutation only genetic algorithm and higher level chromosome genetic algorithm .",
    "these evolutionary methods obtain good results for problem instances from the library proposed by mitchell and borchers @xcite .",
    "two ant - based models are described for solving lop : a hybrid model based on the ant colony system ( acs ) @xcite , called ant colony system - insert move ( acs - im ) presented in @xcite and the second model is an extended version of the sensitive ant model ( sam ) @xcite which combines stigmergic communication with heterogeneous agent behavior .",
    "this technique , called step back sensitive ant model ( sb - sam ) @xcite extends sam method by defining new ( virtual state ) behavior for ants having a certain sensitivity level .",
    "lasius niger ants @xcite include u - turns in the process of selection which have a high impact on the quality of the detected paths .",
    "inspired by lasius niger ants behaviour , the virtual state transition rule avoids a selection of the next step from the available nodes making the agent to take a step back to the previous node and explore other regions of the search space .",
    "the sb - sam virtual state based decision making process generates a benefic exploratory behavior of the system which is balanced by the exploitation orientation of the highly sensitive agents in the system .",
    "the paper reports new results for the artificial lop large instances data generated by mitchell and bochers @xcite .",
    "both ant based techniques produce high - quality results for of lop competing with two genetic algorithms : mutation only genetic algorithm ( moga ) and higher level chromosome genetic algorithm ( hlcga ) @xcite .",
    "the results reported by sb - sam are better than those of acs - im and the already mentioned genetic algorithms .",
    "this is indicating the potential of inducing heterogeneity in ant - based models for better addressing difficult problems where complex behavior patterns are needed .",
    "numerical experiments on several lop instances available in the well - known real - world data library lolib @xcite are reported in @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : the linear ordering optimization problem is described ; ant colony models are described ; numerical experiments and comparisons are discussed and directions for future research are presented .",
    "one of the well - known np - hard problem is the linear ordering problem ( lop ) .",
    "lop is equivalent in economics with the triangulation problem for input - output tables in economics @xcite .",
    "single - server scheduling , ranking by aggregation of individual preferences in group decision making , archaeological seriation are other applications @xcite .",
    "+ in order to introduce lop , let @xmath0 be a matrix of weights .",
    "the value of @xmath1 refers to the cost of having object @xmath2 before object @xmath3 in the linear ordering .",
    "lop aims to find a permutation of the rows and columns @xmath4 such that the total weight ( sum of elements above the diagonal ) is maximized @xcite :    @xmath5    an acyclic tournament corresponds to a permutation of the graph vertices .",
    "let @xmath6 be a complete graph .",
    "v is the set of nodes and e contains the vertices of the graph and w refers to the weight ( or cost ) associated with an edge ( the weight from @xmath2 to @xmath3 can be different that the weight of @xmath3 to @xmath2 ) .",
    "the function to be maximized in lop is the following : @xmath7    where @xmath8 is a permutation of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is a total order relation on @xmath9 .",
    "the ant - based models involved in the present paper to solving linear ordering problem are described shortly in the following .    1 .",
    "_ ant colony systems _ + ant colony system ( acs ) metaheuristic is introduced in @xcite .",
    "the acs model replicates the behavior of social insects to the search space represented commonly by a graph .",
    "each edge has an associated weight as well as a pheromone value corresponding to a desirability measure .",
    "a problem solution is a complete tour generates a by an ant .",
    "the next node in the graph is choose probabilistically based on the weight and the amount of pheromone on the connecting edge @xcite .",
    "stronger pheromone trails are preferred by ants and the most promising tours build up higher amounts of pheromone in time . 2 .   _ ant colony system - insert move _",
    "+ the acs model for solving lop is called ant colony system - insert move ( acs - im ) @xcite .",
    "acs - im starts with a greedy search .",
    "acs - based rules are applied and a local search mechanism based on insert moves is engaged .",
    "the local search mechanism is based on the neighborhood search proposed for lop @xcite .",
    "insert moves ( i m ) are used to create a neighborhood of permutations for one solution .",
    "sensitive ant model _ + the sensitive ant model ( sam ) extends acs by inducing heterogeneity in the ant population @xcite .",
    "+ each ant is endowed with a pheromone sensitivity level ( psl - a real number in the unit interval ) .",
    "highly - sensitive ants are influenced by stigmergic information in the decision making process and thus likely to select strong pheromone trails .",
    "the ants with low sensitivity tend to ignore the amount of pheromone and bias the search towards unexplored regions .",
    "the new sam probability of selecting the next node is the same with the acs one when pheromone sensitivity level ( psl ) value is maximum being reduced proportionally with the sensitivity level in the rest of the cases .",
    "a virtual state is introduced in sam corresponding to the lost probability of ( 1  psl ) .",
    "the associated virtual state decision rule specifies the action to be taken when the virtual state is selected using the renormalized transition mechanism @xcite .",
    "step - back sensitive ant model _ + the step - back sensitive ant model ( sb - sam ) @xcite is based on the sensitive ant model ( sam ) @xcite .",
    "the aim of sb - sam is to better exploit the potential of the virtual state translating to a more reliable search space exploration .",
    "this is achieved by specifying a new action associated with the virtual decision rule inspired by the observed behavior of the ant lasius niger @xcite .",
    "biologists s study emphasize that some lasius niger suddenly move in the opposite direction making a u - turn and exploiting the geometry of the trail network bifurcation @xcite .",
    "these u - turns actually contribute more to the selection of a path compared to bi - directional trail laying .",
    "sam reinforce the inherent heterogeneity of the model facilitating a significant increase of diversity in the search .",
    "the virtual state transition rule specified by sb - sam makes the ant to take a step back by selecting the previous node @xcite .",
    "the pheromone trail is locally updated by decreasing the pheromone intensity on the edge connecting the current node with the previous one .",
    "the local virtual state update rule complements is given by the following equation : + @xmath12 + where @xmath13 represents the amount of pheromone on edge @xmath14 while @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the same parameters used in the acs local updating rule @xcite .",
    "the search continues from the new current node until a complete tour is built .",
    "the probability of an ant to take the virtual state decision is inverse proportionally with the ant s sensitivity level : lower psl means higher chance to take a step back whereas high psl values favor the application of the acs - inherited state transition rule .",
    "+ the step - back virtual decision rule generates completely new overall behavior for the system of interacting ants triggering search diversity . a good distribution of psl values in the population is important to create a balance in the search space between the exploitation and exploration @xcite .",
    "1 .   _ representation and initialization . _ + linear ordering : problem solution is a list of vertices , of a complete directed graph with n nodes .",
    "the list is constructed in a step by step manner by each ant based on the transition rules specified by the ant model .",
    "the algorithm is based on acs - im @xcite .",
    "it is initialized with a greedy solution obtained based on a 2-exchange neighborhood search , permuting two positions in the ordering @xcite .",
