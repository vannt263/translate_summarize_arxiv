    "since the discovery of the extrasolar giant planet ( egp ) , 51 pegasi b , in 1995 ( mayor & queloz 1995 ) , an explosion of similar discoveries has followed . to date , there are @xmath9 30 known planets orbiting nearby stars , which have collectively initiated the new field of extrasolar giant planet research .",
    "while to date most detections have been via doppler spectroscopy , other promising methods , both ground - based and space - based , are in development .",
    "these include ( but are not limited to ) astrometric techniques ( horner et al .",
    "1998 ) , nulling interferometry ( hinz et al . 1998 ) , coronographic imaging ( nakajima 1994 ) , and spectral deconvolution ( charbonneau et al . 1998 ) . furthermore , planned space instrumentation such as the ngst ( next generation space telescope ) and sim ( space interferometry mission ) may prove to be useful for the detection and characterization of egp systems .    with the current push for new instruments and techniques , we expect that some of these new egps will soon be directly detected .",
    "one group ( cameron et al . 1999 ) has claimed a detection in reflected light of the `` roaster , '' @xmath11 boo b , while another group ( charbonneau et al .",
    "1999 ) has not claimed a detection , but has quoted an upper limit to the albedo which is in conflict with cameron et al .",
    "our theoretical models of egp albedos are motivated by and can help guide attempts to directly detect egps in reflection by identifying their characteristic spectral features and by illuminating the systematics .",
    "the theoretical study of egp albedos and reflection spectra is still largely in its infancy .",
    "marley et al . ( 1999 ) have explored a range of stratosphere - free egp geometric and bond albedos using temperature - pressure profiles of egps in isolation ( i.e. no stellar insolation ) , while goukenleuque et al .",
    "( 1999 ) modeled 51 peg in radiative equilibrium , and seager & sasselov ( 1998 ) explored radiative - convective models of egps under strong stellar insolation . in the present study ,",
    "our purpose is to provide a broader set of models than previous work , and to establish a general understanding of the albedo and reflection spectra of egps over the full range of effective temperatures ( t@xmath8 ) . rather than attempting to model these spectra in a fully consistent way for the almost endless combinations of egp masses , ages , orbital distances , elemental abundances , and stellar spectral types , we concentrate on representative composition classes based loosely on t@xmath8 .",
    "the `` jovian '' class i objects ( t@xmath0 150 k ) are characterized by the presence of ammonia clouds .",
    "( note that the term , `` jovian '' , is used here for convenience , not to imply that this entire class of objects will be identical to jupiter . ) in somewhat warmer objects ( t@xmath12 250 k ) , ammonia is in its gaseous state , but the upper troposphere contains condensed h@xmath1o .",
    "these objects are designated class ii , or `` water cloud '' egps .",
    "class iii , or `` clear '' egps , are so named because they are too hot ( t@xmath4 350 k ) for significant h@xmath1o condensation and so are not expected to contain any principal condensates , though they are not necessarily completely cloud - free .",
    "the hotter egps ( 900 k @xmath3 t@xmath8 @xmath3 1500 k ; class iv ) include those objects with very small orbital distances ( `` roasters '' ) or those at large distances which are massive and young enough to have similar effective temperatures . in either case",
    ", the troposphere of such an egp is expected to contain significant abundances of neutral sodium and potassium gases , as well as a silicate cloud layer .",
    "the hottest ( t@xmath4 1500 ) and/or least massive ( g @xmath5 cm s@xmath6 ) have a silicate layer located so high in the atmosphere that much of the incoming radiation is shielded from alkali metal and molecular absorption .",
    "we use a planar asymmetric feautrier method in conjunction with temperature - pressure ( t - p ) profiles , equilibrium gas abundances ( assuming anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) elemental abundances ) , and simple cloud models to account for condensed species .",
    "the t - p profiles of isolated egps , as well as profiles which are nearly isothermal in the outer atmosphere , are utilized .",
    "this allows us to bracket the effects of various t - p profiles on the resulting egp albedo spectra . like marley et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , we generate model albedo and reflection spectra and bond albedos , assuming a variety of central star spectral types . similarly , rayleigh scattering , raman scattering , mie extinction due to condensates , and molecular absorption by a host of species are treated .",
    "in addition to our broader range of compositions and t@xmath8 than in marley et al . , we treat the important absorption effects of the alkali metals , include a larger number of relevant condensates ( including some non - equilibrium products typical of photolysis ) , and produce a synthetic albedo spectrum of jupiter which is in reasonable agreement with jupiter s actual albedo spectrum ( karkoschka 1994 ) from the soft uv to the near infrared .",
    "doppler spectroscopy favors the detection of massive companions at small orbital distances and indeed egps with very small orbital radii have been found .",

    "1999 ) all have orbital distances of less than 0.1 au and masses ( actually m@xmath14 ) ranging from @xmath90.4 to 3.4 jupiter masses . under stellar insolation ,",
    "the elevated temperatures of egps depend mostly on the level of stellar insolation , rather than on their masses and ages , which would largely determine their t@xmath8 in isolation .",
    "using simple radiative equilibrium arguments ( t@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the incident stellar flux ) , most of the egps within 0.1 au are likely to have very high t@xmath8 ( @xmath9 800 k to over 1600 k ) .",
    "t@xmath8 is only weakly dependent on the bond albedo for a large range of low - to - moderate albedos , varying only @xmath9 20% as the bond albedo varies from 0.01 to 0.6 .    at the other end of the scale , several objects with more traditional orbital distances of @xmath17",
    "1 au have been discovered .",
    "these egps include 16 cyg bb ( cochran et al .",
    "1997 ) , 47 uma b ( butler et al .",

    "1998 ) , hr 5568b , hr 810b , and hd 210277b ( marcy et al .",
    "1998 ) , and have m@xmath14 ranging from @xmath9 0.75 to 5 m@xmath18 . at these larger orbital distances , egps receive much less stellar radiation and , therefore , have a lower t@xmath8 ( @xmath3 300k ) .",
    "still , many other egps , such as 70 vir b ( butler & marcy 1996 ) , gl 86 ab ( queloz et al .",
    "1999 ) , and hd 114762b ( latham et al 1989 ) , have orbital distances between 0.1 and 1 au and m@xmath14 between 0.7 and 10 m@xmath18 .",
    "over the full set of currently known egps , spectral classes of the central stars range from f7v to m4v .",
    "the albedo of an object is simply the fraction of light that the object reflects .",
    "however , there are several different types of albedos .",
    "the _ geometric _ albedo refers to the reflectivity of the object at full phase ( @xmath19 , where @xmath20 represents the object s phase angle ) relative to that by a perfect lambert disk of the same radius under the same incident flux .",
    "since planets are essentially spheres , the factor projecting a unit surface onto a disk orthogonal to the line of sight is given by @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the object s longitude ( defined to be in the observer - planet - star plane ) and @xmath23 is its polar angle ( @xmath24 - latitude ) .",
    "the geometric albedo is given by integrating over the illuminated hemisphere : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the incident specific intensity , @xmath27 is the incident flux , and @xmath28 is the emergent intensity .",
    "more generally , @xmath29 , but at full phase all incident angles ( @xmath30 , @xmath31 ) are equal to the emergent ones .",
    "the geometric albedo is usually given as a function of wavelength , although it is sometimes averaged over a wavelength interval and stated as a single number .",
    "the _ spherical _ albedo , @xmath32 , refers to the fraction of incident light reflected by a sphere at all angles .",
    "usually stated as a function of wavelength , it is obtained by integrating the reflected flux over all phase angles .",
    "the flux ( @xmath33 ) as a function of phase angle ( @xmath20 ) is given by the more general form of eq .",
    "( [ geometric ] ) .",
    "assuming unit radius ( chamberlain & hunten 1987 ) , @xmath34    the spherical albedo is obtained by integrating @xmath33 over all solid angles : @xmath35    note that the spherical and geometric albedos are related by @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is known as the phase integral .",
    "the _ bond _ albedo , @xmath7 , is the ratio of the total reflected and total incident powers .",
    "it is obtained by weighting the spherical albedo by the spectrum of the illuminating source and integrating over all wavelengths : @xmath38 where the @xmath39 subscript signifies that the incident intensity varies with wavelength .",
    "spherical , geometric , and bond albedos of objects are strong functions of their compositions . within the solar system , they vary substantially with wavelength , and from object to object . at short wavelengths ,",
    "gaseous atmospheres can have high albedos due to rayleigh scattering , and low albedos at longer wavelengths due to molecular ro - vibrational absorption .",
    "icy condensates , whether they reside on a surface or are present in an upper atmosphere , are highly reflective and increase the albedo .",
    "other condensates , such as silicates or non - equilibrium products of photolysis , can lower the albedo substantially over a broad wavelength region",
    ".    some of the lowest albedos seen in the solar system are those of asteroids containing large amounts of carbonaceous material .",
    "many have bond albedos of less than 0.03 ( lebofsky et al 1989 ) .",
    "the bond albedo of the earth is 0.30 ( stephens et al . 1981 ) and that of the moon is 0.11 ( buratti 1996 ) .",
    "jupiter and saturn have somewhat higher bond albedos , both near 0.35 ( conrath et al . 1989 ) .    in  [",
    "modelsec ] , we describe our approach to modeling egps . section [ transfersec ] describes our radiative transfer method ,  [ moleculesec ] contains a discussion of molecular absorption and scattering , and ",
    "[ condensatesec ] describes the properties of and our treatment of the relevant condensates in egp atmospheres . in ",

    "[ parametersec ] describes the effects of varying key parameters of the models .",
    "we summarize our results in  [ conclusionsec ] .",
    "depending upon their proximity to their central stars as well as their masses and ages , egp effective temperatures likely span a large range , from below 100 k to well over 1600 k , with highly varying temperature - pressure - composition profiles . however , an egp s outer atmospheric composition , rather than its specific temperature - pressure profile , is of primary importance in modeling albedos and reflection spectra . with our composition classes ,",
    "we encompass the range of behaviors of egp albedos and reflection spectra .",
    "we do not model emission spectra , nor do our models account for object - specific details , such as elemental abundance differences or cloud patchiness .",
    "egps are surely at least as rich and varied as the planets of our solar system , but simple modeling reveals many interesting systematics .",
    "ideally , temperature ( t)-pressure ( p ) profiles are computed directly via radiative equilibrium models of egps under stellar insolation .",
    "a move toward such models for very strong stellar insolation has been made by seager & sasselov ( 1998 ) and goukenleuque et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , while for lower temperature objects , marley et al .",
    "( 1999 ) utilize t - p profiles of isolated egps .",
    "the main effect of stellar insolation on the t - p profile of an egp is to make the outer atmosphere more nearly isothermal .",
    "studies of strong stellar insolation conclude that a stratosphere does not exist in the high - temperature roasters ( seager & sasselov 1998 ; goukenleuque et al .",
    "1999 ) . however , it is not completely clear what might occur in the upper atmosphere if ultraviolet photochemical processes are fully modeled . under solar insolation ,",
    "jupiter and saturn do exhibit stratospheres , and we suspect that the class i egps are likely to have stratospheres as well . in an albedo spectrum ,",
    "the existence of a stratosphere is made manifest mainly by the scattering and absorption effects of non - equilibrium aerosols which reside there .",
    "additionally , photochemical processes in the stratosphere may be the origin of `` chromophores , '' non - equilibrium solids which settle near or in the upper cloud layers and are largely responsible for the coloration of jupiter .    to bracket the range of albedos under stellar insolation",
    ", we use two sets of pressure - temperature profiles .",
    "the first is a subset of profiles for theoretical isolated objects ( marley et al .",
    "1999 ; marley 1998 ; burrows et al . 1997 ) with t@xmath40 130 k ( representing an isolated class i egp ) , 250 k ( class ii ) , 600 k ( class iii ) , and 1200 k ( class iv ) .",
    "we estimate that these representative isolated t - p profiles are valid for surface gravities between @xmath41 to @xmath42 cm s@xmath6 .",
    "a set of modified profiles is obtained by altering these isolated profiles to simulate a stellar insolated t - p profile by using the model results of seager & sasselov ( 1998 ) as a guide . to approximate the t - p profiles of the very hottest close - in objects ( class v ) , we scale the 1200 k profile up to 1700 k. we stress that these modified profiles are very approximate , but along with the isolated t - p profiles , they bracket a broad range of possible egp t - p profiles .",
    "figure [ tpprofiles ] shows both the isolated and modified t - p profiles for classes i through iv , as well as our modified class v profile . also shown",
    "are condensation curves , which indicate the highest temperatures and pressures at which species can condense .",
    "cloud bases are located approximately where the profiles intersect the condensation curves ( dotted curves ) .",
    "class i ( `` jovian '' ) objects contain both ammonia and deeper water cloud layers , while water is likely the only principal condensate present in the tropospheres of class ii objects .",
    "( as shown in figure [ tpprofiles ] , a thin ammonia haze layer might appear very high in the atmosphere for an isolated class ii t - p profile . )",
    "the class iii t - p profile does nt cross any principal condensation curves in the upper atmosphere , regardless of the level of stellar insolation .",
    "finally , the class iv and v roasters contain a silicate cloud deck and a deeper iron cloud deck throughout the full range of possible t - p profiles , though their cloud depths differ considerably .      using the analytic formulae in burrows & sharp ( 1999 ) , we calculate gaseous mixing ratios of the main compounds of carbon , oxygen , and nitrogen ( ch@xmath2 , co , h@xmath1o",
    ", nh@xmath43 , n@xmath1 ) over the full range of temperatures and pressures in the model egp atmospheres . h@xmath1 and he mixing ratios are set according to anders & grevesse ( 1989 ) solar abundances , and the h@xmath1s mixing ratio is set in accordance with the anders & grevesse abundance of sulfur ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "the abundances of the alkali metals ( na , k , rb , cs ) , important in the class iii through class v egps , are calculated numerically using the formalism of burrows & sharp ( 1999 ) .",
    "overall , the effect of differences in the t - p profile on gaseous mixing ratios tends to be greatest for the class iv objects due to the temperature and pressure dependences of neutral alkali metal mixing ratios and the fact that the t - p profiles are in the vicinity of the ch@xmath2/co and nh@xmath43/n@xmath1 equilibrium curves . from the standpoint of gaseous abundances , the t - p profiles have little effect on the albedos of cooler egps .",
    "our treatment of clouds in our fiducial egp models assumes that the gaseous form of a condensable species is completely depleted above the cloud deck and that the species settles within the cloud layer in its condensed form .",
    "the base of the cloud resides where the t - p profile of the egp meets the condensation curve of the given species , and the cloud top is simply set at one pressure scale height above the base .",
    "not all of the given condensable within the cloud is in condensed form .",
    "rather , at the base of the cloud , the gaseous form is assumed to be at the saturation vapor pressure .",
    "for a given abundance of a condensable , if we assume that the portion of the condensable which exceeds the saturation vapor pressure is entirely in condensed form , we will refer to this as `` full condensation . ''",
    "however , as in jupiter s outer atmosphere ( see  [ jupitersec ] ) , it is possible that the condensation fraction will be smaller .",
    "hence , we retain the condensation fraction as a parameter . furthermore , the particle size distributions in egp atmospheres are impossible to ascertain at this point , so particle size remains a free parameter as well .",
    "the standard model for jupiter lends some support to our prescription for clouds .",
    "the base of jupiter s ammonia cloud deck resides approximately where its t - p profile meets the nh@xmath43 condensation curve ( @xmath9 0.7 bar ) and the cloud tops extend roughly one pressure scale height , to @xmath9 0.3 bar ( west et al .",
    "1986 ; griffith et al .",
    "although present , nh@xmath43 gas is largely depleted above the cloud layer .    in the case of silicate condensation , where the condensate and gas molecules are not identical ( unlike nh@xmath43 and h@xmath1o ) , the condensate abundance is estimated by the anders & grevesse abundance of the limiting species .",
    "we use enstatite ( mgsio@xmath43 ; though a number of other silicates with differing optical properties are certainly present ) , for which the limiting element is silicon . for the full condensation limit",
    ", it is assumed that the entire mass of silicon above the pressure of the cloud base settles into mgsio@xmath43 within the cloud .",
    "due to the forward scattering from condensates in egp atmospheres , an appropriate radiative transfer method must allow for a forward - backward asymmetric scattering phase function .",
    "although the conventional feautrier method ( e.g. mihalas 1978 ) does not allow for such an asymmetry , a straightforward extension of this technique can be derived by separating the source function into upward- and downward - propagating rays ( mihalas 1980 ; milkey et al .",
    "1975 ) .    at first thought",
    ", it may seem inappropriate to use a planar transfer code in the modeling of albedos and reflection spectra from spherical objects .",
    "however , it is fairly straightforward to derive the equivalence between uniform radiation from one direction onto a unit sphere and uniform radiation from 2@xmath45 steradians onto a plane with unit area .",
    "hence , provided that we set the incident intensity to be uniform in angle , the spherical albedo is the ratio of the outward and incident fluxes .",
    "the fundamental transfer equation is @xmath46 where the source function is given by @xmath47 and the thermal term is neglected in this albedo study .",
    "@xmath48 is the azimuth - independent angular redistribution function ( azimuthal symmetry is assumed ) and @xmath49 is the single - scattering albedo , @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the scattering cross section and @xmath52 is the extinction cross section .",

    "our atmosphere models utilize 100 optical depth zones with logarithmic sizing near the surface , where higher resolution is essential , and a continuous transition to linear zoning at depth .",

    "there are slightly larger variations when both @xmath102 and @xmath49 approach unity due to the finite number of angles and depth zones used in our numerical models , but in actual planetary or egp atmospheres , this corner of parameter space is rarely realized .",
    "real planetary atmospheres are usually highly stratified and the optical depth is a strong function of wavelength . given the atmospheric temperature - pressure - composition profile , an appropriate conversion to optical depth is required .",
    "assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and using an ideal gas equation of state , this conversion is @xmath103 where @xmath52 is the effective extinction cross section per particle at depth @xmath104 , @xmath63 is the mean molecular weight , and g is the surface gravity ( assumed constant because the depth of the effective atmosphere is a very small fraction of the planet s radius ) .",
    "the gases present in egp atmospheres are many ( burrows and sharp 1999 ) . however , only some of them have the requisite abundances and cross sections at the temperatures and pressures of upper egp atmospheres to have significant spectral effects in the visible and near - infrared .",

    "the dominant carbon - bearing molecule is a function of both temperature and pressure .",
    "chemical equilibrium modeling ( burrows and sharp 1999 ; fegley & lodders 1996 ) shows that , at solar metallicity , ch@xmath2 will dominate over co in most egp atmospheres . at high temperatures",
    ", the co abundance overtakes that of ch@xmath2 ( @xmath9 1100 k at 1 bar ; @xmath9 1400 k at 10 bars ) .",
    "there is a similar transition for the nitrogen - bearing molecules : nh@xmath43 dominates at low temperatures , but it is overtaken by n@xmath1 at higher temperatures ( @xmath9 700 k at 1 bar ; @xmath9 900 k at 10 bars ) .",
    "some species condense into solids at low temperatures , thereby depleting the gaseous phase .",
    "in particular , nh@xmath43 condenses below 150200 k ( depending upon pressure ) , as does h@xmath1o below 250300 k.    at visible and near - infrared wavelengths , molecular absorption is due to ro - vibrational transitions , so molecular opacity is a very strong function of wavelength .",
    "even when no permanent dipole moment exists , such as with the h@xmath1 molecule , the high gas pressures in egp atmospheres can induce temporary dipole moments via collisions .",
    "this collision induced absorption ( cia ) is responsible for broad h@xmath1-h@xmath1 ( and h@xmath1-he ) absorption bands in jupiter and saturn ( zheng & borysow 1995 ; trafton 1967 ) .",
    "the temperature- and pressure - dependent gaseous opacities are obtained from a variety of sources  a combination of theoretical and experimental data as referenced in burrows et al .",

    "the presence of alkali metals in the troposphere has a substantial lowering effect on the albedo . as per figure [ spherical2]a , sodium and potassium absorption lowers the albedo at short wavelengths , resulting in a spherical albedo below @xmath9 0.6 throughout most of the uv / blue spectral region . into the red region ,",
    "lower rayleigh scattering cross sections and strong alkali metal absorption result in spherical albedos which drop below 0.1 .",

    "furthermore , the silicate cloud deck is expected to be somewhat higher in the atmosphere ( figure [ tpprofiles ] ) and to have a non - negligible effect on the albedo in both the visible and near - infrared regions ( figure [ spherical2]b ) .    due to the low ionization potentials of sodium ( 5.139 ev ) and potassium ( 4.341 ev ) ,",

    "( 1997 ) .",
    "given the list of over two dozen known egps , it is possible that none is cold enough to be a class i ( `` jovian '' ) object ( hr 5568b is an ambiguous case ) .",

    "in egp atmospheres , variations in condensation fractions and particle size distributions , as well as the possible presence of stratospheric and tropospheric non - equilibrium species , can have large effects on the spherical and bond albedos .",
    "first , we consider the effects of lowering the condensation fraction to 10% and 1% . figures [ condfrac]a and [ condfrac]b show the substantial changes in class i ( `` jovian '' ) and class ii ( `` water cloud '' ) egps .",
    "the class ii case best illustrates the systematic effects , since only an h@xmath1o cloud deck exists .",
    "( recall that the class i model contains an ammonia cloud deck above a water cloud deck . )",
    "the condensation fraction has a substantial effect on the spherical and geometric albedos .",
    "less condensation clearly results in lower albedos , especially in the red / near - infrared , where gaseous opacities are strong ( marley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "note that the effects of the alkali metals , deep in the atmosphere , are apparent in the uv / blue albedo of the class ii , 1% condensation model . as shown in tables [ bondtaba ] and [ bondtabb ] , the bond albedos of these 1% condensation models are significantly lower than those of their `` full condensation '' counterparts , particularly for the class ii egps .",
    "cloud particle size distributions in egps are not known . as alluded to in  [ condensatesec ] , for a given condensate abundance ,",
    "the net extinction by condensates ( almost pure scattering for h@xmath1o ice ) is smaller when particle sizes are larger .",
    "this is shown explicitly in figure [ paramfig]a , comparing spherical albedos for deirmendjian h@xmath1o ice `` cloud '' distributions with size peaks of 0.5 @xmath63 m , 5 @xmath63 m ( fiducial ) , and 50 @xmath63 m .",
    "the qualitative effect of increasing the peak size is similar to the effect of reducing the condensation fraction .",
    "widening the distribution has similar consequences because the largest particles squander the condensate , reducing the number density of smaller scattering particles .",
    "non - equilibrium species in the upper atmospheres of egps may be produced by uv - induced processes . while both gaseous and condensed species are likely to be produced , the condensates will generally have greater effects on the albedos and reflection spectra . as in the atmosphere of jupiter , stratospheric hazes and tropospheric chromophores , or impurities within or above the principal cloud layers ,",
    "can lower the albedo spectra in the uv / blue range and can also modify their character at other wavelengths .",
    "in addition to their compositions , the size distributions of these non - equilibrium species play a role .",
    "figure [ paramfig]b shows the effect of including a representative upper tropospheric `` haze '' of tholin ( with mixing ratio of 10@xmath158 ) on the spherical albedo of a class i egp . in analogy with our jupiter model , the size distribution is peaked at 0.05 @xmath63 m .",
    "although the abundances and size distributions of such particles in egps are unknown , we present this model as an indication of the qualitative effect that this type of haze would have on the albedo .",
    "the associated class i bond albedo , assuming a g2v central star , decreases from 0.57 to 0.48 .",
    "we represent the optically dominant aerosol within stratospheric hazes by polyacetylene , although other possibilities certainly exist .",
    "our models show that the effect of polyacetylene on the albedo is minor , lowering the uv / blue albedo no more than a few percent , assuming a mixing ratio as large as @xmath140 .",
    "we stress that the actual compositions , abundances , and the size distributions of non - equilibrium species in egps are unknown , and that the quantitative effects on egp albedos may or may not be significant .",
    "the classification of egps into five composition classes , related to t@xmath8 , is instructive , since the albedos of objects within each of these classes exhibit similar features and values .",
    "the principal condensate in class i `` jovian '' egps ( t@xmath0 150 k ) is nh@xmath43 , while in class ii `` water cloud '' egps it is h@xmath1o ice .",
    "gaseous molecular absorption features , especially those of methane , are exhibited throughout class i and ii albedo spectra . assuming adequate levels of condensation , class ii egps are the most highly reflective of any class . for lower condensation fractions ,",
    "the albedos of both classes fall off more quickly with increasing wavelength relative to `` full condensation '' models  especially the class ii objects .",
    "even a small mixing ratio of a non - equilibrium tropospheric condensate within or above a cloud deck can depress the uv / blue albedo and reflection spectrum significantly .    in class iii `` clear '' egps ( t@xmath4 350 k ) , little condensation is likely , and so albedos are determined almost entirely by atomic and molecular absorption and rayleigh scattering .",
    "radiation generally penetrates more deeply into these atmospheres , to pressures and temperatures where sodium and potassium absorption and h@xmath1-h@xmath1 collision - induced absorption ( cia ) become substantial . throughout most of the visible spectral region ,",
    "the albedo decreases with increasing wavelength . in the near - infrared",
    ", cia , h@xmath1o , and ch@xmath2 conspire to keep the albedo very low .    in the upper atmospheres of the high - temperature ( 900 k @xmath3 t@xmath0 1500 k ) class iv roasters , the equilibrium abundances of the alkali metals are higher than in the class iii egps ,",
    "so the absorption lines of sodium and potassium are expected to lower the albedo more dramatically . a silicate cloud exists at moderate depths ( @xmath9 510 bars ) , but the large absorption cross sections of the sodium and potassium gases above it preclude the cloud from having a significant effect on the albedo . like class",
    "iii egps , the near - infrared albedo is expected to remain close to zero in the absence of non - equilibrium condensates .",
    "the hottest ( t@xmath4 1500 k ) and/or lowest gravity ( g @xmath5 cm s@xmath6 ) roasters ( class v ) have a silicate layer located much higher in the atmosphere relative to the class iv roasters . this layer is expected to reflect much of the incident radiation before it is absorbed by neutral sodium and potassium and molecular species .",
    "hence , class v egps have much higher albedos than those of class iv .    while stratospheres generally are not anticipated in high temperature egps ( seager & sasselov 1998 ; goukenleuque et al .",
    "1999 ) , it is possible that more detailed modeling will show that they do exist .",
    "the presence of a stratosphere would give rise to visible and infrared emission features not otherwise seen .",
    "furthermore , the presence of non - equilibrium solids due to photochemistry may decrease the albedo in the uv / blue , but increase it somewhat in the red / near - infrared because even largely absorbing condensates are more reflective than gaseous molecular species in this spectral region .",
    "differences in particle size distributions of the principal condensates can have large quantitative , or even qualitative effects on the resulting albedo spectra .",
    "in general , less condensation , larger particle sizes , and wider size distributions result in lower albedos .    despite many uncertainties in the atmospheric details of egps",
    ", our set of model albedo spectra serves as a useful guide to the prominent features and systematics over a full range of egp effective temperatures , from @xmath9 100 k to 1700 k. full radiative equilibrium modeling of a given egp at a specific orbital distance from its central star ( of given spectral type ) , and of specific mass , age , and composition is necessary for a detailed understanding of an object .",
    "however , as observational egp spectra become available , our set of model albedo spectra offers a means by which a quick understanding of their general character is possible , and by which some major atmospheric constituents , both gaseous and condensed , may be inferred .",
