    "the most recent cosmological observations indicate that the present universe is flat and vacuum dominated  @xcite .",
    "in such a vacuum dominated space - time , the distance analysis requires computer intensive numerical calculations .",
    "even though , computers today are very fast , efficient analytical calculation of distance scales would be very useful for various types of monte carlo simulations .",
    "the most fundamental distance scale in the universe is the luminosity distance , defined by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the observed flux of an astronomical object and @xmath3 is its luminosity .",
    "current astronomical observations indicate that the present density parameter of the universe satisfy @xmath4 with @xmath5 . here",
    "@xmath6 is the contribution from the vacuum and @xmath7 is the contribution from all other fields .",
    "the distance calculations in such a vacuum dominated universe involve repeated numerical calculations and elliptic functions  @xcite .    in order to simplify the numerical calculations , @xcite ( hereafter pen99 )",
    "has developed quite an efficient analytical recipe . in this paper , we show another analytical method , similar in many respect to that of pen99 , that can be used to calculate the distances in a vacuum dominated flat universe .    our analytical calculation is shown to run faster than that of pen99 and has smaller error variations with respect to redshift ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath6 .",
    "our recipe for calculating the luminosity distance is the following ( @xmath9 is the present hubble constant and @xmath10 is the speed of light ) :    @xmath11,\\ ] ]    @xmath12,\\ ] ]    @xmath13    @xmath14",
    "we first begin by analyzing how the scale factor , @xmath15 varies as a function of time @xmath16 in a flat universe in which @xmath17 . in this case , @xmath15 is given by  @xcite @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the present value of the scale factor .",
    "the above equation is then immediately integrated into @xmath20.\\ ] ] the scale factor is directly related to the @xmath8 as , @xmath21 let us define @xmath22 and indicate its present value by @xmath23 .",
    "then , equations [ eq : no4 ] and [ eq : no4b ] give @xmath24\\ ] ] if we define @xmath25 as follows @xmath26 and since @xmath27 we can write @xmath28 as @xmath29 we note that @xmath28 is a monotonically decreasing function beyond @xmath30 .",
    "we choose the standard robertson - walker metric  @xcite as the metric of the background space - time . with usual notation ,",

    "this integral can be evaluated in terms of hypergeometric functions and related elliptic integrals .",
    "but here we take an alternate , simple approach by defining a new function ,    @xmath35^{2/3}}.\\ ] ]    in the standard model the luminosity distance is defined as @xmath36 .",

    "in order to compare the method of pen99 to ours , lets define the absolute relative percentage error as follows .",
    "@xmath43 here @xmath44 and @xmath45 are luminosity distance values calculated from approximate analytical methods and numerical method respectively .",
    "a comparison of @xmath46 for both analytical methods for @xmath47 is shown in figure  [ wickpencompare ] .",
    "our method has a better absolute relative percentage error value for @xmath48 , @xmath49 and @xmath50 compared to that of pen99 .",
    "we note that the error in our method decreases steadily with redshift approaching @xmath51 % at @xmath52 . in comparison , for high redshifts",
    ", pen99 error always stays @xmath53 0.09% and does not decrease appreciably .",
    "a contour plot of @xmath46 based on the method of pen99 with various @xmath8 and @xmath6 is shown in figure  [ contourpen ] .",
    "relatively complicated distribution of variations in the @xmath46 can be seen for the parameter space characterized by @xmath8 and @xmath6 .",
    "however , a contour plot of @xmath46 for our method , which is shown in figure  [ contourwick ] , shows a smooth behavior over the same parameter space .        in order to investigate the running time of the two analytical methods we performed the following test . with @xmath54 and @xmath47 , we calculated the running time for 1 million calculations on a typical personal computer ( intel core 2 processor , 2127 mhz , 1 gb ram , idl version 6.2 running on windows xp service pack 3 ) .",
    "then we repeated the above process 100 times for the both methods .",
    "histogram of both running time results are shown in figure  [ histopenwick ] .",
    "our method is significantly faster than the method of pen99 .",
    "in addition , we performed the same test on the numerical method and found that our method is more than an order of magnitude faster .",
    "however , we note that the above test is hardware and compiler dependent and results may vary depending on the hardware and the compiler used .    with less than 0.1% error",
    ", our analytical method becomes quite desirable as the most interesting astronomical phenomena happen at @xmath55 ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "furthermore , the analytical computation is more elegant and faster compared to traditional numerical computations invoked in connection with calculations of distances in a vacuum dominated flat universe ."
