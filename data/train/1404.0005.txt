    "a number of available models for brown dwarfs include models cold enough to represent y dwarfs allard12 , saumon12 , morley12 , but do not yet treat the effects of water clouds .",
    "the first models to incorporate the effects of water clouds into a brown dwarf atmosphere are those of burrows03b .",
    "these models generally find that water clouds do not strongly affect the spectrum of y dwarfs , but there have been few followup studies .",
    "hubeny07 also includes simple water clouds with a fixed mode particle size of 100 . in section [ burrows ]",
    "we will discuss how our results compare to these early models .",
    "a number of studies have included water clouds in exoplanetary atmospheres ; marley99 and sudarsky00 both modeled the effect of water clouds on the albedos of giant exoplanets ; they find the formation of water clouds significantly increases the planetary albedos .",
    "burrows04 also consider water clouds in exoplanets , using a similar approach as burrows03b but for irradiated planets ; sudarsky03 and sudarsky05 calculate the thermal emission of exoplanets that include water clouds and find that they have a strong effect on the emergent spectrum .",
    "clouds have posed the greatest challenge for brown dwarf modeling since the first l dwarfs were discovered . as brown dwarfs cool along the l sequence from 2500 k to 1300 k , refractory materials like corundum , iron , and silicates condense to form thick dust layers lunine86 , fegley96 , burrows99 , lodders02 , lodders03 , lodders06 , helling06 , visscher10 which thicken as the brown dwarf cools .",
    "these dust clouds shape the emergent spectra of l dwarfs [ see , e.g.][]tsuji96 , allard01,marley02,burrows06,helling08,cushing08,witte11 .    for field",
    "brown dwarfs these clouds clear over a very small range of effective temperature around 12001300 k and around the same temperature , methane features begin to appear in the near - infrared .",
    "the brown dwarf is then classified as a t dwarf and , for many years , mid to late t dwarfs were considered to be cloud - free .",
    "however , it has long been recognized that other somewhat less refractory materials such as sulfides and salts should condense in cooler t dwarfs lodders99 . as",
    "late t dwarfs ( 500900 k ) were discovered and characterized , a population of objects redder in the near - infrared ( e.g. @xmath5 , @xmath6 colors ) than the predictions of cloud - free models emerged .",
    "morley12 included the clouds predicted to form by condensation of the sulfides and alkali salts and showed that by including thin layers of these clouds , the colors and spectra of these redder observed t dwarfs can be matched .",
    "as these t dwarfs are further characterized , variability has been observed in mid - late t dwarfs buenzli12 ; the sulfide clouds may play a role in this variability .",
    "spectra of directly - imaged planets are also strongly influenced by the opacity of clouds .",
    "the first multi - planet directly - imaged system , hr 8799 , has four planets , all of which have infrared colors that indicate cloudy atmospheres , much like l dwarfs marois08 . other planetary - mass objects also appear to have spectral properties similar to l dwarfs including @xmath7 pictoris b bonnefoy13 and 2m1207b barman11b .",
    "in fact , at similar effective temperatures planetary - mass objects appear to be even more cloudy than their brown dwarf counterparts madhu11c , barman11 , which has been used to suggest that the breakup of the iron and silicate clouds at the l / t transition may be gravity dependent metchev06 , marley12 .",
    "nonetheless the transition to a methane - dominated atmosphere and cloud - depleted near - infrared spectrum must happen at some effective temperature , with the resulting objects appearing as low - gravity ` t ' and ` y ' dwarfs .",
    "the first such object discovered is gj 504b kuzuhara13 which is currently the coldest directly - imaged planet ( @xmath0@xmath1500 k ) and has colors very similar to t dwarfs ; followup observations probing the methane feature at 1.6  suggest that , as expected from thermochemical equilibrium calculations , methane is present in the atmosphere janson13 .      in a cold solar composition atmosphere , water clouds will be a massive cloud and an important opacity source . unlike the refractory clouds which have been extensively studied by a number of groups am01 , helling06 , allard01 , tsuji96 , burrows06 , helling08",

    "we study the signatures of the water clouds and their optical properties , estimate their likely particle sizes , and determine at which effective temperatures the cloud will become optically thick in the photosphere .",
    "we end by considering the observability of y dwarfs with the four major instruments being built for the _ james webb space telescope ( jwst ) _ and the detectability of cool giant planets with new and upcoming ground - based instruments .",
    "we calculate 1d pressure  temperature profiles , which are self - consistent with both the chemistry and clouds , of atmospheres in radiative  convective equilibrium .",
    "the thermal radiative transfer is determined using the `` source function technique '' presented in toon89 .",
    "the gas opacity is calculated using correlated - k coefficients to increase calculation speed ; our opacity database incorporates published data from both laboratory experiments and first - principles quantum mechanics calculations and is described extensively in freedman08 .",
    "the opacity database includes two significant updates since freedman08 , which are described in saumon12 : a new molecular line list for ammonia yurchenko11 and an improved treatment of the pressure - induced opacity of h@xmath2 collisions richard12 .",
    "the cloud opacity is included as mie scattering of spherical cloud particles in each atmospheric layer .",
    "the atmosphere models are more extensively described in mckay89 , marley96 , burrows97 , mm99 , marley02 , saumon08 , fortney08b .",
    "the cloud model calculates the vertical locations , heights , and mode particle sizes of clouds as they condense in the atmosphere .",
    "the calculation is coupled with the radiative transfer calculations , so a converged model will have a temperature structure that is self - consistent with the clouds .    the cloud code is a modification of the am01 cloud model .",
    "this model has successfully been used to model the effects of the iron , silicate , and corundum clouds on the spectra of l dwarfs saumon08,stephens09 as well as the sulfide and chloride clouds that likely form in the atmospheres of t dwarfs morley12 . here , we modify it to include the effects of water clouds .",
    "the am01 approach avoids treating the highly uncertain microphysical processes that create clouds in brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres .",
    "instead , it aims to balance the advection and diffusion of each species vapor and condensate at each layer of the atmosphere .",
    "it balances the upward transport of vapor and condensate by turbulent mixing in the atmosphere with the downward transport of condensate by sedimentation .",
    "this balance is achieved using the equation    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the vertical eddy diffusion coefficient , @xmath10 is the mixing ratio of condensate and vapor , @xmath11 is the mixing ratio of condensate , @xmath12 is the convective velocity scale , and @xmath13  is a parameter that describes the efficiency of sedimentation in the atmosphere .    solving this equation allows us to calculate the total amount of condensate in each layer of the atmosphere .",
    "we calculate the modal particle size using the sedimentation flux and by prescribing a lognormal size distribution of particles , given by @xmath14}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the total number concentration of particles , @xmath16 is the geometric mean radius , and @xmath17 is the geometric standard deviation .",
    "we fix @xmath17 at 2.0 for this study ( see discussion in am01 ) .",
    "we calculate the falling speeds of particles within this distribution assuming viscous flow around spheres ( and using the cunningham slip factor to account for gas kinetic effects ) .",
    "we calculate the other parameters in equation [ advdiff ] ( @xmath9 and @xmath12 ) using mixing length theory and by prescribing a lower bound for @xmath9 of 10@xmath18 @xmath19/s , which represents the residual turbulence due to processes such as breaking gravity waves in the radiative regions of the atmosphere .",
    "this process allows us to calculate the mode particle size in each layer of the atmosphere using calculated or physically motivated values for all parameters except for the free parameter @xmath13 . in general",
    ", we find larger particles ( which have higher terminal velocities ) in the bottom layers of a cloud and smaller particles ( which have lower terminal velocities ) in the upper layers .",
    "a high sedimentation efficiency parameter @xmath13  results in vertically thinner clouds with larger particle sizes , whereas a lower @xmath13  results in more vertically extended clouds with smaller particles sizes . as a result",
    ", a higher @xmath13  corresponds to optically thinner clouds and a lower @xmath13  corresponds to optically thicker clouds .",
    "the am01 cloud model code computes the available quantity of condensible gas above the cloud base by comparing the local gas abundance ( accounting for upwards transport by mixing via @xmath20 ) to the local condensate vapor pressure @xmath21 . in cases where the formation of condensates does not proceed by homogeneous condensation",
    "we nevertheless compute an equivalent vapor pressure curve .",
    "the condensation of water vapor into water ice clouds poses some unique problems for our self - consistent equilibrium approach .",
    "water vapor is the most dominant source of opacity in a y dwarf atmosphere .",
    "after it condenses , if the cloud opacity is somehow removed , there is very little gas opacity left in the atmosphere and the layers beneath can radiate efficiently .",
    "however , the cloud opacity can not just be removed from the atmosphere ; it must condense into a cloud , and because oxygen is one of the most abundant elements , the water cloud that forms is quite massive and optically thick .",
    "this means that the dominant vapor opacity source condenses into a dominant solid opacity source .    in practice ,",
    "when aiming to calculate a solution in radiative  convective and chemical equilibrium that is self - consistent with the water cloud , we find that we are not able to find a self - consistent solution for a range of model effective temperatures from @xmath1225450 k. as the water cloud forms in the model , it significantly warms the atmosphere below it because it prevents flux from escaping .",
    "this warming causes the cloud to evaporate , removing the opacity source , and allowing flux to escape and cool the atmosphere again ; a cloud forms again . an equilibrium solution is not found .",
    "to solve this problem , we borrow phenomenological ideas from our own solar system . when water clouds are observed in the solar system on earth , jupiter , and saturn , they never form in a globally homogeneous layer .",
    "instead , they form into patchy clouds .",
    "for example , on jupiter , there are 5  hot spots though which flux emerges from deep within the atmosphere ; these are believed to be `` holes '' or thin areas of the deep jovian water cloud westphal69 , westphal74 , orton96 , carlson94 .",
    "saturn has similar mid - infrared heterogeneity baines05 .    because water clouds _ never _ appear to form globally homogeneous , uniform clouds in the solar system planets , models that include clouds for these planets do not attempt to find a 1d steady - state equilibrium solution in a self - consistent way",
    "instead , for clouds in earth s atmosphere , the evolution of clouds is either modeled over time using a time - stepping model or the clouds are modeled in 2d or 3d .",
    "in fact a method sometimes used in 3d circulation models on earth inspires our approach , described below . in these circulation models ,",
    "clouds form on scales smaller than the grid scale ; cloud opacity is implemented using a two - column sub - grid approach .",
    "other previous efforts for exoplanets and brown dwarfs either did not iterate or used a highly specified cloud parametrization for particle size and cloud height [ e.g][]marley99 , sudarsky00 , hubeny07 .",
    "our approach here is not to include a specified cloud , but instead to iteratively solve for a cloud profile that is self - consistent with the atmosphere structure .",
    "we rely on a model which successfully reproduces cloud particle sizes and distributions on jupiter and earth am01 .",
    "perhaps fortuitously , the particular cloud model employed by burrows03b , who also solve the problem self - consistently , produced somewhat large particles with small infrared optical depth .",
    "more general cases in which some clouds have smaller particle sizes have a far greater optical depth and are more challenging to converge .    in this work",
    ", we make the assumption that patchy water clouds also form in brown dwarfs . theoretical motivation for this patchiness has not yet been well - developed , but recent highly idealized models suggest that the rotation and internal heating of brown dwarfs could drive jet - like or vortex - like circulation zhang14 .",
    "such weather patterns in the atmosphere may create rising and sinking parcels of air and maintain inhomogeneous clouds .",
    "other evidence for cloud patchiness in the silicate cloud decks of warmer brown dwarfs has been seen in the variability observations by , e.g. , radigan12 and the spatial mapping of the l / t transition brown dwarf luhman 16b crossfield14 .    in this model , even though the water cloud layer forms a thick opacity source , the flux can emerge from holes in the cloud deck .",
    "this assumption allows us to calculate a temperature structure in radiative  convective equilibrium that is self - consistent with the clouds because flux is able to emerge through the holes even when the clouds become optically thick .",
    "this means that the temperature structure can remain cool enough to have a condensed water cloud layer .      .",
    "@xmath22 represents a fully clear atmosphere ; @xmath23 represents a fully cloudy atmosphere . for the models in the grid presented here , @xmath24 .",
    ", width=360 ]    we calculate patchy clouds following the approach of marley10 , who implemented patchy clouds in an attempt to understand a mechanism that could reproduce the l / t transition , in which clouds break up progressively and more flux emerges from holes in the clouds . following this prescription ,",
    "we calculate flux separately through both a cloudy column ( with the cloud opacity included ) and a clear column ( with the cloud opacity not included ) with the same pressure  temperature profile .",
    "this calculation is shown schematically in figure [ cartoon ] .",
    "we can change the cloud - covering fraction by varying @xmath25 , the fractional area of the atmosphere assumed to be covered in holes :    @xmath26    using this summed flux @xmath27 through each atmospheric layer , we iterate as usual until we find a solution in radiative  convective equilibrium .",
    "using @xmath280.40.5 greatly improves convergence . with a hole fraction of at least 4050% , flux escapes from warm , deep layers through the cloud - free column and a consistent @xmath29 profile with water clouds can be calculated .      to model clouds and their radiative effect in the atmosphere , we need three pieces of information about the material .",
    "the first is the optical properties  the real and imaginary parts of the refractive index  of the condensed solid or liquid . in y dwarfs",
    ", water always condenses in the solid phase burrows03b , so we use the optical properties of water ice warren84 .",
    "the second property is the material s density ; we use 0.93 g/@xmath30 for water ice .",
    "lastly , we need the saturation vapor pressure of water ice , which tells us where the cloud will form and how much material is available to form it .",
    "we assume that all material in excess of the saturation vapor pressure condenses to form a cloud .",
    "we use the equation from buck81 to describe the saturation vapor pressure of water ice :    @xmath31\\ ] ]    where @xmath32 is the temperature in degrees celsius and @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and @xmath36 are constants ( 6.1115@xmath37 , 23.036 , 279.82 , and 333.7 , respectively ) .",
    "the other clouds included in these models are cr , mns , na@xmath2s , kcl , and zns .",
    "the thermochemical models that describe the formation of these clouds are described in visscher06 .",
    "using these models , fits to the saturation vapor pressure as a function of pressure , temperature , and metallicity were presented in morley12 , section 2.4 .",
    "sources of the optical properties used in the mie scattering calculations are also presented in table 1 of morley12 .",
    "our grid of models encompasses the full range of y dwarfs and extends the grid from morley12 to lower temperatures .",
    "this grid includes models from 200450 k in increments of 2550 k. we include surface gravities that range from giant planets to brown dwarfs , from log @xmath38 of 3.0 to 5.0 in increments of 0.5 .",
    "we run all models on this main grid with @xmath13=5 and @xmath25=0.5 .    of course",
    ", it is likely that @xmath25 and @xmath13  vary , and could in fact be different for the underlying sulfide / salt clouds and the higher altitude water clouds .",
    "in fact , models at the l / t transition generally need to include non - uniformity in cloud properties across the transition to match its shape marley10 .",
    "we do not aim to fully model all parts of this parameter space here .",
    "however , we do explore some parts of this space ; we run additional models in which we vary @xmath13  from 37 at a single surface gravity ( log @xmath38=4.0 ) and in which we vary @xmath25 from 0.2 to 1.0 ( see figure [ diffcloudcover ] ) . we assume solar metallicity composition for all models , using elemental abundances from lodders03 .",
    "the grid was deliberately chosen to be square , but includes some unphysical combinations of temperature and surface gravity , because higher mass brown dwarfs can not have cooled enough during the age of the universe to reach very low temperatures .",
    "for the coolest models in our grid , @xmath0=200 k , the maximum expected log @xmath38 ( that of a 10 gyr brown dwarf ) is @xmath39 . for 300 k",
    ", maximum log @xmath38 is @xmath404.6 ; for 450 k , @xmath14.75.0 saumon08 .",
    "the ranges come from using a cloudy or cloud - free atmospheric boundary condition for the evolution models , see figures 4 and 5 from saumon08 .",
    "absolute fluxes and magnitudes are calculated from our model spectra by applying the evolutionary radii of saumon08 . those cooling sequences provide the radius of the brown dwarf as a function of @xmath0 and @xmath41 . here we have used the radii from the evolution sequences computed with cloudless atmospheres as the surface boundary condition . a fully self - consistent calculation of the evolution would use a surface boundary condition defined by the corresponding model atmospheres .",
    "this is becoming increasingly difficult for brown dwarfs as the evolution of clouds during the long cooling time of the very cool objects considered here is rather complex .",
    "the sequence of transitions from cloudy l dwarfs to mainly clear mid - t dwarfs , to late - t dwarfs veiled with sulfide clouds ( mns , na@xmath2s , zns , cr , kcl ) , which may also clear out in early y dwarfs before water clouds appear , has yet to be understood properly , both empirically and theoretically .",
    "the use of a uniform , cloudless surface boundary condition has the virtue of simplicity .",
    "we can estimate the uncertainty in the radius thus obtained by comparing the surface boundary condition extracted from the present atmosphere models to those used by saumon08 .",
    "we find that for our nominal @xmath42 , @xmath24 partly cloudy sequence , the entropy at the bottom of the atmosphere ( which gives the entropy of the matching interior model ) is quite close to the cloudless case at @xmath43k .",
    "as the object cools the entropy decreases , and for @xmath44k the entropy is close to the entropy of cloudy atmospheres used in saumon08 .",
    "this nicely corresponds to the transition of the partly cloudy models from optically thin to optically thick water clouds .",
    "figures 4 and 5 of saumon08 show that for given @xmath0 and @xmath41 , the radii between the cloudless and cloudy evolution sequences vary by at most 12% below 500@xmath45k .",
    "thus , the inconsistency between the surface boundary condition used in the evolution sequences and the model atmospheres presented here causes at most a 4% error in the absolute fluxes .",

    "if the absorption efficiency is very low at a given wavelength , photons from layers below the cloud will have a very low probability of being absorbed by the cloud ; thus the spectrum will appear essentially as it would in a cloud - free atmosphere at that wavelength .    the single scattering albedo quantifies the importance of scattering and absorption by cloud particles .",
    "it is the ratio of the scattering coefficient to extinction coefficient ( including both scattering and absorption ) at a given wavelength .",
    "a single scattering albedo of 1.0 indicates that the cloud particles are entirely scatterers ; a single scattering albedo of 0.0 indicates that the cloud particles are entirely absorptive .",
    "figure [ ssa ] shows the single scattering albedo for the clouds in the @xmath0=200 and 275 k models also shown in figure [ cloudcolopdreff ] .",
    "we show both the single scattering albedo for the sodium sulfide cloud , which is deep within the atmosphere at @xmath1 100 bar , and the water ice cloud , which is in the photosphere around 0.11.0 bar .",
    "the single scattering albedo of the sulfide cloud is almost identical for each of these two model atmospheres ; it rises from 0.6 in the optical to 0.95 at 12 , indicating that the cloud becomes less efficient at absorbing as the wavelength increases .",
    "in contrast , the single scattering albedo of the water ice cloud has strong absorption features throughout the near and mid - infrared .",
    "the two models have slightly different features because the particle sizes are different , and the scattering and absorption properties depend fairly strongly on particle size ( see figure [ miescattering ] ) . for the 200 k object ,",
    "the water ice mode particle size at 2 bar is about 20 . for the warmer 275 k model , the mode particle size at 0.03",
    "bar is about a factor of four smaller , @xmath15 .",
    "however , the strongest features are evident for both models .",
    "the most obvious is the sharp decrease in single scattering albedo at 2.8 , indicating that the cloud becomes more strongly absorbing at that wavelength .",
    "the feature at 10  is very evident for the warmer model , and much more muted in the cooler model .",
    "the presence of features indicates that water ice is not a mostly gray absorber ( like many of the more refractory clouds are ) and , when present and optically thick , may cause spectral features , including ones that depend on particle size .",
    "examples of model pressure  temperature profiles for the model grid are shown in figure [ pt - profile ] .",
    "in general , cloud opacity in a brown dwarf increases the temperature of the atmosphere at all points in the atmosphere .",
    "this is because in a cloudy atmosphere , the overall opacity is slightly higher , so the temperature structure of a converged model with the same outgoing flux will be slightly warmer .    for a cloud - free model atmosphere ,",
    "once the water has condensed out of the atmosphere , there are very few opacity sources left : mainly ch@xmath4 , nh@xmath3 , and collision - induced absorption from molecular hydrogen .",
    "this means that the brown dwarf is quite transparent in those layers and flux is able to emerge from deeper layers . in contrast , if we assume , as we do in our cloudy models , that water in excess of the saturation vapor pressure condenses to form a water ice cloud , that cloud provides a large opacity source , preventing the brown dwarf from efficiently emitting from layers underneath the cloud , and significantly warming the atmosphere .    for model atmospheres between 400 and 500 k , even though the cloud - free p  t profile may cross the water condensation curve , the converged cloudy models ( including the effect of sulfide clouds ) are somewhat warmer and do not cross the water condensation curve , so the model water cloud does not form .",
    "for the warmest effective temperature brown dwarfs in which we find that water clouds form and can exist in radiative equilibrium , ( @xmath51400 k ) , the water clouds are at low pressures within the radiative upper atmosphere .",
    "they remain above the photosphere and optically thin .",
    "this means that the clouds affect the spectra very little , but the converged cloudy model s p ",

    "the opacity of this cloud is not currently included in the models .",

    "co and co@xmath2 are strongly disfavored in equilibrium , but vertical mixing could increase their abundance in the atmosphere by several orders of magnitude , so the strongest absorption bands may still prove to be important for late t and early y dwarfs . for very cold objects , the effects of disequilibrium carbon chemistry should become less important .",
    "species such as ph@xmath3 ( phosphine ) and h@xmath2s , which have been observed in jupiter s atmosphere prinn75 , will also be present in y dwarfs .",
    "phosphine is likely observable in the mid - infrared ; the strongest ph@xmath3 feature is at 4.3  and is the dominant opacity source at that wavelength in the photosphere of a @xmath0=450 k y dwarf .",

    "the wide spectral windows in the water absorption , typical of warmer brown dwarfs , narrow as ammonia and methane increase in abundance in the near - infrared photosphere . as ammonia increases in abundance ,",
    "the weaker ammonia feature between 1 and 1.1  begins to carve away the center of _ y _ band .",
    "for the 300 k model shown in figure [ irspec - zoom ] , the _ y _ band is bifurcated into two peaks by this absorption band .",

    "the water cloud gradually becomes more optically thick .",
    "it first forms quite high in the atmosphere , and influences the mid - infrared from 2.85  where water ice particles absorb most efficiently ( see figure [ ssa ] ) .    for",
    "cold y dwarfs  between 200 - 300 k  the water cloud thickens as the object cools . at effective temperatures of 200",
    "k , it has become quite optically thick : most regions of the near- and mid - infrared have significantly less flux emerging from the cloudy column .",
    "in fact , about 10@xmath54 times less flux emerges at 4.5  from the cloudy column than the cloud - free column .",
    "this picture , where flux is emitted almost entirely through clearer columns of the atmosphere , is similar to jupiter and saturn s deep water clouds , which appear to have holes in the clouds ( the so - called ` 5-micron hot spots ' in jupiter ) through which most of the mid - infrared flux emerges .",
    "interestingly , water ice particles of this size ( 120 ) are very inefficient at absorbing photons with wavelengths shorter than 1.4 , so the @xmath53 and @xmath52 bands are not strongly affected , even in a column with a geometrically optically thick cloud .",
    "it is also instructive to look at models that have the same total amount of flux emitted through model atmospheres with different cloud - covering fraction @xmath25 and different sedimentation efficiency @xmath13 , to understand the sensitivity of our results to our choice of those parameters .",
    "the models presented in figure [ diffcloudcover ] are separate from our main grid , which was run with @xmath24 and @xmath13=5 for all models ; these models instead are run with @xmath25=1.0 , 0.7 , 0.4 , 0.3 , and 0.2 and with @xmath13=3 , 5 , and 7 respectively .",
    "all models have the same amount of total flux emitted as a 200 k blackbody .    in both panels ,",
    "the models look very similar to each other at wavelengths shorter than about 2 , where the water clouds do not strongly absorb . as we increase the cloud fraction ( decrease @xmath25 ) , more flux emerges between 2 and 3.6@xmath55 m and beyond 5.5@xmath55 m .",
    "this additional flux comes at the expense of the peak flux at @xmath56 m .",
    "in essence , increases in cloudiness redistribute this peak flux to other wavelengths .",

    "disequilibrium carbon chemistry was predicted by fegley96 and confirmed in spectra by noll97 and saumon00 .",
    "it is known to be important for brown dwarfs of many temperatures saumon06 , hubeny07 and may be even more significant for young planets konopacky13 .",
    "the atmospheres of cool brown dwarfs should be methane - dominated .",
    "however , the chemical reaction that leads to methane formation is strongly temperature sensitive and becomes very slow at cold temperatures .",
    "if the timescale of mixing in the atmosphere is faster than the timescale for this reaction to occur , carbon will remain in co instead of being converted to the ch@xmath4 favored by equilibrium chemistry ; for very cold objects this will become less important as the region where methane is thermochemically favored will extend very deeply into the atmosphere .",
    "this process has been explored in detail in a number of papers saumon06 , hubeny07 , visscher11 , moses11 .",

    ", we calculate a quench point in the atmosphere where the mixing timescale is equal to the chemical reaction timescale , which is governed by the slowest step of the fastest pathway of the reaction . above the quench point",

    "this has been shown using full kinetics models to be a good approximation in substellar atmospheres visscher11 .",
    "note that in the disequilibrium chemistry calculation we calculate @xmath9  in the convective zone using mixing length theory and vary @xmath9  in the radiative zone as a free parameter , between 10@xmath5810@xmath59 @xmath19/s . in contrast , in the cloud code , we calculate @xmath9  using mixing length theory with a minimum @xmath9  of 10@xmath18 @xmath19/s ; the clouds and chemistry are thus not strictly self - consistent in the radiative region .",
    "the results of these calculations are shown in figure [ diseq ] for three test cases .",
    "for the 450 k model , the disequilibrium model is generally slightly brighter across the near - infrared than the equilibrium model .",
    "this is because in equilibrium , ammonia is strongly thermochemically favored ; out of equilibrium , there is slightly more n@xmath2 , which is not a strong absorber , and slightly less nh@xmath3 , which absorbs strongly across the near - infrared ( see figure [ molopac ] ) . in the mid - infrared ,",
    "the disequilibrium model is slightly brighter around 4  and slightly fainter around 4.6 .",
    "this is due to the increase in co and decrease in ch@xmath4 ; this shift increases absorption from the most prominent co band at 4.5 to 4.9  and decreases absorption from both ch@xmath4 and nh@xmath3 between 3 and 4.4 .",
    "the increase in flux beyond 8  is because of the decrease in nh@xmath3 which is the strongest absorber at those wavelengths .    for the 300 k and 200 k",
    "objects shown in figure [ diseq ] , disequilibrium chemistry of these particular gases becomes less important as the objects cool .",
    "the atmospheres of these colder objects favor ch@xmath4 and nh@xmath3 strongly in equilibrium over a progressively wider proportion of their atmospheres .",
    "this means that even if deeper layers were mixed upwards to the photosphere , those layers would still be dominated by ch@xmath4 and nh@xmath3 .",
    "the shape of the @xmath60 band has been used as an indicator of the increased abundance in ammonia through the t sequence to the y dwarfs as they cool ( see figure 5 from cushing11 ) .",

    "the miri moderate resolution spectrograph has four channels : channel 1 from 5.07.7 , channel 2 from 7.711.9 , channel 3 from 11.918.3 , and channel 4 from 18.328.3 .",
    "figure [ jwst - miri ] shows the sensitivity for each of these bands ; like the nirspec sensitivity limits , these sensitivity lines represent the faintest continuum flux observable with an integration time per channel of 10@xmath18 seconds ( 27.8 hours ) and a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of 10 , and we show example spectra of the same brown dwarf models located 5 pc from earth .",
    "the miri sensitivity at 6.4  is about 10 times less sensitive than the nirspec sensitivity at 5 .",
    "this is due to a combination of instrumental effects , including miri s higher dark current , higher intrinsic spectral resolution , finer spatial sampling , lower quantum efficiency , and additional optics . to obtain the full 528  spectrum without gaps , three separate observations ( using three different settings of the mrs spectrograph )",
    "are needed , so the actual observing time to acquire these spectra is three times as long .",
    "many of the current suite of y dwarfs discovered to date using the _ wise _ data will be easily observable using this instrument .",
    "most of these objects have temperatures between 400500 k and are within 10 pc of the earth dupuy13 , beichman14 .",
    "the @xmath0=450 k model shown in figure [ jwst - miri ] is well above the sensitivity limit for 518.3 .",
    "this will allow us to probe parts of the spectrum where the opacity is dominated by different molecules : water from 57.2 , methane from 7.28.5 , and ammonia from 8.518 .",
    "channel 4 is much less sensitive so a 450 k object is only marginally detectable from 1828.3  with a snr of 10 .",
    "the coldest brown dwarfs will push the sensitivity limits for this instrument .",
    "no objects colder than 300 k have been discovered to date , but if we find such objects , they will be quite challenging to observe .",
    "the highest snr spectra will be from channels 2 and 3 , from 7.718.3 .",
    "this wavelength range is shaped by methane , ammonia , and h@xmath2 cia .",
    "objects below 300 k will be only marginally detectable in channel 1 and not detectable in channel 4 at r@xmath11000 .",
    "binning the spectra to r@xmath1300 would improve sensitivity by a factor of @xmath13 , improving the detection limit for @xmath0=250 k objects and still providing adequate resolution for identifying prominent molecular bands .",
    "the two other main science instruments on _ jwst _  are the near - infrared camera ( nircam ) and near - infrared imager and slitless spectrograph ( niriss ) .",
    "these instruments are somewhat less well - suited to the spectral characterization of the coolest brown dwarfs .",
    "niriss is optimized for high contrast imaging , high resolution imaging of extended sources , and transiting exoplanet measurements ; it also has a wide - field r@xmath1150 slitless spectroscopy mode designed for detecting high redshift emission lines .",
    "however , for the characterization of cool brown dwarfs , sensitivity is the most important feature .",
    "nircam does have a grism mode that will be capable of 2.45  r@xmath12000 slitless spectroscopy .",
    "however , its sensitivity at those wavelengths will be somewhat lower than nirspec s sensitivity .",
    "the lower sensitivity is because nircam uses a slitless grism that is sensitive to sky background across a large field .",
    "this mode is more optimized for precision photometry and stability , making it a powerful instrument for , e.g. , exoplanet transmission spectra and secondary eclipses . for the sensitivity - limited work needed to characterize y dwarfs",
    ", nirspec will be a more suitable instrument .",
    "observing directly - imaged giant planets at the temperatures of y dwarfs ( 200450 k ) will push the limits of current technology .",
    "nonetheless , some current or soon forthcoming instruments specialized for high - contrast imaging will be capable of detecting such planets .",
    "if planets with masses between 1 and 10 m@xmath64 are quite common , systems of a variety of ages will have planets with these temperatures .",
    "depending on the mechanism of formation , a 10 m@xmath64 planet will reach @xmath0=450 k at an age of 12 gyr .",
    "a 5 m@xmath64 planet will reach @xmath0=450 k in 300600 myr ; a 1 m@xmath64 planet in 2030 myr fortney08b .",
    "the current and forthcoming instruments most capable of detecting such planets are the gemini planet imager ( gpi ) , the spectro - polarimetric high - contrast exoplanet research ( sphere ) , and the large binocular telescope adaptive optics system ( lbtao ) .",
    "gpi macintosh06 and sphere beuzit06 are instruments designed for 8-meter class telescopes and optimized for studying young hot giant planets around bright stars",
    ". both will have advanced adaptive optics systems and hope to achieve planet - star flux contrasts between 10@xmath69 and 10@xmath70 .",
    "they will target young stars to find self - luminous planets and expect to find up to dozens of planets in their initial campaign surveys mcbride11 .",
    "predicted gpi contrast curves suggest that it will be capable of @xmath71 contrast for very bright stars ( @xmath72 ) and 10@xmath69 contrast for fainter ( @xmath73 ) targets . in figure",
    "[ gpi - plot ] , a representative value of 1.9@xmath74 is shown , which is the predicted contrast at 1 arcsec separation from a 7th magnitude g0 dwarf . the models shown",
    "are binned to the resolution of gpi in _",
    "band , @xmath75 at 1.65  and are shown as the flux ratio compared to a blackbody with the temperature and radius of a g0 dwarf .",
    "the @xmath0=450 k planet is detectable above the contrast limits in the spectral regions where the planet is bright .",
    "cooler planets ( @xmath0=350 , 250 k ) will be too faint to observe around a g dwarf .",
    "the lbtao system includes a high - contrast imaging instrument optimized for the mid - infrared .",
    "it is capable of 4.8@xmath76 contrast in _ l _",
    "band skemer14 for a bright star and has six narrow band filters spanning 3.04 to 3.78 .",
    "this spectral region is particularly useful for two reasons : first , the planet - star flux ratio is much higher for cool planets in _",
    "l _ and _ m _ bands .",
    "second , this spectral region spans the most prominent methane feature at 3.3 , allowing for the characterization of a prominent atmospheric component . for example",
    "skemer13 used this instrument to observe the hr 8799 system and find that the planets do not have strong methane absorption , inferring that methane must be in disequilibrium .",
    "similar to gpi , a 450 k planet around a g dwarf would be detectable with lbtao but a 350 or 250 k planet around a g dwarf would not be .",
    "note that , because it operates in the mid - infrared where the sky is bright , the lbtao system is also background limited ; it can only observe objects brighter than @xmath118th magnitude in l@xmath77 .",
    "this limit approximately corresponds to a 350 k object at 10 pc .",
    "more distant objects will therefore be background limited ; closer objects will be contrast limited .",
    "the leech campaign is currently using this instrument to survey stars in the solar neighborhood and discover new planets skemer14 .",
    "discrepancies between models and observations may indicate that the physics or ingredients in the model are either incorrect or incomplete .",
    "for example , there are many sources of uncertainty in the molecular opacity databases .",
    "alkali opacity uncertainties may affect the optical and near - infrared .",
    "the handful of y dwarfs that have observed @xmath62 color suggest that these objects are bluer in this color than the models .",
    "this spectral region is controlled in part by the decline of the strongly pressure - broadened alkali opacity , so this mismatch could be due to the treatment used for the alkali opacity . for these calculations , we use the line broadening treatment outlined in burrows00b , which is somewhat _ ad hoc _ and potentially creates some inaccuracies in the model flux in @xmath52 and @xmath53 bands . a calculation of the molecular potentials for potassium and sodium in these high pressure environments , as is carried out in allard05 , allard07 , would improve the accuracy of these models .",
    "subsolar metallicities also make @xmath62 colors bluer mace13a , burrows06 , so it is important to model the opacity correctly to interpret metallicity measurements using this spectral region .",
    "another known source of opacity uncertainty is in the methane line list ; the list used in this study is known to be incomplete .",
    "the new line list from yurchenko13 and yurchenko14 has over nine billion lines and will vastly improve accuracy of the treatment of methane .",
    "it is possible that we may be missing important physical processes in our models that occur in actual y dwarfs . for example",
    ", an assumption we make when calculating the spectra is that the atmospheres are in radiative  convective equilibrium .",
    "it is inevitable that real brown dwarf atmospheres have higher levels of complexity than these simple assumptions .",
    "the upper atmospheres of brown dwarfs could be heated by a similar mechanism to that which creates jupiter s thermosphere , in which energy is deposited high in the atmosphere by dissipation of gravity waves young97 .",
    "if indeed the upper atmosphere is hotter than radiative  convective equilibrium models , this would change the observed spectrum . using mid - infrared spectra of l dwarfs , sorahana14",
    "show that several l dwarf spectra can be fit significantly better using a model that allows for this upper atmospheric heating .",
    "in fact , in our equilibrium models the [ 3.6]@xmath78[4.5 ] color is redder by @xmath11 magnitude at some @xmath0 ; simple preliminary models in which we change the p ",
    "t profile of the upper atmosphere show that heating high in the atmosphere increases the flux within the methane band centered at 3.3 , which makes the [ 3.6]@xmath78[4.5 ] color bluer , and closer to the observed colors .",
    "another limitation of this study is that the models here include only solar abundances .",
    "we expect y dwarfs and exoplanets to have a range of metallicities and potentially a range of other abundance ratios such as non - solar c / o ratios .",
    "future work will be needed to analyze the effect of abundances on y dwarf spectra and colors .",
    "we consider disequilibrium chemistry of n@xmath2/nh@xmath3 and co / ch@xmath4 , but other molecules such as ph@xmath3 and co@xmath2 may also be out of chemical equilibrium . such unmodeled chemistry could change abundances of molecules we do include , or create additional molecules that we do not include in the calculations .    as 1d models , these calculations naturally do not include the effect of 3d dynamics on the cloud structure .",
    "the breakup of the iron and silicate clouds at the l / t transition is a source of continued study ; due to dynamical processes , those clouds dissipate at higher temperatures than 1d cloud settling models predict .",
    "as the sulfide and salt clouds sink more deeply into the atmosphere as the brown dwarf cools , they may also break up and disappear from spectra at higher temperatures than our treatment predicts .",
    "further study , including dynamical effects , will be necessary to understand this phenomenon across the brown dwarf spectral sequence .      to our knowledge ,",
    "the only previous comprehensive set of models analyzed and published for y dwarfs including water clouds using a cloud model were those in burrows03b .",
    "our approaches and results are overall very similar ; we assume chemical equilibrium , radiative  convective equilibrium , incorporate a cloud model , and publish spectra and colors of the coolest brown dwarfs . like burrows03b",
    ", we predict the growing importance of methane and ammonia absorption over the t to y sequence , the weakening of the alkali absorption , and a reversal in the blueward trend in near - ir colors of the t dwarfs around 400 k. our spectra differ in details due largely to changes in the line lists over the past decade ; we have continuously improved our opacity database over the last ten years freedman08 .",
    "most relevant here , we are using updated treatments for both ammonia ( which becomes very important for y dwarfs ) and h@xmath2 collision - induced absorption .",
    "one of the conclusions presented in burrows03b is that the water clouds do not significantly affect the spectra of y dwarfs and it is on this point that we differ most significantly .",
    "the differences lie in our treatment of the cloud model for the water clouds .",
    "burrows03b uses the cloud model presented in cooper03 , which results in a uniform distribution of very large particles ( 20150 ) within a single pressure scale height .",
    "since our cloud particles are much smaller ( @xmath11 - 20 ) , we have far more particles to create a cloud of the same mass .",
    "this means that when our water cloud forms , it is much more optically thick . for a more detailed comparison of the cloud models themselves",
    "see marley03 which describes the challenges of modeling clouds in brown dwarfs and the problems inherent to different approaches .",
    "wisepa j182831.08 + 265037.8 ( hereafter wisep j1828 + 2650 ) is a particularly interesting object .",
    "its near - infrared colors are inconsistent with the models and with the other y dwarfs .",
    "the peculiarities of the near - infrared colors and comparisons to models led cushing11 and kirkpatrick12 to classify it as a > y0 and >",
    "y2 respectively ; comparisons to models gave cushing11 a temperature estimate of @xmath0@xmath79300 k. however , for a brown dwarf that cold to have the measured mid - infrared luminosity , it would need to have an unphysically large radius , leading leggett13 to suggest that it is an unresolved binary .",
    "dupuy13 revised the parallax measurement and found that based on its luminosity , wisep j1828 + 2650 likely has a temperature closer to the late t dwarfs , 500600 k , and that even if it is a binary , those components must still be 400500 k.    using the models presented here , it is not possible to fit all of the near - infrared colors of wisep j1828 + 2650 using a lower gravity model .",
    "for example , the models predict that a brighter _ j _ band flux and corresponding bluer @xmath6 color at lower gravity , due to the decreased strength of the alkali absorption in a lower gravity photosphere , whereas for this object we observe an extremely red @xmath6 color .",
    "additional spectroscopic data at near- and mid - infrared wavelengths will be required to determine whether wisep j1828 + 2650 is indeed a prototypical @xmath0@xmath79300 k y dwarf , or a peculiar version of the t8y0 spectral classes .",
    "as brown dwarfs approach the effective temperatures of the solar system s planets , volatile clouds will form in their atmospheres .",
    "the first and most massive type of volatile cloud that forms is water ice clouds .",
    "water ice clouds form in objects cooler than effective temperatures of @xmath1400 k. in order to converge atmospheric temperature structures self - consistently with both clouds and chemistry , we calculate models in which , like water clouds in the solar system planets , the clouds heterogeneously cover the surface ( `` patchy '' clouds ) . our model grid covers the y dwarf spectral class as well as giant planets with the same effective temperatures , from @xmath0=200450 k and log g=3.05.0 .      \\1 . while water condenses high in the atmospheres of all objects below @xmath0@xmath1400 k , these clouds do not become optically thick until the object has cooled to 350375 k. this result means that for the current set of y dwarfs warmer than 400 k , water clouds will not strongly effect their spectra .",
    "water clouds , unlike other clouds in brown dwarf atmospheres , are very much non - gray absorbers . using the am01 cloud model , water ice particle sizes range from @xmath1120 . for these particle sizes",
    ", the ice particles are strongly scattering in the optical through _ j _ band and do not change the spectra significantly at those wavelengths .",
    "the ice particles absorb strongly in the infrared with prominent features , the strongest of which is at 2.8 .",
    "h@xmath2o , nh@xmath3 , ch@xmath4 , and h@xmath2 cia are the dominant opacity sources in y dwarf atmospheres .",
    "less abundant species such as ph@xmath3 may also be observable at 44.6 , as well as h@xmath2s in _ h _ and _ y _ bands and the alkalis in the optical .",

    "k objects will be observable across their near- and mid - infrared spectra , and even @xmath0=200 k objects will be observable in the spectral window region between 3.8 and 5.0  and at some wavelengths between 8 and 17 .",
