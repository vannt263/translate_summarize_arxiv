    "with the foreseen exponentially increasing number of users and traffic in 4 g and lte / lte - advanced ( lte - a ) systems @xcite , existing deployment and practice of cellular radio networks that strongly rely on highly hierarchical architectures with centralized control and resource management becomes economically unsustainable .",
    "network self - organization and self - optimization are among the key targets of future cellular networks so as to relax the heavy demand of human efforts in the network planning and optimization tasks and to reduce the system s capital and operational expenditure ( capex / opex ) @xcite .",
    "the next - generation mobile networks are expected to provide a full coverage of broadband wireless service and support fair and efficient resource utilization with a high degree of operation autonomy and system intelligence @xcite .",
    "in addition , energy efficiency has emerged as an important concern for future mobile networks .",
    "it is expected that energy consumption by the information and communications technology ( ict ) industry will be rising at @xmath0 per year @xcite , and hence energy bills will become an important portion of operational expenditure . to reduce the impacts on both revenue and environment caused by energy consumption , while providing satisfactory services to customers , a mechanism that jointly improves spectrum and energy efficiency for self - organizing networks is needed .    in this paper",
    ", we study the problem of self - organizing heterogeneous lte systems and aim to achieve both spectrum and energy efficiency . we propose a generic model that jointly takes into account the key characteristics of today s lte networks @xcite , including the usage of orthogonal frequency division multiple access ( ofdma ) in the air interface , the nature of frequency - selective fading for each link , multi - cell multi - link interference occured , and the different transmission ( power ) capabilities of different types of base stations , which could be macro and small cells @xcite .",
    "we also consider the cost of energy by taking into account the power consumption , including that for wireless transmission and that for the operation of base stations .",
    "based on this unified model , we propose a distributed protocol that improves the spectrum efficiency of the system , which one can apply weighted proportional fairness among the throughputs of clients , and reduces the cost of energy .",
    "our protocol consists of four components .",
    "first , each base station needs to make scheduling decisions for its clients .",
    "second , each base station needs to allocate transmission powers on different frequencies by considering the influence on the throughputs of its clients , the interference caused on others , and the cost of energy .",
    "third , each client needs to choose a suitable base station to be associated with .",
    "finally , each base station needs to determine whether to be in active mode and serve clients , or to be in sleep mode to improve energy efficiency .",
    "we propose an online scheduling policy for the first component and shows that it achieves globally optimum performance when the solutions to the other three components are fixed .",
    "we also propose distributed strategies for the other three components and show that each of them achieves locally optimal performance under some mild approximation of the system .",
    "we show that these strategies only require small computational and communicational overheads , and hence are easily implementable . moreover , these strategies take the interactions of different components into account .",
    "thus , an integrated solution that applies all these strategies jointly consider all factors of heterogeneous lte systems .",
    "we also conduct extensive simulations .",
    "simulation results verify that each of the proposed strategies improves system performance .",
    "they also show that the integrated solution achieve much better performance than existing policies in a large scale heterogeneous network .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ section : related ] summarizes existing work .",
    "section  [ section : system_model ] describes the system model and problem setup .",
    "section  [ section : scheduling ] presents the online scheduling policy for the first component .",
    "section  [ section : power ] introduces a distributed heuristic for the second component . section  [",

    "finally , section  [ section : conclusion ] concludes the paper .",
    "there has been some work on self - organized wireless systems . chen and baccelli @xcite",
    "has proposed a distributed algorithm for the self optimization of radio resources that aims to achieve potential delay fairness .",
    "hu et al @xcite has proposed a distributed protocol for load balancing among base stations .",
    "borst , markakis , and saniee @xcite studies the problem of utility maximization for self - organizing networks for arbitrary utility functions .",
    "lopez - perez et al @xcite , hou and gupta @xcite , and hou and chen @xcite have considered the problems of jointly optimizing different components in self - organizing networks under various system models .",
    "these works do not take energy efficient into considerations .    on the other hand , techniques for improving cellular radio energy efficiency",
    "have recently attracted much attention .",
    "auer et al @xcite has investigated the amount of power consumptions for various types of base stations .",
    "mclaughlin et al @xcite has discussed various techniques for improving energy efficiency .",
    "conte et al @xcite has proposed to turn base stations to sleep mode when the network traffic is small to save energy .",
    "son et al @xcite , zhou et al @xcite , and gong , zhou , and niu @xcite have proposed various policies of allocating clients so that clients are mostly allocated to a few base stations . as a result , many base stations that do not have any clients can be turned to sleep mode to save energy .",
    "however , these studies require the knowledge of traffic of each client , and can not be applied to scenarios where clients traffic is elastic .",
    "chen et al @xcite has studied the trade - off between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency .",
    "miao et al @xcite and li et al @xcite have provided extensive surveys on energy - efficient wireless communications .",
    "however , they do not consider the interference and interactions between base stations , and are hence not applicable to self - organizing networks .",
    "consider a reuse-1 radio system with several base stations and clients that operate and use lte ofdma .",
    "the base stations can be of different types , including macro , micro , pico , and femto base stations .",
    "lte divides frequency bandwidth into subcarriers , and time into frames , which are further divided into 20 time slots .",
    "the bandwidth of a subcarrier is 15  khz while the duration of a time frame is 10  ms . in this paper",
    ", we consider lte frequency division duplex ( fdd ) , the downlink transmission , and resource scheduling . in lte ,",
    "a resource block consists of 12 consecutive subcarriers and one time slot of duration 0.5  ms . under the ofdma",
    ", each user can be allocated any number of resource blocks . however , for each base station , a resource block can not be allocated to more than one user .",
    "lte can thus achieve both time - division multiplexing and frequency - division multiplexing .",
    "we hereby define @xmath1 to be the set of base stations , @xmath2 to be the set of clients , and @xmath3 to be set of resource blocks , where each @xmath4 represents a collection of 12 consecutive subcarriers and each @xmath5 represents a time slot . in the sequel , we use both @xmath6 and @xmath7 to denote a resource block for the notational convenience . note that here we consider reuse-1 systems .",
    "however , the result could be extended to other systems .",
    "we consider the energy consumptions of base stations by breaking them into two categories : _ operation power _ and _ transmission power_. when a base station has no clients to serve , the base station can be turned into sleep mode to save power . on the other hand , when the base station has some clients associated to it , it needs to remain in active mode .",
    "in addition to transmission power , a base station in active mode also consumes more power for computation , cooling , etc , than one in sleep mode .",
    "we call the sum of energy consumption other than transmission power as the _ operation power_. we denote by @xmath8 as the difference of operation powers consumed when base station @xmath9 is in active mode and when it is in sleep mode .",
    "we denote by @xmath10 the amount of transmission power that a base station @xmath9 assigns on resource block @xmath11 .",
    "if base station @xmath12 does not operate in resource block @xmath11 , we have @xmath13 .",
    "the time - average transmission power consumed base station @xmath12 can then be expressed as @xmath14 .",
    "further , we assume that each base station @xmath12 has a fixed power budget @xmath15 for every time slot , and it is required that @xmath16 , for all @xmath12 and @xmath17 , which is also known as the per base station transmit power constraint .",
    "we note that the values of @xmath8 and @xmath15 can be different from base station to base station , as different types of base stations may consume different amounts of operation powers and have different power budgets .",
    "for example , a macro base station has a much larger @xmath8 and @xmath15 than a femto base station .    propagation loss and path condition",
    "are captured by the channel gain .",
    "note that in each resource block , one can consider that the channel gain is usually flat over the subcarriers given that the channel coherence bandwidth is greater than 180 khz ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.12 ) .",
    "it is also time invariant in each time slot given that the channel coherence time is greater than 0.5 ms ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch.23 ) .",
    "however , the channel gain of a user may change from one resource block to another in the frequency and time domain .",
    "let @xmath18 be the channel gain between base station @xmath12 and client @xmath19 on resource block @xmath11 . to be more specific , when the base station @xmath12 transmits with power @xmath10 , the received power at client @xmath19 on resource block @xmath11 is @xmath20 .",
    "the received power , @xmath20 , of client @xmath19 is considered to be its received signal strength if base station @xmath12 is transmitting data to client @xmath19 , and is considered to be interference , otherwise .",
    "therefore , when base station @xmath12 is transmitting data to client @xmath19 on resource block @xmath11 , the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) of client @xmath19 on @xmath11 is expressible as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the thermal noise experienced by client @xmath19 on resource block @xmath11 .",
    "the throughput of this transmission can then be described by the shannon capacity as @xmath23 , where @xmath24 is the bandwidth of a resource block .",
    "each client @xmath19 is associated with one base station @xmath25 . in each frame ,",
    "base station @xmath12 schedules one client that is associated with @xmath12 in each of the resource blocks in the frame . the base station may change the client scheduled in a particular resource block from frame to frame .",
    "let @xmath26 be the proportion of frames that client @xmath19 is scheduled in resource block @xmath11 by base station @xmath12 .",
    "to simplify problem formulation , we assume that @xmath18 does not vary over time",
    ". we will then discuss in the following sections how to take channel time variation into account .",
    "the influence of channel fading is also demonstrated by simulations in section [ section : simulation ] .",
    "consider that @xmath18 does not vary over the time , the overall throughput of client @xmath19 , which is the sum of its throughput over all the resource blocks , can hence be written as : @xmath27    in this work , we aim to jointly achieve both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency by considering the tradeoff between them . for spectrum efficiency , we aim to achieve weighted proportional fairness among all the clients when the cost of total power consumption is fixed .",
    "let @xmath28 be the priority weight of client @xmath19 or user - dependent priority indicator .",
    "the weighted proportional fairness can be achieved by maximizing @xmath29 .",
    "on the other hand , we also aim to minimize the cost of total power consumption .",
    "we denote by @xmath30 as the price of energy for base station @xmath12 .",
    "we then formulate the problem of joint spectrum and energy efficiency as the following optimization problem : @xmath31    there are three terms involved in the objective function ( [ equation : introduction : c0 ] ) . the first term",
    ", @xmath29 can be called as the _ weighted proportional fairness index _ , as the system achieves weighted proportional fairness by maximizing it .",
    "the second term , @xmath32 , is the cost of power consumption on transmission powers of all base stations . in the last term",
    ", we note that a base station is only active when it has at least one client , hence , @xmath33 , is the cost of power consumption on operation powers of all base stations . in sum",
    ", we aim to maximize @xmath34weighted proportional fairness index@xmath35total cost of power consumption@xmath36 .",
    "in particular , we note that if any of the clients are not covered , i.e. , @xmath37 , for some @xmath19 , then the value of ( [ equation : introduction : c0 ] ) is @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , by aiming at maximizing ( [ equation : introduction : c0 ] ) , we also guarantee that all clients are covered .",
    "there are two constraints in the formulation .",
    "( [ equation : introduction : c1 ] ) states that , for each base station , it can only allocate a resource block to one client in each frame .",
    "however , for a fixed resource block , the base station may change the client that it is allocated to from frame to frame .",
    "the second constraint , ( [ equation : introduction : c2 ] ) , states that the total amount of power that a base station allocates on all subcarriers can not exceed its power budget .",
    "the variables that we are able to control are listed in ( [ equation : introduction : c3 ] ) and ( [ equation : introduction : c4 ] ) , which include the base station that each client is associated to , @xmath39 , the transmission power that each base station allocates on each resource block , @xmath10 , and the scheduling decision of each base station on each resource block , @xmath40 .",
    "finally , we note that a base station only needs to be in active mode when at least one client is associated with it , and can be in sleep mode when no clients are associated with it .",
    "therefore , the decision on whether a base station is in sleep mode or in active mode is implicitly determined by the choices of @xmath39 , for all @xmath19 .",
    "this formulation shows that there are several important components involved . in each frame",
    ", a base station needs to decide which client should be scheduled in each resource block .",
    "this essentially determines the values of @xmath40 so as to maximize @xmath29 .",
    "we call this component the _ scheduling problem_. in each frame , a base station also needs to decide how much power it should allocate in each resource block , subject to the constraint on its power budget . this component is referred as the _ power control problem_. the power control problem influences both the spectrum efficiency , @xmath29 , and the cost of transmission power , @xmath41 . besides , every client needs to choose an active base station to be associated with .",
    "base stations also need to decide whether to be in active mode to serve clients , or to be in sleep mode to save energy .",
    "we denote both the clients decisions on associated base stations and base stations decisions on whether to be in active or sleep mode as the _ client association problem _ , as these two components are tightly related .",
    "hence , the client association problem influences both spectrum efficiency and the total cost of operation power , @xmath33 .",
    "further , we notice that there is a natural timescale separation between the three components : the scheduling problem is updated on a per time slot basis . on the other hand ,",
    "the power control problem is updated in a slower timescale .",
    "finally , the client association problem must only be updated infrequently , as the overheads for clients to change the associated base stations , and for the base stations to switch between sleep / active mode are large . in the following ,",
    "we first propose an online algorithm for the scheduling problem , given solutions to the power control problem and the client association problem .",
    "we then propose a heuristic for the power control problem by considering solutions to the scheduling problem .",
    "finally , we develop a protocol for the client association problem .",
    "the protocol uses the knowledge of the power control problem as well as the influences on the scheduling problem .",
    "figure [ fig : overview ] illustrates an overview of our approach and the timescales of different components .",
    "in this section , we study the scheduling problem , given solutions to the power control problem and the client association problem , i.e. , values of @xmath10 and @xmath39 .",
    "we thus define @xmath42 which is the throughput of client @xmath19 on resource block @xmath11 when it is scheduled by base station @xmath39 , to simplify the notations . with @xmath10 and @xmath39",
    "fixed , solving ( [ equation : introduction : c0])-([equation : introduction : c4 ] ) is equivalent to solving the following : @xmath43    one can see that the above optimization problem is in fact convex and hence can be solved by standard techniques of convex optimization . to further simplify the computation overhead , we propose an online scheduling policy for the scheduling problem .",
    "let @xmath44 $ ] be the proportion of frames that base station @xmath39 has scheduled client @xmath19 for resource block @xmath11 in the first @xmath45 frames .",
    "similarly , let @xmath46=\\sum_{z\\in\\mathbb{z}}\\phi_{i , m(i),z}[k]h_{i , m(i),z}$ ] be the average throughput of client @xmath19 in the first @xmath47 frames .",
    "we then have @xmath48   = \\frac{k-1}{k}\\phi_{i , m(i),z}[k]+\\frac{1}{k}$ ] , if client @xmath19 is scheduled for @xmath11 in the @xmath49-th frame , and @xmath48   =   \\frac{k-1}{k}\\phi_{i , m(i),z}[k],$ ] otherwise .    in our online scheduling policy , the base station schedules the client @xmath19 that maximizes @xmath50 $ ] .",
    "this is indeed the well - known proportional fair scheduling @xcite , and it has been shown that , when the solutions to the power control problem and the client association problem are fixed , the online scheduling policy converges to the optimal solution to the scheduling problem .",
    "[ theorem : scheduling : optimal ] using the above scheduling policy , the value of @xmath51 $ ] achieves the maximum of the optimization problem ( [ equation : scheduling : c0])([equation : scheduling : c2 ] ) .",
    "note that in the previous discussions , we have assumed that the channel gain , @xmath18 , does not vary over time . in practice",
    ", however , channel gains fluctuate due to fading . to take fading into account , we let @xmath52 be the instantaneous time - varying channel gain , and @xmath53 be the instantaneous throughput that client @xmath19 can get from resource block @xmath11 if it is scheduled by base station @xmath39 .",
    "our scheduling policy can then be easily modified such that the base station schedules the client with the largest @xmath54 $ ] on resource block @xmath11 . in section [ section : simulation ] , we show that this modification can further improve performance .",
    "in this section , we discuss the power control problem , i.e. , how the base stations choose @xmath10 so as to solve ( [ equation : introduction : c0])([equation : introduction : c4 ] ) .    obviously , base stations need to know the solution of the scheduling problem @xmath55 and the values of channel gains @xmath56 , in order to choose suitable @xmath10 . to reduce computation and communication overhead and maintain operational simplicity , the base stations assume that for all clients @xmath19 associated with base station @xmath12 , the perceived thermal noises are all @xmath57 , the channel gains between them and base station @xmath12 are all @xmath58 , and the channel gains between them and base station @xmath59 are all @xmath60 on resource block @xmath11 . in practice ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath58 can be set to be the average value of the noise powers and the average value of the channel gains between @xmath12 and its clients , respectively , and @xmath60 can be set to be the channel gain between base station @xmath12 and base station @xmath61 on resource block @xmath11 . under this assumption , one can see that the optimal solution to the scheduling problem ( [ equation : scheduling : c0])([equation : scheduling : c2 ] ) is given by : @xmath62    let @xmath63 be the sum weight of the clients that are associated with base station @xmath12 . under a fixed solution to the client association problem and the above approximation to the scheduling problem , ( [ equation : introduction : c0])-([equation : introduction : c4 ] ) can be rewritten as : @xmath64    this problem is non - convex and it may be infeasible to find the global optimal solution . instead , we propose a distributed heuristic that employs the gradient method , which converges to a local optimum@xcite .",
    "let @xmath65 be the vector consisting of @xmath66 , @xmath67 and @xmath68- \\sum_{m\\in\\mathbb{m},z\\in\\mathbb{z}}\\zeta_mp_{m , z}/|\\mathbb{q}|.$ ] we have : @xmath69-\\zeta_m/|\\mathbb{q}|.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    each base station updates its power periodically .",

    "base station @xmath12 needs to compute @xmath73 to update its power on each resource block .",
    "the computation of @xmath74 can be further simplified by setting @xmath75 for all @xmath76 such that @xmath77 is small and has little influence on the value of @xmath74 .",
    "thus , to compute @xmath74 , base station @xmath12 exchanges information with base station @xmath76 that is physically close to it so as to know :    * the sum weight of clients associated with @xmath76 , i.e. , @xmath78 , * the channel gain @xmath77 from @xmath12 to @xmath76 , * the sum of interference and noise @xmath79 at @xmath76 , * the received signal strength @xmath80 at @xmath76 , and * the average total throughput @xmath81 in the downlink of base station  @xmath76 ,    for all @xmath76 that @xmath77 is large . in lte , the above information can be obtained through periodic channel quality indicator and reference signal reports .",
    "this method is easy to implement and only requires limited information exchange between neighbor cells .",
    "we assume that the neighbor cell communication takes place between base stations and is supported by the wired backhaul network .",
    "in the following , we discuss how to solve the client association problem , i.e. , how each client @xmath19 should choose a base station @xmath39 .",
    "our solution consists of two parts : in the first part , each client @xmath19 estimates its throughput when it associates with each base station .",
    "the client @xmath19 then selfishly chooses the base station that maximizes its throughput . in the second part",
    ", each base station decides whether to be in active mode or in sleep mode by jointly considering the effects on spectrum efficiency and energy consumption .",
    "we assume that each client @xmath19 is selfish and would like to choose a base station @xmath12 that maximizes its own throughput when it is associated with @xmath12 .",
    "we make this assumption under two main reasons .",
    "first , this conforms to the selfish behaviors of clients .",
    "second , in a dense network , the decision of @xmath39 by one client @xmath19 only has a limited and indirect impact on the overall performance of other clients .",
    "we define @xmath82 as in ( [ equation : scheduling : h ] ) , and @xmath83 be the proportion of frames that base station @xmath12 would schedule @xmath19 if @xmath19 is associated with @xmath12 .",
    "the client @xmath19 then selects the base station @xmath12 that maximizes @xmath84    in practice , client @xmath19 can only be associated with base stations that are in active mode and whose @xmath82 is above some threshold for some @xmath6 . to compute @xmath85 for all such base stations , client",
    "@xmath19 needs to know the values of @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",
    "client @xmath19 assumes that the transmission powers used by base stations are not influenced much by its choice , which is true in a dense network .",
    "thus , client @xmath19 only needs to know its perceived sinr with each base station on each resource block to compute @xmath82 .",
    "it remains for the client @xmath19 to compute the value of @xmath83 .",
    "we propose two different approaches to compute this value . in the first approach , which we call the _ exact simulator _ ( es ) , client",
    "@xmath19 first obtains the values of @xmath86 and @xmath87 for all clients @xmath88 that are associated with @xmath12 .",
    "client @xmath19 can then simulates the scheduling decisions of base station @xmath12 by running the online scheduling policy introduced in section [ section : scheduling ] , and obtains the value of @xmath83 on each resource block @xmath11 .",
    "while this approach offers an accurate estimation on @xmath83 and @xmath85 , it requires high computation and communication overhead .    in the second approach , which we call",
    "the _ approximate estimator _ ( ae ) ,",
    "client @xmath19 only obtains the values of @xmath89 , and @xmath90 which is the average throughput of base station @xmath12 on resource block @xmath11 .",
    "client @xmath19 assumes that , when another client @xmath88 is scheduled by base station @xmath12 on resource block @xmath11 , its throughput on @xmath11 equals the average throughput @xmath91 .",
    "client @xmath19 can then estimate @xmath92 by _ algorithm  [ algorithm : client : ae]_. the complexity of _ algorithm  [ algorithm : client : ae ] _ is @xmath93 , and therefore this approach is much more efficient than the exact simulator .",
    "moreover , the following theorem suggests that the approximate simulator provides reasonably good estimates on the throughput of client @xmath19 if it is associated with base station @xmath12 .",
    "sort all resource blocks such that @xmath94 + @xmath95 @xmath96 @xmath97 +    @xmath98 + @xmath99 + @xmath100 break @xmath101 + @xmath102 + @xmath103 break @xmath85    [ theorem : client : ae ] if for each client @xmath88 other than @xmath19 that is associated @xmath12 , @xmath104 , then , under the online scheduling policy introduced in section [ section : scheduling ] , the throughput of client @xmath19 equals the value of @xmath85 obtained by algorithm [ algorithm : client : ae ] when it is also associated with @xmath12",
    ".    please refer to appendix b for the proof .",
    "after obtaining the value of @xmath85 , client @xmath19 selects @xmath105 and associates with base station @xmath39",
    ". moreover , client @xmath19 reports the estimated rate with @xmath39 , @xmath106 , and the second largest estimated rate among all base stations , @xmath107 , to @xmath39 .",
    "we define @xmath108 , and hence @xmath109 .",
    "these values are used for base stations to decide whether to switch to sleep mode , which is discussed in the following section .    in summary ,",
    "when the approximate estimator is applied , each base station @xmath12 only needs to periodically broadcasts a total number of @xmath110 values , that is , the values of @xmath111 , from which each client @xmath19 can compute @xmath112 , and @xmath91 for all @xmath6 . on the other hand ,",
    "when a client @xmath19 decides to be associated with a base station @xmath39 , it only needs to report two values : @xmath106 and @xmath113 .",
    "thus , the communication overhead for the approximate estimator is small .",
    "we now discuss how base stations decide whether to be in active mode or in sleep mode .",
    "the protocol consists of two parts : one for a base station in active mode to decide whether to switch to sleep mode , and one for a base station in sleep mode to decide whether to switch to active mode .",
    "first , consider a base station @xmath114 that is in active mode .",
    "given the solution to the power control problem , @xmath114 aims to maximize @xmath115 , where @xmath116 is the indicator function .",
    "when @xmath114 is in active mode , it estimates that @xmath117 , which is the estimated throughput that client @xmath19 reports to @xmath114 as discussed in the previous section .",
    "therefore , we have : @xmath118 on the other hand , when @xmath114 is in sleep mode , it assumes that its clients will be associated with the base station other than @xmath114 that provides the largest throughput , and the resulting throughput of client @xmath19 will be @xmath113 .",
    "we then have : @xmath119 the base station @xmath114 simply compares the values of ( [ equation : client : active to sleep 1 ] ) and of ( [ equation : client : active to sleep 2 ] ) .",
    "if the latter is larger than the former , @xmath114 switches to sleep mode .",
    "next , consider a base station @xmath120 that is in sleep mode .",

    "@xcite has investigated the amount of power needed to operate a base station .",
    "it has shown that a macro base station consumes 75w when it is in sleep mode , and consumes 130w when it is in active mode .",
    "therefore , we set the operation power of a macro base station to be 55w .",
    "it has also shown that the power budget of a macro base station is 20w .",
    "similarly , we set the operation power and transmission power budget of a micro base station to be 17w and 6.3w , respectively .",
    "we have implemented the proposed online scheduling policy , power control , and approximate estimator .",
    "we compare our mechanisms against other mechanisms .",
    "we consider two policies for the scheduling problem , round - robin ( _ rr _ ) and the scheduling policy proposed in section [ section : scheduling ] ( _ pf _ ) .",
    "for the power control problem , we assume that other mechanisms use the same amount of power on each resource block .",
    "we consider two policies for the client association problem .",
    "one of the policies associate each client to the closest base station , and is called _",
    "default_. the other policy adapts the ones proposed in son et al @xcite and zhou et al @xcite . in this policy , which we call _ son - zhou _ , each client @xmath19 chooses to be associated with the base station @xmath12 that maximizes \\{data rate of @xmath19 when served by @xmath12}@xmath156\\{number of clients associated @xmath12}/\\{operation power of @xmath12}. the intuition is that clients prefer to be associated with base stations with many clients . as a result",
    ", some of the base stations will have very few clients and can be turned into sleep mode .",
    "we assume that a base station is turned into sleep mode if the total weight of its clients is below a certain threshold .",
    "we have exhaustively evaluated the performance of son - zhou using different thresholds and found that setting the threshold to be 2 achieves the best performance under all evaluated price of energy .",
    "hence , we set the threshold to be 2 .",
    "we compare the performance of different mechanisms by their resulting values of ( [ equation : introduction : c0 ] ) , where the throughput of a client , @xmath92 , is measured in kbits / sec .",
    "we also evaluate and present the achieved total weighted throughput , defined as @xmath157 , total power consumption , and/or energy efficiency of each mechanism under various scenarios .",
    "we first consider a system with one macro base station and 25 clients to demonstrate the performance of our solution to the scheduling problem .",
    "clients are uniformly placed as a @xmath158 grid , where the distance between adjacent clients is 100 m .",
    "we compare the rr policy against our pf policy , where we consider both cases when the base station has instant knowledge of channel gains and where base stations only have knowledge of long - term average channel gains , denoted by _",
    "fast feedback _ and _ slow feedback _ , respectively .",
    "we set the price of energy , @xmath30 , to be zero for this system , as we are only interested in the performance of scheduling policies .",
    "figure [ fig : scheduling_performance ] and figure [ fig : scheduling_throughput ] show the simulation results on both the values of ( [ equation : introduction : c0 ] ) and the total throughput of the system .",
    "it is observed that both fast feedback and slow feedback achieve more than 50% higher throughput than the rr policy , as they both use knowledge on channel gains for scheduling decisions .",
    "fast feedback has better performance than slow feedback since it takes effects of fast fading into account .",
    "next , we demonstrate the performance of our solution to the power control problem .",
    "we consider a system with two macro base stations .",
    "each of these base stations has two clients associated with it , and the distance between a client and its associated base station is 50 m .",
    "we compare a policy that uses both our scheduling policy and power control algorithm against one that only uses our scheduling policy and allocates equal power on all resource blocks .",
    "we consider the performance of the two policies by varying the distance between the two base stations .",
    "we also set the price of energy to be zero for this system .",
    "simulation results are shown in figure [ fig : power_performance ] and figure [ fig : power_throughput ] .",
    "it is observed that when the two base stations are far apart , the two policies achieve similar performance .",
    "however , as the distance between the two base stations decreases , the performance of the policy without power control degrades greatly , as it suffers much from the interference between the two base stations . on the other hand , by using our power control algorithm , the two base stations start to operate in disjoint resource blocks as the distance between them decreases .",
    "hence , the performance of the policy using power control does not suffer too much from interference .",
    "we now consider the client association problem .",
    "we consider a system with two macro base stations that are separated by 500 m .",
    "there are four clients uniformly distributed between them .",
    "we consider the performance of our proposed mechanism under various price of energy .",
    "simulation results are shown in figure [ fig : association_performance ] .",
    "we can see that when the price is small , the performance of the system degrades quickly with price",
    ". however , at a price of 0.06 , the performance increases , and then degrades with price , but with a smaller slope .",
    "this is because , at a price of 0.06 , our mechanism determines that it is better to shut down one of the base stations in order to save power and increase energy efficiency .",
    "figure [ fig : association_consumption ] also shows that the total power consumption of this system decreases by about half at a price of 0.06 .    finally , we present our simulation results for a large scale system .",
    "the topology of this system is illustrated in figure [ fig : grid ] .",
    "we consider a 3000 m by 3000 m area with 9 macro base stations forming a 3 by 3 grid .",
    "in addition , there are 16 micro base stations uniformly distributed in the area @xmath159\\times[1000,3000]$ ] .",
    "we assume that there are 81 clients uniformly distributed in the area @xmath160\\times[0,3000]$ ] .",
    "clients within the area of @xmath161\\times[0,1000]$ ] have weights @xmath162 , while all other clients have weights @xmath163 .",
    "[ fig : full ] shows the performance comparison between our proposed and other mechanisms .",
    "[ fig : spectrum_efficiency ] compares the weighted total throughput , @xmath164 , and fig .",
    "[ fig : energy_efficiency ] compares the energy efficiency , defined as @xmath165(total power consumption ) , for the various mechanisms .",
    "our proposed protocol achieves better performance than all other mechanisms , especially when the price of energy is high .",
    "further , as the price of energy increases , our proposed protocol turns some base stations into sleep mode , which results in smaller weighted total throughput but improves energy efficiency .",
    "thus , our proposed protocol can achieve tradeoff between energy efficiency and spectrum efficiency by choosing suitable price of energy .",
    "in this paper , we propose a distributed protocol for self - organizing lte systems that considers both spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency .",
    "this protocol jointly optimizes several important components , including resource block scheduling , power allocation , client association , and the decisions of being in active or sleep mode .",
    "the protocol requires small computational and communicational overheads .",
    "further , simulation results show that our proposed protocol achieves much better performance than the existing policy .",
