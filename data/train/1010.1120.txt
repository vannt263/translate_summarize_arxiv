    "the heavy - ion reactions at intermediate energies have been used extensively over the last three decades to produce the hot and dense nuclear matter leading to the understanding of nuclear matter equation of state ( eos ) as well as in - medium nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) cross - section .",
    "collective transverse in - plane flow @xcite has been found to be one of the most sensitive observable in this direction .",
    "a lot of experimental as well as theoretical efforts have been made to study the transverse in - plane flow @xcite .",
    "the variation in the flow as a function of beam energy reflects the competition between the attractive and repulsive interactions @xcite . at a particular incident energy , the strength of these two interactions counter - balance each other and the net transverse in - plane flow vanishes .",
    "this energy is often referred as the energy of vanishing flow ( evf ) .",
    "krofcheck @xmath2 @xcite , for the first time , reported the vanishing of collective flow in the reaction of @xmath3+@xmath3 at around 50 mev / nucleon .",
    "later , a large number of attempts were made to study the evf over wide range of masses and impact parameters .",
    "a comparison with experimental data also threw light on the equation of state @xcite .",
    "the evf has been found to depend also on the combined mass of the system @xcite .",
    "a power law mass dependence ( @xmath4 ) has also been reported in the literature . from earlier measurements ,",
    "@xmath5 was supposed to be close to -1/3 ( resulting from the interplay between the attractive mean field and repulsive nn collisions ) @xcite whereas recent attempts suggested a deviation from the above mentioned power law @xcite .",
    "the colliding geometry also plays an important role in determining the flow as well as its disappearance @xcite . as",
    "two nuclei collide , the pressure and density increase in the interaction region . at non zero colliding geometry , due to the anisotropy in the pressure",
    ", there is a transverse flow of nuclear matter in the direction of lowest pressure .",
    "therefore , as colliding geometry increases from perfectly central collisions ( i.e. b = 0 ) , the transverse in - plane flow increases , passes through a maximum and with further increase in the impact parameter , the transverse flow decreases and passes through a zero value and achieves even negative values @xcite . for grazing collisions , it must vanish again .",
    "thus , barring the perfectly central and grazing collisions , there should exist a particular colliding geometry at a given incident energy at which the transverse flow must vanish .    in this letter , we propose a new observable , the geometry of vanishing flow ( gvf ) , which can be used to extract the information about the eos as well as about the in - medium nn cross - section . here",
    ", we shall show that the gvf depends on the combined mass of the system and follows a power law behavior @xmath4 .",
    "for the present study , we use quantum molecular dynamics ( qmd ) model . in qmd model @xcite , each nucleon",
    "is represented by a gaussian distribution whose centroid propagates with classical equations of motion : @xmath6 @xmath7 where the hamiltonian is given by : @xmath8 with total interaction potential @xmath9 here @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 represent , respectively , the skyrme , yukawa and coulomb parts of the interaction .",
    "yukawa force is known to be very important for low energy phenomena like fusion , cluster decay etc .",
    "@xcite . using the above mentioned interactions",
    ", the static part of the mean field acting on each nucleon can be written as : @xmath13 the parameters @xmath14 and @xmath15 ensure right binding energy of the colliding nuclei and @xmath16 gives freedom to choose different equations of state .",
    "the momentum dependent interactions can be incorporated from the momentum dependence of the real part of the optical potential .",
    "the final form of the momentum dependent potential ( @xmath17 ) is given as @xmath18\\rho/\\rho_{0}.\\ ] ] with @xmath19 , @xmath20 having values equal to 1.57 mev and 21.54 .      for the present study , we simulated the reactions of @xmath22 and @xmath1 at full range of colliding geometries ranging from the central to peripheral collisions in small steps of 0.15 at a fixed incident energy of 150 mev / nucleon .",
    "we used hard ( dubbed as hard ) , hard with momentum dependent interactions ( mdi)(labeled as hmd ) , and soft equation of state with mdi ( smd ) along with constant isotropic constant cross - section of 40 mb as well as cugnon parametrization of energy dependent cross - section @xcite .",
    "the superscripts to the labels represent the different nn cross - sections . to calculate the transverse in - plane flow , we use _",
    "`` directed transverse momentum @xmath23 '' _ defined as @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the rapidity and momentum of @xmath27 particle , respectively .    in fig.1",
    ", we display the @xmath23 as a function of reduced impact parameter @xmath21 ( where @xmath28 = radius of projectile + radius of target ) for different colliding masses between @xmath0 and @xmath1 at incident energy of 150 mev / nucleon .",
    "all reactions were followed till @xmath23 saturates . the saturation time is longer for heavier masses compared to lighter ones .",
    "as expected , in all cases , @xmath23 increases with increase in the @xmath21 from perfectly central collisions and reaches a maximal value . after maximal value",
    ", it decreases with further increase in the colliding geometry , passes through a zero value at some intermediate impact parameter .",
    "this colliding geometry at which @xmath23 passes through a zero value has been dubbed as geometry of vanishing flow ( gvf ) . with further increase in the @xmath21 ,",
    "@xmath23 becomes negative and attains the maximal negative value after which it again vanishes at grazing collisions .",
    "the trend is uniform through out the present mass range .",
    "the value of the gvf varies with the mass of the combined system . for lighter systems",
    ", the value of gvf is smaller compared to the heavier ones .        in fig.2 , we display gvf as a function of combined system mass . in fig .",
    "2a , we display the results of hard@xmath29 ( open diamonds ) and hmd@xmath29 ( solid diamonds ) eos .",
    "the results of fig .",
    "2b are for hmd@xmath29 and smd@xmath29 ( open triangles ) eos whereas in fig .",
    "2c , we display the results for smd@xmath29 and smd@xmath30 ( open circles ) eos . the lines are power law fit ( @xmath4 ) .      in all the cases , gvf follows a power law behavior @xmath31 , where a is the combined mass of the system .",
    "the values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are , respectively , 0.24 @xmath36 0.01 , 0.23 @xmath36 0.02 , 0.25 @xmath36 0.01 and 0.44 @xmath36 0.02 .",
    "note that the values of @xmath35 is quite different from the values of @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 which are almost same , indicating that the mass dependence of gvf is insensitive towards the different equations of state as well as towards the momentum dependent interactions .",
    "it is , however , very sensitive towards the in - medium nn cross - section .",
    "note that the average strength of @xmath37 in fermi energy is about 32 mb and with a slight change in the cross - section , the value of @xmath5 is almost doubled .",
    "therefore , the mass dependence of gvf can be used to pin down the in - medium nn cross - section .",
    "moreover , it can also be used to explore the isospin effects related to the cross - section since np cross section is about a factor of three higher than the nn or pp cross - section in the present energy range .    as reported in refs .",
    "@xcite , the variation in the strength of nucleon - nucleon cross - section by keeping the form of all cross - sections same , yields a linear variation in the collective flow . in refs .",
    "@xcite , different strengths of cross - sections ( eg . @xmath38 = 20 , 35 , 40 and 55 mb ) was used and collective flow was found to vary linearly in agreement with other calculations @xcite .    to understand the above behavior , we divide the total @xmath23 into the contribution from the mean field and binary nn collision flow . the decomposition of @xmath23 is explained at energy of vanishing flow in ref .",
    "@xcite . in fig .",
    "3 , we display the @xmath23 due to mean field ( labeled as @xmath39 and collisions ( @xmath40 ) as a function of the colliding geometry . in the present study , @xmath40 is always positive where as @xmath39 is always negative except at very small colliding geometry ( which is not relevant in context of the present study ) .",
    "the shaded areas cover the full range of mass in the present study .",
    "the values of both @xmath39 and @xmath40 are larger for heavier mass than the lighter ones i.e. upper ( lower ) boundary of each shaded area represent heavier ( lighter ) mass .",
    "the top panel is for @xmath41 and @xmath42 , bottom panel is for @xmath43 and @xmath44 and middle panel is for @xmath43 and @xmath42 . from figs .",
    "2a and 3a , we see that the range of gvf ( from lighter to heavy masses ) is around 0.5 to 0.8 and in this range , the inclusion of mdi has the same effect on gvf throughout the mass range keeping the value of @xmath5 unchanged .",
    "similar effects can also be seen for the equation of state from figs .",
    "2b and 3b . from figs . 2c and 3c",
    ", we see that flow due to the mean field is exactly the same for all the systems at all colliding geometries , whereas , the effect of binary collisions is different for different masses at and around respective gvf , thus making the mass dependence of gvf quite sensitive to the nucleon - nucleon cross - section .    in summary , we have studied the transverse flow throughout the mass range from @xmath0 to @xmath1 as a function of impact parameter .",
    "we find that at smaller impact parameters , the flow is negative while going through the impact parameter , transverse flow vanishes at a particular colliding geometry dubbed as the gvf .",
    "we find that the mass dependence of gvf is insensitive to the equation of state and momentum dependent interactions whereas it is quite sensitive to the binary nn cross - section presenting it a new probe to constraint the strength of binary cross - section .",
