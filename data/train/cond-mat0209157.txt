    "the study of small interacting spin systems is not only of theoretical interest but also of importance for the experimental investigation of recently synthetized magnetic molecules @xcite,@xcite,@xcite,@xcite .",
    "an exact calculation of the thermal expectation values of the relevant quantum observables and other quantities such as correlation functions is possible only in very few cases .",
    "given this situation , a classical treatment yields a first approximation for individual spins @xmath2 with @xmath3 which is often astonishingly good , as well as bounds for the exact quantum values ( c.  f.  berezin / lieb - inequalities ) .",
    "it is also valuable as a guide for developing approximation schemes for attacking the quantum theoretical problem .",
    "+ one of the fundamental characteristics of a system is its ground state(s ) and the corresponding ground state energy .",
    "the problem of determining the exact classical ground state has been considered for a long time , see e.  g.  @xcite,@xcite , but has only been solved for a few special systems .",
    "these include arrays of interacting spins occupying the sites of a regular @xmath4-polygon ( spin rings ) with nearest - neighbor coupling constant @xmath5 ( antiferromagnetic in our convention ) .",
    "the corresponding ground state energy is @xmath6 corresponding to an alternating configuration of spin orientations in the @xmath4-polygon .",
    "the analogous result @xmath7 does not appear to be in the literature , although it is easily established , see ( [ 21 ] ) .",
    "another class of systems where the classical ground states are easily determined are the so - called bi - partite systems , which can be divided into two subsets @xmath8 and @xmath9 such that there are only interactions ( with a positive coupling constant @xmath10 ) between spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 . in this case",
    "any anti - parallel configuration between @xmath8 and @xmath9 will minimize the energy .",
    "the regular polygons with even @xmath4 considered above and the cube are simple examples of bi - partite systems .",
    "+ recently , the exact classical ground state of a system consisting of @xmath13 spins occupying the vertices of an icosidodecahedron @xcite,@xcite has been determined @xcite .",
    "the method employed there can be applied to any system which can be decomposed into a set of triangles without common edges and which is 3-colorable .",
    "examples are the octahedron ( as mentioned in @xcite ) and the cuboctahedron ( this is obtained by joining the mid - points of the edges of a cube with their nearest neighbours , see figure [ f-5 ] ) .",
    "all these systems have coplanar ground states with @xmath1 which can be modified to remain ground states in the presence of a magnetic field @xmath14 , the corresponding energy depending quadratically on @xmath14 , c.  f.  @xcite .",
    "this yields a definite prediction for the magnetisation versus magnetic field plot at low temperatures : it should have a constant slope until a critical magnetic field @xmath15 is applied , and for @xmath16 the magnetisation is saturated . + in the present paper",
    "we will derive a further consequence for systems having coplanar ground states with @xmath1 . the same formal equation as that characterizing the ground state in the presence of a magnetic field occurs for the ground state subject to the extra constraint that the square of the total spin assumes a given value .",
    "generalizing the solution in @xcite we obtain a whole family of states assuming the minimal energy @xmath17 .",
    "it turns out that for these systems the function @xmath17 is quadratic in @xmath0 of the form @xmath18 here @xmath19 is the row sum ( @xmath20 ) of the adjacency matrix @xmath21 defined below .",
    "@xmath21 is chosen in such a way that @xmath19 does not depend on @xmath22 , and @xmath23 is the smallest eigenvalue of @xmath24 .",
    "conversely , the existence of a lower parabola ( [ 3 ] ) implies the coplanarity of the ground state , see theorem [ ct1 ] for details .",
    "analogous results hold for the maximal eigenvalue @xmath25 of systems with @xmath1 coplanar anti - ground states .",
    "hence these systems show an exact rotational band structure ( rbs ) which has been conjectured to apply for a general class of quantum spin systems @xcite .",
    "thus our findings strongly support that conjecture in the sense that the considered class of spin systems has exact rbs - parabolas in the classical limit @xmath26 . on the other hand we have found classes of systems which deviate from the exact rbs - parabolas , especially for small values of @xmath0 , see section 6 . hence our work may be viewed as a first step towards an understanding of the conditions for the occurence of rbs - parabolas .",
    "we will call systems , which exactly attain their lower rbs - parabola ( [ 3 ] ) ,  parabolic \" . for general systems",
    "the corresponding parabolas represent lower and upper bounds for the energy values , as will be proved in section 4 .",
    "sometimes these bounding parabolas will be very good approximations of the boundaries of the energy spectrum even for non - parabolic systems .",
    "+ other questions arise in connection with spin systems having coplanar @xmath1 ground states .",
    "has every classical spin system coplanar ground states or even coplanar @xmath1 ground states ?",
    "if not , what is the criterion for having coplanar ground states ?",
    "are there systems with both coplanar and non - coplanar ground states ?",
    "we do not have complete answers to these questions , but we can show the following :    * in general the spin triangle with arbitrary coupling constants @xmath27 has only coplanar ground states with @xmath28 . *",
    "a spin system which we call  pentagonal star \" has a non - coplanar ground state with @xmath28 .",
    "the existence of coplanar states with the same energy can be excluded on the basis of numerical calculations .",
    "* for certain systems the existence of coplanar , symmetric ground states can be excluded . by",
    " symmetric \" we mean roughly that the state has the same symmetry as the spin system itself ( for details see section 5 ) . *",
    "other systems , such as the dodecahedron and the icosahedron , have symmetric non - coplanar ground states and apparently no coplanar ones .",
    "these ground states can be geometrically vizualized in terms of what is known @xcite as the  great stellated dodecahedron \" and the  great icosahedron \" , respectively .",
    "* the tetrahedron has a symmetric non - coplanar ground state with @xmath1 and a variety of other non - symmetric ground states including coplanar ones , all of the same energy . *",
    "the same is true for other systems with full permutational symmetry (  @xmath4-pantahedron \" ) , except that these systems do not have symmetric ground states for @xmath29 . *",
    "the cuboctahedron has a lower rbs - parabola but interestingly it has two symmetric ground states with @xmath1 , a coplanar one and a non - coplanar one .",
    "the latter corresponds to a degenerate stellated figure which we have not found in the literature and which is composed of four stars of david , see figure [ f-6 ] .",
    "thus we are faced with a surprising variety of possibilities of ground states of different types .",
    "the main open problem is to rigorously prove the existence of spin systems without coplanar ground states .",
    "it appears that quantitative statements can be made mainly if symmetric states are concerned , since in this case we may use standard methods of group theory , in particular representation theory of the point groups .",
    "+ the article is organized as follows : section 2 contains the general definitions and results which are independent of symmetry assumptions .",
    "the main result is that systems with coplanar @xmath1 ground states have rbs - parabolas ( theorem 1 ) and its converse ( theorem 2 ) .",
    "these parabolas represent lower and upper energy bounds even for non - parabolic systems , as proven in section 4 . in section 3",
    "we address questions of extension of ground states to larger systems and  higher order frustration \" .",
    "section 5 introduces symmetry assumptions and the definition and simple properties of symmetric states .",
    "this machinery is applied in section 6 to the investigation of particular examples .",
    "we consider the general triangle which is generically non - parabolic as well as classes of symmetric spin systems including the quasi - regular polyhedra .",
    "we construct symmetric ground states from certain irreducible representations of the respective point groups .",
    "the article closes with a summary .",
    "we consider as the phase space of the classical spin system the @xmath4-fold product of the unit sphere @xmath30 .",
    "instead of using canonical coordinates we will denote a state by a sequence @xmath31 of unit vectors @xmath32 with components @xmath33 .",
    "the total spin is @xmath34 with components @xmath35 . if not indicated otherwise , the abstract letters @xmath36 will always be ( upper ) indices and there is no danger of confusion with the square of a vector , e.  g.  @xmath37 .",
    "we will use bracketed indices to denote by , say , @xmath38 the vector with the components @xmath39 , similarly for matrices .",
    "for example , the @xmath40 matrix @xmath41 consists of @xmath42 row vectors @xmath43 and of @xmath44 column vectors @xmath45 .",
    "+ if not mentioned otherwise , the hamilton function ( or  energy \" ) will be of the form @xmath46 if a magnetic field @xmath47 is to be included we add a zeeman term and obtain @xmath48 where @xmath49 contains the common combination of the spectroscopic splitting factor @xmath50 and the bohr magneton @xmath51 and is scaled with the function @xmath52 of the corresponding spin quantum number @xmath2 .",
    "note that the exchange parameters @xmath53 are not uniquely determined by the hamiltonian @xmath54 via ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "different choices of the @xmath53 leading to the same @xmath54 will be referred to as different  gauges \" .",
    "we will adopt the following gauges .",
    "first , the antisymmetric part of @xmath21 does not occur in the hamiltonian ( [ 4 ] ) .",
    "hence we will follow common practice and choose @xmath55 .",
    "thus the @xmath53 can be considered as the entries of a real symmetric matrix @xmath56 .",
    "second , since @xmath57 we may choose arbitrary diagonal elements @xmath58 without changing @xmath54 , as long as their sum vanishes , @xmath59 . the usual gauge chosen throughout the literature is @xmath60 which will be called the  zero gauge \" . in this article , however , we will choose another gauge , to be called the  homogeneous gauge \" , which is defined by the condition that the row sums @xmath61 will be independent of @xmath22 .",
    "note that the eigenvalues of @xmath21 may non  trivially depend on the gauge .",
    "we found that the eigenvalues of @xmath21 are only relevant for energy estimates if the row sum of @xmath21 is constant .",
    "this would restrict the applicability of large parts of our theory if we adopt the zero gauge .",
    "however , by introducing the homogeneous gauge we can apply our results to a very general class of systems .",
    "+ the quantity @xmath62 is gauge  independent .",
    "if exchange parameters satisfying @xmath63 are given in the zero gauge , the corresponding parameters @xmath53 in the homogeneous gauge are obtained as follows : @xmath64 @xmath65 it follows that @xmath66    a spin system is called ( af ) iff all @xmath67 for @xmath68 .",
    "a system is called iff its spin sites can not be decomposed into two disjoint classes , say @xmath69 and @xmath70 , such that @xmath71 if @xmath72 and @xmath73 . + in the special case where all exchange parameters @xmath74 are @xmath75 or @xmath10 , the system can be essentially represented by its graph @xmath76 .",

    "the vertices are the spin sites , @xmath82 , and the edges represent interacting pairs of spins . for spin systems it is appropriate to consider only graphs without loops and multiple edges , as we do in this article , following , e.  g.  , @xcite .",
    "+ there are different ways to graphically represent a spin state @xmath83 . for specific spin systems , e.  g.  magnetic molecules , the spin sites",
    "@xmath84 are embedded into the physical 3-space and represented by vectors @xmath85 .",
    "one way would be to attach the vectors @xmath83 as small arrows to the sites given by @xmath85 .",
    "this is done in figure [ f-8 ] below . however , when using this representation it is difficult to visualize the structure of the @xmath83 in spin space .",
    "hence we will mostly employ another method of representation : we draw the @xmath4 vertices in spin space according to the unit vectors @xmath83 and join them with lines according to the edges of the original spin graph @xmath76 .",
    "thus we obtain a graph isomorphic to @xmath76 which contains the additional information about the considered spin configuration .",

    "we will denote the @xmath101-th normalized eigenvector of @xmath102 by @xmath103 , i.  e.   @xmath104 and @xmath105 where we also allow for the possibility to choose complex eigenvectors .",
    "+ we note in passing that @xmath21 in the homogeneous gauge is essentially the hamilton operator of the corresponding quantum spin system , restricted to the subspace of total magnetic quantum number @xmath106 .",

    "this is completely analogous to the precession of stationary states of @xmath54 in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "+ the condition @xmath28 in ( [ 8 ] ) is necessary in order to apply the method of lagrange parameters .",
    "@xmath1 has to be excluded since it would correspond to a critical point of the constraining function @xmath128 , see for example @xcite . to cover also the case @xmath1 we consider three constraining equations written in vector form @xmath129 where @xmath130 is a fixed vector .",

    "+ indeed , this can be directly verified for the following states : let @xmath469 denote the unit vectors pointing to the vertices of the cube .",
    "the the states @xmath470 and @xmath471 have the desired properties .",
    "they are easily vizualized : @xmath472 is just the  cube in spin space \" and @xmath473 the tetrahedron where each of the four distinct spin vectors is attached to pairs of vertices of the cube connected by space diagonals .",
    "@xmath472 is the anti - ground state for @xmath1 with energy @xmath474 .",
    "since it is not coplanar , theorem 1 is not directly applicable .",
    "however , it is possible to project the cube @xmath472 onto a square and , in a second step , to enlarge the square to a square of unit vectors . since these are linear transformations , the resulting co  planar state @xmath475 is weakly symmetric and has the same energy as before , namely @xmath476 .",
    "now theorem 1 yields @xmath477 .",
    "as noted in @xcite , the octahedron can be decomposed into four triangles with disjoint edges and it is 3-colorable .",
    "hence it has coplanar ground states with @xmath1 which are obtained by extensions of the local ground states of the triangles .",
    "since @xmath478 and @xmath479 we again obtain the rbs - parabola @xmath480 the eigenspace of @xmath21 corresponding to @xmath23 is two - dimensional and carries a real , irreducible representation of @xmath296 .",
    "this corresponds to the one - dimensional complex eigenspace of @xmath21 spanned by the vector @xmath481 where the @xmath482 are the @xmath258rd roots of unity and @xmath483 denotes any @xmath258-coloring of the octahedron .",
    "it follows that the state @xmath31 is symmetrical . + the remaining @xmath258-dimensional eigenspace of @xmath21 with eigenvalue @xmath484 carries the @xmath258-dimensional self - representation of @xmath296 and hence corresponds to the symmetric anti - ground state with @xmath1 which can be vizualized as a octahedron in spin space .",
    "its energy is @xmath485 . again , as in the case of the cube , there is a weakly symmetric co  planar state with the same energy and theorem 1 yields @xmath486 .",
    "this state has the form of a ( not necessarily regular ) hexagon such that opposing vertices of the octahedron in real space are mapped onto opposing vertices of the hexagon in spin space . +",
    "the above rbs energy bounds can also be obtained more simply : since @xmath487 , where @xmath488 and @xmath489 , the minimal energy @xmath277 is obtained for @xmath490 as @xmath491 .",
    "similarly the energy is maximal for @xmath492 which yields @xmath493 .",
    "the cuboctahedron is the quasi - regular polyhedron obtained by joining the mid - points of the cube s edges with their nearest neighbors , see @xcite , @xcite , and figure [ f-5 ] .",
    "it can be decomposed into @xmath494 triangles with disjoint edges and it is 3-colorable , see figure 2 . hence there is a coplanar ground state with @xmath1 giving rise to an rbs - parabola @xmath495 since @xmath496 and @xmath497 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath498 together with their degeneracy and irreducible representations of @xmath296 are summarized in table 1 .",
    "[ table1 ]    @rll @xmath499 & degeneracy & irreducible representations of @xmath296 + @xmath500 & @xmath441 & @xmath501 + @xmath75 & @xmath258 & @xmath502 + @xmath81 & @xmath258 & @xmath503 + @xmath276 & @xmath375 & @xmath504 +    this has been calculated by using the formula connecting the characters with the multiplicity of irreducible representations , c.  f.  @xcite , 4.2.31b . from this table",
    "it is obvious that the trivial irreducible representation @xmath504 corresponds to the total anti - ground state , @xmath234 is spanned by the complex eigenvector of the coplanar ground state , and the self - representation @xmath505 corresponds to the cuboctahedron in spin space with the energy @xmath506 .",
    "it remains to identify the symmetrical states which generate the two 3-dimensional irreducible representations @xmath502 corresponding to the eigenvalues @xmath75 and @xmath500 of @xmath21 .",
    "+ the vertex vectors @xmath507 of the cuboctahedron may be represented , up to normalization , by integer @xmath258-vectors with components @xmath508 and exactly one @xmath75-component . then a state vector @xmath165 may be defined by the following rule : invert the first component of @xmath509 after @xmath75 and set the other two components to @xmath75 . here  after \" is understood cyclically , e.  g.  @xmath510 .",
    "thus we obtain a state , see figure [ f-8 ] where the spins @xmath165 of adjacent vertices are orthogonal .",
    "indeed , this state corresponds to the @xmath258-dimensional eigenstate of @xmath21 with eigenvalue @xmath75 which is transformed under @xmath296 according to @xmath502 .",
    "+    a second state @xmath511 is obtained by a permutation of the @xmath509 .",
    "each @xmath509 is mapped onto that vertex where the above - defined state vector @xmath165 points to : @xmath512 alternatively , @xmath513 is obtained from @xmath509 by the following rule : invert the first component of @xmath509 after @xmath75 and leave the other unchanged . for example , @xmath514 .",
    "also this state generates a @xmath258-dimensional subspace of the eigenspace of @xmath21 with @xmath515 which transforms under @xmath296 according to @xmath502 .",
    "geometrically , @xmath511 is a figure in spin space formed by four stars of david , see figure [ f-6 ] .",
    "thus the cuboctahedron has a coplanar ground state with @xmath1 as well as a non - coplanar one with the same energy .",
    "+      we will consider the two remaining platonic solids as well as the quasi - regular icosidodecahedron and again calculate the decomposition of the eigenspaces of the adjacency matrix @xmath21 into @xmath297-irreducible subspaces for these three cases .",
    "as in the case of @xmath296-symmetric systems , the eigenvalue @xmath96 always corresponds to the @xmath258-dimensional self - representation of @xmath297 called @xmath505 .",
    "however , we have not found coplanar states realizing @xmath96 and hence the question whether @xmath25 will be a parabola remains open .",
    "+ the situation for ground states is different from the previous examples : for the icosahedron and the dodecahedron we find symmetric ground states with @xmath1 corresponding to the @xmath258-dimensional irreducible representation @xmath502 of @xmath297 , but no coplanar ones .",
    "moreover , numerical calculations yield the results @xmath516 hence we conjecture that there are no coplanar ground states and hence , according to theorem 2 , @xmath277 will not be an exact parabola .",
    "of course , even overwhelming numerical evidence can not be considered as a rigorous proof .",
    "we can only strictly exclude symmetric coplanar ground states , since there are no two - dimensional irreducible representations of @xmath297 .",
    "this is in accordance with proposition [ p2 ] and the fact that the recently discovered @xmath1 ground states of the icosidodecahedron @xcite are coplanar and weakly symmetric , but not symmetric .",
    "+ for the two @xmath297-symmetrical platonic solids we will investigate more closely the @xmath258-dimensional geometry of the ground states . by numerical simulation of a heat bath at zero temperature , ch .",
    "schrder @xcite has found the angles between adjacent spins to be @xmath517 for the icosahedron and @xmath518 for the dodecahedron . from the knowledge of the corresponding irreducible subrepresentation of the natural representation of @xmath297 in @xmath288",
    "we can now exactly determine the symmetric ground state , see proposition [ p4 ] .",
    "it turns out that these states are well - known stellated geometrical structures , called  great icosahedron \" for the ground state of the icosahedron and  great stellated dodecahedron \" for the ground state of the dodecahedron , see @xcite and @xcite .",

    "we have tried to give a systematic survey of the properties of ( relative ) ground states of classical heisenberg spin systems with particular emphasis on symmetric systems .",
    "further we have devised various methods of ground state construction , e.  g.  extension of local ground states , construction of symmetric ground states from irreducible representations of the system s symmetry group , and the construction of relative ( anti- ) ground states from coplanar ground states with @xmath1 .",
    "the latter procedure yields upper and lower parabolas as the boundaries of the @xmath0-resolved energy spectrum .",
    "thus we have a sufficient condition for a system to be parabolic .",
    "moreover , under certain assumptions , this condition can also be proved to be necessary .",
    "+ the above issues are also relevant for the quantum theory of heisenberg spin systems .",
    "it has been shown for various cases @xcite,@xcite that the shape of the @xmath0-resolved energy spectrum of the quantum system is very well approximated by the curves @xmath277 and @xmath25 of the corresponding classical system , if only the individual spin quantum number @xmath2 exceeds some moderate value , say @xmath527 .",
    "hence one can predict semi - quantitative features of the quantum spectrum if one knows the classical spectrum and @xmath528 .    for some quantum systems , like the icosidodecahedron with @xmath529 , where the diagonalization of heisenberg hamiltonian is totally impractical , approximation methods such as the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg ) are currently able to provide estimates for the lower boundary of the eigenvalue spectrum .",
    "in fact , for the icosidodecahedron the estimates @xcite are in very good quantitative agreement with the lower boundary of the parabolic spectrum of the classical system .",
