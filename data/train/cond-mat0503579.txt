    "disaccharides have received a huge interest in the last decades for their preservation capabilities of biosystems such as cells , vaccines or therapeutic proteins employed in the food , pharmaceutical or cosmetics industry  @xcite .",
    "indeed , disaccharides such as trehalose [ @xmath0-d - glucopyranosyl-@xmath0-d - glucopyranoside ] , maltose [ 4-o-(@xmath0-d - glucopyranosyl)-@xmath1-d - glucopyranoside ] or sucrose [ @xmath1-d - fructofuranosyl-@xmath0-d - glucopyranoside ] can be added to biologically active solutions to overcome the limited stability range of proteins ( in ph , in temperature , in salt concentration , etc . ) .",
    "these additives prevent the partial or even total degradation of biomolecules due to the lethal thermal or dehydration stresses encountered during industrial conservation methods ( lyophilization ) , where trehalose has been found the most effective  @xcite .",
    "trehalose is also found in high concentration in organisms which enter into a state , called _ anhydrobiosis _ , where almost any biological activity is suspended , and thus are able to survive conditions of extremely low water content , high or low temperatures .",
    "however , the molecular mechanisms at the origin of the superior capabilities of trehalose and , more generally , of the biopreservation phenomenon itself still remain unclear , despite various experimental and theoretical works .",
    "several hypotheses have been proposed but none of them can be considered as fully accepted since they have sometimes led to contradictory conclusions .",
    "green and angell  @xcite suggested that dehydrated sugar solutions convert to a glassy state  @xcite which has been pictured as acting like amber , encaging molecules and membranes in the same way that amber traps insects .",
    "the higher glass transition temperature @xmath2 of trehalose ( @xmath3  @xcite ) could explain its greater preservation efficiency compared to maltose ( @xmath4  @xcite ) or sucrose ( @xmath5  @xcite ) or other protectants ( glucose , sorbitol , xylitol , ... )  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is now well accepted that biopreservative efficiency does not necessarily scale with the glass transition temperature , as was shown for glycerol  @xcite , trehalose - glycerol mixtures  @xcite or poly(vinylpyrrolidone ) pvp and dextran polymers  @xcite .",
    "thus , other glass properties such as fragility or anharmonicity or intimate interactions of cosolvents with biomolecules via hydrogen bonds ( hbs ) must be involved .",
    "crowe _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggested that sugar molecules were able to directly interact with the polar groups of membranes  @xcite or proteins  @xcite via hbs , by substituting to the hydration water shell , essential for proteins structure , dynamics and activity .",
    "this would preserve the three - dimensional structure of biomolecules even at low water content and is referred to as the @xmath6water replacement@xmath6 hypothesis  @xcite .",
    "trehalose would be able to replace more water molecules than other sugars and even to bind to non - polar groups of proteins owing to its higher flexibility as proposed by oku  _ et al . _",
    "the water replacement hypothesis seems reasonable for water binding sites at the protein surface and , indeed , it has been demonstrated from myriads of experiments  @xcite that trehalose can be directly h - bonded to proteins .",
    "however , it is less plausible for internal water molecules .",
    "indeed , it seems improbable that one trehalose molecule could enter into confined regions of proteins  @xcite .    moreover , timasheff _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have shown that many cosolvents are _ preferentially excluded _ from the first hydration shell of proteins , at moderate concentrations . among these osmolytes ,",
    "trehalose was found to be the most preferentially excluded  @xcite , thus inducing the greatest thermodynamic stabilization .",
    "although this mechanism might not hold at low water contents , belton and gil  @xcite , in view of raman results , proposed that the protein hydration layer is preserved , even at very high dehydration levels .",
    "these water molecules trapped in the glassy matrix formed by trehalose would allow a protein to preserve its native structure and its internal dynamics necessary to accomplish its biological function .",
    "alternatively , an approach based on the _ destructuring effect _ of sugars on the water hydrogen bond network ( hbn ) has been proposed by magaz__et al . _ _",
    "@xcite from numerous experiments such as infrared and raman spectroscopies  @xcite , nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) and ultrasound measurements  @xcite .",
    "they particularly demonstrated that trehalose promotes a more extended hydration than other disaccharides and binds more strongly to water molecules , thus preventing more efficiently the crystallization of ice , which causes lethal damages to biosystems .",
    "this hypothesis seems well suited to explain the enhanced cryoprotective efficiency of trehalose , but not its lyoprotective one .",
    "finally , cesro _ et al .",
    "_  @xcite point out the possible role of the polymorphic forms of sugars in the anhydrobiosis phenomenon .",
    "the metastable @xmath0 form of trehalose , t@xmath7 , is actually produced from the dihydrate crystal @xmath8  @xcite only below a given threshold rate of water removal above which dehydrated regions become amorphous  @xcite .",
    "depending on humidity levels , t@xmath7 may reversibly transform into @xmath8 within time - scales compatible with the anhydrobiotic protection _",
    "i.  e. _ that does not induce rapid changes in volume or internal pressure of cells .",
    "this dehydration - hydration mechanism may play a key role in anhydrobiosis because crystallization of trehalose is easier in na - cl salt aqueous solutions  @xcite and thus in cells owing to the probable presence of charged solutes or macromolecules .",
    "a considerable amount of simulation results has been accumulated on binary sugar / water solutions  @xcite or ternary protein or membrane / sugar / water systems  @xcite .",
    "most of studies of binary mixtures deal with the dilute case ( a few wt  % )  @xcite and analyze at ambient temperature ( @xmath9 300  k ) _",
    "e.g. _ sugar hydration properties - via radial and orientational distribution functions , hydration numbers , intrinsic conformations - through adiabatic maps , radius of gyration , autocorrelation functions of glycosidic dihedral angles - and sugar and water mobilities - by means of translational and rotational diffusion coefficients .",
    "investigations of concentrated mixtures are much fewer .",
    "roberts  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied 4  -  80  wt  % aqueous solutions of three homologuous monosaccharides ( namely @xmath1-d - glucose , @xmath1-d - mannose and d - fructose ) and pointed out significant effects of the sugar stereochemistry on the diffusion coefficient of water and on the structure and relaxation of the hbn in these solutions .",

    "they showed percolation of the sucrose hbn in the range of 60  -  67  wt  % at 333  k and suggested that the formation of sucrose network may increase both the mixture resistance to shear deformation and mechanical stability observed experimentally .",

    "in order to get a deeper understanding of disaccharide - water solutions structural properties in the framework of the biopreservation problem , we have carried out a careful comparative study of trehalose , maltose and sucrose in aqueous solutions by molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations .",
    "the h - bonding capabilities of these three sugars are directly comparable since they possess the same chemical formula @xmath10 and the same number of oh groups .",
    "water - water , water - sugar and both intra and inter sugar - sugar properties and their relationships have been probed in order to measure the homogeneity of the different mixtures .",
    "different relevant structural parameters have been used : partial static structure factors , two - dimensional ( 2d ) radial distribution functions , probability of hb formation , water clusters size , hydration number , molecular flexibility and sugar clusters size .",
    "the main goal of this work was to analyze the physical properties changes of the water / sugar solutions upon increasing the sugar concentration , to identify pertinent parameters aiming to explain the superior bioprotective effectiveness of trehalose and to discuss these results in the framework of the different suggested hypotheses .",

    "@xmath11-trehalose , @xmath1-maltose and sucrose disaccharides ( see fig .  [ fig0 ] ) have been investigated and are referred to in the remaining part of the paper as trehalose ( t ) , maltose ( m ) and sucrose ( s ) , respectively .",
    "disaccharide molecules have been considered flexible and have been modeled using the well - known all - atom force field designed for carbohydrates developed by ha _ et al . _",

    "electrostatic interactions have been handled by the reaction - field method using the permittivity constant @xmath12 = 72 .",
    "since a concentrated disaccharide solution has a relatively low dielectric constant , we checked the validity of the reaction - field method by performing one md simulation of the 66  wt  % sucrose solution at @xmath13 = 373 k using an ewald summation .",
    "no significant structural or dynamical difference has been found between both techniques .",
    "the compressibility of the simulated solutions was that of water ( it is a parameter of the dl_poly_2 program ) .",

    "[ fig1 ] , trehalose is found to be more hydrated than sucrose and maltose , whatever the concentration and the geometric criterion considered , in good agreement with ekdawi - sever  _ et al . _",
    "they have obtained similar results when comparing sucrose and trehalose at 353 k and 360 k , respectively , in the 6  -  90  wt  % concentration range .",
    "they particularly suggested that the intramolecular hbs were at the origin of the difference observed between both sugars .",
    "table  [ table3 ] clearly confirms this hypothesis .",
    "it is indeed well - known that maltose and sucrose form intra - hbs in their crystalline state on the contrary to trehalose  @xcite .",
    "the crystalline @xmath1-maltose forms one intra - hb between @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "two intra - hbs , namely @xmath20 and @xmath21 are present in crystalline sucrose . as a consequence ,",
    "the disaccharides hb centers ( i.e. hydroxyl hydrogen and oxygen atoms ) involved in intra - hbs no longer remain available for water - disaccharide hbs .",
    "the large number of intra - hbs of sucrose relative to trehalose and maltose for the 4  wt  % concentration explains why its hydration number is significantly lower , while those of maltose and trehalose are rather similar .",
    "moreover , a crossover between maltose and sucrose hydration curves is found at temperatures lower than 353 k , as exemplified in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] at @xmath13 = 273 k. this could arise from different concentration dependences of the relative number of intra - hbs and inter - hbs between sucrose and maltose .",
    "indeed , the difference between @xmath22/@xmath23 of maltose and sucrose steeply raises above 33  wt  % disaccharide concentration .",
    "meanwhile , the difference between @xmath24/@xmath23 of maltose and sucrose changes moderately .",
    "therefore , the overall effect is a more pronounced decrease of maltose hydration numbers compared to sucrose when increasing disaccharide concentration .",
    "hydration numbers of the 4 wt  % disaccharide solutions at @xmath13 = 293 k are given in table  [ table2 ] .",
    "trehalose clearly binds to a larger number of water molecules and consequently the water structure will be more affected by this sugar than the others as it will be shown in a next section of this paper devoted to water structure .",
    "the higher hydration number of trehalose is also seen to be independent on the choice of the model of water as proved by the additional calculations performed using the tip3p water model ( see table  [ table2 ] ) .",
    "a good agreement is particularly obtained between both spc / e and tip3p models .",
    "@xmath25 ( i ) obtained from the spc / e water model is slightly higher than with tip3p .",
    "this may be understood as the stronger water - disaccharide hbs formed with spc / e by means of the larger water partial charges .",
    "in addition , hydration numbers calculated in this study may rather be dependent on the potential energy landscape ( pel ) of sugars explored within the length of simulations . for computation time reasons , it was not possible to explore each minima of the adiabatic map of sugars .",
    "moreover , only the @xmath1-anomeric form of maltose was considered here , whereas an equilibrium between the @xmath1- and the @xmath0-form of maltose establishes in reality .",
    "several hydration numbers found in the literature from experimental and other numerical studies are also reported in table  [ table2 ] for comparison .",
    "a fair agreement is obtained with our present results and confirm that trehalose always possess the higher hydration number .",
    "discrepancies can be due to the very different definitions of the hydration number found in the literature and the various approaches and models used to derive hydration numbers from ultrasound , dsc , viscosity , or water activity measurements .",
    "nevertheless , the two geometric criteria employed in this study seem to be well suited to distinguish , within the first hydration shell , strongly h - bonded ( i ) water molecules from weakly h - bonded ( ii ) water .",

    "the greater conformational flexibility we observe for trehalose in the present study might favor these kinds of interactions compared to sucrose and maltose .",

    "@xcite and referred to the _ water replacement _ hypothesis .",
    "as the sugar content increases in the studied solutions , sugar - sugar interactions become more and more likely ( see table  [ table3 ] ) . at a given concentration threshold ,",
    "sugar clusters may even percolate , forming a continuous space - filling network .",
    "the percolation of the sugar hbn may explain the decoupling of water and sugar diffusions .",
    "indeed , it has been observed experimentally that sucrose and water diffusions decouple at water contents below @xmath9  50  wt  %  @xcite .",
    "moreover , goddard  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have suggested from simulations that the formation of sucrose network in highly concentrated solutions may increase both the resistance to shear deformation and the mechanical stability of the mixture .",
    "the formation of a sugar network should be favored by a low number of intra - hbs , since this kind of hbs involves oh groups that are not available for inter - hbs .",
    "moreover , the number of sugar - sugar inter - hbs should reveal clustering tendencies .",
    "the largest number of intermolecular sugar - sugar hbs found for maltose ( see statistics given in table  [ table3 ] ) may imply that the molecules of this sugar tend to organize themselves into larger clusters than for sucrose or trehalose . in order to describe the sugar cluster formation suggested by these hb data",
    ", we define a cluster as a set of sugar molecules connected to each other by at least one hb according to criterion ii .",
    "this geometric criterion was preferred to criterion i in order to avoid scarce clusters and consequently very poor statistics .",
    "the mean sugar cluster size @xmath86 was computed as @xmath87 , where @xmath88 is the number of sugars composing a given cluster and @xmath89 is the probability of the clusters of size @xmath88 .",
    "isolated sugar molecules are considered as clusters of size one . since",
    "sugar dynamics are much slower than water dynamics  @xcite and their number is relatively small in our simulation boxes ( between 1 and 52 ) , the statistics of cluster formation is rather poor for a given simulation .",
    "therefore , since no significant differences of @xmath90 as function of the temperature were observed , we have averaged @xmath90 over the ( 293  k-373  k ) temperature range at a given concentration ( the results at @xmath13 = 273 k have not been used because of the lack of sugar diffusion at high concentrations ) . four aberrant values over 60 were discarded ( 2 for sucrose and 1 for maltose and trehalose , among the 4 concentrations and 5 temperatures considered for these calculations ) .",
    "consequently , @xmath90 provide a rough trend of the sugar cluster formation as a function of concentration .",
    "[ fig9]a shows the evolution of the ratio @xmath91 , where @xmath23 is the total number of sugars in the simulation boxes , for the three disaccharide solutions as a function of concentration . at low concentrations ( 16 and 33 wt % ) small clusters",
    "may appear in the solutions , @xmath90/@xmath23 remaining roughly constant around 0.2  -  0.3 .",
    "therefore , the mean size of cluster @xmath90 is rather proportional to the total number of sugars @xmath23 . this behavior changes radically at higher disaccharide concentrations , where sugar clusters grow more than linearly with @xmath23 and @xmath90/@xmath23 increases to one for the solutions at 66 wt  % , which can be considered as the treshold concentration of percolation , @xmath92 .",
    "accordingly , the percolation of the sugar hbn has been achieved at this concentration _",
    "i. e. _ most of sugars of the simulation box belong to the same large cluster . notwithstanding the quite large error bars , differences below @xmath92 between maltose or trehalose on the one hand and sucrose on the other hand emerge .",
    "indeed , sucrose is found to form clusters of smaller sizes than trehalose and maltose .",
    "this is probably related to the higher number of intra - hbs of sucrose molecules compared to maltose or trehalose , since hydroxyl groups involved in these intramolecular interactions do not remain available for other intermolecular interactions ( with water or sugar molecules ) . as a consequence , a higher sucrose concentration is needed to reach a given cluster size compared to maltose or trehalose .",
    "furthermore , @xmath90 of maltose and trehalose are found relatively close to each other , consistent with their very similar topology .",
    "nevertheless , maltose molecules have a propensity to form a larger number of hbs with each other than trehalose molecules .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig9]b , which presents the normalized averaged number of intermolecular sugar - sugar hbs @xmath22/@xmath23 ( see also table  [ table3 ] ) .",
    "at low concentrations , this number is limited by the quite low probability of forming inter - sugar hbs , which prevents multiple hbs between two given sugars .",
    "it increases with sugar concentration , but is restricted at high concentrations by the maximum number of inter - hbs that sugars may form owing to sterical hindrance .",
    "the averaged number of intermolecular sugar - sugar hbs is found larger in the maltose clusters than in the trehalose ones .",
    "thus , maltose favors more sugar - sugar hbs than trehalose and sucrose .",
    "this explains in part the lower hydration number of maltose relative to trehalose at high concentrations since sugar - sugar hbs reduce the possibility that the water molecules have to bind to sugars .",
    "this peculiar interplay between the capability of a sugar to hydrogen - bond to other sugars or to water seems critical for the homogeneity of the system and could probably play a significant role in the preservation of biomolecules .",
    "indeed , it suggests that below the percolation concentration @xmath92 trehalose may form more homogeneous matrices with water with respect to sucrose or maltose .",
    "trehalose would be able to form large clusters with itself while maintaining higher hydration numbers than sucrose or maltose .",
    "moreover , since trehalose forms hbs with a larger number of water molecules than sucrose and maltose do , less _ bulk _ water molecules ( marked by a star in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) would exist in the trehalose solutions .",
    "therefore , both the ice formation probability and the dehydration stresses arising from the water escape would be reduced .",
    "however , this new insight suggests experiments to probe the influence of the sugar - water matrix nanostructure on the dehydration kinetics .",
