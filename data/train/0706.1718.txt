    "in this letter , we study the statistics of the light intensity at the central point of adaptive optics ( ao ) images in the case of a high to very high ao correction .",
    "this problem corresponds to the statistical properties of the `` instantaneous '' strehl ratio ( sr ) @xcite .",
    "the regime that we consider is relevant to current or future ao systems .    outside the central point , the statistical properties of the light intensity constrain the detection limits of faint companions to nearby stars .",
    "it can be described by a rician distribution , both in the case of a partial ao correction @xcite , and in the case of a high or very high @xcite .",
    "this model has been successfully verified in lick ao data by @xcite , and the case of coronagraphic images is detailed in @xcite .",
    "the intensity distribution at the center of ao - corrected images was previously studied by @xcite at very low correction levels , for sr in the @xmath1 regime .",
    "they showed a good agreement between the rician model , numerical simulations @xcite , and experimental data @xcite . at high to very high",
    "ao correction levels , however , the rician distribution fails to model successfully the statistics of the intensity at the central point .",
    "@xcite provided evidence of this problem in short exposure lick ao images , and we further verify this issue using numerical simulations ( sec.[srstat ] ) .",
    "@xcite modeled the observed sr distribution using the statistical properties of the atmospheric seeing . in this paper , we describe an alternative approach based solely on image formation and considering stationary phase properties .",
    "the model consists of a non - central @xmath0 distribution for the opposite of the modulus of the complex amplitude .",
    "recently , @xcite and @xcite independently developed similar approaches to modeling stationary processes , based on a model of the variance of the phase .",
    "we briefly recall the derivation of the statistical properties of ao images .",
    "a detailed presentation is given by @xcite and @xcite , based on results known in the context of holography by @xcite . in this section",
    "we use a one - dimensional formalism for clarity , but the results are valid in the general case . the complex amplitude in the focal plane is the fourier transform of the pupil plane complex amplitude : @xmath2 where @xmath3 denotes the pupil function , normalized such as @xmath4 .",
    "@xmath5 corresponds to the deterministic perfect part of the wave , and @xmath6 is the zero - mean complex error term : @xmath7 , with @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 denotes the expectation value .",
    "@xmath10 denotes the phase of the wavefront in the pupil plane , assuming a zero - mean gaussian , with a constant variance @xmath11 .",
    "we use the classical definition of sr as the ratio between the central point intensities in the actual and ideal case @xcite . using the extended marchal approximation ( @xmath12 )",
    ", @xmath5 becomes @xmath13 , which is approximately the square root of sr .",
    "_ outside the central point of the image _ , the distribution of the complex amplitude can be approximated using known results from signal processing .",
    "assuming that the complex amplitude @xmath6 can be represented by discrete values , and that the correlation between two points in the pupil plane decreases with their relative distance , the probability density function ( pdf ) of the complex amplitude in the focal plane for the random part of eq.[eq1 ] is an asymptotically circular gaussian @xcite .",
    "we recall that for a scalar circular gaussian distribution , i.e. @xmath14 , the real and imaginary parts are independent and have the same variance .",
    "we will consider that for @xmath15 , @xmath16 follows a decentered gaussian distribution @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the complex amplitude in the focal plane corresponding to the perfect part of the wave @xmath5 ( see fig.2 of @xcite ) .",
    "the corresponding intensity follows a rician distribution : @xmath19 where @xmath20 , and @xmath21 denotes the zero - order modified bessel function of the first kind .",
    "this model has been verified outside the central point of the image in simulations @xcite and in real adaptive optics data @xcite .",
    "the central point of the image is a particular case , which gives a natural estimator of the sr .",
    "we tested the rician distribution at this location with a numerical simulation , using paola @xcite to generate independent instantaneous intensity values .",
    "we chose the parameters of the ao systems to generate several sets of data with sr ranging between @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "we used a maximum likelihood ( ml ) estimation of the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 , assuming eq.[eq : rician ] .",
    "the likelihood is computed for the unbinned data and maximized using optimization routines of mathematica .",
    "the starting parameters are obtained from the moments method .",
    "we performed both the @xmath26 test and the kolomogorov - smirnov ( ks ) test on these results , using 10 identical bins for the @xmath26 test , and a monte - carlo estimation of the ks distribution , since the parameters are estimated from the data @xcite .",
    "both tests conclude that the rician model is incompatible with the data at the central point , with respective right tail values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this is confirmed by reproducing these tests for a few independent sets of simulated data .",
    "we illustrate the histogram of the simulation and the best fit obtained with the rician model in fig.[fig : riciancentralpoint ] .    this result is not surprising since the skewness of the rician distribution is @xmath29 , which is positive , whereas the data histogram clearly exhibits a negative skewness .",
    "observations based on real ao data , carried out at lick observatory @xcite and palomar observatory ( r. soummer & j.p .",
    "lloyd 2007 , in preparation ) , also reported negatively skewed sr distributions .",
    "at the center of the image , the fourier phase term of eq.[eq1 ] vanishes and the complex amplitude is simply the integral of the pupil complex amplitude , @xmath30 . at low correction levels ,",
    "the phase @xmath10 is large , and the vectors @xmath31 take any orientation in the complex plane .",
    "the sum of a large number of these vectors over the aperture produces a random walk , and the corresponding complex amplitude distribution is asymptotically gaussian , according to a central limit theorem . at high correction levels ,",
    "the phase @xmath10 is small and the vectors @xmath31 are not oriented randomly in the complex plane .",
    "their sum does not produce a random walk , and the corresponding distribution is not circular gaussian .",
    "this is the case that we study in this section . when moving outside of the center , however , the fourier phasors rotate the vectors @xmath31 in the complex plane , and the sum of the resulting vectors produces a random walk .",
    "this explains qualitatively why we obtain a circular gaussian distribution outside the central point , for @xmath32 , even at very high correction levels .",
    "fig.[figpdfcentersr90 ] shows the histogram of independent realizations of the complex amplitude , at the central point where it is clearly not circular gaussian , and in the transition region @xmath33 where the circularization occurs .",
    "this phenomenon can also be understood qualitatively by considering a taylor expansion of the phase term @xmath34 @xcite . at a very high sr ,",
    "the expansion is mainly dominated by the first oder term @xmath35 and the resulting distribution is an approximately imaginary gaussian ( see fig.[figpdfcentersr90 ] , left most panel ) .",
    "fig.[figpdfcentersr80 ] illustrates the complex amplitude histogram for a sr of about @xmath36 where the effect of higher order terms is clearly visible , when compared to the left panel of fig.[figpdfcentersr90 ] .    at a high or very high sr , we can limit the expansion of @xmath31 to the second term @xcite and we obtain the intensity : @xmath37 the second term corresponds to the mean of the phase residuals over the pupil .",
    "it seems reasonable to neglect this term compared to the first term , assuming the phase to be zero mean .",
    "given that @xmath38 , we can revert to the complex amplitude : @xmath39 by introducing a random phase term @xmath40 .",
    "note that @xmath40 is different from the pupil phase @xmath41 .",
    "the square of the phase @xmath42 is proportional to a @xmath43 distributed random variable : @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "the integral @xmath46 can be reasonably approximated by the discrete sum : @xmath47 , where the number of discrete samples can be assumed as large as necessary , and where @xmath48 with @xmath49 the uniform integration step .",
    "the variable @xmath50 , where @xmath51 denotes the degree of freedom of the @xmath26 distribution ( here corresponding to the number of discrete samples ) .",
    "the distribution of @xmath52 is a @xmath0-distribution @xmath53 @xcite : @xmath54 the opposite of the modulus of the complex amplitude @xmath55 defined as @xmath56 thus follows a three - parameter non - central gamma distribution @xmath57 .",
    "the approximation of eq.[eq : approxmod ] sets an arbitrary constraint on the mean of the distribution : @xmath58 , which corresponds to the regime of marchal s approximation @xcite .",
    "the constraint on the mean can be released without changing the statistical model by relaxing the third parameter .",
    "finally , we model @xmath59 by the @xmath60 distribution defined as : @xmath61 the mean and variance of this distribution are : @xmath62 = \\alpha \\beta + \\gamma , \\ ; { \\mathsf{var}}[\\mathcal{a } ] = \\alpha \\beta^2.\\ ] ] the skewness of the distribution is @xmath63 which is indeed negative for @xmath64 .",
    "estimations of the three parameters can be obtained by a moments method @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the classical empirical estimator of the @xmath51th centered moment .",
    "@xcite gives an algorithm for the computation of the ml estimation of @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 together with their asymptotic variance .",
    "the sr can be expressed directly using the mean and variance of the distribution ( eq.[eq : meanvar ] ) : @xmath70=\\alpha \\beta^2+(\\alpha \\beta + \\gamma)^2.\\ ] ] we obtain a new estimator of the sr by substituting the parameters in eq.[eq : sr ] with their estimated values , using the moments method or the ml . using the moments method , the estimation of the sr is : @xmath71 .",
    "fig.[figpdfmodelsr90 ] shows the results of numerical simulations for @xmath72 , including 2000 independent realizations of phase and amplitude screens , corresponding to the atmospheric corrected wavefronts and to the atmospheric scintillation . we perform a ml estimation of the three parameters @xmath67 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 , using the moments method to set the initial values",
    "the estimated sr @xmath73 from eq.[eq : sr ] matches the simulation parameters very well ( @xmath74 ) .",
    "we can derive an analytical expression for the pdf of the intensity @xmath75 , using @xmath76 from eq.[gamma ] : @xmath77 fig.[figmodels ] shows two typical pdf for the intensity , where the parameters have been estimated from simulated data , using the gamma distribution for the modulus .",
    "the rician distribution , which describes successfully the statistics of ao images outside of the central point , is not appropriate for the central point of the image _ at high correction levels_. this specific location is particularly important as it corresponds to the sr . at high sr levels , the complex amplitude at the central point",
    "is not described by a circular gaussian distribution , which can be explained by the role of fourier phasors that vanish at the central point and circularize the distribution outside the center .",
    "numerical simulations support this conclusion .",
    "we propose an alternative approach , based on a model of the modulus of the complex amplitude , well described by a non - central gamma distribution .",
    "our method enables the use of standard algorithms for the estimation of the parameters of this well known distribution . when the parameters have been estimated from the pdf of the modulus , it is possible to revert to the pdf for the intensity by the appropriate transformation .",
    "application to real data sets is under study",
    ". it would be interesting to compare the approach based on the seeing statistics @xcite or on the model of the phase variance @xcite , with our results which do not require fluctuations of the seeing .",
