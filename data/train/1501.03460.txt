    "theories of galaxy formation predict the existence of extended haloes around spiral galaxies due to gas inflow from their neighbourghood @xcite .",
    "when falling , this gas could be heated up to virial temperatures @xmath6 k , producing huge reservoirs of hot gas ( coronae ) .",
    "there are several observational manifestations of these coronae : soft diffuse x - ray emission extending up to several ten kpc from the central galaxy @xcite , absorption in o vii line @xcite , distortions in the shape of gas clouds @xcite and stripping of gas in the satellite galaxies by the ram - pressure of the halo gas @xcite , see @xcite and references therein for an extensive review .",
    "the existence of such a hot halo around the milky way is established by several different methods @xcite .",
    "extragalactic hot haloes are extremely elusive : they have been observed only in several normal galaxies without star - formation bursts @xcite",
    ". however , recently the implementation of stacking technique showed that there is a statistically significant excess in the extended x - ray signal from some normal late - type galaxies as well @xcite , suggesting that even if the haloes are individually undetectable at the present level of sensitivity , they still could be discovered by analysis of groups of objects .",
    "the milky way and other disc galaxies can also be immersed into extended cosmic rays ( crs ) haloes .",
    "this idea was thoroughly investigated in @xcite .",
    "it is well known that the milky way is not a perfect calorimeter for crs : they rather quickly , on time scales of 10 - 20 myr , escape from dense regions of the galaxy , losing only minor part of their energy in interactions with the interstellar medium @xcite . however , if strong enough magnetic fields exist far away from the central regions of the galaxy , these crs would not go directly away to the intergalactic space , but would be instead retained in the magnetized galactic halo for a considerable time .",
    "magnetic fields 10 - 100 times as weak as the galactic ones @xmath7 g ) could be sufficient to contain these crs for the cosmological time . wandering crs would interact with tenuous ( @xmath8 ) hot plasma producing gamma - rays via pionic channel .",
    "estimates show that the gamma - ray luminosity of such a halo could be around @xmath9 at energies above 100 mev @xcite . the size and shape of the halo can not be firmly established and depend crucially on the propagation properties of crs .",
    "the halo half - light radius is estimated to be 20 - 40 kpc @xcite .",
    "the contribution of the cr halo around our galaxy to the isotropic gamma - ray background can be as high as 10@xmath10 , and it is difficult to disentangle it from the truly extragalactic component .",
    "however , such haloes can be searched for around other spiral galaxies .",
    "the most natural target is the halo around the nearby m31 ( andromeda ) galaxy . with the expected angular size of several degrees and a gamma - ray luminosity of @xmath11 ,",
    "such a halo could be detected by the fermi lat even from the earth - m31 distance of @xmath12 kpc .",
    "the presence of a hot gas around m31 , which is essential for the gamma - ray emission from the cr halo , was recently demonstrated by the discovery of certain absorption features in uv - spectrum of quasars projected on the sky close to the galaxy @xcite and distortions in the observed cmb spectrum in the vicinity of m31 due to interference from the halo gas @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we describe the data and method of data analysis , section iii contains our results , and summary and discussion are in section iv .",
    "in our analysis we have used 81 months of fermi lat data collected since 2008 aug 04 ( met = 239557417 s ) until 2015 jul 06 ( met=457860004 s ) .",
    "we have selected events that belong to the `` source '' class in order to have a sufficient number of events without losing in their quality .",
    "the pass8_v2 reconstruction and v10r0p5 version of the fermi science tools was used .",
    "as the expected signal is weak and diffuse , we have selected events with energies larger than 300 mev , because at lower energies the fermi lat point spread function ( psf ) quickly deteriorates .",
    "usual event quality cut , namely that the zenith angle should be less than @xmath13 ( which is sufficient at these energies ) has been imposed .",
    "smaller psf allowed us to use smaller region of interest ( roi ) as well  we took a circle of 10 degrees around the centre of the m31 galaxy ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "the data were analysed using the binned maximum likelihood approach @xcite implemented in the _ gtlike _ utility , in which two model hypotheses were compared by their maximal likelihoods with respect to the observed photon distribution .",
    "the null hypothesis does not include the halo , the alternative hypothesis adds the halo to the list of sources of the null hypothesis .",
    "the source model includes 26 sources from the 3fgl catalogue @xcite , the latest galactic interstellar emission model gll@xmath15iem@xmath15v06@xmath15rev1.fit , and the isotropic spectral template iso@xmath15source@xmath15v06.txt .",
    "parameters of these sources were allowed to change .",
    "we also included additional 69 point - like gamma - ray emitters from the 3fgl catalogue between @xmath16 and @xmath17 from the roi center with their parameters held fixed .",
    "the m31 galaxy itself was modeled as an extended source based on the ir observations @xcite ( @xmath18 m normalized iris map ) following the prescriptions of the fermi lat collaboration @xcite .",
    "finally , extended halo spatial templates were inserted into the source model .",
    "we have used the simplest spatial models ",
    "uniformly bright circles of different radii ( from 0.1 to 5.0 degrees with 0.1 degree step ) . of course , it is not a realistic model , because some decrease in surface brightness towards the outer halo regions can be expected . on the other hand , scarcity of the data used justifies this simple approach ",
    "a more sophisticated model would inevitably involve a larger number of parameters , which would make fitting much harder and would dilute any obtained significance as well .",
    "the m31 galaxy and the halo were described by a simple power - law model : @xmath19    the normalization @xmath20 and spectral index @xmath21 were allowed to vary during the likelihood optimisation , while the energy scale @xmath22 was fixed at 1 gev .",
    "the evidence of the detection of gamma - ray signal from the halo was evaluated in terms of a likelihood ratio test statistic : @xmath23 where @xmath24 and @xmath25 are maximum likelihood values obtained from the observed data fit using null and alternative hypothesis , respectively . if the _ alternative _ hypothesis is true , then @xmath26 is approximately equivalent to the source detection significance .",
    "firstly , we have performed our analysis without additional source .",
    "the m31 galaxy was modelled in two different ways : as a point - like source or as an extended object ( the iras template ) .",
    "the extended template for the m31 galaxy fits the data considerably better than the simple point - like source ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 ) .",
    "the galaxy has a soft spectrum with photon index @xmath29 and the flux @xmath30 in the 0.3 - 100 gev energy range .",
    "the spectrum is even softer if the galaxy is modelled as a point - like source : @xmath31 with the photon flux @xmath32 .",
    "the results of fitting with additional halo component are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : graph ] .",
    "the fit quality improvement can be easily seen .",
    "the highest statistical significance @xmath33 was obtained for a halo with radius @xmath34 , corresponding to a linear size of @xmath35 kpc .",
    "the photon flux from the extended halo and the 0.3 - 100 gev luminosity obtained from the fit are @xmath36 @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively , adopting the distance @xmath39  kpc .",
    "the spectral index is found to be rather soft : @xmath40 .",
    "a marginal improvement ( @xmath41 ) could be also achieved by adding a 3-degree halo ( @xmath42 kpc ) .",
    "note that in the case of the small halo the total signal from the m31 region is dominated by the halo rather than the galaxy disc : the flux from the disc is found to be @xmath43 of the total flux @xmath44 .",
    "this fact suggests that the ir - based template can not fully trace the gamma - ray emission , and this emission is far more extended than the template size . to find how the observed gamma - ray flux from the region is shared between the two components",
    ", we have simulated events in the energy range 0.3100 gev for the relevant time span ( 71 months ) and the roi described above .",
    "the model included the galactic and isotropic backgrounds , 24 point - like sources from the 3fgl catalogue , the m31 galaxy disc ( taken in the form of the iras 100@xmath45 m template ) .",
    "spectral parameters and photon fluxes for the point - like sources were taken from the 3fgl catalogue .",
    "the recommended values were taken for the isotropic and galactic backgrounds fluxes .",
    "we have fixed the total flux from the halo and disc components to a fiducial value @xmath46 and performed simulations , gradually changing the halo contribution from 0 to 100 @xmath10 .",
    "the results are presented in fig.[fig : flux_sim ] .",
    "first of all , note that there is no leakage of the disc photons to the halo  when the fraction of the simulated halo photons is low , the results of the corresponding fit immediately show this .",
    "the same is true for the disc component as well . clearly , this method can effectively separate the two components .",
    "the actual flux from the m31 galaxy disc is low , @xmath47 , therefore its luminosity in the 0.3 - 100 gev energy range is rather modest : @xmath48 .",
    "this value is several times as small as that of the milky way @xcite .",
    "this difference could be explained by low level of the star formation rate in m31 , which is smaller than the corresponding galactic rate by a factor of 4 - 5 @xcite .",
    "the lower star formation rate not only implies less energy in the form of cosmic rays that eventually produce the observed gamma - rays , but also means that the level of turbulence in the ism of m31 is lower , which in turn leads to a rapid escape of crs from the m31 disc region .",
    "curves : an earlier version ( 65 month of data , pass7 reprocessed events and 2fgl catalogue ) is shown for comparison . the @xmath49 curve is much smoother when the latest version of event reconstruction and 3fgl source catalogue are used . ]        to exclude possible systematic and instrumental effects , which could affect our results , we have performed several additional tests :    \\(i ) in order to check whether the @xmath50 increase corresponding to the 0.9-degree halo was caused by some unidentified point - like sources , not included into the 3fglcatalogue , we have calculated the @xmath50 map using the @xmath51 utility ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : tsmap ] ) . a ts exccess at about 0.9 degree from the center of the galaxy with the galactic coordinates ( @xmath52 ) emerges that could be ascribed to fsrq b3 0045 + 013 .",
    "however , even after adding the source with these coordinates into our source model , the @xmath50 of the halo decreased only from 22 to 15 ( the @xmath50 for this source was 11.2 ) , thus the whole increase could not be attributed to this source alone .",
    "alternatively , this @xmath50 excess could be produced by an inhomogeneity in the m31 halo .",
    "the plausibility of this scenario is also confirmed by the inspection of the ts maps of several simulated haloes ",
    "they are far from being smooth and uniform , but rather consist of several random knots that could have @xmath53 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tsmap_sim ] ) .",
    "\\(ii ) we have also checked that the smallness of our roi does not considerably affect our analysis : we have performed the data analysis using a larger circle with 15@xmath54 radius .",
    "the @xmath50 values from the halo remained essentially unchanged .",
    "[ fig : template_pic ]    . ]",
    "[ fig : tsmap ]    ( 220,170 )   map with the iras template for the m31 disc .",
    "a complex extended structure around the galaxy is clearly seen .",
    "1- and 3- degree radius white circles are shown for convenience.,title=\"fig : \" ]    ( 220,150 )   map of simulated data including 0.9-degree halo with the photon flux @xmath55 .",
    "a bright spot with @xmath56 that emerged by chance is seen .",
    "there are no clear signs of any extended structure beyond the @xmath57 radius.,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "using almost 7 years of the fermi - lat data , we have performed searches for an extended gamma - ray halo at energies above 300 mev around the closest large spiral galaxy , m31 .",
    "such a gamma - ray halo could have appeared as a result of interactions of crs from the m31 galaxy with gas in its halo .",
    "we find that the fermi - lat data suggest the presence of a spatially extended gamma - ray excess around m31 .",
    "the data can be described using the simplest morphology of a uniformly bright circle .",
    "the best fit gave @xmath58 significance for a @xmath1 radius ( 12 kpc ) halo with the photon flux @xmath2 and luminosity @xmath3 in the energy range 0.3100 gev .",
    "the presence of such a halo compellingly shows that a substantial magnetic field ( @xmath59 ng ) should extend around m31 up to at least 10 kpc . this excess could indicate the presence of a compact cr halo of 10 - 15 kpc in radius , similar to the halo that is indirectly observed around the milky way .",
    "independent observational checks of such a circumgalactic magnetic fields could be done , for example , by analysis of the faraday rotation measures of background extragalactic sources ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , synchrotron emission from secondary leptonic cr component could contribute at radio - frequencies @xmath60 mhz .",
    "finally , gamma - ray signatures of dark matter particle annihilations ( or decays ) around m31 may be expected @xcite",
    ".    our results also imply a low level of the gamma - ray flux from the m31 galaxy disc  @xmath4 .",
    "the corresponding gamma - ray luminosity , @xmath5 , is several times smaller than the corresponding gamma - ray luminosity of the milky way .",
    "this difference could be explained by a lower star formation rate in m31 : there are less crs and the level of the ism turbulence is lower , which in turn leads to a shorter time of containment .    past activity of the m31 galaxy could have been responsible for the complex structure of the @xmath50 excess at several degrees scale  see the example of the fermi bubbles in the galactic center .",
    "the smbh in the center of m31 that is almost by two orders of magnitude more massive than smbh in the milky way and could have injected much more energy in the form of cosmic rays in the circumgalactic space .",
    "future observations , including at energies @xmath59 gev @xcite would certainly clarify this issue .",
