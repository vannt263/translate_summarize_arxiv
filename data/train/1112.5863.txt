    "nature harvests solar energy with a remarkably high _ quantum efficiency _ , the percentage of charge carriers created by photons .",
    "recent spectroscopic experiments  @xcite and theoretical models  @xcite , provide evidence that efficient light harvesting in nature occurs by a quantum mechanism involving sustained electronic coherence  @xcite and entanglement  @xcite between chromophores . while the chromophores are chlorophyll molecules containing large networks of conjugated carbon bonds that surround a charged magnesium ion , they have largely been represented in theoretical studies  @xcite by one - electron models that neglect the effects of electron correlation and entanglement within chromophores .",
    "two advanced methods in electronic structure , density - matrix renormalization group  @xcite and two - electron reduced - density - matrix theory  @xcite , have recently shown that networks of conjugated bonds as in acene chains  @xcite , acene sheets  @xcite , and chlorophyll are associated with polyradical character that can not be adequately described without a strongly correlated many - electron quantum model .",

    "here we employ the @xmath1-electron lipkin - meshkov - glick ( lmg ) model  @xcite used extensively in electronic structure  @xcite and quantum information  @xcite .",
    "we find that strong electron correlation , considered as a _",
    "unique variable in this model _ , dramatically enhances the efficiency of the energy transfer to the reaction center by more than 100% .    the results from the multi - electron / exciton models , which unlike one - electron / exciton models allow us to control the amount of strong electron correlation in the chromophores , are consistent with the notion that strong electron correlation is likely employed by nature to enhance its energy - transfer efficiency as much as other factors such as ( i ) environmental noise  @xcite and ( ii ) entanglement between chromophores  @xcite , which have been extensively studied in the recent literature .",
    "in the multi - electron / exciton model the correlation of electrons within a molecular subunit like a chromophore is intrinsically connected with the entanglement of electrons between molecular subunits .",

    "the results give guidelines and inspiration for the engineering of new materials if their properties can be tailored to match the parameters of the model . in combination with other recent advances , including the study of functional subsystems of the fmo complex  @xcite , this interplay of electron entanglements on different length scales may enable us to develop materials with quantum efficiencies approaching those found in natural processes from photosynthesis to bioluminescence .",

    "the second - quantized operator @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron on chromophore @xmath5 in energy level @xmath7 .",
    "the 7 parameters @xmath10 are the excitation energies of the chromophore , and the 21 parameters @xmath11 are the coupling energies between all pairs of chromophores .",

    "the purpose of the present paper is to design an extension of the one - electron ( exciton ) model that treats the electron correlation within the chromophore explicitly  both in the stationary - state solutions of the schrdinger equation and in the time - dependent ( dynamic ) solutions of the quantum liouville equation .    here",
    "we generalize this one - electron ( exciton ) representation by using the @xmath1-electron lmg model  @xcite .",

    "the selection of @xmath1 in the lmg model , therefore , depends more on the number of configurations to be mixed rather than the number of electrons within the chromophore .",

    "we choose @xmath29 to correlate the single excitations within the chromophore with the triplet excitations within the chromophore . while not shown , similar results are obtained with @xmath30 as well as with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",

    "lower values of @xmath22 give less correlation and hence , less depletion of the highest mean - field occupied orbital . this estimate is conservative because : ( i ) the acene chains of a similar length typically reveal a nearly biradical filling ( @xmath45 50% in the highest occupied orbital ) , and ( ii ) the presence of the mg ion with its @xmath46 orbitals is expected to enhance the degree of correlation .    because the coupling energies @xmath11 given in ref .",

    "the two parameters of the lmg chromophore model provide the simplest approach to studying the effect of strong electron correlation @xmath22 on the effective coupling between chromophores . the one - electron or dipole models with their coupling energies @xmath11 can mimic the efficiency from such correlation within chromophores through an empirical inflation of the one - electron @xmath63 coupling ,",

    "orbital occupations from recent 2-rdm calculations of correlation in polyaromatic hydrocarbons  @xcite suggest @xmath64 to be a conservative estimate of the correlation within the lmg models of the 7 chromophores . using this estimate with coupling energies screened to match experimental and computational data , we project a greater than 100% enhancement from the strong electron correlation relative to the theoretical limit in which electron correlation within the chromophore is absent .    correlation - enhanced energy transfer can be compared with noise - assisted transfer .",
    "theoretical models  @xcite have shown that noise from the environment ( dephasing ) can assist energy transfer in the fmo complex by interfering with the coherence ( resonance ) between chromophores with similar energies , which facilitates the downhill flow of energy to the lowest - energy , third chromophore , connected to the reaction center . electron correlation on each chromophore , we have shown , enhances transfer by opening additional coherent channels between chromophores , which also accelerates energy transfer to the third chromophore .",
    "photosynthesis can draw from both of these sources , strong electron correlation within chromophores and environmental noise , to increase the rates of energy transfer . some of the experimental energy - transfer efficiency attributed to noise in one - electron chromophores models may in fact be due to strong electron correlation .",
    "briggs and eisfeld  @xcite recently examined whether the energy - transfer efficiency from quantum entanglement might be matched by a purely classical process .",
    "they conclude that if chromophores are approximated as dipoles , then quantum and classical treatments can achieve similar efficiency .",
    "while their result might also be extendable to other dipole or one - electron approximations of the chromophores , many - electron models of the chromophores can not be represented within classical physics . neither the electron correlation , present in the lmg model of the chromophores when @xmath65 , nor the associated enhancement of energy - transfer efficiency can be mapped onto an analogous classical process .",
    "many theoretical models  @xcite have been designed to explore the energy transfer in recent light - harvesting experiments , but most of them treat each chromophore by a single electron with two possible energy states . in reality , however , the chromophores are assembled from chlorophyll molecules that contain an extensive network of conjugated carbon - carbon bonds surrounding magnesium ions , from which significant strong electron correlation , including polyradical character , has been shown to emerge  @xcite .",
    "recent experimental efforts , not yet published , provide further insights into the model developed here .",
    "light - harvesting devices with artificial acene - like chromophores are being synthesized and shown to exhibit long - lived coherence .",
    "once the details of these experiments are released , the present multi - electron model and future extensions will be useful in evaluating the role of strong electron correlation in these devices .",
    "furthermore , the present model predicts that the coupling between artificial chromophores , and hence their energy - transfer efficiency , can be enhanced by changing their electronic structure to increase their electron correlation .",
    "experimentally , this prediction can be tested through functional group substitutions or more fundamental changes in the synthetic chromophores that systematically modulate the degree of electron correlation .",
    "based on the present model , we predict that significant changes in coupling and efficiency , statistically related to the amount of electron correlation , will be observed .",
    "in this paper we have examined the effect of strong electron correlation and entanglement _ within _ chromophores through an extension of single - electron / exciton models of the chromophores to @xmath1-electron models , based on the lmg model  @xcite .",
    "we find that increasing the degree of electron correlation of each lmg - model chromophore significantly enhances the efficiency with which energy is transferred to the reaction center ( sink ) .",
    "this model - based result is consistent with the notion that nature likely uses strong electron correlation to achieve its energy - transfer efficiency . by mixing and yet controlling the interplay of electron correlation within and between subunits ,",
    "the model also has implications for the design of more energy- and information - efficient materials .",
