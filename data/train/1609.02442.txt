    "the main result of this note is theorem  [ thm : cd : lowerboundnfree ] , in which , for some values of @xmath8 , we improve the bounds on @xmath32 in the second - order term .",
    "the poset @xmath0 consists of four distinct sets @xmath1 such that @xmath2 , @xmath3 , and @xmath4 .",
    "however , @xmath5 is not necessarily a subset of @xmath6 .",

    "the poset @xmath34 consists of three elements @xmath35 such that @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "it is clear that @xmath36 because any @xmath34-free family is also @xmath0-free .    to establish the lower bound ,",
    "katona and tarjn used a constant - weight code construction due to graham and sloane  @xcite from 1980 . in the proof of theorem  [ thm :",
    "cd : lowerboundnfree ] , we obtain a lower bound that appears to be larger than the current known bound .",
    "however , whether it is an improvement depends on the behavior of some functions well - known in coding theory . in order to discuss our results",
    "we need some brief coding theory background .",
    "let @xmath37 denote the size of the largest family of @xmath38-vectors of length @xmath8 such that each vector has exactly @xmath39 ones and the hamming distance between any pair of distinct vectors is at least @xmath40 .",
    "this is the same as the size of the largest family of subsets of @xmath19 $ ] such that each subset has size exactly @xmath39 and the symmetric difference of any pair of distinct sets is at least @xmath40 .",
    "the quantity @xmath37 is important in the field of error - correcting codes .",
    "in fact , @xmath41 computes the size of a single - error - correcting code with constant weight @xmath39 .",
    "henceforth , we will use `` sec code '' as shorthand for `` single - error - correcting code . ''",
    "this is potentially an improvement when @xmath8 is even .",
    "we note that the same 3-level construction works for @xmath8 odd and @xmath48 .",
    "this gives a family of size @xmath49 nontrivially in three layers .",
    "however , since @xmath50 in the odd case , this does not provide an improvement to the known bounds .",
    "we believe that , for @xmath51 , the quantity @xmath41 is strictly unimodal as a function of @xmath39 as long as @xmath52 .",
    "this strict unimodality has been established  @xcite for @xmath53 and known bounds suggest that it is the case for larger values of @xmath8 as well .",
    "if unimodality holds , then @xmath41 would achieve its maximum uniquely at @xmath12 or @xmath54 .",
    "therefore , we expect ( [ eq : secondbound ] ) to also be a strict improvement over theorem  [ thm : cd : lowerboundkt ] in the case where @xmath8 is even .",
    "however , to our knowledge , the unimodality of @xmath41 has never been established and seems to be a highly nontrivial problem .            * _ ( [ it : cucdcodes ] ) .",
    "_ * let @xmath65 .",
    "then @xmath66 since @xmath67 and their symmetric difference must be at least @xmath68 in order for @xmath55 to be a @xmath69-ec code .",
    "thus , @xmath59 is a sec code . by a similar argument",
    ", @xmath60 is a sec code .    * _ ( [ it : cdnotincu ] ) . _ * let @xmath62 , @xmath63 , and @xmath70 .",
    "then , @xmath71 .",
    "so , @xmath72 . this implies that there are two members of @xmath19 $ ] that are in @xmath73 .",
    "one is @xmath74 and the other is some @xmath75 , which contradicts the assumption that @xmath76 .",
    "this concludes the proof of claim  [ cl : cd : cupcdown ] .",
    "we know that @xmath79 because it has to have elements below it and the elements of @xmath60 are all minimal in @xmath80 .",
    "we know that @xmath81\\choose k}$ ] because that would force @xmath82 and , being subsets of @xmath78 would require @xmath83 , a contradiction to @xmath60 being a sec code . therefore , @xmath84 .",
    "now , where is @xmath85 ?",
    "we know that @xmath86 because @xmath3 .",
    "we know @xmath87\\choose k}$ ] because that would force @xmath88 and thus would force @xmath89 , this is a contradiction to the fact that @xmath59 is a sec code .",
    "therefore , @xmath90 .    in order for the copy of @xmath0 to exist , @xmath3 , which implies @xmath91 and so @xmath92 .",
