    "study the problem of scheduling electrical appliance energy consumption in residential smart grid .",
    "our goal in revisiting this well - known problem of energy consumption scheduling ( e.g. , @xcite ) is to establish a new formulation of optimal scheduling problems where we take into account the _ atomicity _ of operations by household appliances , and to provide efficient solution techniques for the formulated optimal scheduling problems . by atomicity ,",
    "we mean the _ unsplittable _ nature of appliances operations and resulting energy consumption .",
    "note that the scheduling of electrical appliance energy consumption is a key to the autonomous demand - side management ( dsm ) for residential smart grid in optimizing energy production and consumption ; the scheduling is based on smart meters installed at users premises and the two - way digital communications between a utility company and users through the smart meters , and the typical goals of dsm includes consumption reducing and shifting , which lead into lower peak - to average ratio ( par ) and energy cost @xcite .",
    "since the energy consumption scheduling was formulated as an optimization problem using energy consumption scheduling vectors as optimization variables representing appliances scheduled hourly energy consumption over a day @xcite , there have been published a number of papers on the subjects of appliance energy consumption scheduling and related billing / pricing mechanisms based on this formulation .",
    "for instance , the issue of optimality and fairness in autonomous dsm is studied in relation with billing mechanisms in @xcite , while the same issue is studied but in the context of user privacy in @xcite .",
    "the cost and par minimization problems , which are separately formulated in @xcite , are integrated into a par - constrained cost minimization problem in @xcite .",
    "this integration is also further extended to take into account consumers preference on operation delay and power gap using multiple objective functions . in @xcite , instead of typical concave @xmath0-person games , rubinstein - stahl bargaining game model is used to capture the interaction between the supplier and the consumers through a retail price vector in lowering par to a certain desired value .    in most existing works on the energy consumption scheduling for autonomous dsm in smart grid ,",
    "however , no serious attention has been given to the microstructure of scheduled energy consumption over time slots ; their major focus is on the optimal value of an objective function that is only based on the aggregate load from the scheduled energy consumption .",
    "few exceptions in this regard include the works on the integration of consumers preference @xcite and the use of load consumption curves in the objective function @xcite .    below are some scenarios illustrating the importance of the atomicity of appliance operations .",
    "* when a user washes clothes , the washing machine should be continuously on for a certain period depending on the amount of laundry , e.g. , for two hours , during which the operation of the clothes washer can not be interrupted and the supplied power can not be reduced arbitrarily . as the washing task can be activated anytime within a specified period , e.g. , from 9 am to 3 pm when the user is out to work , the major goal of autonomous dsm is to determine the optimal two - hour time slot to complete the task when the energy price is lowest during the specified period .",
    "* for heavier - duty tasks like charging the battery of a plug - in hybrid electric vehicle ( phev ) , again the continuity of the operation is important , e.g. , four hours of uninterruptible charging to maintain the lifetime of phev s battery .",
    "* appliances such as a rice cooker can significantly contribute to the overall cost saving if handled properly .",
    "some rice cookers function may take more than one hour for completion , e.g. , the slow cooking function for delicate soup , whereby the cooking process can be scheduled within any time - shot during the day .",
    "considering that most of the operations subject to dsm are either atomic as such ( e.g. , laundry cleaning by a clothes washer ) or consist of atomic suboperations ( e.g. , house heating by a heater operating in the morning and in the evening ) @xcite , therefore , we provide a new formulation of the optimization problem for atomic scheduling of appliance energy consumption and efficient solution techniques for resulting problems in this paper .",
    "atomic scheduling has been mostly discussed in the context of concurrent task scheduling on a multi - processor / core system on a chip ( soc ) ( e.g. , @xcite ) or transaction processing ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to the best of our knowledge , our work is the first attempt to formulate atomic scheduling of appliance energy consumption in the autonomous dsm for residential smart grid .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows : in section  [ sec : curr - form - appl ] , we review and discuss the issues of the current formulation of appliance energy consumption scheduling based on energy consumption scheduling vectors defined over time slots . in section  [ sec : atom - sched - appl ] , we describe a new formulation of the appliance energy consumption scheduling based on the optimal routing framework , which guarantees the atomicity of appliance operations , and a successive convex relaxation technique for the efficient solution of the boolean - convex problem resulting from the new formulation for a given convex objective function . in section  [ sec : numerical_results ] , we demonstrate that the performance of successive convex relaxation technique through numerical results for the cost and par minimization problems .",
    "section  [ sec : conclusions ] concludes our work and discusses topics for further study .",
    "we first review the current formulation of appliance energy consumption scheduling problem by formally describing it .",
    "the formulation described here is largely based on @xcite but with some modifications and extensions for clarity and better handling of scheduling intervals over a day boundary .",
    "many notations and definitions in this section are applicable to the formulation of atomic scheduling problems in section  [ sec : atom - sched - appl ] as well .",
    "let @xmath1 denotes a set of users in a residential smart grid , whose appliances share a common energy source and subject to autonomous dsm .",
    "without loss of generality and for ease of presentation , we assume that each user has only one appliance throughout the paper . in this case",

    "is given by @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the minimum and the maximum energy levels for a time slot , @xmath8 is the total daily energy consumption of user @xmath0 s appliance , and @xmath9 is a _ scheduling interval _ defined as follows @xmath10\\right\\}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 $ ] , @xmath12 $ ] , and @xmath13 .    with these definitions of scheduling vectors and feasible sets , the optimal scheduling is formulated as an optimization problem for a given objective function ( e.g. , total energy cost or par ) as follows : @xmath14 where @xmath15 .\\ ] ]    as shown in @xcite , it is better to develop a dsm approach that optimizes the properties of the aggregate load of the users rather than individual user s consumption .",
    "in fact , the optimal scheduling problems are formulated in terms of the total load across all users at each time slot @xmath16 in @xcite , i.e. , @xmath17 so can be expressed as @xmath18 where @xmath19.\\ ] ] note that the objective function becomes @xmath20 for the energy cost minimization problem , where @xmath21 is a cost function indicating the cost of generating or distributing electricity energy by the energy source at a time slot @xmath16 , and @xmath22 for the par minimization problem , respectively .",
    "a major issue with the formulation of optimal scheduling problems based on the energy consumption scheduling vectors in is that it can not guarantee the atomicity of appliance operations , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : non - atomic_vs_atomic ]  ( a ) .",
    "when a load from other appliances falls on the middle of the scheduling interval , especially that of non - shiftable appliances , the scheduled appliance energy consumption spreads over non - contiguous time slots , resulting in several gaps .",
    "relatedly , the scheduled energy consumption may not provide enough power for appliances to carry out required operations because , during the scheduling , the energy levels over time slots are determined to achieve the optimal solution for the given objective function but not to meet the actual energy consumption requirements of the appliances for the operations .",
    "the atomic scheduling that will be described in section  [ sec : atom - sched - appl ] , on the other hand , assigns contiguous time slots with a predefined pattern of operating energy levels ( i.e. , @xmath23 ) as shown in fig .",

    ".    , @xmath7 , and @xmath23 are the minimum , the maximum , and the operating energy levels of an appliance for a time slot . ]",
    "we assume that all appliance operations are atomic ( i.e. , no gaps in energy consumption during the operations ) and that the operation of the appliance of user @xmath0 requires @xmath24 contiguous time slots belonging to a scheduling interval of @xmath9 with a predefined pattern of operating energy levels ) , the energy level becomes a power level .",
    "] @xmath25 such that @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 otherwise . clearly , @xmath28 . without loss of generality , we set @xmath6 to 0 ; the resulting daily energy consumption @xmath8 , therefore , is given by @xmath29 fig .",
    "[ fig : op_energy_level_example ] shows an example of operating energy levels .    .",
    "]    note that , if an appliance requires multiple , separate scheduling intervals ( e.g. , one for 6 am11 am and the other for 1 pm5 pm ) , it can be modeled as multiple ( virtual ) appliances , each of them having only one contiguous scheduling interval ( i.e. , appliance 1 with 6 am11 am and appliance 2 with 1 pm5 pm ) .",
    "a simple and straightforward formulation of atomic scheduling is using the starting times of operations as optimization variables , i.e. , @xmath30\\ ] ] where a feasible set of starting times for user @xmath0 is given by @xmath31\\right\\}\\ ] ] the total load across all users at each time slot @xmath16 , therefore , can be expressed in terms of starting times @xmath32 , as follows @xmath33 where @xmath34 is a range of user @xmath0 s appliance operation for @xmath35 defined by @xmath36\\right\\}\\ ] ] and @xmath37 is an indicator function ; note that , for a set @xmath38 , the indicator function is defined as @xmath39    because the feasible set is now discrete , we have to evaluate the objective function for all the elements in the feasible set , which makes the optimization problem impractical for large @xmath40 and @xmath41 . for instance , when @xmath42 and @xmath43 with the worst case scenario of @xmath44 , @xmath45 , and @xmath46 for all @xmath47 , global optimization by direct enumeration would require evaluating the objective function @xmath48 times , which is on the order of @xmath49 times . to address the scalability issue ,",
    "therefore , we provide an alternative formulation of atomic scheduling based on the optimal routing framework , which is amenable to convex relaxation and enables systematic analysis of suboptimal solutions with upper and lower bounds .",
    "we provide a new formulation of the optimal scheduling of appliance energy consumption based on the framework of _ optimal routing _ in networking ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  5 ) ; this new formulation takes into account the atomicity of appliance operations in scheduling without taking any additional objective functions .",
    "as for optimization variables , instead of the energy consumption scheduling vector @xmath50 in , we use _ flow configurations of users over multiple paths _ between the common source and destination nodes of the network shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : atomic_scheduling ]  ( a ) , @xmath52 is a three - hop path consisting of links @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 on the ring .",
    "note that we do not take into account the radial links connecting the source and the destination nodes to and from the intermediate nodes on the ring in calculating hop counts and path / link costs .",
    "we now define @xmath64 as a flow that user @xmath0 sends on path @xmath65 , which represents an atomic operation of user @xmath0 s appliance with starting time slot @xmath66 and duration of @xmath24 slots .",
    "[ fig : atomic_scheduling ]  ( b ) shows mapping of all possible atomic appliance operations of two users ( i.e. , @xmath67 , @xmath68 , @xmath69 for user 1 and @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 for user 2 ) into corresponding groups of flows ( i.e. , @xmath73 for user 1 and @xmath74 for user 2 ) .",
    "we use the flow configurations of all users as the optimization variables , which are defined as follows : @xmath75\\ ] ] where @xmath76 .\\ ] ] a feasible atomic energy consumption scheduling set for user @xmath0 is given by @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the feasible set of starting times for user @xmath0 that is already defined in but in terms of @xmath66 instead of @xmath35 .",
    "note that the constraint of @xmath79 in ensures that an optimal user flow configuration vector @xmath80 has only one non - zero element representing the starting time of a scheduled atomic operation .    with the user flow configurations , the total load across all users at each time slot @xmath81 can be calculated as the sum of all flows passing over the link @xmath82 , i.e. , @xmath83 now that we have an expression of the total load at each time slot in terms of flows representing atomic operations of appliances , we can formulate the problem of optimal scheduling of appliance energy consumption for a given objective function of @xmath84 with @xmath85 $ ] as follows : @xmath86    for a convex objective function",
    ", this problem becomes a _",
    "boolean - convex _ problem , since the sum constraint in is linear and the optimization variable @xmath87 is restricted to take only 0 or 1 as in @xcite .",
    "note that this problem still can not be solved efficiently but , unlike the problem formulation directly based on starting times in , is amenable to the successive convex relaxation technique that we describe in section  [ sec : successive_convex_relaxation ] .",
    "we can obtain the _ convex relaxation _ of the atomic optimal scheduling problem in by replacing the nonconvex constraints @xmath88 in with the convex constraints @xmath89 as follows : @xmath90 where @xmath91    for a convex objective function , this problem becomes convex because the new feasibility set @xmath92 is now convex where all the equality and inequality constraints on @xmath93 are linear .",
    "this convex - relaxed problem in , therefore , can be solved efficiently , for instance , using the well - known interior - point method @xcite .",
    "let @xmath94 denote a solution to the relaxed problem in .",
    "the relaxed atomic scheduling problem in is not equivalent to the original problem in because the elements of the optimal solution @xmath94 can take fractional values ( e.g. , 0.75 ) .",
    "the optimal objective value of the relaxed atomic scheduling problem in , however , provides a lower bound on the optimal objective value of the original problem in ; the optimal value of the relaxed problem is less than or equal to that of the original problem because the feasible set for the relaxed problem contains the feasible set for the original problem .",
    "we can also use the solution of the relaxed problem in to generate a suboptimal solution .",
    "note that we can not simply choose @xmath40 largest elements of the optimization vector as is done for the optimal selection of sensor measurements in @xcite ; because the optimization variable @xmath93 is a vector of vectors ( i.e. , @xmath80 ) , the selection of largest elements should be done per component vector .",
    "also , we found that the convex relaxation spreads the starting times of appliance energy consumption over the same scheduling interval when there are several appliances with identical parameter values ( i.e. , @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath24 ) , which often results in many elements with the same values in the component vectors .",
    "if we choose randomly one element among the same - valued ones to break ties in this case , the performance of resulting suboptimal solution is not close to the optimal one .    therefore , here we present a new technique , called _ successive convex relaxation _",
    ", where we iteratively drop fractional - valued elements and apply convex relaxation to the resulting problem until we find a feasible solution .",
    "this technique is similar to the cutting - plane algorithm in mixed integer linear programming ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  9 ) in that , at each iterative step , new constraints are added to refine the feasible region .",
    "the proposed technique , however , is much simpler in forming new constraints where it does not introduce any new slack variables and takes into account the structure of the optimization variables .",
    "the detailed procedure is described in algorithm  [ alg : successive_convex_relaxation ] , where we introduce two variables , i.e. , @xmath98 , the threshold value for dropping , and @xmath99 , the maximum number of fractional - valued elements that can be dropped per iteration . note that the overall complexity of the interior - point method to solve the relaxed convex optimization problem is @xmath100 operations @xcite , which is needed per iteration and a dominating factor of the complexity of the proposed successive convex relaxation technique . with these variables , therefore , we can do a fine control of the number of fractional - valued elements dropped per iteration and the number of iterations to finish the procedure : a reasonable value of @xmath98 ( e.g. , 0.1 ) can prevent many high fractional - valued elements ( e.g. , @xmath101 ) from being dropped unnecessarily per iteration when @xmath99 is set to a rather large number .",
    "on the other hand , when a relaxed convex optimization problem gives a solution with a large number of fractional - valued elements smaller than @xmath98 , we can drop them up to @xmath99 . in this way we can speed up the whole procedure while not sacrificing the quality of the resulting suboptimal solution .",
    "@xmath102      below we provide specific examples of the optimal atomic scheduling for frequently used objective functions for dsm in residential smart grid .      for energy cost minimization",
    ", we can formulate it as the following optimization problem similar to @xcite : @xmath103 where @xmath21 is a cost function indicating the cost of generating or distributing electricity energy by the energy source at a time slot @xmath16 .    replacing the feasible set @xmath104 with @xmath92 in",

    "as mentioned in @xcite , however , this optimization problem can be turned into a boolean - linear program , a special case of boolean - convex optimization , by introducing a new auxiliary variable @xmath109 as follows : @xmath110    again , replacing the feasible set @xmath104 with @xmath92 in , we obtain the relaxed par minimization problem , i.e. , @xmath111 like the convex optimization , the linear program can be efficiently solved by either the simplex method or the interior - point method @xcite .",
    "note that , when applying the successive convex relaxation technique described in algorithm  [ alg : successive_convex_relaxation ] , the auxiliary variable @xmath109 is not subject to dropping unlike @xmath93 .",

    "<S> the current formulation of the optimal scheduling of appliance energy consumption uses as optimization variables the vectors of appliances scheduled energy consumption over equally - divided time slots of a day , which does not take into account the _ atomicity _ of appliances operations ( i.e. , the unsplittable nature of appliances operations and resulting energy consumption ) . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we provide a new formulation of atomic scheduling of energy consumption based on the _ optimal routing _ </S>",
    "<S> framework ; the flow configurations of users over multiple paths between the common source and destination nodes of a ring network are used as optimization variables , which indicate the starting times of scheduled energy consumption , and optimal scheduling problems are now formulated in terms of the user flow configurations . because the atomic optimal scheduling results in a _ boolean - convex _ problem for a convex objective function </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a _ successive convex relaxation _ </S>",
    "<S> technique for efficient calculation of an approximate solution , where we iteratively drop fractional - valued elements and apply convex relaxation to the resulting problem until we find a feasible suboptimal solution . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for the cost and peak - to - average ratio minimization problems demonstrate that the successive convex relaxation technique can provide solutions close to , often identical to , global optimal solutions .    </S>",
