    "understanding the nature and mechanisms of the qcd phase transition has recently become one of the great issues of non - perturbative qcd studies .",
    "questions such as _ `` how can one characterize the high temperature plasma phase ? '' _ , or _",
    "`` what are the field excitations that drive the transition ? ''",
    "_ , are still far from having a generally accepted answer .",
    "a powerful approach to analyzing such questions is the formulation of qcd on a euclidean space time lattice . in this",
    "setting monte carlo simulations allow one to obtain non - perturbative results from an ab - initio calculation .    in the euclidean formulation one dimension , the euclidean time , is compactified , turning the base manifold into a ( hyper ) cylinder .",
    "the circumference of the cylinder is the inverse temperature . thus increasing the temperature means shrinking the temporal extent of the lattice .",
    "if the temperature is sufficiently high , the temporal extent is shorter than the relevant scale @xmath9 , and correlations around the compact time direction change the physics .",
    "the onset of such a strong self - correlation around time corresponds to the critical transition temperature @xmath10 .",
    "this qualitative insight about the relation of the scale @xmath9 and the time extent given by the inverse temperature can be tested on the lattice .",
    "a powerful approach to such an analysis is the use of the temporal boundary conditions as a tool . instead of using the canonical choice  periodic boundary conditions for the gauge fields and anti - periodic boundary conditions for the fermions  one may implement more general temporal boundary conditions to probe the system . according to the qualitative picture outlined above ,",
    "one is inclined to expect that below @xmath10 the system remains relatively unchanged under varying boundary conditions , while above @xmath10 the response of the system to a change of the boundary conditions should be strong .    in a series of papers the strategy of probing finite temperature qcd with the help of boundary conditions has been explored in quenched calculations . in particular generalized fermion boundary conditions",
    "have been considered .",
    "various spectral quantities of the dirac operator were studied @xcite .",
    "a new observable was proposed and studied @xcite , the dual chiral condensate , which probes the dependence on the boundary conditions and provides a link between the polyakov loop and the conventional chiral condensate .",
    "the analysis was also extended beyond the gauge group su(3 ) .",
    "quenched studies for the center - trivial group g@xmath11 @xcite and for su(2 ) gauge theory with adjoint fermions @xcite were conducted .",
    "in all these quenched studies it was established , that below @xmath10 the dirac spectrum is insensitive to the temporal fermion boundary conditions . above",
    "the deconfinement transition , which in the quenched case is characterized by the emergence of a non - vanishing expectation value of the polyakov loop , a non - trivial response to changing temporal boundary conditions sets in for fermionic quantities such as the chiral condensate and the spectral gap .",
    "it was furthermore observed @xcite that only the relative phase between the phase of the polyakov loop and the phase in the fermionic boundary condition is relevant for the physics .",
    "this even holds for the center - trivial group g@xmath11 , which behaves similar to su(n ) when one restricts the high temperature ensembles to the center sector characterized by a real polyakov loop .",
    "interesting is also the case of su(2 ) ( more generally su(n ) ) with adjoint fermions @xcite , a theory where the deconfinement and chiral symmetry restoration temperatures do not coincide , the latter being considerably higher than the former . in agreement with the picture outlined above , at the deconfinement temperature",
    "the spectrum becomes sensitive to the boundary conditions .",
    "the intermediate phase between the deconfinement and chiral restoration temperatures is characterized by a non - vanishing density of eigenvalues near the origin , and thus , due to the banks - casher relation @xcite by a non - vanishing chiral condensate , which , however , varies in size with the boundary condition . only above the chiral restoration temperature the condensate vanishes completely for the physical anti - periodic fermion boundary conditions .    in the first part of this contribution , in section 2 , we discuss the physical situation for the interplay of boundary conditions and spectral observables for the quenched case . in the second part , in section 3 , we present first preliminary results for lattice qcd with dynamical fermions .",
    "in particular we analyze publicly available dynamical su(3 ) configurations generated for two flavors of staggered sea quarks by the milc collaboration @xcite .",
    "ensembles below and above the qcd transition are studied with the staggered dirac operator and we compare the response of various spectral quantities below and above @xmath10 to changing boundary conditions . in section 4",
    "we summarize our results and give an outlook .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , the interplay of fermionic boundary conditions and the spectral quantities of the dirac operator below and above @xmath10 so far was analyzed only for the quenched case .",
    "although by neglecting the dynamical quark effects the quenched case certainly does not reflect the full problem , as a toy model it has one important conceptual advantage : it represents the passive response of the ( fermionic ) observables for a sudden ( smooth for su(2 ) ) transition of the gluonic environment . for su(n ) , n @xmath12 , there is a first order transition between the two phases and one can expect to find a distinctly different behavior of the dirac operator below and above @xmath10 .",
    "the fully dynamical theory , on the other hand , shows only a crossover , thus leading to a gradual variation of the properties rather than a sharp change .",
    "for that reason the quenched case is an interesting model laboratory .",
    "the calculations were done on su(3 ) gauge ensembles with 100 configurations each , generated with the lscher weisz gauge action @xcite with tadpole improvement . when we quote results in physical units , these were obtained from a determination of the scale @xcite using the sommer parameter .",
    "our fermionic observables were computed for the staggered dirac operator ( we here set the lattice spacing to @xmath13 ) @xmath14 \\ ; , \\label{diracop}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the staggered sign function @xmath16 . for the massless staggered lattice dirac operator ( [ diracop ] ) we evaluate complete eigenvalue spectra using a parallel implementation of standard linear algebra routines .",
    "the staggered dirac operator is anti - hermitian and consequently the eigenvalues @xmath17 are purely imaginary . the eigenvalues for the dirac operator with mass @xmath18 are then given by @xmath19 . from the complete eigenvalue spectra",
    "all our fermionic observables may be computed .",
    "as outlined in the introduction , we probe the system by changing the temporal fermionic boundary conditions .",
    "these are introduced as , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the number of lattice points in the compact time direction and the `` boundary angle '' @xmath22 $ ] parameterizes the boundary conditions .",
    "bilinear combinations ( which are bosons ) are periodic .",
    "a value of @xmath23 corresponds to the usual anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "other values are adopted to analyze the system .",
    "in particular we consider a total of eight ( for some tests also 16 up to 128 ) equally spaced intermediate values of @xmath24 in the interval @xmath25 $ ] . for completeness",
    "we stress , that all other boundary conditions , i.e. , the spatial fermionic boundary conditions and the boundary conditions for the gauge fields , were kept periodic .",
    "we work with various lattice sizes ranging from @xmath26 to @xmath27 , with typically 100 configurations per ensemble .",

    "we find also for the spectral gap that up to @xmath36 mev the two cases give roughly the same results , while above @xmath10 we observe a non - trivial response to a change of the boundary conditions .",
    "for the anti - periodic boundary conditions , we find that above @xmath10 the spectral gap opens up quickly in accordance with the vanishing condensate for that case demonstrated in the lhs.plot of fig .",

    "there is a slight upward trend , but way less pronounced than for the anti - periodic boundary conditions .",
    "this upward trend for the periodic case also becomes weaker as the spatial volume is increased and thus is probably a finite size effect , similar to the `` microscopic gap '' @xmath39 known from random matrix theory @xcite .",
    "although the picture for the spectral gap seems rather clear , there is an interesting alternative scenario to be considered : the vanishing spectral density at the origin , @xmath33 , which according to the banks - casher formula ( [ bacarel ] ) is necessary for a vanishing chiral condensate , does not necessarily imply a spectral gap .",
    "an alternative would be a spectral density that is non - vanishing for all non - zero eigenvalues but continuously goes to zero at the origin .",
    "this would imply that the spectral gap of the lattice dirac operator , shown in the lhs .",
    "plot of fig .",
    "[ fig : gap_quench ] , closes as the spatial volume is sent to infinity .",
    "the currently available data do not allow one to decide between a closing gap at infinite spatial volume or a finite limit for the gap @xcite .    in this context",
    "we also stress that the staggered lattice dirac operator is numerically cheap , but certainly not the first choice for analyzing the chiral condensate and the spectral gap .",
    "the reason is that the staggered dirac operator does not discriminate between low lying eigenvalues and eigenvalues that correspond to zero modes originating from topological excitations .",
    "the latter , however , should be removed in both the determination of the spectral gap , as well as for the evaluation of the spectral density @xmath33 .",
    "using , e.g. , the overlap operator would allow for a cleaner study  at a considerably higher computational cost , however .",
    "we have seen that above @xmath10 the spectral gap and the chiral condensate , which in turn through ( [ bacarel ] ) is related to the spectral density @xmath33 at the origin , are sensitive to the fermionic boundary conditions .",
    "both the spectral gap and the density @xmath33 are infrared properties of the dirac spectrum .",
    "an interesting question is how the other parts of the dirac spectrum respond to changing boundary conditions .",
    "this question was analyzed numerically in @xcite and analytically in @xcite .",
    "it was found that the ir modes of the dirac spectrum are most sensitive to a change of the boundary conditions , while the shift of the eigenvalues under a variation of the boundary angle @xmath24 decreases exponentially as one moves towards the uv end of the spectrum .     the expectation value of the shift variable @xmath40 as a function of @xmath41 ( both in lattice units ) .",
    "the data are for the quenched @xmath42 lattices and we compare two ensembles below ( @xmath43 mev ) and above @xmath10 ( @xmath44 mev).,width=302 ]    in order to quantify this shift , in fig .",
    "[ fig : evalshift_quench ] we show the shift @xmath40 of the eigenvalues when comparing boundary conditions with @xmath45 and boundary conditions with boundary angle @xmath23 .",
    "more explicitly , the shift variable @xmath40 is defined as @xmath46 in fig .",
    "[ fig : evalshift_quench ] we plot this shift observable as a function of the size of the physical ( @xmath23 ) eigenvalue ( both quantities in lattice units ) , and compare the results below and above @xmath10 .",
    "it is obvious that in both cases a noticeable shift is seen only for the ir part of the spectrum , and @xmath40 decreases quickly towards the uv end of the spectrum .",
    "the plot also again confirms that only above @xmath10 there is a sizable shift of the eigenvalues when changing the boundary conditions .",
    "let us finally comment on the drop of the shift variable at @xmath47 : we attribute this effect to the would - be zero modes of the staggered dirac operator .",
    "for a chiral operator such as the overlap operator , they would be frozen at the origin when changing the boundary conditions .",
    "the staggered operator does not protect them from a shift , but the nature of the would - be zero modes is at least manifest in a drop of the shift variable @xmath40 at @xmath47 .",

    "above @xmath10 they show a sine - like behavior as a function of @xmath24 . for the sector where the polyakov loop is essentially real ( center plot ) , the lowest eigenvalues come close to zero for the case of periodic boundary conditions ( @xmath48 ) . for the case of configurations in a sector with complex polyakov loop ( bottom plot ) ,",

    "it signals the breaking of the center symmetry , which for the quenched theory is manifest below @xmath10 and the expectation value of the polyakov loop is zero then . above @xmath10",
    "the center symmetry becomes broken spontaneously and the polyakov loop acquires a non - vanishing expectation value .",
    "its phase spontaneously selects one of the three ( for su(3 ) ) values , @xmath53 .",
    "one of the original motivations @xcite for analyzing the connection between boundary conditions and the dirac spectrum , was to find out , how the change of the polyakov loop at the phase transition affects properties of spectral sums of dirac eigenvalues .",
    "the polyakov loop is an order parameter for confinement , while certain spectral sums of the dirac operator , e.g. , the one in eq .",
    "( [ condensatesum ] ) , are related to chiral symmetry . thus understanding the relation between the polyakov loop and the dirac spectrum",
    "might provide an understanding of a possible relation between chiral symmetry breaking and deconfinement .",
    "it is natural to expect that the dirac operator and its spectral properties connect both , confinement and chiral symmetry .",
    "after all , the quark - propagator , i.e. , the inverse dirac operator , should know whether the quark it describes is in the chirally symmetric or the chirally broken phase , and if it is confined or not .    for understanding the relation between the chiral condensate and the polyakov loop we write the condensate in a rather general form : the chiral condensate is a gauge invariant quantity , and as such may be written as a sum of ( traced ) gauge transporters along closed loops on the lattice , @xmath54 here",
    "@xmath55 is the set of all loops that contribute , @xmath56 is an individual loop in this set , @xmath57 a complex valued coefficient , and the product runs over all links in @xmath56 .",
    "we remark that the structure in eq .",
    "( [ loopexpansion ] ) is universal and different lattice discretizations of the lattice dirac operator only lead to different values for the coefficients @xmath57 .    on a finite lattice it is possible to order all loops @xmath56 in ( [ loopexpansion ] ) according to their winding number @xmath58 around the compact time direction .",
    "if we implement the boundary condition ( [ fermionbc ] ) , then the loops pick up a phase @xmath59 with every winding .",
    "thus we can write the condensate for the general boundary condition ( [ fermionbc ] ) as @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the set of all loops that wind exactly @xmath58-times . using a fourier transformation with respect to the boundary angle we can project to the contributions that wind exactly once , and in this way define the dual chiral condensate @xmath62 , @xmath63 where we used @xmath64 in the second step .",
    "the dual chiral condensate @xmath62 consists of the loops of the conventional chiral condensate , but restricted to winding number 1 .",
    "these loops , however , transform under a center transformation in exactly the same way as the polyakov loop .",
    "consequently , @xmath62 also serves as an order parameter for the breaking of the center symmetry and thus in the quenched case is an order parameter for confinement .",
    "we remark that the technique of using a fourier transformation with respect to the boundary angle has been used in various contexts , in particular for the construction of canonical determinants , i.e. , fermion determinants that describe a fixed quark number .",
    "we stress at this point , that we have not performed the limits @xmath65 and @xmath66 in the definition ( [ dualconddef1 ] ) of the dual chiral condensate , but of course these two limits are necessary when one wants to use @xmath62 for the analysis of chiral symmetry . on the other hand ,",
    "since the weight factors @xmath57 in ( [ dualconddef1 ] ) behave for large @xmath18 as @xmath67 , where @xmath68 is the length of the loop @xmath56 , the infinite mass limit reduces the dual condensate @xmath62 to the shortest loops that wind exactly once , i.e. , the conventional straight polyakov loops .    for a practical evaluation of the dual condensate",

    "obviously the dual chiral condensate vanishes below @xmath36 mev , while above the transition it acquires a non - vanishing value which rises quickly with @xmath73 .",
    "it is remarkable that the data points from the rather different ensembles fall essentially on a universal curve , which can not a - priori be expected for an unrenormalized quantity ( the conventional thin polyakov loop is a counterexample ) .",

    "in particular the following qualitative features were demonstrated :    * for low temperature the chiral condensate is essentially independent of the boundary conditions . at high temperature",
    "it varies with the boundary angle @xmath24 , and has a minimum for anti - periodic boundary conditions , i.e. , @xmath83 .",
    "this observation holds for the dynamical case as well as for quenched configurations in the real polyakov loop sector . for the quenched case with configurations in the complex polyakov loop sectors the @xmath24 dependence",
    "is shifted by @xmath49 .",
    "* for low temperatures the spectrum of the dirac operator is insensitive to changing boundary conditions , while above @xmath10 the ir modes show a sine - like dependence on the boundary angle @xmath24 . for the quenched case ,",
    "again the variation pattern with @xmath24 is shifted by @xmath49 when ensembles for the complex polyakov loop sectors are considered .",
    "the sensitivity of the eigenvalues to changing boundary conditions decreases quickly as one moves towards the uv end of the spectrum . *",
    "the dual chiral condensate is defined as the first fourier component of the conventional chiral condensate with respect to the boundary angle @xmath24 , and thus is an observable testing the sensitivity to the boundary conditions .",
    "furthermore , under center rotations ( flips ) it transforms like the polyakov loop and thus is also an order parameter for center symmetry . in the quenched case it is zero below @xmath10 and non - vanishing above @xmath10 . for the fully dynamical case it is essentially real and positive , with a small but non - vanishing value below @xmath10 , and a quickly increasing value above the transition .",
    "we stress again that the results for the dynamical case still have a preliminary character ( see the last paragraph of section 3 ) .",
    "however , the fact that also for the full theory the finite temperature transition goes along with a strong increase of the sensitivity to temporal fermionic boundary conditions is certainly established .    at this place",
    "one may speculate what excitations of the gluon field could drive the effects observed in the fermionic spectra .",
    "dyons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) are natural candidates as their index theorem @xcite is sensitive to the boundary conditions : for dyons of given electric and magnetic charge the zero modes exist only in a certain range of boundary angles",
    ". these zero modes then mix and form a near - zero mode band .",
    "dyons can be combined into calorons @xcite , which are neutral and always possess zero modes , the latter then hop between the constituent dyons @xcite .    in a dyon gas model",
    "the different dyons appear independently according to their masses , which in turn are governed by the holonomy . for",
    "a holonomy corresponding to the confined phase all dyons are equally abundant and changing the boundary conditions will therefore not affect the number of zero modes . for a holonomy corresponding to the deconfined phase , however ,",
    "some dyons become heavier than others and the abundance of zero modes depends on the boundary angle . for su(2 )",
    "the relation to the angle of the polyakov loop is just as described above @xcite .",
    "this suppression effect has been investigated on the lattice @xcite and might also explain the decrease of the topological susceptibility above @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "these ideas certainly should be substantiated further with lattice methods  a task which we leave for future studies .",
    "another interesting and important challenge is to analyze the role of temporal boundary conditions as a tool for probing finite temperature qcd using non - lattice methods .",
    "only very little has been attempted in this direction so far @xcite .",
    "understanding better the response of the system to changing boundary conditions certainly will help to characterize the phases of qcd and the mechanisms driving the transition .",
