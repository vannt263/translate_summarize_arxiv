    "the search for general classes of solutions of the einstein equations that either have pure vacuum for their source or a non - zero cosmological constant , that are of petrov type n , and have principal null rays with non - zero twist has been continuing for a very long time now .",
    "we will use the ( relatively common ) nomenclature `` einstein spaces '' for solutions with this sort of a source , i.e. , either the pure vacuum or that vacuum with a non - zero cosmological constant , @xmath0 , appended to it .",
    "with this idea firmly in mind , there are only two solutions known so far for twisting type n einstein spaces : the one described by i. hauser @xcite , which has @xmath3 , and the one by j. leroy @xcite , with a non - zero value for @xmath0 , but which in the limit as @xmath4 degenerates to a flat solution , rather than one of type n. because of the apparent difficulty of the problem , many different approaches have been used to attempt the finding of such a solution . with a requirement of one or more killing vectors",
    ", the problem can be reduced to the solution of a single , nonlinear ode , which has been produced in several forms by different authors @xcite ; nonetheless this approach has produced no new solutions .",
    "looking at the problem as a reduction from complex - valued manifolds via plebaski s hyperheavenly equation @xcite has produced no new solutions @xcite .",
    "therefore we were quite interested when we became aware of a different approach via a recent paper by pawe nurowski @xcite , looking for exact solutions of this type with non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "many of nurowski s research articles use the fact that one can productively study ( 4-dimensional ) lorentz geometries which admit a shearfree , geodesic null congruence of curves by viewing the 3-parameter space that picks out any particular curve in the congruence , as a ( 3-dimensional ) cr structure @xcite . in @xcite , he and his collaborators use the cr function in such a structure to create a very appropriate choice of coordinates for a twisting type n einstein space , and reduce the einstein equations to a set of nonlinear pde s for a couple of functions of three variables . then in @xcite , he makes a clever ansatz depending only on a single variable and discovers a particular twisting solution ; unfortunately that solution turns out to be the same as the one mentioned above as first found by leroy , as he notes in a more recent paper @xcite .",
    "however , we were quite intrigued by the approach and have made some efforts to follow it through with the hopes of obtaining more general solutions of the equations in nurowski s article .",
    "a spacetime of type n allows one , and only one , congruence of twisting , shearfree , null geodesics , referred to as a principal null direction ( pnd ) ; this ( 3-parameter ) family of null geodesics allows the option to choose a single coordinate @xmath5 along any such geodesic , and to associate the other three degrees of freedom in the parameter space as a model for a cr manifold .",
    "we first insist that our manifold admit a killing vector in the real direction in this ( 3-dimensional ) cr manifold , so that the remaining unknown functions depend only on the complex coordinates there , and then calculate the ( infinite - dimensional ) classical symmetries for the system .",
    "this allows us to derive a quite simple nonlinear third - order ode which the invariant solutions of the classical symmetries must satisfy .",
    "because this equation does not contain the independent variable explicitly , it can be immediately reduced to the following second - order ode , for @xmath6 , with two slightly different forms that differ by a constant : @xmath7 we are then able to show that the leroy - nurowski solution is indeed a special solution for this equation . at this point",
    "it is worthwhile to introduce a question as to how one knows that the new solution of nurowski does indeed describe locally the same manifold as the solution found by leroy .",
    "the method was originally created by e. cartan @xcite to prove equivalencies of cr structures , without the need of actually determining an explicit coordinate transformation between the two sets of coordinates on two manifolds .",
    "instead , one determines the values of a set of invariant quantities for a cr structure , the same for all equivalent such structures .",
    "therefore it is necessary to calculate the invariants for leroy s solution and compare them with the ones already known to nurowski for his solution , noting that they are the same constants .",
    "we have therefore also calculated these invariants for our class of solutions , which we find to be quite different .    for the case",
    "when the constant @xmath8 in ( [ geqn ] ) is zero , an integral transformation may be performed to reduce that equation further , to a first - order ode of abel type , for @xmath9 : @xmath10 which , quite unfortunately , we have not been able to identify as any of the known solvable types of abel equations @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , we believe that these two equations , at the time of publication , are the simplest odes available that determine nontrivial twisting type n einstein spaces . returning to the case when @xmath11 , our current examinations suggest the possibility that the solutions of this equation might define a new class of transcendental functions , which constitutes the major result of this paper , establishing a new set of solutions to the type n problem with @xmath12 . the remainder of the paper will describe the process involved in this and our reasons for stating that these are indeed new solutions . in particular , we will present solutions to in the forms of power series and puiseux series , both shown to be locally convergent .",
    "although prior to this time there were indeed only two known twisting type n einstein spaces , it is always worth remembering that the solution space for the problem is in fact quite large .",
    "it has been shown by sommers @xcite that the full set of solutions for type n is given by two complex functions of two real variables .",
    "surely the requirement of non - zero twist puts a very strong constraint on this , but it is expected that there should be a large number of new analytic functions involved in the full solution of the twisting type n problem .",
    "as already mentioned those ( 4-dimensional ) lorentz geometries which admit a shearfree , geodesic null congruence of curves have some history of people using cr structures to study them .",
    "they were first introduced into mathematics by poincar and extensively studied by e. cartan @xcite .",
    "good sources of background on the relation of these two geometric concepts may be found , for instance in the thesis of nurowski @xcite , and also in the very detailed discussion of their use for einstein spaces in his article with hill and lewandowski @xcite , which generalized earlier work to include the possibility of a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "the approach to a lorentz - signature manifold begins with the usual form for the metric @xcite in terms of a basis of 4 null 1-forms , modified for our choice of signature , @xmath13 : @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the complex conjugate of @xmath16 while @xmath17 and @xmath18 are real , and the product is the usual symmetric product of 1-forms to create the metric . for einstein spaces of type n , which have only one pnd",
    ", we call its tangent vector @xmath19 , which is a well - defined vector field in the neighborhood of each point , and take @xmath20 as its dual 1-form .",
    "the requirement that the twist of @xmath19 should be non - zero is equivalent to the restriction that @xmath21 .",
    "we also choose a real coordinate @xmath5 as a parameter along this congruence , and a real function @xmath22 on the manifold so that @xmath23 ( @xmath24 , @xmath25 ) .",
    "this congruence , still locally , is a 3-parameter family of null shearfree geodesics , so that at each value of @xmath5 , the manifold still needs three additional coordinates . following the work described in detail in @xcite ,",
    "one is able to describe those degrees of freedom as coming from a 3-dimensional , strictly pseudoconvex cr manifold , @xmath26 , equipped with ( at least ) one non - constant cr function @xmath27 , and classes of pairs of 1-forms @xmath28 ( real ) and @xmath29 ( complex ) such that @xmath30 with @xmath31 a complex - valued function on @xmath26 .",
    "a cr structure is a 3-dimensional real manifold @xmath26 equipped with an equivalence class of pairs of 1-forms , @xmath32 , as above .",
    "another pair @xmath33 is considered equivalent to @xmath32 , and therefore simply another representative of the same equivalence class , iff there are functions @xmath34 ( real ) and @xmath35 , @xmath36 ( complex ) on @xmath26 such that @xmath37 this cr manifold can be lifted into a spacetime , so that the tetrad may be displayed in the following way @xcite : @xmath38 of course this is exactly the form that a spacetime with such a distinguished pnd is supposed to have @xcite .",
    "referring back to , we can see that the twist is just proportional to @xmath39 . using to determine this , we see that these forms have been chosen to put the non - zero character of the twist very clearly in evidence as non - zero . however , still looking at those equations , the function @xmath31 that appears there is quite an important new function on the manifold . using the closure of the equations in",

    ", the equations and @xmath60 together do imply the requirement @xmath61 .",
    "this tells us that within the established formalism the twisting type n solutions to the einstein equations automatically satisfy the condition for an einstein space , i.e. , vacuum with or without a cosmological constant . for @xmath3 ,",
    "the statement is obviously true ( see also @xcite p.451 ) and was used in @xcite to prove the cr embeddability of twisting type n vacuums , without cosmological constant . for @xmath62 , one uses to substitute the term @xmath63 in @xmath52 and notices that the resulting expression is a linear combination of @xmath64 and @xmath53 .",
    "the equation @xmath61 is therefore superfluous for the type n problem , which facilitates our calculation greatly .",
    "it is useful to understand the meaning of the operator @xmath66 by introducing a real coordinate system @xmath67 on @xmath26 such that we have @xmath68 with @xmath69 a complex - valued function @xcite .",
    "in addition , the function @xmath70 relates to the function @xmath31 in the following way @xmath71    one major difficulty of fully solving the system ( [ tn1]-[tn3 ] ) is that unlike ordinary coordinate differentiations , the selected ( dual ) basis for the tangent space is not commutative , and , even worse , the operator @xmath66 itself involves the unknown function @xmath31 .",
    "when this dependence on the real coordinates is written out explicitly , the original pdes become formidably lengthy . instead of facing this entire conundrum ,",
    "we have decided to circumvent it , at least in this paper , by looking at the special case where the unknowns @xmath47 and @xmath31 have no @xmath65-dependence , i.e. , @xmath72 .",
    "geometrically speaking , we insist that the spacetime admits a killing vector in the @xmath65-direction .",
    "such an assumption simplifies the problem greatly in that one can treat the operator @xmath66 the same as @xmath73 , when acting on either @xmath47 or @xmath31 .",

    "this asymptotic behaviour at infinity , consistent with our numerical calculations , again suggests that we may significantly extend the radius of convergence for at least in the real domain .",

    "we have begun with the advantage of prior work done on the use of ( 3-dimensional ) cr manifolds to look for solutions of the einstein field equations that correspond to algebraically - degenerate einstein spaces , with twisting principal null directions . a general solution of those reduced field equations for the two functions of three variables would generate all twisting solutions of petrov type n. of course we did not achieve this ; however ,",
    "after the assumption of a single killing vector in a particular direction , our ansatz for group - invariant solutions obtained from the infinite - dimensional classical symmetries of the field equations , allowed us to obtain a single ode , the solutions of which would generate a family of solutions of type n with twisting principal null directions . that ode is either a rather simple , third - order nonlinear equation for @xmath119 in which the independent variable @xmath115 does not appear or , equivalently , an even simpler , second - order nonlinear equation for @xmath6 , where @xmath2 is a dimensionless re - scaling of @xmath258 and @xmath36 is a re - scaling of @xmath259 , which includes a non - zero value for @xmath0 , the cosmological constant . within the same ansatz",
    ", we have also investigated all the cases of solutions corresponding to conformally flat spacetimes to which type n solutions may degenerate , which helps us look for non - trivial cases .",
    "we have studied this second - order equation at some length .",
    "in particular it contains one parameter , @xmath112 , which may always be re - scaled to the value @xmath260 unless it happens to be zero . in the case",
    "that it is zero , the equation can be reduced still further , to a first - order equation of abel type . following standard approaches to abel equations we were unable to determine any method that we thought would generate reasonable type n solutions , although this is still an ongoing project of considerable interest .",
    "however , when @xmath112 is not zero we have considered various sorts of solutions which it might have . we have shown that it does have solutions which are holomorphic , in the complex plane in a neighborhood of the origin , and have found an asymptotic behavior near the ( real ) infinity .",
    "in particular we have picked out especially those solutions which are even functions of @xmath2 and looked at power - series solutions about the origin , both analytically and numerically via a maple computer program .",
    "we have determined a moderately - simple recursion relation for the coefficients of the powers of @xmath261 in the series solutions , which determines the coefficient @xmath262 , of @xmath263 ( @xmath234 ) in terms of all the previous coefficients , looking at all of them as determined by the value of @xmath264 .",
    "this series terminates quickly for just two particular values of @xmath251 , in the form @xmath265 , with @xmath44 constant , different for the two values of @xmath251 .",
    "the value @xmath236 generates the previously - known leroy - nurowski solution , while the other one @xmath238 is unfortunately simply a conformally flat solution . to ensure that these series solutions are distinct from the leroy - nurowski solution , we have used the work of cartan on the question of the equivalence of two cr manifolds , which requires the equality of the set of six cartan invariants",
    "we have found that any value of @xmath251 between these two special values generates cartan invariants that are quite different from those at the endpoints of this interval , and therefore distinct from those of the leroy - nurowski solution .",
    "the solutions characterized by values of @xmath251 between @xmath241 and @xmath249 have an asymptotic behavior , via a puiseux series around the ( real ) infinity , that has the same form @xmath266 as the conformally flat solution aforementioned , but also lower - order terms involving third - roots of @xmath2 , which doubtless generate algebraic singularities there .",
    "numerical integrations via maple agree with this behavior , showing negative values of @xmath1 as needed and very simple structure , for all real values of @xmath2 .",
    "the same numerical integrations do show singularities in the solutions for @xmath267 . as well , numerical calculations of the coefficients @xmath262 , for several values of @xmath268 ( e.g. , @xmath269 ) show that starting at a large enough @xmath19 , they alternate in sign while their absolute values are monotonically decreasing at rapid rates .",
    "we therefore postulate that these solutions are everywhere non - singular and well - behaved on the real axis , and believe that they might define new well - behaved , transcendental functions with algebraic singularities off the real @xmath2-axis .",
    "the proof of such a conjecture is still being pursued ; nonetheless , we feel that the numerical calculations justify the belief that this is a sufficiently interesting result as to merit the attention of a wider audience .    to conclude the discussion , we present here our new class of metrics , which",
    ", without loss of generality , may be considered by setting @xmath206 in the ansatz .",
    "although we will present it here with the new real coordinate @xmath115 introduced in , with this choice of @xmath153 it is the same as the usual coordinate @xmath74 used in . as well , our studies with the equation for @xmath129 , equivalently @xmath1 , allow us to replace @xmath115 by its form in terms of @xmath258 as determining the imaginary part of @xmath270 , via @xmath271 , namely , @xmath272 for simplicity of presentation , we show both forms below , with coordinates @xmath273 or @xmath274 : @xmath275\\ ] ] with real - valued @xmath119 , @xmath276 and @xmath277 such that @xmath278 where @xmath112 is an arbitrary real parameter .",

    "we can here note the philosophy that certain odes themselves may serve the purpose of defining _ new _ transcendental functions ; for instance , we recall the painlev functions and the associated odes .",
    "hence our situation with new type n solutions being determined by a second - order _ nonlinear _ ode is presumably not too different from that of hauser s solution ( in terms of hypergeometric functions @xcite ) which is determined by a second - order _ linear _ ode , although it is true that there has already been much more extensive studies made on the properties of hypergeometric functions than have been made for newer functions defined by solutions of nonlinear odes that may not even have the painlev property .",
    "the equation actually does have the following special solution @xmath285 however , it can be shown to correspond to a conformally flat solution , and hence is not interesting .",
    "unfortunately , we have had no luck so far finding the general solution to or any other special solution other than . since constructing",
    "the general solution to the generic abel ode has remained an open problem for decades , the general strategy of integration nowadays mainly lies in recognizing , within a suitable class of transformations , the ode in question as equivalent to a previously solved equation .",

    "other attempts by us , such as the symmetry method , on finding special solutions all have failed or just led to .",
    "so far we have not been able to find a similar reduction for the ode with @xmath198 , nor can we negate the possibility that with @xmath198 may contain different type n solutions other than the case with @xmath130 .",
    "in fact , the cartan invariants calculated with generally do have a dependence on the constant @xmath112 even though this is not the case for all the conformally flat solutions and the leroy - nurowski solution ( see and ) .",

    "we have three odes , , and at hand that may be explored for new twisting type n solutions .",
    "a particular , probably useful way to decide which one of these equations has a better chance for one to find a solution is given by the ( weak ) painlev test @xcite .",
    "this test reveals the nature of the movable singularities of the general solution of a nonlinear ode .",
    "failing the test means the occurrence of certain undesirable movable singularities , e.g. , infinitely branched singularities , that relate to non - integrability @xcite , although it may still be possible to find special solutions .",
    "associated to the ( weak ) painlev test is the global property called the ( weak ) painlev property .",
    "an ode possesses the painlev property if the general solution can be made single - valued . for the weak painlev property",
    ", it requires that the general solution be at most finitely branched around any movable singularity .",
    "the tests themselves are by design sets of necessary conditions respectively for these properties .    in this appendix",

    ", we detail the test procedures on .",
    "then we briefly comment on and simply point out where the tests fail for without dwelling on details .",
    "the equation surely does not have the painlev property for the coefficient of the @xmath304 term clearly violates the necessary conditions for the painlev property @xcite ( see p.127 ) .",

    "* remark * note that no _ pole _ is detected from the test above .",
    "the ode for @xmath326 still involves a puisuex series instead of a laurent series since the cubing does not eliminate all third roots of @xmath327 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the presence of movable algebraic singularities is not incompatible with integrability .    the very design of the weak painlev test limits its usage only as necessary conditions for the weak painlev property .",
    "the test can neither detect movable ( branched ) essential singularities themselves nor exclude an accumulation of algebraic singularities forming a movable essential one that may be severely branched .",
    "these possibilities make a rigorous proof of the weak painlev property not at all a trivial one , which by itself may deserve a specialized article to discuss .",
    "see examples in @xcite .    according to painlev @xcite ,",
    "the only movable singularities of solutions to the first - order ode @xmath328 where @xmath329 is rational in @xmath74 with coefficients that are algebraic functions of @xmath330 , are poles and/or algebraic branch points .",
    "in addition , the only nonlinear ode in this class that has the painlev property is the riccati equation which is certainly not .",
    "hence the equation automatically has the weak painlev property , but not the painlev property , and it is free from movable essential singularities .    the equation admits two families of dominant behaviours ( cf . and ):",

    "this means that has an infinitely branched movable singularity , which is a strong indicator for non - integrability @xcite .    since our attempt of solving",
    "has not been successful , we decided to focus on and explore some of its features that may facilitate constructing new solutions .",
