    "as an interstellar cloud collapses to form a star , the magnetic field lines threading the cloud are expected to be dragged along with the infalling gas , producing an hourglass - shaped field pattern centered on the star ( e.g. , galli & shu 1993 ) . in many theoretical models the field is then wound up by rotation in a circumstellar disk , producing a toroidal field component which collimates the outflow from the star into two oppositely directed lobes ; the outflow carries away angular momentum , allowing further accretion onto the star @xcite .",
    "so far the observational evidence for pinched or twisted fields near young stars is scant , although there are possible detections toward w3 @xcite , mon  r2 @xcite , and a number of other cloud cores @xcite .",
    "these observations used the linearly polarized emission from circumstellar dust to probe the magnetic field morphology . spinning dust grains",
    "tend to align their long axes perpendicular to the magnetic field , so thermal emission from the grains is polarized perpendicular to the field .    toward the orion molecular cloud , @xcite found evidence for a large scale hourglass distortion of the magnetic field from dust polarization observations at 100 and 350  @xmath5 m .",
    "the pinched region has a radius of @xmath60.5 pc ( 200 ) and is centered 0.1 pc southwest of the kleinmann - low nebula , a site of high mass star formation . on smaller scales , within the orion - kl complex , @xcite found evidence for a twisted field within roughly 1500 au ( 3 ) of the star irc2 , based on imaging polarimetry of the 2  @xmath5 m s(1 ) line of h@xmath7 .",
    "the line emission , assumed unpolarized , originates from shock - excited h@xmath7 in the bipolar outflow from irc2 .",
    "absorption by aligned grains in front of the outflow produces the polarization .",
    "@xcite also found evidence for a twisted field near irc2 from 1.5  resolution polarization maps at 12.5  @xmath5 m and 17  @xmath5 m .",
    "spectropolarimetry of the 813 and 1622  @xmath5 m bands was used to separate the effects of absorption and emission , which lead to polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field , respectively .",
    "@xcite obtained 4  resolution interferometric maps of orion - kl at wavelengths of 1.3 and 3.5  mm , where the dust emission is certainly optically thin .",
    "these maps showed an abrupt 90  change in the polarization angle southeast of irc2 , in agreement with the infrared data .",
    "but because the region of anomalous polarization was suspiciously coincident with the redshifted lobe of the bipolar outflow from irc2 , rao et al . suggested that dust grains in this zone might be aligned by a wind from the star , rather than by the usual davis - greenstein mechanism .",
    "if the grains are mechanically aligned then thermal emission can be polarized parallel to the magnetic field , so there is no need to conclude that the field is kinked .",
    "unfortunately , polarized dust emission from irc2 may not be a reliable probe of the magnetic field near the central star because of confusion by dust emission from the surrounding molecular cloud .",
    "the stellar position is coincident with radio source ` i ' @xcite .",
    "the irc2 infrared peak is offset @xmath61  northwest of source i , while the millimeter - wavelength peak is offset @xmath61  southeast of source i , toward the ` hot core ' clump .",
    "the radio spectrum of source  i itself from 8  ghz to 86  ghz is consistent with free - free emission from ionized gas in a circumstellar shell ; there is no evidence for excess flux at 86  ghz which would be the signature of circumstellar dust @xcite .",
    "by contrast , sio masers do unambiguously originate in gas very close to source  i. intense masers in the v=1 vibrational level are confined to a zone approximately 40 au from the star @xcite , while weaker masers in the ground vibrational state are found 100700  au from the star , in an elongated , bowtie - shaped region @xcite .",
    "both the v=1 and v=0 masers are linearly polarized @xcite .",
    "since the maser polarization direction is expected , under many circumstances , to be parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field direction @xcite , sio masers may provide the best probe of the magnetic field morphology within 700  au of source  i. indeed , from early measurements showing a symmetric rotation of the polarization angle across the double - peaked v=1 maser spectrum , @xcite concluded that the magnetic field direction rotated with azimuth in a disk around the star .    here",
    "we discuss polarization measurements of both the v=0 and v=1 sio masers toward orion - irc2 obtained with 0.5  angular resolution , @xmath6250  au at the distance of orion .",
    "we find that the polarization of the v=1 maser is time variable , casting doubt upon its usefulness as a probe of the magnetic field .",
    "however , the v=0 maser polarization appears to be a good probe of the field morphology .",
    "it provides little evidence for pinched or twisted fields near the star .",
    "observations were made between 1996 june and 2001 march with the bima array .",
    "orion - kl was observed using the a , b , and c antenna configurations , providing antenna separations from 6.3  m to 1.8  km .",
    "the correlator was configured to allow simultaneous observations of the  sio transitions in both the v=1 and v=0 vibrational states , at frequencies of 86.243 and 86.847 ghz .",
    "the velocity resolution was 0.34  .",
    "single sideband system temperatures , scaled to outside the atmosphere , ranged from 170  k to 350  k. the data were calibrated and analysed using the miriad software package @xcite .",
    "the receivers are sensitive to a single linear polarization , but are equipped with movable quarter wave plates to observe right or left circular polarization . as described by @xcite , each receiver was switched between lcp and rcp with a walsh function pattern in order to sample all possible crosscorrelations ( rr , rl , lr , ll ) on each baseline as rapidly as possible .",
    "the integration time for each observation was 11.5 seconds .",
    "the data were self - calibrated on the strongest v=1 maser feature , using the ll and rr crosscorrelations , then averaged in 5 minute blocks to produce quasi - simultaneous dual polarization observations .",
    "the quarter wave plates are designed for a frequency of  89 ghz , where they have a leakage to the unwanted polarization of around 1% . at 86  ghz",
    "the leakage is about 3% .",
    "we calibrate the leakage by observing a point source over a wide range of hour angle . for altitude - azimuth antennas",
    "the phase of a linearly polarized source rotates with the parallactic angle , whereas the leakage terms are constant .",
    "we used observations of 3c273 , 3c279 , and the sio v=1 maser itself to calibrate the leakage .",
    "the measured polarizations of both the v=1 and v=0 masers are quite insensitive to the leakage correction : for the weakly polarized v=1 line , the source is unresolved and the leakage averages out over the wide range of parallactic angles observed , while for the v=0 line the source polarization is much larger than the leakage .",
    "images were made for a range of weightings of the uv - data . with uniform weighting",
    "the synthesised beam is @xmath8 fwhm .",
    "for the final images we used robust weighting , deconvolved using the clean algorithm , and convolved with a circular @xmath0 fwhm gaussian beam .",
    "figure  [ fig : f1 ] summarizes the observational results for the v=1 masers over a 3.5 year period . for each of 6 epochs ,",
    "we plot the total intensity , fractional polarization , and polarization position angle across the double - peaked spectrum .",
    "all 3 quantities vary on time scales of years .",
    "the fractional polarization usually is less than 10% , and tends to be anticorrelated with maser intensity  that is , the strongest maser features typically have the lowest fractional polarization .",
    "the weak maser feature near v@xmath9  7  which appeared in 1999 has an anomalously high fractional polarization of 30% .",
    "the polarization position angles vary considerably across the line profiles , although a crude median value is p.a .",
    "@xmath6 80 , shown by the dashed line in figure  [ fig : f1 ] . often the position angle `` kinks '' at the peak of a maser feature .",
    "the symmetric pattern of polarization position angles seen in the 1996 august data is similar in character to that measured by @xcite in 1981 june .",
    "the v=1 masers are unresolved in 0.5  resolution images .",
    "nevertheless , the high signal to noise ratio of the maps , in excess of 5000:1 on the strongest maser features , allows us to fit the _ centroid _ of the maser position in each velocity channel to an accuracy of @xmath10 .",
    "the centroids are arranged in an 0.15  diameter ring with a stable , systematic velocity pattern @xcite . in figure",
    "[ fig : f2 ] , the polarization vectors for individual 1  velocity channels are plotted on the corresponding centroid positions for 3 different epochs .",
    "variations in the polarization angle do not appear to correlate with movements of spots .",
    "below we argue that the polarization angles of the v=1 masers may be determined by the maser beaming direction , rather than the magnetic field , accounting for the time variability .",
    "@xcite were able to fit the v=1 maser spectrum and centroid positions with a model of maser emission from a rotating , expanding disk .",
    "higher resolution , vlba observations @xcite show , however , that the strongest maser features are clustered into four groups , plausibly in the walls of the bipolar outflow from source  i. although doeleman et al .",
    "emphasize the differences between the disk and outflow models , the distinctions are in part semantic  the disk modeled by plambeck et al . had a sharp inner radius of 40 au and a thickness of 40 au , and the maser pump rate and sio density were fitted to obtain particularly strong maser emission from the inner walls of this cylinder , not so different from the outflow model .",
    "nevertheless , it is clear that the velocity field hypothesized by plambeck et al .",
    "is an oversimplification .",
    "the bulk of the v=0  sio emission from the orion - kl core is thermal .",
    "much of it originates from high velocity gas in the bipolar outflow from irc2 @xcite . with arcsecond angular resolution ,",
    "most of this extended emission is resolved out , revealing a bright `` bowtie '' centered on source  i. the peak brightness temperatures in the bowtie are @xmath11  k , almost certainly indicating maser emission @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : f3 ] compares total intensity and polarized spectra of orion - irc2 generated from high and low resolution maps .",
    "the _ polarized _ flux densities integrated over @xmath12 and @xmath13 boxes are nearly identical , indicating that most of the polarized emission originates from the masers .",
    "sio channel maps with @xmath0 resolution are shown in figure  [ fig : f4 ] .",
    "the r.m.s .",
    "noise in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 stokes intensity maps is @xmath60.05  jy / beam .",
    "polarization vectors are overlaid wherever the linearly polarized flux @xmath16 is detected with @xmath17 or greater significance ; hence the polarization position angles shown are uncertain by @xmath18 .",
    "apart from a slight twist of the polarization vectors at the northern edge of the v@xmath9  12.5  map , there are no obvious systematic changes in polarization angle with velocity or position . the polarization direction , p.a .",
    "@xmath6 80 , is offset by 30  from the long axis of the bowtie .",
    "the fractional polarization is as high as 50% in the channels near the upper and lower edges of the line profile , near v@xmath9  @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the sio linewidths in the bowtie are too large for this gas to be gravitationally bound to source  i. the `` shell '' h@xmath7o masers in orion - irc2 overlie the inner regions of the bowtie .",
    "proper motion measurements show that these masers are moving outward from source  i at @xmath620  , perpendicular to the axis of the high velocity outflow @xcite .",
    "probably the v=0 sio masers and h@xmath7o masers are part of a low velocity outflow which is pushing into , or around , dense gas in the equatorial plane of the star , plausibly the remnants of the `` pseudodisk '' which formed in the intial collapse of the cloud @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that a magnetic field with a strength of a few milligauss can affect an sio maser in any observable way , given that the zeeman splitting @xmath2 induced by the field is orders of magnitude smaller than the maser linewidth @xmath21 . for sio , @xmath22 hz / milligauss @xcite , while individual maser features have linewidths of order 0.5 , or @xmath23 hz .",
    "nevertheless , polarization arises because of the selection rules which govern dipole transitions between energy levels .",
    "radiation polarized parallel to the field can not change the component of molecular angular momentum @xmath24 along the field direction , hence @xmath25 ; conversely , @xmath26 for radiation polarized perpendicular to the field @xcite .",
    "these rules cause the maser gain to differ for polarizations parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "a simple example given by @xcite illustrates this mechanism . consider a maser in the  transition . in the presence of a magnetic field , the j=1 state is split into 3 sublevels ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "if a maser beam propagates at right angles to the field , radiation polarized parallel to the field induces transitions only from the @xmath28 state to the @xmath29 state , while radiation polarized perpendicular to the field induces transitions from both the @xmath30 and @xmath31 states to the @xmath29 state .",
    "if the pumping rates into the 3 upper sublevels are equal , and if the maser is saturated  that is , every excitation to the upper state leads to the emission of a maser photon  then two photons polarized perpendicular to the field are emitted for every one photon polarized parallel to the field .",
    "hence the net fractional linear polarization is 1/3 , perpendicular to the field .    in the more general situation where the maser propagates at angle @xmath32 with respect to the field , radiation polarized parallel to the projected field direction couples to all 3 magnetic sublevels , while that polarized perpendicular to the field couples only to the @xmath33 sublevels .",
    "hence , as @xmath34 decreases from @xmath35 toward 0 , the gain of the parallel component increases while the gain of the perpendicular component decreases . in the limit @xmath36 , where @xmath1 is the stimulated emission rate and @xmath37 is the decay rate from collisions or spontaneous emission , @xcite show that the net linear polarization for a  maser is perpendicular to the projected field for @xmath38(@xmath39 ) , and parallel to the projected field for @xmath40 .",
    "@xcite found that these same asymptotic limits applied to the  rotational transition .",
    "in addition , they considered the case where the magnetic sublevels were pumped unequally , which can easily occur if the vibrational energy levels are excited by an anisotropic radiation field , for example by infrared photons from a nearby star .",
    "small differences in the absolute populations of these sublevels correspond to large fractional differences in the population inversion , and hence the maser gain .",
    "therefore , anisotropic pumping tends to enhance the fractional polarization , and also changes the angle @xmath34 at which the polarization flips from perpendicular to parallel .",
    "nonetheless , as long as @xmath41 and @xmath37 , the net linear polarization is either parallel or perpendicular to the projected field direction .",
    "unhappily , the requirement @xmath41 is likely to be violated for intense masers , for which the stimulated emission rate @xmath1 becomes large . as @xmath1 increases , the `` good '' quantum axis shifts from the magnetic field direction to the propagation direction of the maser beam .",
    "calculations by @xcite show that the position angle of the linear polarization is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the projected magnetic field in this case , over a broad range of maser intensities .",
    "for example , figure 3 of nedoluha & watson shows that the polarization position angle for a  sio maser propagating at 15  to the magnetic field direction shifts from 20  for @xmath42 , to 80  for @xmath43 . as the maser intensity increases and @xmath1 exceeds @xmath2 , the calculations also show that the fractional polarization decreases",
    ".      the v=1 sio masers near irc2 are sufficiently intense that the stimulated emission rate @xmath1 almost certainly is larger than the zeeman splitting @xmath2 .",
    "the brighter  maser spots in the vlba map of @xcite have flux densities of 1  jy in an 0.2 milliarcsecond beam , corresponding to brightness temperatures of @xmath44 k. to estimate the stimulated emission rate @xmath1 for an sio molecule near the surface of such a maser , one must guess the solid angle @xmath45 into which the maser radiation is beamed . taking @xmath46 steradians , @xmath47 where @xmath48 is the einstein b coefficient for the @xmath49 transition , @xmath15 is the radiation energy density in ergs  @xmath50  hz@xmath51 , @xmath52 esu - cm is the dipole moment for sio , and @xmath53 is the maser s specific intensity . for comparison ,",
    "the spontaneous radiative decay rate from the v=1 to the v=0 vibrational level is 5 s@xmath51 @xcite and the collision rate in 1000  k gas with density @xmath54  @xmath50  is @xmath61  s@xmath51 , using the total rate coefficient @xmath55  @xmath56 s@xmath51 ( @xmath57  k ) given by @xcite . since @xmath58 , the maser is saturated .    in order to fulfill the requirement @xmath41 , magnetic fields @xmath59300  mg",
    "would be required . for a 300  mg field",
    "the magnetic pressure @xmath60 is 25 times greater than the thermal pressure @xmath61 , which seems unlikely .",
    "thus , we reach the unwelcome conclusion that the polarization direction of the v=1 masers is a poor indicator of the magnetic field direction near irc2",
    ". the model calculations of @xcite show that the polarization position angle is a function of @xmath62 , and hence of the maser flux density .",
    "thus , one can understand both ( 1 ) the variations in polarization angle which occur across the maser line profile , and ( 2 ) the changes in polarization direction which occur on time scales of years as the maser intensities change . for @xmath63",
    "the models also suggest that the most intense masers will have the lowest fractional polarization , as observed .",
    "an observational result of note is the maser feature with 30% fractional polarization which appeared at v@xmath9@xmath64  in 1999 june .",
    "such high fractional polarization is difficult to achieve unless the masers are anisotropically pumped by infrared radiation from the central star @xcite .",
    "anisotropic pumping also can change the critical angle at which the polarization becomes parallel or perpendicular to the field , perhaps explaining the anomalous position angle observed for this feature .",
    "anisotropic pumping can produce strongly polarized masers even in the absence of a magnetic field @xcite ; this mechanism is thought to explain the tangential polarization pattern seen the vlba maps of sio masers around evolved stars @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the situation for the v=1 masers , the sio masers in the ground vibrational state almost certainly _ do _ fulfill the requirement that @xmath41 and @xmath37 , hence their polarization angles should be perpendicular or parallel to the magnetic field .",
    "the v=0 maser emission region is extended with respect to our synthesised beam , with peak brightness temperatures of about @xmath65  k. to compute an upper limit for the stimulated emission rate , we assume that the masers radiate isotropically , so the radiation energy density @xmath66",
    ". then @xmath67 s@xmath51 .",
    "the spontaneous radiative rate @xmath68 s@xmath51 is relatively slow , so the decay rate @xmath37 from the j=2 level is set by the sio - h@xmath69 collision rate .",
    "modeling by @xcite predicts that v=0 sio masers originate in gas with density @xmath70 @xmath50 .",
    "if the gas kinetic temperature is @xmath6300  k , the rate coefficient given by @xcite implies a collision rate of @xmath71 s@xmath51 . for a 1  mg field the zeeman frequency @xmath72 s@xmath51 . since @xmath73 , the v=0 masers should be excellent tracers of the magnetic field direction .",
    "reassuringly , the position angle of the sio v=0 polarization appears to be stable with time .",
    "the maps in figure  [ fig : f4 ] were made from data taken in 2000 december and 2001 february ; the position angle is the same , p.a .",
    "@xmath680 , in lower quality images from 1996 , 1997 , and 1999 .",
    "we note that this is close to the median position angle of the v=1 masers .",
    "one glaring discrepancy complicates the analysis : from observations made in 1994 , @xcite measured polarization position angles p.a .",
    "@xmath6150  for the  masers in the v=0 , 1 , and 2 vibrational levels . as shown in figure  [ fig : f5 ] ,",
    "these position angles differ by roughly 70  from the values we measure for the  line .",
    "given that the position angle we measured for the v=0  line was stable for 4 years , we doubt that this discrepancy can be attributed to time variability .",
    "it s also unlikely that the 39  beam used for the  measurements picked up a halo of emission polarized almost perpendicular to the core , since we find that virtually all of the polarized  flux originates in the central @xmath74 region .",
    "this leaves two possibilities : either ( 1 ) the  and  masers have intrinsically different polarizations ; or ( 2 ) the intrinsic polarizations are identical , but the observed position angles are twisted by faraday rotation .",
    "possibility ( 1 ) is hard to rule out .",
    "however , in the grid of theoretical calculations done by @xcite there appear to be no cases where the the  and  polarization position angles differ by more than 20 . and , if the  position angle we measure is parallel or perpendicular to the magnetic field , then the field is aligned neither with the bipolar outflow from irc2 ( p.a.@xmath75145 , as defined by the vlba observations of the sio masers ) , nor with the axis of the v=0 disk ( p.a .",
    "@xmath650 ) .",
    "we now explore the possibility that faraday rotation causes the discrepancy between the  and  polarization position angles .",
    "faraday rotation occurs when linearly polarized emission propagates through an ionized plasma with a magnetic field component along the line of sight .",
    "the plane of polarization is rotated by @xmath76 , where the rotation measure is given by @xmath77 rad  m@xmath4 .",
    "here @xmath78 is the electron density in @xmath50 , @xmath79 is the component of the magnetic field along the line of sight in gauss ; and @xmath80 is in parsecs . if the propagation vector is along the magnetic field direction , then the plane of polarization rotates in a clockwise direction , following the right hand rule . the minimum rotation measure which can bring the  and  position angles into agreement is @xmath81  rad  m@xmath4 , which rotates the  ( @xmath823.5 mm ) position angle by 23 , and the  ( @xmath827 mm ) position angle by 92 .    because the faraday rotation must be reasonably uniform across the @xmath63  maser emission region",
    ", we presume that it occurs in the foreground orion  a  region ( m42 ) , not in ionized gas local to irc2 ",
    "e.g. , on the surface of a circumstellar disk .",
    "what is the plausible rotation measure through orion  a ?",
    "we estimate the electron column density from the work of @xcite , who modeled the  region as a series of 9 concentric cylindrical slabs in order to fit radio continuum and recombination line data .",
    "the line of sight to irc2 passes through slabs 39 , for which the model column density @xmath83 @xmath50pc .",
    "we take the line of sight component of the magnetic field from the work of @xcite , who measured the 21 cm zeeman effect in the sheet of neutral absorbing gas in front of orion  a. the inferred field is reasonably uniform , with no reversals of direction ; the value toward irc2 is approximately @xmath84 g .",
    "the negative sign indicates that the field lines point _ toward _ us .",
    "then the rotation measure is _ positive _ , meaning that the observed position angle _ increases _ with wavelength @xcite , which is what we are hoping to find .",
    "if the magnetic field is the same inside the  region , then @xmath85 rad  m@xmath4 , within 20% of the value which brings the position angles into concordance .",
    "the estimated rotation measure is comparable with the the upper limit @xmath86  rad  m@xmath4 deduced by @xcite from the agreement of the polarization position angles for dust emission at wavelengths of 1.3  mm and 3.5  mm .",
    "we note that the majority of these dust polarization detections were made west and north of irc2 , farther from the center of the  region .",
    "suppose we accept the hypothesis that faraday rotation has twisted the  position angle by @xmath87 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : f6 ] , this means that the intrinsic polarization angle is 57 , roughly parallel with the plane of the sio `` disk , '' and perpendicular to the axis of the high velocity outflow from source  i. the inclination angle of the disk is uncertain , but the 3:1 axial ratio of both the sio and h@xmath7o maser distributions suggest that its axis is tilted by @xmath88  from the plane of the sky , that is , that the disk is seen nearly edge - on .",
    "the magnetic field can be parallel or perpendicular to the sio polarization vectors  but which is more likely ? if the maser radiation travels more or less parallel to the magnetic field , then it should be polarized parallel to the projected field direction .",
    "thus , our measurements are consistent with a magnetic field in the plane of the disk , as long as the field is oriented roughly along the line of sight .",
    "obviously , such a field can not be azimuthally symmetric ( e.g. , ring - shaped or spiral ) around irc2 .",
    "if it were , the field would become perpendicular to the line of sight in the outer parts of the bowtie , and the polarization direction would flip by 90 .    our data are more easily reconciled with a field that is everywhere perpendicular to the plane of the disk . in this case the maser radiation propagates at an angle of  70  to the field , so the polarization should be perpendicular to the field . then the field , at p.a .",
    "145 , is parallel to the axis of the high velocity outflow and to the large scale orion field mapped by far infrared observations @xcite .",
    "the infrared measurements of @xcite and @xcite give a similar magnetic field direction toward source  i , along the se edge of the irc2 infrared peak .",
    "our data provide no convincing evidence that the field has been pinched or twisted within @xmath89 au of source  i. the twist seen in the infrared data occurs on slightly larger scales .",
    "we attempted to infer the magnetic field morphology toward orion - irc2 from polarization measurements of the v=0 and v=1  sio masers associated with this star .",
    "the polarization vectors are expected to be perpendicular or parallel to the projected magnetic field direction provided that the zeeman splitting @xmath41 and @xmath37 , where @xmath1 and @xmath37 are the stimulated emission and decay rates from the maser s upper rotational level .",
    "we find that the polarization position angles of the v=1 masers vary on time scales of years .",
    "these intense masers , which originate only @xmath640 au from the star , probably are not suitable indicators of the magnetic field direction because the stimulated emission rate exceeds the zeeman splitting .",
    "typically their fractional polarization is a few percent , although in 1999 a weak feature with 30% polarization appeared .",
    "the v=0 masers are much weaker and should be good probes of the magnetic field direction .",
    "these masers originate from the star in an elongated , bowtie shaped region , possibly along the top and bottom surfaces of an underlying flared disk .",
    "maps of the v=0 emission with 0.5  ( 250  au ) angular resolution show that , contrary to our expectations : ( 1 ) the polarization vectors within @xmath6700 au of the star are straight , with no evidence of a twist or hourglass morphology ; ( 2 ) the measured polarization position angle of 80  is neither parallel nor perpendicular to the high velocity outflow from irc2 ; and ( 3 ) the  polarization position angle differs by 70  from the  position angle previously measured by @xcite .",
    "the discrepancy between the  and  position angles may be attributable to faraday rotation by plasma in the foreground orion  a  region .",
    "a rather high , but not implausible , rotation measure @xmath3  rad  m@xmath4 is required to bring the two position angles into agreement .",
    "then the intrinsic polarization direction is parallel to the plane of the disk and perpendicular to the axis of the high velocity outflow from source  i. probably the polarization vectors are perpendicular to the field in this case , so the field threads the disk poloidally , parallel to the outflow and to the large scale magnetic field in orion .",
    "the absence of a discernable pinch or twist in the field near irc2 may indicate that as the molecular cloud collapsed the gas density in the pseudodisk exceeded @xmath90  @xmath50 , at which point the magnetic field decouples from the infalling gas @xcite .",
    "alternatively , the outflow or subsequent evolution of the disk has erased all traces of the pinched field .",
    "the high fractional polarizations observed for the v=0 masers  up to 50% in our  data and up to 80% in the  observations of @xcite  suggest that anisotropic excitation by infrared photons play an essential role in pumping these masers .",

    "<S> in an attempt to probe the magnetic field morphology near the massive young star orion - irc2 , we mapped the linear polarization of its sio masers , in both the v=0 and v=1 vibrational levels , with @xmath0 resolution . </S>",
    "<S> the intense v=1 masers are confined to a narrow zone 40  au from the star . </S>",
    "<S> their polarization position angles vary significantly on time scales of years . for the v=1 masers </S>",
    "<S> the stimulated emission rate @xmath1 is likely to exceed the zeeman splitting @xmath2 due to any plausible magnetic field ; in this case the maser polarization need not correlate with the field direction . </S>",
    "<S> the much weaker v=0 masers in the ground vibrational level lie from irc2 , in what appears to be a flared disk . </S>",
    "<S> their fractional polarizations are as high as 50% . </S>",
    "<S> the polarization position angles vary little across the line profile or the emission region , and appear to be stable in time . the position angle , p.a . </S>",
    "<S> = 80 , we measure for the  masers differs by 70  from that measured for the  sio transition , possibly because of faraday rotation in the foreground , orion  a ,  region . </S>",
    "<S> a rotation measure @xmath3 rad  m@xmath4 is required to bring the  and  position angles into concordance . </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic polarization position angle for both transitions is then 57 , parallel to the plane of the putative disk . </S>",
    "<S> probably the magnetic field threads the disk poloidally . </S>",
    "<S> there is little evidence for a pinched or twisted field near the star . </S>"
