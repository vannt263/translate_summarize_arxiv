    "with the advent of space - based telescopes , such as the hubble space telescope ( hst ) , and large aperture ground - based telescopes with adaptive optics ( ao ) , such as gemini and vlt , the number of galaxies beyond the milky way ( mw ) and its dwarf companions for which detailed studies can be made is gradually increasing .",
    "of the nearby galaxies , m33 ( ngc 598 , the triangulum nebula ) is one of the best for studying the stellar content of spiral galaxies .",
    "outside of the mw , it is one of the closest and brightest spirals visible , surpassed only by m31 .",
    "m31 is more luminous and slightly closer , but it s higher inclination angle of 77  ( compared to 56  for m33 ) makes it more difficult to separate the contributions from different stellar populations .",
    "however , is m33 the prototype or the exception when it comes to late - type spiral galaxies ? it contains a healthy population of halo globular clusters @xcite , yet it is not certain whether there is a matching bulge .",
    "this simple point is crucial for understanding the role of a bulge in galaxy formation , and its relationship to the halo and globular clusters .    as of 1991",
    ", the status of m33 s bulge was `` controversial '' according to a review of literature by @xcite .",
    "there have since been many papers on m33 , but the number of authors who find a bulge seems balanced by an equal number who do not .",
    "@xcite argued against a traditional bulge , based on the lack of a power - law contribution to his 12  surface brightness measurements .",
    "although his @xmath7-band observations do show an excess of light inside @xmath8 , he finds no satisfactory @xmath9 fit .",
    "based on infrared ( ir ) observations of the central @xmath10 which show a clustering of stars around the nucleus , @xcite take the opposite side .",
    "they find a de vaucouleurs profile fits all but the inner @xmath11 of their surface photometry .",
    "@xcite are also in favor of a bulge in m33",
    ". their infrared surface brightness measurements of the central @xmath12 seem reasonably well fit by an exponential disk plus @xmath9 profile .",
    "in contrast , @xcite cite an unchanging ir luminosity function from @xmath13 to @xmath14 as evidence against a significant bulge population beyond @xmath13 .",
    "thus , a decade after van den bergh s review , the controversy remains unresolved .",
    "in this paper we use ir gemini - north observations with quirc / hokupaa to study the stellar populations in the inner regions of m33 . in section",
    "[ sec : observations ] we describe our observations and observing procedure .",
    "section [ sec : data_reduction ] details the data reduction , photometric techniques , and calibration .",
    "we give the azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile in section [ sec : decomposition ] and , after combining our observations with those of @xcite , present simple two- and three- component model decompositions .",
    "we describe artificial star tests performed to understand completeness and observational effects as a function of a star s position and luminosity in section [ sec : artstartests ] .",
    "we use the color - magnitude - diagram ( cmd ) to estimate the metallicities and ages of the stars in our field in section [ sec : cmds ] .",
    "we present the stellar luminosity function ( lf ) in section [ sec : lfs ] , and compare it to the lf measured in the galactic bulge . in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare our observations to the recent work in the infrared by @xcite with the cfht ao system , and combine our data with optical hst - wfpc2 measurements made by @xcite .",
    "we look for radial variations in the stellar properties in section [ sec : radial_variations ] . in section [ sec : blending ]",
    "we perform a theoretical analysis of blending on our own and previous observations following the procedures of @xcite .",
    "finally we give a summary of our conclusions in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the observations upon which this paper is based were taken as part of the gemini north quickstart service observing program using hokupaa & quirc .",
    "@xcite is a natural guide star , 36-element curvature - sensing adaptive optics system built by the university of hawaii .",
    "quirc is a near - infrared imager on loan from the university of hawaii and mounted at the exit focus of hokupaa .",
    "quirc has a @xmath15 hawaii hgcdte array with a plate scale of @xmath16 pixel@xmath17 , giving a @xmath18 field of view .",
    "the array is linear to @xmath19 adu , and saturates at @xmath20 adu , with a gain of 1.85 @xmath21/adu .",
    "we observed the central regions of m33 ( @xmath2201:33:50.9 , @xmath2330:39:37 , j2000 ) through three filters , @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 @xcite .",
    "we used the nucleus of m33 as the ao wavefront reference source .",
    "observations were carried out over three separate nights spanning three months .",
    "table [ tab : observations ] lists the number of successful frames which were obtained in each band on each night .",
    "exposure times were 180 seconds except on october 25 when observations were made without a shutter ; on that night the exposure times were approximately 10.8 seconds longer due to the detector readout time .",
    "the relative size , location , and orientation of our field is illustrated in figure [ fig : field_locator ] .",
    "on the left of this figure is a @xmath27 digitized sky survey image centered on m33 .",
    "the box drawn in the center of the galaxy represents the placement of our infrared gemini - north image .",
    "the infrared image shown on the right is our combined @xmath25-band image , and is @xmath28 across .",
    "we obtained sky observations for background subtraction in a blank field @xmath29 se of the nucleus ( @xmath2201:34:57 , @xmath2329:57:20 , j2000 ) .",
    "the typical observing pattern was to take two sky dithers , four dithers on the nucleus , two skys , etc . with this technique the sky frame",
    "is constructed from the combination of the pairs of sky frames before and after each observation , and hence each two - dither sky set is used for both the preceding and following galaxy observations .",
    "the sky sets used @xmath30 dithers , while the galaxy sets used @xmath31 dithers .",
    "ukirt photometric standard stars were observed each night , although possibly not quite as frequently as the authors would have liked .",
    "the september night had one standard before and one after our observations ; the october night had two before ; and the december night had two before and one after .",
    "these standards were typically observed with 5 second exposure times , implementing a five position dither pattern moving the star in @xmath32 steps .",
    "cccc 2000 - 09 - 27 & 8 & 0 & 12 + 2000 - 10 - 25 & 8 & 0 & 8 + 2000 - 12 - 22 & 0 & 19 & 0 + [ tab : observations ]    image quality was extremely good .",
    "we used the iraf gemseeing procedure to estimate the full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) on all 55 images .",
    "the results shown in figure [ fig : fwhm ] are the average fwhms measured on the same @xmath33 hand - selected stars on all frames .",
    "the @xmath26-band images have a mean seeing of @xmath34 , @xmath25-band obtained @xmath35 , while the @xmath24-band images are slightly worse and more variable with a mean seeing of @xmath36 .",
    "the superior image quality at longer wavelengths is a consequence of the increased coherence length of the atmosphere ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "the image size does not vary significantly across the field , although the psf morphology has a systematic dependence on the azimuthal angle around the nucleus of m33 , which was used as the ao reference . for comparison ,",
    "the diffraction limits of an 8 m telescope are @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40 at @xmath24,@xmath25 , and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "the fwhm , however , is not the best measurement of image quality since most ao images consist of a tight core superimposed on much broader emission .",
    "we therefore also recorded the gemseeing task s estimates of various encircled energy diameters ( eed ) .",
    "we found that the 50% eed is approximately twice the fwhm , while the average 95% eeds are @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 respectively .",
    "we reduced our data using the gemini package of tools in iraf .",
    "the procedure involves division by a normalized lamps on  lamps off dome flat field , and subtraction of a sky frame constructed from sky observations before and after each galaxy observation .",
    "a constant equal to the median of the sky frame was then added back to the image to restore the original sky level and maintain the noise characteristics of the frame .",
    "photometry was performed with peter stetson s suite of software .",
    "object detection was done on a combined image made up of all the dithers of all the bands .",
    "we then used daophot @xcite to determine point spread functions ( psfs ) for each dither of each band using isolated stars .",
    "we used a quadratically variable model psf with a 25 pixel ( @xmath44 ) radius ; an alternate run using a larger 50 pixel ( @xmath45 ) radius psf , yielded little difference in the photometry , while taking a significantly larger amount of processing time .",
    "instrumental magnitudes were measured using the allframe psf fitting routine @xcite which simultaneously fits psfs to all stars on all dithers .",
    "daogrow @xcite was then used to determine the best magnitude in a @xmath44 radius aperture .",
    "our first attempt at calibrating the data used the photometric standards which were observed for us .",
    "we measured each standard using simple aperture photometry with a @xmath44 radius aperture , and a sky annulus from @xmath46 to @xmath47 . due to the small number of observed standards",
    ", we combined the measurements from all three nights .",
    "this gave us three @xmath24 standards and four @xmath26 standards for the september and october nights , and three @xmath25 standards for the december night .",
    "unfortunately , there are no published @xmath26 measurements for ukirt standards .",
    "we therefore estimated @xmath26 for each of the observed standards using the ( @xmath48 ) color and the transformation of @xcite . using the median combination of these measurements",
    ", we estimated our photometric zero point with uncertainties of 0.02 magnitudes in @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and 0.04 magnitudes in @xmath24 .",
    "we then converted our science @xmath26 measurements to @xmath49 based on each star s @xmath50 color using a transformation derived from the data published by @xcite .",
    "the last step was to convert our measurements to the cit / ctio photometric system using the transformation equations of @xcite .",
    "this initial calibration seemed to work acceptably for the @xmath24 and @xmath25 bands , but _ not _ for @xmath49 .",
    "evidence of the failure was in the disagreement ( @xmath51 magnitudes ) with previously published data for the stars in the inner region of m33 .",
    "specifically , with the @xmath49-band measurements of bright stars measured by @xcite , and an equal offset in the @xmath49-band surface brightness measurements published by @xcite .",
    "one possible cause of the problem is an inadequate transformation between @xmath49 and @xmath26 .",
    "the @xcite transformation was published in a paper describing the original @xmath26 filter .",
    "yet even a cursory comparison of the @xmath26 filter transmission curve published for quirc and that in the @xcite article reveals that they are very different . as an example , the original filter had a peak transmission of @xmath52% , while the quirc @xmath26 filter peaks over 95% .    to overcome this problem we had to find alternate `` standards '' , preferably ones which had been observed before .",
    "for this purpose , we matched observations of 31 stars in common with the photometry published by @xcite .",
    "we examined the difference between his @xmath49 band observations ( ukirt photometric system ) and our instrumental @xmath26 for any dependence on @xmath53 or @xmath54 color , but found no significant trend .",
    "we therefore adopted the mean difference as our photometric zero point and conversion to the @xmath49-band .",
    "the uncertainty in this zero point is 0.02 magnitudes .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the comparison between these two datasets can be found in section [ sec : davidge ] .    with the measurements",
    "finally calibrated we could construct our final photometry list . since our transformation to the cit / ctio system requires both @xmath53 and @xmath54 color information , we had already selected out only stars which have measurements in all three bands .",
    "in addition , each star had to have been detected on at least five dithers in each band , and the final error had to be less than 0.25 magnitudes .",
    "this gave us a list of 3716 objects over the entire frame .",
    "after ignoring objects detected within @xmath47 of the center of m33 because of severe crowding and incompleteness ( see section [ sec : completeness ] ) , we were left with a final photometry list of 3308 measurements , covering an area of 416 square arcseconds .    when converting to absolute or bolometric magnitudes , we will use the distance and reddening to m33 as determined by @xcite from observations of cepheid variables .",
    "they find a true distance modulus of @xmath55 ( 850 kpc , @xmath56 pc ) , assuming 18.5 for the lmc .",
    "they also measure the m33 reddening to be @xmath57 , assuming 0.1 for the lmc , and a ratio of total - to - selective extinction of @xmath58 .",
    "these values translate to an infrared extinction and reddening of @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "we note , however , that @xcite have recently calculated a slightly farther distance of 930 kpc , @xmath61 , using rr lyrae s in two halo clusters .",
    "in order to obtain accurate surface brightness measurements , we started with our reduced frames , and subtracted off the constant sky value which had been added previously to maintain each frame s noise characteristics .",
    "we then converted each frame to count rates , since some of the frames had slightly different exposure times .",
    "the resulting set of images in each band were averaged together to create the final images .",
    "we used the xvista annulus routine to compute azimuthally averaged radial surface brightness profiles . assuming an inclination of 56@xcite and a position angle of 23  for m33 , the routine defines elliptical annuli to be used as the averaging paths , in effect calculating the deprojected surface brightness profile assuming a circular disk . with 2 pixel wide annuli ( @xmath38 )",
    ", we were able to calculate the surface brightness profile out to @xmath62 .",
    "we then combined our surface brightness measurements with those of @xcite which span from @xmath63 to @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting @xmath49-band profile is shown in figure [ fig : decomposition ] .",
    "there are three @xcite points in the region of overlap ( @xmath64 ) , and in this region the average difference between the two datasets is less than 0.01 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath65 .",
    "note that since the surface brightness information is extracted directly from pixel values , the profile is unaffected by image blending , even in the most crowded regions .    using this combined surface brightness profile ( @xmath66 )",
    ", we have performed a simple bulge / disk decomposition .",
    "we assume an exponential disk ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : disk ] ) with a central intensity @xmath67 and a disk scale length @xmath68 , and a de vaucouleurs @xmath9 bulge ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : bulge ] ) with an effective radius @xmath69 and an intensity @xmath70 at @xmath69 .",
    "the factor @xmath71 is a correction factor for deprojecting a spherical bulge .",
    "the best fitting 2-component model is illustrated in the left panel of figure [ fig : decomposition ] with a solid line .",
    "the disk has a central surface brightness of 17.16 magnitudes arcsec@xmath65 , and a scale length @xmath72 .",
    "the bulge is very compact , with an effective radius @xmath73 , where the surface brightness is 13.87 mag arcsec@xmath65 .",
    "the results of the fit are not very encouraging for this oversimplistic disk + bulge model .",
    "it is very clear that m33 has a strong compact spheroid component which becomes dominant over the disk at @xmath74 .",
    "however , the best fit parameters are neither a good fit to the inner bulge , nor to the disk between @xmath75 .    @xmath76    @xmath77 \\ } \\label{eqn : bulge}\\ ] ]    @xmath78 \\ }",
    "\\label{eqn : core}\\ ] ]    a simple alternative is to add a third component to our model .",
    "we thus try an exponential disk + @xmath9 spheroid + sersic core @xcite . the sersic function ( eqn .",
    "[ eqn : core ] ) is parameterized with an effective radius @xmath79 , an intensity @xmath80 at @xmath79 , and the shape index @xmath81 ( @xmath82 ) . the variable power - law index @xmath81 gives the sersic function an extra degree of freedom over the more constrained exponential or @xmath9 profiles .",
    "the results of this three component model are shown on the right side of figure [ fig : decomposition ] and the parameter values are listed in table [ tab : decomposition ] . not surprisingly , this yields a significantly better fit than for the two component model .",
    "the central peak in surface brightness is well described by the sersic function , the disk is @xmath3 magnitude fainter , and the spheroid explains the excess luminosity seen inside @xmath11 .",
    "note that we list only the parameters derived from the @xmath25- and @xmath49-band images .",
    "the @xmath24-band image quality was inadequate to accurately model the very narrow core component .",
    "lcc disk scale length , @xmath68 & @xmath83 & @xmath84 + disk central sb , @xmath67 & 18.13 & 17.75 + spheroid effective radius , @xmath69 & @xmath85 & @xmath86 + spheroid sb @ @xmath69 , @xmath70 & 24.08 & 23.40 + core effective radius , @xmath79 & @xmath87 & @xmath88 + core sb @ @xmath79 , @xmath80 & 13.03 & 12.73 + core shape index , @xmath81 & 2.21 & 2.07 + [ tab : decomposition ]    these disk and spheroid parameters are similar to those derived by @xcite based on their @xmath89 data alone . they found a disk scale length of @xmath90 at @xmath25 and @xmath91 at @xmath49 , with a central surface brightnesses of @xmath92 and @xmath93 mag / arcsec@xmath94 .",
    "however , since they were only using a two - component model ( and excluding the inner @xmath95 ) , they derived a brighter , more compact spheroid with @xmath96 , @xmath97 , and @xmath98 magnitudes arcsecond@xmath65 .",
    "their more compact spheroid is also in agreement with the @xmath99 spheroid effective radius found by @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied the surface brightness profile of m33 in the visible , and found a larger exponential disk scale length of @xmath100 .",
    "he also realized that the profile was too high for just an exponential disk inside @xmath8 , but he dismissed it due to the presence of visible spiral structure , concluding that the disk is non - exponential in the center .",
    "if our three component model is taken literally , it implies that virtually our entire field is spheroid dominated . at @xmath101",
    "the spheroid and central core have equal surface brightness , which is 0.7 magnitudes brighter than that of the disk . at the edges of our field ,",
    "@xmath102 , the disk and spheroid surface brightness become nearly equal .",
    "if this is correct , and the spheroid and disk are composed of different stellar populations , we may be able to detect a very small change in the composite population as a function of radius ( see section [ sec : radial_variations ] ) .",
    "we have also estimated the size of the core from our combined @xmath26 image .",
    "this image has better image quality than the @xmath24 band , and is not saturated like the @xmath25 images . on this image",
    "the nucleus has a fwhm of @xmath103 , compared to the stars which have a width of @xmath104 .",
    "thus we estimate that the nucleus has a width in @xmath26 of less than @xmath105 .",
    "we give this value as an upper limit since we do not attempt to correct for the nonlinearity of the array in the very core ( @xmath106 ) where the count rate is too high for the exposure time .",
    "this value seems in line with the increasing core size with wavelength measured by @xcite using hst .",
    "they find a core fwhm of @xmath107 with the f300w filter , @xmath108 with the f555w filter , and @xmath109 with the f1042 filter .",
    "although we could not measure the nuclear luminosity because the central pixels of our images were saturated , we can make an estimate based on our surface brightness fits .",
    "integrating the `` core '' component from the best - fitting three component model , we find a total luminosity of @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "assuming @xmath112 , this corresponds to @xmath113 .",
    "in order to understand the completeness of our observations and estimate the importance of blending , we have performed a series of tests using artificial data .",
    "the traditional completeness tests inject artificial stars into the observed frames ; the efficiency and accuracy of their recovery give information about the completeness of the observations @xcite .",
    "this method is straightforward and easy to use , but is limited to primarily uncrowded fields .",
    "the more complex artificial field technique creates an entire frame containing millions of artificial stars to match the observations @xcite .",
    "this method is especially useful in very crowded fields , providing important constraints on the underlying stellar population .",
    "however , since photometry of the entire set of 55 @xmath114 pixel frames can be quite time consuming , taking many days to complete , our artificial star tests were instead run on the final combined @xmath115 images . to validate this shortcut ,",
    "we have compared photometry obtained from the combined images with that from the simultaneous measurements of the 55 individual dithers .",
    "tests show that these two techniques are nearly identical , except for the faintest stars , where the photometry performed on the individual frames tends to be more complete .",
    "this can be seen in figure [ fig : dither_vs_combined_lfs ] , which shows luminosity functions derived from each of the two methods .",
    "the lf obtained from the individual frame photometry ( solid line ) rolls over approximately one magnitude fainter than the lf from the combined frames ( beaded line ) , even though they both go to about the same depth .      starting with the three ( @xmath116 ) final combined images",
    ", we used the daophot addstar routine @xcite to insert 361 artificial stars into each image .",
    "these stars were arranged in a grid of @xmath117 , with a spacing of @xmath118 pixels ( @xmath119 ) , to avoid self - crowding .",
    "each star included random poisson noise , and random sub - pixel coordinate offsets from the aforementioned grid .",
    "all stars were input with the same magnitude starting with @xmath120 , and a color based on the mean colors observed in the real frame .",
    "we then repeated this process , with the grid of input stars shifted by 26 pixels ( @xmath121 ) .",
    "after four trials we had added a total of 1444 artificial stars , each sampling different positions in our frame .",
    "after the addition of the artificial stars , we analyzed these frames in the same manner as our original frames .",
    "stars were detected with daofind and measured on each of the four sets of @xmath116 images simultaneously with allframe .",
    "once the final photometry list was completed , we extracted the colors and magnitudes recovered for the input artificial stars using daomaster to match recovered coordinates with input coordinates , requiring less than a 2 pixel ( @xmath38 ) difference in position .",
    "we repeated this 4-trial procedure for six different integer input magnitudes ( @xmath122 ) .",
    "we have thus accumulated statistics on a total of 8664 artificial stars .",
    "figure [ fig : deltamag ] shows the difference between the recovered and input magnitudes as a function of distance from the center of m33 for three of the six input magnitudes ( @xmath123 ) . as expected the brightest stars are recovered very accurately , with only a few outliers caused by blends with other bright stars on the frame .",
    "note that an artificial star has to fall almost exactly on top of another star to be brightened but not lost since its position can not be perturbed by more than @xmath38 to be considered the same input star .",
    "near the center of m33 ( @xmath124 ) , where the density of stars is very high , figure [ fig : deltamag ] shows that almost all of the artificial stars are measured significantly brighter than their input magnitude .",
    "since the surface brightness varies across the field , our photometric completeness will also be a function of position on the frame . in figure",
    "[ fig : comp_vs_rad ] we plot the completeness as a function of radius for three of the six input magnitudes . to estimate the completeness , we have counted up the number of recovered stars in radial bins around the center of m33 , requiring that the difference between input and recovered magnitudes be less than 0.25 .",
    "we then divide by the number of artificial stars input into these same bins .",
    "the results are averaged over the four trials , and the errorbars show the one sigma dispersion in the range of values obtained over the four trials .",
    "this plot shows several important things about the completeness across our frame .",
    "first , the completeness drops off very quickly near the center of m33 . the completeness of the brighter stars drops from almost 100% to near zero across a range of only @xmath45 .",
    "the fainter stars do not exhibit quite as precipitous a drop , but still make the transition from maximum to minimum values quite quickly ; albeit at a larger central distance .",
    "second , the completeness away from the nucleus is relatively constant .",
    "thus it is safe to simply throw away measurements inside some critical radius , where the completeness is low ( and the effects of blending are high ) , and afterwards not worry about spatially varying completeness .",
    "finally , we can measure no stars accurately inside @xmath45 . while some stars are recovered in this region ( see figure [ fig : deltamag ] )",
    "their measured brightnesses are all discrepant by more than 0.25 magnitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : comp_vs_mag ] shows the photometric completeness as a function of the brightness of the input artificial stars . here",
    "again we require that the recovered magnitude be no more than 0.25 magnitudes different than the input magnitude .",
    "since figure [ fig : comp_vs_rad ] shows that the negative effects of the core of m33 are constrained to the inner @xmath125 , we split this figure into two components .",
    "the solid line shows the completeness measured for all stars outside @xmath47 , which are again lower limits on the completeness since measured on the combined frames , while the science photometry was performed on all 55 individual frames simultaneously .",
    "the dashed line is for all objects measured closer than @xmath47 to the center of m33 , and shows that the photometry inside @xmath47 is severely degraded at all magnitudes .",
    "we have created a completely artificial field to match our m33 observations .",
    "we processed and measured this field in exactly the same manner as the real observations .",
    "since we know both the measured and true magnitude and color of every star in the artificial field , we can quantify our errors and try to estimate the true properties of the observed stellar population being modeled , free from observational effects .    starting with blank frames with the appropriate amount of poisson noise",
    ", we add 8 million stars using spatially variable psfs modeled from the real data .",
    "the stars follow the observed m33 radial distribution , specifically the sum of the three component @xmath49-band decomposition of  [ sec : decomposition ] .",
    "the input stellar population is chosen to match the colors and luminosity function observed in our m33 field .",
    "the input colors are the mean colors observed for stars with @xmath126 , and calculated at 0.5 magnitude intervals .",
    "the input luminosity function follows a power law distribution with a slope @xmath127 ( as is measured in ",
    "[ sec : lfs ] ) , extending from @xmath128 .",
    "we add stars until the recovered lf of the simulation approximately matches the recovered lf of the real observations . in this case",
    "we added 8 million stars , which gives us slightly fewer recovered stars than in the real frame , 2677 artificial vs 2802 real , however as figure [ fig : simlfs ] shows , we get a very good match over most of the range of luminosities .",
    "the artificial frames were then processed and measured in the same manner as the real data , namely finding stars on a combined image with daofind , modeling the psf from isolated stars , and simultaneous psf - fitting photometry with allframe .",
    "the resulting @xmath129,@xmath53 and @xmath129,@xmath130 cmds are shown in figure [ fig : simcmd ] .",
    "here we have included all objects measured on the frame to show how well the simulation reproduces the observations , including blended objects located within @xmath131 ( half - size points ) .",

    "the cmd of our m33 field is shown in figure [ fig : cmd ] . here",
    "we have omitted objects measured within @xmath47 of the nucleus which are mostly blends of fainter , bluer stars as indicated by their characteristic blueward and upward shift from the main giant branch locus ( see figure [ fig : simcmd ] ) .",
    "we have shown in section [ sec : completeness ] that nearly all objects detected close to the nucleus are blended , and that @xmath47 is approximately the boundary outside of which accurate photometry can be achieved .",
    "we thus take @xmath47 as the dividing radius between `` good '' and `` bad '' photometry .",
    "the resulting cmd for @xmath126 is relatively clean ; we interpret the gap at @xmath132 as the tip of the red giant branch ( rgb ) , and stars extending to @xmath133 as the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) .",
    "we compare our cmd with measurements by others in section [ sec : comparison ] .",
    "the slope of the rgb is very sensitive to the metallicity of the population . @xcite and",
    "@xcite have used this fact to develop a metallicity indicator using the slope @xmath134 of the infrared rgbs of the upper five magnitudes ( @xmath135 ) of galactic globular clusters .",

    "we find a slope of @xmath140 , which implies a mean metallicity of [ fe / h]@xmath141 .",
    "this is our estimate for the average stellar population in the central regions of m33 ( @xmath142 ) .",
    "this determination is in agreement with the estimate of [ fe / h]@xmath143 by @xcite using population spectral synthesis of the central @xmath144 of m33 .",
    "however , as we will show in the next section , there is clearly a young stellar component present in the region imaged . since the gb slope is also sensitive to age @xcite , in the sense that at a constant metallicity the slope increases ( gets less negative ) with decreasing age",
    ". thus if all the stars ( old and young ) have the same metallicity , the gb slope will be slightly more positive than for a purely old population , and the kuchinski relation will give a metallicity which is too low .",
    "however , the younger stars are probably more metal rich than the mean of the old population , and hence their gb slope will be closer to that of the older , metal - poor population than if they were of the same metallicity . in short ,",
    "our metallicity estimate is dependent on both the metallicities and ages of all the stars in the population .      to estimate the age of the youngest stars in our field",
    ", we convert our ( cit / ctio ) @xmath49-band measurements to bolometric luminosities using the corrections of @xcite .",
    "these corrections were derived for m - giants in baade s window and depend on the dereddened @xmath145 color .",
    "the resulting bolometric cmd is shown in figure [ fig : cmd_mbol ] .",
    "assuming that the few bright stars at the tip of the agb are members of a young population , we can estimate the age of this population using the relationship between agb tip luminosity and age .",
    "first used by @xcite , this relation makes use of the monotonically decreasing maximum luminosity of the agb tip with increasing age .",
    "due to the limited number of stars in our field , and the short lifetime of stars on the agb , this estimate is only an upper limit to the age of the youngest stars .",
    "@xcite have recalculated the relation between the agb tip luminosity and age using the zvar synthetic cmd code of @xcite .",
    "this program makes use of the stellar evolution models of @xcite , and the mass - loss prescription of @xcite . averaging three different models with different metallicities and binary fractions , they derived equation [ eqn : age ] for the ages of stars on the agb tip at different luminosities .",
    "thus by measuring the bolometric luminosity of the agb tip , one can estimate the age of the youngest stars in the field .",
    "@xmath146    the simplest estimate of the age comes from the luminosity of the brightest star in the field .",
    "this star has @xmath147 , which , with equation [ eqn : age ] , gives an age of 0.51 gyr .",
    "if we assume that the intermediate age stars on the agb can be explained by a single burst of star formation , we can apply the averaging technique of @xcite to overcome small number statistics when estimating the tip of the agb .",
    "their method is to find the average luminosity of stars on the agb over the agb tip of an old population ( @xmath148 ) . by assuming",
    "that the distribution of stars along the agb is uniform , the peak bolometric luminosity for a fully populated agb should be twice the mean ( plus @xmath149 ) . using this procedure on the 28 stars brighter than @xmath150 we estimate the agb tip luminosity to be @xmath151 for a fully populated agb .",
    "this luminosity implies an age of @xmath152 gyr for this intermediate age population .",
    "however , looking at the bolometric cmd in figure [ fig : cmd_mbol ] , it is fairly clear that the stars above @xmath153 are not uniformly populated along its entire extent .",
    "this is probably due to multiple bursts of star formation contributing to the agb .",
    "a careful inspection shows that the agb is well represented from @xmath154 , with a bright tail of stars up to @xmath155 ( see also the luminosity function in figure [ fig : lf_mbol ] ) .",
    "the predominant agb is most likely due to a large burst of star formation around 2 gyr ago , while the less populated secondary agb is probably due to an even more recent burst of star formation @xmath3 gyr ago .",
    "a similar multi - generation model was proposed for the nucleus of m33 by @xcite to explain its blue ( @xmath156 ) and red ( @xmath157 ) colors and strong spectral absorption features such as h@xmath158 and h@xmath159 .",
    "@xcite also argued for multiple epochs of star formation based on the integrated optical spectrum of the inner @xmath32 , and concluded that @xmath33% of the @xmath160-band light originates in stars younger than 1 gyr , with the youngest generation about @xmath161 years old .",
    "ultraviolet observations agree , @xcite used iue spectra together with @xmath162 photometry of the nucleus to model the stellar population , and found the best - fit model required both a young component with an age of @xmath163 years , and an old component with an age of @xmath164 years . while combining photometric and spectroscopic observations , @xcite found that the nucleus of m33 is best fit by a @xmath165 myr old single burst of star formation enshrouded by a significant amount of dust .",
    "most recently , @xcite used stellar spectral synthesis to model hst stis spectroscopy of the nucleus and found that the best fit is with two bursts of star formation 50 myr and 1 gyr ago .",

    "first we perform the ks - test on the radial positions of stars plotted in the optical - ir cmd ( figure [ fig : cmd_vk ] ) . here",
    "we have divided the stars into two groups : blueward of the intermediate age magellanic cloud cluster locus , which we call `` young '' , and redward of the mc cluster locus , which we call `` old '' . for both groups",
    "we consider stars only brighter than @xmath232 to minimize the effects of incompleteness .",
    "when considering all stars from @xmath47 to @xmath233 , the ks - test shows a marginal difference ( @xmath234 ) between the radial distribution of the `` young '' and `` old '' stars , however this difference arises in the very central regions , and is most likely due to incompleteness in this more crowded region . when we limit the test to stars outside @xmath235 , the radial distributions of the two groups become nearly indistinguishable ( @xmath236 ) .",
    "thus based on the stars from @xmath235 to @xmath233 in the optical - ir cmd , we would conclude that the radial distributions of `` young '' and `` old '' stars are identical .",
    "if instead , we consider our whole sample of infrared measurements , and are more selective in our choice of `` young '' stars , namely bluer than @xmath237 and brighter than @xmath238 , these stars appear to lie at larger radii than the remainder of the population . performing a ks - test on this small subsection of the cmd , from @xmath235 to @xmath233 ,",

    "if the ks - test is run from @xmath235 to @xmath32 the significance completely disappears .",
    "we mention this result as an aside because it is only evident in the outermost regions of the field , where the completeness due to dithering is difficult to calculate and the probability for systematic effects caused by the large distance from the wavefront reference source ( nucleus ) is highest .",

    "specifically they found that the younger pop i stars preferentially lie farther from the nucleus than the more centrally concentrated older pop ii stars .",
    "next we look at the luminosity functions measured in each of the four rings defined in table [ tab : radial_variations ] and illustrated in figure [ fig : stellar_dist ] .",
    "we fit a power - law to the rgb from @xmath242 and find that there is no significant change across the field , and that the slopes determined are all consistent with that measured for the entire field : @xmath243 . a more rigorous analysis using the ks - test verifies this general result .",
    "these tests show that based on the distribution of stellar luminosities in each of the four annuli , as well as on the radial distribution of stars of different luminosities ( binned into 1-magnitude bins ) , all stars are consistent with being drawn from the same population .",

    "the radial limits of each are at the top of each cmd , and the number of objects found in each ring is printed in the bottom right corner . using the same technique which we used to estimate the mean metallicity of the stellar population in section [ sec : cmds ] , we now measure the slope of the gb in each ring .",
    "as before , the iterative linear fit is only to data with @xmath246 , and ignores three sigma outliers .",
    "the results of the gb fitting are listed in column 4 of table [ tab : radial_variations ] .",
    "we find that based on the slope of the giant branch , the mean metallicity of each annulus is consistent with that of the entire field .",
    "this is similar to what has been observed in the inner bulge of our milky way ( @xmath247 pc ) , which shows no evidence for a gradient along the major or minor axes @xcite .",
    "although we have not detected a gradient in the stellar properties in the inner @xmath248 , we have nonetheless helped fill in the gap between the metallicity gradient observed in the disk of m33 @xcite , and low abundance measurements for the nuclear region , most recently [ fe / h]@xmath249 ( @xmath250 ) based on the co index by @xcite .",
    "as @xcite has pointed out , meaningful photometry can only be obtained for stars brighter than the luminosity contained in each resolution element .",
    "we have calculated the enclosed luminosity in m33 for five different imaging resolutions ( @xmath104 , @xmath192 , @xmath251 , @xmath252 , and @xmath47 ) , assuming that the size of the resolution element is defined by the fwhm .",
    "figure [ fig : blendinglimits ] shows the corresponding limiting @xmath49-band magnitude as a function of surface brightness .",

    "even more useful perhaps , is a plot of the limiting magnitude due to blending as a function of spatial position . for symmetric surface brightness distributions , such as exist around m33 ,",
    "the conversion is relatively simple . using our three component surface brightness model ( section [ sec : decomposition ] ) ,",
    "we have transformed from generic surface brightness to the radial distance from the center of m33 measured in arcminutes .",
    "the resulting relations for the same five different resolutions are shown on the right side of figure [ fig : blendinglimits ] .",
    "thus for our data , with a resolution of @xmath256 , the faintest stars which we can accurately measure ( against blending ) at @xmath95 arcseconds from the center of m33 have @xmath257 .",
    "if we try to measure stars at a distance of @xmath47 , blending will limit our measurements to only stars brighter than @xmath258 , a full magnitude brighter than we could accurately measure at @xmath95 .",
    "another simple calculation advocated by @xcite is the estimation of the number of stars in each evolutionary stage per resolution element .",
    "this allows one to estimate the severity of blending in any observation .",
    "this calculation has several parameters which have a weak dependence on the age , metallicity , and imf of the stellar population .",
    "the ratio of total ( @xmath259 ) to @xmath49-band luminosity ( @xmath260 ) , and the specific evolutionary flux , @xmath261 , are two such parameters . for our calculation",

    "the results of this calculation for stars within one magnitude of the rgb tip ( rgbt ) are displayed in figure [ fig : nrgbt_reselement ] . in the left panel",
    "we show the number of rgbt stars per resolution element as a function of surface brightness for five different imaging resolutions .",
    "the number of blends of two rgbt stars on a frame can be estimated as the square of the number per resolution element ( for @xmath265 ) multiplied by the number of resolution elements in the frame @xcite .",
    "if the number of rgbt stars per resolution element is greater than one , it should be clear that photometry of stars at or below the level of the rgbt is impossible . at this point only stars several magnitudes brighter than the rgbt can be measured with any accuracy , but then one must face the question of whether the objects measured are real or just blends of many stars , each of which can be as bright as the tip of the rgb .",
    "@xcite have performed simulations of the blending in their nicmos observations of globular clusters in m31 .",
    "they show that severe blending can easily create objects which are several magnitudes brighter than any star in the parent population . thus one must be very careful when interpreting bright objects measured in a very crowded fields , i.e. where n(rgbt ) per resolution element is greater than one .",
    "it might be illuminating to examine a few previous studies of the central regions of m33 keeping figures [ fig : blendinglimits ] and [ fig : nrgbt_reselement ] in mind .",
    "the most critical , at least in terms of our photometric calibration , are the observations of @xcite discussed in section [ sec : data_reduction ] .",
    "plotting his @xmath192 resolution on both figures , we see that his observations are not significantly affected by blending .",
    "the right side of figure [ fig : nrgbt_reselement ] shows that davidge stays below 1 rgbt star per resolution element until only @xmath46 from the nucleus , which he ( for the most part ) steers clear of .",
    "assuming the average distance of his field from the nucleus is @xmath266 , figure [ fig : blendinglimits ] shows that the limit of accurate photometry ( against blending ) is @xmath267 . since",
    "his estimated completeness limit is @xmath268 , his photometry is therefore limited by photon noise and not blending .",
    "checking the observations of @xcite , we see that their infrared @xmath115 observations of the central @xmath269 of m33 had @xmath252 seeing .",
    "they divided their observations into a `` central core region '' going from @xmath13 to @xmath14 , and an `` inner disk '' region , spanning from a radius of @xmath14 to @xmath270 .",
    "looking at the @xmath252 resolution curve on figure [ fig : blendinglimits ] , we find that at @xmath14 , their photometric limit imposed by blending is @xmath271 , and figure [ fig : nrgbt_reselement ] shows that at this distance there is @xmath199 rgbt star per resolution element . since the number of detected stars in their core region abates at @xmath272",
    ", they are not trying to go much deeper than blending allows .",
    "however , the high density of stars as bright as the rgb tip , and the fact that out to @xmath62 we only find stars as bright as @xmath133 , suggests that some of the brighter ( @xmath273 ) , bluer [ @xmath274 objects they detected in the central region may be blends .",
    "the observations of @xcite are in a similar situation in terms of blending . with @xmath252 resolution they measured stars as bright as @xmath275 in the inner @xmath276 of m33 . however , as figure [ fig : nrgbt_reselement ] shows , at @xmath276 with @xmath252 resolution , there are @xmath277 stars within one magnitude of the tip of the rgb per resolution element .",
    "this certainly does not guarantee that these bright objects are blends , but merely shows that the potential for blending is high .",
    "we have used gemini - north to study the stellar populations in the central regions of m33 .",
    "the surface brightness profiles from @xmath4 to @xmath5 , formed from the combination of our data and those of @xcite , show that the data need to be modeled using a three - component , core + spheroid + disk model .",
    "the best - fit parameters are listed in table [ tab : decomposition ] .",
    "these high - resolution observations allow us to accurately measure individual stars to @xmath278 .",
    "artificial star tests (  [ sec : artstartests ] ) show that our completeness is relatively uniform across the field ( 50% at @xmath232 ) , although within @xmath47 from the nucleus the completeness is dramatically lower due to severe crowding . artificial fields are used to understand the observational effects associated with adaptive optics measurements in crowded fields .",
    "based on the slope of the giant branch in the infrared color magnitude diagram , we estimate the mean metallicity to be @xmath1 (  [ sec : metallicity ] ) . using the bolometric luminosities and density of stars on the agb",
    ", we hypothesize two bursts of star formation ; at @xmath3 and @xmath2 gyr ago (  [ sec : age ] ) .",
    "we note however , that this component of young stars may have influenced our metallicity estimate due to the sensitivity of the gb slope on age .",
    "the stellar luminosity function in m33 is shown to be significantly different from that measured in the galactic bulge as viewed through baade s window (  [ sec : lfs ] ) .",
    "the difference in their maximum luminosities is due to differences in ages of the two regions .",
    "we speculate that this is also the origin of their different slopes as well .    in section [ sec : comparison ]",
    "we compare our data with previous observations .",
    "recent work by @xcite is in good agreement with our data , although our observations go @xmath279 magnitudes deeper (  [ sec : davidge ] ) .",
    "we also combine our data with optical hst - wfpc2 measurements @xcite , and present the optical - ir cmd in  [ sec : mighell ] .",
    "this cmd clearly shows that the central regions of m33 are composed of young , intermediate , and old aged stellar populations .    dividing the inner @xmath280 ( @xmath281 pc ) into equal area rings around the nucleus",
    ", we look for radial variations in the stellar properties (  [ sec : radial_variations ] ) .",
    "however , based on the distribution of stellar luminosities and the morphology of the cmd , we find that all stars are consistent with being drawn from a single population .    in the last section (  [ sec : blending ] )",
    "we perform calculations to estimate the severity of blending at various imaging resolutions and locations in m33 . using the formulations of @xcite and our composite surface brightness profile , these calculations call into question some previous claims of very luminous stars in the central regions of m33 .",
