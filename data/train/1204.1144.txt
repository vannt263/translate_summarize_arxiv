    "magnetotransport measurements on dilute p - si / sige / si structures , with two - dimensional hole gas ( 2dhg ) densities of about 10@xmath4@xmath5 , have revealed an unusual phenomenon at filling factor @xmath12=3/2 , the so - called `` re - entrant '' metal - insulator transition .",
    "@xcite this phenomenon manifests itself as an additional peak of the magnetoresistance @xmath13 at @xmath12=3/2 .",
    "the peak demonstrates an insulator type behavior , i.e. its magnitude increases with decreasing sample temperature .",
    "@xcite    the authors of ref",
    ".   explained this appearance by the presence of smooth long - range potential fluctuations having a magnitude comparable to the fermi energy .",
    "however , in refs .",
    "the magnetoresistance anomaly was attributed to a crossing of landau levels ( lls ) with different spin directions 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 as the magnetic field increased .",
    "it appears that some p - si / sige / si systems show a magnetoresistance anomaly at @xmath14 that depends on the tilt angle between the magnetic field and sample normal ,  @xcite whereas in other p - si / sige / si systems this anomaly is not manifested at all .",
    "@xcite a third set of p - si / sige / si systems have such anomaly in @xmath0 at @xmath14 , but it does not depend on the tilt angle .",
    "@xcite    in our earlier article  @xcite , we analyzed _ the conductivity _ at @xmath12=2 in tilted magnetic fields in a sample with @xmath2=2@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 and demonstrated the presence of a ferromagnetic - paramagnetic ( f - p ) transition at a tilt angle of about 60@xmath10 .",
    "it should be noted that at @xmath12=3/2 we did not observe any significant variation of the conductivity , instead a resistivity peak of the re - entrant - transition - type occurred in this region of filling factor .",
    "we therefore focused our research on the @xmath12=2 region , i.e. in the vicinity of the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition .",
    "the magnetoresistance components @xmath0 and @xmath1 for the p - si / sige / si structure were measured in a tilted magnetic field , from which the conductivity @xmath15 was calculated together with its dependence on temperature @xmath16 , magnetic field , and the tilt angle @xmath9 .",
    "such an approach allowed us to approximately calculate values of the landau level energies , rather than just providing a qualitative description of the phenomenon , as was presented in refs .  .",
    "the f - p phase transition seen at @xmath172 , @xmath16=0.3 k , and @xmath1860@xmath10 , is the result of crossing of the 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 lls .",
    "this transition is characterized by a jump in the filling factor and by a coexistence of both phases in the transition region .",
    "a f - p transition has previously been reported in p - si / sige / si at @xmath12=4 and 6 in a tilted magnetic field by the authors of ref .  .",
    "the present paper is an continuation of our previous article  [ ] and has three aims : ( i ) to study the dependence of the energy gap between lls 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 on the magnetic field tilt angle @xmath9 to provide further confirmation of the crossing of these levels , in the p - si / sige / si sample with @xmath2=2@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 ; ( ii ) to investigate the conductivity anisotropy in this sample , by measuring the conductivity at different orientations of the magnetic field component in the sample plane with respect to the current : @xmath19 and @xmath20 , and comparing this with the theoretical model proposed in  [ ] ; ( iii ) to measure the magnetoresistance in a tilted magnetic field for another p - si / sige / si sample with a lower density of @xmath2=7.2@xmath310@xmath8@xmath5 and compare it with the experimental data obtained by other groups on similar samples  @xcite , with the hope of clearing up the inconsistency of the previous results mentioned above .",
    "in this research we studied two p - si / sige / si systems grown on a si ( 100 ) substrate that consisted of a 300 nm si buffer layer followed by a 30 nm si@xmath21ge@xmath22 layer , 20 nm undoped si spacer , and 50 nm layer of b - doped si with a doping concentration of 2.5@xmath310@xmath23@xmath24 .",
    "one sample had x=0.08 , yielding @xmath2=7.2@xmath310@xmath25@xmath5 , and the second had x=0.13 , with @xmath2=2@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 .",
    "both samples had a hole mobility of about 1@xmath310@xmath26@xmath27/vs at liquid - helium temperatures .    in the sample with @xmath2=2@xmath310@xmath4@xmath5 we measured the temperature dependence of the conductivity at different tilt angles @xmath9 over the temperature range 20 mk to 1 k , from which we were able to determine the activation energy @xmath28 at various angles via the slope of the arrhenius curves :",
    "the dependence of the activation energy on the tilt angle @xmath9 is shown in figure  [ activa ] , where it can clearly be seen that the activation energy achieves a minimum at @xmath3060@xmath10 .",
    "the conductivity @xmath15(@xmath9 ) at the minima of oscillations at @xmath172 , also shows a maximum as a function of tilt angle at @xmath1860@xmath10 , as shown in the inset to figure  [ activa ] .",
    "it is worth noting that when the measurements are performed with the magnetic field normal to the sample plane the energy gap related to @xmath31 2 is about 3.2 k ( 0.28 mev ) .",
    "thus , we are justified in extracting the energy gap value from the temperature range of 200 mk - 1 k. when the tilt angle approaches 60@xmath10 the size of the energy gap is very small , due to the lls crossing .",
    "so , whilst the actual gap value obtained here is subject to considerable uncertainty , the observation of a minimum of the energy gap value at about 60@xmath10 qualitatively supports our model .",
    "these facts confirm that the observed f - p transition is indeed associated with the crossing of the lls 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 at 60@xmath32 . now , knowing the activation energy dependence on @xmath9 and using the value @xmath28=0.28 mev found in ref .   for @xmath9=0",
    ", we can get a more accurate angle dependence of the energies of the levels 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 .",
    "it is presented in figure  [ fig : levels3117 ] .",
    "the f - p transition is expected to be accompanied by the formation of ferromagnetic domains . according to ref .",
    ", the domain formation should be manifested in an anisotropy of the magnetoresistance , i.e. in a tilted field the value of the magnetoresistance should depend on the orientation of @xmath33 , the in - plane projection of the magnetic field , with respect to the current .",
    "for example , an anisotropy in the region where lls cross has been reported in several papers for gaas / algaas  @xcite and n - si / sige  @xcite heterostructures .",
    "we tilted the sample in the two possible orientations , keeping the field projection ( @xmath34 ) parallel and ( @xmath35 ) perpendicular to the current , but did not observe any anisotropy of the magneto - resistance in the vicinity of the transition .",
    "figure  [ fig : sxxanis ] illustrates the dependence of the conductivity on the normal component of the applied magnetic field @xmath36 at different angles and for both orientations of the in - plane projection of @xmath37 relative to the current .",
    "as seen in figure  [ fig : sxxanis ] , the curves for the different directions of the in - plane projection of the magnetic field ( @xmath19 and @xmath35 ) virtually coincide , i. e. in our case the anisotropy of the conductivity is absent with a high degree of accuracy .",
    "we also carried out similar studies at @xmath16=(18 - 200 ) mk for the lower density p - si / sige / si sample with @xmath38 @xmath5 .",
    "the dependence of the resistivity @xmath0 on the magnetic field for different tilt angles are shown in figure  [ fig : rxx3212 ] .",
    "we particularly notice that , at tilt angles @xmath39 from @xmath40 to 70@xmath10 , the oscillations corresponding to @xmath12=2 are extremely weak .",
    "they only start manifesting themselves for @xmath39 70@xmath10 . at @xmath12=3/2 ,",
    "a maximum of resistance appears similar to the one we observed in the other sample , with a magnitude that depends strongly on the tilt angle .",
    "yet the oscillations at @xmath12=2 are clearly visible in another way of measuring the magnetoresistance : when the sample is rotated in a fixed total magnetic field , the perpendicular field component @xmath36 causes oscillations at the angles determined by the concentration of charge carriers in the sample .",
    "figure  [ fig : rxxrotate ] shows such an angle dependence of the magnetoresistance measured at several fixed magnetic fields , where the oscillation related to @xmath12=2 can be seen to move from a tilt of about 9@xmath10 at 10 t to 5@xmath10 at 18 t. this corresponds to @xmath36= 1.7 t in each case , as shown in the figure  [ fig : rxxrotate ] inset .",
    "@xcite the field value for @xmath12=2 @xmath37=1.7 t is slightly different from data shown above .",
    "this is probably a result of an ageing of the sample as the experiments of ref .",
    "were done much earlier .",
    "the dependence of the conductivity @xmath15 on the normal component of the magnetic field @xmath36 is shown in figure  [ fig : sxx3212 ] at different tilt angles , with @xmath34 . since the oscillations of @xmath0 at high tilt angles are observed against a background of high resistance with @xmath41 , it turns out that @xmath42 , so minima in @xmath0 correspond to maxima in @xmath15 , as observed at @xmath431.5 t in figure  [ fig : sxx3212 ] .",
    "the absence of oscillations at magnetic fields corresponding to @xmath12=2 in the range of angles ( 0 - 70)@xmath10 indicates that the 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 lls coincide .",
    "the appearance of these oscillations for @xmath4470@xmath10 is due , in our opinion , to the fact that the levels begin to diverge , resulting in the energy gap opening up .",
    "apparently , the gap opening in the sample with @xmath45@xmath5 is associated with the angle dependence of the g - factor .",
    "the g - factor in this material is anisotropic  @xcite and depends on the magnetic field tilt angle relative to the sample surface normal . if the g - factor had an axial symmetry we could write @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the g - factor with the magnetic field perpendicular to the 2dhg , and @xmath48 is with the magnetic field parallel to the 2dhg . for strong anisotropy , when @xmath48=0 ( as it should be in our structure ) this reduces to @xmath49",
    ". however , if such a dependence of the g - factor were to occur , then the f - p transition should not be observed .",
    "unfortunately , we are unable to make reliable calculations and determine the width of the gap appearing in the sample with @xmath50@xmath5 due to the large magnetoresistance produced by the parallel magnetic field in this sample .",
    "@xcite it should be noted that the values of @xmath51 and @xmath52 , on which background the oscillations develop , strongly depend on the magnetic field , and the greater the angle the stronger is this dependence .",
    "so , it does not seem to be possible to reliably separate the small oscillations at @xmath4470@xmath10 from the smooth background of @xmath51 , which is about 10@xmath53 ohms .",
    "( such problem for the sample with @xmath54@xmath5 did not arise because the overall change @xmath51/@xmath0(0 ) in a parallel magnetic field of 18 t did not exceed a factor of 4 , and the in - plane resistance was only about 10@xmath26 ohms ) .",
    "thus , the complete f - p transition in the sample with @xmath55@xmath5 is not observed in tilted fields . in a wide range of angles",
    "@xmath9=(0 - 70)@xmath10 the 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 lls are still coinciding , and only for @xmath1170@xmath10 is there a gap in the hole energy spectrum arising as a result of a divergence of the lls .",
    "the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition is observed in a p - si / gesi / si sample with @xmath54@xmath5 at a magnetic field corresponding to filling factor @xmath562 .",
    "it appears as a result of a change in the relative position of the 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 lls as a function of the tilt angle @xmath9 .",
    "this fact was first demonstrated in ref .   and is confirmed in this paper by measurements of the energy gap dependence on the angle @xmath9 .",
    "for this sample we also demonstrate an absence of anisotropy of xx with respect to the magnetic field projection on to the sample plane , despite such an anisotropy having been proposed in ref .  .",
    "at the same time , in the sample with @xmath50@xmath5 the ferromagnetic - paramagnetic transition is not observed . in a wide range of angles",
    "@xmath570 - 70@xmath10 the lls 0@xmath6 and 1@xmath7 coincide , and only for @xmath4470@xmath10 does a gap open in the hole spectrum as a result of the lls diverging .",
    "ambiguity in the results observed by various authors  @xcite , as well as ourselves , on different p - si / gesi / si samples is due , in our opinion , to dissimilar dependences of the g - factors on the magnetic field tilt angle .",
    "this is caused by different levels of disorder in all these samples , since disorder can lead to breaking of the axial symmetry .",
