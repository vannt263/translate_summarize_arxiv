    "after icecube results , see e.g.  @xcite , the importance of a precise description of oscillations has increased greatly . in the present paper we discuss a natural , easy - to - use and completely general choice of the relevant parameters .",
    "we illustrate its usefulness by quantifying the impact of the uncertainties on various physical quantities , implied by the imprecise knowledge on oscillations .",
    "we begin by recalling the main achievements in the discussion of cosmic neutrino oscillations . the general formula for the vacuum averaged oscillations was given in @xcite . ref .",
    "@xcite studied for the first time the implications of the observed oscillation phenomena on cosmic neutrinos .",
    "various authors remarked the possibility to measure flavor ratios , possibly aiming to constrain the parameters of oscillations , e.g.  @xcite .",
    "the relevance of oscillations for the interpretation of glashow resonance was noted in @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the single parameter that rules cosmic neutrino oscillations and depends linearly upon unknown quantities was identified ; then , it was remarked @xcite that this leads to a strong correlation between the effect of the oscillation parameters on the probabilities of oscillation , lessening chances of measuring the oscillation parameters .",
    "non - linear effects were studied in various subsequent papers including @xcite .",
    "an interesting expression for all relevant parameters of vacuum oscillations was proposed in @xcite within a scheme of approximation aimed to improve the tribimaximal mixing matrix . in @xcite",
    "an expansion in second order of small parameters of this parameterization was obtained and applied to the study of cosmic neutrinos .",
    "the consistency of vacuum oscillations and icecube observations was discussed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite compare with @xcite . in @xcite the impact on the flavor ratio of the uncertainties on oscillation parameters was analyzed and the present work develops the discussion .    in this work , we show that the parameterization of neutrino oscillations in vacuum introduced in  @xcite can be promoted to an exact parameterization and can be argued to be the natural parameterization for the discussion of oscillations of cosmic neutrinos .",
    "we obtain new and exact expressions of the three parameters in terms of the known mixing angles and cp violating phase .",
    "we evaluate their numerical values and uncertainties , illustrating their usefulness by discussing three applications : 1 )  we compare the predicted flavor fractions and those that are allowed by the present observations ; 2 )  we quantify the uncertainties in the prediction of the fraction of muon neutrinos due to oscillations ; 3 )  we argue that , even after accounting very conservatively for the uncertainties of oscillations , the intensity of the glashow resonance @xcite differs greatly in the alternative cases of @xmath0- and @xmath1-production as remarked in @xcite and later discussed in @xcite . throughout this work",
    ", we argue that a gaussian treatment of the errors of these natural parameters is quite adequate for the present precision .",
    "in this section , we motivate , define and analyze a parameterization of vacuum neutrino oscillations , elucidating the relationship between this and other parameterizations .",
    "we begin by counting the number of independent vacuum oscillation parameters  @xcite @xmath2 in the case of @xmath3 light neutrinos .",
    "the vacuum oscillation formula depends upon the squares of the leptonic mixing matrix @xmath4 .",
    "they correspond to @xmath5 independent parameters , as it is clear considering all @xmath4 as independent ( albeit constrained ) parameters except the ones of the first row and column , that can be obtained from unitarity , e.g. , @xmath6 .",
    "but the vacuum oscillation probabilities @xmath7 are also _ symmetric _ in the exchange of the flavor indices @xmath8 , thus they require less parameters .",
    "since we can again rely on similar unitarity relations when we sum on all flavors , namely @xmath9 , this implies that the number of independent parameter is just @xmath10 .",
    "this means that when @xmath11 we have 3 independent parameters , when @xmath12 we have 6 of them , etc .    from here on and in view of the present experimental situation , we focus on the three flavor case ( @xmath11 ) where we have three parameters , as first remarked ( to the best of our knowledge ) in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "next , we motivate and introduce the choice of the three natural parameters . the parameters @xmath13 are defined as follow , @xmath14 we can write in terms of @xmath13 the matrix that contains the probabilities of oscillations of cosmic neutrinos .",
    "this is the following symmetric matrix , @xmath15 it acts on the vector of fluxes before oscillations @xmath16 just as @xmath17 , giving the vector of fluxes observed after oscillations , @xmath18 .",
    "we would like to give our reasons ( that are largely based on the available experimental information ) why we consider that eq .",
    "[ our ] is the optimal choice of parameters .    1 .",
    "the oscillation probability that is singled out in @xmath19 is @xmath20 , that is well - known ( being directly measured by low energy solar neutrino experiments and probed also by reactor and high energy solar neutrino experiments ) .",
    "the difference of @xmath21 contains most of the uncertainties .",
    "the last combination of oscillations probabilities , @xmath22 , is positive and very small .",
    "a specific choice of the overall coefficients is adopted in order to have coefficients that are either zero or close to 1 in the expressions of all oscillation probabilities , eq .",
    "5 .   setting @xmath23 ,",
    "all oscillation probabilities become @xmath24 , namely , any information on the original flavor is lost : the three parameters describe the potentially measurable information on flavor that survives cosmic neutrino oscillations .",
    "the above argument clarifies that it is possible to introduce such a parameterization directly , without the need to associate it to a specific scheme of approximation of the mixing matrix , but rather , keeping it exact .",
    "however , various approximation schemes used in the literature have allowed to uncover the most interesting properties : the second one is known since @xcite while the first evidences of the third one were found in @xcite .",
    "a detailed comparison with other parameterizations used in the literature is offered in sect  [ xxx ] .",

[ flavour ] are just identical to those of fig .",
    "[ flavour2 ] .    on the contrary ,",
    "the 1@xmath76 , 2@xmath76 and 3@xmath76 zones do depend on the energy distribution of the neutrinos . the confidence levels , indicated in the flavor triangle , correspond to the result of the data analysis of icecube events ( the high energy starting events , whose initial vertex is in the detectors and the passing muons , i.e.  the thrugoing muons ) discussed in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the comparison with fig .",
    "[ flavour ] shows that the actual value of the spectral index plays some role in determining the allowed regions : the steeper spectrum @xmath78 enhances the role of electron neutrinos and diminishes the one of muon neutrinos ( whose effective area is very small close to the threshold ) thus it requires to increase the content of muon neutrinos at the source @xmath79 in order to reproduce the observed track - to - shower ratio .",

    "the pion decay , that is the most plausible mechanism , is between the two extreme situations ; the error on the muon fraction @xmath70 is about  3@xmath84 .",

    "<S> the natural parameterization of vacuum oscillations in three neutrino flavors is studied . </S>",
    "<S> compact and exact relations of its three parameters with the ordinary three mixing angles and cp violating phase are obtained . </S>",
    "<S> its usefulness is illustrated by considering various applications : the study of the flavor ratio and of its uncertainties , the comparison of expectations and observations in the flavor triangle , the intensity of the signal due to glashow resonance . the results in the literature are easily reproduced and in particular the recently obtained agreement of the observations of icecube with the hypothesis of cosmic neutrino oscillations is confirmed . it is argued that a gaussian treatment of the errors appropriately describes the effects of the uncertainties on neutrino oscillation parameters . </S>"
