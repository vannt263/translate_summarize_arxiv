    "the properties of the flavor singlet pseudoscalar @xmath0 meson provide a unique phenomenological window on the topological structure of qcd .",
    "the mass of the @xmath0 is believed to arise from topologically nontrivial gauge configurations via the axial @xmath2 anomaly . in a semiclassical treatment ,",
    "the effect of instanton contributions to the @xmath3 annihilation ( `` hairpin '' ) diagram breaks the degeneracy between the @xmath0 and the flavor octet goldstone bosons . in an effective chiral lagrangian description of qcd , the @xmath3 hairpin can be interpreted as an @xmath0 mass insertion . within the large @xmath4 approximation , witten and veneziano",
    "@xcite showed that the topological theory of @xmath2 breaking is consistent with the mass - insertion view , and that in this approximation , the @xmath0 mass in the chiral limit is proportional to the topological susceptibility @xmath5 of _ pure gauge _ ( quenched ) qcd .",
    "@xmath6 ( note : here we take @xmath7 normalized to have the experimental value of @xmath8 mev .",
    "this differs from that used in ref .",
    "@xcite by a factor @xmath9 . )",
    "the study of the @xmath0 propagator in lattice qcd is of great interest , not only as a quantitative check of the theory of the @xmath10 problem , but also as a particularly sensitive probe of the differences between quenched and full qcd .",
    "for example , if the hairpin diagram behaves like a mass insertion , the quenched @xmath0 momentum - space propagator is expected to include a double goldstone pole contribution .",
    "@xmath11 as a result , quenched chiral logs arising from virtual @xmath0 loops will complicate the chiral behavior of quenched qcd compared with that of the full theory@xcite .",
    "one of the purposes of the study reported here is to investigate in detail the time - dependence of the hairpin contribution to the @xmath0 propagator and compare it with that expected from the double pole structure ( [ eq : doublepole ] ) .",
    "the method we use to calculate closed loops which originate at a given site of the lattice was introduced by kuramashi , et al @xcite in their original study of the @xmath0 mass . in this `` allsource '' technique",
    ", the quark propagator is calculated using a source given by a unit color - spin vector on _ every _ space - time point of the lattice .",
    "the closed quark loop from a given point is then calculated by assuming random - phase cancellation of other non - gauge - invariant terms .",
    "a particular difficulty encountered in the @xmath0 hairpin calculation is the presence of rapidly increasing non - gaussian errors in the limit of small quark mass due to exceptional configurations .",
    "this problem is more severe in the hairpin calculation than it is in ordinary hadron spectrum calculations .",
    "recently , the origin of the exceptional configuration problem has been traced to the presence of topological zero mode poles in the quark propagator which have been displaced to values of the hopping parameter below @xmath12 by lattice effects .",
    "@xcite a practical method for removing this lattice artifact , the modified quenched approximation ( mqa ) , has been proposed in ref .",
    "an example of the mqa improvement of the hairpin propagator is shown in figs . 1 and 2 .",
    "the propagators shown in figs . 1 and 2 were obtained on a @xmath13 lattice at @xmath14 with a hopping parameter of @xmath15 ( @xmath16 mev ) .",
    "the improvement of errors due to the mqa pole - shifting is impressive . for lighter quark masses , the data for the @xmath13 lattice without the mqa improvement is unusable due to extremely large errors .",
    "after mqa improvement it is possible to accurately calculate the hairpin diagram down to very light quark masses . in our calculations",
    ", we have shifted all poles which were found below @xmath17 and have calculated the hairpin for @xmath18 values up to .1685 .",
    "it may be feasible to go to even lighter quark mass values , but the calculation of pole residues above @xmath19 becomes rapidly more expensive in computer time .",
    "the hairpin diagram has been calculated on two ensembles of gauge configurations available in the acpmaps library .",
    "one ensemble included 200 configurations on a @xmath13 lattice at @xmath14 .",
    "the other ensemble consists of 200 configurations at @xmath14 on a @xmath20 lattice .",
    "all together we have calculated the results for seven different values of hopping parameter ranging from .161 to .1685 .",
    "in general , the hairpin insertion may not be a simple @xmath21-independent mass insertion , but instead may exhibit some @xmath21-dependence . expanding around the pion mass shell ,",
    "we may write @xmath22 the second term corresponds to an additon to the @xmath0 kinetic term in the chiral lagrangian . the form of the hairpin insertion may be determined by studying the time - dependence of the hairpin propagator .",
    "if the hairpin vertex is a simple @xmath21-independent mass insertion , the measured propagator at zero 3-momentum should behave according to a pure double - pole formula , @xmath23 the value of @xmath24 is determined quite accurately from the valence pion propagator , so the only adjustable parameter in this fit is the overall normalization @xmath25 . the second term in ( 3 )",
    "would contribute a single - pole term to the propagator ( 2 ) , which gives a term in ( 4 ) with pure exponential time dependence .",
    "thus , both single and double pole terms are included by replacing the factor @xmath26 in ( 4 ) by @xmath27 .",
    "the prelimnary results of this analysis indicate that there is very little @xmath21 dependence of the hairpin insertion .",
    "indeed , the time dependence of the propagators is remarkably well described by the pure double - pole formula ( 4 ) over the entire observable range of time separations .",
    "an example for the @xmath20 lattice at @xmath28 is shown in fig .",
    "2 .    by fitting the propagators to ( [ eq : dptime ] ) , and dividing out apppropriate factors obtained from the valence pion propagator",
    ", we obtain a value for @xmath29 at each @xmath18 .",
    "the @xmath30 results are consistent with those reported last year @xcite .",
    "the finite volume increase observed in the @xmath31 data @xcite is found to be largely an effect of having more nearby visible poles on the smaller box .",
    "after the mqa shift , the results on the two box sizes are within a standard deviation of each other",
    ". the mqa analysis of @xmath7 is not yet completed , but using previous results for @xmath7 , calculated on the @xmath13 configurations , we obtain an effective chiral log parameter of @xmath32 at @xmath33 .",
    "the full results and comparison with other work will be presented elsewhere .    as a byproduct of the hairpin propagator calculation , we may calculate the integrated pseudoscalar charge density @xmath34 on each lattice in the ensemble . as first suggested by smit and vink @xcite ,",
    "this provides a fermionic method for determining the winding number @xmath35 of a gauge configuration , using the integrated anomaly equation , which gives @xmath36 . using the allsource quark propagators , improved by the mqa pole shifting procedure , we have employed the smit - vink method to calculate the topological susceptibility @xmath37 ( where @xmath38 is the lattice 4-volume ) for both the @xmath13 and @xmath20 ensembles .",
    "the results show only a mild @xmath18 dependence and can be sensibly extrapolated to zero quark mass . using the scale @xmath39 gev taken from charmonium",
    ", we obtain @xmath40 gev@xmath41 for the @xmath13 lattice , and @xmath42 gev@xmath41 for the @xmath20 lattice .",
    "this can be compared with @xmath43 gev@xmath41 from the wv formula ( 1 ) .",
