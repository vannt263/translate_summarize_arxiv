    "most ambitiously , the inflaton  the field that drives the inflationary expansion  could itself be an unparticle .",
    "we shall show that the conformal properties of unparticles , however , make them very unsuitable for this purpose . yet , even if they are not themselves responsible for inflation , unparticles can still produce interesting effects .",
    "if they interact with an ordinary particle inflaton , the loop corrections from unparticles can enhance the power spectrum of the primordial perturbations produced by inflation .",
    "this enhancement occurs whenever the scaling dimension of the unparticle field is less than three - halves and it is most pronounced at the large - wavelength end of the power spectrum .",

    "an unparticle is nothing more than a scale - invariant field with a nontrivial scaling dimension , @xmath0 .",
    "the simplest and most familiar scalar field with these properties is not an unparticle at all , but is rather an ordinary massless particle , corresponding to the case @xmath1 .",
    "once we go beyond integral values for @xmath0 , however , the fields no longer have many of the properties that we associate with particles",
    ". there are no isolated poles in the propagator and there is no longer a simple dispersion relation between the energy and the momentum carried by an unparticle . because of its scaling or conformal properties , an unparticle in a conformally flat space - time is closely related to one in flat space , so we shall first examine this relation in a little detail for the case of a conformal particle .    in a curved background , it is not enough to set the mass of a particle to zero to insure that the theory remains scale - invariant , since the background itself introduces another potential source for breaking it . to restore the scale invariance , the field",

    "if we denote an unparticle in flat space by @xmath11 and the unparticle in a conformally flat space by @xmath12 , then we can again write the latter as a simple rescaling of the former , @xmath13 determined by its rescaling dimension @xmath0 .      in a lorentz - invariant theory ,",
    "the propagator of any scalar field can be expressed in a lehmann - k \" allen spectral form , @xmath14 for an ordinary particle theory , @xmath15 contains at least one pole at the physical mass of the field .",
    "the field is then also renormalized so that the residue at this pole is @xmath16 , which amounts to a renormalization condition on the theory .",
    "in contrast , for an unparticle theory , we do not have any such conditions available to determine @xmath15 . instead",

    "had we not integrated over the spectral parameter @xmath21 earlier , the wightman function would have assumed a form that more explicitly shows its similarity to its flat space form , @xmath42 this form will be useful in the next section where we derive the power spectrum for an unparticle inflaton .",
    "at a first glance , unparticles might appear to provide an interesting alternative for the inflaton itself , since the conformality of the field might be used to control some fine - tunings that occur for an ordinary inflaton .",
    "in the usual inflationary picture , the effective mass of the inflaton must be quite small during the slowly rolling phase when the primordial perturbations are produced .",
    "however , this case corresponds to a massless _ minimally _ coupled field , rather than a massless _ conformally _ coupled one , which is the natural starting point for an unparticle . during inflation ,",
    "the curvature changes rather slowly , so its coupling to the field effectively acts as a large mass term for a particle inflaton  the @xmath1 case  which produces a highly tilted power spectrum for the primordial perturbations .",
    "generalizing to the unparticle case , @xmath3 , only worsens the shape of the power spectrum , as we shall learn in this section .    in inflation ,",
    "the tiny primordial perturbations begin as the fluctuations of a quantum field .",
    "the actual field responsible for producing the primordial perturbations is a combination of the inflaton and the scalar component of the metric fluctuations , but we shall simplify the picture somewhat by treating this combination as a pure unparticle .",
    "the quantum fluctuations continually occur during the slowly rolling phase and are stretched to vast scales , whereupon they become essentially frozen into the space - time background .",
    "the simplest measure of this pattern , which provides the initial input used to describe a variety of features of our universe , is the two - point function or equivalently its fourier transform , the _ power spectrum _ , @xmath43 .",

    "although we mentioned in the beginning that unparticles provide just one example of how nature might surprise us , they are actually not so exotic when compared with other possibilities .",
    "unparticles can even arise from a particle theory with the right properties . as an example , consider a setting where at very high energies we have three sorts of particles : the inflaton , some proto - unparticles , and a heavy particle of mass @xmath59 that interacts with the other two . at energies below @xmath59",
    ", we can integrate out the heavy particles to generate interactions between the inflaton and the proto - unparticles , suppressed by some power of @xmath60 .",

    "this observation implies that we have the following hierarchy of scales , @xmath69      even if the inflaton is not itself an unparticle , the presence of unparticles during inflation can still influence the pattern of primordial perturbations",
    ". the leading influence will be through the most relevant , or lowest dimension , operators .",

    "similarly , its dual evolves as @xmath77 notice that the conjugation effectively reverses time - ordering .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian is given by the operator at the beginning of the section , @xmath78 which we have evaluated in de sitter space .",

    "this condition defines a state known as the bunch - davies vacuum @xcite , which in de sitter space is given by @xmath85 where the index depends on the mass of the field , @xmath86    for simplicity , and since the effective mass ought to be very small during the inflationary phase , we shall work in the limit of a perfectly massless inflaton , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , for which the modes , @xmath89 and the wightman functions , @xmath90 simplify considerably .",

    "an unparticle is much more useful as an additional ingredient in the standard inflationary picture . as an example , the loop correction produced when an unparticle interacts with a scalar inflaton particle tends to add to the long wavelength end of the power spectrum .",
