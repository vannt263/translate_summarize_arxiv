    "in particular , five criterions to build a quantum computer are satisfied :    1 .",
    "scalability of extendible qubits : the qubits is the so - called surface codes ( two degenerate ground states of @xmath0 topological orders on a plane with a hole ) .",
    "so the quantum computer is just a line of holes in the @xmath0 topological order .",
    "2 .   initialization ( creation of highly entangled states ) : we may polarize the pseudo - spins by adding an effective field along x - direction and then removing it slowly .",
    "3 .   local operations on multi - qubit :",
    "the unitary operations can do by controlling the external field along particular direction within fixed times .",
    "4 .   measurement of entangled states : we may measure the expected values of pseudo - spin operators by observing the quasi - particles interferences from ab effect . 5 .",
    "low decoherence : below the crossover temperature @xmath266  the decoherence processes will be controlled as low as possible .",
    "finally we discuss the realization of the kitaev toric - code model .",
    "because it can be regarded as an effective model of the kitaev model on a two dimensional hexagonal lattice , one may realize the kitaev model firstly .",
    "the realization of the kitaev model has been proposed in an optical lattice of cold atoms in ref.@xcite and in josephson junction array of a superconductor in ref.@xcite .",
    "so it is possible to design a quantum computer in these system in the future .    in general .",
    "to design a topological quantum computer via quantum tunneling effect , there are four necessary conditions : 1 ) @xmath0 topological order as the ground states ; 2 ) controllable dispersion of quasi - particles ; 3 ) space with nontrivial topological structure ( manifold with high genus or multi - hole ) ; 4 ) low temperature and low noise . thus considering these conditions ,",
    "one may do tqc based on other models .",
    "there are two types of edge states of the kitaev toric - code model . for a boundary parallels x - direction or y - direction ,",
    "there exist the gapless edge states described by majorana fermions@xcite . for a boundary along diagonal directions ( @xmath267 or @xmath268 ) , there is no stable edge state . as a result , in this paper the boundary of both the holes and",
    "the system belong to belongs to the second type ( along diagonal directions ) ."
