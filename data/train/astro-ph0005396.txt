    "the recent broad band spectral analysis of neutron star low mass x - ray binaries ( hereafter ns ) has shown that their spectra are often more complex than previously thought .",
    "in fact , similarly to accreting black holes ( bh ) , these spectra could be described by a power law with high energy cutoff and a soft excess at 0.51 kev .",
    "the thermal comptonization of these soft photons by hot electrons probably originates the power law .",
    "moreover an emission line is usually present at @xmath12 kev interpreted as fluorescence from iron in low ionization states .",
    "the probable origin of this line is from the reprocessed emission from the accretion disk surface illuminated by the primary comptonized spectrum . in this case",
    "one would also expect the presence of a bump between 20 and 40 kev due to compton reflection of the primary spectrum by the disk . indeed this reflection bump has been observed in the spectra of some nss ( barret et al .",
    "1999 ; piraino et al . 1999 ; yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ) , usually with reflection amplitudes ( _ i.e. _ the solid angle @xmath13 subtended by the reflector as seen from the corona ) lower than 0.3 . in these cases",
    "a correlation has been observed between the photon index of the primary spectrum and the reflection amplitude of the reprocessed component ( zdziarski et al .",
    "1999 ; barret et al .",
    "1999 ; piraino et al .",
    "1999 ) , the same observed in seyfert galaxies and galactic bhs .",
    "it was originally thought that the electron temperature in the scattering cloud is lower for the nss than for the bhs ( tavani & barret 1997 ; zdziarski et al .",
    "1998 ; churazov et al .",
    "this is in agreement with the expectation that an extra cooling should be present in the nss because of the soft photons emitted by the surface .",
    "this seems indeed true for those systems in which a high energy cutoff has been observed , although some lmxbs do not show any cutoff in their spectra up to @xmath14 kev ( barret et al .",
    "1991 ; harmon et al . 1996",
    "; piraino et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "this similarity with the spectra of the bhs suggests that the same emission mechanism and geometry operate in nss . in this scenario",
    "the soft excess comes from the accretion disk .",
    "the comptonized component originates in a hot and optically thin cloud ( corona ) , probably placed between the neutron star and the accretion disk .",
    "a fraction of this component is reprocessed by the surface of the accretion disk arising the reflection bump and the iron k@xmath15 line .",
    "the weakness of these components suggests that the reflector subtends a small solid angle ( @xmath16 ) as seen from the corona .",
    "this is possible if the disk is truncated and its inner part is absent , or if the inner accretion disk is highly ionized ( but see done & @xmath17ycki 1999 ) . in this geometry , a decrease of the inner radius of the disk causes an increase of the solid angle subtended by the reflector and a steepness of the power law .",
    "this could be responsible of the observed correlation between the photon index of the power law component and the reflection amplitude .",
    "an advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf , see narayan & yi 1995 for a description ) has been proposed as the origin of the scattering corona in nss as in bhs ( see barret et al .",
    "1999 for a discussion on this argument ) .",
    "however there is an important difference between nss and bhs , because the neutron stars have a solid surface and the advected energy should be released at the surface or in a boundary layer .",
    "this extra soft emission would enhance the compton cooling and result in softer spectra .",
    "barret et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that the boundary layer is optically thin and its emission is hard , even if a reprocessed component from the neutron star surface could also be present .",
    "in this paper we concentrate on the broad band ( 0.1100 kev ) spectral analysis performed on a bepposax observation of mxb 172834 ( 4u 172834 ) .",
    "mxb 172834 is a low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) , belonging to the class of atoll sources ( hasinger and van der klis 1989 ) .",
    "the optical counterpart has not been identified yet , due to the high optical extinction in the galactic center direction . the distance to this source",
    "is poorly known .",
    "it is probably between 4 and 14 kpc ( grindlay & hertz 1981 ) .",
    "observations with the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) have shown kilohertz quasi - periodic oscillations ( khz qpo ) in the persistent emission of mxb 172834 , with frequencies ranging from a few hundred hz up to @xmath18 hz ( strohmayer et al .",
    "usually two khz peaks are simultaneously observed , with a nearly constant difference between their frequencies . if the frequency upper khz qpo is interpreted as the keplerian frequency at the inner rim of the accretion disk ( _ e.g. _ miller , lamb , & psaltis 1998 , stella & vietri 1999 )",
    ", this implies that the disk can arrive very close to the neutron star in these systems .",
    "mxb 172834 shows frequent type - i x - ray bursts ( basinska et al .",
    "recently bursts from this source were observed by rxte ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1997 ) , and nearly coherent oscillations were discovered during the rising phase of the bursts , at a frequency of 363 hz . the oscillation amplitude decreased as the x - ray burst flux increased .",
    "these oscillations likely result from spin modulation of a not uniform x - ray flux produced by the thermonuclear burning that causes the burst .",
    "the frequency separation between the two simultaneous khz qpos is similar to the frequency of the burst oscillations , suggesting a beat frequency mechanism as the origin of the khz qpos ( strohmayer et al .",
    "1996 , miller et al .",
    ". however precise measures of the peak separation between the khz qpos in this source have shown that it is always smaller than 363 hz , and decreases significantly at higher inferred accretion rates ( mndez & van der klis 1999 ) .",
    "the spectrum during the bursts is usually fitted by a blackbody . in the rising phase the blackbody temperature increases from @xmath19 to @xmath20 kev ( foster et al .",
    "1986 ; day & tawara 1990 ) , and , during the burst decay , decreases down to @xmath19 kev ( foster et al .",
    "there is some evidence of the presence of a hard tail during bursts ( foster et al .",
    "1986 ) . from the burst spectrum the radius of the emitting region can be derived and compared with the radius of the neutron star .",
    "usually values well below 10 km are found ( van paradijs 1978 , see also basinska et al .",
    "1984 and references therein ) , _ i.e. _ below the lowest radius allowed for a 1.4 @xmath21 neutron star .",
    "foster et al .",
    "( 1986 ) showed that the measured color temperature of the blackbody can be higher than the effective temperature . using appropriate correcting factors they derive a radius of the emitting region which is consistent with current equations of state , and a distance to the source of 4.3 kpc .",
    "the persistent spectrum of mxb 172834 in the 120 kev energy range , observed by _ einstein _",
    "mpc , was fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung with a temperature of @xmath22 kev ( grindlay and hertz 1981 ) .",
    "the spectrum in the same energy range was also obtained from sas 3 data ( basinska et al .",
    "1984 ) . during the sas 3 long observation ( @xmath23 days )",
    "the source intensity ( in the 120 kev energy range ) was found to vary by a factor @xmath0 .",
    "accordingly the temperature associated to the spectrum was found to vary between 4 and 11 kev , positively correlated with the x - ray flux .",
    "the hard energy spectrum ( 30200 kev ) , observed by sigma telescope ( claret et al . 1994 ) , was also fitted by a thermal bremsstrahlung but with a higher temperature ( @xmath24 kev ) .",
    "the 30200 kev flux was @xmath25 .",
    "the narrow field instruments ( nfi ) on board bepposax satellite ( boella et al .",
    "1997 ) observed mxb 172834 on 1998 august 23 and 24 , for a total exposure time of 24 ks .",
    "the nfis are four co - aligned instruments which cover more than three decades of energy , from 0.1 kev up to 200 kev , with good spectral resolution in the whole range .",
    "lecs ( operating in the range 0.110 kev ) and mecs ( 111 kev ) have imaging capabilities with a field of view ( fov ) of @xmath26 and @xmath27 radius respectively .",
    "we selected the data for scientific analysis in circular regions of @xmath28 and @xmath29 radii for the lecs and mecs respectively centered on the source .",
    "the background subtraction was obtained using blank sky observations , in which we extracted the background spectra in regions of the fov similar to those used for the source .",
    "mxb 172834 is near the galactic plane and in this case simultaneous backgrounds should be used ( parmar et al .",
    "however mxb 172834 is an intense source and the background contributes to less than 1% and 0.3% of the total count rate in the lecs and mecs respectively .",
    "therefore we preferred to use the standard method for background subtraction in this case .",
    "hpgspc ( 760 kev ) and pds ( 13200 kev ) have no imaging capabilities , because the fovs , of @xmath30 fwhm , are delimited by collimators .",
    "the background subtraction for these instruments was obtained using the off - source data accumulated during the rocking of the collimators .    during the persistent emission",
    "the mecs light curve shows little variability of the intensity , the count rate ranging between 25 and 30 counts / s .",
    "we divided the mecs data in two energy bands , soft ( 1.84 kev ) and hard ( 410 kev ) , and calculated the corresponding hardness ratio .",
    "this hardness ratio is constant implying no spectral variations during the bepposax observation .",
    "the average observed flux of the source ( in the 0.1100 kev energy range ) during the persistent emission is @xmath31 ergs @xmath32 s@xmath33 , which corresponds to an unabsorbed luminosity of @xmath34 ergs / s , where @xmath35 is the distance to the source in units of 4 kpc .    during the bepposax observation of mxb 172834 ,",
    "three type - i bursts are present .",
    "the duration of these bursts is between 10 and 15 s , considering the start and end times of each burst when the flux is 10% of the peak above the persistent emission level .",
    "the peak count rate ( measured by the mecs ) is around 500 counts / s for the first and the second burst , and @xmath36 counts / s for the third one .",
    "figure 1 shows the mecs light curve ( upper panel ) , in the energy band 1.810 kev and with the persistent level subtracted , of the first burst and the corresponding hardness ratio ( 410 kev/1.84 kev , lower panel ) .",
    "the hardness ratio seems to decrease from @xmath20 to @xmath19 during the burst decay .",
    "this means that the spectrum softens , as expected by the decay of the blackbody temperature during the burst .",
    "we obtain similar results for the other two bursts .",
    "the energy ranges used in the spectral analysis for each nfi are : 0.124 kev for the lecs , 1.810 kev for the mecs , 830 kev for the hpgspc and 15100 kev for the pds .",
    "different normalizations of the four nfis are considered by including in the model normalizing factors , fixed to 1 for the mecs and kept free for the other instruments .",
    "we used the mecs and pds data to produce the spectra during the bursts , considering the start and end times of each burst when the rate in the mecs is 10% of the peak above the persistent emission level .",
    "lecs and hpgspc data were not used in this case because of the low statistics due to the short duration . with a preliminary fit we verified that the spectra of the three bursts presented the same shape .",
    "therefore , to increase the statistics , we summed the three spectra obtained from the mecs . in the pds ,",
    "only the second and third bursts were observed and summed together . during the first burst , which falls at the beginning of a bepposax orbit ,",
    "the pds was switched off . from the obtained burst spectrum we subtracted the spectrum of the persistent emission , and the result",
    "is shown in figure 2 ( upper panel ) .",
    "we fitted this spectrum with a blackbody modified by interstellar absorption from cold matter . because of the lack of data at energies below 1.8 kev , we fixed the value of the equivalent hydrogen column n@xmath37 at @xmath38 @xmath32 , in agreement with the value obtained from the fit of the bepposax spectrum during the persistent emission ( table 2 , model 4 ) and with previous results ( hoffman et al . 1979 , grindlay & hertz 1981 , foster et al .",
    "1986 ) . in table 1",
    "we report the best fit values of the parameters and in figure 2 ( lower panel ) the residuals ( in units of @xmath39 ) with respect to the best fit model . a hard excess between 20 and 30",
    "kev is visible in these residuals with low statistical significance .",
    "this hard excess is still present when we restrict the mecs data to only the second and third bursts , that are simultaneously observed by mecs and pds . indeed , fitting only the pds data to a blackbody we obtain a higher temperature , between 2.3 and 2.9 kev .",
    "the broad band ( 0.1100 kev ) spectrum during the persistent emission was obtained excluding intervals of @xmath14 s around each burst , and is shown in figure 3 ( upper panel ) . a simple model ( consisting of a single component , like a thermal bremsstrahlung with photoelectric absorption by cold matter ) was not sufficient to fit the spectrum in the whole energy band .",
    "we tried several models and we obtained a good representation of the spectrum using a soft emission that could be equivalently modeled by a multi - color disk blackbody ( _ diskbb _ in xspec , mitsuda et al .",
    "1984 ) or a blackbody , a comptonized component fitted with the _ comptt _ model ( described in titarchuk , 1994 ) , and two gaussian emission lines .",
    "the results of this fits are shown in table 2 ( model 1 and 2 respectively ) .",
    "the comptonized spectrum seems to be better fitted by the _ thcomp _ model ( see the appendix of zdziarski et al .",
    "1996 for a description of this model ) .",
    "the results of this fit are shown in table 2 , model 3 with the soft excess described by a multi - color disk blackbody , and model 4 with the soft excess described by a blackbody . the unfolded spectrum , together with the spectral components used to fit the data , are shown in figure 4 .",
    "the soft emission could be described by a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath40 kev or a multi - color disk blackbody with an inner temperature @xmath41 kev .",
    "as it is evident from table 2 , the values of the parameters characterizing the other components do not vary significantly adopting a multi - color disk blackbody or a blackbody to fit the soft excess . for the comptonized spectrum",
    ", we obtain an electron temperature of @xmath42 kev and an optical depth of @xmath43 for a spherical scattering cloud , with a temperature of the seed photons @xmath44 kev .",
    "we used a broad gaussian to fit an iron k@xmath15 line at @xmath7 kev , with equivalent width of 5070 ev .",
    "we also used a narrow gaussian line to fit an excess in the residuals around 1.7 kev .",
    "the addition of a gaussian emission line at this energy is statistically significant at more than 99.99% confidence level .",
    "the residuals with respect to model 4 are shown in figure 3 ( lower panel ) .",
    "we also tried the presence of an iron edge at 78 kev , but the addition of this component to the model does not improve the fit .",
    "the addition of a reflection component ( _ pexriv _ in xspec , magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) does not improve significantly the fit . the upper limit on the reflection amplitude , corresponding to the solid angle ( in units of @xmath45 ) that the reflector subtends as viewed from the corona , is @xmath46 , using an inclination angle @xmath47 .",
    "however the _ pexriv _ model does not contain the iron emission line that should be present in the reflection component .",
    "therefore we tried a reflection model ( that we shall call _ fe - refl _ ) in which the iron line is self - consistently calculated for the given ionization state , temperature , spectral shape and abundances ( this model is described in detail in @xmath17ycki et al .",
    "1998 ) . excluding the gaussian line at @xmath7 kev and adding this self - consistent reflection model ( with the inclination angle @xmath48 fixed to 0.5 ) , we obtain a fit equivalent to that shown in table 2 ( model 4 ) , with @xmath49 for 614 degrees of freedom .",
    "the observed iron line requires , to be fitted , reflection from a ionized disk ( with @xmath50 ) and a reflection amplitude @xmath51 .",
    "we performed a spectral analysis of the bursts observed by bepposax in the 1.870 kev energy range . we fitted the averaged spectrum during the bursts to a blackbody with a temperature @xmath0 kev",
    "the total luminosity of this blackbody is @xmath52 ergs / s , where @xmath35 is the distance to the source in units of 4 kpc .",
    "this corresponds to a radius of the emitting region of @xmath53 km . because the most probable distance to the source is not much different from 4 kpc ( see foster et al .",
    "1986 , and below ) , this radius is rather low to be identified with the neutron star radius .",
    "however the color temperature of the spectrum can be higher than the effective temperature by a factor 1.4 ( foster et al .",
    "1986 ) . considering this correcting factor",
    "we find an effective radius of the emitting region of @xmath54 km , that is comparable with the radius of a neutron star .",
    "the distance to the source is not well known and is estimated between 4 and 14 kpc ( grindlay & hertz 1981 ) .",
    "however the bursts of this source can be used to infer the distance , as shown by basinska et al .",
    "they found that the maximum burst flux ( @xmath55 ) and the integrated burst flux ( @xmath56 ) are strongly correlated at low flux levels . for high flux levels @xmath55 saturates at the value of @xmath57 ergs @xmath32 s@xmath33 ( calculated in the 120 kev energy range ) .",
    "this is therefore a critical luminosity and might be interpreted as the eddington limit luminosity .",
    "the bursts we see in mxb 172834 during the bepposax observation are far from this saturation level .",
    "the nearest to saturation is the first burst , for which @xmath58 ergs @xmath32 and @xmath59 ergs @xmath32 s@xmath33 ( corresponding to @xmath60 of the critical luminosity level ) , both calculated in the 120 kev energy range and with the persistent level subtracted as in basinska et al .",
    "( 1984 ) . using the fit parameters of table 1",
    ", we can correct the maximum burst flux for absorption and extrapolate it in the 0.1100 kev energy range .",
    "this corresponds to a total maximum luminosity of @xmath61 ergs / s , where d is the distance in kpc . in the interpretation above",
    ", this should be equal to 64% of the eddington luminosity , that is @xmath62 ergs / s for a 1.4 @xmath63 ( van paradijs & mcclintock 1994 ) , giving a distance to the source of @xmath1 kpc .",
    "this is similar to previous estimations based on the bursts ( _ e.g. _ 4.3 kpc , foster et al .",
    "1986 , and 4.2 kpc , van paradijs 1978 ) .    a rather complex model is needed to fit the persistent spectrum .",
    "the continuum consists of a soft emission that could be described by a blackbody or a multi - color disk blackbody plus a comptonized spectrum .",
    "this model is similar to that used for other type - i x - ray bursters , such as 1e 17243045 ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 , barret et al . 1999 ) and ks 1731260 ( barret et al . 1999 ) . for these sources and mxb 172834",
    ", the electron temperature of the scattering region is between 3 and 28 kev and the optical depth between 3 and 10 , with higher temperatures corresponding to lower optical depths , as expected . in the following",
    "we will describe the results we obtained for mxb 172834 in more detail .",
    "the value of the equivalent absorption column @xmath64 is 2.53 @xmath65 @xmath32 , depending on the model used to fit the soft emission ( blackbody or disk multi - temperature blackbody ) .",
    "if the distance of 5.1 kpc inferred from the bursts is correct , this implies a visual extinction of @xmath66 for mxb 172834 ( calculated from hakkila et al .",
    "1997 ) . using the observed correlation between visual extinction and absorption column ( predehl & schmitt 1995 )",
    "we find @xmath67 @xmath32 , which is around half the value we find from the spectral fit .",
    "large values of the absorption column , between 1.5 and 3.5 @xmath65 @xmath32 and even larger , were also found in previous observations of mxb 172834 ( see basinska et al .",
    "therefore there is an excess of attenuation of the soft emission that has to be caused by matter close to the x - ray source , _",
    "e.g. _ by the outer cold regions of an accretion disk or corona .    using a blackbody to describe the soft emission",
    ", we get a temperature of @xmath40 kev .",
    "the luminosity of this component is @xmath68 ergs / s .",
    "this implies a radius of the spherical emitting region of @xmath69 km .",
    "indeed the distance to the source could be higher than the 4 kpc ( grindlay & hertz 1981 ) and therefore the luminosity and the radius of the blackbody emission region could be higher .",
    "for instance , adopting a distance of 5.1 kpc , the calculated radius is @xmath70 km .",
    "therefore the radius of the blackbody emitting region could be rather large to be identified with the neutron star surface . using a multi - color disk blackbody to model the soft excess we obtain an inner disk temperature of @xmath41 kev , and a lower limit for the inner radius of the disk of @xmath71 km .",
    "this source does not show dips in the light curve and therefore the inclination of the normal to the plane of the disk with respect to the line of sight should be less than @xmath72 . assuming an inclination angle @xmath4 of @xmath72 we obtain @xmath73 km for the inner radius of the accretion disk .",
    "moreover the simple multi - color disk blackbody could be not appropriate to describe the emission of accretion disks in x - ray binaries , because the electron scattering will modify the spectrum ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ; white , stella & parmar 1988 ) . in this case",
    ", the measured color temperature is related to the effective temperature of the inner disk @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the spectral hardening factor .",
    "the factor @xmath75 has been estimated by shimura & takahara ( 1995 ) to be @xmath2 for a luminosity @xmath76 of the eddington limit , with a little dependence on the mass of the compact object and the radial position . applying this correction to the values of @xmath77 and @xmath78",
    "reported in table 2 , we obtain an effective temperature of @xmath40 kev , which corresponds to an inner radius @xmath79 km .    in conclusion",
    ", we identify the soft component with the emission from the accretion disk , although we obtain a slightly better fit using the blackbody instead of the multi - color disk blackbody , especially when we describe the comptonized spectrum with _ thcomp _ ( compare model 3 and model 4 in table 2 ) . in the hypothesis that the blackbody represents the emission from the inner accretion disk",
    ", we can calculate the inner radius of the disk from this component , in order to compare the result with the estimate obtained using the multi - color disk blackbody for the soft excess .",
    "the blackbody luminosity is then the total potential energy that has been released at @xmath80 : @xmath81 where we assumed a keplerian , geometrically thin , optically thick accretion disk .",
    "we attribute the measured temperature of the blackbody to the maximum temperature in the disk , that is reached close to the inner radius at @xmath82 @xmath80 ( see _ e.g. _ frank , king , & raine 1985 ) .",
    "@xmath83 where we assumed that the disk is truncated at @xmath80 and that the zero - torque condition can be applied at @xmath80 . using these two equations",
    "we can find the inner radius of the disk as a function of the measured temperature and luminosity of the blackbody : @xmath84 considering the values reported in table 2 ( model 4 ) , we obtain @xmath85 km for mxb 172834 , that becomes @xmath86 km considering a spectral hardening factor of @xmath2 .",
    "this value is similar to the result obtained with the multi - color disk blackbody .",
    "the second component of our model is a comptonized spectrum , produced in a hot ( @xmath87 kev ) region of spherical shape and moderate optical depth ( @xmath43 ) surrounding the neutron star .",
    "this comptonized spectrum requires soft seed photons at a temperature of @xmath88 kev , that is significantly higher than the temperature of the disk .",
    "the emission from the neutron star surface and/or from an optically thick or thin boundary layer ( see the discussion in barret et al .",
    "1999 on the possible existence of an optically thin boundary layer ) could then account for the seed photons subsequently comptonized in the surrounding corona .",
    "this could explain why we do not observe directly the emission from the neutron star and is in agreement with our identification of the blackbody as the emission from the accretion disk .",
    "adopting the geometry described above one would expect a compton reflection by the accretion disk of the hard spectrum emitted by the corona .",
    "this would produce a bump in the spectrum , that can be described by the _",
    "pexriv _ model .",
    "this reflection is not significantly detected in mxb 172834 ( nor in the similar sources 1e 17243045 , guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 , barret et al . 1999 , and ks 1731260 , barret et al . 1999 ) .",
    "a possible reason could be the low temperature of the spectrum emitted by the corona . because most of the hard photons have energies below 10 kev",
    ", they will be photoelectric absorbed by the matter in the disk , and re - emitted at the temperature of the disk , rather than compton scattered .",
    "this explains why we obtained a rather high upper limit in the reflection amplitude ( @xmath46 ) using _ pexriv_. it is probable that the reflection component can be observed in a harder state of this source .",
    "this argument could also be applied to ks 1731260 , whose spectrum is indeed soft , with an electron temperature of @xmath89 kev ( barret et al . 1999 ) , but shows some difficulties when applyed to 1e 17243045 , whose spectrum is harder with an electron temperature @xmath90 kev ( guainazzi et al .",
    "1998 , barret et al . 1999 ) . in this case",
    "barret et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest that the inclination of the source could be high and this could reduce the reflection component .",
    "we note that up to date the reflection component has been detected only in sources with very hard spectra , such as gs 1826238 ( with a cutoff energy @xmath91 kev , barret et al .",
    "1999 ) , slx 1735269 ( with a cutoff energy @xmath92 kev , barret et al .",
    "1999 ) , 4u 0614 + 09 ( with a cutoff energy @xmath93 kev , piraino et al . 1999 ) and 4u 160852 ( with a cutoff energy at 300 kev , yoshida et al .",
    "1993 ) .",
    "the irradiation of the accretion disk by the x - ray primary spectrum should also produce an iron emission line at @xmath12 kev .",
    "therefore we can better constrain the parameters of the reflection component with the _ fe - refl _ model , which includes a self - consistent calculation of this line . using such a model , instead of the gaussian , to fit the iron line , we find that the reflector has to be ionized ( @xmath9 ) and we derive an upper limit on the reflection amplitude of @xmath10 , much stringent than the value found using _",
    "pexriv_.    two emission lines , at 6.7 kev and 1.66 kev , are needed to fit the spectrum of mxb 172834 .",
    "the line at @xmath7 kev is interpreted as emission from highly ionized iron .",
    "a broad emission line at 6.7 kev is compatible with being emitted in a strongly ionized region such as the corona or the inner part of the disk . the second emission line , at @xmath8 kev , is compatible with the radiative recombination emission from mg xi .",
    "these x - ray emission lines at low energies likely arise in a photoionized corona ( liedahl et al .",
    "1992 , see white , nagase & parmar 1995 as a review ) .",
    "we analysed data from a bepposax observation of mxb 172834 performed in 1998 august between 23 and 24 .",
    "three type - i x - ray bursts were present during this observation . the spectrum during the bursts is fitted by a blackbody with a temperature @xmath0 kev .",
    "we calculated the corresponding effective radius of the blackbody emitting region , that is @xmath94 km , comparable with the neutron star radius .",
    "assuming that the peak flux _ vs. _ fluence relationship of the bursts saturates at the eddington limit luminosity , we find a distance to the source of 5.1 kpc .",
    "the spectrum during the persistent emission is described by a blackbody with a temperature of @xmath40 kev , a comptonized spectrum , and two gaussian emission lines at 1.66 kev and 6.7 kev respectively . in the hypothesis that the blackbody is emitted by the accretion disk",
    "we estimate an inner disk radius of @xmath70 km . the comptonized spectrum is probably produced in a spherical , hot ( @xmath5 kev ) region of moderate optical depth ( @xmath43 ) surrounding the neutron star .",
    "the soft seed photons for the comptonization , with a temperature @xmath44 kev , probably come from the neutron star surface and/or boundary layer .",
    "the presence of a reflection component is not detected with high statistical significance . to constrain the reflection parameters we used a self - consistent model that also calculates the iron line produced in the reflection .",
    "this is important because mxb 172834 was in a soft state during the bepposax observation and the low temperature of the primary emission significantly reduce the reflection bump between 20 and 40 kev . using this self - consistent model to fit the iron line , we find that the reflector is ionized and the reflection amplitude is @xmath10 .",
    "alternatively the iron line could be emitted in a strongly ionized corona .",
    "further observations are needed to clarify the origin of the iron line .",
    "the authors want to thank p.t . @xmath17ycki and c. done for kindly supplying their reflection model _ fe - refl _ and the comptonization model _ thcomp _ , and for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the italian space agency ( asi ) , by the ministero della ricerca scientifica e tecnologica ( murst ) .",
