    "a diamod doped with boron can become superconducting at temperatures of few kelvins @xcite .",
    "such critical temperatures are surprisingly high for impurity band conductivity .",
    "moreover , one can expect that @xmath4 will be soon further increased",
    ". it would be useful to predict an optimal sample composition from a microscopic theory .",
    "to this end we evaluate the density of states at the fermi level within the dynamical cluster approximation and show that it can be approximated by a simple power - law . using this density of states",
    "the @xmath4 can be predicted from a mcmillan type formula .",
    "diamond is an insulator with a band gap of @xmath5 .",
    "boron atoms create shallow acceptor levels close to the valence band with activation energy of holes @xmath6 . at a doping concentration above @xmath7",
    "the system presents a metal - insulator transition @xcite and might become superconducting at @xmath8  k. with increasing concentration @xmath4 increases .",
    "a favoured theory of superconductivity driving mechanism is , that electrons mostly interact with localized vibrational modes on the boron atoms in an optic spectra .",
    "however other possible theories are discussed as well @xcite .",
    "experimental data on boron doped diamond are controversial . majority of samples were prepared in thin layers and their properties strongly depend on crystallographic orientation of the surface .",
    "there are two widely studied types with @xmath9 and @xmath10 orientation , see references @xcite and @xcite , respectively .",
    "both groups have used the microwave plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition method though under different growth conditions .",
    "their samples differ in many characteristics including the @xmath4 .",
    "the @xmath10 samples have higher @xmath4 in general . in this paper",
    "we focus on the @xmath9 samples which are also supported by bulk samples prepared with the high temperature high pressure method @xcite revealing a comparable @xmath4 .",
    "the theory of boron - doped diamond can benefit from an extensive experience with superconductivity in disordered materials .",
    "@xcite unlike in metallic alloys , where the disorder mainly modifies the coherence length and can be handled within simple approximations , in the case of doping induced superconductivity a sophisticated treatment of the disorder is necessary to describe a formation of the impurity band .",
    "shirakawa @xcite have shown that a concentration dependence of @xmath4 measured in boron doped diamond can not be reproduced by the bcs theory in which the disorder is described on the level of the coherent potential approximation ( cpa ) .",
    "since this theory yields too low values of @xmath4 , they proposed that disorder effects beyond the cpa are responsible for this disagreement .",
    "we will show that corrections beyond the cpa do increase @xmath4 , however in the extent which is not sufficent to cover discrepancies in question .",
    "in the present paper we compute the density of states at the fermi energy level for boron doped diamond within the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) .",
    "while the cpa assumes a single atom embeded in the effective medium , the dca generalises this idea by embedding a cluster .",
    "the cluster allows us to describe splitting of closely located impurity bound states which contributes to the shape of the impurity band . with respect to the superconductivity it is essential that the density of states at the fermi level computed within the dca is higher than the cpa value .    apparently , the density of states at fermi level is much lower in the impurity band than in ordinary metals . since values of @xmath4 are comparable , the boron doped diamond belongs to the family of the strong coupling materials .",
    "one can expect large dicrepancies from the bcs theory and we will show , that this is indeed the case . in this paper",
    "we use the belitz theory @xcite which generalises the mcmillan formula to disordered superconductors .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we simplify the belitz theory so that it depends on the doping exclusively via the disorder dependent density of states . in sec .",
    "iii we evaluate the density of states within the dynamical cluster approximation .",
    "the coherent potential approximation is evaluated for comparision . in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the concentration dependence of the critical temperature comparing predictions of the belitz theory , the mcmillan formula and the bcs theory . to this end",
    "we first establish density independent material parameters with the help of which one can construct the density dependent coupling strength @xmath11 , the coulomb pseudopotential @xmath12 and the belitz correction @xmath13 .",
    "section v brings conclusions .",
    "let us outline the belitz theory , first . in the absence of currents , the eliashberg selfenergy has three terms @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the kinetic energy and @xmath16 is the matsubara frequency . for pure superconductors",
    "@xmath17 renormalised by @xmath18 gives a gap function @xmath19 while @xmath20 is a scalar that only shifts the chemical potential having no effect on the critical temperature .",
    "in disordered superconductors , parameter @xmath20 becomes energy and frequency dependent .",
    "belitz has shown that its energy derivative at fermi energy @xmath21 modifies the mcmillan formula as @xmath22 here @xmath11 describes an electron - phonon coupling and @xmath23 is the screened pseudopotential , in which @xmath12 characterises a strength of the coulomb interaction , @xmath24 is its effective range and @xmath25 is the debye frequency . setting @xmath26",
    "one recovers the mcmillan formula .",
    "in general , belitz formula includes four disorder dependent material parameters @xmath25 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 . based on ab - initio computations @xcite which show that @xmath25 changes negligibly with doping we ignore the disorder dependence of @xmath25 and use a pure diamond value @xmath27 .",
    "the strong disorder dependence of remaining parameters stems from a rapid variation of the density of states at the fermi energy level @xmath28 in vicinity of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "we will use a simplified version of the belitz theory neglecting disorder corrections to interaction vertices in perturbation series .",
    "this brings a significant reduction of numerical demands , because @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 reduce to functions of @xmath28 only .",
    "moreover , with the vertex correction neglected , @xmath29 so that we are left with @xmath11 and @xmath12 similarly as in the mcmillan theory .    we take @xmath11 from ab - initio computations .",
    "since the published results cover only few concentrations , we evaluate @xmath11 in the spirit of morel and anderson @xcite formula @xmath30 here @xmath31 represents a phonon - electron coupling strength and @xmath32 describes a screening .",
    "the pseudopotential @xmath12 reads @xcite @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the strength of the coulomb interaction .",
    "since we have found no measurement of @xmath34 in the literature , we have to treat it as a parameter which is set from experimental data .",
    "because in the boron - doped diamond the fermi energy level is localised very close to the top of the valence band we associate @xmath35 with the effective range of the coulombic interaction and estimate both as the distance of the fermi level from the top edge of the impurity band .",
    "the equation then has a simple form @xmath36    using formulas , and in and , we obtain @xmath4 as a function of @xmath2 .",
    "to proceed we have to establish @xmath28 as a function of the boron concentration @xmath2 .",
    "this single particle property is independent of the electron - electron interaction , would it be the coulomb repulsion or the phonon - mediated pairing potential .",
    "the density of states is thus given by a hamiltonian of the valence band in diamond @xmath37 and a random potential of boron impurities @xmath38 in the random potential @xmath39 at impurity sites and zero elsewhere , and @xmath40 is the potential amplitude .",
    "we note that this single - site s - type potential does not cover the triple degeneracy of impurity state of boron .",
    "we adopt this hamiltonian already studied by shirakawa @xcite to make a link between their and present results .",
    "we have evaluated @xmath1 within the dca for clusters of @xmath41 atoms on a cubic lattice . compared to the cpa density of states employed by shirakawa ,",
    "our cluster density of states includes nontrivial corrections given by bonding and anti - bonding states at neighbour impurity sites .",
    "difference between the cpa and dca density of states in the impurity band is ilustrated in figure  [ fig0_dos ] for 5%  of boron doping .    within the cpa ( dashed line ) the impurity band yields rather featureless density of states having a slightly skewed semieliptic shape .",
    "the valence band starts approximately at an energy of @xmath42  ev and ends at @xmath43  ev .",
    "we focus on the impurity band because the fermi energy , @xmath44 , lies there . since boron is an acceptor , its bound states have higher energy than extended states in a valence band .    in the dca ( solid line )",
    "one can distinguish additional contributions of two and three boron clusters .",
    "clusters of four to eight borons are also included , but their contributions are invisible for the given concentration . the main part of the impurity band density of states is formed by a bound state on a single boron . a shoulder on the right side of the impurity band results from a symmetric bound state of two neighbouring borons . the nonsymmetric state is not bounded but forms a resonant state visible in the valence band .",
    "the tree boron bound state is splited off at an energy @xmath45  ev .",
    "higher states of the three boron clusters make a negligible contribution .    with respect to superconductivity",
    "the fermi energy region is the most important .",
    "as one can see the density of states at @xmath44 is dominated by the single boron states .",
    "this is a reason why the cpa and dca give comparable @xmath1 .",
    "the resulting density of states at the fermi level @xmath1 is presented in figure  [ fig1_n ] .",
    "for comparison we also show the cpa result .",
    "one can see that the dca density of states is higher than the cpa value at all impurity concentrations .",
    "both resulting densities with a good accuracy obey power - law , @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "a very good approximation by power - law also holds for the distance of the fermi level from the top of the impurity band , @xmath48 for the dca . in the rest of this section we provide more details of our computation .",
    "the reader not interested in these technical details can skip to the next section .",
    "we only briefly introduce the dca here , the reader can find all details in reference  @xcite .",
    "a basic idea of the dynamical cluster approximation is to divide the brillouin zone into subzones  in our case @xmath41 subzones . within the subzone",
    "the selfenergy is momentum - independent , i.e. , the selfenergy is represented by eight complex functions of frequency . by symmetry arguments",
    "this number can be reduced to four functions .",
    "all subzones contribute to the density of states @xmath49 where @xmath50 is a subzone index .",
    "in general , the subzone contribution @xmath51 is obtained integrating over the subzone with the electron dispersion of the valence band . for simplicity",
    "we approximate these functions by a semielliptical distribution with a proper width , shift and normalisation @xmath52 where @xmath53 is number of subzones ( 8 in our case ) , and @xmath54 are width and center of subzone energy bands with @xmath55 and @xmath56 being the maximum and minimum energy in the subzone @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the density of states by definition maintains the width of the valence band .",
    "since one of the subzones is centered around the @xmath57 point of the brillouine zone , this approximation also yields a correct curvature at the edge , i.e. , it correctly reproduces an effective mass of holes near the band edge .",
    "this feature is vital for a realistic description of the relatively shallow impurity state .",
    "we employ the model valence band in the cpa as well .",
    "the parameters of the hamiltonian are fitted according to the facts that the valence band is @xmath58 wide and the single impurity bound state appears at energy @xmath59 above the valence one . using the local green function corresponding the density of states , we come to @xmath60  ev .    we determine the fermi energy level from a condition for a local averaged density of electrons at zero temperature @xmath61 .",
    "we are aware that a measured number of charge carriers can differ significantly from a number deduced from the concentration of boron atoms in the sample .",
    "as has recently been pointed out by mukuda @xcite quite a large fraction of boron atoms can form the neutral b - h complexes , reducing the concentration of charge carriers . on",
    "the other hand klein @xcite found that the effective number of carriers deduced from hall - effect measurements was much larger than the number of boron atoms in samples .",
    "since the charge carrier concentrations for all samples are not accessible we assume for simplicity the films to be doped ideally .",
    "in this section we discuss the concentration dependence of the critical temperature @xmath0 . to be able to implement the belitz theory",
    "we need the coupling strength @xmath11 and the pseudopotential @xmath12 as functions of @xmath1 .",
    "the coupling strength @xmath11 we deduce from ab - initio computations . in literature one",
    "finds the studies within the virtual crystal approximation @xcite and the supercell method @xcite . in figure  [ fig3_l ]",
    "we show fit of ab - initio results by formula .",
    "we found that parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 yield a reasonable fit of rather scattered computed values .",
    "it remains to establish the pseudopotential . according to formula we have to find a single parameter @xmath34 , which determines @xmath12 for all concentrations .",
    "dots in figure  [ fig4_mu ] show values of @xmath12 deduced from the belitz theory and experimental values of @xmath0 .",
    "one can see that all dots stay close to a line given by formula with @xmath64 .",
    "the parameter @xmath34 holds for all concentrations and it is the only material parameter fitted to experimental values of @xmath0 in the present theory .",
    "now all relations and parameters are ready for predictions of the critical temperature .",
    "the concentration dependence of @xmath0 given by the belitz formula and power - law approximation of the dca value of @xmath1 is shown in figure  [ fig5_t ] .",
    "as one can see , the theory describes a steep increase of @xmath0 with doping at the region of small concentrations . at higher concentrations the critical tempeture satures at about 3 k. this saturation reminds trends described by the theory of osofsky @xcite based on a heuristic rescaling of the bcs parameters .    for comparison",
    "we also show the value predicted by the belitz theory for the cpa density of states .",
    "as one expects from the lower density of states , the cpa leads to lower values of @xmath4 , namely in the region of small concentrations .",
    "our results thus confirm a trend predicted by shirakawa that corrections beyond the cpa will lead to higher @xmath4 .",
    "we would like to emphasis that the disorder corrections by belitz are necessary for a good agreement between experimental data and theory .",
    "it can be seen from attempt to the fit @xmath4 with the mcmillan formula as shown in figure  [ fig5_t ] . in the comparison",
    "we have not used the pseudopotential @xmath12 fitted within the belitz theory , but made a seprate fit directly from the mcmillan formula , see figure  [ fig4_mu ] .",
    "finally we show that the boron - doped diamond has to be treated as a strong coupling superconductor . in figure  [ fig2_bcs ]",
    "we show @xmath9 experimental @xmath4 data and its description with the bcs formula @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the bcs interaction .",
    "apparently , the bcs theory yields an incorrect concentration dependence .",
    "it is noteworthy how much the corrections beyond the cpa increase @xmath0 within the bcs theory . in the strong coupling theory",
    "these corrections are smaller by an order of magnitude .",
    "to conclude we have discussed corrections beyond the cpa to the critical temperature in diamond doped with boron . from numerical studies of the dynamical cluster approximation with cluster of @xmath41 atoms it follows that these corrections increase the density of states at fermi level .",
    "as expected this causes an increase of the critical temperature . comparing different approximations",
    "we have shown that the strong coupling theory is necessary to predict realistic critical temperature .",
    "it also turns out that disorder corrections of belitz improve agreement with experimental data .",
    "the present theory offers a simple analytic formula for the critical temperature as a function of boron density .",
    "indeed , in a simplified belitz theory all material parameters depend exclusively on the density of states and can be expressed as its linear or rational functions .",
    "numerical studies of @xmath67 show that the density of states at the fermi level follows a power - law @xmath68 , what allows one to predict the critical temperature without any numerical effort .",
    "author would like to thank pavel lipavsk ' y for many useful discussions and also to j. h. samson for a critical reading of the manuscript .",
