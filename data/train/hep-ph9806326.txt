    "<S> such an irfp [ analogous to the naive irfp @xmath43 described at the beginning of this letter ] is of questionable validity because of the large magnitude of the dominant @xmath44 term immediately preceding truncation [ 7 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> such truncation difficulties are averted if the known coefficients @xmath36 and the estimated coefficient @xmath20 are utilized to generate a @xmath0 $ ] pad approximant that reproduces @xmath45 as the first five terms of its infinite maclaurin series . </S>",

    "<S> if @xmath72 , we see that @xmath73 and @xmath74 . </S>",

    "<S> thus , no matter what @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) is eventually found to be , the @xmath2 $ ] pad approximant whose maclaurin expansion matches the @xmath78 terms of the @xmath4-function will not support the existence of any positive irfps ; zeros of this approximant all correspond to uvfps . as is evident from fig . </S>",
    "<S> 2 , the structure of the @xmath2 $ ] approximant to the @xmath4-function ( 2 ) decouples the ir - region entirely from coupling - constant evolution between uvfps  _ i.e. _ if @xmath79 is between zero and @xmath61 , @xmath80 can not be smaller than @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> finally we note that the existence of a uvfp different from zero [ necessarily leading to a double - valued function for @xmath82 could indicate an additional strong - coupling phase of qcd at short distances [ 9 ] , with possible implications for dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking . </S>",
