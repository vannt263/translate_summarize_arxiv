    "this time reversal operation guarantees that the eigenvalues are real and come in positive and negative pairs .",
    "there is also one pair of eigenvalues which are zero .",
    "these eigenvalues correspond to the gross - pitaevskii solutions , and are not in this case interesting since they do not represent any oscillations .",

    "we now consider the case where we have spherically symmetric trapping potentials with @xmath34 . the coupled eqs .",
    "( [ ggp ] ) and ( [ bdg ] ) are then considerably simplified . in that case , the obvious and simplest way to solve the bogoliubov - de gennes equations ( [ bdg ] ) is to discretize the solutions and the derivatives .",
    "this method works well if the problem can be reduced to one dimension .",
    "thus the radial part is solved for , which means that we can only see the so called breathing modes @xcite of the condensates . when discretizing the solutions @xmath35 and the derivatives we get an eigenvalue problem @xmath36 with @xmath37 the eigenvalue problem then concerns a matrix of size @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of gridpoints used to build up the eigensolutions .",

    "this crude fourier method , where an initial state which slightly differs from the ground state is chosen , works in the spirit of kicking the condensates and letting them ring .",
    "it gives us the spectrum in one go but it is not very accurate since we have used only 50 gridpoints in the densities .",
    "it is not obvious how to get a good spectrum with this method whithout greatly increasing the computing work .",
    "increasing the grid to one hundred points has been found to give better agreement with the method in sec .",

    "another approach to calculating the eigenvalue spectrum is to follow the response of the system to an external driving force @xcite .",

    "we can then follow the response of the condensate densities as functions of the driving frequency @xmath42 by fourier transforming the corresponding changes in the densities as explained above .",

    "the spectrum is seen to display avoided crossings between @xmath46 and @xmath51 or @xmath52 and @xmath53 around @xmath54 .",
    "the discrete points given in fig.1 derive from the response of the kicked condensate as described in sec . iii.b .",
    "as explained there , the results are not very accurate but serve as an overall check on the spectrum .",
    "we found , that choosing a typical initial state to be the gross - pitaevskii solution with @xmath25 slightly shifted @xmath55 gives the best spectrum for levels up to @xmath56 . with this method",
    "it is possible to detect the four lowest frequencies without any major inaccuracy ; for higher frequencies the agreement is less satisfactory .",
    "the solution of the time dependent gross - pitaevskii equations have to be computed for long times in order to get a high resolution spectrum .",
    "this was done with the grid method as explained earlier .",
    "the results from the fourier method shown in figs.[spec1]-[spec3 ] used fifty gridpoints in the density .",
    "this gives stable iterations and allows us to solve for long times .",

    "we see that the frequencies obtained uniformly tend to approach the results from the secular equations .",

    "we see the dramatic increase of the magnitude of the response when @xmath42 is changed from @xmath60 to the resonance value @xmath61 .",
    "as this calculation has been done in the region near the avoided crossing , we find the same frequency nearly equally strong in the fourier transforms of either condensate ( to the right in fig .",

    "if we compare these amplitudes with the densities of the condensates , fig .",
    "[ tva ] , we find that condensate 1 has no oscillational amplitudes after @xmath71 , because the density goes to zero",
    ". the condensate 2 reaches out to about @xmath72 because it is repelled by condensate 1 .",

    "the frequencies calculated with the fourier methods are less satisfactory as compared with the bdg - spectrum .",
    "unfortunately , it is very easy to excite harmonic generations in the vicinity of level @xmath56 and @xmath82 , which makes it difficult to find the eigenfrequencies for levels higher than @xmath56 .",
    "this may also explain the lack of improvement in @xmath81 over @xmath80 at these frequencies .",
    "we have generalized the bogoliubov - de gennes method to the case of two coupled condensates .",
    "the ensuing eigenvalues are solved for the spherically symmetric excitations , the breathing modes .",
    "the calculations are numerically demanding , and obtaining the full spectrum in this way seems to be beyond the numerical capacity of our approach .",
    "we have also started from a symmetric ground state , even if we know that the condensates may separate due to symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "this we have done mainly for numerical reasons , but our investigations of the condensate stability indicate that the range of interaction we are mainly interested in here , @xmath83 , may lead to stable condensates located on top of each other .",
    "we report on these results in a separate communication @xcite .",
    "we have used time dependent integrations to check the behaviour of the energy eigenvalues in an indenpendent way .",
    "starting from a perturbed state , the system evolution should contain all the eigenfrequencies of the system ; here they are restricted to the symmetric ones of course .",
    "the advantage of this method is that a fourier transform brings out all frequencies at the same time .",
