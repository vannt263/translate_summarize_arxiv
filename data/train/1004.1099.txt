    "there is increasing evidence that active galactic nuclei ( agns ) have an important role to play in the formation and evolution of galaxies via agn - driven feedback .",
    "various relationships exist between the central black hole of an agn and the stellar population of the galaxy : for example , the relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion ( @xmath1-@xmath2 ) ( gebhardt et al . 2000 ; ferrarese & merritt 2000 ; merritt & ferrarese 2001 ; gltekin et al .",
    "2009 ) and the relation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity ( e.g. mclure & dunlop 2001 ; mclure & dunlop 2002 ; gltekin et al .",
    "the latter may also be expressed as the magorrian relation between black hole mass and bulge stellar mass ( magorrian et al .",
    "these tight correlations provide compelling evidence for links between galaxy formation and evolution and the growth of black holes through agn ( accretion ) activity .",
    "one suggested mechanism is that of quasar outflows limiting black hole masses , dependent on the depth of the potential wells of dark matter halos ( silk & rees 1998 ) .",
    "the current models of galaxy formation and evolution also invoke agn - driven feedback to halt the overproduction of stars in the most massive galaxies .",
    "for example , croton et al .",
    "( 2006 ) include agn - driven feedback phenomena in their semi - analytic model , separated into `` quasar - mode '' ( associated with the efficient accretion of cold gas ) and `` radio - mode '' ( associated with the less efficient accretion of warm gas ) feedback .",
    "sijacki et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also include agn - driven feedback in their full hydrodynamical model , once again separated into two modes : the `` quasar regime '' ( corresponding to central black holes with high accretion rates ) and mechanical feedback ( corresponding to central black holes with low accretion rates ) .",
    "studying the host galaxies of radio - loud agn should therefore enable us to place important constraints on the validity of the feedback mechanisms in the models .",
    "one method of investigating the cold- and hot - mode accretion in agns is with radio samples .",
    "selecting agns on the basis of their low - frequency radio emission enables the selection of type-2 , or obscured agns , in the same way as radio - loud quasars .",
    "this is because the radio waves are unaffected by dust obscuration , and the radio emission from the extended lobes is optically thin and therefore orientation independent .",
    "furthermore , selecting the type-2 radio - loud quasars , or radio galaxies , allows the study of the stellar populations in the agn host galaxy , as the central nuclear emission is obscured by the putative dusty torus invoked in unified schemes ( e.g. antonucci 1993 ; hill , goodrich & depoy 1996 ) .",
    "we also note that in the lower power agns this optical faintness may arise not merely from obscuration , but also from an inherent lack of bright optical - uv continua due to the absence of an accretion disc ( e.g. chiaberge , capetti & celotti 1999 ) .",
    "the obscuration - related optical faintness in powerful agn has enabled many authors to study the evolution of their host galaxies , with most work based on the near - infrared ( @xmath3 ) hubble diagram ( lilly & longair 1982 ; jarvis et al . 2001 ; willott et al . 2003 ) and broad - band colours ( e.g. lilly 1989 ) suggesting that the hosts of powerful radio galaxies are comprised of an old stellar population which forms at high redshift ( @xmath4 ) and then passively evolves .",
    "radio galaxies are commonly classified by their radio morphologies into fanaroff - riley type i ( fri ) and fanaroff - riley type ii ( frii ) classes ( fanaroff & riley 1974 ) .",
    "an alternative division is that introduced by hine & longair ( 1979 ) based on optical spectra into high excitation galaxies ( hegs ) and low excitation galaxies ( legs ) ; this was further refined by laing et al .",
    "( 1994 ) and jackson & rawlings ( 1997 ) who classified 3cr radio galaxies on this basis ( see section  [ specclass ] ) .",
    "there is increasing evidence that this emission line classification scheme , rather than the fr - class , has a direct link to the accretion mode of the agn .",
    "hardcastle , evans & croston ( 2007 ) showed that bondi accretion of the hot phase of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) is sufficient to power all low excitation radio sources , whereas the hegs are powered by the accretion of cold gas typically thought to be driven towards the central engine during a galaxy merger .",
    "there are , however , other theories for the origin of the accreted cold gas in these galaxies . for example , in the hydrodynamical model of ciotti & ostriker ( 2007 ) , gas from dying stars can be recycled by cooling radiatively and falling to the nuclear region where a small fraction ( @xmath5 or less ) is accreted onto the central black hole . alternatively , various authors ( kere et al . 2005 ; dekel & birnboim 2006 ; ocvirk , pichon & teyssier 2008 ; dekel et al .",
    "2009 ; brooks et al . 2009 ; kere et al .",
    "2009 ) have used hydrodynamic simulations to show that cold mode accretion via streams or filaments of cold gas could be responsible for the majority of the gas supplied to massive galaxies at high redshifts . for lower mass galaxies this cold mode accretion could be the dominant source of cold gas right up to the present day .    following on from earlier work by lilly & longair ( 1984 ) ,",
    "baldi & capetti ( 2008 ) studied a sample of nearby 3cr radio galaxies and compared optical and uv images in order to detect evidence of recent star formation .",
    "they found evidence of recent star formation in the hegs in their sample , but not in the legs .",
    "they suggest that the hegs have undergone recent major mergers which both trigger star formation and power the agn by providing a supply of cold gas for accretion .",
    "the legs in their picture , which supports the one put forward by hardcastle et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , have experienced no such mergers . in this case",
    "no bursts of star formation are triggered and the agn are powered by accretion of the hot interstellar medium ( ism ) .    in complementary work , emonts et al .",
    "( 2008 ) find no evidence for large - scale hi structures in the host galaxies of fri - type sources , but find that the host galaxies of most of the frii - type sources in their sample contain significant amounts of hi .",
    "they suggest that this dichotomy is a result of different formation histories for fri and frii - type radio sources .",
    "this is again consistent with the picture outlined above in which high- and low - luminosity radio galaxies have undergone different star formation histories and this also influences the mode of accretion on to the central supermassive black hole .    in recent work using the vast data set available from the sloan digital sky survey , kauffmann , heckman & best ( 2008 ) study a sample of radio - loud agns with emission lines .",
    "they find a strong correlation between the presence of emission lines and the presence of a young stellar population , consistent with the findings of baldi & capetti ( 2008 ) .",
    "they also find a correlation between the age of the stellar population and the radio luminosity normalised by the black hole mass .",
    "they note that strong optical agns have a significantly enhanced probability of hosting radio jets , and thus the radio and optical phenomena are not independent .",
    "however , although the sdss is a wide - area survey , it does not probe the necessary volume to obtain a significant sample of the more luminous frii - type or heg populations .",
    "therefore , in order to study these effects further , we need to use a complete sample of radio sources selected by other methods .",
    "in this paper we present the results of our study into the star formation histories ( sfhs ) of 24 radio galaxies at @xmath6 .",
    "we compare our 4000  break indices with radio luminosity , spectral classification and morphological classification .",

    "mindful of this note of caution , it is still readily apparent that the galaxies form two distinct populations .",

    "( 2008 ) and baldi & capetti ( 2008 ) .",
    "the latter authors find evidence of recent star formation in hegs but not in legs .",
    "they suggest that hegs have undergone a recent major merger that triggered star formation and also provided the fuel to power the agn via cold gas accretion . in their picture ,",
    "legs on the other hand have had no such recent merger , and thus are fuelled by the hot ism and show no evidence of recent star formation . however , whilst mergers seem a likely explanation of the origin of the influx of cold gas in hegs , we note that there are alternative explanations of this influx , as discussed in section [ intro ] .",
    "we also note that our population that shows evidence of more recent star formation contains three ( or possibly four ) legs .",
    "thus a spectral line classification system may not be a clean method to study the history of the influx of cold gas into agn hosts  rather the star formation history measured by studying the host galaxies may offer a better indication of the past influx of cold gas by mergers or other processes .    however , it is possible that even when the principal accretion mechanism is through the hot - mode , minor mergers and interactions could stimulate some star - formation activity which would result in smaller d@xmath13(4000 ) values .",
    "furthermore , the timescale on which a merger influences the agn fuelling could be different from the timescale on which it triggers star formation which would also cause mixing of the populations .",
    "it is also interesting to note that the legs still have amongst the oldest stellar populations in the higher radio luminosity population .",

    "an important question is whether the dichotomy observed in d@xmath13(4000 ) is primarily related to the radio luminosity ( section [ d4000radlum ] ) or to the excitation state ( this section ) .",

    "however , there is a great deal of mixing of the radio morphology types , and we find no clear difference between the two populations on the basis of radio morphology * alone * due to the strong relation between radio morphology classification and the high- and low - excitation populations ( hine & longair 1979 )",

    "( 1985 ) , we would expect the contamination by scattered quasar light to be highly correlated with the ionizing power of the central engine and thus the emission - line luminosity , assuming emission - line luminosity is a good proxy for ionizing power ( see e.g. rawlings & saunders 1991 ) .",
    "however , we find no evidence for a correlation between the [ oii ] luminosity and d@xmath13(4000 ) with a spearman rank test giving only a 25 per cent probability that the relation deviates from the null hypothesis of no correlation . furthermore , for scattered quasar light to have a large effect on our results would require a very strong dependence on wavelength , i.e. over the range where we calculate d@xmath13(4000 ) . using the most pronounced examples of scattered quasar light in the literature , i.e. in broad - line radio galaxies ( see e.g. tran et al .",
    "1998 ) we find , by using the total polarized emission spectrum from these sources , that the spectrum of the scattered light gives a value of d@xmath13(4000)@xmath49 .",
    "assuming that at 3900  up to 10 per cent of the total emission in our radio galaxies could be contributed by the scattered nuclear emission ( e.g. figure 3 of tran et al .",
    "1998 ) we calculate that this would reduce our d@xmath13(4000 ) by a maximum value of 0.1 .",
    "given that none of our radio galaxy spectra show any evidence for any scattered contribution , have pronounced absorption - line spectra and are all well fit by a simple stellar population , along with the lack of a correlation between [ oii ] emission - line luminosity and d@xmath13(4000 ) , we are confident that the dichotomy in d@xmath13(4000 ) between the hegs and legs is due to different star - formation histories rather than scattered quasar light .",
    "in this paper we have used deep spectroscopic observations to determine how the age of the stellar populations in the host galaxies of powerful radio sources is related to the structure of the radio emission and the ionizing power of the agn .",
    "* we have shown that our sample of @xmath0 radio galaxies forms two distinct populations in the d@xmath13(4000 ) - l@xmath12 plane . the population at lower radio luminosity is composed entirely of legs , the one at higher radio luminosity predominantly of hegs ( although a few legs fall within this population ) . *",
    "our lower radio luminosity population has systematically higher d@xmath13(4000 ) indices than the higher radio luminosity population .",
    "we find that this is most likely due to the presence of a younger stellar population in the higher radio luminosity ( or heg ) population after considering the possibility that scattered quasar light may significantly alter the d@xmath13(4000 ) .",
    "we find that scattered quasar light could only decrease d@xmath13(4000 ) by a maximum value of 0.1 , which is not sufficient to explain the dichotomy that we observe .",
    "however , we are unable to measure the h@xmath38 for our objects , which does leave some uncertainty in determining the actual extent of the star formation in our galaxies . *",
    "we find that there is a preference for `` fat - double '' sources to have older stellar populations than the `` classical double '' sources .",
    "however , this may simply reflect the underlying links between morphology and excitation state or radio morphology , which appear to be more strongly correlated with d@xmath13(4000 ) than is the morphology . *",
    "our results are consistent with the hypothesis that hegs are powered by the accretion of cold gas , the influx of which could be due to mergers  which would also trigger star formation  or other processes , such as cooled , recycled gas from dying stars or cold mode accretion . on the other hand , we suggest that legs are powered by the accretion of the hot phase of the inter - stellar medium ( as they have undergone no recent influx of cold gas ) .",
    "the results presented here show that deep optical spectroscopy can provide important information on the host galaxy properties of moderate redshift , powerful radio galaxies .",
    "however , this also needs to be linked to other indicators of star formation and merger activity to obtain a comprehensive and consistent explanation for the observed differences between agn and their corresponding effect on the evolution of massive galaxies .    in future work",
    "( herbert et al . in preparation ) we will use this sample to investigate where these radio sources fall on the fundamental plane and how they relate to the general massive galaxy population .",
    "furthermore , we also have deep multi - band imaging data to assess the environmental richness of the full @xmath0 sample which will enable us to link how the power of the agn , its host galaxy mass and star formation history are related to the environmental density of the agn .",
