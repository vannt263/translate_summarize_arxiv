    "the emission of photons accompanying the coulomb interaction of charged particles is well explained by classical electrodynamics .",
    "the strength of the electromagnetic radiation is proportional to the acceleration which the charged particle experiences in an external field . in order to study bremsstrahlung emission accompanying alpha decay in nuclei",
    ", however , one needs to go beyond the classical picture where an alpha particle is accelerated in the coulomb field of the daughter nucleus .",
    "in contrast to the photon emission accompanying nuclear beta decay , the photons in alpha decay can also be emitted during the quantum tunneling process .",
    "the natural question that arises is therefore : do the @xmath1 particles emit radiation during tunneling or do they emit only in their acceleration outside the barrier ?",
    "this curiosity gave rise to experiments measuring the emission probabilities of photons in the alpha decay of @xmath2po @xcite , @xmath0po @xcite , @xmath3ra @xcite and @xmath4cu @xcite .",
    "however , with the emission probabilities being small and the experiments difficult to perform , there remained discrepancies in data .",
    "the theoretical calculations trying to explain these data also saw a similar fate .",
    "for example , the authors in @xcite used an existing theoretical approach @xcite based on a semi - classical calculation of the tunneling motion through the barrier and found very good agreement with their data . a repetition of the same calculation in a different manner @xcite ,",
    "however , generated qualitatively different results . in @xcite , within a fully quantum mechanical approach , the authors found that the main contribution to photon emission arose from coulomb acceleration and the under barrier tunneling contribution was tiny .",
    "the authors in @xcite however concluded that the total contribution results from a subtle interference of the tunneling , mixed and classical regions .",
    "different aspects of this process , such as a time dependent description @xcite , the  interference of space regions \" @xcite , analysis of angular bremsstrahlung spectra @xcite , the dynamic characteristics such as the position , velocity and acceleration of the @xmath1 particle @xcite , contribution of quadrupole radiation @xcite etc have also been studied . however , with the lack of data , the discrepancies in the understanding of the bremsstrahlung emission in alpha decay remain .",
    "the present work attempts to analyze some of the issues with a new semi - classical approach based on tunneling times .    in the next section , after a brief introduction to the time concepts used in the present work , we shall present a semi - classical model to evaluate the photon emission probabilities in alpha decay .",
    "in particular we consider the case of alpha decay in @xmath0po . though some of the theoretical approaches in literature perform a fully quantum mechanical treatment of the problem , not much attention is paid to the details of the nuclear potential .",
    "we present results displaying the sensitivity of the calculations to the nuclear potential used , the necessity of including an alpha cluster preformation factor and the role of the under barrier and outside the barrier acceleration of the alpha particle .",
    "finally , before summarising our results , we present a section with a critical view of the various theoretical approaches available .",
    "tunneling is one of the most remarkable phenomenon of quantum physics .",
    "interesting is also the question of how long does a particle take to traverse the barrier .",
    "the latter indeed gave rise to several quantum time concepts such as the phase , dwell , traversal and larmor time @xcite .",
    "with the availability of so many definitions ( which some times even include complex times @xcite ) , it is of interest to inspect which of these times could correspond to physically measured quantities .",
    "the stationary concepts of dwell time and traversal time do find a connection with measurable quantities , with the former giving the half life of radioactive nuclei and the latter the inverse of the assault frequency in alpha particle tunneling @xcite .",
    "it is these two concepts which we shall use below in developing a semi - classical model for bremsstrahlung in alpha decay . before going over to the model",
    ", we briefly introduce the two concepts .",
    "given an arbitrary potential barrier @xmath5 in one - dimension ( a framework which is also suitable for spherically symmetric problems ) , confined to an interval @xmath6 , the dwell time is given by the number of particles in the region divided by the incident flux @xmath7 : @xmath8 here @xmath9 is the time independent solution of the schrdinger equation in the given region .",
    "the dwell time is usually defined as the time spent in the region @xmath6 regardless of how the particle escaped ( by reflection or transmission ) and @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 with @xmath12 being the kinetic energy of the tunneling particle and @xmath13 the reduced mass ) for a free particle . in case that one defines the dwell time for a particle bound in a region which either got transmitted or reflected later , the flux @xmath7 gets replaced by the transmitted or reflected fluxes , @xmath14 and @xmath15 @xcite respectively . here @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the transmission and reflection coefficients ( with @xmath18 due to conservation of probability ) .",
    "the traversal time defined by bttiker @xcite is somewhat different and is given as , @xmath19 where , @xmath20 .",
    "given the number of theoretical works which have appeared on this subject over the years ( as listed in the introduction too ) the question that probably comes to the reader s mind here is : why are we proposing yet another model ?",
    "we therefore begin by stating the reasons for such an undertaking . to start with ,",
    "( i ) the quantum time concepts were successfully applied to realistic examples in nuclear and particle physics such as locating particle resonances @xcite , eta - mesic nuclear states @xcite , half lives of heavy nuclei and even in other branches like atomic , semiconductor physics , chemistry and biology ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "it is certainly interesting to extend these concepts to an intriguing phenomenon in nuclear physics .",
    "( ii ) the quantum mechanical treatments are based on the evaluation of the transition matrix involving integrals where a separation of the space regions before , within and after the barrier where the photon could have been emitted is not so obvious . besides , while some papers simply use a rectangular well nuclear potential @xcite , others exclude the inner ( nuclear potential ) region from the integration @xcite .",
    "the present work will use a realistic nuclear potential ( with a double folding model of nuclear densities and the m3y nucleon - nucleon interaction @xcite ) and verify the role of emission in the various spatial regions .",
    "( iii ) another new input is that the alpha - daughter cluster preformation probability is incorporated in the calculation and found to be important .",
    "we begin by defining an average velocity of the particle between points @xmath21 and @xmath22 as @xmath23 with the wave function being stationary and hence the density @xmath24 being time independent , the continuity equation is @xmath25 and the current density @xmath7 is constant in the one dimensional problem . identifying @xmath26 in the above equation , @xmath27 given the fact that we are interested in only those events where the alpha particle was transmitted through the barrier , we choose the constant flux @xmath7 to be the transmitted flux @xmath14 . in a semi - classical picture one could consider @xmath28 as the distance travelled by the particle while it spent the time @xmath29 in that region . coming back to the alpha - nucleus potential one could then write this distance as the one between the classical turning points times the number of assaults , @xmath30 , made by the particle before leaving that region .",
    "for example , for the potential with the classical turning points @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 defined by @xmath34 ( where @xmath12 is the energy of the tunneling particle ) , the frequency of assaults at the barrier , @xmath35 , can be written as the inverse of the time required to traverse the distance back and forth between the turning points @xmath31 and @xmath32 as @xcite , @xmath36^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] which is the inverse of twice the traversal time ( [ travtime ] ) from @xmath31 to @xmath32 . the number of assaults made by the alpha in region i is then , @xmath37 . with @xmath38 , @xmath39 replacing for @xmath28 with @xmath40 in ( [ avevel ] ) for region",
    "i and similarly with @xmath41 for region ii , the average velocity in regions i and ii can be finally written as @xmath42 the velocity in region iii , @xmath43 is simply the free velocity and is given by @xmath44 . defining the times at the turning points @xmath32 and @xmath33 as @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively",
    ", the velocity function can be written as @xmath47 where the step function @xmath48 is unity for all @xmath49 and zero otherwise . the classical formula for the photon emission probability in alpha decay",
    "is given as @xcite , @xmath50 where @xmath51 and we have introduced a factor @xmath52 in order to account for the alpha cluster preformation probability .",
    "@xmath53 is the effective charge for dipole transitions and is given as @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the mass and atomic numbers of the daughter nucleus .",
    "for example , @xmath53 = 0.4 for @xmath0po decay . replacing for the velocity from ( [ fullvel ] ) in ( [ aomega ] )",
    "we obtain , @xmath57 \\ , e^{-i\\omega t_2}\\,+ \\ , [ v_{iii}(q - \\hbar \\omega ) - v_{ii } ( q)]\\ , e^{-i\\omega t_3}\\ ] ] where we have written the energy dependence of the velocities explicitly .",
    "@xmath58 is the @xmath58-value of the decay and @xmath59 is the energy of the emitted photon .",
    "this dependence appears due to the fact that energy conservation has to be respected ( neglecting however the tiny recoil of the nucleus ) .",
    "the energy in @xmath43 should actually be @xmath60 , however , for all practical purposes , this does not lead to a big difference in the results . @xmath46 and @xmath45 define the times at which the particle enters and leaves the barrier .",
    "we choose @xmath61 in the interference term to be the traversal time in the barrier .",
    "thus for a given alpha - nucleus potential , the velocities and hence @xmath62 can be calculated from the traversal times .",
    "evaluating the dwell times ( and hence half life ) @xcite , the preformation factor is fixed ( see the discussion below ) and finally the emission probability is determined from ( [ prob ] ) .      starting with the standard definition of the wkb decay width @xcite , @xmath63^{-1}\\,e^{-2\\int_{r_2}^{r_3}\\ , \\kappa(r)\\,dr } \\ , , \\ ] ] where , @xmath64 and @xmath65 , the half life of the nucleus can be evaluated to be @xmath66 .",
    "the factor @xmath52 is determined by comparing the experimental half life of the nucleus with the theoretical one .",
    "the potential , @xmath67 , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the nuclear and coulomb parts of the @xmath1-nucleus ( daughter ) potential , @xmath70 the distance between the centres of mass of the daughter nucleus and alpha and @xmath13 their reduced mass .",
    "the last term represents the langer modified centrifugal barrier @xcite . with the wkb being valid for one - dimensional problems ,",
    "the above modification from @xmath71 is essential to ensure the correct behaviour of the wkb scattered radial wave function near the origin as well as the validity of the connection formulas used @xcite .",
    "another requisite for the correct use of the wkb method is the bohr - sommerfeld quantization condition , which for an alpha with energy @xmath12 is given as , @xmath72 where @xmath73 and @xmath74 is the number of nodes of the quasibound wave function of @xmath1-nucleus relative motion .",
    "the number of nodes are re - expressed as @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is a global quantum number obtained from fits to data @xcite .",
    "we choose @xmath77 for the @xmath0po calculations .",
    "the folded nuclear potential is written as , @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the densities of the alpha and the daughter nucleus in a decay and @xmath81 is the nucleon - nucleon interaction .",
    "@xmath82 is the distance between a nucleon in the alpha and a nucleon in the daughter nucleus .",
    "@xmath83 is written using the m3y nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) interaction as in @xcite .",
    "the coulomb potential is obtained using a similar double folding procedure @xcite with the matter densities of the alpha and the daughter replaced by their respective charge density distributions @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "the photon emission probabilities evaluated within the semi - classical tunneling time model are presented in figure 1 for the alpha decay of the nucleus @xmath0po .",
    "one can see that the contribution to the results from the acceleration at the beginning of the coulomb barrier ( dashed line ) is much larger than the acceleration while leaving the barrier ( dot - dashed line ) .",
    "the shape of the total emission probability ( solid line ) however gets decided by the sum and interference of the two terms .",
    "the disagreement with data ( which as such also disagree with each other having three different slopes ) at high energies could either be a limitation of the semi - classical model or due to the energy dependence of the cluster preformation factor ( which in the present work has been chosen to be constant ) .",
    "it is also important to note that we obtain @xmath52=0.03 on comparing the experimental and theoretical half lives of @xmath0po and this factor is essential to reproduce the right order of magnitude of the photon emission probability .",
    "emission probabilities for bremsstrahlung accompanying the @xmath1 decay of @xmath0po .",
    "the data are from refs .",
    "@xcite.,width=340,height=340 ]    in order to test the sensitivity of the results to the potential used , in figure 2 we display the results evaluated using the realistic potential @xmath86 mentioned in the previous section and a simpler potential of the form , @xmath87 \\theta(r - r_0 ) \\ , -\\ , v_0 \\theta(r_0 - r)$ ] where",
    "@xmath88 and @xmath89 are chosen to take the values used in @xcite for @xmath0po . using @xmath90 mev and @xmath91 fm as in @xcite and the @xmath58 value of 5.407 mev , the experimental half life in ( [ gurwidth ] )",
    "can be reproduced only after the inclusion of @xmath52 = 0.03 .",
    "one can also rewrite the rectangular potential as , @xmath87 \\theta(r - r_0 ) \\",
    ", -\\,\\lambda\\ ,   \\tilde{v}_0 \\theta(r_0 - r)$ ] and adjust @xmath92 in order to satisfy the bohr - sommerfeld condition .",
    "this leads to @xmath93 = 75 mev .",
    "it is interesting to see that such a rectangular well brings the results closer to those with the realistic potentials .",
    "the preformation factor however changes to @xmath52 = 0.016 .",
    "sensitivity of the photon emission probability to the nuclear potential.,width=453,height=340 ]    the semi - classical tunneling time model could in principle be applied to other existing data on the decay of @xmath2po , @xmath3ra and @xmath4cu .",
    "these results are not presented here since the qualitative behaviour of the emission probabilities remains the same .",
    "the magnitude of the results is sensitive to the input of the preformation factor which in turn gets decided by the strength of the nuclear potential ( which is decided by the global quantum number input ) . for an input @xmath94 for example , the probabilities for @xmath3ra and @xmath2po are slightly overestimated as compared to data in the present approach .",
    "apart from the fact that the data on bremsstrahlung emission in alpha decay are sparse , there exist contradictory conclusions from theoretical approaches in literature . in the present section",
    "we try to give an overview of the results from different approaches and a comparison of their conclusions .",
    "one of the first papers which appeared on this topic was that by dyakonov and gornyi @xcite where the authors considered the tunneling motion of a charged particle using the semi - classical wkb wave functions .",
    "they derived a classical formula for the radiation spectral density in terms of the quantum mechanical traversal time delay @xmath95 which was given by , @xmath96 where the traversal time delay @xmath97 was defined as the difference of the traversal time under the barrier and the free traversal time in the same region .",
    "the above spectral density is related to the experimentally measured emission probability by a factor proportional to @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "the acceleration obtained in @xcite , @xmath99 can be rewritten in terms of the average velocities appearing in the present work .",
    "considering the fact that the authors in @xcite consider a free @xmath1 particle tunneling the barrier , the only contribution to the  delay \" is finite for the region within the barrier and elsewhere @xmath95 = 0 .",
    "thus , @xmath95 of eq.(10 ) in @xcite can be rewritten as , @xmath100 leading to @xmath101 .",
    "this appears somewhat similar to our expression where if we retain the contribution only from the acceleration at the end of the barrier , we would obtain @xmath102 .",
    "one would however expect @xmath103 to grow with increasing photon energy as compared to @xmath104 of the present work .",
    "working within the approach of @xcite but with a different formalism @xcite to evaluate @xmath104 , dyakonov obtained exponentially falling emission probabilities in reasonably good agreement with the @xmath0po data .",
    "the discrepancy to be noted here is that ( i ) kasagi _ et al_. @xcite obtained an almost perfect agreement with data ( with a dip around @xmath105 = 300 mev ) , using the model proposed in @xcite , ( ii ) the arguments presented above for @xmath103 seem to suggest that it would be difficult to expect steeply falling probabilities with the expression in @xcite and ( iii ) the author of @xcite using an apparently similar formalism did obtain exponentially falling probabilities in @xcite , however , with the absence of the dip and in disagreement with the result in ( i ) @xcite .",
    "the author mentioned a possible reason for the disagreement to be the use of different cut - offs of the coulomb potential chosen in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a fully quantum mechanical description @xcite of the photon emission accompanying alpha decay followed the early experiments and the semi - classical theoretical approaches in @xcite .",
    "the authors expressed the emission probability in terms of a transition matrix involving the radial wave functions @xmath106 and @xmath107 of the initial and final @xmath1 respectively and treating the photon field in the dipole approximation .",
    "the matrix element @xmath108 was evaluated using the following potential : @xmath87 \\theta(r - r_0 ) \\ , -\\",
    ", v_0 \\theta(r_0 - r)$ ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath88 and @xmath89 were fitted to obtain a half life consistent with an expression obtained from wave function matching .",
    "the authors found that the main contribution to photon emission stems from coulomb acceleration and only a small contribution arises from the tunneling wave function under the barrier .",
    "this is in contrast to the findings of @xcite where the authors ( in a similar kind of quantum mechanical approach involving the calculation of the transition matrix elements with a rectangular nuclear potential ) found the total spectrum to be a result of the interplay between different regions .",
    "the authors in @xcite replaced the quantum mechanical coulomb wave functions by semi - classical ones and divided the integral into different regions .",
    "they defined classical turning points and thus obtained semi - classical integral expressions for the tunneling , mixed and outside regions .",
    "whereas ref .",
    "@xcite concluded that the soft - photon limit agrees with the classical results , ref .",
    "@xcite found classical theories inadequate in reproducing the subtle interference effects . in another quantum mechanical treatment @xcite of the interference of the different space regions in tunneling the results seemed to be in agreement with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "a revived interest in the topic was seen by some more recent works @xcite which studied the experimental spectra for photon emission accompanying the @xmath109po and @xmath3ra alpha decay .",
    "the authors in @xcite for example employed a multipole expansion of the vector potential of the electromagnetic field of the daughter nucleus and also took into account the dependence on the angle between the directions of the @xmath1 particle propagation and photon emission .",
    "they found the contribution of the photon emission during tunneling to be small . in their investigation of @xmath3ra",
    "they took into account the deformation of the nucleus and found the results to be different as compared to the spherically symmetric case .",
    "even if they agreed in general with @xcite that the tunneling motion contributes little , using the potential parameters of @xcite they could however not reproduce the slope of the @xmath0po spectra .      finally , before ending this section we discuss two time dependent descriptions of the bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "in contrast to the stationary descriptions of quantum tunneling described so far , the authors in @xcite resort to numerically solving the time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "the emission probability involves the radial momentum which is evaluated using the time dependent wave function .",
    "apart from finding the time dependent modification of the wave function to be important , the authors notice that the usual assumption of a preformed alpha cluster in a well leads to sharp peaks at high frequencies in the bremsstrahlung emission .",
    "these peaks are interpreted as the manifestation of the fact that the initial localized state has some overlap from neighbouring resonant states . though the importance of these peaks would reduce if the initial state is a sharp resonance ( as is the case for @xmath0po )",
    ", the authors express the need for more experimental data on bremsstrahlung radiation by a tunneling particle in order to understand better the preformation of clusters and the above phenomenon of  quantum beats \" .",
    "in @xcite the authors propose a numerical algorithm based on the crank - nicholson method to solve the time dependent schrdinger equation and thereby evaluate average position , momentum and acceleration in alpha decay .",
    "they conclude that a big effect of the tunneling motion should be expected in the region of hard photons .",
    "though the authors do not compare their results with data , they find that the contribution coming from the tunneling motion is an order of magnitude smaller than that from coulomb acceleration .",
    "to summarize the findings of the present work , we can say that : + ( i ) we have presented a new semi - classical model based on the concept of quantum tunneling times in order to evaluate the photon emission probabilities in alpha decay of nuclei .",
    "special attention was paid to the use of realistic nuclear and coulomb potentials and the results were found sensitive to the type of nuclear potential used .",
    "+ ( ii ) a review of the existing theoretical literature shows that the opinion regarding the contribution of the photon emission during tunneling is divided among some who consider this motion as well as subtle interference effects between regions to be important and others who consider the coulomb acceleration to be the dominant one .",
    "+ ( iii ) the existing data on @xmath0po are not consistent with each other and for other nuclei are few .",
    "we emphasize here the need for new reliable data in order to resolve the intriguing question which we started with : does the alpha particle emit radiation during tunneling ?      99 a. darrigo _ et al_. , phys .",

    "<S> is investigated using realistic double folded nuclear and coulomb potentials . within this model , the contribution from the radiation emitted in front of the barrier before tunneling is much larger than that while leaving the barrier . a comparison with the data on @xmath0po shows that the results are sensitive to the nuclear potential and the rectangular well used in many of the quantum mechanical approaches can even give qualitatively different results . </S>"
