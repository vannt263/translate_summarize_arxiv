    "]    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^ \" , ]     according to experiments , the sequence of events in the endocytotic machinery in yeast is as follows  @xcite .",
    "clathrin is recruited to the invagination site  @xcite , along with adaptor proteins , such as sla1 and ent1/2  @xcite .",
    "sla1 and ent1/2 proteins bind the clathrin to the membrane , while sla2 proteins bind actin filaments to the membrane  @xcite .",
    "another protein , wasp , is also recruited to the site .",
    "wasp is an activator for the branching agent arp2/3 , enabling a branched actin filament network to be generated near the invagination site  @xcite .",
    "the growth of this network drives membrane tube formation . bar proteins eventually become prominent and help facilitate pinch - off of the membrane  @xcite . fig .",
    "2 illustrates this process using what will turn out to be proposal 1 for the organization of the actin .",
    "the initial invagination due to clathrin and other adaptor proteins takes about one to two minutes .",
    "the time for the tube to form and pinch - off , in contrast , takes only about 10 - 15 seconds .",
    "the length - to - radius ratio of the tube before pinch - off is typically 7 - 10  @xcite ( fig .",
    "1 ) .",
    "the role of clathrin may be somewhat clear .",
    "the spontaneous curvature of individual clathrin molecules presumably helps initiate membrane deformation as they indirectly attach to the membrane via adaptor proteins with the initial deformation being rather small , in contrast to mammalian cells .",
    "how the actin filament network reshapes the membrane , on the other hand , is even less clear since there are currently three competing proposals put forth by the biologists as to how this is done . the first proposal ( proposal 1 )",
    "argues that the barbed / plus ends of polymerizing actin filaments are oriented towards the flat part of the membrane with the pointed / minus ends anchored just above the clathrin bowl  @xcite .",
    "a second proposal ( proposal 2 ) argues that a collar - like structure of plus end filaments anchored to the rest of the cytoskeleton and oriented towards the neck of the deformation to elongate it and drive the pinch - off  @xcite .",
    "a third proposal ( proposal 3 ) suggests that there are two regions of attachment of the actin filaments to the membrane such that two branched actin networks are generated  @xcite .",
    "the two networks repel each other as they grow because they can not interpenetrate and , therefore , drive tube formation .",
    "2b for a schematic of proposal 1 and fig . 3 for a schematic for proposals 2 and 3 .",
    "each of these three proposals for endocytosis in yeast assumes its own respective organization for the actin filament network .",
    "can any of these models be ruled out on the basis that they do not provide the forces required to deform the cell membrane that is consistent with observations ? and what about the mechanism for pinch - off ? is there any underlying instability , or is there a more engineered approach with the pinch - off occuring at some fixed distance from the top of the invagination ?",
    "we approach clathrin - initiated endoctyosis in yeast by breaking up the sequence of fluid membrane deformations into three stages : ( i ) initiation , ( ii ) elongation , and ( iii ) pinch - off . in the process",
    "we identify a possible mechanism that could assist in the pinch - off via a pearling - like instability , where surface tension competes with bending energy in cylindrical vesicles such that , for long enough cylinders , it is energetically favorable for the cylinder to break up into spheres .",
    "an instability driven mechanism is potentially powerful given the ubiquitousness of endocytosis .",
    "this proposed pearling - like instability mechanism will be contrasted with a competing pinch - off mechanism put forth in refs .",

    "the cell membrane is also modeled as a fluid membrane  a two - component fluid membrane , where one component consists of the nonscission region and the other component consisting of the scission region such .",
    "physically , the two regions correspond to hydrolyzed pip@xmath0 and non - hydrolyzed pip@xmath0 regions .",
    "the increasing interfacial line tension between the two components drives the pinch - off with the pinch - off distance always occuring at some fixed distance from the top of the invagination site by construction , if you will",
    ". we will ultimately compare and contrast our model with this earlier model and compare our model with another more recent model in which the cell membrane is modeled as an elastic membrane with a non - zero shear modulus  @xcite .    in mammalian cells ,",
    "the two key players in endocytosis are clathrin and dynamin , a motor protein that drives the pinch - off , which is very different from yeast .",
    "one difference between yeast and mammalian cells is the presence of a cell wall in yeast cells .",
    "this wall is needed to prevent lysis due to an internal turgor pressure , which can be as large @xmath1 pa .",

    "section ii introduces our cell membrane modelling approach to endocytosis , which is divided up into three stages as mentioned previously , while section iii presents the resulting cell membrane configurations for each stage .",
    "we conclude with section iv by framing our results and discussing their implications .",
    "we model the cell membrane as an ideal two - dimensional surface residing in three - dimensional euclidean space .",
    "this surface represents the neutral surface of the physical membrane and approximately corresponds to the contact between the two leaflets of the lipid bilayer  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this surface is parametrized by curvilinear coordinates @xmath2 and is described by radius vectors @xmath3 .",
    "using standard methods of differential geometry of surfaces  @xcite , we then define the mean ( @xmath4 ) and gaussian @xmath5 curvatures of the surface .",
    "the energy of a bare membrane depends on its curvature  @xcite and can be written as @xmath6 + p\\int dv,\\label{eq : helfriech}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 is a spontaneous curvature , @xmath8 is the membrane bending rigidity , @xmath9 is the saddle - splay modulus , @xmath10 represents the surface tension , and @xmath11 represents the area of an infinitesimal element of the surface .",
    "finally , @xmath12 represents the turgor pressure present in yeast cells with @xmath13 the infinitesimal volume element for any deformation from a flat surface .    beginning with the above energy functional , which models the energy of the deformations of a bare cellular membrane",
    ", we systematically incorporate new physics associated with the three stages of endocytosis by allowing the parameters to be component - dependent or by adding new terms to the energy .",
    "clathrin is one of the first proteins recruited to the endocytic site .",
    "each clathrin molecule is a nonplanar triskelion that can pucker in the center  @xcite .",
    "clathrin molecules bind together to form a basket - like structure as a result of the intrinsic curvature of the molecules .",
    "clathrin molecules , however , require adaptor proteins , such as sla1 and ent1/2 , to bind to the membrane  @xcite .",
    "the binding process induces curvature in the membrane .",
    "the membrane rigidity may also be affected by protein binding .",
    "in fact , membrane rigidities depend on several factors , such as membrane lipid and protein composition , to account for the range of values ( tens of @xmath14 ) that is reported in the literature  @xcite .",
    "we encode the effect of the clathrin binding , via sla1 and ent1/2 , to the cell membrane with effective parameters characterizing the model of the cell membrane .",
    "the clathrin indirectly binding to one side of the membrane induces spontaneous curvature in the membrane . since the clathrin indirectly binds only to part of the membrane , we study a two - component membrane , one component denoting the bare membrane and the other denoting the part of the membrane to which the clathrin is indirectly attached with non - zero spontaneous curvature .",
    "we also vary the bending rigidity of the part of the membrane to which the clathrin is indirectly attached .",
    "the energy functional of the membrane for this initiation stage is given by  @xcite e_init= _",
    "i=1,2ds_i+pdv_i where @xmath15 denotes the sla1/ent1/2-bound membrane and @xmath16 denotes the bare membrane .",
    "we now ask how the emergent actin network exerts additional deformations / forces on the membrane following the initiation of endocytosis . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , the protein sla2 is recruited to the invagination site before actin assembly .",
    "sla2 binds to the clathrin and the membrane near the clathrin , but , according to ref .",
    "@xcite , sla2 bound to the membrane near the top of the clathrin basket binds actin filaments .",
    "these sla2 binding sites provide localized binding / anchoring of the actin filaments to the cell membrane since these sla2 molecules are near the top of the clathrin basket , i.e. `` butting '' up against the elastic clathrin basket . assuming the minus end of the actin filament anchors to the cell membrane via sla2 ,",
    "the plus end then polymerizes upward and ratchets against the cell membrane .",
    "the asymmetry between anchoring at the minus end and ratcheting at the plus end provides a time - averaged force to invaginate the membrane further into the cell .",
    "actin filament nucleation via arp2/3 increases this force .",
    "we , therefore , model the actin filament network as an applied force on the membrane localized at these sla2 anchoring points . the magnitude of this force is related to the total number of actin filaments participating in the network , and",
    "this number has been computed based on a combination of experimental data and kinetic modelling  @xcite .",
    "we use the final configuration of the emergent actin network to determine the force applied to the membrane . given the observed tubular structure of the deformation , this actin force is assumed to be axisymmetric with constant components in the radial and @xmath17 ( downward ) directions , i.e. @xmath18 . the actin force is imposed by adding a linear potential of the form @xmath19 to the energy for the part of the membrane to which the force is locally applied .",

    "this models the accumulation of the yeast actin cytoskeleton just beneath the cell membrane and near the tubular invagination as it emerges  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath24 region acts as a `` reservoir '' for tube growth .",
    "we , therefore , impose an additional quadratic potential , @xmath25 for @xmath23 , where @xmath26 is chosen so that the membrane outside this region remains flat .",
    "_ pinchoff stage : _ experiments indicate that the bar proteins dominate in this last stage , _ after _ the tubular - like deformation forms  @xcite .",
    "this observation is rather perplexing since bar proteins , which themselves are curved , can , sense and generate spontaneous curvature in the cell membrane  @xcite . in other words",
    ", why does actin play the dominant role in generating the tubular - like deformation and not the bar proteins ?",
    "we suggest that once a tubular - like deformation occurs , the bar proteins surround and confine the tube - plus - actin filament network near the top of the invagination site ( see fig .",
    "2(d ) ) to stop actin polymerization .",
    "the bar proteins only sense curvature here , not generate it . since actin polymerization is driven by a ratcheting effect in a spatially fluctuating membrane , when these spatially fluctuations are supressed , actin polymerization stops .",
    "when the polymerization stops , no more membrane material can become part of the tube .",
    "in other words , the membrane tube area remains constant . with the bar proteins confining the top part of the actin filament network against the membrane to couple the network to the membrane",
    ", we introduce an additional energetic term to the system .",
    "now that the actin network has developed , we model it as an underlying elastic network of springs . because the actin network is now connected to the membrane ( as opposed to ratcheting against it in the elongation stage ) , the filament tips of the spring network depends on the configuration of the membrane . as with any elastic network coupled to a fluid membrane , the bar protein - plus - actin filament contribution to the energy of a",

    "the turgor pressure could be lowered locally by a release of osmolytes near the endocytotic site it as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite based on experiments presented in ref .  @xcite . for the above set of parameters ,",
    "using a turgor pressure @xmath90 pa , the energy contribution from the turgor term is 20 percent of the total energy in the absence of the turgor pressure so that the depth of the dimple will decrease slightly . for @xmath91 pa ,",
    "the turgor energy is only 2 percent of the total energy in the absence of the turgor pressure can be neglected , while for @xmath92 , a different parameter range would need to be explored , such as the nonzero value of the spontaneous curvature of the membrane whose effect will be described below .",
    "of course , even in the absence of turgor pressure , a depth of 7.7 nm is small such that it may be difficult to measure given an em pixel size of 2.53 nm  @xcite .",
    "the presence of @xmath93 pa turgor pressure further decreases this depth .",
    "thus , the membrane may not be perfectly flat when the actin filaments begin to polymerize as speculated in  @xcite .",
    "we also conduct numerical minimization of the intiation stage ( figs .",
    "4b and c ) . as a check on our simulations ,",
    "we compare the maximum depth of the dimple , i.e. @xmath94 , as a function of @xmath73 , for the analytical calculation with the numerical one in fig .",

    "we place a flat patch of radius @xmath95 on a hard plane parallel to the @xmath96 plane .",

    "4a , except with additional @xmath73 values .",
    "we find very good agreement between the two .",
    "note that since non - zero @xmath9 does not drive the dimple formation ( for the parameters studied ) , we do not include it here .",
    "now that the initial small deformation due to sla1/ent1/2 binding the membrane to the clathrin basket is formed , the overall radius of the tubular invagination is set .",
    "the protein sla2 next binds to and near the clathrin dimple . only those sla2 molecules bound near the top of the clathrin dimple also bind to the actin to form a ring - like structure of binding sites  @xcite .",
    "since the clathrin dimple is elastic - like , it impedes motion of the sla2 molecules near the top of the clathrin dimple such that these sla2 binding sites provide for an anchoring of the actin filaments to the membrane to which a localized force can be exerted . as the actin filaments polymerize , the interaction of the polymerizing actin filament tips with the membrane is much more dynamic than the anchoring points since actin filaments polymerize via a ratcheting effect .",
    "the membrane just provides a constraint for the growing filament tips to ratchet against along the length of the tube .",
    "this asymmetry in the force is needed for a deformation ( other than due to a random fluctuation ) to occur .",
    "so we model the effect of the anchored at one end , and polymerizing at the other , actin filaments as a localized force on the membrane via the potential @xmath98 , as indicated in eq .",
    "in addition , the steric potential @xmath99 models the accumulation of the yeast actin cytoskeleton just beneath the cell membrane and near the tubular invagination as it emerges  @xcite .    how large is this force",
    "an estimate may be obtained from quantitative confocal microscopy measurements of 16 fluorescently labelled proteins involved in endocytosis in fission yeast  @xcite .",
    "the mean peak for the number of g - actin molecules ( monomeric actin ) is approximately 7500 .",
    "assuming all of these molecules polymerize to form actin filaments of about @xmath100 in length  @xcite and each g - actin molecule is @xmath101 in length ( @xmath102 in diameter ) then each filament contains about 40 molecules .",
    "about 200 actin filaments would then be formed .",
    "each actin filament contributes approximately @xmath103 of force , since the stalling force of an individual actin filament is approximately @xmath103  @xcite .",
    "the total force is then approximately @xmath104 , which is applied to the anchoring region of the actin filaments . since we do not take into account dynamics explicitly",
    ", we will merely implement the final value of the total force rather than increasing the force as the actin network develops . in the quasistatic limit",
    "the two approaches should be equivalent .",
    "we now turn to the direction of the actin polymerization force and review the three different proposals for the actin filament orientation  @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "2 , actin filaments polymerize `` upward '' and branch via arp2/3 to drive the membrane further into the interior of the cell . in proposal 1 ,",
    "the force is predominantly downward , as opposed to radially inward , provided the initial actin filaments are aligned less than 45 degrees to the normal of the undeformed membrane . assuming the orienation of the anchored actin filaments stays relatively fixed as branched actin filaments are generated , then the magnitude of the total actin force increases , whilst remaining fixed in direction .",
    "here we assume axial symmetry so that there are only two non - zero components of the total force .    how do the competing proposals 2 and 3 compare with proposal 1 ?",
    "in proposal 2 the actin network grows inward from the outerlying cytoskeleton towards the invagination site .",

    "if we assume a purely radially inward force then the membrane will not deform into a tube with the observed length - to - radius ratio of approximately 10 .",
    "the branched structure of the actin network , however , can provide a downward component to the total force to elongate the tube ( fig .",
    "we , therefore , distinguish proposal 1 as a case where the downward component of the total polymerization force is smaller than the radially inward component , whilst in proposal 2 , it is the reverse .",
    "proposal 3 assumes that there are two anchoring zones for actin filaments  one towards the bottom of the emerging tube and another one near the top of the tube . from these two anchoring zones",
    "emerge two actin networks simultaneously growing towards each other and , thus , repelling each other since the actin filaments can not interpenetrate ( fig .",
    "3b ) . it is this repulsion that presumably elongates the tube .",
    "coexistence of a downward force component and an upward force component , however , demands that the membrane simply stretches like a rubber band with no new cell membrane material being added to the tube . because the cell membrane is bending dominated ( and not stretching dominated ) , proposal 3 would presumably lead to rupture of the tube  @xcite .",
    "it is not as likely that proposal 3 contributes to membrane tube formation and we do not study it further as an elongation mechanism .",
    "_ so we focus on proposals 1 and 2 for the elongation stage by promoting them to models 1 and 2 , respectively , and study them quantitatively .",
    "_ to gain some insight , we first review a slightly simpler model , again , first in the absence of turgor pressure . consider a bare ( one - component ) membrane with downward force @xmath105 applied just to the origin , as opposed to being applied over an extended region of the membrane  @xcite . assume the membrane has bending rigidity @xmath8 and surface tension @xmath10 .",
    "for a cylindrically shaped membrane with a length @xmath106 and radius @xmath107 , surface tension favors reducing the radius of the cylinder / tube , while bending favors a larger radius . upon minimizing the energy ,",
    "one obtains an equilibrium radius of @xmath108 and an equilibrium force of @xmath109 . for forces less than @xmath110 ,",
    "the membrane deformation is a wide - necked depression and reaches some equilibrium depth that depends on the force , while for forces greater than @xmath110 there is a first - order transition to a cylindrical shape of arbitrary length .",
    "simulations of the membrane shape equation indicate that there is a force barrier from the wide - necked depression to cylinder formation that is 13 percent larger than @xmath110  @xcite .",
    "barriers are a characteristic signature of first - order transitions .",
    "monte carlo simulations of pure downward pulling on a membrane over an extended region ( as opposed to a single point ) support this scenario with the force barrier increasing linearly with the size of the region over which the force is exerted  @xcite .    now consider models 1 and 2 with an additional radially inward force and a steric interaction between the membrane and the actin . to begin",
    ", we expect the radially inward force to increase the force barrier to arbitrarily long cylindrical formation .",
    "we also expect the steric interaction to alter the transition since @xmath111 cuts off the wide - neck depression and makes it easier to cross - over to long cylinder formation .",
    "more specifically , we expect that as @xmath111 decreases , the change from non - cylindrical to cylindrical occurs at a lower applied force .",
    "this effect has been observed in monte carlo simulations of driving fluid vesicles through a pore  @xcite .    to test these notions we study the extension - force curve of tube / cylinder formation for the various models .",
    "we do so numerically because @xmath112 ( eq . ( 3 ) ) is a potential localized to a particular region of the membrane , which would be difficult to handle analytically .",
    "we first apply a purely downward force to a ring of vertices right above the sla1/ent1/2 attached part of the membrane .",
    "we dub this model , model 0 .",
    "the magnitude of the total force is denoted by @xmath113 and is distributed uniformly among the vertices . since @xmath114 and @xmath115 , @xmath116(for the applied point force ) . to numerically determine @xmath117 , the @xmath110 equivalent for model 0 , we pull on the ring with initially @xmath118 of total force , @xmath113 , and @xmath119 .",
    "we then reinitialize @xmath113 to take on smaller values and look for the @xmath113 at the boundary between tubes becoming shorter and tubes becoming longer .",
    "we find that @xmath120 using this algorithm . to study the force barrier",
    ", we find that deformations for @xmath121 are reasonably robust to perturbations ( stepping @xmath113 up and back down again ) such that @xmath122 is a lower bound for the barrier .",
    "see fig . 5b .",
    "we now add a radially inward force component to the force applied to the ring of vertices to address models 1 and 2 .",
    "how does this radially inward modify the shape crossover due to the downward component of the force ?",
    "for a purely radially inward force applied to the ring of vertices , the membrane will pucker inward where the force is applied and no cylindrical tube will form .",
    "the additional radially inward force increases the force barrier to long tube formation . in model 1",
    "the actin filaments are anchored at the bottom of the tube so that the downward component of the force is larger than the radially inward component .",
    "we assume that @xmath123 , which would correspond to actin filaments anchoring at an angle of approximately 35 degrees with respect to the normal of the flat part of the membrane . in model 2",
    "the radially inward component of the actin polymerization force is larger than the downward component , so we choose @xmath124 .",
    "5c depicts the depth - versus - total force curve for both models as well as two membrane configurations for model 1 .",
    "the tubes are reasonably robust to perturbations for all forces studied suggesting that the cross - over to long cylinders is not made . even though the downward component of the force is increased , it is not enough to overcome the increasing force barrier introduced with the increasing radially inward force as well . for large enough radially inward forces , the tube depth begins to decrease resulting in a nonmonotonic depth - versus - total force curve . as the contribution of the radially inward force increases , it is energetically more favorable for the membrane to deform inward as opposed to elongate .",
    "5d depicts two equilibrium configurations for model 1 . for the values of @xmath111",
    "studied , @xmath125 , the tube depth increases only by several percent with increasing @xmath111 .",
    "in other words , the applied force clearly plays the dominant role .    now on to model 2 .",
    "all tubes are reasonably robust to force perturbations , just as in model 1 , and the depth - versus - total force curve is also not monotonic .",
    "the largest depth of the membrane deformation for model 2 is about @xmath126 .",
    "while there is indeed some room to play with the ratio of the magnitude of the two components , we contend that model 1 may better account for the range of observed tube depths  @xcite .",
    "hindsight tells us that model 1 would be more reasonable in obtaining longer tubes , but such depths could have been much longer than the observed ones .",
    "the nonmonotinicity suggests an optimal force of around @xmath127 , should long tubes be the optimizing principle . and",
    "while model 2 may not necessarily act as the initial driving force to elongate the tube , we address an important role for model 2 , and one aspect of proposal 3 , during the final stage of endocytosis .    to investigate the role of turgor pressure in models 1 and 2",
    ", we find that as the turgor pressure increases to @xmath88 pa , our previous results are robust .",
    "however , for turgor pressures above this value , the depths of tubes ( for a given total force ) decrases .",
    "so the presence of large turgor pressure biases model 1 even more so",
    ". however , for @xmath90 pa , since the largest depth is approximately 55 nm , to account for larger observed depths , one can invoke the presence of myosin i to allow for extra downward force to increase the depth of the tube  @xcite .",
    "myosin i bind the membrane to the actin filaments .",
    "it has been estimated that there are approximately 300 myosin i molecules at each endoyctotic site , each exerting 2 pn of force  @xcite ( assuming myosin i carry the same force generation potential as myosin ii ) to arrive at a maximal downward force of 600 pn .",
    "such an additional downward force component would allow for long tubes even in the presence of larger ( @xmath128 pa ) turgor pressures .    .",

    "actin polymerization stops since polymerization is driven by a ratcheting effect in spatially fluctuating fluid membrane ( and by the entropically elastic actin network  @xcite ) .",
    "when actin polymerization stops , no more material can become part of the tube , and the membrane tube area remains constant .    because bar proteins confine part of the actin filament network it is now restricted to lie on the membrane .",

    "could such an increase lead to destabilization of the cylindrically - shaped membrane ? as the surface tension increases , a sinusoidal perturbation may perhaps lead to the cylindrical membrane breaking up into spherical droplets as surface tension favors spheres .",

    "this inequality , however , depends on the strength of the perturbation .    to analytically investigate the pearling instability , the volume is assumed to be constant such that the turgor pressure is not important ( see appendix b ) .",
    "this constraint is imposed so that the membrane does not shrink to a point once the surface tension term dominates .",

    "once the membrane breaks up into spheres , the spheres remain connected , as observed in experiments  @xcite .",
    "this observation differs from the rayleigh - plateau instability , where the spheres do not remain connected .",
    "so how does the vesicle nearer to the interior of the cell break off from the upper part of the tubular membrane ?",
    "the most natural answer would be via actin polymerization .",
    "proposals 2 and 3 both provide mechanisms for some downward - directed actin polymerization on the vesicle to drive it further into the cell . in proposal",
    "2 actin filaments polymerizing inward from the surrounding actin cytoskeleton towards the invagination sites can facilitate break - off of the vesicle by making a comet tail behind it .",
    "such an actin comet tail has indeed been observed in experiments  @xcite . in model 3",
    "anchoring regions of actin filaments to the membrane near the top of the invagination region , while elongation is occuring , could initiate downward actin polymerization .",
    "these filaments can then also drive the break off of the vesicle nearer to the interior of the cell from the `` top '' sphere .",
    "both routes may be important for the final break - off of the vesicle .",
    "we have developed and analyzed a quantitative three - stage model for endocytosis in yeast that is consistent with the experimental data  @xcite .",
    "we first built a model for the initial small membrane deformation due to clathrin indirectly binding to the membrane via sla1/ent1/2 .",
    "we demonstrated that the sla1/ent1/2-bound domain initiates invagination of the membrane by forming a small depression , or dimple , to set the radius of the subsequent tubular invagination .",
    "this subsequent tubular invagination is driven by actin polymerization forces , which we model as an external force applied to the membrane .",
    "we found that of the three competing proposals in the literature for the orientation of the actin filaments in driving tube formation , one proposal ( proposal 1 )  @xcite is most likely to account for the observed tubular lengthscales of the cell membrane in endocytosis in yeast  @xcite . for turgor pressures smaller than @xmath146 pa ,",
    "our results predict the applied force that optimizes the length of the tube , where the largest length - to - radius ratio is approximately 10 . for turgor pressures larger than @xmath88 pa , myosin i , an actin motor that binds directly to the cell membrane so that it can enhance actin - dependent forces on the membrane , can potentially account for the large length - to - radius ratio  @xcite .",
    "the combination of this large ratio and the effective surface tension increases due to the presence of bar proteins confining the actin filament network against the tubular cell membrane ( fig .",
    "2d ) naturally motivates that the pearling instability may assist in the scission mechanism .",
    "we showed that the pearling instability may promote spherical vesicle formation by both analytical calculations and simulations given the physiological parameters involved in endocytosis in yeast .",
    "let us contrast our model with an earlier model for endocytosis in yeast  @xcite . in the latter , the coordinated effect of protein - induced lipid phase segregation along the tubule plays a key role in vesicle scission .",
    "the phase separation between hydrolyzed and non - hydrolyzed pip@xmath0 , a membrane - bound protein to which actin attaches , calls for a two - component fluid membrane and induces an interfacial line tension between the two components to drive pinch - off .",
    "the effect of actin in this model is to decrease the effective surface tension of the membrane , which makes it easier for the interfacial line tension to scission the membrane and is rather different than the effect of actin in our model .",
    "we , however , model the actin as an applied force and are able to generate tube formations as a result .",
    "the competing quantitative model is not able to generate tubes explicitly given the manner in which actin polymerization is incorporated into the model .",
    "we also demonstrate that the pearling instability could potentially facilitate pinch - off .",
    "the frequency of endocytosis in budding yeast , invaginating its total cell membrane surface in about 100 minutes  @xcite , suggests that an instability , as opposed to coordinated effort involving lipid phase separation , would be useful .",
    "the observation that scission occurs at a range of invagination depths also favors an instability as opposed to a more regulated mechanism .",
    "comparison with another recent model is rather difficult since this new model assumes that the cell membrane is an elastic membrane with a nonzero shear modulus rather than assuming the cell membrane is a fluid one  @xcite .",
    "the formation of tubes in elastic membranes is very different from the formation of tubes in fluid membranes , where there is no shear modulus .",
    "while we have presented a quantitative model for endocytosis in yeast , how much of this story applies to endocytosis in mammalian cells ?",
    "more spherical - like membrane deformations are generated in mammalian cells due to clathrin cage formation and the motor protein , dynamin , driving pinch - off ?",
    "many of the same proteins involved in yeast clathrin - mediated endocytosis ( cme ) are conserved in mammalian cme  @xcite .",
    "it could be that the presence of the turgor pressure in yeast makes clathrin cage assembly difficult , but clathrin basket assembly less difficult given the much smaller change in volume for the basket .",
    "then it is up to the actin , etc .",
    "to finish the job . as some of our results depend on the strength of the turgor pressure , it would be good to measure it directly at an endocytotic site .",
    "there is also another route to endocytosis in mammalian cells via the clic / geec pathway , which does not require clathrin or dynamin , and forms more tubular deformations as observed in yeast  @xcite .",
    "the requirement for actin in mammalian cme has been less clear .",
    "several new studies in mammalian cells provide support for an actin requirement in the invagination and late stages of cme  @xcite . on the other hand , a recent _ in vitro _",

    ", it would be interesting to revisit the modeling of endocytosis in mammalian cells  @xcite .",
