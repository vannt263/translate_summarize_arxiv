    "here we are interested in the _ focusing problem _ in which we solve equation ( [ pressure ] ) starting from an initial distribution which is positive in the _ exterior _ of a closed bounded region @xmath18 and zero inside @xmath18 ( see fig . [ sketch ] ) . at some finite time @xmath19 , called the _ focusing time _ , @xmath14 will for the first time be positive throughout the initially empty region @xmath18 .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that for each @xmath20 there is a unique similarity exponent @xmath21 and a one - parameter family of functions @xmath22 such that the functions @xmath23 with @xmath24 , are self - similar solutions to ( [ pressure ] ) .",

    "physical experiments involving convergent gravity flows ( @xmath30 ) followed by numerical experiments @xcite indicate that both large and small deviations from rotational symmetry may be amplified as the flow tries to fill the hole . a formal linear stability analysis for general @xmath2 and @xmath31 ( cf .",
    "@xcite and appendix 2 ) shows that the graveleau solutions are indeed unstable , at least when @xmath2 is close to unity , and that the number of unstable modes increases as @xmath32 .",
    "this suggests that a sequence of bifurcations occurs as @xmath2 decreases from @xmath33 to @xmath34 .",
    "the existence of these bifurcations is proved in @xcite .",
    "the bifurcating solutions are self - similar , but not axially symmetric . they are invariant with respect to the action of the group @xmath35 of @xmath36 real orthogonal matrices . in this paper",

    "the bifurcating solutions are non - radial self - similar focusing solutions possessing @xmath3-fold symmetry , i.e. , the symmetry of @xmath42 .",
    "numerical studies show that for each @xmath1 the bifurcation point @xmath43 is unique so that the graveleau solutions are linearly stable with respect to perturbations with @xmath3-fold symmetry for @xmath44 and unstable for @xmath45 . moreover , the @xmath46 are ordered @xmath47 crude estimates for the first four @xmath46 are given in table i ( see also table iv in appendix 2 ) . @xmath48",

    "this is confirmed by numerical linear stability analysis which shows that the graveleau interface is unstable with respect to perturbations with wave number 2 for all values of @xmath2 . in particular , there appear to be no bifurcating branches of self - similar focusing solution with the 2-fold symmetry .",
    "we discuss this briefly in section 5 of this paper and in more detail in reference @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we carry out detailed numerical studies of focusing solutions to equation ( [ pressure ] ) whose initial distributions have interfaces which are circles with small perturbations",
    ". mainly , we deal with initial conditions whose interfaces are of the form @xmath50 with @xmath51 , although in section 5 we will consider perturbations with mixed modes . by using a numerical renormalization technique inspired by the pioneering work of chen and goldenfeld @xcite",
    "we are able to follow the evolution of the interface to times very close to the focusing time .",
    "thus we are able to obtain very detailed information about the asymptotic form of the solution as it focuses .",
    "as we shall see below , for single mode perturbations with @xmath3-fold symmetry , the numerical results indicate that the leading term in the focusing asymptotics is a self - similar solution of the form @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a parameter , @xmath54 is the similarity exponent , and @xmath55 satisfies @xmath56 moreover , the focusing interface is asymptotically of the form @xmath57 and @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the similarity exponent for the graveleau solution and @xmath46 is the bifurcation point found in @xcite .",

    "( [ pressure ] ) .",
    "we compute the derivatives of the term @xmath68 with a second order upwind eno ( essentialy non - oscillatory ) scheme @xcite ( see appendix 1 ) .",
    "this method guarantees that the numerical scheme will be able to describe accurately the discontinuities on the first derivative that spontaneously appear in the case @xmath9 ( hamilton - jacobi limit ) and at the interface .",
    "due to the diffusive nature of the laplacian term in eq .",
    "( [ pressure ] ) , the corresponding derivatives are computed with standard centered second order approximations , @xmath69 @xmath70    near the interface there is a discontinuity in the first derivative that may generate numerical errors when we compute the laplacian with eq .",

    "therefore , for the grid points @xmath71 situated at a distance smaller than @xmath72 from the interface , the laplacian is computed by linearly extrapolating in the variable @xmath73 the values of the laplacian from the nodes of behind , which were previously computed with eq .",
