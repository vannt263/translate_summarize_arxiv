    "theoretical studies predict that the final stage of terrestrial planet formation involves a series of giant impacts between protoplanets .",
    "this stage is triggered by the dispersal of nebula gas , and probably lasts approximately 10 to 100 myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the aftermath of the last impact , the planets probably begin in a molten state ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . detecting molten terrestrial planets in extrasolar systems is of great significance in testing the widely accepted view of their hot origins .",
    "the rocky planets can acquire water throughout formation by various processes , such as the local accretion of hydrated and icy planetesimals @xcite , chemical reactions between nebula gas and silicate melts @xcite , and delivery via ice - bearing bodies from the outer orbital region @xcite .",
    "a substantial amount of water would be delivered during planetary formation .",
    "water acquired through the lattermost process alone would exceed the current earth s ocean mass by more than tens times .",
    "since giant impacts do not blow off the entire water inventory @xcite , early molten planets are likely to be covered by a steam - rich atmosphere .",
    "emergent spectra of hot molten planets have been investigated for several atmospheric compositions , including water - rich atmospheres .",
    "@xcite first presented thermal emission spectra for the hot surface conditions , considering various possible atmospheric compositions ; solar and enhanced metallicity atmospheres , @xmath5-@xmath6 atmospheres , and venus composition atmospheres . since the solidus temperature of peridotite rocks is approximately 1,400 k at the planetary surface ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the molten surface emits strong radiation not only in the infrared ( ir ) , but also in the visible and near - ir .",
    "they showed that , although the steam - rich atmosphere obscures the hot surface , intense thermal emission from the surface would leak through near - ir atmospheric windows , which are relatively transparent . @xcite further explored emergent high - resolution spectra for atmospheric compositions in equilibrium with magmas with compositions of earth s continental crust and the bulk silicate earth , taking into account atmospheric chemistry and structure self - consistently .",
    "they found out that the atmospheres are dominated by @xmath5 and @xmath6 , considering quenching effects .",
    "additional opacity sources , such as @xmath7 and @xmath8 , could reduce the brightness temperature by a factor of two to three , but the emergent spectra still reveal the features similar to those without these additional opacity sources .",
    "@xcite concluded that the most favorable wavelength range for direct imaging with future telescopes will be 1 to 4 @xmath9 .",
    "these previous studies revealed that the mass of the steam atmosphere is a determining factor for spectral detectability of hot molten planets .",
    "however , the mass of the steam atmosphere does not remain constant during the solidification process .",
    "the atmosphere would grow by degassing from the planetary interior or would escape into space @xcite .",
    "atmospheric evolution would significantly affect the emergent spectra during solidification of the magma ocean .",
    "in addition , atmospheric evolution is also crucial to the thermal evolution of magma oceans @xcite .",
    "since the strong greenhouse effect of water vapor prevents heat from escaping , a magma ocean is sustained longer under a more massive atmosphere .",
    "although a growing atmosphere keeps the planet in a molten state for a longer period of time , its spectral signatures become fainter as a result of increasing surface obscuration .",
    "conversely , if the atmosphere escapes with time , the planet becomes brighter , but the magma ocean quickly solidifies over a shorter timescale .",
    "thus , a trade - off relationship is expected between the spectral intensity and occurrence rate of the magma - covered planets , as suggested by @xcite .",
    "variations in water inventory would also affect the planetary spectra and their time evolution .",
    "the water in the current earth s ocean amounts to approximately 0.023 wt % in bulk content , and its total , including the water stored in the crust and mantle , is probably at most 0.23 wt % ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "extrasolar terrestrial planets could exhibit large variations in water amount just after formation as a result of a combination of water supply and loss processes .",
    "recent calculations have indicated that the lifetime of magma oceans depends on the initial water inventory and the orbital distance from the host star @xcite .",
    "therefore , the occurrence rate of hot molten planets as a function of orbital distance would be related to the expected variety in initial water endowment on terrestrial planets .",
    "as described above , spectral calculations of hot molten planets have been presented for various atmospheric compositions by several authors @xcite .",
    "they have concluded that the detectability in terms of spectral intensities depends primarily on the mass of the atmosphere . on the other hand ,",
    "recent evolutionary calculations have shown that the mass of the steam atmosphere overlying a magma ocean greatly varies with time by degassing and escape processes @xcite .",
    "they also indicated that the evolutionary history of the steam atmosphere and its cooling time strongly depends on the orbital distance from the star .",
    "although they suggested that the occurrence rate of molten planets depends on the planetary orbit as well , their evolutionary model is not able to predict the variations of thermal emission spectra along with the evolution of the steam atmosphere because of the assumption of a gray gas in their radiative transfer model .    in the present paper ,",
    "we incorporate a newly developed non - gray radiative transfer model into the evolutionary model by @xcite to describe the spectral evolution of hot molten planets along with the evolution of steam atmospheres during the solidification of a magma ocean .",
    "this enables us to self - consistently examine the brightness variations of solidifying planets and the duration of the molten state .",
    "we also investigate the dependence of the brightness of solidifying planets on orbital distance and obtain a consistent relationship between planet - to - star contrast and orbital separation .",

    "for the other layers , the lapse rate is given by a pseudo - moist adiabat under the assumption that condensates are removed immediately as they form .",
    "for simplicity , the effects of clouds are ignored in the present study . since we consider a pure steam atmosphere , the pseudo - moist adiabat overlaps the saturation curve of water in the present study .",
    "we apply a liquid - vapor saturation curve at temperatures above 273 k and an ice - vapor curve at temperatures below 273 k. the dry adiabat is calculated using the peng - robinson equation of state in a manner similar to @xcite , but the heat capacity of water vapor in the ideal gas state is taken from @xcite as a function of temperature in order to make the heat capacity applicable to higher - temperature conditions .",

    "the planetary surface emits strong radiation in the visible and near - ir .",
    "although the hot planetary surface emits significant radiation , the outgoing thermal emission from the top of the atmosphere is greatly attenuated by absorption and scattering by the steam atmosphere .",

    "the pressure level at which the optical depth of absorption is unity is much lower than that of scattering . in the near - ir wavelength region",
    ", therefore , the brightness temperature provides a good estimate of the atmospheric temperature at an optical depth of unity .    at the visible wavelength",

    ", the thermal radiation from each band is also tabulated after averaging the high - resolution spectra with a resolving power of 100 , which is a typical value for future direct imaging .",
    "we consider a sun - like host star , the bolometric luminosity and xuv radiation of which evolve in a manner similar to solar analogs .",
    "we adopt a solar standard model by @xcite for luminosity enhancement with stellar age and linearly extrapolate it after a stellar age of 4.567 gyr .",
    "the stellar spectrum is assumed to be a blackbody spectrum with an effective stellar temperature of 5,800 k.    water is assumed to be partitioned between the atmosphere and the magma ocean according to its solubility into basaltic melts .",

    "we start the evolution calculations from a very hot state with a surface temperature of 3,000 k and stop the calculations when the surface temperature reaches the solidus temperature at the surface ( approximately 1,370 k ) or the stellar age reaches 10 gyr , which is comparable to the main sequence lifetime of the host star .",
    "the solidification is assumed to start at a stellar age of 0.05 gyr ( @xmath44 ) .",

    "this corresponds to a range in bulk water content of from @xmath47 to 1.2 wt % .",
    "furthermore , we consider the orbital distance from the star of between 0.4 and 1.5 au .",
    "a hot planet cools and solidifies as it emits large outgoing radiation .",
    "spectral variations during planetary solidification reflect the evolution of surface temperature and atmospheric pressure . at early stages of evolution",
    ", the highest fraction of water is expected to dissolve in a deep magma ocean because of the high solubility of water into silicate melts @xcite .",
    "the steam atmosphere therefore accounts for a modest fraction of its total inventory .",
    "as the solidification proceeds , the silicate magma becomes enriched in water and degases at a rate that depends on the solidification rate of the magma ocean ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . whether the steam atmosphere grows with time depends on the net balance of the degassing rate of water from the interior and its loss rate by hydrodynamic escape @xcite .",
    "considering a magma ocean covered with a steam atmosphere , @xcite proposed that terrestrial planets have a distinct early evolution that depends on whether the orbital distance from the host star exceeds a critical distance .",

    "when the troposphere is saturated by water vapor to a sufficiently deep level , the outgoing planetary flux becomes constant .",
    "this constant value is referred to as the radiation limit and corresponds to the lower limit of the planetary radiation for the hot surface conditions considered in the present study .",
    "the radiation limit of the steam atmospheres has been extensively investigated , and its value is approximately 280 to 310 @xmath54 @xcite .",
    "our model yields a radiation limit of 280 @xmath54 .",
    "@xcite also classified terrestrial planets into two types according to their orbital distance : type i for planets beyond @xmath48 and type ii for planets inside @xmath48 .",
    "these two types of planets will solidify over vastly different timescales , and their atmospheres also evolve differently , due to different cooling mechanisms . in the following subsections , we describe the spectral changes over the solidification of type - i and type - ii planets with an initial water inventory of 5 @xmath45 as a nominal case .",
    "the type - i planet is characterized by a sufficiently far distance from the host star , where the net incident stellar radiation is smaller than the radiation limit .",
    "since the outgoing planetary radiation never falls below the radiation limit , the type - i planet is self - luminous over its solidification period .",

    "[ typei&ii_evol](a ) ) .",
    "the rapid solidification results in the monotonic growth of the steam atmosphere towards the end of the magma ocean period by keeping the degassing rate of water higher than its loss rate .",
    "although the surface temperature during the magma ocean period is extremely high , the bolometric luminosity is not so large compared to that from the hot surface .",

    "the most recognizable diagnostic sign of a hot surface is emission at the visible and near - ir wavelengths .",

    "the thermal fluxes rapidly decrease with time and fall below @xmath60 due to the decrease in the surface temperature and the growth of the steam atmosphere .",
    "the thermal radiation of the m , l , and ks bands initially decreases with time as well , but eventually levels off .",
    "figure [ typei&ii_spec](a ) shows the spectral evolution in the visible and near - ir .",
    "the planetary thermal radiation declines with time , and then , at wavelengths longer than approximately 2 @xmath9 , the thermal radiation becomes constant .",
    "this is a result of the same mechanism as the occurrence of the radiation limit of the steam atmospheres and indicates that , for the wavelengths at which water vapor has strong absorption , the emission level becomes as high as that at which the thermal structure is uniquely determined by the saturation curve of water . since the thermal structure around the emission level remains the same , the thermal radiation from the m , l , and ks bands becomes constant , as shown in fig .",
    "[ typei&ii_evol](a ) .",
    "in contrast to the type - i planet , the type - ii planet receives a net stellar radiation that is larger than the radiation limit because of its proximity to the host star .",
    "the planet therefore would reach a radiative energy balance during the course of solidification .",
    "early in its solidification , the outgoing planetary flux far exceeds the net stellar flux , and the planet is highly self - luminous , as in the case of the type - i planet ( fig .",
    "[ typei&ii_evol](b ) ) . in the case of the type - ii planet , however , the planetary flux decreases with time and eventually balances the net stellar flux at approximately 0.6 myr .",
    "if no water loss occurs , the radiative balance is perfectly achieved , and the magma ocean does not solidify .",
    "actually , as the steam atmosphere becomes thinner with time due to the hydrodynamic escape , the planet emits slightly larger radiation than the net stellar radiation .",
    "the type - ii planet thus slowly cools and solidifies , losing its atmosphere .",
    "the solidification rate of the magma ocean is regulated by the loss rate of water such that a sufficient net loss of the steam atmosphere occurs so that the net outgoing flux becomes positive .",
    "the resulting solidification time is approximately 100 myr in this nominal case , which is much longer than that of the type - i planet .",
    "the most striking feature is that the higher band fluxes continue over this long solidification period ( third panel in fig .",

    "the long - lived and constant thermal emission in the window regions occurs by attaining quasi - energy balance on the type - ii planet . in the quasi - energy balance state ,",
    "the outgoing planetary radiation roughly balances the incoming net stellar radiation . in order to satisfy this requirement ,",
    "the amount of the atmosphere must be regulated during the course of solidification . as the surface temperature decreases with time",
    ", the amount of the atmosphere must decrease such that the planet maintains a planetary radiation that is nearly equal to , or , strictly speaking , slightly larger than , the net stellar flux ( fig .",
    "[ typei&ii_evol](b ) ) .",
    "consequently , the resulting spectra do not change during a quasi - energy balance state , except at the shorter wavelengths , at which the opacity of the atmosphere is thin enough for the outgoing thermal emission to be sensitive to surface temperature ( fig .",
    "[ typei&ii_spec](b ) ) .",
    "the above requirement for planetary radiation generally applies to planets in ( quasi-)energy balance , irrespective of the atmospheric amounts and composition .",
    "although additional opacity sources would increase the opacities at some wavelengths and would change the overall spectra , the planet in quasi - energy balance is still expected to emit high thermal radiation from the relatively transparent wavelengths .",
    "figure [ typeii_ptpath](a ) shows the evolutionary paths of surface temperature and pressure ( the @xmath62 path ) during solidification for various initial inventories of water .",

    "in particular , for the case in which the quasi - energy balance has been achieved during the course of solidification , the lifetime of the magma ocean is well approximated by the time required for total loss of the initial water inventory ( fig .",

    "we consider two important quantities that characterize the ease of detection of a planet against stellar speckles .",
    "one is planet - to - star contrast , which is defined by the ratio of the planet flux to the stellar flux , and the other is the planet - star angular separation on the celestial sphere .",

    "as long as the planet solidifies on a shorter timescale than the main sequence lifetime of the host star , the minimum contrast level has the highest likelihood of detection . for the case in which the magma ocean is sustained for as long as the main sequence of the star , the planet - to - star contrast gradually increases with time from the minimum contrast level , because the planet must emit a larger planetary radiation from the near - ir band in order to maintain quasi - energy balance in accordance with the luminosity enhancement .    the minimum contrast increases for the planet closest to the star , because this planet receives a larger net stellar flux and",

    "we adopt @xmath80 of 10 . using a typical duration of a magma ocean of @xmath82 years ,",
    "we obtain @xmath61 0.01 for @xmath83 in the type - i orbital region .",
    "this value is common for type - i planets which formed with initial water inventory comparable to or exceeding the total amount of water of the modern earth .",
    "the potentially favorable target for molten type - i planets would be young and other spectral type stars such as fomalhaut .",
    "on the other hand , type ii planets have a wide range of solidification time after single impact , which strongly depends on the initial amount of water . in the extreme case that the solidification time exceeds the period of giant impact phase , which probably lasts until the stellar age of 0.1 gyr , the total duration of a molten state is given by the duration of a molten state after single collision . in the type - ii orbital region , the initial amount of water thus greatly affects the probability of detecting molten planets .",
    "given that @xmath79 does not exceed 10 gyr , @xmath83 ranges from @xmath61 0.01 to 6 in the case of type - ii planets , considering the initial inventory of water of from one - tenth to several tens times the earth s ocean mass .    here",

    "although the xuv flux could exhibit greater fluctuation for pre - main sequence stars , its effects might not be so significant because of its short duration relative to the subsequent evolution .",
    "although no observational data are available at wavelengths between 360 and 921 @xmath85 due to strong absorption by the interstellar medium , the total xuv flux would not have profound uncertainty compared with that of the other parameters , because the estimated energy flux in this wavelength range is at most 10 to 20% @xcite .",
    "although our model can not predict the exact inventory of primordial water due to the numerous uncertainties described above , estimating the order of magnitude of the exact inventory of primordial water would be still useful .",
    "our model suggests that , if the initial bulk content of water exceeds approximately 1 wt% , molten planets would be present over the main sequence of the host g - type star ( fig . [ mozone ] ) . since the critical distance , which separates the type - i and type - ii planets , originates from the presence of the radiation limit of steam atmospheres , detection of a critical distance would offer a diagnostic test to determine whether water is generally one of the major volatile species of extrasolar terrestrial planets . in the orbital region of type - ii planets ,",
    "the detection of hot signatures in the planetary spectrum will provide a lower limit for initial water inventory , which is sufficient to sustain the molten state for a given stellar age , whereas no detection will constrain its upper limit , so that the planet will lose most of its water and become solidified .      the actual spectrum from the planet",

    "this originates from the difference in the peak wavelength of the planck function between the surface temperature and the stellar effective temperature .",
    "the peak wavelengths are approximately 1.4 @xmath9 for 2,000 k and 500 nm for 5,800 k.    for @xmath91 , the contrast of the reflection can be estimated as follows : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the earth radius . because the albedo in the u - b band is @xmath94 , as shown in figure [ fig : lblspec](b ) and the reflection dominates in this band",

    "the middle panel in fig .",
    "[ phase ] shows the color index of each band to the v band relative to the host star as a function of phase angle . as the phase angle increases , the color becomes redder for all bands because the contribution of the thermal emission increases .",
    "the color indexes of the i and r bands remain bluer than that of the host star , whereas the color indexes of the other spectral bands becomes redder than that of the host star",
    ". the color indexes could vary by approximately 6 for the j , h , ks , and l bands during a complete cycle of orbital motion .",
    "these color changes are comparable to the color differences between rocky planets , such as earth and mars , and gaseous planets such as uranus and neptune .",
    "following @xcite , we consider the color - magnitude diagram of the molten planets .",
    "figure [ color - mag ] shows the evolutionary paths of the thermal emission in the h - k color and absolute h magnitude diagram .",
    "the molten planets are as faint as the planets in the solar system , but are distinctly redder in color .",
    "this is because the thermal emission , which is much redder than the stellar light , dominates the planetary spectrum for molten planets , whereas the color of the planets in the solar system mostly reflects the reflected light .",
    "we also estimate the effects of stellar light reflected by clouds on the h - k color by assuming that the cloud coverage is 0.5 . in this case , as the thermal emission becomes fainter , the reflected light becomes more dominant in the near - ir spectrum .",
    "the reflected light could determine the color at the later stage for the planet at 1 au , whereas the color is still much redder than that of the star during solidification of the planet at 0.7 au , including the quasi - energy balance state . a self - consistent evolutionary calculation , including cloud formation",
    ", will be the subject of future research to examine actual color variations that occur during the course of solidification .",
    "we compare the brightness temperatures of our model with those reported by @xcite and @xcite for wavelengths ranging from 1 to 5 @xmath9 ( fig .",
    "[ teff_comp ] ) .",
    "although the atmospheric compositions differ among these models , our model spectrum is more similar to that in @xcite , especially for the atmospheric composition in a chemical equilibrium with silicate melts having the composition of the earth s continental crust .",
    "the brightness temperature , i.e. , the thermal radiation , of the our model tends to be lower than that of @xcite for continental - crust - composition magmas , probably because of the @xmath5-rich composition and the lower temperature in the upper atmosphere of our model .",
    "although we have thus far discussed only pure steam atmospheres , the inclusion of other gaseous species would not substantially alter our conclusions .",
    "adding other opacity sources would reduce the planet - to - star contrasts in atmospheric windows for type - i and -ii planets in a self - luminous state , whereas doing so would only affect the relative contrast of atmospheric windows for the type - ii planets in quasi - energy balance .",
    "if the thermal radiation decreases at certain wavelengths during the quasi - energy balance state , the planet must emit larger thermal radiation at other wavelengths in order to maintain the energy balance while reducing the amount of the steam atmosphere .",
    "the same would be said of the effects of clouds . at very early stage ,",
    "a molten planet would have no cloud cover because of the hot temperature .",
    "as the temperature drops and the atmosphere grows , however , clouds would start to form by condensation of water vapor in the atmosphere .",
    "clouds would increase the planetary albedo , which makes the critical distance smaller by reducing the net incident stellar radiation .",
    "clouds also would enhance a greenhouse effect , which makes the critical distance larger .",
    "the presence of clouds therefore would affect the actual position of the critical distance through a balance of the opposing effects of cloud albedo and a greenhouse effect .",
    "however , as long as a planet is type ii , it would emit strong thermal radiation through the atmospheric windows even with some cloud cover , to maintain energy balance for the same reason as the case with additional gaseous opacity described above .",
    "to a first order approximation , we have assumed that the planetary interior has an adiabatic temperature profile in our evolutionary model .",
    "although horizontal inhomogeneity would exist in the convective magma ocean , especially around boundary layers , the planet would have a nearly uniform surface temperature under a thick and massive steam atmosphere considered in the present study , because the timescale of heat transfer by atmospheric circulation is generally much shorter than the timescale of radiative cooling and of heat transfer by convection of the magma ocean .    in the evolutionary model",
    ", we have also assumed that the magma ocean effectively transports internal heat to the surface and that the atmosphere is in solution equilibrium with the magma ocean for calculations of a degassing rate .",
    "since the assumption of the solution equilibrium leads to a maximum estimate of the atmospheric growth rate , the thermal radiation predicted in the present study would be a minimum estimate , whereas the decline timescale of the emergent spectra would be overestimated .",
    "heat flux and a degassing rate from a magma ocean strongly depends on the magma viscosity .",
    "thermal structure and heat transfer of a magma ocean has been extensively reviewed by @xcite .",
    "viscosity of ultramafic silicate melt near liquidus is as low as 0.1 pa s at low pressures ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the similar value can be assumed for the magma viscosity under the mantle conditions because of small temperature and pressure effects for a low - viscosity and completely depolymerized melt ( see discussions by @xcite ) .",
    "as the rayleigh numbers are typically in the range of @xmath97-@xmath98 with the low viscosity @xcite , the magma ocean at early stage is expected to be highly turbulent and in a state of vigorous convection .",
    "the highly turbulent magma ocean is considered to be homogeneous and its thermal structure is to be nearly adiabatic .    along with cooling ,",
    "the magma ocean starts to solidify at great depth , because the slopes of liquidus and solidus of earth s mantle are steeper than those of adiabats in the magma ocean @xcite . on the other hand , when a solid crust starts to form depends on the energy balance at the surface .",
    "the energy balance between heat flux from the magma ocean and radiative heat flux from the surface determines the surface temperature .",
    "a steam atmosphere has a strong blanketing and greenhouse effect .",
    "even with a surface atmospheric pressure of 10 bar , its total opacity exceeds @xmath99 in the 10-@xmath9 atmospheric window .",
    "therefore , the insulating atmosphere maintains the surface in a molten state if the heat flux from the magma ocean is sufficiently high .",
    "the most important parameter for heat transport of the magma ocean is the magma viscosity , which varies dramatically depending on the melt fraction in the magma .",
    "experimental studies have shown that viscosity of partial melts abruptly increases from a liquid - like low value to a solid - like high value ( rheological transition ) , when its melt fraction falls below a critical value , approximately 40 % ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "as long as the surface temperature is high enough to keep the melt fraction larger than the critical value , the magma ocean can transport the internal heat to the surface efficiently by vigorous convection , and also keep a high renewal rate of the surface .",
    "as the surface temperature decreases , the melt fraction decreases and reaches the critical value , and then solid - state convection takes over .",
    "the heat flux from the magma ocean is no longer high enough to keep the surface molten .",
    "the surface temperature rapidly drops and a conductive lid crust starts to develop at the surface @xcite .",
    "as the solidification proceeds , the depth of the magma ocean becomes shallow and the total mass of the magma decreases .",
    "the magma ocean becomes enriched in water , which is incompatible to silicate cumulates .",
    "the solution equilibrium of water between the atmosphere and the magma ocean is assumed in our model , whereas actually a certain degree of supersaturation of water might be required for degassing by bubbling and @xmath5 diffusion processes .",
    "@xcite discussed the effects by the simple treatment for the degassing processes on the overall solidification time of the magma ocean . for degassing involving the bubble formation",
    ", bubbles are required to grow fast and detach from the magma flows .",
    "although the supersaturation required for the efficient bubble detachment remains uncertain , even using 50-fold water solubility shortens the solidification time by a factor of at most 4 , based on the results by @xcite .",
    "they also estimated the supersaturation required for the replenishment of the atmosphere against its loss by the molecular diffusion process only , using a molecular diffusion coefficient in basaltic melt by @xcite .",
    "they showed that a modest degree of supersaturation is enough for the replenishment , as long as the magma viscosity is a liquid - like low value .",
    "eddy diffusion process would significantly lower the required supersaturation .",
    "however , at a very late stage after the melt fraction reaches the critical value , both the resurfacing rate and the efficiency of bubble detachment from the magma flows would be greatly reduced due to the solid - like high viscosity . redefining the solidification time as the time required for the surface temperature to drop to 1,700 k , around which the melt fraction is estimated to reach the critical fraction for the rheological transition ,",
    "shortens the lifetime of the magma ocean on type - i planets by a factor of less than 5 in the parameter range considered herein .",
    "this estimate is consistent with the typical duration of the magma ocean phase of 1 myr reported by @xcite . for type - ii planets",
    ", the redefinition of the solidification time has less effect on the lifetime of the magma ocean , as long as the water endowment is sufficiently large so that the quasi - energy balance is attained at a surface temperature above 1,700 k. these uncertainties would be smaller compared to the parameter uncertainties associated with the energy - limited escape rate , as discussed above .",
    "although we have examined only earth - sized planets in the present study , the orbital - dependent dichotomy in lifetime and spectral evolution would exist for different planetary masses as well .",
    "@xcite reported that the radiation limit increases by approximately 20 % for a rocky planet with 5 times the earth s mass .",
    "the critical distance therefore would become closer to the host star for larger planetary masses , compared to that for earth - sized planets . although the larger radiation limit also would have a role to make the cooling of a type - i planet faster ,",
    "the overall duration of a molten state may be roughly proportional to the planetary mass because of the larger heat capacity of the planet @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , for a massive type ii planet , the lifetime of a magma ocean would become extremely longer , with the assumption that the bulk content of water is the same .",
    "this is because the total amount of water is proportional to the planetary mass , whereas the total escape rate of hydrogen is independent on the planetary mass itself , as long as the energy - limited escape rate is considered . in terms of spectral detectability",
    ", more massive planets are expected to be brighter and therefore easier to detect because of their larger surface area @xcite .",
    "future studies will expand this line of research by taking into account planetary mass , different types of stars and an expected variety of atmospheric compositions .",
    "we have examined the lifetime of the magma ocean and its spectral evolution for earth - sized terrestrial planets along with the evolution of the steam atmosphere . due to the presence of the radiation limit of steam atmospheres , the thermal and spectral evolution of the magma ocean strongly depends on the planetary orbital distance from the host star .",
    "planets beyond the critical distance @xmath48 ( type i ) are self - luminous throughout solidification .",
    "the thermal radiation from atmospheric windows decreases on a timescale shorter than @xmath100 years .",
    "the lifetime of the magma ocean is less sensitive to the semi - major axis in the type - i orbital region .",
    "consequently , young stars should be targets in searching for molten planets in this orbital region .",
    "in the case of a planet formed inside @xmath48 ( type ii ) , the outgoing planetary radiation can balance the net incoming stellar radiation after a short self - luminous phase .",
    "the emergent spectra during the quasi - energy balance state are approximately independent of the surface temperature and pressure .",
    "the type - ii planet maintains high thermal radiation from near - ir atmospheric windows throughout the lifetime of the magma ocean .",
    "the lifetime of the magma ocean increases for a larger initial inventory of water .",
    "type - ii planets are brighter at smaller orbital distance so as to balance the larger stellar radiation , whereas these planets solidify on a shorter timescale because of the higher loss rate of water they experience .",
    "the sensitivity of the magma - ocean lifetime to the water amount and the orbital distance increases the possibility of placing constraints on the water endowment of terrestrial planets based on the occurrence rate of molten planets for a given stellar age .",
    "our model predicts that terrestrial planets remain molten over the main sequence of the host star in the type - ii orbital region if the initial bulk content of water exceeds approximately 1 wt% .",
    "the composite spectrum is dominated by reflected light at the visible wavelengths and by thermal emission at the near - ir wavelengths for type - ii planets in the quasi - energy balance state .",
    "the atmospheric windows in the near - ir are favorable for detecting thermal emission , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "the h - k color of the thermal emission is strikingly redder than that of the host star and the reflected light , whereas the solidifying type - i and type - ii planets are typically as faint as planets having moderate surface temperature .",
    "therefore , type - i and type - ii planets could form a group distinct from the observed brown dwarfs and the planets in the solar system in the color - magnitude diagram .",
    "evolution calculations including cloud formation will be required in order to make more detailed predictions regarding color and appearance .",
    "the k and l bands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet - to - star contrast of the type - ii planets is approximately @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , the search around @xmath48 , which is close to the inner edge of the habitable zone , will have a higher detection probability in terms of the duration of the molten state .",
    "for both the type - i and type - ii planets , in visible atmospheric windows , the contrast of the thermal emission drops below @xmath3 in less than @xmath4 years , whereas that of the reflected stellar light remains @xmath3 .",

    "our results agree well with those by @xcite , rather than by @xcite , probably because of the differences in the treatment of the continuum absorption of water vapor .",
    "@xcite indicated that the self continuum absorption of water vapor is underestimated in a mt_ckd 2.4 model , which was used by @xcite , especially in a wavenumber range from 2000 to 3000 @xmath129 , compared with the mt_ckd 2.5 model used in our model and a bps formalism used by @xcite .",
    "this likely explains why the planetary radiation starts to increase at the lower surface temperature in @xcite .",
    "the bond albedos with our model are larger than those with the previous studies by about 0.05 .",
    "this is probably because we underestimate the absorption and scattering processes at the wavenumbers larger than 30,000 @xmath129 .",

    "<S> we present the thermal evolution and emergent spectra of solidifying terrestrial planets along with the formation of steam atmospheres . </S>",
    "<S> the lifetime of a magma ocean and its spectra through a steam atmosphere depends on the orbital distance of the planet from the host star . for a type - i planet , which is formed beyond a certain critical distance from the host star , the thermal emission declines on a timescale shorter than approximately @xmath0 years . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , young stars should be targets when searching for molten planets in this orbital region . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , a type - ii planet , which is formed inside the critical distance , will emit significant thermal radiation from near - infrared atmospheric windows during the entire lifetime of the magma ocean . </S>",
    "<S> the ks and l bands will be favorable for future direct imaging because the planet - to - star contrasts of these bands are higher than approximately @xmath1-@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> our model predicts that , in the type - ii orbital region , molten planets would be present over the main sequence of the g - type host star if the initial bulk content of water exceeds approximately 1 wt% . in visible atmospheric windows , the contrasts of the thermal emission drop below @xmath3 in less than @xmath4 years , whereas those of the reflected light remain @xmath3 for both types of planets . </S>",
    "<S> since the contrast level is comparable to those of reflected light from earth - sized planets in the habitable zone , the visible reflected light from molten planets also provides a promising target for direct imaging with future ground- and space - based telescopes . </S>"
