    "the gis spectra are qualitatively similar , but detailed spectral analysis of these data is more difficult because , at the time of this work , significant uncertainties exist in the gis gain ( as much as 45  ev shifts near the si k@xmath1 line complex ; ken ebisawa , personal communication ) . for an emission - line dominated spectrum , such as the ones here",

    "asca_. there is no significant change in the size of the remnant with energy , especially at high energies , hence there is no evidence for the presence of a hard , pulsar - powered , synchrotron nebula within the remnant .",

    "this absorbed powerlaw model for our control region was then included as an additional component in the spectral fits for the snr , in order to account for the galactic ridge emission contained in the snr spectrum .",

    ", we show the _ rosat _ pspc x - ray contours overlayed on the dss greyscale image of this region . for all instruments",
    "the position of the unresolved source is consistent with the optical cluster ngc  5281 as shown in figure  2b and previously noted for the _ rosat _ data by ggm .",
    "modeling the spectrum of the point source with an absorbed powerlaw , column density @xmath31  atoms  cm@xmath6 , and spectral index @xmath32 , we find that the flux from this source in the 0.3@xmath03.5  kev band is @xmath33  ergs  cm@xmath6  s@xmath7 .",
    "this flux is consistent with that expected from hd  119682 , the third brightest star in ngc  5281 , an o9 , @xmath34 star , using the relation of maccacaro et  al .",
    "( 1988 ) , although it is on the x - ray bright side of the distribution for such a stellar type . in figure  2b",
    "this star is the brightest one within the highest _ rosat _ contour .",
    "it is also possible that the point source is a compact object orbiting one of the stars in the cluster ngc  5281 .",
    "there is even a more intriguing possibility , that the point source is related to the snr itself .",
    "given that the absorbing column density found is similar to that towards the remnant ( see section  3.2 and table  2 ) , it is reasonable to expect the point source to be at the same distance as the remnant .",
    "the photon index of the point source is broadly consistent with a pulsar or synchrotron nebula interpretation . to search for pulsations from this source we chose a region @xmath35 in radius in the gis data to maximize the signal to noise , yielding 177 counts total in the two gis instruments , with as much as 20% contamination from the snr and cosmic x - ray background .",

    "the emission from the unresolved source spreads over the field of view and significantly contaminates the remnant emission . as a consequence ,",
    "the spectral analysis of g309.2@xmath00.6 requires special careful treatment",
    ".    for g309.2@xmath00.6 , spectra from two source regions were extracted , one circular region of radius 0.95@xmath16 which contained the most obvious emission from the point source , and another which excluded this region , and contained the full extent of the remnant as seen in the 1.0 - 3.2  kev band , with a radius of 5.6@xmath16 .",
    "the spectra and response functions from the two sis instruments were combined in the same manner as for g337.2@xmath00.7 , and routine background subtraction was done using the high galactic latitude background files .    for g309.2@xmath00.6",
    ", we also extracted control regions to model the galactic ridge background , but we found only one region with significant counts after subtracting the cosmic background and this region s emission could easily be attributed to instrumental scattering from the supernova remnant and the point source . therefore no additional galactic ridge background was subtracted for g309.2@xmath00.6 .",
    "the primary source of contamination to the _ asca _ sis spectrum of g309.2@xmath00.6 comes from the point source . to model how the psf of _ asca _ behaves at this particular position on the chip as a function of energy",
    ", we chose to investigate archival data of an isolated point source observed at a similar position on the chip in the same observational configuration as our data .",
    "the cataclysmic variable source , ss cyg ( _ asca _ seq .",
    "30001000 ) , was found to be a reasonable match , most notably in the respect that the source is the same distance from the chip gap .",
    "this source is also bright , so there are sufficient counts to use it to model the psf .",
    "using regions nominally identical in size and position to those of the g309.2@xmath00.6 point source and remnant regions , we found the ratio of counts in the inner smaller region to the outer region for each energy bin .",
    "we then used this ratio to model the contamination from the g309.2@xmath00.6 point source into the snr region .",
    "the contamination spectrum was modeled with an absorbed powerlaw and this powerlaw was used as one of the components for the model of the snr emission .",
    "it should be noted that the ratio was not strongly dependent on photon energy , and that merely renormalizing the original point source powerlaw model by an appropriate amount gave a reasonable fit for the modeled snr contamination spectrum .",
    "various sources of systematic error in the model of the point source contamination were investigated , that could either increase ( @xmath4 ) or reduce ( @xmath0 ) the contamination from the point source into the snr region .",
    "these were as follows : ( 1 ) small changes in the positions of the extraction regions for the point source ( @xmath96% ) and the snr ( @xmath46% ) based on the ss cyg data , ( 2 ) contamination of the point source by snr emission that falls in the point source region ( @xmath02% to @xmath010% ) ) , and ( 3 ) including a galactic ridge background component ( @xmath414% ) . to account for these possible sources of error ,",
    "we have investigated both the nominal model for the contamination discussed above as well as a model in which the contaminating flux has been decreased by 10% .",
    "however , we can safely ignore a model with the contaminating flux increased by even as little as a few percent since this would overpredict the emission from the remnant region below 1  kev and above 3.2  kev .",
    "we modeled the emission from each remnant with a nonequilibrium ionization ( nei ) model .",
    "the nei model used in this analysis is the single - temperature , single - timescale model from hughes & singh ( 1994 ) which assumes that the snr emission can be described by an average temperature @xmath37 and ionization timescale @xmath38 , which parameterizes the departure from ionization equilibrium .",
    "the elements included in this study are h , he , c , n , o , ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca , and fe whose baseline solar abundances are as given by raymond & smith ( 1977 ) : 12.0 , 10.93 , 8.52 , 7.96 , 8.82 , 7.92 , 7.42 , 7.52 , 7.2 , 6.9 , 6.3 , 7.6 dex respectively .",
    "we note that the inferred abundances are model dependent , however the basic conclusions should remain unchanged .",
    "we explored models with three different sets of elemental abundances in our nei spectral fits .",
    "first , the abundances of all the elements were fixed at their solar values to determine a baseline model fit .",
    "next , the overall metallicity was allowed to vary freely , i.e. the h and he abundances were fixed at their solar values , and the abundances of all higher z elements were allowed to vary , but with abundances fixed relative to one another . in our final model , which we refer to as the varying abundances model , c , n , and o were fixed to their solar abundances , ne and mg were varied together , while si , s , ar , ca and fe were each individually allowed to vary freely .",
    "the rationale behind this prescription is the following : the emission lines of c , n , and o are below or at the lower limits of the detected energy range so that they have little or no effect on the results . the emission lines from ne and mg , although detectable , are highly absorbed so they are weak and independent determination of each abundance separately is not well constrained .",
    "for g337.2@xmath00.7 the observed ratio of ne to mg was similar to the solar ratio when both were allowed to be free , but neither was tightly constrained in this method , so we tied their abundances together .",
    "for g309.2@xmath00.6 the abundance of ne was not individually constrained in any way , so it could have been set to solar abundance . however , since the preferred ratio of ne to mg abundance was close to solar , for g309.2@xmath00.6 , we chose to link the ne abundance to the mg abundance as was done for g337.2@xmath00.7 .",
    "si , s , ar , ca , and fe abundances were allowed to vary freely because they have detectable emission lines in the _ asca _ sis x - ray band , even for a highly absorbed source .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectrum ] shows the combined sis spectra from g337.2@xmath00.7 with the best - fit spectral model ( see below ) .",
    "the most obvious features of this spectrum are the emission lines of si , s and ar , as indicated on figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the lines themselves are each an amalgam of multiple emission lines of different ionic species , whose individual lines are not resolved at this spectral resolution . due to degradation of the ccd he - like and h - like lines are no longer resolvable from each other .",
    "for instance , the feature around 1.9  kev contains k@xmath1 ( @xmath39 ) lines predominantly of he - like and h - like si .",
    "this line blend is quite strong . using a simple bremsstrahlung continuum and three gaussian lines with an absorbing column we find that the equivalent widths ( ews ) for the si , s and ar k@xmath1 line complexes of g337.2@xmath00.7 are about 660 , 570 , and 320 ev , respectively ( @xmath40  ev at 1@xmath17 ) . in comparison , the maximum equivalent widths for a solar abundance plasma , ew@xmath41 , for si , s , and ar for temperatures between 0.4 and 5.0 kev , any ionization timescale , and any absorbing column density are 550 , 350 , 400 ev respectively . from this",
    "we can immediately see that si and s are significantly enhanced in g337.2@xmath00.7 . additionally , the temperatures , timescales and column densities at which the ew@xmath41 are found are not consistent with the data .",
    "for example the modeled energies of the lines are different from those in the gaussian line fits indicating that the modeled ionization state is not correct and the line ratios between the different atomic species are dissimilar from those found in g337.2@xmath00.7 .    for g337.2@xmath00.7 ,",
    "the various spectral models yield the following .",
    "with all the abundances fixed to their solar values the best - fit @xmath21 is 170.5 ( 73 degrees of freedom ) , clearly not a good fit .",
    "the model with a single variable metallicity prefers an extremely large metallicity ( 7 times solar ) and does slightly better at fitting the spectra than the solar abundance model with a @xmath21 of 155.7 ( 72 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "both these models have @xmath42 0.7 kev , @xmath43 @xmath44 yr , and @xmath45 atoms cm@xmath6 . with similar temperature , timescale and absorbing column density ( see table  [ ta : best - fit2 ] )",
    ", the varying abundances model provides a much improved description of the spectrum .",
    "it yields a best - fit @xmath21 of 103.1 ( 67 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "this reduction in @xmath21 implies a f@xmath46-stat confidence level for the addition of six new parameters ( compared to the solar model ) of 99.5% .",
    "si , s and ar are all significantly overabundant compared to their solar values confirming what we found above from the line equivalent widths , whereas the best - fit abundance of ne and mg is zero .    using the varying abundances model , we mapped the allowed region of parameter space for temperature and ionization timescale .",
    "as given in table  [ ta : best - fit2 ] , the 1@xmath17 range of @xmath37 and @xmath38 is @xmath47  kev and @xmath48  @xmath44  yr .",
    "note that the upper limit on @xmath38 is simply the value at which the equilibrium ionization fractions are attained .",
    "we see that a low temperature and near equilibrium ionization fractions are preferred . the h density , corresponding to the best - fit emission integral is @xmath49  atoms  @xmath44 scaled to a nominal distance of 10  kpc ( see section  4 ) .",

    "furthermore , the overabundance of si , s , ar and ca hold true throughout the entire allowed 3@xmath17 range on @xmath37 .",
    "in addition to these enhanced abundances , further evidence for the unusual nature of the emission comes from the non - solar ratio of ne and mg to si .",
    "although the absolute abundances of ne and mg are allowed to be greater than solar , the ratio of their abundance to si is constrained to be less than 0.2 times the solar ratio at 1@xmath17 .",

    "g309.2@xmath00.6 also requires non - solar relative abundances .",
    "models with solar abundances or a single variable metallicity do not provide a good fit to the spectrum , for either point - source contamination model ( i.e. nominal or one with 10% less contamination ) . in the case with nominal contamination ,",
    "the best - fit solar abundance model and single variable metallicity model have @xmath21 ( d.o.f . )",
    "values of 111.0 ( 59 ) and 100.4 ( 58 ) respectively with @xmath42 0.5  kev , @xmath59 @xmath44 yr , and @xmath60 atoms cm@xmath6 .",
    "this should be compared to a @xmath21 of 49.4 ( 53 ) for the varying abundance model ( see table  [ ta : best - fit4 ] ) .",
    "this large reduction in @xmath21 corresponds to an f@xmath46-stat confidence level for the addition of these six new parameters ( compared to the solar abundance model ) of 99.5% .",
    "our spectral fits for g309.2@xmath00.6 require extremely enhanced abundances .",
    "the best - fit value for the single variable metallicity is effectively infinite ( @xmath611000 ) : in other words , the minimum @xmath21 is found when emission from h and he becomes negligible .",
    "similarly , high values are also found for the varying abundances model ( see table  [ ta : best - fit4 ] ) . at a minimum , ne , mg , si , s and ar are highly over - abundant , with lower limits of 2.0 , 2.0 , 10.9 , 11.9 and 2.9 respectively ( where this lower limit derives from the 1@xmath17 errors on the model with 10% less contamination than the nominal case ) . in fact a pure - metal plasma , composed of only those elements with obvious emission lines in this band is easily allowed within the 1@xmath17 limits of either contamination model .",
    "the relative elemental abundances quoted in table  [ ta : best - fit4 ] are also highly non - solar . in particular , the abundances of ne , mg , ca and fe relative to si are all less than half the solar ratios .    for g309.2@xmath00.6 , where a pure metal plasma of just ne , mg , si , s , ar , ca and fe is allowed , it is apparent that the relevant abundance parameters to study are the abundance ratios to si , not to h. in figure [ fig : ktvary309 ] , we plot @xmath21 , the ionization timescale , and the abundance ratios with si as a function of @xmath37 over a wide range , for both contamination models .",
    "we note that throughout this range in @xmath37 the si abundance is greater than 34 and 11.9 at the 1@xmath17 level for the nominal and 10% less contamination models respectively and moreover , must be greater than 6.5 and 3.9 respectively at the 99% confidence level .",
    "the pattern of variations here is similar to that for g337.2@xmath00.7 : fe is only allowed for low temperatures , where ne and mg are at a local minimum , and the other relative abundances remain fairly constant throughout the range of parameter space .",
    "si , s , ar , ne and mg are all highly overabundant compared to solar over the entire range of @xmath37 . in figure  [ fig : abund309 ] we present the best fit values and 1@xmath17 limits on the relative metal abundances in the form , ( z / si)@xmath51[(si / h)@xmath52/(z / h)@xmath53 $ ] , for both the nominal and the 10%-less contamination model .",
    "this figure also illustrates the dominance of si and s emission and relative underabundance of ne , mg , ar , ca , and fe .",
    "the effect of the point source contamination on the derived abundances is important to note .",
    "as one might expect , since less of the continuum emission has been accounted for , the 10%-less contamination model yields lower abundances relative to h than the nominal contamination model does .",
    "however the abundances relative to si are somewhat higher .",
    "yet , the pattern of the relative abundances remains qualitatively the same , and the enhanced abundances persist even without any contamination model .",
    "we note that the 10%-less contamination model does a marginally better job of fitting the data ( @xmath21 of 48.6 vs. 49.4 ) but the difference in @xmath21 is not significant .",
    "verification of our model for the point - source contamination of g309.2@xmath00.6 comes from examining the _ rosat _ data on this remnant .",
    "the psf of _ rosat _ is much finer than _ asca _ and hence we expect very little contamination of the snr emission from the point source .",
    "after background subtraction , the _ rosat _ spectrum for the remnant shows very little emission below 1 kev ( count rate = 0.01@xmath90.004 counts s@xmath7 , between 0.5@xmath01.0 kev compared to 0.07@xmath90.006 counts s@xmath7 for 0.5@xmath02.0 kev ) , which agrees with our model that point source contamination is causing effectively all the emission below 1  kev for the _ asca _ data .",
    "modeling the _ rosat _ snr emission with the best - fit model for just the snr emission in _ asca _ , gives a slightly better @xmath21 than a model assuming that what we define as contamination from the point source is actually snr emission .",
    "unfortunately , the @xmath21 difference is not great enough to allow us to discriminate between these two cases .",
    "however we can conclude that our point source contamination models are fully consistent with the _ rosat _ data .    the dynamical parameters for g309.2@xmath00.6 are less well constrained than for g337.2 - 0.7 , because of the complication of the contaminating point source .",
    "nevertheless the best - fit values of @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath62 are all quite reasonable .",
    "g309.2@xmath00.6 appears to have a somewhat higher temperature than g337.2 - 0.7 ( 1 - 2 kev vs. 0.8 - 0.9 kev ) .",
    "the ionization timescales for the two snrs are consistent with each other and the 1@xmath17 ranges allow for equilibrium ionization for both remnants .",
    "g309.2@xmath00.6 has a low absorbing column density , n@xmath63 , @xmath64  atoms  cm@xmath6 , similar to that found for the unresolved source , indicating that they are at approximately the same distance .",
    "the number density of hydrogen atoms , corresponding to the best - fit emission integral and a nominal distance of 5.4  kpc is very low , @xmath65=@xmath66  atoms  @xmath44 , reflecting the fact that hydrogen is not the dominant element in the x - ray emitting plasma as it would be under usual solar abundance conditions .",
    "given the absorbing hydrogen column density measured from our x - ray spectra , it is possible to estimate the distances to g309.2@xmath00.6 and g337.2@xmath00.7 . following chen et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) , given a hydrogen column density , @xmath67 , the relation between column density and optical color excess , @xmath68 ( predehl & schmitt 1995 ) and the extinction per unit distance , @xmath69 , in the direction of a remnant one can estimate the distance to that remnant . for the extinction per unit distance , we use the contour diagrams of lucke ( 1978 ) .",
    "since these measurements were for stars within 2  kpc of the sun , and the density of absorbing material is undoubtedly greater near the galactic center , any distance estimates greater than 2  kpc in the direction towards the galactic center should be viewed as upper limits .    for g309.2@xmath00.6 , with @xmath70 , @xmath71  mag  kpc@xmath7 , we find @xmath72  kpc .",
    "the distance thus found for g309.2@xmath00.6 , is consistent with the lower range of distances found by ggm , 5.4@xmath91.6  kpc , which was found from absorption toward the remnant itself .",
    "this distance is consistent with that of the region , rcw80 lying @xmath73 north of g309.2@xmath00.6 , as well as the location of the scutum - crux spiral arm of the galaxy . furthermore , for a distance of 5.4  kpc , ggm estimate an age of less than 4000 years and size of @xmath39.5  pc in radius which is more consistent with its ejecta - dominated nature than a larger distance would be .",
    "for the point source in g309.2@xmath00.6 , 1wga j1346.5@xmath06255 , which has @xmath74  atoms  cm@xmath6 we find @xmath75  kpc , broadly consistent with the x - ray estimated distance to the snr , but also consistent with the distance to the cluster ngc 5281 ( 1.3  kpc , moffat & vogt 1973 ) .",
    "the @xmath76 atoms cm@xmath6 and @xmath77  mag  kpc@xmath7 of g337.2@xmath00.7 yield a distance upper limit of 15.5@xmath78  kpc .",
    "this is much further than the applicability of the extinction per unit distance estimate , but is useful as an upper limit . in the direction of g337.2@xmath00.7",
    "the measured total column density is rather high , @xmath3@xmath79  atoms  cm@xmath6 ; much of this material is likely to be distributed in molecular clouds and other dense regions in the perseus , scutum - crux and norma spiral arms and the 5 kpc molecular ring . since a single large molecular cloud along the line of sight could be sufficient to account for all the x - ray absorption we see ( e.g. , corbel  et  al .",
    "1999 ) , we can , at this time , only surmise that g337.2@xmath00.7 is somewhere between the near and far sides of the norma spiral arm at @xmath35  kpc and @xmath315  kpc",
    ". measurements of the intensities and velocities of co emission towards this remnant would allow us to determine the distribution of material along the line - of - sight .",
    "combined with the x - ray column density , we could then estimate the remnant s distance , as has been recently done by corbel  et  al .",
    "( 1999 ) for snr g337.0@xmath00.1 .",
    "in addition , radio measurements of absorption to g337.2@xmath00.7 should be pursued as another constraint on its distance .",
    "for purposes of estimation in this work , we use a nominal distance of 10  kpc .    given our distance estimates , we can place rough limits on the ages of the remnants . by assuming free - expansion at some typical velocity ( 5000  km  s@xmath7 ) we can place a lower limit on the time since the explosion . for g337.2@xmath00.7 ,",
    "distances of 10 and 15  kpc yield a lower limit of between 1700 and 2600 years . for g309.2@xmath00.6",
    "a distance of 4@xmath92  kpc corresponds to a lower limit on the age of between 700 and 2000 years .",
    "since our abundances indicate that these remnants are not yet in the sedov phase , a nominal sedov solution provides upper limits on the ages ( see for instance hamilton , sarazin , & chevalier 1983 ; hughes , hayashi , & koyama 1998 ) .",
    "this is because a sedov solution would imply that the outer shock has been decelerated by the ambient medium more than we would expect for a remnant still dominated by emission from ejecta . for both remnants",
    "we assume an ambient density , @xmath80  @xmath44 , and explosion energy , @xmath81  ergs ; derived ages scale as @xmath82 . at the upper limits of our distances we find that g337.2@xmath00.7 is less than @xmath83 years old and g309.2@xmath00.6 is less than @xmath84 years old ( the latter as previously reported by ggm ) .",
    "these age estimates are nicely consistent with the ejecta - dominated nature of these remnants , and furthermore any distances closer than these rough upper limits would imply correspondingly younger ages .",
    "however , since they are based on merely nominal values of the velocity , explosion energy and density , they should not be over - interpreted .",
    "future observations with _",
    "chandra _ or _ xmm - newton _ will be able to determine the blastwave temperature and emission measure ( as opposed to the ejecta temperature and emission measure found here ) so that we can solve for the actual @xmath85 , @xmath86 and shock velocity , and directly constrain the ages of these remnants .",
    "one would like to use the abundance ratios found in our spectral fits to determine the types of sn that formed each of these remnants .",
    "however , snrs are spatially complex and undergo significant temporal evolution so that we do not expect all the ejecta to be at the same thermodynamic state , the reverse shock to have thermalized all the ejecta at the same time , or even for the ejecta to be uniformly distributed .",
    "in fact recent experience with _",
    "data from cassiopeia a ( hughes et  al . 2000 ) has shown that for this type ii sne , different nucleosynthetic burning products from distinct layers of the progenitor star are seen with differing thermodynamic states and at widely separate positions in the remnant . therefore our fitted abundances , based on a single temperature , single timescale model , at best give only a rough indication of the total nucleosynthetic yields .    with the preceding caveats in mind , in figures  [ fig : abund ] &  [ fig : abund309 ] , we compare the best - fit relative abundances for g337.2@xmath00.7 and g309.2@xmath00.6 , to nucleosynthesis models of type ia and ii explosions from nomoto et  al .",
    "( 1997 ) , thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto ( 1996 ) and woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) .",
    "only the few cases that gave reasonable fits are shown .",
    "the abundance ratios for g337.2@xmath00.7 , are a decent match to the sn ia model w7 ( nomoto et  al .",
    "type ia produce very small quantities of low z elements such as ne and mg , and more si - group elements such as s , ar and ca , which fits well with the g337.2@xmath00.7 abundance patterns .",
    "the fe abundance is less than that expected from the total nucleosynthetic yield , but this could simply be because the entire fe - rich core has not yet been shocked .",
    "a low - mass sn ii core - collapse model , for instance the 13  @xmath87 model of thielemann , nomoto , & hashimoto ( 1996 ) ( labeled tnh  13  @xmath87 ) , is the next best fit for g337.2@xmath00.7 .",
    "the shortcoming of this model is its overprediction of the ne and mg abundances .",
    "however , since the low abundance of ne and mg is more strongly constrained than the fe abundance , we slightly prefer the sn ia model .    for g309.2@xmath00.6 ,",
    "the case is less clear .",
    "the closest model is a 15  @xmath87 sn ii model of woosley & weaver ( 1995 ) ( labeled ww  15  @xmath87 ) , chosen for its low fe abundance and high s abundance .",
    "the presence of significant ne and mg also argues for a sn ii model .",
    "however , it is clear that a global nucleosynthetic yield is an unreasonable model since there is no evidence for fe .",
    "determining the type of the progenitor of this remnant will require further investigation . if for instance the point source in the x - ray image of g309.2@xmath00.6 were confirmed to be associated with the remnant and shown to be a compact remnant that would clinch its origin as a core - collapse sn .",
    "the enhanced abundances derived from the strong x - ray emission lines of highly ionized si , s and ar reveal the ejecta - dominated nature of both g337.2@xmath00.7 and g309.2@xmath00.6 .",
    "the ews of the si and s lines for both remnants are greater than the maximum possible ews for solar abundance plasmas with temperatures between 0.4 and 5.0 kev .",
    "in addition the prominence of these lines compared to the ne and mg lines , requires non - solar abundance ratios .    using nonequilibrium ionization thermal plasma spectral models we derive abundances for these remnants that are highly non - solar . over the entire range in temperatures and ionization timescales , the abundances of si ,",
    "s , ar and ca are many times the solar values for g337.2@xmath00.7 and for g309.2@xmath00.6 a pure metal plasma of only ne , mg , si , s and ar ( i.e. , no h or he ) is allowed .",
    "in addition , the elemental abundances are not well described by a single multiplicative factor times their solar abundances . for g337.2@xmath00.7 ,",
    "ne , mg , and possibly fe are significantly underabundant relative to the si - group elements . for g309.2@xmath00.6",
    "ne , mg , ar , ca and fe are all underabundant compared to si and s. we thus conclude that g337.2@xmath00.7 and g309.2@xmath00.6 are new examples of ejecta - dominated remnants .",
    "furthermore our spectral fits provide us with a measure of the column densities to each remnant , which when coupled to estimates of the absorption as a function of distance along a given line of sight , provides distance estimates for both remnants .",
    "for g309.2@xmath00.6 we find a distance of @xmath2  kpc consistent with both ggm s estimate from absorption lines , and the position of the scutum - crux spiral arm . for g337.2@xmath00.7",
    "we find an upper limit on the distance of 15  kpc , placing it no further than far side of the norma spiral arm .",
    "using these distances , we can place lower limits on the ages of the remnants by assuming free - expansion .",
    "g309.2@xmath00.6 is at least 700 to 2000 years old , while g337.2@xmath00.7 is greater than 1700 to 2600 years old . a nominal sedov solution , @xmath81  ergs , @xmath88  @xmath44 yields upper limits on the ages of 4500 years for g337.2@xmath00.7 , and 4000 years for g309.2@xmath00.6 .",
    "these age estimates corroborate our finding that both remnants are young and ejecta - dominated .",
    "we also draw attention to the x - ray point source 1wga  j1346.5@xmath06255 , apparent within the radio shell of g309.2@xmath00.6 .",
    "we found no pulsations for this source in the 0.002  hz to 32  hz frequency range , but this only limits the pulsed fraction to be less than @xmath385% .",
    "although we were able to estimate its distance using the absorbing column density , we can neither exclude the possibility that it is associated with the snr nor with the foreground open cluster ngc  5281 .",
    "higher spatial and temporal resolution observations as are possible with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _ are vital to resolve the nature of this source as well as to unambiguously distinguish between the emission from this point source and the snr itself .    continued investigation of ejecta - dominated snrs such as g337.2@xmath00.7 and g309.2@xmath00.6 is crucial .",
    "higher spectral resolution observations as will be possible with _ xmm - newton _ and _ chandra _ will allow further constraints on both the abundances and the thermodynamic state of the shocked plasma in these remnants . further , the breadth of possible investigations that take advantage of the 0.5@xmath89 spatial resolution of _ chandra _ is staggering .",
    "now it is possible to study the abundances of individual knots of ejecta and compare them with models of explosive nucleosynthesis from different layers in the exploding sn and thereby trace the dynamics of the explosion , as we have already begun for cassiopeia a ( hughes et  al .",
    "2000 ) . we can also isolate the spectrum of small - scale features in a remnant ( e.g. , the outermost blast - wave ) and thereby",
    "study how sne shocks impart energy to the ism , heat electrons and ions , generate cosmic rays , and so on ( see hughes , rakowski , & decourchelle 2000 ) . thus studies of young ejecta - dominated remnants , like those presented here , with the new generation of x - ray observatories , have the potential to make a significant impact on a number of important astrophysical questions .",
