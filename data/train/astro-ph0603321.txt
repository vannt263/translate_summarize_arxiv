    "cohen , parker & chapman ( 2005 : hereafter cpc ) have reported the discovery of a very faint planetary nebula ( pn ) centred on the long - period pulsating oh / ir star oh354.88 - 0.54 , also known as v1018  sco .",
    "the pn was found during examination of survey field ha630 of the southern h@xmath1 survey ( shs : parker et al .",
    "2005a ) by qap , as part of a systematic search for new galactic plane pne ( e.g. parker et al .",
    "2005b , 2006 ) .",
    "its oh characteristics mark this star as an intermediate mass asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) star , with initial mass @xmath2 . after rejecting the possibility that the pn arises from shock interaction with the surrounding external medium , or",
    "that the star is a  born - again \" ( e.g. , iben 1984 ) object that has undergone a very late thermal pulse ( e.g. , blcker & schnberner 1997 ) as it began to evolve along its cooling track , cpc speculated that this object represents a phase of pn evolution that has been formerly unobserved .",
    "they concluded that this star s fast wind has very recently turned on and it is the interaction between this wind and the previously shed outer layers of the star that produces the ionization that reveals the optical pn .    to explore this intriguing phenomenon further",
    "we have undertaken a series of radio continuum and water maser observations with the australia telescope compact array ( atca ) , originally with the objective of mapping out the spatial distribution of ionized material within the pn .",
    "pre - existing radio data are discussed in  2 .",
    " 3 describes the new atca continuum and h@xmath0o maser observations , while  4 shows an enhanced optical image of the pn .",
    "the discussion follows in  5 , with our conclusions in  6 .",
    "the best estimate for the position of the star itself is : 17@xmath3 35@xmath4 02.73@xmath5@xmath60.02@xmath5 , @xmath733@xmath8 33@xmath9 29.41@xmath10@xmath60.24@xmath10 ( cpc ) .",
    "neither the pmn or nvss surveys includes any continuum source within several arcmin of oh354.88 - 0.5 , while the vla survey of the inner plane at 5  ghz by becker et al .",
    "( 1994 ) is limited to @xmath11b@xmath11@xmath120.4@xmath8 .",
    "the 1.4-ghz continuum survey of small diameter sources by zoonematkermani et al .",
    "( 1990 ) does include a bright , compact radio object ( 2.4@xmath10 in size ) within 7@xmath10 of the maser position .",
    "however , this survey comprises two 3-mhz wide bands centred at 1441.5 and 1611.7  mhz , so the higher frequency band is contaminated by the strong 1612-mhz maser emission .",
    "this problem was recognized by white , becker & helfand ( 2005),who give an updated position at 20  cm of 17@xmath3 35@xmath4 02.590@xmath5 @xmath733@xmath8 33@xmath9 31.18@xmath10 ( j2000 ) and warn of this contamination of their band - averaged flux densities .",
    "zijlstra et al .",
    "( 1989 ) quote an upper limit of 1.4 mjy at 2  cm from a vla observation in september 1986 .",
    "consequently , the only radio survey to have correctly detected and assessed the continuum from oh354.88 - 0.5 is the first molonglo galactic plane survey ( mgps1 : green _ et al .",
    "_ 1999 ) , at 843  mhz .",
    "extracting the individual mgps1 images , from which the final survey images were constructed , shows a source at the maser position . fitting a 2d - gaussian to",
    "the object indicates an unresolved source with an 843-mhz flux density of 10.8@xmath60.6  mjy , located at 17@xmath3 35@xmath4 01.52@xmath5 @xmath733@xmath8 33@xmath9 36.90@xmath10 ( j2000 ) the beam size of the molongolo observatory synthesis telescope at this location is 75@xmath10 ( n - s ) by 43@xmath10 ( e - w ) so the radio emission could occupy the full extent of the h@xmath1 ring ( roughly a 39@xmath10 circle as shown by the images in  4 ) yet still be unresolved in mgps1 images .",
    "therefore , observations with the atca were planned .",
    "short test observations were carried out with the atca in the continuum at 3 and 6  cm in december 2003 to determine whether emission could be detected .",
    "the atca has six 22-m diameter antennas with five of the antennas located on an east - west track of length 3  km .",
    "the sixth antenna lies 3  km further west giving a maximum baseline of 6  km .",
    "further continuum observations were made at 3 , 6 , 13 and 20  cm in 2004@xmath72005 . only oh and sio masers were known for oh354.88 - 0.54 . therefore , we investigated the h@xmath0o maser line at 22235  mhz in november 2004 with a short observation that yielded a solid detection .",
    "we later followed up with a 12-h observation in june 2005 with the intention of imaging the water maser emission and to search for continuum emission at 22235  mhz .",
    "table  1 summarizes our new continuum observations .",
    "we refer to the observing bands as 1.35 , 3 , 6 , 13 and 20  cm .",
    "the actual frequencies used were : 22235 , 8640 , 4800 , 2368 , and 1384  mhz .",

    "the observations of the source were interleaved with short observations of a secondary calibrator source ( 1729 - 37 for 3 , 6 , 13 and 20  cm , and 1710 - 269 for 1.35  cm ) .",
    "the flux density scale and bandpass calibrations were applied from observations of the source 1934 - 638 which is the primary flux calibrator for the atca .",

    "figure  [ water ] represents the discovery of h@xmath0o maser emission from oh354.88 - 0.54 , from a 40-minute observation taken in november 2004 .",
    "two peaks are seen at velocities ( lsr ) of @xmath74.8 and + 22.2  km  s@xmath13 , significantly displaced by 1 - 2  km  s@xmath13 from the corresponding oh maser peaks ( @xmath75.5 and + 24.3 km  s@xmath13 , respectively : cpc ) .",
    "the blue peak is the stronger with a flux density of 0.31  jy ; the red peak has a flux density of 0.21  jy . from these limited data we were unable to measure the maser positions .",
    "we can infer only that we observed two blobs of water maser emission , but we can not interpret the peak velocity differences in terms of relative locations of the masing species .",
    "it is also noteworthy that the water maser profile is significantly above zero in the centre , similar to the oh profile ( cpc ) .    despite the 12-h track obtained during the june 2005 atca observation , we had a non - detection of any water maser emission with a 5@xmath14 limit of @xmath1540  mjy . extrapolating from figure  3 of cpc we estimate that we detected water masers at an oh maser phase of 0.57 but failed at a phase of 0.72 .",
    "this interval is such a small fraction of a period that the source must be highly variable and the water masers clearly do not follow the very regular oh maser variations .",
    "the range of variation in h@xmath0o maser intensity from the 2004 to the 2005 observation was about a factor of 8 .",
    "we looked for radio continuum emission at 1.35  cm using the spectral line data but achieved no detection , with a 5@xmath14 upper limit of 1.65  mjy .",
    "figure  [ quotpsf ] represents a quotient map obtained directly from supercosmos data for the pn by dividing the h@xmath1 pixel data by the corresponding data from the short - red ( sr ) exposure .",
    "however , it also involves use of the bond et al .",
    "( 2002 ) technique of variable point - spread - function ( psf ) matching between the two images prior to division .",
    "this enhances the faint nebula by effectively removing most of the emission from point sources in the field .",
    "the figure shows that the outer boundary of the pn is quite sharply defined around most of its circumference .",
    "emission can clearly be seen above the sky over most of its projected area although the brightening of the south - eastern region is particularly striking .",
    "there is also the suggestion of a northward extension although this is very faint and merges imperceptibly with the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    ". the north - south extent could be as much as 20% greater than the east - west diameter in this newly processed image .",
    "[ optrad ] shows the relationship between sources a and b and the pn in the plane of the sky .",
    "an old ukst h@xmath1 plate which includes the pn region exists in the archive .",
    "this exposure ( ha2307 ) was taken in 1976 for john meaburn on fast but coarse - grained o-9804 emulsion with a mosaic h@xmath1 filter .",
    "the enhanced south - east section of the pn is clearly visible on this old exposure but the remaining boundary is hard to discern .",
    "this , coupled with the poorer resolution of this exposure , make it essentialy impossible to measure whether there has been any expansion of the nebula ring over the intervening 20-plus years .",
    "nonthermal emission from early - type stars was found in wolf - rayet stars ( wrs ) by abbott , bieging , & churchwell 1984 ; abbott et al .",
    "1986 ; bieging et al .",
    "its origin lies in the acceleration , by strong shocks , of a small population of relativistic electrons ( white 1985 ) . in wr binary systems",
    "these shocks arise from the collision of the separate winds of the two components .",
    "it is less certain whether the phenomenon occurs in single wr stars .",
    "the paradigm applied to oh354.88 - 0.54 involves a single star but two stellar winds from different phases of evolution .",
    "absorption of synchrotron emission has been observed in colliding winds from wrs by chapman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , who attributed this to thermal absorption by gas along the line - of - sight through the ionized wind . the observed continuum energy distribution for wr48 ( chapman et al .",
    "1999 , fig .",
    "11 ) reveals nonthermal emission between 3 and 13  cm but only an upper limit at 20  cm , implying a pronounced turnover longward of @xmath1513  cm .",
    "these authors separated the thermal and nonthermal contributions to the spectrum of wr48 and found the nonthermal component to have a slope of @xmath70.83 .",
    "this slope matches that for oh354.88 - 0.54 sources a and b ( within the errors ) , strongly suggesting that we may be viewing nonthermal emission in this pn that is also caused by the collision of two winds , the low density , high velocity pn fast wind and the high density , slowly moving original pn ejecta .",
    "synchrotron self - absorption is unimportant in sources with brightness temperature below 10@xmath16  k ( condon 1992 ) but thermal absorption within the pn is still relevant and could cause the abrupt turn - down in the spectrum of source b. locating source a near the front side of the pn , as we view it , would account for the lack of absorption in its radio spectrum .",
    "the psf - subtracted image of the pn ( fig .  [ quotpsf ] ) indicates that the h@xmath1 brightness varies significantly across the pn suggesting that the electron density also varies .",
    "it is also possible that the southern rim of the pn is brightest because the pn s slow wind suffers a shock at the interface with the ism .",
    "source a lies within the western portion of the brightest ( southern ) region of h@xmath1 emission , for which cpc determined n@xmath17  @xmath154000  @xmath18 , whereas b appears in an area of much lower h@xmath1 brightness to the north ( fig .",
    "[ quotpsf ] ) .",
    "we can use the turnover in source b s radio spectrum to estimate the mean electron density through the nebula in its direction .",
    "the thermal optical depth through the nebula may be calculated following mezger & henderson ( 1967 , eqn ( 5 ) ) , and rearranged into an expression for the turnover frequency ( in ghz ) , @xmath19@xmath200.3(t@xmath21n@xmath22l)@xmath23 ( lang 1999 , eqn.1.224 ) , where l is the path length through the pn in pc ( we adopt the diameter of the pn , 1.9@xmath2410@xmath25  cm , 0.6  pc , for l : note that cpc s table  1 gave the diameter as 0.3  pc ; this was in fact the radius ) .",
    "the turnover wavelength must lie beyond 13  cm but be less than 20  cm , so @xmath19 must lie between 1.5 and 2.3  ghz . taking t@xmath17@xmath1510@xmath26  k ,",
    "we conclude that the mean nebular n@xmath17 along the line - of - sight toward b is between 3200 and 4900  @xmath18 , in excellent agreement with the density derived from the [ sii ] lines ( 4000  @xmath18 : cpc ) .",
    "we also consider whether the apparent excess of 3-cm emission in b , above the nonthermal slope , might be due to free - free emission , as seen in wr stars .",
    "firstly we have separately analyzed the two 3-cm data sets to investigate the reality of this excess by fitting a point source to the calibrated u - v data .",
    "this should give a more reliable flux estimate than fitting in the image plane , if there were no confusion and the emission were unresolved .",
    "we find 0.61@xmath60.03  mjy ( jan 2004 ) and 0.59@xmath60.03  mjy ( dec 2004 ) , where the errors are the rms residuals from the fitting process alone .",
    "our measurement of the same value at two epochs separated by nearly a year gives strong support for the reality of the measured flux density .",
    "extrapolating source b s nonthermal spectrum to 3  cm implies a level of 0.31  mjy .",
    "therefore , we conclude that b shows a real excess at 3  cm of 0.29  mjy .    to estimate the expected radio free - free level we have applied an absolute calibration to the h@xmath1 image of the nebula according the method described by pierce ( 2006 ) , in which a scaled continuum ( sr ) image",
    "is subtracted from the h@xmath1 image , and a factor is applied to relate the shs difference image to the spatially much lower - resolution , but absolutely calibrated , southern h@xmath1 sky survey atlas ( shassa : gaustad et al .",
    "2001 ) . for this pn , the sr scale is 0.99 and the conversion factor in this field is 14.9  counts  pixel@xmath13  per rayleigh .",
    "integrating the entire pn spatially , subtracting background sky ( assessed as the average of that measured in four different locations to provide a robust background ) and three point sources interior to , or on the rim of , the nebula , and after correction for the 36% contribution of the red [ nii ] line to the emission in the bandpass of the shs h@xmath1 filter , we derive 3.6  rayleighs in h@xmath1 alone .",
    "this is equivalent to 2.4@xmath2410@xmath27  erg  @xmath28  s@xmath13 .",
    "we now require the total extinction to the pn . based on fitzgerald ( 1968 ) , lucke ( 1978 ) and especially on neckel & klare ( 1980 )",
    ", we find a@xmath29@xmath203.5 in this direction , corresponding to a@xmath30 @xmath202.8 .",
    "thus the intrinsic h@xmath1 flux is 3.3@xmath2410@xmath31  erg  @xmath28  s@xmath13 , and the corresponding h@xmath32 flux would be 1.1@xmath2410@xmath31  erg  @xmath28  s@xmath13 .",
    "this is convertible into the radio free - free flux density using condon ( 1992 : eqns .",
    "( 3 ) and ( 4a ) ) .",
    "the estimated free - free emission at 3  cm , for the entire nebula , is 0.33  mjy and this is comparable to the excess emission detected at 3  cm .",
    "source b was unresolved and thus only occupies a small part ( less than about 2% ) of the nebular area . for a uniform distribution",
    "the predicted free - free emission from source b would be less than 0.01  mjy .",
    "however , one would expect the radio thermal emission to follow the h@xmath1 brightness distribution and , therefore , to be patchy .",
    "there is precedent for this in the luminous blue variable hd  168625 ( leitherer et al .",
    "1995 ) , where the radio continuum shell closely mimics the morphology of the partially filled h@xmath1 shell .",
    "if the free - free emission were highly clumped toward source b , then a larger fraction of the total thermal emission might be concentrated there .",
    "alternatively , if our line - of - sight to source b through the pn suffered significant internal extinction then the estimated intrinsic h@xmath1 emission would also increase .",
    "consequently , local overdensities of ionized gas could be offset by internal nebular extinction due to dusty clumps .",
    "for example , if 20% of the total observed free - free emission were located within source b ( an overdensity greater than a factor of 10 ) , and there were an extra extinction ( a@xmath29 ) of 2.1 magnitudes ( a@xmath30 of 1.7 mag ) within the nebula , then radio free - free emission of 0.3  mjy would still be observed .",
    "( in this case the total pn free - free emission would be 1.65  mjy , boosting the intrinsic balmer line fluxes by @xmath245 , requiring a line - of - sight a@xmath30 of 4.6 , equivalent to an a@xmath29 of 5.6  mag , of which 3.5  mag arise from the ism and 2.1  mag within the pn .",
    "the upper limit on b at 20  cm also excludes a cut - off in the electron energy spectrum because there is no intermediate regime with s@xmath33@xmath34@xmath35 between the optically thin and thick spectral indices ( ginzburg & syrovatskii 1965 ) . the fact that a and b have almost the same nonthermal slope strengthens the case for either a common volume in which we observe this nonthermal emission , or two separated volumes in which very similar strong shocks generate relativistic electrons .",
    "the fast wind , therefore , must encounter essentially the same physical conditions at the two locations in which it impacts the nebular ejecta .      both sources",
    "a and b are located within the ring and no other strong background objects are apparent .",
    "one can ask whether sources a and b are truly associated with the pn or might represent a double radio source viewed by chance along the line - of - sight .",
    "inspection of our observed images covering the atca primary beams at 20  cm ( @xmath151000  arcmin@xmath36 ) and 6  cm",
    "( @xmath1580  arcmin@xmath36 ) suggests that 7 and 3 sources , respectively , are recognizable above the noise , at all flux densities , and none appear double . calculating the formal extragalactic confusion from log  n@xmath7log  s relationships at 20 and 6  cm ( ledden et al .",
    "1980 ; bridle 1989 ) one would expect to detect 15 radio sources within the atca primary beam at 20  cm with a flux density greater than the sum of a and b , but less than one similarly within the 6-cm primary beam .",
    "the probabilities of even a single background source as bright as a appearing within the pn h@xmath1 image are approximately 1/500 ( 6  cm ) and 1/200 ( 20  cm ) .",
    "there are several other arguments that imply a physical linkage with the pn : they have statistically the same nonthermal radio spectral indices instead of the more common thermal sources found along the galactic plane ; there may be a faint connection between the emission of a and b ; and a lies very close to the edge of the pn and is clearly curved , roughly concentrically , with the rim ( fig .",
    "[ curve ] ) , making a physical interaction between a and the ejecta that define the pn rim highly plausible .",
    "we have compared our continuum observations at different epochs and see no indications of variability at any of the wavelengths observed over a period of 1.5  yr .",
    "chapman et al . ( 1999 : their table  3 ) tabulated the monochromatic 6-cm luminosity of wrs that emit nonthermal radio emission .",
    "the average of the 9 wrs detected was 2.1@xmath60.6@xmath2410@xmath37  ergs  s@xmath13  hz@xmath13 .",
    "the same calculation yields 3.7 and 0.7@xmath2410@xmath37  ergs  s@xmath13  hz@xmath13 for a and b , respectively .",
    "summing the two nonthermal sources in oh354.88 - 0.54 , the pn is more luminous than the average nonthermal wr emitter . adding a and b we find that the approximate nonthermal radio luminosity ( for an adopted bandwidth of 10  ghz ; cf .",

    "oh354.88 - 0.54 has not been detected based on a search of x - ray and @xmath39-ray catalogues .",
    "in particular , chandra has not observed in its direction .",
    "we now compare oh354.88 - 0.54 with wr stars , for which a typical radio luminosity is a few @xmath40  ergs  s@xmath13 .",
    "the total kinetic energy ( ke ) flux calculated from the known mass loss rates ( m ) of wrs ( a few @xmath2410@xmath41  m@xmath42  yr@xmath13 ) and wind velocities ( v@xmath43@xmath152000  km  s@xmath13 ) , @xmath44 m  v@xmath43@xmath36 , is typically 6@xmath2410@xmath45  ergs  s@xmath13 . for a wr@xmath7o - star collision",
    "about 0.3% of the flux passes through the interaction region , so the ke flux at the interaction is about 2@xmath2410@xmath46  ergs  s@xmath13 ( see chapman et al .",
    "( 1999 ) for details ) .    for the detected continuum sources a and b , the 5-ghz radio luminosity is 4.4@xmath2410@xmath37  ergs  s@xmath13  hz@xmath13 and the total integrated radio luminosity ( l@xmath47 ) is thus about 4.4@xmath2410@xmath38  ergs  s@xmath13 .",
    "we assume that the ratio of ke flux / radio luminosity is the same as for wr stars ( about 10@xmath48:1 ) .",
    "thus approximately 4.4@xmath2410@xmath46  ergs  s@xmath13 should be available at the shock regions . by comparison with wr binaries ,",
    "the total ke flux of the fast wind of oh354.88 - 0.54 is not well determined as we do not know what fraction of the fast wind encounters the shocked regions .",
    "source a occupies about 1/100 of the total shell area ( estimated at 6  cm ) while source b is smaller . for a smooth distribution",
    "this suggests that the ke could be about 100@xmath24 higher than at the shock .",
    "however , if the fast wind is clumpy or asymmetric then this is likely to be considerably overestimated .",
    "as an example , we consider a scenario where 10% of the total ke flux reaches the detected shocked regions giving a total ke flux of 4.4@xmath2410@xmath49  ergs  s@xmath13 . for v@xmath50 , the velocity of the fast wind , we adopt 1000  km  s@xmath13 . from these values we can crudely estimate the mass - loss rate of the fast wind to be m@xmath50@xmath201.2@xmath2410@xmath41  m@xmath42  yr@xmath13 .",
    "we now estimate the velocity of the compressed shell ( v@xmath51 ) for this mass - loss rate . from eqn.(9 ) of zijlstra et al .",

    "the velocity of the compressed shell is @xmath1560  km  s@xmath13 and this can be compared to the observed line - of - sight optical velocity of 20  km  s@xmath13 . if less than 10% of the total energy flux reaches the shocked regions then both m@xmath50 and v@xmath51 would be higher while ,",
    "if a larger fraction of the energy flux were intercepted , then m@xmath50 and v@xmath51 would be lower .      despite the roughness of these estimates they do provide an idea of the relevant interactions .",
    "the fast wind ploughs into the slow agb wind creating shocks , non - thermal emission and a compressed shell on the inner face .",
    "if the fast wind has a momentum ( m@xmath50@xmath24v@xmath50 ) that is roughly comparable to ( or greater than ) that of the slow wind then , when they collide , the slow wind is compressed and accelerated and this increase in velocity is indicated by the velocity of the optical emission .",
    "the shock excitation must be stronger in the compressed intranebular shell than at the ism and the rather high density derived from the red [ sii ] doublet is more suggestive of a post - shocked region rather than a typical pn envelope .",
    "therefore , it is more likely that the optical emission in the pn arises at the interface of the fast wind and agb wind , rather than at the interface of the agb wind and the ism .",
    "the geometry of the emerging fast wind is unknown because any spherically symmetric flow from the star would be immediately modified by its encounter with the dense circumstellar oh toroid .",
    "naively , were this toroid to constrain the fast wind to the polar directions ( north - south ) in which oh maser emission is weakest ( welty , fix & mutel 1987 ) , one might expect to see nonthermal `` hot spots '' in two opposing directions .",
    "there is evidence of a 10-@xmath53 m source around the star that is significantly elongated north - south ( cobb & fix 1987 ) but this need not trace any dynamical structure . in fact , figure  [ quotpsf ] suggests that sources a and b do not correspond to a bipolar wind encountering a spherical distribution of slowly - moving ejecta .",
    "consequently , one might have to invoke either a fast wind capable of breaking out of the oh toroid in any region of locally reduced density , or a non - spherical distribution of the original pn ejecta , or both .",
    "however , table  2 shows that both sources appear projected in the sky at the same radial distance from the central star .",
    "this is consistent with a spherical ejection for the slow wind .",
    "the natural direction for any asymmetry of the fast wind or of the original debris would be in the direction roughly from northwest to southeast of the star , based on the morphology of the h@xmath1 nebular brightness and the line bisecting sources a and b through the possible weak bridge of emission observed at 13  cm ( fig .",
    "[ 13 cm ] ) .",
    "there is also evidence for a preferred axis in the same p.a .",
    "in the oh velocity slices between @xmath55 and @xmath56  km  s@xmath13 published by welty et al .",
    "( 1987 : their fig .  15 ) . at more negative velocities",
    "the oh brightness indicates weaker oh emission along a north - south axis .",
    "none of these directions appears to be associated with the nonthermal shock zones .",
    "strong nonthermal radio continuum emission has also been observed from the oh / ir star oh326.53 - 00.419 ( also known as d046 ) , with a spectral index of @xmath57 .",
    "the oh maser emission from d046 occurs over an unusually broad range of 80  km  s@xmath13 ( sevenster & chapman 1999 ; sevenster & chapman 2005 ) .",
    "d046 appears to represent a post - agb object , in transition between the agb and pn phases .",
    "these nonthermal emitters may all arise because of the impact of fast winds on circumstellar debris near the end of agb life .",
    "oh354.88 - 0.54 s intermediate mass progenitor may confer its uniqueness , in that it is still a pulsating long - period variable after it has already created a visible pn , simply because the time scale for stellar evolution is much shorter for a 4  m@xmath42 star than for a solar - mass object .",
    "the ionization of the pn associated with oh354.88 - 0.54 appears to arise through shock interactions between the agb star s fast wind and previously ejected cold nebular material .",
    "our discovery of patches of nonthermal radio emission in this pn suggests a kinship with colliding - wind wr binaries but , in oh354.88 - 0.54 , the two winds were produced by a single central star .",
    "the locations of the shocked , nonthermally emitting , regions do not suggest a spherical interaction zone between the winds , nor do they align with any geometrically meaningful direction in the pn itself .",
    "however , the nonthermal regions each show the same projected distance from the central star in the plane of the sky , and there is the possibility that faint radio emission links the two regions .",
    "these characteristics suggest that the anisotropic fast wind collides with the continuous inner spherical surface of the slow wind .",
    "therefore , this pn offers a rare opportunity to recognize the nonspherical geometry of the fast wind , close to the time of its onset .",
    "the australia telescope is funded by the commonwealth of australia for operation as a national facility managed by the csiro .",
    "the most is owned and operated by the university of sydney , with support from the australian research council and science foundation within the school of physics .",
    "mc thanks nasa for supporting this work under its long term space astrophysics and astrophysics data analysis programmes , through grants nag5 - 7936 and nng04gd43 g with uc berkeley .",
    "the aao has undertaken the shs on behalf of the astronomical community .",
