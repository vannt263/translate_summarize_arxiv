    "to explain the origin of mass for the @xmath1 and @xmath2 bosons in the standard model ( sm ) the higgs mechanism predicts a breaking of electroweak symmetry .",
    "a consequence of this symmetry breaking is a heavy scalar boson whose mass is not predicted by the sm .",
    "direct searches for the higgs boson were performed at the lep experiments in the process @xmath3 with a centre of mass energy of 206.6 gev .",
    "a direct mass limit at @xmath4 @xmath5 114.4 gev is set at the 95% confidence level @xcite(all limits in this paper will be shown at 95% cl ) .",
    "this limit is slightly below the maximum available kinematic limit due to a small excess observed in the lep data .",
    "indirect limits have been placed on the higgs boson at the lep , sld and tevatron experiments from electroweak precision measurements @xcite .",
    "the sm fit best value for the mass of the higgs boson is @xmath4 = 76@xmath6 gev @xcite .",
    "the upper limit achieved from this fit is @xmath7 144 gev . when the direct mass limit is taken into account this limit",
    "is increased to @xmath8 182 gev ( figure [ fig - bbplot ] ) .",
    ", title=\"fig : \" ] , title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "the fit for the higgs mass shown in figure [ fig - bbplot ] shows that a light higgs boson is favoured which is accessible to the tevatron experiments .",
    "the tevatron accelerator collides @xmath9 with a centre of mass energy = 1.96 tev at an instantaneous luminosity up to around 3@xmath1010@xmath11 @xmath12s@xmath13 . at the time of writing ,",
    "the d  experiment has collected nearly 5 fb@xmath13 of data and results shown here include between 1 - 3 fb@xmath13 of data analysed .",
    "the dominant production mechanism for a sm higgs boson at the tevatron is via gluon - gluon fusion .",
    "an order of magnitude lower is associated production with a @xmath14 boson . at high masses",
    "the main search channel is gluon - gluon fusion with the higgs boson decaying to two @xmath1 bosons which subsequently decay leptonically .",
    "however , at low higgs masses ( @xmath8 135 gev ) the higgs decays into @xmath15 pairs which are extremely difficult to resolve against the large multijet background at a hadron collider . as such associated production",
    "is searched for where events are tagged by the leptonic decay of the @xmath14 boson .",
    "one of the most sensitive channels at low mass consists of a final state of two @xmath16 jets from the higgs boson and a charged lepton @xmath17 and a neutrino from the w. all three leptonic decays of the w are analysed at d  , however , the most sensitive are the decays to electrons and muons . they will be focused on here using 1.7 fb@xmath13 of data .",
    "events are selected with one or two @xmath16 tagged jets with transverse momentum @xmath18 20 gev , an isolated electron / muon with @xmath18 15 gev and missing transverse energy @xmath19 20 gev .",
    "the main backgrounds after selection are @xmath20jets and @xmath21 production . to improve separation between the signal and the irreducible background a neural network ( nn )",
    "is trained taking a number of kinematic and topological variables as input .",
    "the output of this nn ( figure [ fig - nnout ] ) are used to set limits on higgs production .",
    "the analysis sets a limit on @xmath22 = 10.9x@xmath23 at @xmath24 gev @xcite ( where @xmath23 is the cross section predicted for this process by the standard model ) .      at high mass @xmath26",
    "is searched for in the leptonic final state @xmath27 .",
    "this analysis uses approximately 3 fb@xmath13 of data and searches in three independent final states ( @xmath28 ) . to select these events two",
    "high-@xmath29 leptons are required and @xmath19 25 gev to account for the neutrinos .",
    "the main feature of this final state to differentiate from di - boson production is the small angle between the leptons arising from spin - correlations between them due to the spin-0 nature of the higgs boson .",
    "this is in contrast to the back - to - back nature of the leptons from diboson processes .",
    "a neural network classifier is also used here to improve the discrimination between signal and background and the output ( figure [ fig - nnout ] ) is used to set limits on higgs production .",
    "the analysis sets a limit on @xmath30 = 1.7x@xmath23 at @xmath31 gev @xcite .",
    "many other channels have been studied in the search for the sm higgs boson with some more sensitive than others . however , to obtain the best limit on higgs production at d  a combined limit is set .",
    "systematic uncertainties are taken into account using both modified frequentist and bayesian approaches to ensure the result to does not depend upon the details of the statistical method applied .",
    "the results across the full mass range for the d  combination are shown in figure [ fig - limits ] .",
    "to further improve the limits on a sm higgs boson a combination is performed with the cdf experiment ( currently only for high mass ) .",
    "the most interesting feature of this combination is that the observed limit crosses one at @xmath32 170 gev ( figure [ fig - limits ] ) , resulting in an exclusion of that higgs boson mass at the 95% cl @xcite ."
