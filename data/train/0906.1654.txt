    "inspection of the galaxy distribution in redshift surveys ( e.g.  in the sloan digital sky survey , york et al .",
    "2000 ) or of the distribution of dark matter particles in numerical simulations ( e.g. millennium simulations , springel et al .",
    "2005 ) reveals a striking ` cosmic web ' ( bond et al .",
    "1996 ) , composed of clusters , filaments , sheets and voids as primary building blocks . in the matter or galaxy",
    "distributions , one can clearly see large volumes of ` empty ' regions ( voids ) which are surrounded by thin denser sheetlike structures ( sheets ) .",
    "at even higher density contrast a network of filaments dominates the matter or galaxy distributions .",
    "finally , the massive clumps at the intersections of filaments typically correspond to rich galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "the human eye is readily capable of identifying these morphological features of the cosmic large - scale structure , but for quantitative analysis objective techniques for structure analysis are needed .",
    "the most commonly employed statistical measure for the distribution of matter and galaxies are low - order clustering statistics ( e.g. , the two - point correlation function and its fourier transform , the power spectrum ; peebles 1980 ) .",
    "apart from these standard statistical tools , one may also use other statistics , for example based on higher - order correlation functions , or measures for the abundance of halos as a function of mass or of voids of different sizes , to characterize cosmic structure .",
    "since halos and voids are approximately spherically symmetric structures and relatively easy to model , several very successful methods to extract these structures from simulations and observations have been developed . in n - body simulations ,",
    "halos are most commonly found as groups of particles by the friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm with a linking length set equal to some fraction ( @xmath1 ) of the mean particle separation ( e.g. davis et al .",
    "halos detected in this way show a mean enclosed density of about @xmath2 times the average mass density of the universe .",
    "observationally , galaxy groups can also be identified using the fof method , but with two linking lengths in order to take redshift distortions into account ( e.g. , eke et al .",
    "one may also use models for the density profile and velocity dispersion of dark matter halos to help extracting galaxy groups ( e.g. , yang et al . 2005 ) .",
    "there are numerous successful void finders , many of them have been compared in detail in a recent study by colberg et al .",
    "( 2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "compared to clusters and voids , filaments and sheets are more complicated geometric structures .",
    "both of them are genuine 3-dimensional objects associated with a distinct orientation in space .",
    "their density contrast is often quite close to the mean cosmic density , making their identification difficult and sometimes ambiguous .",
    "we also note that from a dynamical point of view there exists a sequence of transformations that can cast one of these structures into another , which blurs any clear distinction between these different morphological structures .",
    "matter tends to flow out of the voids , accretes onto the sheets , collapses to the filaments , and finally accumulates onto the large clumps at the intersection of the filaments .",
    "these processes are expected to impact the properties of the halos and the galaxies formed therein , leading to correlation between halo properties and large - scale environment . in a recent study , using high - resolution n - body simulations , gao et al .",
    "( 2005 ) found that the halo clustering strength not only depends on the masses of the halos but also on their formation times ( see also sheth & tormen 2004 ; wang et al .",
    "2007 ; dalal et al . 2008 ; hahn et al . 2009 ) .",
    "in addition to the age , other halo properties such as concentration and spin have also been found to correlate with the local environment ( avila - reese et al .",
    "2005 ; wechsler et al . 2005 ; bett et al . 2007 ; gao & white 2007 ;",
    "macci et al .",
    "2007 ) .    based on semi - analytical galaxy evolution models , croton et al .",
    "( 2007 ) showed that besides the properties of the host halo the large scale environment has to be taken into account to fully characterize the galaxies at halo centers ( see also reed et al .",
    "observations indicate a similar dependence of galaxy properties on environment . using a large galaxy redshift catalog , yang et al .",
    "( 2006 ) showed that groups ( of similar masses ) with red central galaxies are more strongly clustered than those with blue central galaxies ( see also wang et al .",
    "2008 ) . using the same data set , wang et al .",
    "( 2009b ) detected numerous red dwarf galaxies which were isolated , i.e.  which were not belonging to any neighboring larger association or group of galaxies .",
    "the origin of those red isolated dwarfs still remains unknown ( see also cooper et al . 2007 ) . to shed some more light on the impact of large - scale structure on halo / galaxy properties we here adopt the following strategy .",
    "we first identify and classify the large - scale environment , then we determine whether a given halo resides in a filament or sheet , and finally we try to find correlations between the halo spin and shape orientations and their large - scale environment .    up to the present day , a number of different approaches have been suggested to find filaments ( and/or sheets ) in simulations as well as in observations . among these methods",
    "two different classes of techniques can be distinguished : the first uses discrete distributions of objects ( e.g. , galaxies ) and the second is based on continuous density fields . in the following , we briefly summarize the basic ideas of these two approaches ( see also aragn - calvo et al . 2007a ; and references therein ) .    a discrete point set allows the use of a minimum spanning tree technique to link the points ( barrow et al .",
    "1985 ; colberg 2007 ) .",
    "however , cosmic structures identified by this method often show web - like features and it is difficult to define sizes and directions of the extracted filaments . finding filaments joining neighboring clusters has also been carried out .",
    "pimbblet ( 2005 ) searched the 2df galaxy redshift survey catalog for filamentary structures using the orientations of inter - cluster galaxies . a related approach based on the inter - cluster dark matter distribution derived from n - body simulations",
    "is discussed in colberg et al .",
    "more mathematically , stoica et al .",
    "( 2005 ; 2007 ) used a so called _ candy model _ to locate the filaments in galaxy surveys .",
    "all these approaches have the advantage that they directly deal with the original point sources and do not require the creation of continuous density fields .",
    "however , in general these techniques incorporate a large number of free parameters and the specific assignment of these parameters is , to a certain degree , arbitrary .",
    "the second type of techniques usually require the creation of a continuous density field .",
    "these approaches include the full characterization of the topology of the matter distribution in terms of minkowski functionals ( mecke et al .",
    "1994 ; schmalzing et al .",
    "1999 ) , the genus of the density field ( gott et al . 1986 ; hoyle & vogeley 2002 ) and the shape - finder statistics in three ( sahni , sathyaprakash & shandarin 1998 ) and two dimensions ( pandey & bharadwaj 2008 ) . a more rigorous classification of filaments and other structural elements is obtained with the skeleton analysis of density fields by novikov et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and sousbie et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , where the maxima and saddle points in the density field are specified using the hessian matrix ( i.e. the second partial derivative ) of the density field .",
    "recently , hahn et al . ( 2007a ; b ) have quantified the cosmic web using the hessian matrix of the potential field where according to the number of positive eigenvalues a region was classified as belonging either to a cluster , filament , sheet or void .",
    "the only free parameter in this analysis is the smoothing length of the density field . in a similar spirit , aragn - calvo et al .",
    "( 2007a ; b ) computed the hessian matrix based on the density field constructed with a delaunay triangulation field estimator ( schaap & van de weygaert 2000 ) .",
    "the methods in this second category are mathematically more rigorous than the techniques based on discrete point sets . only a few ( or even no ) free parameters are needed , and all halos ( galaxies ) can be classified since essentially every volume element and hence the objects within it can be classified .",
    "however , a disadvantage lies in the necessity for constructing a density ( potential ) field , and in the difficulties in assigning points , halos , or galaxies , to the appropriate volume element .    in this study , we compare two types of filament finding algorithms , one using the overall matter distribution and one just the halos obtained from a high - resolution cosmological n - body simulation .",
    "method slowromancap1@ employs the hessian matrix of the mass density field , where halos are differentiated into four types using a combination of criteria from hahn et al .",
    "( 2007a ) and aragn - calvo et al .",
    "( 2007a ) .",
    "method slowromancap2@ uses the halo distribution directly .",
    "our development of this approach has been inspired by the candy model approach suggested by stoica et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and the connecting cluster technique described in colberg et al .",
    "based on either method we extract filaments and sheets from our high resolution n - body simulation .",
    "we then correlate the characteristics of the cosmic structures , like sizes and orientations , with the spins and orientations of dark matter halos .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec_data ] ,",
    "we give a brief description of our n - body simulation and the halo catalog we used .",
    "we present a detailed description of the filament - finding methods based on either the dark matter density field or the distribution of dark matter halos , in section [ sec_method ] . in section  [ sec_results ] , we analyze various alignment signal measurements for halos with respect to the filaments ( and sheets ) .",
    "finally , we summarize our results in section  [ sec_summ ] .",
    "in this study , we make use of a n - body simulation carried out at the shanghai supercomputer center using the massively parallel gadget2 code ( springel et al . 2001 ; 2005 ) .",
    "the simulation evolved @xmath3 dark matter particles in a periodic box of @xmath4 on a side from redshift @xmath5 to the present epoch .",
    "the particle mass and softening length are @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "the cosmological parameters used in the simulation are @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , and @xmath13 . in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] , we show the distribution of dark matter particles in a slice of thickness @xmath14 at redshift @xmath15 . for clarity ,",
    "only 0.15% of the dark matter particles are plotted .",
    "this representation clearly shows the well - known features of the non - linear cosmic density field , in particular the prominent filamentary structures that coined the term ` cosmic web ' are nicely seen .",
    "dark matter haloes were identified from the simulation at redshift @xmath15 using the standard friends - of - friends ( fof ) algorithm ( davis et al .",
    "1985 ) with a linking length of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation .",
    "haloes obtained with this linking length have a mean over - density of @xmath16 ( porciani , dekel & hoffman 2002 ) . as an illustration ,",
    "we show in the upper - right , lower - left and lower - right panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : simulation ] the halo distributions for a sequence of decreasing lower mass limits : @xmath17 , @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as indicated in the panels .",
    "the sizes of the dots are scaled to be proportional to the virial radius of the dark matter halos .",
    "these plots indicate that the distribution of halos with masses @xmath20 can only resolve the high density regions at the nodes of the cosmic web , while halos with masses @xmath21 trace the filamentary structures quite well . including smaller halos down to @xmath19 can reveal subtle features even in void - like regions . as discussed in yang et al .",
    "( 2009 ; fig .",
    "1 ) , the sdss observations can completely resolve the dark matter halos with a mass limit of @xmath20 at redshift @xmath22 , and of @xmath23 at redshift @xmath24 .",
    "thus the halo - based probe for filamentary structures investigated in this paper can be reliably applied to the sdss observations at low redshifts .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to probe the orientations and spins of dark matter halos with respect to the filaments and sheets within the cosmic web .",
    "however , a reliable measurement of these halo properties , in particular of the spin , requires high mass resolution .",
    "therefore we only retain halos with at least @xmath25 particles for further analysis , resulting in a catalog with @xmath26 halos .",
    "the angular momentum @xmath27 of a fof halo containing @xmath28 particles is @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the particle s mass , @xmath31 is the position vector of the @xmath32-th particle relative to the center of mass , and @xmath33 is its velocity relative to the bulk velocity of the halo .    in order to determine the shape of a fof halo , we use the moment of inertia tensor ) represents the second moment of the mass tensor .",
    "the correct definition of the moment - of - inertia tensor deviates from this expression ( see e.g. , eq .  1 in hahn et al .",
    "however , in the context of cosmological alignment studies it has become a convention to call the second moment of mass tensor inertia tensor . ]",
    "@xmath34 with @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the component @xmath37 of the position vector of particle @xmath32 with respect to the center of mass .",
    "the axis ratios @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 @xmath41 are proportional to the square roots of the corresponding eigenvalues , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 , and the orientation of the halo is determined by the corresponding eigenvectors .",
    "in this section , we investigate two distinct methods to find the filaments in the simulation : one using the mass density field and the other using the distribution of dark matter halos .",
    "the first method we examine , hereafter referred to as method slowromancap1@ , is based on the local hessian matrix @xmath45 of the smoothed mass density field , defined as @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the smoothed density field . @xmath37 and @xmath48 denote the hessian matrix indices with values of 1 , 2 or 3 .",
    "thus , at the location @xmath49 of each halo we can quantify the local `` shape '' of the density field by calculating the eigenvalues of the hessian matrix ( e.g. , aragn - calvo et al .",
    "the number of positive eigenvalues of @xmath50 can be used to classify the possible environments in which a halo can reside into four regions , according to :    * @xmath51 : a region with no positive eigenvalue ; * @xmath52 : a region with one positive and two negative eigenvalues ; * @xmath53 : a region with two positive and one negative eigenvalues ; * @xmath54 : a region with three positive eigenvalues .    the direction of a filament can be identified with the eigenvector corresponding to the single positive eigenvalue of the hessian matrix in a filament region .",
    "we note that this method has only one free parameter , namely the smoothing scale @xmath55 of the gaussian filter employed in constructing the density field .",
    "different from the multi - scale morphology filter ( mmf ) method discussed in aragn - calvo et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , we follow hahn et al .",
    "( 2007a ) and adopt a fixed smoothing length of @xmath56 .",
    "hahn et al . ( 2007a ) pointed out that the relative volume fractions of the four categories depend on the choice of @xmath55 .",
    "for @xmath56 ( corresponding to halo masses of @xmath57 ) they find a good agreement between their orbit - stability criterion and a visual classification of the large - scale structure .",
    ", which is derived from the matter density distribution via poisson s equation , @xmath58 where the poisson s equation is solved using a fast fourier transform on @xmath3 grid cells . as a consequence of that , their eigenvalues have opposite signs compared to those based on the corresponding density field that we use here . ]    in order to compute the hessian matrix @xmath50 , we first construct a continuous density field from the discrete distribution of particles in the n - body simulation , using the cloud - in - cell ( cic ) technique with a @xmath3 grid .",
    "then the smoothed density field @xmath59 is produced by smoothing the cic generated density field @xmath60 with a spherically symmetric gaussian filter @xmath61 , @xmath62 where @xmath49 corresponds to the location of a given halo and the gaussian filter with smoothing scale , @xmath55 , is given by @xmath63 from equations ( [ hessianmatrix ] ) , ( [ smoothdensity ] ) and ( [ gassianfilter ] ) , we find @xmath64 \\nonumber\\\\ & & \\rho_{\\rm cic}(\\boldsymbol{y } ) g_{r_s}(\\boldsymbol{y},\\boldsymbol{x}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the kronecker delta ( aragn - calvo et al .",
    "finally , the eigenspace structure of the symmetric hessian matrix can be computed at the center of mass of each halo .    according to the number of positive eigenvalues at the locations of the dark matter halos we classify them into four categories , as outlined above .",
    "the numbers of halos in cluster , sheet , filament and void regions are , respectively , @xmath66 , @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , corresponding to @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73 per cent of the total number of halos . in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fila1 ] , we show the distribution of halos in a slice of thickness @xmath14 , indicating the classification according to their environments with different colors . in addition , the directions of the filaments are marked with arrows for those halos associated with them .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fila1 ] shows the environmental classification of @xmath74 grid point put down regularly in the mid - plane of the slice . according to visual inspection , the general appearance of the filamentary structures identified with this method is remarkably good .",
    "as shown in the previous section , filamentary structures can be well identified using the hessian matrix of the density field . however , this approach relies on an accurate knowledge of the matter density field , which is in many cases highly non - trivial to obtain .",
    "in particular , for observational data one may wish to use the distribution of galaxies , groups or halos directly to identify the filaments of the cosmic web .",
    "for this purpose , we now present a halo - based method for filament finding which is based on a slightly modified version of the ` candy model ' proposed by stoica et al .",
    "the candy model reconstructs filaments by connecting individual segments that are found in a basic point distribution ( galaxies , halos , etc . ) . in this study , we only aim to compare halo shape orientations with the orientations of the segments they are residing in , thus we do not discuss in detail the problem of composing individual segments into long connected filaments .",
    "hereafter , the segment extraction method derived from the candy model will be referred to as method slowromancap2@. in brief , there are two fundamental differences between method slowromancap1@ and slowromancap2@. one is the use of a biased tracer of the density field in method slowromancap2@. the other is that halos in method slowromancap2@ are automatically grouped into given filaments .",
    "that is , we know what halo belongs to what filament .    the requirements which a group of points has to fulfill to be considered a candidate segment have to be adjusted to the problem in question .",
    "here we focus on dark matter halos as building blocks for the filamentary structure of the cosmic web .",
    "therefore , a candidate segment is assumed to be a cylinder , with a length in the range of @xmath75 $ ] and a radius in the range @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "the mean mass density within the segment should be at least @xmath77 times that of the average mass density of all halos , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the total mass of the halos with more than @xmath25 particles and @xmath80 is the volume of the simulation .",
    "finally , a segment should have at least @xmath81 member halos .",
    "we set these free parameters as follows : @xmath82 note that the values chosen for these parameters are somewhat arbitrary , but the results are robust to substantial changes in these parameters .",
    "in particular , we tested a number of different reasonable sets of parameter values , all of them led to general agreement between the results . specifically , we found that changing any of the above listed parameters ( except for @xmath77 ) by 50% will only result in a less than 5% change in the number of halos identified as belonging to filaments .",
    "if @xmath77 is varied to @xmath83 or @xmath84 , about 59% or 31% of the halos , respectively , are classified as belonging to filaments .",
    "even for these two cases , the final results do not change qualitatively , however .    in the following",
    "we describe the successive steps of the segment extraction method .",
    "* step 1 . * the dark matter halos are ranked according to their masses .",
    "* step 2 . *",
    "starting from the most massive halo to ever smaller ones , we search around each halo @xmath32 ( node ) all other halos @xmath85 with distance in the range [ @xmath86 .",
    "these halo pairs form candidates for our filament segments .",
    "* step 3 . *",
    "we calculate for each candidate segment the filament strength ( average mass density ) , @xmath87 , which is defined as @xmath88 here , @xmath89 is the length of the candidate segment ( distance between the two halos @xmath32 and @xmath85 ) , @xmath28 is the total number of halos within the cylinder around this segment with radius @xmath55 , and @xmath90 is the mass of halo @xmath91 .",
    "the candidate segment radius , in the range @xmath92 $ ] , is determined such that @xmath93 reaches its maximum .",
    "* step 4 . * for all the candidate segments , we rank their strengths @xmath94 .",
    "the one with the largest strength , with at least @xmath81 member halos and @xmath95 , is defined as the first candidate segment associated with node halo  @xmath32 .",
    "* we rank all the member halos within that segment according to their masses , except the node halo @xmath32 .",
    "the most massive one @xmath96 with at least @xmath97 halos residing between halos @xmath32 and @xmath96 is defined as the second , terminal node of the segment .",
    "we remove those member halos that are between the two node halos ( belonging to segment @xmath98 ) from the halo list .",
    "thus member halos can only belong to one segment , while node halos can belong to more than one segment .",
    "the direction of the segment ( filament ) is defined to be the connecting line between the two node halos",
    ".    * step 6 .",
    "* once the segment @xmath99 is determined , we return to step 1 and search for other segments associated with node halo @xmath32 until no further segments can be found for this node halo . as an illustration",
    ", we show in fig .  [",
    "fig : test ] the halo distribution in a @xmath100 cube centered on the most massive halo @xmath101 , together with the node and member halos in segment @xmath99 which are marked with colored dots .",
    "the first four segments associated with node halo @xmath32 ( 6 in total ) are illustrated using colored dots in the four panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : test ] .    * step 7 .",
    "* we turn to the next node halo to search for its associated segments .",
    "we iteratively search the halo catalog until no further segments can be found .",
    "applying the segment extraction method to our halo catalog we find that 45% of all halos are classified as members of segments , and 2% as node halos .",
    "these two populations are substantially smaller than those obtained with method slowromancap1@ , where we found 63% and 19% to be classified as filament and cluster halos , respectively .",
    "note , however , in a recent paper forero - romero et al .",
    "( 2008 ) introduced an additional threshold @xmath102 for the classification of environment instead of just using the number of positive ( negative ) eigenvalues . increasing this barrier from @xmath103 to some finite value",
    "greatly reduces the volume ( mass ) occupied by the identified filaments , and in particular , reduces the number of ambiguous detections of feeble or spurious filaments .",
    "the discrepancy may hence just be a result of the higher detection threshold of method slowromancap2@ compared with method slowromancap1@. as a more quantitative comparison , in fig .",
    "[ mass_function ] , we show the mass functions of filament halos derived with method slowromancap1@ ( red dashed ) and method slowromancap2@ ( green dotted ) .",
    "the mass functions obtained from the two methods are very similar , especially at the high - mass end . while at the low mass end , because of the higher detection threshold of method slowromancap2@ , less halos are specified as belonging to the filaments . for reference",
    ", we also show the total mass function from our simulation ( blue dash - dotted ) , which is in good argeement with the analytic model prediction by sheth et al .",

    "[ fig : fila1 ] shows the distribution of halos within the filaments obtained with method slowromancap2@ in a slice of thickness @xmath14 .",
    "compared to the filaments detected by the hessian matrix approach in the left panel , only strong filaments are extracted by this method , while less prominent structures are not identified . yet , the advantage of this method is that it does not require knowledge of the density field .",
    "this is a significant advantage especially in the context of observations , where density reconstruction is often difficult .",
    "to quantify the impact of filaments and sheets onto halos , we investigate two types of alignment signals : one based on a halo s spin and the other on its orientation .",

    "we find that the halo spins tend to lie parallel to the filaments .",
    "the results are robust against the filament detection method .",
    "it has been argued that the angular momentum of halos originates from the tidal field exerted by the surrounding dark matter distribution ( peebles 1969 ; doroshkevich 1970 ; white 1984 ) .",
    "the spin directions are expected to be preferentially aligned with the planes of the sheets and the directions of the filaments ( e.g. , lee 2004 ) , although hydrodynamical simulations have also suggested that the spin axis may aline with the intermediate axis at turnaround ( navarro et al .",
    "2004 ) .    in order to characterize the strength of the alignment between angular momenta and filaments we calculate their average cosine , @xmath117 .",

    "[ spin_filament ] .",
    "although the alignment signals for the two methods are slightly different , the overall strength of the alignment detected with methods slowromancap1@ and slowromancap2@ agrees well .",

    "the most right hand panels of this figure clearly demonstrate that a _ strong _ alignment between the major axes and the directions of the filaments produces an anti - alignment between the spin axes and the filaments .",
    "this result is in agreement with simple geometric considerations .",
    "note however , theoretically a _",
    "strong _ anti - alignment between the major axes and the directions of the filaments , as addressed in the left hand panels of fig .",
    "[ spin - shape ] , _ does not _ guarantee an alignment between the spin axes and the filaments .",
    "in the case of @xmath130 and perfect alignment between minor axis and spin , the angle between the spin ( minor ) axis and the filament direction can assume any value within @xmath131 .",
    "the very strong alignment signals apparent in the most left hand panels must be induced purely by the influence of the filaments .",
    "combining the signals from the four panels , one would obtain the alignment signals shown in fig .",
    "[ spin_filament ] . on the other hand , note the range of the @xmath128 in each panel , the average @xmath128 for all halos in the four panels is larger than @xmath132 , again indicating an alignment between the major axis and filament directions ( as shown in fig .",
    "[ major_filament ] ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the two sets of alignments are indeed not contradictory , and that the large - scale environment , i.e.  the filaments and the sheets , can impact both the orientation and the spin of halos while allowing still for an internal correlation of these quantities within halos .      throughout the paper",
    "we find very good agreement between various alignment signals for methods slowromancap1@ and slowromancap2@ , however it is not necessory that the same halos in the two methods have the same filament directions . in order to make a more profound understanding of the agreement results of the two methods ,",
    "we compute the probability distribution @xmath133 of the angle between the directions of the filaments from method slowromancap1@ and the filament vectors from method slowromancap2@. as shown in fig .",
    "[ fila1-fila2 ] , the filament directions for the same halos in the two methods agree very well and more than 60% halos have @xmath134 . in addition",
    ", we did not find any significant halo mass dependence for these filament angles .",
    "as we have also checked the local density and distance to the most massive node halo of each common halo , we do not find any significant dependence on this angle @xmath105 .",
    "using the dark matter and halo distributions from a high resolution n - body simulation , we have identified the filamentary structures in the cosmic web using two different filament - finding algorithms .",
    "the first method is based on the hessian matrix of the density field ( method slowromancap1@ ) , where the halos are classified into four categories according to the signs of the three eigenvalues of the hessian matrix : clusters , filaments , sheets and voids .",
    "the advantage of this method is that the large - scale environments of the halos can be characterized unambiguously , and that there is only one free parameter in the analysis .",
    "however , this method needs detailed information about the local density field , which is difficult but not impossible to obtain based on observations .",
    "indeed , some recent studies are devoted to density field reconstructions based on galaxy and halo distributions ( e.g. erdogdu et al .",
    "2006 from 2mass redshift survey ; and wang et al .",
    "2009a from halo distribution in simulations ) .",
    "on the other hand , method slowromancap2@ directly uses the distribution of halos .",
    "thus it eliminates the need for a reconstruction of the local mass density field , at the price of a larger number of tunable parameters .",
    "filamentary structures are here traced by connecting single segments which are identified according to their relative mass over - density . in this study",
    "we were not interested in explicitly reconstructing long coherent filaments , rather we only explore the orientations of the segments relative to the halos orientations associated with them .",
    "the main shortcomings of method slowromancap2@ are the relatively large number of parameters and a lack of sensitivity for the detection of less prominent filaments . nevertheless , method slowromancap2@ is easy to implement on top of observational data , including also galaxy group catalogs such as that of yang et al .",
    "this makes it a highly useful approach in practice , provided its results are consistent with those obtained with method slowromancap1@. this is indeed the case , as we have demonstrated in this study .",
    "moreover in method slowromancap2@ , halos are automatically grouped into filaments , and we know what halo belongs to what filament .",
    "based on the classification of the large - scale environment around halos that we obtained , we examined the spin - filament and the shape - filament alignments , as well as the corresponding quantities for halos and sheets .",
    "overall , we find a tendency for halo spins and shapes to be oriented parallel to filaments and perpendicular to the normal vector of sheet like structures .",
    "this trend becomes obvious and is clearly significant when compared to results from isotropic ( randomized ) orientations .",
    "both the spin and shape alignment strengths are stronger for halos close to more massive node ( cluster ) halos , and at smaller separations to the node halos . yet , the spin and shape alignment strengths show an opposite mass dependence : smaller halos display stronger ( weaker ) spin ( shape ) alignments with the filaments .    for the halos in different environments , we have also investigated their intrinsic spin - shape alignment .",
    "we found that the spin axes are preferentially aligned with the minor axes of halos , and are perpendicular to the major axes , independent of the halo environments . at first glance , this result seems to be at odds with our finding that _ both _ the spin and major axes tend to align with the filament directions . however , there is not really a contradiction here , because the alignments _ are not perfect _ in both cases .",
    "in fact , the distributions of the alignment angles are sufficiently broad that both of these seemingly contradictory alignment signals can coexist .",
    "our results are in good agreement with recent n - body studies where different filament finding methods have been employed .",
    "hahn et al .  ( 2007b ) applied a hessian matrix approach to the gravitational potential field ( instead of the density field ) , and also found an opposite mass dependence for the alignment strengths of spin- and shape - filament alignments .",
    "moreover , they found that the spin axes of halos with mass @xmath121 are preferentially perpendicular to the filament directions , which we can not confirm in this study because of the limited volume of our simulation .",
    "a similar behavior has been detected by aragn - calvo et al .",
    "( 2007b ) using a multi - scale morphology filter method for the classification of the large - scale environments .    quite interestingly",
    ", we find in method slowromancap2@ according to the spin and shape alignment signals of the halos in the filaments , there is a transit influence scale of large scale environments : from the 2-d collapse phase of the filament to the 3-d collapse phase of the cluster / node halo at small separation to the most massive node halo .",
    "the general trends found from our n - body simulation reveal a substantial interplay between the large - scale environments and the internal properties of the dark matter halos",
    ". it would be interesting to see whether similar trends can be observed in real galaxy samples ( e.g. , lee & pen 2001 ; lee & erdogdu 2007 ) .",
