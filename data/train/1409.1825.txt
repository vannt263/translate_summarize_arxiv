    "throughout the last decade the number of experimental reports of the anomalous diffusive phenomena has grown .",
    "for example , some of these concern moisture dispersion in building materials ( see for ex .",
    "@xcite ) but also some other minerals like zeolite @xcite . when we consider an essentially one dimensional ( other dimensions can be neglected ) porous medium with one boundary kept at constant moisture , the concentration in subsequent time instant @xmath0 and space point @xmath1 is a function of @xmath2 .",
    "this characteristic space - time scaling is not , however , present in every type of porous media . as experiments showed , in certain materials the moisture propagates according to the @xmath3 scaling , where @xmath4 .",
    "when @xmath5 the moisture concentration represents a subdiffusive character , meaning that the fluid particles can be trapped in some regions for a significant amount of time . in the superdiffusive case @xmath6",
    "there is a possibility that water can be transported for large distances in a relatively short time ( jump behavior ) .",
    "all of these features are certainly associated with the geometrical aspects of the medium such as pore distribution or heterogeneous features such as highly conductive channels and macropores @xcite .",
    "some authors state that the anomalous behavior can also be caused by chemical reactions that casue the diffusivity to change during the imbibition @xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts to model the anomalous diffusion in porous media such as building materials .",
    "for example in @xcite a model based on a nonlinear fickian law has been proposed .",
    "the most popular approach , however , was made by the use of the fractional derivatives @xcite .",
    "these generalizations of the classical derivative operator are necessary nonlocal .",
    "this gives an opportunity to model the history ( nonlocality in time ) or long - range influence in medium ( nonlocality in space ) .",
    "the theoretical foundation that the transport in porous media should include the nonlocal phenomena was developed in @xcite , where authors devised the nonlocal darcy s law from the boltzmann transport equation and argumented that the nonlocality can be a consequence of the heterogeneous pore distribution .",
    "the fractional derivative approach has an advantage to offer a theoretical framework in which all the anomalous behaviors can be governed by the derivative order .",
    "the disadvantage , however , is that the fractional equations are always more difficult to solve explicitly ( either analytically or numerically ) especially in the nonlinear case .    in this work",
    "we generalize our previous results concerning the time - fractional porous medium equation , which is used to model anomalous moisture dispersion .",
    "the initial results were published in @xcite and further developed in @xcite . in what follows",
    "we present a theoretical derivation of the time - fractional anomalous diffusion equation and provide an analysis of its approximate solutions .",
    "the boundary conditions , that we supplement , are of the two types : constant concentration or constant flux at the interface . both of these have a direct physical interpretation .",
    "we present our approximation method and show some estimates on the error terms .",
    "all of our theoretical considerations are illustrated by numerical analysis and fitting with real experimental data .",
    "both of these verify that our approximations are sensibly accurate when describing anomalous diffusion in porous media .",
    "moreover , a simple and closed form of the formulas we derive is an additional advantage which can quicken the data fitting process in applications .",
    "the usual way of data fitting is being done with a numerical solution of the nonlinear anomalous diffusion equation . due to the nonlocality of the fractional operator ,",
    "the computational power needed for the nonlinear finite difference method is very large .",
    "simple ( but approximate ) solutions that we find can be a remedy for these computational problems .",
    "consider a porous medium in which the darcy s law holds @xcite @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the flux of the fluid with viscosity @xmath9 flowing under the pressure @xmath10 through the medium of permeability @xmath11 . in any porous medium",
    "not all of its space can be filled with the flow .",
    "the _ concentration _",
    "@xmath12 is defined to be density of the water inside the representative elementary volume ( rev ) at position @xmath1 and time instant @xmath0 .",
    "the total fraction of space available for the fluid is called the _",
    "porosity _ of the medium . under suitable assumptions @xcite",
    "the pressure @xmath10 can be expressed as a monotone function of the concentration @xmath13 , so we can write @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the diffusivity , which can depend on the moisture concentration @xmath13 . in applications",
    "this is almost always the case @xcite - the diffusivity can change even a several orders of magnitude with the change of @xmath13 . in any region of the porous medium",
    "the amount of fluid must be conserved and thus the moisture must obey the continuity equation @xmath16 where subscript denotes the derivative with respect to time variable @xmath0 . above equation along with ( [ darcy ] )",
    "gives us the governing nonlinear diffusion equation known in the hydrology as the _ richards equation _",
    "@xcite @xmath17 if we included the gravity we would obtain an additional convective term .",
    "but in our model it is sufficient to consider only the diffusive phenomena . for our purposes",
    "it is also sufficient to reduce the equation to one spatial dimension since the diffusion in the experiment we want to model progresses mostly in one direction . in this work",
    "we will consider two different initial - boundary conditions for ( [ richards ] ) , namely @xmath18 which models a constant concentration at the face of an initially dry sample and @xmath19 which is a mathematical description of constant flux at the origin .",
    "as recent investigations show , equation ( [ richards ] ) is not sufficient to describe the moisture distribution in some porous media , in particular construction materials .",
    "namely , the characteristic space - time scaling of some processes is very different from the solution of the classical diffusion equation . by a quick calculation",
    "we can check that a solution of ( [ richards ] ) with conditions ( [ cond1 ] ) is a function of @xmath2 only . in this case ( [ richards ] ) reduces to an ordinary differential equation .",
    "the experiments from @xcite show that the solution of the equation , which is supposed to describe the ( anomalous ) diffusion , scales as @xmath3 for @xmath20 .    to model the anomalous behavior of the characteristic space - time scaling we use the fractional partial differential equation @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the caputo partial derivative operator defined on a suitably chosen function space by ( @xcite ) @xmath23 where @xmath24 + 1 $ ] is the first integer greater than @xmath25 .",
    "this equation describes the subdiffusive character of the porous medium . in that case",
    "the fluid particles can be trapped in some regions for a prolonged periods of time .",
    "this in consequence leads to the memory effect of the process . at some particular time , not only the fluid driven by the flow can cross the rev but also some of its portions that have just been freed from a longer wait periods .",
    "this prolonged waiting times can be consequences of many physical phenomena that can happen in the porous medium .",
    "it is important to make the following remark .",
    "it is a well known fact that with vanishing initial conditions , that is for @xmath26 $ ] , the caputo fractional derivative ( [ caputo ] ) coincides with the riemann - liouville version ( see @xcite and @xcite for the self - similar case ) defined by the formula @xmath27 where @xmath24 + 1 $ ] is the first integer greater than @xmath25 .",
    "this operator requires less regularity on the differentiated function and thus is more suited to be treated mathematically .",
    "the difference between the caputo and riemann - liouville fractional derivatives can be easily seen by defining the fractional integral @xcite @xmath28 then we have the representation @xmath29 and @xmath30 , that is they differ by the order of differentiation operator .",
    "it is also worth to mention the composition formula for the functions with vanishing initial conditions @xmath31 .",
    "\\label{compo}\\ ] ] with some subtleties , the fractional derivative operators enjoy many other identities that are similar to the integer order derivatives . for a thorough and deep analysis of many topics concerning these matters",
    "see @xcite .",
    "the initial values of @xmath13 in ( [ cond1])-([cond2 ] ) are zero for our case @xmath5 .",
    "therefore in our analysis we will consider the following equation for the time - fractional nonlinear diffusion equation @xmath32 we choose the particular form of the diffusivity @xmath15 to be proportional to the some power of the concentration , that is @xmath33 .",
    "this is a well - known choice which accurately describes many different porous media . in @xcite authors inverted ( [ erl ] ) and",
    "derived a formula for diffusivity .",
    "after calculations they obtained a profile similar to our power - type choice of diffusivity function . to simplify the final form of the investigated equation we introduce the proper scales @xmath34 in the case of ( [ cond1 ] ) and @xmath35 for ( [ cond2 ] ) .",
    "then , the equation describing the time - fractional nonlinear diffusion takes the form @xmath36 where we dropped the asterisks for the clarity of presentation .",
    "the initial - boundary conditions are now @xmath37 or @xmath38 equation ( [ erl2 ] ) can be called the time - fractional porous medium equation . for the mathematical analysis of its space - fractional version the reader",
    "is referred to @xcite .      equation ( [ e ] ) modeling subdiffusion , is almost always derived by stochastic analysis in a continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) framework @xcite .",
    "it is instructive to see how this equation can be devised deterministically without any assumptions on the probability distributions of waiting times .",
    "once again consider a fluid in the porous medium which flow is governed by the continuity equation ( [ conti ] ) .",
    "assume that due to certain physical phenomena fluid particles can be trapped in some regions for a period of time @xmath39 .",
    "due to this trapping , only a portion of the instantaneous flux at time @xmath0 should be taken into account when calculating the change of concentration .",
    "the rest consists of the particles that have just been released . in that case",
    "the continuity equation can be written as a delayed equation with weights some @xmath40 and @xmath41 @xmath42 at instant @xmath0 only a fraction of the flux comes through the rev , the rest if trapped for @xmath39 .",
    "if such trapping can happen for a several periods @xmath43 we then have @xmath44 by introducing the weight density @xmath45 it is straightforward to generalize trapping phenomena to a continuous distribution of periods . by definition",
    "we have @xmath46 , where @xmath47 and thus @xmath48 by a change of the variable we arrive at a non - local integro - differential equation in which any past value of the flux is taken into account @xmath49 this accounts for the fluid particles that can be trapped for any period of time . the amount of flux of the particles that wait for the time @xmath39 is equal to @xmath50 . in the sequel we will determine the form of the ( generalized ) function @xmath51 . to this end we make the following claims .    1 .",
    "( _ generalization _ ) in the case of the classical diffusion , that is without the waiting times , ( [ nonlocal ] ) should reduce to ( [ conti ] ) .",
    "( _ simplicity _ ) the form of @xmath51 should be as simple as possible .    because we assume that the resulting equation should possess a self - similar solutions dependent on @xmath25 , let us denote this explicitly by writing @xmath52 instead of @xmath51 . by the first claim we should have @xmath53 ,",
    "when ( say ) @xmath54 .",
    "here @xmath55 is the dirac delta distribution .",
    "the limit should be understood in the appropriate weak sense in the distribution topology .",
    "it is easy to see that when @xmath56 we immediately retrieve the classical local equation ( [ conti ] ) . as @xmath54 the particles",
    "are being trapped for shorter and shorter instants eliminating the non - local memory effect . since @xmath52 should be treated as a distribution we will make a slight change of the kernel in ( [ nonlocal ] ) in order to treat only ordinary functions .",
    "the simplest approximation of the @xmath55 distribution is the following @xmath57},}{h},\\ ] ] where the limit is understood in the weak sense , that is @xmath58 the above equation is just the elementary formula for differentiating an integral as a function of the upper limit of integration .",
    "this motivates us to rewrite the equation ( [ nonlocal ] ) as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is now a _ function _ with @xmath61 .",
    "the limit of @xmath55 distribution is now hidden under the derivative operator .",
    "it is easy to make a sensible educated guess on the form of @xmath60 : by the simplicity claim we suppose that it should be a power function @xmath62 , where the constant @xmath63 has to be determined .",
    "we see that if we choose @xmath64 we will get @xmath65 where we identified the riemann - liouville fractional derivative of order @xmath66 .",
    "different choice of @xmath63 would yield a constant multiple of the fractional derivative and would not modify the quantitative features of the equation .",
    "thus our choice of @xmath63 is the simplest .",
    "now , by the composition identity ( [ compo ] ) we can operate with @xmath67 on both sides of ( [ nonlocal3 ] ) and get @xmath68 which is the same as ( [ e ] ) with flux from the darcy s law ( [ darcy ] ) .",
    "this concludes the derivation .",
    "we see that the emergence of the fractional derivative is very natural provided that the fluid particles can be trapped in some regions in space for a period of time with a power - type weight .",

    "the strategy is to approximate the erdlyi - kober fractional integral ( [ ek ] ) by a derivative operator and then to tackle the resulting ordinary differential equation , which resembles the one considered in the classical case .",
    "since the classical theory for a porous medium equation is now mostly developed we retranslate our problem into the similar one which lies on the firm ground .",

    "we are aiming to obtain only an approximate solution of the equation ( [ maineq ] ) since it can not be integrated ( even numerically ) in a straightforward way .",
    "this is due to the fact that we do not know @xmath82 , which defines the free - boundary in ( [ conds1])-([conds2 ] ) .",
    "this difficulty can be circumvented by a particular transformation introduced in @xcite ( but see also @xcite ) during an investigation of a similar equation describing the classical porous medium equation ( @xmath96 ) .",
    "it turns out that when we substitute @xmath196 the free boundary problem can be transformed into an initial - value one .",
    "we make the final ( higher - order ) simplification and make the substitution ( [ subs2 ] ) .",
    "we immediately obtain @xmath197 hence the equation ( [ maineqa ] ) can be transformed into @xmath198 where the initial condition @xmath199 was determined from the requirement that @xmath200 .",
    "it is also interesting that the condition @xmath201 is _ necessary _ : it emerges from the structure of the equation ( [ maineqaa ] ) by setting @xmath202 .",
    "it is worthy to stress the fact that the problem ( [ maineqaa ] ) is the _ same _ for both sets of conditions ( [ conds1])-([conds2 ] ) .",
    "the difference between those two cases will emerge when we calculate the wetting front position @xmath203 .    assuming the taylor expansion @xmath204 equation ( [ maineqaa ] )",
    "can be solved by a comparison of terms .",
    "equivalently , but more computationally convenient , is to take the @xmath205th derivative of the both sides of ( [ maineqaa ] ) and use the leibniz rule for derivative of the product .",

    "it is straightforward to calculate as much coefficients @xmath207 as necessary , for example @xmath211    the taylor series expansion ( [ taylor ] ) is often useful for @xmath191 of order of unity . for larger values we can apply the perturbation theory .",
    "assuming that the solution @xmath156 of the equation ( [ maineqaa ] ) can be expressed in the form @xmath212 we obtain the following equations for @xmath213 and @xmath214 @xmath215 immediately we obtain @xmath216 and therefore @xmath217.\\ ] ]    the substitution ( [ sub ] ) gives also a very convenient way of determining the wetting front position @xmath82 .",
    "here we must distinguish between the cases ( [ conds1 ] ) and ( [ conds2 ] ) .",
    "for the former we have @xmath218 and thus @xmath219 for the case of ( [ conds2 ] ) we @xmath220 , hence @xmath221 since in order to calculate @xmath82 we only need to know the values of @xmath156 and @xmath222 at @xmath106 , the series representation ( [ taylor ] ) can give very accurate approximations . when @xmath191 is large the perturbation approximation ( [ pert ] ) yields better results .",
    "we note also that the formulas for the wetting front position @xmath82 ( [ eta1])-([eta2 ] ) are the only differences between two kinds of boundary conditions .",
    "the self - similar solution @xmath97 behaves in the same way for both of these setting .",
    "the difference appears only in the scaling and choice of @xmath70 and @xmath71 in ( [ scale ] ) .",
    "we can now go back to the substitution ( [ subs2 ] ) and write @xmath223 where @xmath224 can be calculated from the recurrence ( [ recurr ] ) and @xmath82 is obtained for each of the boundary conditions ( [ conds1])-([conds2 ] ) from ( [ eta1])-([eta2 ] ) respectively . although complicated , these formulas are readily computable in any scientific environment .",
    "it is also worth to mention the form of the derivative at @xmath225 @xmath226 combining the above formula along with the value of @xmath97 taken from ( [ conds1 ] ) or ( [ conds2 ] ) we obtain an initial - value problem for @xmath97 .",
    "that is , along with ( [ u0 ] ) we have @xmath227 the numerical solution of this problem is much simpler than the one with the unknown free boundary @xmath82 . by truncating the series ( [ taylor ] ) we obtain the following approximations @xmath228 where by the subscript we denoted how many terms to take in ( [ taylor ] ) and ( [ eta1])-([eta2 ] ) .",
    "these approximations can be used to determine the closed form of the _ cumulative moisture _ @xmath229 where @xmath70 and @xmath71 are chosen with respect to the considered boundary conditions ( [ conds1])-([conds2 ] ) . by the use of ( [ ui ] )",
    "we have @xmath230 and in general @xmath231 here @xmath232 denotes the hypergeometric function ( see @xcite ) .    to illustrate the accuracy of our approximations we implement the finite difference numerical scheme proposed in @xcite to solve the time - fractional porous medium equation ( [ erl2 ] ) with conditions ( [ cond4 ] ) ( the case of ( [ cond3 ] )",

    "to model this phenomenon they used equation ( [ erl ] ) but instead of solving it , they approximated the diffusion coefficient @xmath243 .",
    "moreover , they indicated that the moisture transport process in the porous medium is very dependent on the history .",
    "hence , the idea of the model with time - fractional derivative of order @xmath25 which is a nonlocal - in - time operator .",

    "the subdiffusive character of the medium is evident and the accuracy of our approximation is decent .     from ( [ ui ] ) to the self - similar moisture profile of the porous zeolite obtained from @xcite .",

    "we have analyzed the so - called time - fractional porous medium equation , which is a mathematical description of the anomalous transport in some types of media ( such as building materials ) .",
    "we have shown that the emergence of the temporal fractional derivative is a natural consequence of the trapping phenomena inside the medium , which lead to the subdiffusion .",
    "our deterministic derivation is dual to the one done in the stochastic ctrw framework and thus shows a deep relation between these two approaches . in our setting , the nonlinear flux can be easily incorporated yielding the time - fractional richards equation . due to serious complexity of the resulting equation",
