    "the determination of variations in the transverse beam position and in the beam energy using readings of beam position monitors ( bpms ) is one of the standard and important problems of accelerator physics .",
    "if the optical model of the beam line and bpm resolutions are known , the typical choice is to let jitter parameters be a solution of the weighted linear least squares problem .",
    "even so for the case of transversely uncoupled motion this least squares problem can be solved  by hand \" , the direct usage of obtained analytical solution as a tool for designing of a",
    " good measurement system \" does not look to be fairly straightforward .",
    "it seems that a better understanding of the nature of the problem is still desirable .",
    "a step in this direction was made in the paper @xcite , where dynamic was introduced into this problem which in the beginning seemed to be static .",
    "when one changes the position of the reconstruction point , the estimate of the jitter parameters propagates along the beam line exactly as a particle trajectory and it becomes possible ( for every fixed jitter values ) to consider a virtual beam consisting from virtual particles obtained as a result of application of least squares reconstruction procedure to `` all possible values '' of bpm reading errors .",
    "the dynamics of the centroid of this beam coincides with the dynamics of the true difference orbit and the covariance matrix of the jitter reconstruction errors can be treated as the matrix of the second central moments of this virtual beam distribution .    in accelerator physics",
    "a beam is characterized by its emittances , energy spread , dispersions , betatron functions and etc .",
    "all these values immediately become the properties of our bpm measurement system . from",
    "now one can compare two bpm systems comparing their error emittances and error energy spreads , or , for a given measurement system , one can achieve needed balance between coordinate and momentum reconstruction errors by matching the error betatron functions in the point of interest to the desired values .",
    "this dynamical point of view on the bpm measurement system was explored in @xcite in application to the case of transversely uncoupled nondispersive beam motion and in this paper we continue this study adding energy degree of freedom .",
    "the paper by itself is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we introduce all needed notations , formulate the problem and give its standard least squares solution . as a new element",
    ", we formulate the necessary and sufficient conditions for the bpm system to be able to distinguish between transverse and energy jitters in terms of its three bpm subsystems . in section 3 ( the core section of this paper )",
    "we make parametrization of the covariance matrix of the jitter reconstruction errors using the usual accelerator physics concepts of emittance , energy spread , dispersion and betatron functions .",
    "we also show that the error dispersion is not simply one of the many dispersions which could propagate through our beam line .",
    "it , in analogy with the error betatron functions @xcite , is by itself solution of some minimization problem and is uniquely determined by transport matrices between bpm locations and by bpm resolutions . in section 4",
    "we consider the measurement system which utilizes three beam position monitors ( the minimum number of bpms needed ) and analyze in details effect of symmetries of the optics between bpm locations . in section 5",
    "we continue the investigation of periodic measurement systems started in @xcite .",
    "this time with the main accent on achievable energy resolution . and ,",
    "finally , in section 6 we discuss application of the courant - snyder quadratic form as error estimator , even so in the case when energy degree of freedom is taken into account this quadratic form is not bound to be an invariant .",
    "let us consider a magnetostatic beam line which is built from optical elements which are symmetric about the horizontal midplane @xmath0 .",
    "in such magnetic system the transverse particle motion is uncoupled in linear approximation , the vertical oscillations are dispersion free and errors in reconstruction of their parameters were already studied in @xcite , and in this paper we will examine together @xmath1-plane and energy degrees of freedom because they are connected through ( linear ) dispersion .",
    "we will use the variables @xmath2 for the description of the horizontal dispersive beam motion . here , as usual , @xmath3 is the horizontal particle coordinate , @xmath4 is the horizontal canonical momentum scaled with the kinetic momentum of the reference particle and the variable @xmath5 stays for the relative energy ( or momentum ) deviation . which we have in mind can be found in @xcite , but let us note that for the present study the particular form of this variable is unimportant .",
    "let us also note that while in @xcite the symbol @xmath5 was used for the bpm reading errors , in this paper we prefer to use it for the relative energy deviation , and for the bpm reading errors we will introduce @xmath6 as new notation .",
    "] as orbit parameters we will understand values of @xmath7 and @xmath5 given in some predefined point in the beam line ( reconstruction point with longitudinal position @xmath8 ) and as transverse and energy jitter in this point we will mean the difference    @xmath9    between parameters of the instantaneous orbit and parameters of some predetermined reference ( golden ) trajectory @xmath10 .",
    "let us assume that we have @xmath11 bpms in our beam line placed at positions @xmath12 and they deliver readings    @xmath13    for the current trajectory with previously recorded observations for the golden orbit being    @xmath14    suppose that the difference between these readings can be represented in the form    @xmath15    where the random vector @xmath16 has zero mean and positive definite covariance matrix @xmath17 , i.e. that    @xmath18    the purpose of this paper is to study the influence of bpm reading errors @xmath19 on precision of reconstruction of jitter parameters under assumption that optical model of the beam line is known .",
    "the additional assumptions which we will make are : the covariance matrix @xmath17 stays constant and the bpm reading errors can be treated as independent from one measurement to the other .",
    "so bpm errors that are correlated from measurement to measurement ( calibration and other systematic errors , drifting bpm readings and etc . ) and fluctuations in bpm resolutions will be not considered . in practical applications",
    "these assumptions may or may not be realistic , but , first , they make the underlying mathematics almost trivial . ] and , second , their satisfaction is , in some sense , one of the goals for the bpm and bpm electronics designers .",
    "let @xmath20 be a transfer matrix from location of the reconstruction point to the @xmath21-th bpm location    @xmath22    and let us assume that the cholesky factorization @xmath23 of the covariance matrix @xmath17 is known . as usual",
    ", we will find an estimate    @xmath24    for the difference orbit parameters ( [ int_1 ] ) in the presence of bpm reading errors by solving the following weighted linear least squares problem    @xmath25    here @xmath26 denotes the euclidean vector norm , @xmath27 and    @xmath28    the problem ( [ sec1_9 ] ) always has at least one solution and , if we will assume that the matrix @xmath29 has full column rank @xmath30 , then the solution of this problem is unique and is given by the well known formula    @xmath31    @xmath32    the calculation of the covariance matrix of the errors of this estimate ( object of our main interest ) is also standard and gives the following result    @xmath33    let us discuss in more details the important condition for the matrix @xmath29 to have full column rank .",
    "this condition will allow us to separate betatron and dispersion oscillations at the bpm locations and , therefore , will make our system applicable for measuring transverse and energy jitter .    because the matrix @xmath34 is nondegenerated",
    ", the rank of the matrix @xmath29 is always equal to the rank of the matrix @xmath35 , and the matrix @xmath35 , in the next turn , will have full column rank if and only if the gram determinant @xmath36 of its column vectors    @xmath37    is not equal to zero .    to find desired expression for the gram determinant let us introduce @xmath38 - transport matrix from the location of the bpm with index @xmath21 to the location of the bpm with index @xmath39    @xmath40    with these notations and using binet - cauchy formula one can obtain after some straightforward manipulations    @xmath41    @xmath42    where @xmath43 ( in the framework of the usual 6 by 6 matrix formalism for the linear beam dynamics ) is the coefficient that connects variation of the particle path length with variation of the particle transverse momentum and which can be expressed using elements of the matrix @xmath44 as follows    @xmath45    from ( [ binc_3 ] ) one sees , that the matrix @xmath46 will have the full column rank if and only if there are at least three beam position monitors with indices @xmath47 and @xmath48 such that the transport matrices between them satisfy the condition    @xmath49    or ( equivalently ) the condition    @xmath50    note that both conditions , ( [ binc_3_0 ] ) and ( [ binc_3_1 ] ) , involve elements of two transfer matrices , but while ( [ binc_3_0 ] ) uses matrices between neighboring bpms ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , condition ( [ binc_3_1 ] ) operates with the transport matrices from first to two remaining bpms ( @xmath51 and @xmath53 ) . in simple words the condition ( [ binc_3_1 ] ) , for example , means that one can not vary particle transverse momentum and particle energy at the first bpm location in such a fashion that these variations are invisible at the two downstream bpms .",
    "let @xmath54 be a matrix which transport particle coordinates from the point with the longitudinal position @xmath55 to the point with the longitudinal position @xmath56",
    "@xmath57    similar to @xcite , one can easily show that for any given value of @xmath19 the estimate of the difference orbit parameters @xmath58 propagates along the beam line exactly as particle trajectory    @xmath59    as one changes the position of the reconstruction point .",
    "so again we can consider a virtual beam consisting from virtual particles obtained as a result of application of formula ( [ sec1_15 ] ) to `` all possible values '' of the error vector @xmath60 .",
    "the dynamics of the centroid of this beam @xmath61 coincides with the dynamics of the true difference orbit    @xmath62    and the error covariance matrix ( [ sec1_16 ] ) can be treated as the matrix of the second central moments of this virtual beam distribution and satisfies the usual transport equation    @xmath63    consequently , for the description of the propagation of the reconstruction errors along the beam line , one can use the accelerator physics notations and represent the error covariance matrix in the familiar form    @xmath64    @xmath65    as usual for the particle dynamics , this parametrization has two invariants ( quantities which are independent from the position of the reconstruction point ) , namely transverse error emittance @xmath66 and rms error energy spread @xmath67 , which can be calculated according to the formulas    @xmath68    where we have used the notations    @xmath69    and @xmath70 is the gram determinant of the vectors @xmath71 .",
    "the error twiss parameters , of course , remain the same as they were earlier published in @xcite , namely    @xmath72    and for the new objects , the coordinate and momentum error dispersions , we have    @xmath73    @xmath74    as it was shown in @xcite , the error twiss parameters ( [ twcvm_3 ] ) are not simply one of many betatron functions which could propagate through our beam line , they are by themselves solutions of some minimization problem and are uniquely determined by transport matrices between bpm locations and by bpm resolutions . and we would like to show , that the same is true also for the error dispersions ( [ twcvm_4 ] ) and ( [ twcvm_5 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath75 and @xmath76 be some dispersions specified in the reconstruction point .",
    "then the corresponding coordinate dispersion at the @xmath21-th bpm location can be calculated as follows    @xmath77    consider a vector    @xmath78    and a minimization problem    @xmath79    by standard means it is not difficult to show that if @xmath80 then the solution of this minimization problem is unique and is given by the formulas ( [ twcvm_4 ] ) and ( [ twcvm_5 ] ) .    if , additionally , @xmath81 then the minimum in ( [ d3 ] ) is bigger than zero ( and is equal to zero otherwise ) and the following identity holds    @xmath82    note that geometrically the vector @xmath83 is nothing else as taken with an opposite sign projection of the vector @xmath84 onto a linear subspace formed by vectors @xmath85 and @xmath86 and hence the vector @xmath87 is orthogonal to both , vector @xmath85 and vector @xmath86 .",
    "to finish this section let us , for the case when readings of different bpms are uncorrelated , i.e. when the covariance matrix @xmath17 is a positive diagonal matrix    @xmath88    write down the following useful expressions for the gram determinants    @xmath89    @xmath90    which enter formulas ( [ twcvm_2 ] ) for the transverse error emittance and for the rms error energy spread .",
    "let us assume that we have three beam position monitors in our beam line which deliver uncorrelated readings with rms resolutions @xmath91 , @xmath92 and @xmath93 , and let @xmath94 and @xmath95 be transfer matrices between first and second , and between second and third bpm locations respectively    @xmath96    when the phase advance between the first and the second bpms or the phase advance between the second and the third bpms is not multiple of @xmath97 , i.e. when    @xmath98    this system can be used for the measurement of the transverse orbit jitter with the transverse error emittance given by the following expression    @xmath99    in order to be able to resolve both , transverse and energy , jitters simultaneously we have to assume , additionally to ( [ sec_threebpm_001 ] ) , that    @xmath100    where the @xmath101 and @xmath102 coefficients can be expressed using elements of the matrix @xmath94 as follows    @xmath103    with ( [ sec_threebpm_001 ] ) and ( [ sec_threebpm_0021 ] ) satisfied , we obtain for the square of the rms error energy spread    @xmath104    to complete description of the covariance matrix of the reconstruction errors ( [ twcvm_1 ] ) for the three bpm case , we also need formulas for the error coordinate and momentum dispersions , and for the error betatron functions . and although it is not very difficult to provide some formulas using ( [ twcvm_3 ] ) , ( [ twcvm_4 ] ) and ( [ twcvm_5 ] ) , the results are not very informative and it is not easy to derive some nontrivial conclusions from them .",
    "so in this section we will give more digestible expressions for error dispersions and error betatron functions making an additional simplifying assumption about our measurement system that the transfer matrix @xmath95 between the second and the third bpm is not an arbitrary beam transport matrix , but is obtained as a result of some symmetry manipulation with the transfer matrix between the first and the second bpm .",
    "let a magnet system between the second and the third bpms be a mirror symmetric image of the magnet structure between the first and the second bpm locations .",
    "then    @xmath105    the transverse error emittance of this measurement system is given by    @xmath106    and the error betatron functions at the bpm locations can be calculated as follows    @xmath107    @xmath108    @xmath109    @xmath110    @xmath111    @xmath112    if we will assume that bpm resolutions follow mirror symmetry of the system , which means that @xmath113 is equal to @xmath114 , then , as it could be expected , the error twiss parameters will satisfy the following symmetry relations    @xmath115    for the square of the error energy spread we have the following expression    @xmath116    and the coordinate and momentum error dispersions at the bpm locations are given below    @xmath117    @xmath118    @xmath119    @xmath120    @xmath121    @xmath122    one sees that if bpm resolutions will follow mirror symmetry of the system , they , similar to the error betatron functions , will satisfy    @xmath123    independently if @xmath124 is equal to zero or not .",
    "applied in the symmetry point is the necessary and sufficient condition for the total transfer matrix of the mirror symmetric system to be achromatic .",
    "] one also sees that if mirror symmetric system can be used for energy jitter measurement ( i.e. if @xmath125 ) , then the error dispersion is nonzero at the system entrance and exit , again independently if @xmath124 is equal to zero or not .    as a more specific example , let us consider three bpms integrated into four bend magnetic chicane , as shown by red circles in figure 1 . for this system    @xmath126",
    "where    @xmath127    and    @xmath128    therefore this system always can be used for the transverse and energy jitter measurement , and , as a concrete case , let us consider the first bunch compressor of the flash facility @xcite , which is the four bend chicane of the discussed layout .",
    "the typical deflection angle for this chicane is about @xmath129 and the distances @xmath130 and @xmath131 are equal each other and are equal to @xmath132 ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "let us assume that the first and the third bpms ( orbit bpms ) have the same rms resolutions @xmath133 and for the second bpm ( energy bpm ) let us introduce the notation @xmath134 .",
    "let @xmath135 will be energy jitter resolution desired for the system . with these numbers and notations , and using the usual three sigma criterion @xmath136 we obtain from ( [ sec_threebpm_1_0 ] ) the following inequality    @xmath137    which gives us limitations on the range of the bpm resolutions which can provide the required precision for the energy jitter measurement .",
    "figure 2 , for example , shows the area of acceptable bpm resolutions defined by the inequality ( [ chicane_4 ] ) for @xmath138 .",
    "to finish the chicane discussion , let us move the first and the third bpms into positions shown as green circles in figure 1 .",
    "for this case    @xmath139    @xmath140    @xmath141    @xmath142    and one sees that this bpm positioning still can be used for the jitter measurement , because @xmath143 and @xmath144 , but both , the transverse error emittance and the error energy spread become larger ( for the same bpm resolutions ) than for the original bpm layout . nevertheless , it is a good example of a mirror symmetric system for which @xmath145 and the total transfer matrix is not achromatic .",
    "if a magnet system between the second and the third bpms is a mirror antisymmetric image of the first part of the system , then    @xmath146    the transverse error emittance and the error beta functions remain the same as for the mirror symmetric case , but the measurement of the energy jitter is not possible anymore , independent of the bpm resolutions following symmetry of the system or not .",
    "the coordinate error dispersion is always zero at the bpm locations with the momentum error dispersion taking the values    @xmath147    which are independent from bpm resolutions .",

    "let us assume that our measurement system is periodic , by which we mean that @xmath149 .",
    "we named it in the title as two periodic owing the fact that two equal transfer matrices are involved , but , more correctly , it should be treated as a three cell system because we consider three bpms .",
    "note that general periodic measurement systems constructed from @xmath11 identical cells will be studied in details in the next section , but with additional simplifying assumptions that the cell transfer matrix allows periodic beam transport and that all bpms have the same resolutions .",
    "the transverse error emittance of the two periodic system can be expressed in the form    @xmath150    where    @xmath151    and calculation of the error betatron functions gives the following results    @xmath152    @xmath153    @xmath154    @xmath155    @xmath156    @xmath157    let us assume in the following that bpm resolutions follow symmetry of the system , which , in the periodic case , naturally mean that @xmath158 .",
    "in this situation @xmath159 and @xmath160 are always equal to each other and , it seems , it is the only symmetry which does not require additional assumptions about coefficients of the cell transport matrix @xmath161 .",

    "the error betatron functions will be two cell periodic ( will stay unchanged after transport through the whole system ) , if and only if    @xmath166    which , when compared with ( [ tps_010_1 ] ) , gives equation    @xmath167    as the condition for the `` true two cell periodicity '' ( two cell periodic , but not one cell periodic ) .",
    "this condition means that the transverse part of the total system matrix @xmath168 ( two by two submatrix located in the left upper corner ) is equal to the minus identity matrix for which arbitrary incoming beta and alpha functions will be transported without changes through the system , but the error betatron functions will also bring the sum of the beta function at the bpm locations to the minimal possible value .",
    "to finish the discussion about error betatron functions let us note , that if in the matrix @xmath161 the first two diagonal coefficients are to equal each other ( @xmath169 ) , then    @xmath170    and one may say that in this situation the error betatron function becomes mirror symmetric .    for the error energy spread and the error coordinate and momentum dispersions we have in the case of the two periodic measurement system the following formulas    @xmath171    @xmath172    @xmath173 @xmath174    @xmath175    @xmath176 @xmath177    @xmath178    @xmath179 @xmath180    and , if resolutions of all three bpms will be equal , the error dispersion will satisfy the equality    @xmath181    the condition for the error dispersion to be cell periodic is more restrictive than for the error betatron functions , namely    @xmath182    and the condition for the `` true two cell periodicity '' is    @xmath183    which does not lead to any noticeable symmetry of the error betatron functions and which means that the transverse part of the cell matrix @xmath94 is equal to the sum of the minus identity matrix plus some nilpotent matrix @xmath184 ( @xmath185 ) .    note that under condition ( [ tps_02_8 ] ) we have for the periodic cell phase advance the following relations    @xmath186      if a magnet system between the second and the third bpms repeats the magnet system between the first and the second bpms but with switched directions of dipole magnets , then    @xmath187    in analogy with transition from mirror symmetric to mirror antisymmetric case , the transverse error emittance and the error betatron functions remain the same as for the two periodic measurement system , but , in contrast to mirror antisymmetric case , this system still can be used for the energy jitter measurement if    @xmath188    which , in particular , forbids the magnet system between the first and the second bpms to be mirror symmetric by itself .    for this measurement system",

    "when we consider the jitter problem , the subject of our real interest is the actual difference @xmath61 between parameters of the instantaneous and the golden trajectory .",
    "our measurement system delivers us an estimate @xmath58 of this parameter , which includes the effect of the bpm reading errors @xmath60 .",
    "thus , in the framework of the model considered , the only information which we could obtain about the true difference @xmath61 is the statistical information based on the properties of the random variable @xmath254 , which , due to our assumptions , has zero mean and whose statistical distribution does not depend on the actual value of @xmath61 .",
    "it seems to be natural to use the module @xmath255 as a numerical measure of the difference between estimated and true beam energies , but the quantitative measure of the difference @xmath256 from zero in the transverse phase space could be chosen differently .",
    "one may simply use the euclidean vector norm , but , as it was already stated in @xcite , the usage of the courant - snyder quadratic form has certain advantages .",
    "for example , when one considers errors only in the reconstruction of the transverse orbit parameters in the beam line without dispersion , the courant - snyder quadratic form is an invariant and therefore all estimates based on it do not depend on the position of the reconstruction point . and ,",
    "as one will see below , even for dispersive particle motion the courant - snyder quadratic form is a `` much better conserved quantity '' than the euclidean norm .",
    "let us first return to the situation whose study was already started in paper @xcite , where we considered errors in the reconstruction of transverse orbit parameters in the beam line without dispersion .                  where @xmath262 is the mismatch between the error and the design betatron functions .",
    "that is , probably , all what one can obtain without making additional assumptions about distribution of bpm reading errors .    in this subsection",
    "we will assume that the random vector @xmath19 has a multivariate normal distribution and will find not only higher order moments of the random variable @xmath263 , but also its probability density .            and the components of the vector @xmath266 are independent standard normal variables",
    ". the matrix @xmath267 is @xmath11 by @xmath11 matrix , but , as it was also shown in @xcite , it has only two nonzero eigenvalues , namely                moreover , it is not very complicated to calculate the probability density of this random variable using , for example , results published in @xcite .",
    "this density @xmath275 is equal to zero for negative values of its argument , and for @xmath276        note that for @xmath279 the density ( [ probd ] ) becomes the density of chi - square distribution with two degrees of freedom and in this case the distribution function @xmath280 can be calculated in the explicit form                  the first terms in the right hand sides of formulas ( [ tae_1 ] ) and ( [ tae_2 ] ) represent the pure betatron oscillations .",
    "let us at the beginning estimate their difference using the courant - snyder quadratic form , which in this case will be an invariant , i.e. let us consider the random variable                which is similar to ( [ sec_gd_2 ] ) and in which @xmath290 are again two independent standard normal variables .",
    "unfortunately , the expressions for @xmath291 become essentially more complicated than ( [ sec_wc_11 ] ) and , with the notations                        to finish this section , let us note that in order to get probabilistic characteristic of the random variable ( [ sec_gd_1 ] ) , i.e. in order to study not the difference in the pure betatron oscillations , but the total difference in the transverse motion , one simply has to set to zero the design dispersions in all formulas of this subsection ( independently , if actual design coordinate and momentum dispersions are equal to zero or not ) .",
    "the obtained formulas will , of course , not have invariant character anymore .",
    "nevertheless , the dependence form the position of the reconstruction point will enter them through the single parameter , namely through the value @xmath298 ."
