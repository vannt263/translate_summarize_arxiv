    "magnetically induced ferroelectricity provides a route to materials with a large magneto - electric ( me ) coupling .",
    "the appearance of the ferroelectric order simultaneously with the onset of a particular magnetic order suggests that the magnetic and electrical properties should be strongly interconnected .",
    "therefore , one might expect to observe a strong dependence of the electric polarization on external magnetic fields in such materials .",
    "indeed , a pronounced interplay between ferroelectricity and magnetism was observed experimentally @xcite in ( gd , tb , dy)mno@xmath3 , ( tb , dy)mn@xmath4o@xmath5 , ni@xmath3v@xmath4o@xmath6 , etc . in these materials ,",
    "ferroelectricity is induced by a specific ( e.g. , cycloidal ) magnetic ordering .",
    "since polarization is a polar vector quantity , it is necessary to break the inversion symmetry in order for the ferroelectric phase to appear . in magnetically induced ferroelectrics",
    ", the inversion symmetry can be broken by the magnetic order alone , or in some cases , by the magnetic order in combination with the crystal structure ( e.g. , in ca@xmath3comno@xmath7  @xcite ) , where separately both the lattice and magnetic structures have inversion symmetry . the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling is essential in order to allow the broken symmetry to be communicated from the magnetic to the charge and lattice degrees of freedom .    in our work ,",
    "we focus our attention on , in which the appearance of polarization is attributed to the cycloidal order of magnetic moments on the mn@xmath8 sites .",
    "is an orthorhombically distorted perovskite material whose lattice has _ pbnm _",
    "symmetry with 20 atoms per unit cell .",
    "the magnetic properties of  are mainly due to the mn@xmath8 ions .",
    "the competition between the nearest - neighbor and next - nearest - neighbor spin interactions leads to a rich phase diagram .",
    "experimentally it is known that below @xmath9  k the magnetic moments form a sinusoidally modulated antiferromagnetic order .",
    "below @xmath10  k , a phase transition occurs in which the magnetic order develops a cycloidal character ( with spins in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane ) with modulation wave - vector @xmath11 along @xmath0 , and a polarization simultaneously appears along @xmath1 .",
    "phenomenological and microscopic theoretical models  @xcite can explain how the cycloidal magnetic order can drive the system to become ferroelectric , and one can predict the direction of the polarization ( but not its sign ) on rather general symmetry grounds . however , it is unclear whether one should expect the ionic displacements ( phonons ) to play the most significant role in creating electric polarization , or whether a purely electronic mechanism could explain the observations .",
    "our previously - reported initial findings  @xcite and a related study  @xcite suggested that , at least in the case of the spin spiral lying in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , the lattice contribution to the polarization dominates over the electronic contribution in .",
    "however , these works left several questions unanswered .",
    "here , we first briefly review our earlier work , emphasizing a careful analysis of the lattice - mediated contribution to the polarization using first - principles calculations .",
    "we then discuss several extensions of the work , including a study of the dependence of the results on the choice of @xmath2 parameter , additional details concerning the site - specific spin - orbit interaction and its effects on the dynamical effective charges , and a more thorough and revealing investigation of the dependence of the polarization on the wave - vector of the spin spiral .",
    "the electronic - structure calculations are based on the density functional theory ( dft ) and are performed using the projector - augmented wave ( paw ) method  @xcite in a plane - wave basis set .",
    "the plane - wave energy cutoff is 500 ev .",
    "we use the vasp code package  @xcite for our calculations .",
    "we do not include @xmath12 electrons in the tb paw potential .",
    "the local - density approximation for the exchange - correlation functional is used ( ceperley - alder  @xcite with vosko - wilk - nusair correlation  @xcite ) . for a proper treatment of mn @xmath13 electrons , we use on - site coulomb corrections",
    "implemented in a rotationally - invariant lda+@xmath2 formulation  @xcite .",
    "we consider two values of @xmath2 , 1 and 4 ev .",
    "the results of a systematic study with @xmath14ev were reported previously in ref .",
    "@xcite ; some of these will be reproduced here for comparison .",
    "we consider the cycloidal magnetic order having a spin spiral lying in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane and wave - vector @xmath15 propagating in the @xmath0-direction ( see fig .  [ model ] ) .",
    "the experimental value of the wave vector is incommensurate with the lattice , @xmath16  @xcite .",
    "since we use periodic boundary conditions , we study commensurate cycloidal spin structures with wave - vectors @xmath17 and 1 using appropriate supercells .",
    "the structural relaxation was performed with @xmath18 ( 60 atoms per cell ) , which is close to the experimental @xmath15 ( fig .",
    "[ model ] ) . a 3@xmath191@xmath192 @xmath20-point sampling is used .",
    "the berry - phase approach  @xcite is used for the calculation of the electric polarization .",
    "a crystal structure optimization was performed for the 60-atom supercell using @xmath14ev and @xmath21ev .",
    "these calculations were carried out without so interaction to obtain centrosymmetric reference structures , with respect to which berry phase polarization will be calculated in the subsequent analysis .",
    "the lattice parameters and wyckoff coordinates of the relaxed structures are given in table  [ tab : str ] .",
    "for both values of @xmath2 , the calculated structural parameters are very close to the experimental ones , with the lattice vectors being in slightly better agreement with experiment for the case of @xmath21ev .",
    "the calculation of the polarization in the presence of the so interaction for these relaxed structures yields an estimate for the pure electronic contribution to the polarization .",
    "we find @xmath22 and @xmath23 for @xmath14ev and @xmath21ev respectively ( with the direction of polarization parallel to the @xmath1 axis , as was expected from symmetry ) .",
    "in both cases , the magnitude is much smaller than the observed value of @xmath24  @xcite , indicating that it can be neglected for any reasonable value of @xmath2 .",

    "here we compare the results obtained with different coulomb interaction parameters .",
    "the results in table  [ tab : wyck_modes ] for @xmath14ev and @xmath21ev may seem different , but in fact they are qualitatively similar . the forces may be viewed as vectors in an 8-dimensional space , and one can calculate the angle @xmath39 between them to find @xmath40 .",
    "thus , the direction of the forces is almost the same , although the magnitude is different .",
    "this means that the underlying physical mechanism of the magnetically induced polarization does not depend strongly on the choice of @xmath2 , while the magnitude of the effect does change with @xmath2 .    in the subsequent sections we will consider only @xmath14ev , which gives better agreement with the experimental polarization",
    "moreover , in this case the calculated band gap matches the experimental value of @xmath41ev  @xcite . in general , a better strategy for choosing the @xmath2 value would be to calculate the exchange parameters and fit those , rather than the band gap , to the experimental data . in the present case , however , such an approach leads to a similar choice  @xcite of parameters .      to better understand the role of the spin - orbit interaction",
    ", we studied how the behavior of the system changes depending on the strength of the so interaction and on the presence of so on various atomic sites .",
    "we performed calculations of the forces with the so interaction turned off on all sites other than tb , then mn , then o. using the force - constant matrix , we estimated the lattice contributions to the polarization and found them to be @xmath42c / m@xmath43 , @xmath44c / m@xmath43 and @xmath45c / m@xmath43 , respectively .",
    "this result shows that the so interaction on the mn sites is responsible for almost all of the lattice - mediated contribution to the polarization ( see the column for @xmath37 in the table  [ tab : wyck_modes ] ) .",
    "we also calculated the purely electronic contributions to the polarizations for these three cases .",
    "interestingly , the electronic contribution comes almost entirely from the spin - orbit effect on the tb sites .",
    "several calculations of the forces with modified so strength confirmed that they depend linearly on the so strength .",
    "microscopic theoretical models involving the displacements of ions  @xcite show that the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction can induce ferroelectric displacements of ions .",
    "usually , only the interaction between the nearest - neighbor transition metals is considered in such models . as a consequence",
    ", the polarization is expected to depend sinusoidally on the angle between the spins of the nearest - neighbor mn sites , @xmath46 @xcite , and thus sinusoidally on @xmath15 . to study the dependence of the lattice contribution to the electric polarization on @xmath47 , we have carried calculations of the so - induced forces for a 40-atom supercell ( @xmath15=@xmath48 ) and an 80-atom supercell ( @xmath15=@xmath49 ) .",
    "note also that the same 60-atom supercell can be used to set up a spiral with the wave - vector @xmath15=2/3 .",
    "in general , if the supercell consists of @xmath50 primitive cells , one can construct spirals with wave - vectors @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "we also used the primitive 20-atom cell for the calculations with @xmath29 and @xmath53 . in all these calculations we kept the same structural coordinates as for the 60-atom structure to make sure that we only change one parameter ( @xmath15 ) in this study .",
    "we calculated the forces , and again filtered those that were ir - active .",
    "we find that the pattern of the ir forces matches almost exactly that of the 60-atom cell , i.e. , the directions of the eight - dimensional vectors almost coincide in all cases . using the force - constant matrix calculated on the 60-atom supercell and the effective charges from table  [ tab : wyck_modes ] , we can estimate the polarization for the new wave - vectors . the result",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ ksplot ] .",
    "actual calculations were performed only for non - negative values of @xmath15 , as symmetry arguments show the that polarization must be an odd function of spin - spiral wave - vector .",
    "the values @xmath29 and @xmath53 correspond to a collinear spin arrangement , in which cases the polarization was zero as expected .",
    "one can see that the dependence of the polarization on @xmath15 deviates significantly from a simple sinusoidal form .",
    "surprisingly , the polarization is almost linear in @xmath15 up to @xmath54 ; such a linear dependence is expected in the long - wavelength limit , but that is a rather stretched assumption for @xmath15 up to 1/2 .",
    "this result indicates that nearest - neighbor dm models oversimplify the mechanism of the polarization induction , and that taking the next - nearest - neighbor interactions into account may be important .",
    "the experimental @xmath15 lies in the range where we can assume a linear dependence .",
    "the extrapolation to @xmath15=0.28 yields a value for the lattice contribution of the polarization of about @xmath55c / m@xmath43 .",
    "[ model ] also shows the dependence of the total energy per formula unit on the wave - vector .",
    "we remind the reader that in these calculations the structural parameters were kept fixed , with only the directions of the magnetic moments on mn sites being changed .",
    "however , one can still see that the wave - vector at which the minimum occurs is close to the experimental value of @xmath15 .    .",
    "the triangle indicates the extrapolation of the polarization to the experimental wave - vector of @xmath56 . ]",
    "we have analyzed the lattice contribution to the electric polarization in the cycloidal - spin compound , with the spin spiral lying in the @xmath0-@xmath1 plane , using density functional theory within the lda+@xmath2 framework .",
    "we compare the results for two values of @xmath2 ( 1 and 4 ev ) , and find that the mechanism of magnetoelectric coupling is quite independent of @xmath2 .",
    "the dependence of the polarization on the spin - spiral wave period is studied in detail .",
    "we find that it deviates significantly from the sinusoidal dependence expected from simple models .",
