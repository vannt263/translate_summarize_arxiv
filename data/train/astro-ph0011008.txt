    "hard x - ray observations are the most efficient way of tracing emission due to accretion mechanisms , such in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , and sensitive hard x - ray surveys are powerful tools to select large samples of agn less biased against absorption and extinction . in this framework",
    "we decided to take advantage of the large field of view and good sensitivity of the bepposax mecs instrument ( boella et al .",
    "1997a , b ) to survey tens to hundreds of square degrees at fluxes @xmath7 ( fiore et al .",
    "2000a ) , and using higher sensitivity xmm - newton and chandra observations to extend the survey down to @xmath8 on several deg@xmath2 .",
    "the results from the optical identification of a sample of faint chandra sources discovered over the first 0.14 deg@xmath2 have been published by fiore et al .",
    "( 2000b ) .",
    "this approach is complementary to deep pencil beam surveys ( @xmath9 deg@xmath2 , see e.g. mushotzky et al .",
    "2000 , hornschemeier et al .",
    "2000 ) , as we cover a different portion of the redshift  luminosity plane .",
    "our purpose is to study cosmic source populations at fluxes where the x - ray flux is high enough to provide x - ray spectral information in higher sensitivity follow - up observations .",
    "this would allow the determination of the distribution of absorbing columns in the sources making the hard xrb , providing strong constraints on agn synthesis models for the xrb ( e.g. comastri et al . 1995 ) .",
    "the high energy large area survey ( hellas , fiore et al . 1999 ,",
    "2000a , 2000c ) has been carried out in the 4.5 - 10 kev band because : a ) this is the band closest to the maximum of the xrb energy density which is reachable with the current imaging x - ray telescopes , and b ) the bepposax mecs point spread function ( psf ) greatly improves with energy , providing a 95% error radius of 1@xmath10 in the hard band ( fiore et al .",
    "2000a ) , thus allowing optical identification of the x - ray sources .",
    "about 80 deg@xmath2 of sky have been surveyed so far using 142 bepposax mecs fields at @xmath11 deg .",
    "147 sources have been found with @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "we find a density of 13 - 21 sources per square degree at @xmath0 @xmath13 , which contribute to @xmath3 % of the hard xrb in this energy range .    for the spectroscopical identifications we concentrated in a reduced subsample of 110 mecs fields having @xmath14 , and excluding the regions with @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "in this subsample the sky coverage is @xmath17 deg@xmath2 at @xmath18 @xmath13 , and 0.5 deg@xmath2 at @xmath19 @xmath13 .",
    "we found in total 115 such sources with @xmath12 @xmath20 .",
    "correlations of the hellas spectroscopic subsample of 115 sources with catalogs of cosmic sources provide 26 coincidences ( 7 radio - loud agn , 13 radio - quiet agn , 6 clusters of galaxies ) .",
    "optical spectroscopic follow - ups have been performed on 49 of the 89 remaining hellas error - boxes , providing 36 new identifications ( fiore et al .",
    "1999 , la franca et al .",
    "2000 in preparation ) .",
    "we limited the optical identification process to objects with surface density @xmath21 deg@xmath22 to keep the number of spurious identifications in the whole sample @xmath23 . as a consequence ,",
    "we chose a limit of r@xmath24 for broad line agn ; r@xmath25 for narrow line agn ( sy1.8 - 2 ) ; and r@xmath26 for emission line galaxies ( liners and starbursts ) . according to these limits we found 13 `` empty '' fields in total .",
    "the summary of the spectroscopic identifications is shown in table 1 .",
    ".the spectroscopic identifications [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     the correlation with existing catalogues did identify only 2 type 2 agn and emission line galaxies .",
    "this is explained as there are no existing large catalogues of such objects .",
    "consequently a bias is introduced in the observed fractions of the populations of the identified sources against type 2 agn and narrow emission line galaxies .",
    "however the flux distribution of the sample of the 26 sources identified through cross - correlations with catalogues is similar ( according to the ks tests ) to that of the total sample of 115 sources , and to the sample of 36 sources identified at the telescopes . in this case",
    "we can correct for the introduced biases . applying these corrections",
    "we derive a value of 52@xmath27 for the true fraction of type 1 agn in the total sample , and 29@xmath27 for narrow emission line galaxies and type 2 agn .",
    "the remaining 19@xmath27 are either agn with optical magnitudes fainter than our spectroscopic limits or clusters of galaxies , bl - lac etc . etc .",
    "these numbers do not correctly address the question on the estimate of the ratio of type 1 and 2 agn .",
    "our sample is also biased against high redshift type 2 agn which are indeed fainter than our spectroscopic optical limit of @xmath28=19 for narrow line agn ( sy1.8 - 2 ) , and r@xmath26 for emission line galaxies .",
    "for this reason all the spectroscopic identified type 2 agn have @xmath29 .",
    "a first preliminary estimate can be drawn by taking into account only the agn having @xmath4 . in this case",
    "we estimate that the ratio of the number of type 2 agn and emission line galaxies to the number of type 1 agn is 3@xmath30 , in agreement with the unified models for agn .",
    "more accurate analysis via model predictions from the evolution of type 1 and 2 agn are underway .",
    "in figure 2 we plot the softness ratio ( s - h)/(s+h ) as a function of the redshift for the 53 identified sources detected far from the beryllium strong - back supporting the mecs window .",
    "note that the softness ratios of constant column density models strongly increases with the redshift .",
    "most of the narrow line agn have ( s - h)/(s+h ) inconsistent with that expected from a power law model with @xmath31 .",
    "absorbing columns , of the order of @xmath32 cm@xmath22 , are most likely implied .",
    "note also that some of the broad line agn have ( s - h)/(s+h ) inconsistent with that expected for a @xmath34 power law , in particular at high redshift .",
    "the ( s - h)/(s+h ) of the 24 broad line agn is marginally anti - correlated with @xmath35 ( spearman rank correlation coefficient of -0.364 , corresponding to a probability of 92@xmath27 ) .",
    "the number of sources is not large enough to reach a definite conclusion .",
    "similar results have been recently found in asca samples by akiyama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) and della ceca et al .",
    "xmm - newton and chandra follow - up observations may easily confirm or disregard a significant absorbing column in these high @xmath35 broad line quasars .",
    "we combined our sample of hard x - ray selected agn with other samples of agn identified by grossan ( 1992 ) , boyle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , and akiyama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) . a total of 151 type 1 agn have been used in the redshift range @xmath36 .",
    "values of @xmath37 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 , q@xmath39 , @xmath40 have been used .",
    "the 2 - 10 kev luminosities have been computed using the k - correction derived from the model of the spectrum of type 1 agn as in pompilio , la franca and matt ( 2000 ) .",
    "the coverage of the @xmath41 plane by the whole sample of type 1 agn is shown in figure 3a .",
    "the sample of grossan ( 1992 ) consists of 84 type 1 agn and 12 type 2 agn , predominantly at low redshift ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the sample covers an area of 26919 deg@xmath2 down to a flux limit of @xmath43 . the sample of boyle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) consists of 12 agn1 and 6 agn2 .",
    "the sample of akiyama et al .",
    "( 2000 ) consists of 25 agn1 , 5 agn2 , 2 clusters , 1 star and 1 unidentified source .",
    "we carried out a maximum likelihood analysis to derive best - fit parameters which described the 2 - 10 kev luminosity function and its cosmological evolution . following boyle et al .",
    "( 1988 ) and ceballos and barcons ( 1996 ) , we chose a two - power - law representation for the qso lf :        a preliminary estimate of the fitted luminosity function is shown in figure 3b",
    ". the corresponding fitted values are @xmath49 , @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 .",
    "no redshift cut - off in the luminosity evolution has been applied .",
    "this result is in good agreement with the previous estimate from boyle et al .",
    "( 1998 ) on a smaller sample of 95 type 1 agn ( see figure 3b ) .",
    "the evolved luminosity function shows a density excess of low luminosity high redshift objects .",
    "a more detailed study of the luminosity function which will take into account a possible redshift cut - off and density evolution is underway .",
    "we thank the bepposax sdc , soc and occ teams for the successful operation of the satellite and preliminary data reduction and screening .",
