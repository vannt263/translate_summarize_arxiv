    "accord is integrated in the distributed control system such as gamos that consists of scada and various high level functions .    as numerical examples ,",
    "the industrial computations are presented .",
    "accord is an abbreviation for algorithmic and software complex of constructive nonlinear optimization with restriction on discrete - continuous network variables .",
    "it is intended for economic and operational steady state optimization of gas pipeline networks .",
    "there is no restriction on network topology in accord .",
    "the general objectives of optimization include the following :     to plan the installation of a network ;     to optimize the route plan of pipelines and location of equipment ;     to select pipe diameters ;     to specify facilities ;     to minimize the expenditure ;     to select supplies and demands ;     to optimize network operation , etc .",

    "minimal cost and maximal flow problems are generalized .",
    "the typical problem consists in the optimal choice of :     dependencies between flow and pressure from the given families ;     node intensities , i.e. values of supplies and demands ;     flow ;     pressure .",

    "section 6 contains conclusions .",
    "let us consider a set of models and functions which are widespread in gas transport , distribution and gas supply companies :    \\1 ) gas demand forecast for every client ;    \\2 ) definition of set of gas suppliers and corresponding purchase quantities ;    \\3 ) definition of gas injection and withdrawal quantities for every gas storage ;    \\4 ) optimization of contracts for gas sale and purchase , including both gas exchange with adjacent companies and injection or withdrawal for different gas storage ;    \\5 ) contract optimization with restrictions arising due to gas network ;    \\6 ) gas price investigation , calculation and definition for sale and purchase for long and short term planning ;    \\7 ) determination of sold and purchased gas quantities in order to prepare billing ;    \\8 ) settlement and confirmation of accounts for sold and purchased gas for every supplier and consumer and for every client station ;    \\9 ) scada functions both for sale and purchase and for gas network ( scada is abbreviation for supervision , control and data acquisition ) ;    \\10 ) supervision of actual contract fulfilment ;    \\11 ) optimization of gas network state ;    \\12 ) simulation and optimization of development of gas network .",
    "the above functions allow to conclude that the following models play a central role :    \\1 ) contract ;    \\2 ) contract partner : supplier , consumer , gas storage , etc . ;",
    "\\3 ) client station ;    \\4 ) gas network ;    \\5 ) flow network .    at present , these models have different development degrees .",
    "the network modelling went through several development steps .",
    "it derives its sources from kirchhoff .",
    "it follows the development periods of graph theory , flow networks , dynamic hydraulic simulation of networks , and network steady state optimization .",
    "it should be pointed out that models for network dynamic optimization are not developed yet so that they could be used industrially .",
    "there are various contract models .",
    "they have a common feature that they are not connected with a model of gas network .",
    "it could seem that contract models are significantly simpler than network models .",
    "more detailed consideration shows this is not the case .",
    "a contract model source is the contract text . to originate a model ,",
    "the text must accept a formalization .",
    "then a degree of detailed elaboration of the formalization depends on the function wherein the model is used .",
    "hence a contract model depends on functions wherein the contract or contract restrictions are used .",
    "therefore there is a contract model family corresponding to family of functions of planning , control , invoicing , etc .",
    "questions arise , how these models are connected with each other ; could they be connected formally and therefore automatically ; do they accept a uniform representation . in the paper ,",
    "there is proposed a contract model which represents an object consisting of :     a graph ;     an ordered set of feasible intervals of gas parameters such as gas demand , pressure , calorific value ;     price calculation procedures corresponding usually to the above intervals of gas parameters ;     integral quantities of gas .",
    "the paragraphs of a contract or of an operational agreement could be represented by elements attributed to edges of the contract network , i.e. to the connections between contract partners .    in the simplest case ,",
    "the contract network consists of a node , with which the feasible intervals of gas parameters and the procedures for calculation of gas prices and transport expenses correspond .",
    "let us remark that an edge can be taken instead of node equally in that case .",
    "moreover , it can be taken more than one edge or node , e.g. one edge for actual booking , the second one for communication , the third for accounting , and the force for operation . in",
    "particularly , this approach can be useful for the so called entry - exit economic models of contracts .",
    "such a contract model in form of a network causes different merits .",
    "it enables a simple , visualizable , structured and unified representation of contracts .",
    "it admits an automatic choice of degree of detailed elaboration of a contract model , i.e. auto - modelling due to automation of procedures of reduction or expansion ( re - reduction ) of contract network .",
    "a comparison of planning and invoicing functions allows to find a lot of similarities . in both cases",
    ", it handles with a gas distribution between the sources or targets correspondingly . but",
    "direction of time as well as of cumulative or de - cumulative operation is opposite by planning and invoicing .",
    "it is sufficient to compare a planning function of definition of purchase quantities covering an expected demand with an invoicing function of distribution of gas quantities metered on a client station over the contracts and contract conditions .    by planning function such as demand coverage ,",
    "the client demands are accumulated to define a total demand and to distribute demand through suppliers .",
    "the delivery ways from supplier to customer could be considered either implicitly by restrictions of maximal delivered gas quantities or explicitly by explicit representation of gas network structure .",
    "time is directed forwards , in the future .    by invoicing ,",
    "the metered gas quantities have to be distributed i.e. de - cumulated on a client station in accordance with contracts , contract partners and prices . for the most contracts ,",
    "the gas flow ways from measurement places to contract partners could be considered explicitly by explicit representation of client station structure .",
    "the graph theory gives a suitable means for that .",
    "time is directed backwards since information about the earlier purchased gas is processed .",
    "thus , the uniform modelling of pipelines , client stations and contracts by means of networks allows to represent their relations and producible operations explicitly , to visualize models , and it establishes a base for strict mathematical problem formulation .        the simplest representation of a contract is an object consisting of :    \\1 ) a node ;    \\2 ) an interval of feasible demand ;    \\3 ) an interval of feasible pressure ;    \\4 ) values of demand and pressure ;    \\5 ) a procedure for payment calculation .    a more complicated contract having an ordered set of feasible intervals of demand and pressure with corresponding procedures for invoicing shall be represented by a ( sub- ) network .",
    "such a model causes different merits .",
    "it enables a simple , visualizable , structural and unified representation of contracts .",
    "the unified contract representation is used for the following purposes and by the following implementations :     both for technical and economical objectives ;     for technical and contractual supervision of gas network in dispatcher center ;     for short and long term planning ;     by gas balancing for automation of checking and achievement of gas balance ;     by data acquisition from client stations , i.e. gas meter stations ;     by data preparation for settlement of accounts ;     to construct the data base of gas company .",
    "a client station is a gas meter station .",
    "it consists of :     shutting - off devices ;     means providing measuring of gas flow , pressure , temperature , and other ;     valves ;     control valves ;     service pipes .",
    "a shut - off station has the same structure as a client station .",
    "a difference is only that the flow meter and control valves are used rather seldom by shut - off stations .",
    "so the client and shut - off stations can be modelled in the same way .",
    "a gas meter station has a technical structure plotting as a scheme .",
    "a configuration scheme is represented by a ( sub- ) network .",
    "model of a gas meter station shall be a ( sub- ) network .",
    "station modelling by networks causes the same merits as contract modelling by networks .",
    "hence networks are used as models for gas networks , contracts , client and shut - off stations .",
    "a network is modelled as a graph that is equiped with flow and which nodes and edges possess parameters .",
    "nodes and edges possess technical parameters .",
    "pressure is considered explicitly .",
    "it is a nodal parameter .",
    "restrictions are formulated in terms of both pressure and flow .",
    "technical equipment as pipeline sections , compressor stations , control valves and valves are represented by edges of the network .",
    "the complicated compressor stations can be represented by sub - networks of the network .",
    "client and shut - off stations are represented by nodes of the network . the complicated client and shut - off stations can be represented by sub - networks of the network . if a contract is connected with only one client station and this station is represented by a node of the network then the contract is represented by the same node too .",
    "more complicated contracts can be represented by sub - networks of the network .    by computation of pressure drop ,",
    "the modelling procedures are used which simulate the operating of technical equipment",
    ". therefore computation of pressure drop can be very sophisticated .",
    "exactly as in network operation , a pipeline capacity is represented implicitly .",
    "this means that pipeline capacities are given due to maximal and minimal pressure limits in nodes of network .",
    "pressure limits arise owing to technical and contractual restrictions .",
    "there are two types of hydraulic simulation : a dynamic simulation and a steady state simulation .    in the dynamic simulation ,",
    "the partial differential equations are used to model hydraulic .",
    "the network parameters such as flow and pressure depend on time .    in the steady state simulation",
    ", the algebraic equations are used .",
    "the network parameters such as flow and pressure are taken at a certain moment or in average .",
    "a network optimization based on the hydraulic simulation considers restrictions and objective functions which are formulated in terms of both pressure and flow . as a result of optimization",
    ", the feasible and optimal hydraulic state of the whole network must be found and simulated .",
    "a network dynamic optimization , i.e. the network optimization based on the dynamic hydraulic simulation is not developed anywhere yet . a network steady state optimization , i.e. the network optimization based on the steady state hydraulic simulation is provided in wingas by methods and software accord developed there .      for short term planning ,",
    "the network steady state optimization by accord is a useful tool .",
    "when planning for serial time periods , the network steady state optimization can be used . for this purpose",
    "it must run several times sequentially for sequential moments .",
    "practically for long term planning it is possible rather often .",
    "but , for some cases , it can be expensive if not prohibited due to complexity of problem .",
    "for example , a feasibility of the network state must be checked every year for an extremely cold winter and for a summer which follows after the extremely cold winter .",
    "hence a planning for e.g. 25 years requires at least 50 feasibility checking of the network state .",
    "every feasibility checking of the network state is reduced to the solution of a network optimization problem based on the steady state hydraulic simulation .",
    "it means that accord must run 50 times . for complex networks represented in detail ,",
    "it requires such user efforts that can not be completed in a very short time .",
    "a network is modelled as a graph that is equiped with flow .",
    "edges dispose of flow . for nodes",
    "the value of demand or supply are considered .",
    "simulation of operation of technical equipment is not used .",
    "hydraulic simulation is not used either .",
    "pressure is considered implicitly .",
    "restrictions are formulated in terms of maximal flow that is capacity for every edge .",
    "pipeline capacities must be given as input data .",
    "capacity is an idealization that is not met by network operation .",
    "capacities simulate technical and contractual restrictions such as maximal and minimal pressure limits .",
    "a capacity does model implicitly the pressure limits .",
    "any client station and any contract is represented by a node . if necessary , a station and a contract can be represented by a sub - network of the network .    to optimize gas network without hydraulic simulation , flow models are use such as in the minimal cost network flow problem .",
    "let @xmath0 be a network with a node set @xmath1 and an edge set @xmath2 .",
    "the minimal cost network flow problem consists in :    @xmath3    subject to :    @xmath4    @xmath5    where : @xmath6 is flow in arc @xmath7 ; @xmath8 is cost of flow @xmath9 ; @xmath10 is supply or demand in node @xmath11 .",
    "the minimal cost network flow problem is much easier as a network optimization with hydraulic simulation .",
    "there are efficient methods delivering a solution of this problem .    for long term planning for serial time periods ,",
    "it is worthwhile to use a minimal cost network flow problem as a compromise simplification .",
    "it must run several times sequentially for sequential moments for this purpose . due to efficient solution methods",
    ", a planning for 25 years requiring 50 - 100 solutions of minimal cost network flow problem seems realistic .",
    "the correct investigation of capacities can turn out as a weakest point in such a simplified approach . here",
    "is useful a method for precise definition of pressure limits in a gas network .",
    "this method we have developed in 9 0 - 93 . normally by long term planning , the supplies and demands are considered as constant in every time period .",
    "hence it is allowed to use the said method for sub - networks that are defined by connected subsets of nodes which include terminal nodes and nodes of compressor stations .",
    "let be given a connected undirected network @xmath0 with a set of nodes @xmath1 and a set of edges @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath6 be the flow in the edge @xmath7 and @xmath12 be the supply or demand called intensity of node @xmath13 which satisfies the next conservation law :    @xmath14    @xmath15    the minimal cost network flow problem consists in @xmath16@xmath17    @xmath18    @xmath19    in the dual problem , the objective function depends on the differences of potentials @xmath20 i.e. on tension vectors @xmath21 the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions for the minimum cost network flow problems with linear or nonlinear objective functions are well known @xcite , @xcite . .",
    "they include the connection between pressures @xmath22 and flow @xmath6 in the form of equality and inequality system between the pressure differences and the left and right derivatives of the cost at the flow .",
    "they satisfy the following complementary slackness condition @xcite , @xcite in the necessary and sufficient optimality conditions @xmath23@xmath24@xmath25while the edge @xmath7 represents the equipment with input node @xmath11 and output node @xmath26 the equality ( [ q0 ] ) @xmath27represents the model of equipment , i.e. ohm s law , bernoulli s law etc . really ,",
    "if @xmath28 is linear ,    @xmath29 for quadratic @xmath28    @xmath30 for cubic @xmath28    @xmath31    let us generalize equipment models so that together with equations ( qrule ) connecting potential difference with a function of flow there can be considerable any function of flow and both potentials    @xmath32    to give a possibility to select the equipment , we come to the necessity to select the model , i.e. to choice the best equation from the equation set , we suppose that there are given the families of functional dependencies between flow and pressures :    @xmath33    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is a vector of continuous parameters ( coefficients ) , and @xmath36 is a discrete parameter on the edge @xmath7 .",
    "we suppose that there are given the limitations @xmath37",

    "the considered objective function depends both on flow qik and on pressures @xmath50 @xmath51 intensities @xmath52 continuous @xmath35 and discrete parameters @xmath53 .",
    "then the problem is :    @xmath54    @xmath55    we may interpret ( [ d7 ] ) as restrictions on the power , temperature , dissipation and other characteristics of the equipment that is represented by the edge @xmath7 .",
    "the set of available values of discrete parameters @xmath36 in ( [ d3 ] ) means that the family of functions @xmath56 can act on the edge @xmath7 , and we have to select the best function @xmath56 for an equation ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "thus , we have to select such equation ( [ d2 ] ) , which is the best for the objective function ( [ d8 ] ) .",
    "we may interpret this as a selection of the most profitable equipment , which is installed or can be installed on the place @xmath7 .",
    "the continuous parameters @xmath35 in ( [ d2 ] ) can be interpreted as parameters that smoothly regulate the work of equipment dik in bounds ( d6 ) .    the inequalities ( [ d4 ] ) and the dependence of objective function on intensities @xmath10 mean that the most profitable values of supplies and demands have to be chosen .    without concentration on the conditions of existence and uniqueness of the solution and on the proving of convergence to it",
    ", we describe the methods that work in practice and bring the solution of the formulated problem in the general case .",
    "advantages :    \\1 ) the network optimization with hydraulic simulation could be useful for both operational and economic optimization ;    \\2 ) the very broad range of technological restrictions can be considered ;    \\3 ) the broad range of objective functions can be considered , multi - objective problem can be modelled ;    \\4 ) steady state network simulation is provided ;    \\5 ) pressure is considered explicitly . restrictions and objective functions are formulated in terms of both pressure and flow ;    \\6 ) exactly as in network operation , capacity of pipelines are represented implicitly .",
    "this means that pipeline capacities are given due to maximal and minimal pressure limits in nodes of network .",

    "merits :    \\1 ) simplicity of models ;    \\2 ) in comparison with network optimization based on hydraulic simulation , the optimization based only on flow models usually needs not so much computational time and less efforts of user to get final results    demerits :    \\1 ) pressure is considered implicitly ;    \\2 ) pipeline capacities must be given as input data .",
    "they simulate technical and contractual restrictions such as maximal and minimal pressure limits only indirectly ;    \\3 ) the optimization based only on flow models has rather low technical reliability of results .",
    "the formulated problem ( [ d1 ] ) - ( [ d8 ] ) is a problem of constrained nonlinear mixed integer optimization , i.e. a problem of a search for an extremum for a function , which has continuous - discrete parameters of optimization and which undergoes nonlinear constraints . the objective function , constraints and parameters of optimization here are given on a network .. according to the mixing character of variables , the combination of the continuous and discrete optimization methods is used to solve the problem .",
    "the graph theory , integer programming , nonlinear programming with and without constraints and the methods of solving the nonlinear systems of equations and inequality are the basis of the offered method .",
    "its main characteristic feature consists in obtaining the dominant solutions on the specially constructed subnetworks .",
    "the discrete variable is e.g. the configuration of a compressor station , i.e. how much compressors have to be in operation and what scheme of their connection has to be used there . to manage the discrete variables , there are at least two methods in accord .",

    "the complementary variable @xmath58 will be penalized if it can not be represented by one of equations ( [ d2 ] ) .",
    "the difference between this method and the branch - and - bound approach is clear for the cases of pure discrete problems on a tree",
    ". such class of problems means that the network has no cycles and there are no continuous variables at all .",
    "then the second method can fall in a local optimum . to avoid it",
    ", a restart can be useful .",
    "for the same problem on a tree , the branch- and - bound method can be very efficient .",
    "it brings a global optimum as a solution .",

    "the graph of a tested gas network is presented on fig .",
    "the network consists of a central distributed ring with large - scale supply and transport pipelines .",
    "every edge is either a pipeline section or a compressor station .",
    "the input data for nodes are given in table 1 , for pipeline sections in table 2 , for compressor stations in table 3 .",
    "the main benefits of optimization are collected in table 4 .    as a first approximation for pressure drop on a pipeline ,",
    "there is used the simple formula for pressure drop on an aligned pipeline section    @xmath60    where : @xmath61 , @xmath62 - pressures respectively in inlet node @xmath11 and outlet ( `` exit '' ) node @xmath63 , [ bar ] ; @xmath64 - flow rate [ mm@xmath65/d ] , i.e. gas flow volume per day reduced to the standard temperature @xmath66 and pressure @xmath67 bar ; @xmath68 - pipeline length , [ km ] ; @xmath69 - coefficient defined by formula    @xmath70    where : @xmath2 - efficiency factor that is a relation between real and theoretical flow such that @xmath71 and @xmath72 for average operating conditions ; @xmath73 j / kgk - gas constant for air , @xmath74 kg / m@xmath65 - air normal density ; @xmath75 - hydraulic resistance coefficient defined e.g. after colebrook - white formula @xcite , p. 286 , @xmath76 $ ] ; @xmath77 - average gas compressibility , @xmath78 $ ] ; @xmath79 - gas specific density on air ( for air , @xmath80 ) ; @xmath81 - average gas temperature , @xmath82 $ ] ; @xmath83 - inside diameter of the @xmath11-th parallel pipe , @xmath84 $ ] ; here @xmath85 $ ] means a dimensionless value .",

    "efficiencies of other pipeline sections were varied to reach the feasible pressure area and to reproduce the initial operating conditions ( column `` @xmath69 initial '' of table 2 ) . on compressor stations ,",
    "the reproduction of initial operating conditions has been provided by using efficiency factor @xmath2 and with schemes of connection of equipment which are presented in table 3 in the columns `` efficiency factor '' and `` initial schemes '' respectively . for compressor ,",

    "the power expenditure is reduced from 260.765 mw to 234.432 mw that means 11.2 % decreasing .    from the presented data we can see that the solution of the optimization problem enables to find the feasible operating network conditions and to reduce the transport expenditure by 11.2 % as a result of selection of optimal equipment on the compressor stations no . 1 , 6 , 12 and 18 .",
    "we present the quality , supply and cost tracking computed by accord in consequence of optimization ( fig . 2 - 9 ) .",

    ". 4 and 5 are basis for the supply cost tracking presented in figs . 6 and 7 .",
    "we can see how the money for purchased gas is flowing along the pipeline per supply and in total , and how much the normalized costs of purchased gas and the addendum per supply for every consumer are .",
    "the operating expenses are depending on the fuel costs .",

    "supplies and demands , inlets and outlets of equipment are represented by the nodes of the network .",
    "the economic and operational problems solved in accord are formulated as continuous , discrete and discrete - continuous optimization on general network with given family of functional connections between flow and pressure .",
    "the continuous variables can be acted both in nodes and edges .",
    "pressures , flow and parameters of simulating models are examples of them .",
    "the discrete parameters correspond to edges .",
    "examples of them are internal structure of edges and types of simulating models of edges , i. e. of concrete functional dependencies between flow and pressure .",
    "the optimal equipment to operate can be selected .",
    "the generalization of the discrete characteristic of nodes such as `` the node is a source ( a sink ) '' is possible .    during optimization ,",
    "the methods adapt themselves to the concrete network and the features of both object function and variables .",
    "there is proposed a model of contracts having a set of feasible intervals of demand and pressure with corresponding procedures for payment calculation .",

    "the steady state optimization of gas network is a useful tool . for long term planning for serial time periods ,",
    "it is worthwhile to use the minimal cost network flow problem as a compromise simplification .",
    "the correct investigation of capacities can turn out as a weakest point in such a simplified approach . here",
    "a method @xcite is useful ; which we developed for precise definition of pressure margin in gas networks .",
    "steady state optimization by accord has been connected with dynamic simulation programs and has been integrated in the distributed control system gamos that consists of scada and various high level functions .",
