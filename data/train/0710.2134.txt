    "given a probability borel measure @xmath11 supported on the real line @xmath3 with infinite number of points of increase , we can build a sequence of orthonormal polynomials @xmath12 , @xmath13 , uniquely determined if all @xmath14 , such that @xmath15 beside their importance in approximation theory and multiple branches of applied and pure mathematics , orthogonal polynomials constitute a noteworthy object from the point of view of the information theory .",
    "this interest originated in the framework of the modern density functional theory @xcite , that states that the physical and chemical properties of fermionic systems ( atoms , molecules , nuclei , solids ) may be completely described by means of the single - particle probability density .",
    "for instance , if the solution of the time - independent schrdinger equation in a @xmath16-dimensional position space for an single particle system , @xmath17 is the wave function @xmath18 , then the position density of the system is @xmath19 .",
    "analogously , the wave function in momentum space @xmath20 , which is the fourier transform of @xmath21 , gives the momentum density @xmath22 .",
    "information measures of these densities are closely related to fundamental and experimentally measurable physical quantities , which makes them useful in the study of the structure and dynamics of atomic and molecular systems . for instance , the _ boltzmann - gibbs - shannon _ ( position - space ) _ entropy _ @xmath23 measures the uncertainty in the localization of the particle in space .",
    "lower entropy corresponds to a more concentrated wave function , with smaller uncertainty , and hence , higher accuracy in predicting the localization of the particle . the well known inequality @xcite @xmath24 is an expression of the position - momentum uncertainty principle , much stronger than the renowned heisenberg relation , that plays a major role in quantum mechanics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the study of the information measures of orthogonal polynomials is motivated by the fact that the densities of many quantum mechanical systems with shape - invariant potentials ( e.g. , the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogenic systems ) typically contain terms of the form @xmath25 .",
    "explicit formulas , numerical algorithms and asymptotic behavior have been studied both for the boltzmann - gibbs - shannon ( or differential ) entropy @xmath26 and for the the relative entropy ( or the kullback - leibler information ) @xmath27 see e.g.@xcite and the references therein . in particular , it has been shown that for chebyshev orthonormal polynomials of the first kind the relative entropy @xmath28 does not depend on @xmath2 , @xmath29 and that this value is asymptotically maximal among all orthogonality measures on @xmath30 $ ] ( see @xcite ) , giving a formal explanation to the intuitive notion that these polynomials are the most `` uniformly '' distributed ones .",
    "however , there are several discrete measures naturally associated with a sequence of orthogonal polynomials .",
    "the analysis of such measures requires the use of the `` genuine '' entropy studied by shannon . in order to stress the discrete character of this entropy ,",
    "hereafter we refer to it as _ shannon entropy _ and denote it by the letter @xmath31 .",
    "the evaluation of shannon entropy for discrete distributions is a basic question of information theory ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ; unlike for @xmath32 and @xmath28 , there are no known results for the shannon entropy of the orthogonal polynomials related distributions , due in part to the technical difficulties of the explicit evaluation of sums .",
    "it is well known that the orthonormal polynomials @xmath0 satisfy a three - term recurrence relation of the form @xmath33 using its coefficients we can define the @xmath34 jacobi matrix ( @xmath1 ) , @xmath35 which determines a self - adjoint linear operator ( discrete schrdinger operator ) @xmath36 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the canonical basis in @xmath39 , and we agree that @xmath40 . moreover , up to a constant factor , @xmath41 , which shows that the eigenvalues @xmath42 , @xmath43 , are the zeros of @xmath0 , and @xmath44 are eigenvectors corresponding to different eigenvalues .",
    "let @xmath45 denote the standard ( euclidean ) inner product in @xmath39 , and @xmath46 the @xmath2-th christoffel function .",
    "if we normalize @xmath47 then a consequence of the well known christoffel - darboux formula is that @xmath48 in other words , the @xmath34 matrix @xmath49 made of columns @xmath50 , @xmath5 , is orthogonal , so that the squares of the components of each ( column ) vector @xmath50 , @xmath5 , give a discrete probability distribution , and these distributions are mutually orthogonal in the sense of .",

    "shannon entropy _ reads @xmath53 . by jensen s inequality , @xmath54 and",
    "the maximum of corresponds to a uniform probability distribution . in this sense",
    ", it is quite natural to think of the shannon entropy as a measure of uncertainty",
    ".    we can give the following geometric interpretation to the shannon entropy .",
    "given in @xmath39 an orthonormal basis @xmath55 , any vector @xmath56 has a unique representation @xmath57 assume that @xmath58 , that is , @xmath59 , where @xmath60 means the euclidean norm . a natural way of measuring a relative distance of @xmath61 from the basis @xmath55 is by means of the shannon entropy @xmath62 indeed , if @xmath63 for a certain @xmath64 , then @xmath65 , and @xmath66 .",
    "on the contrary , if @xmath61 is `` equidistant '' from all vectors @xmath67 s , then all @xmath68 , and @xmath69 attains its maximum , @xmath70 .    motivated by the discussion above",
    ", we introduce the _ discrete entropy of orthonormal polynomials _",

    ", @xmath69 does not depend on the weight function @xmath75 , and is suitable both for discrete and continuous orthogonality ( cf .  some numerical experiments in section [ sec5 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath71 is an orthogonal matrix , its rows @xmath76 are also orthogonal vectors of @xmath39 : @xmath77 where @xmath78 is the normalized counting measure of zeros of @xmath0 : @xmath79 hence , we may define the dual discrete entropy , corresponding to rows of @xmath71 : @xmath80    a basic question of information theory is the evaluation of the shannon entropy . in this paper",

    "however , numerical experiments reveal the existence of certain picks , pointing downwards , whose position was not clear a priori ( see figure [ fig : entropy150 ] ) . the formulas presented below give a complete explanation of this phenomenon and exhibit nice connections with relevant objects from the number theory .    in order to state our results",
