    "couple - physics inverse problems or hybrid inverse problems is a research area that is interested in developing the mathematical framework for medical imaging modalities that combine the best imaging properties of different types of waves ( e.g. , optical waves , electrical waves , pressure waves , magnetic waves , shear waves , etc ) @xcite . in some applications of non - invasive medical imaging modalities ( e.g. , cancer detection )",
    "there is need for high contrast and high resolution images .",
    "high contrast discriminates between healthy and non - healthy tissue whereas high resolution is important to detect anomalies at and early stage @xcite .",
    "in some situation current methodologies ( e.g. , electrical impedance tomography , optical tomography , ultrasound , magnetic resonance ) focus only in a particular type of wave that can either recover high resolution or high contrast , but not both with the required accuracy .",
    "for instance , electrical impedance tomography ( eit ) and optical tomography ( ot ) are high contrast modalities because they can detect small local variations in the electrical and optical properties of a tissue .",
    "however because of their high instability they are characterized by their low resolution images @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , ultrasound tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are modalities that provide high resolution but not necessarily high enough contrast since the difference between the index of refraction of the healthy and non - healthy tissue is very small @xcite .",
    "the aim of hybrid inverse problems is to couple the physics of each wave to benefit from the imaging advantages of each one",
    ". some examples of this physical coupling are : ( i ) ultrasound modulated electrical impedance tomography ( umeit ) also known as acoustic - electro tomography ( aet ) or electro acoustic tomography ( eat ) @xcite ; ( ii ) current density impedance imaging ( cdii ) @xcite ; and ( iii ) ultrasound modulated optical tomography ( umot ) also known as acoustic optical tomography ( aot ) @xcite .",
    "all of these hybrid inverse problems involve two steps . in the first step the high resolution modality takes an input boundary measurements @xmath7 and provides an output internal functional of the form @xmath0 for @xmath8 , where @xmath2 is the solution of the elliptic partial differential equation @xmath3 on a bounded domain @xmath4 with boundary conditions @xmath5 .",
    "physically , @xmath6 is the unknown conductivity ( or diffusion coefficient ) and @xmath2 is the electric potential ( or photon - density ) of the tissue , depending on whether we are looking for electrical ( or optical ) properties of the tissue . in the second step",
    "the high contrast modality recovers the conductivity ( or diffusion coefficient ) @xmath6 from the knowledge of the internal functional @xmath0 for @xmath8 .",
    "different values of @xmath9 represent different physical couplings , in the case of cdii , @xmath9 equals 1 , and in the case of umeit and umot , @xmath9 equals @xmath10 .",
    "other internal functionals have been studied as well @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop a general approach to prove stability for the non linear second step of these hybrid inverse problems .",
    "we work with general functionals of the form @xmath0 , @xmath1 .",
    "we prove stability of the linearization , and hlder conditional stability for the non - linear problem . in the appendix",
    ", we generalize the abstract stability approach in @xcite to transfer conditional stability of the linearization to conditional stability of the non - linear problem .",
    "the behavior of the linearized problem depends on whether @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 as has been noted before , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "the case @xmath14 is the simplest one since the linearized operator becomes elliptic and thus stable . when @xmath15 , the linearized operator can be considered as one parameter family of elliptic operators on a family of hypersurfaces allowing us to show stability by superposition of elliptic operators . finally , when @xmath13 the linearized operator becomes hyperbolic , see also @xcite . for completeness in the exposition we analyze the case",
    "@xmath14 as well even though it does not appear in applications to medical imaging .",
    "a unified manner of dealing with the linearization of this problem was proposed in @xcite , for the cases @xmath14 and @xmath16 . in the first case they used one measurement , while in the second one , they required two measurements . in both cases",
    "they prove that the linearization is elliptic in the interior of the domain .",
    "this implies stability of the linearized problem , up to a finite dimensional kernel , without necessarily having injectivity .",
    "the conductivity @xmath6 in @xcite is perturbed by functions @xmath17 identically zero in a fixed neighborhood of the boundary .",
    "we allow perturbations in the whole domain , with appropriate boundary conditions .",
    "we use one boundary measurement even in the case @xmath15 ( cdii ) . for @xmath18 , we show stability , and hence injectivity , for the non - linear problem and its linearization . our approach is based on a factorization of the linearization , see below . instead of analyzing the linearization using the pseudo - differential calculus , we analyze the only non - trivial factor in the factorization , which happens to be a second order differential operator .    in the specific cases of @xmath15 and @xmath19 ,",
    "this hybrid inverse problems had been largely studied . for the case",
    "@xmath15 , inversion procedures and reconstruction were obtained in @xcite . in the case",
    "@xmath19 with several measurements , a numerical approach was proposed in @xcite in @xmath20 for conductivities zero near the boundary and in @xcite , a global estimate was established in @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath4 be a bounded simply connected open set of @xmath22 with smooth boundary .",
    "consider the strictly elliptic boundary value problem @xmath23 where @xmath6 is a function in @xmath24 such that @xmath25 in @xmath26 and @xmath27 , @xmath28 . by the schauder estimates ,",
    "we say @xmath2 is @xmath30harmonic if it satisfies equation .",
    "we address the question of whether we can determine @xmath6 , in a stable way , from the functional @xmath31 defined by @xmath32 with @xmath8 is fixed .",
    "this problem has different behavior depending on whether @xmath14 , @xmath15 or @xmath33 .",
    "we study stability of the non - linear problem by proving first stability for the linearization , see section  [ sec_2 ] , and then using theorem [ non - linear_stability_theorem ] . the latter is a generalization of the main result in @xcite , that allows to obtain stability for the non - linear problem from stability of the linearized problem .",
    "our main theorem about stability for the linearized problem is the following .",
