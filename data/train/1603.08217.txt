    "since graphene was created , two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials have been attracting a lot of attention due to their unique and exceptionally important properties and promising applications in next - generation electronic , optoelectronic , spintronic , and other novel devices@xcite .",
    "graphene , with massless dirac fermions weakly sensitive to backscattering and travelling at very high speed over very wide distances at room temperature@xcite , has superior performance , but its zero - gap behavior is an obstacle to switch current on and off in field - effect transistors ( fets ) , being inconsistent with modern semiconductor technology@xcite . as for other 2d compounds ,",
    "h - bn has a wide gap of 5.5 ev@xcite and on the other hand , mos@xmath1 monolayer , black phosphorene , and as monolayer have band gaps of 1.8 , 1.51 , and 2.49 ev@xcite , respectively .",
    "monolayer mos@xmath1 fet have been demonstrated with carrier mobility of 200 @xmath4v@xmath5s@xmath5 at room temperature , current on / off ratios of @xmath6 , and ultralow standby power dissipation@xcite .",
    "black p , arranged in a honeycomb puckered lattice , presents a high electron mobility of 1000 @xmath4v@xmath5s@xmath5 and high in - plane anisotropy@xcite .",
    "these 2d materials can be applied in nanoelectronic devices . however , the 2d semiconductors with band gaps of @xmath7 ev are highly desirable for rich applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices .    here ,",
    "we predict six 2d ii - v wide - band - gap semiconductors m@xmath0x@xmath1 ( m = zn , cd and x = n , p , as ) through systematical density functional theory ( dft ) calculations . the dilated graphene - like honeycomb structures of the 2d m@xmath0x@xmath1 ( m = zn , cd and x = n , p , as ) are formed according to normal valence rules that each group - iib m atom is surrounded by two group - v x atoms and each x is surrounded by three m atoms .",
    "the structural stability and feasibility of experimental realization of these 2d materials has been investigated in terms of dft structural optimization , phonon spectra , and total energy comparison with related existing 3d materials . on the experimental side ,",
    "similar two - coordinate structures of metallic atoms have been observed in various organic materials@xcite .",
    "our dft study shows that these 2d semiconductors have wide band gaps ranging from 2.74 to 3.81 ev and most of their effective carrier masses are from 0.03 to 0.05 @xmath3 .",
    "they may be potential materials for achieving novel transistors with high on / off ratios and optoelectronic devices working under violet or uv light .",
    "more detailed results will be presented in the following .",
    "our first - principles calculations are performed with the projector - augmented wave method as implemented in the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp)@xcite . the valence - electron configuration of group - iib m and group - v x are d@xmath8s@xmath9 and s@xmath9p@xmath10 , respectively .",
    "we use a slab model to simulate the 2d materials by adding a 15  thick vacuum layer to ensure the decoupling between different tri - layers ( consisting of one m layer and two x layers ) in the calculational model .",
    "a @xmath11-centered @xmath12 @xmath13-grid is employed and the plane wave energy cutoff is set to 500 ev .",
    "furthermore , the convergence criterium for the total energy is chosen to be 10@xmath14 ev . the cell geometry and the ionic positions",
    "are both optimized until the hellmann - feynmann forces on each atom become less than 0.01 ev /  . for structure optimization",
    ", we use the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) by perdew , burke and ernzerhof ( pbe)@xcite for the exchange - correlation potential . the electronic structures ( doss and bands )",
    "are calculated by both pbe and hybrid functional hse06.@xcite the latter is used to improve the theoretical description of the electronic structures , especially the semiconductor gaps .",
    "phonon spectra are calculated based on phonopy@xcite .",
    "for constructing reasonable 2d structures for m@xmath0x@xmath1 ( m = zn , cd and x = n , p , as ) , the valences of group - iib m and group - v x must be taken into account .",
    "first , we can assume that m and x are in the same plane and form a 2d dilated - honeycomb structure ( space group p6/mmm ) , in which each m has two x neighbors and each x has three m ones .",
    "this structure has the same rotational symmetry as grapheme , but the c atom at the hexagonal vertex is replaced by x atom and there is an m atom at the middle of each dilated hexagonal edge of the honeycomb unit .",
    "there are six m and six x atoms in the hexagon of the honeycomb unit .",
    "unfortunately , this structure is unstable against a buckling of x atoms from the plane .",
    "the buckling , keeping the three - fold rotational symmetry , makes two x planes remain symmetrically astride the m plane and it can be parameterized with the distance @xmath15 between the m plane and both of the two x planes .",
    "this buckling makes the space group reduce to p@xmath16m1 , but lowers the total energy by 0.042 , 1.027 , 1.419 , 0.215 , 1.076 , and 1.476 ev per formula unit for the zn@xmath0n@xmath1 , zn@xmath0p@xmath1 , zn@xmath0as@xmath1 , cd@xmath0n@xmath1 , cd@xmath0p@xmath1 , and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 , respectively . with the optimized @xmath15 value and the 2d crystal lattice constant @xmath17 , we can calculate the m - x bond length @xmath18 .",
    "we summarize @xmath17 , @xmath15 , and @xmath18 values in table i , and present the 2d crystal structure in figs .",
    "1(a)-(c ) .",
    "it is clear that this 2d structure can be seen as a dilated , buckled honeycomb structure like graphene .",
    "to better demonstrate the effect of the buckling , we present the total energy of the 2d cd@xmath0as@xmath1 as a function of @xmath15 in fig .",
    "1(d ) because of the largest buckling in this case .",
    "furthermore , we have calculated the phonon spectra in all the six cases .",
    "the phonon spectra of the 2d cd@xmath0n@xmath1 as the representative are presented in fig .",
    "because there is no soft phonon mode , there is no kinetic instability for any of the six 2d m@xmath0x@xmath1 ( m = zn , cd and x = n , p , as ) materials@xcite .",
    ".calculated 2d lattice constant @xmath17 , buckling parameter @xmath15 , and m - x bond length @xmath18 of the 2d ii - v materials of m@xmath0x@xmath1 ( m = zn , cd and x = n , p , as ) .",
    "also presented are calculated energy difference values per atom , @xmath19 , between the 2d m@xmath0x@xmath1 materials and the 3d bulk m@xmath0x@xmath1 with space group ia@xmath16 ( for bulk zn@xmath0n@xmath1 and cd@xmath0n@xmath1)@xcite and space groups p4@xmath1/nmc and p4@xmath132 ( for bulk m@xmath0x@xmath1 with m = zn , cd and x = p , as)@xcite . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the cation ( zn or cd ) has a nominal valence of 2 + and the anion ( n , p , or as ) a nominal valence of 3- . actually , the bond is not purely ionic and part of it is covalent , which can be shown by the nonzero weight of the filled zn ( or cd ) s state in fig .",
    "4 . consequently",
    ", the valence bands in fig . 3 are originated mainly from the p states of the anion and the conduction bands mainly from the s states of the cation .",
    "this can be seen through comparing fig . 3 and fig .",
    "4 that the partial doss ( projected in the atomic muffin tins ) of the conduction bands are substantially smaller than those of the valence bands , and therefore the wave functions of the conduction bands are mainly in the interstitial region , being more extended in the real space .",
    "the incomplete transferring of the cation s electrons in the 2d ii - v semiconductors is partly because the cation has only two coordinates and partly because the bond includes some covalence as it does in usual ii - vi semiconductors .    at this stage , however , one may ask such a question : can the 2d ii - v semiconductors including two - coordinate cations ( zinc or cadmium ) be experimentally realized ? on the theoretical side , we have shown through dft calculated phonon spectra and total energy comparison with existing 3d materials that these 2d ii - v semiconductor materials are structurally stable and should be experimentally realizable , although the cation has only two coordinates . on the experimental side , it has been already shown that one zinc ( and other transition metal ) atom can indeed have two coordinates in various organic materials including zinc ( and other transition metals)@xcite .",
    "therefore , the answer is certain .",
    "the semiconductor gaps in these 2d semiconductors are between that of h - bn and those of mos@xmath1 , black p , and as monolayer@xcite .",
    "the effective hole masses of the 2d zn@xmath0n@xmath1 and cd@xmath0n@xmath1 are slightly less than those of 2d mos@xmath1 , antimonene , and arsenene , but most of the effective carrier ( either hole or electron ) masses range from 0.03 to 0.05 @xmath3.@xcite their 2d dilated honeycomb structure makes them be structurally compatible with most of the promising 2d materials , and thus they can be used to form hybrid structures with other 2d materials in order to design novel electronic , spintronic , optoelectronic , and other devices@xcite .",
    "in summary , we have predicted the six two - dimensional ( 2d ) wide - band - gap ii - v semiconductor materials m@xmath0x@xmath1 ( m = zn , cd and x = n , p , as ) with a dilated , buckled graphene - like honeycomb structure . the structural stability and feasibility of experimental realization of these 2d materials",
    "has been shown through dft phonon spectra and total energy comparison with related existing 3d materials .",
    "they are also supported by the fact that there have already been many similar two - coordinate structures of zn and other metallic atoms in various organic materials@xcite .",
    "our dft study has shown that the zn@xmath0n@xmath1 , zn@xmath0p@xmath1 , and zn@xmath0as@xmath1 are direct band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 2.87 , 3.81 , and 3.55 ev , and however , the cd@xmath0n@xmath1 , cd@xmath0p@xmath1 , and cd@xmath0as@xmath1 are indirect band gap semiconductors with band gaps of 2.74 , 3.51 , and 3.29 ev , respectively .",
    "the dilated , buckled honeycomb structure enriches the family of two - dimensional materials .",
    "our further dft calculations show that the effective hole masses of the 2d zn@xmath0n@xmath1 and cd@xmath0n@xmath1 are slightly less than that of well - known 2d mos@xmath1 , and each of the six 2d materials has effective carrier ( either hole or electron ) masses down to 0.03 to 0.05 @xmath3 , having potential to achieve high carrier mobility .",
    "therefore , these 2d ii - v semiconductors may have promising applications in future electronic and optoelectronic devices .",
