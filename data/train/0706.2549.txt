    "the amount and the timing of appearance of the transcriptional product of a gene is mostly determined by regulatory proteins through biochemical reactions that enhance or block polymerase binding at the promoter region ( @xcite ) . considering that many genes code for regulatory proteins that can activate or repress other genes , the emerging picture is conveniently summarized as complex network where the genes are the nodes , and",
    "a link between two genes is present if they interact .",
    "the identification of these networks is becoming one of the most relevant task of new large - scale genomic technologies such as dna microarrays , since gene networks can provide a detailed understanding of the cell regulatory system , can help unveiling the function of previously unknown genes and developing pharmaceutical compounds .",
    "different approaches have been proposed to describe gene networks ( see ( @xcite ) for a review ) , and different procedures have been proposed ( @xcite ) to determine the network from experimental data .",
    "this is a computationally daunting task , which we address in the present work .",
    "here we describe the network via deterministic evolution equations ( @xcite ) , which encode both the strenght and the direction of interaction between two genes , and we discuss a novel reverse engineering procedure to extract the network from experimental data .",
    "this procedure , though remaining a quantitative one , realizes one of the most important goal of modern system biology , which is the integration of data of different type and of knowledge obtained by different means .",
    "we assume that the rate of synthesis of a transcript is determined by the concentrations of every transcript in a cell and by external perturbations . the level of gene transcripts is therefore seen to form a dynamical system which in the most simple scenario is described by the following set of ordinary differential equations ( @xcite ) : @xmath0 where @xmath1 is a vector encoding the expression level of @xmath2 genes at times @xmath3 , and @xmath4 a vector encoding the strength of @xmath5 external perturbations ( for instance , every element @xmath6 could measure the density of a specific substance administered to the system ) . in this scenario the gene regulatory network is the matrix @xmath7 ( of dimension @xmath8 ) , as the element @xmath9 measures the influence of gene @xmath10 on gene @xmath11 , with a positive @xmath9 indicating activation , a negative one indicating repression , and a zero indicating no interaction .",
    "the matrix @xmath12 ( of dimension @xmath13 ) encodes the coupling of the gene network with the @xmath5 external perturbations , as @xmath14 measures the influence of the @xmath15-th perturbation on the @xmath11-th gene .",
    "a critical step in our construction is the choice of a linear differential system .",
    "even if a such kind of model is based on particular assumptions on the complex dynamics of a gene network , it seem the only practical approach due to the lack of knowledge of real interaction mechanism between thousands of genes",
    ". even a simple nonlinear approach would give rise to an intractable amount of free parameters .",
    "however , it must also be recognized that all other approaches or models have weakness points .",
    "for instance , boolean models ( which have been very recently applied to inference of networks from time series data , as in ( @xcite ) , strongly discretize the data and select , _ via _ the use of an arbitrary threshold , among active and inactive gene at every time - step .",
    "dynamical bayesian models , instead , are more data demanding than linear models due to their probabilistic nature",
    ". moreover , their space complexity grows like @xmath16 ( at least in the famous reveal algorithm by k.p .",
    "murphy ( @xcite ) ) , which makes this tool suitable for small networks .    the linear model of eq .",
    "( [ eq - cont ] ) is suitable to describe the response of a system to small external perturbations .",
    "it can be recovered by expanding to first order , and around the equilibrium condition @xmath17 , the dependency of @xmath18 on @xmath19 and @xmath4 , @xmath20 .",
    "stability considerations ( @xmath21 must not diverge in time ) require the eigenvalues of @xmath7 to have a negative real part .",
    "moreover it clarifies that if the perturbation @xmath4 is kept constant the model is not suitable to describe periodic systems , like cell cycles for example , since in this case @xmath21 asymptotically approaches a constant .",
    "unfortunately data from a given cell type involve thousands of responsive genes @xmath2 .",
    "this means that there are many different regulatory networks activated at the same time by the perturbations , and the number of measurements ( microarray hybridizations ) in typical experiments is much smaller than @xmath2 .",
    "consequently , inference methods can be successful , but only if restricted to a subset of the genes ( i.e. a specific network ) ( @xcite ) , or to the dynamics of genes subsets .",
    "these subsets could be either gene clusters , created by grouping genes sharing similar time behavior , or the modes obtained by using singular value decomposition ( svd ) . in these cases",
    "it is still possible to use eq .",
    "( [ eq - cont ] ) , but @xmath21 must be interpreted as a vector encoding the time variation of the clusters centroids , or the time variation of the characteristics modes obtained via svd .    in this paper",
    "we present a method for the determination of the matrices @xmath7 and @xmath12 starting from time series experiments using a global optimization approach to minimize an appropriate figure of merit . with respects to previous attempts ,",
    "our algorithm as the uses explicitly the insight provided by earlier studies on gene regulatory networks ( @xcite ) , namely , that gene networks in most biological systems are sparse . in order to code such type of features the problem itself must be formulated as mixed - integer nonlinear optimization one ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover our approach is intended to explicitly incorporate prior biological knowledge as , for instance , it is possible to impose that : @xmath22 @xmath23 if it is known that gene @xmath10 inhibits ( does not influence , activates , influences ) gene @xmath11 .",
    "this means that the optimization problem is subject to inequality and/or equality constraints .",
    "summing up the characteristics of the problem we must solve : high dimensionality , mixed integer , nonlinear programming problem for the exact solution of which no method exists .",
    "an approximate solution can be found efficiently using a global optimization techniques ( @xcite ) based on an intelligent stochastic search of the admissible set .",
    "as consequence of the optimization method used , there is no difficulties to integrates different time series data investigating the response of the same set of genes to different perturbations , even if different time series are sampled at different ( and not equally spaced ) time points .",
    "the integration of different time series is a major achievement , as it allows for the joint use of data obtained by different research groups.we believe that the integration of multiple time - series dataset in unveiling a gene network is a topic of great interest as focused in recently published papers ( @xcite ) .",
    "we illustrate and test the validity of our algorithm on computer simulated gene expression data , and we apply it to an experimental gene expression data set obtained by perturbing the sos system in bacteria _",
    "the simplest assumption regarding the dynamical response of gene transcripts ( intially in a steady state , @xmath24 for @xmath25 ) , to the appearance of an external perturbation @xmath26 at time @xmath27 is given by eq .",

    "this is the only way that enable us to incorporate the sparseness requirement on @xmath51 and eventually available biological priors .",
    "it is clear that sparseness was destroyed by exponentiation and integration involved in the continuous - discrete transformation of the problem , in the same way simple bounds on @xmath51 elements are transformed in highly complex nonlinear relations on @xmath52 .",
    "the price paid for the flexibility of the approach is the computational effort required for any computation of the error function .",

    "we detail now our procedure to find the spare matrices @xmath7 and @xmath12 minimizing @xmath45 , , which is in general a formidable task .",

    "these numbers prove that by exploiting the time reversibility of the equation of motion , and the sparseness of the gene network , is it possible to estimate the parameters of the network with a greater accuracy , as also shown in fig .",

    "there are two major problems encountered when trying to infer a gene network via the analysis of time - series data .",
    "the first one is that there are usually to few time - points with respect to the large number of genes .",
    "the second one is associated to the fact that , when the system responds to an external perturbation , only the expression of the genes directly or indirectly linked to that perturbation changes , i.e. , only a specific sub - network of the whole gene network is _ activated _ by the external perturbation .",
    "while through the study of the time - series it is possible to learn something about the regulatory role of the responding genes , nothing can be learnt about the regulatory role of the non - responding genes .",
    "these problems can be addressed by using gene network retrieval procedures which are able to simultaneously analyze different time - series ( @xcite ) , particularly if these measure the response of the system to different perturbations , as we expect different perturbations to activate different genes .",
    "our reverse engineering approach naturally exploits the presence of multiple time series by requiring the minimization of eq .",

    "we study the network discussed in the previous example by adding to the time - series shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , other ones generated by the application of two different perturbations . for sake of simplicity all time - series are measured at equally - spaced time - points , but with an elapsing time between two consecutive data points depending on the particular time - series .",
    "hence that the problem can not be reduced to the one of a single average time - series by exploiting the linearity of eq .",
    "( [ eq - cont ] ) .    as the number of time - series increases , our determination of the gene network @xmath7 becomes more and more accurate .",
    "for instance , while by means of a single perturbation we obtain @xmath129 ( @xmath136 ) , by using two time - series we obtain @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) , and by using three time series we get @xmath139 ( @xmath140 ) .",

    "<S> we present a reverse engineering algorithm able to reveal the underlying gene network by using time - series dataset on gene expressions considering the system response to different perturbations . </S>",
    "<S> the approach is able to determine the sparsity of the gene network , and to take into account possible _ a priori _ biological knowledge on it . </S>",
    "<S> the validity of the reverse engineering approach is highlighted through the deduction of the topology of several _ simulated _ gene networks , where we also discuss how the performance of the algorithm improves enlarging the amount of data or if any a priori knowledge is considered . </S>",
    "<S> we also apply the algorithm to experimental data on a nine gene network in _ escherichia coli_. </S>"
