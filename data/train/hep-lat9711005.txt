    "formulation of the heavy quark on the lattice , such as nrqcd@xcite or the fermilab approach with the wilson - like relativistic quarks@xcite , requires perturbative matching with the continuum theory .",
    "since the quark mass in the lattice unit can not be neglected for these theories , the perturbative calculation is much more involved and have not developed as that for the massless case .",
    "we report the current status of our effort to calculate the one - loop coefficients of the perturbative @xmath0-factor @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "it is particularly important to calculate the mass dependence of the axial - current @xmath0-factor @xmath2 , which is required for the calculation of the @xmath3 meson decay constant @xmath4 , since the one - loop coefficient in the static limit is known to be very large@xcite .",
    "the combinations of the heavy and light quark actions we investigate in this report are listed in table [ tab : mmm ] .",
    "the wilson and clover heavy quarks are used with the fermilab group s non - relativistic interpretation@xcite , with which the relativistic actions can be treated in parallel with nrqcd for heavy quarks , since the both methods are based on the small spatial momentum expansion , or equivalently the @xmath5 expansion .",
    "and in particular the both methods have the identical static limit .",
    "the earlier works for the lattice perturbative calculation for nrqcd can be found in refs.@xcite .",
    "advanced studies using nrqcd - clover actions are also reported by j.  shigemitsu and a.  ali - khan@xcite .",

    "let us present the operator matching problem taking the axial - vector current as an example .",
    "the matrix element of the time component of the axial - vector current @xmath6 for the free heavy and light quark external fields having momenta @xmath7 and @xmath8 have the following form : @xmath9h\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 is a light quark 4-component spinor , @xmath11 is a heavy quark 2-component spinor , and the coefficients @xmath12 are functions of the bare quark mass @xmath13 .",
    "the first term gives the leading contribution surviving in the static limit , and the second and third terms contribute to the @xmath14 and @xmath15 corrections .",
    "we have to match the continuum ( @xmath16 ) and the lattice theories to give the same matrix elements .",
    "the matching of the tree level coefficients @xmath17 and @xmath18 is almost trivial , and we have calculated in this study the one - loop correction @xmath19 , which gives the multiplicative @xmath0-factor @xmath2 , for all combinations of the heavy and light quark actions .",
    "the remaining coefficients @xmath20 and @xmath21 must be calculated to achieve higher accuracy .",
    "we use two types of the nrqcd action including terms through @xmath22 for the heavy quark .",
    "the actions are given by @xmath23 , \\hspace{1mm}\\mbox{type $ a$ } , \\label{eqn : a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and @xmath24 , \\hspace{2mm}\\mbox{type $ b$ } , \\label{eqn : b}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the effective 2-component spinor field .",
    "@xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] are defined as usual .",
    "the original 4-component spinor field @xmath28 is related via foldy - wouthuysen - tani transformation through @xmath22 : @xmath29 then the lattice current operators at tree level can be written as @xmath30    we calculate the multiplicative part of current renormalization factors @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the one - loop corrections for the continuum and lattice ( axial-)vector currents .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the @xmath34 dependence of @xmath35 . we have applied the tadpole improvement using the average plaquette for the mean link variable .",
    "the axial - vector current in the continuum ( @xmath16 scheme ) is defined with the totally anti - commuting @xmath36 .",
    "we observe that the time - component of the axial - vector current and the spatial component of the vector current have a large @xmath34 dependence , and in the static limit we reproduce the value @xmath370.1346 for the axial - vector current@xcite .",
    "this large dependence has an impact on the calculation of @xmath4 . for a typical value of the lattice spacing",
    "the heavy quark mass becomes @xmath38=1.82.5 , and the difference of @xmath2 from the static value could be large as @xmath39 10% .",
    "the mass dependence of the time component of the vector current is rather mild , on the other hand .",
    "a similar behavior is observed for the type @xmath3 action .",
    "the renormalization factors for the wilson - wilson and clover - clover heavy - light current are calculated in a similar manner as the nrqcd - wilson case .",

    "the coefficient @xmath46 is small ( @xmath39 0.1 or smaller ) around the b - quark mass region and we neglect in this study .",
    "the one - loop coefficient for the time component of the vector and axial - vector currents is shown in figure [ fig2n ] for wilson - wilson and clover - clover as well as nrqcd - wilson .",
    "we apply the tadpole improvement by using the critical hopping parameter to define the mean link variable for the relativistic actions .",
    "overall tendencies of the mass dependence are similar for all actions , except in the lighter heavy quark mass region , where the results for the relativistic actions tend to have smaller mass dependence while the nrqcd - wilson result still has large slope .",
    "the mass dependences for the vector current are weak compared with that for the axial - vector current .",
    "we have investigated the heavy quark mass dependence of multiplicative part of the renormalization factors for the heavy - light currents systematically using nrqcd , wilson , and clover actions .",
