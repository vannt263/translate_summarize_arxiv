    "<S> we study high - field phase diagram and low - energy excitations of three - dimensional quantum helimagnets . slightly below the saturation field </S>",
    "<S> , the emergence of magnetic order may be mathematically viewed as bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons . </S>",
    "<S> the method of dilute bose gas enables an unbiased quantitative analysis of quantum effects in three - dimensional helimagnets and thereby three phases are found : cone , coplanar fan and an attraction - dominant one . to investigate the last phase , we extend the usual bec approach so that we can handle 2-magnon bound states . in the case of 2-magnon bec , the transverse magnetization vanishes and long - range order occurs in the quadrupolar channel ( spin - nematic phase ) . as an application </S>",
    "<S> , we map out the phase diagram of a 3d helimagnet which consists of frustrated @xmath0-@xmath1 chains coupled by an interchain interaction @xmath2 .    </S>",
    "<S> magnetic frustration introduces several competing states which are energetically close to each other and thereby destabilizes simple ordered states . </S>",
    "<S> one way to compromise two or more competing orders is to assume a helical ( spiral ) spin structure@xcite . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we discuss the high - field behavior of a spin-1/2 heisenberg model with generic interactions : @xmath3 for the simplest case with one magnetic ion per unit cell , one can easily find the classical ground state by minimizing the fourier transform of the exchange interactions : @xmath4 where the summation is taken over all @xmath5-sites connected to the @xmath6-site by @xmath7 . when @xmath8 takes its minima @xmath9 at @xmath10 , helical order with the wave number @xmath11 or @xmath12 appears ( @xmath13 are not equivalent to each other ) . </S>",
    "<S> when the external magnetic field is applied in a direction perpendicular to the spiral plane , the spiral at h=0 is smoothly deformed into the so - called _ cone _ state ( figure [ fig : cone - fan ] ) as h is increased and this persists until all spins eventually get polarized at the saturation field @xmath14 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one of the simplest models which exhibit , at least in the classical limit , the helical order is a three - dimensionally coupled heisenberg chains with nearest - neighbor- ( nn ) @xmath0 and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) @xmath1 coupling . </S>",
    "<S> rise of multiferroics revives study of helimagnetism and many compounds which contain these 1d - chains as subsystems have been reported ( see , for instance , table i. in reference @xcite ) . for example </S>",
    "<S> , a helimagnetic material licuvo@xmath15 may be viewed as coupled quantum s = 1/2 @xmath0-@xmath1 chains and exhibits helical spin order , which is expected from the classical theories , and ferroelectricity simultaneously under moderate magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> when the field is very high , on the other hand , this compound shows modulated collinear order , which contradicts with the aforementioned classical prediction , and this may suggest that quantum fluctuation plays an important role @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it would be interesting to explore the possibility that quantum fluctuation replaces the classical cone state with other stable ones .    by using dilute - bose - gas approach , </S>",
    "<S> batyev and braginskii @xcite investigated magnetic structures near saturation ( h = h@xmath16 ) and concluded that a new coplanar fan phase appears if a certain condition for the bosonic interactions is satisfied . </S>",
    "<S> our aim in this letter is to determine the stable spin configurations of a specific 3d spin-1/2 helimagnet in a fully quantum - mechanical manner .    </S>",
    "<S> ladder diagram of the interaction vertex ]    ladder diagram of the interaction vertex ]    _ general formalism_ by taking fully polarized state as the vacuum and treating spin - flips as hardcore bosons @xmath17 , @xmath18 , we can rewrite the spin hamiltonian as : @xmath19 @xmath20 where @xmath21 has been added to insure the hard - core constraint and the minimum of @xmath22 is taken @xmath23 for helimagnets . in </S>",
    "<S> what follows , we consider a cubic lattice ( we reserve @xmath24 to label the three crystal axes ) and assume that helical- and ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic order occur along the @xmath25-axis and in the @xmath26 plane , respectively ( i.e. @xmath27 or @xmath28 ) . on general grounds , we may expect that magnon bec occurs when the external field is @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the thermal potential per site @xmath31 of the dilute bose gas is determined by the renormalized interaction ( @xmath32-matrix ) among the condensed bosons at @xmath33 and the ground state densities @xmath34 are obtained by minimizing @xmath31 . if we denote the renormalized interactions between the like bosons and that between the different ones respectively as @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the energy density @xmath31 is given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> different phases appear according to the values of @xmath39 . when @xmath40 , @xmath31 is minimal for the choice @xmath41 , @xmath42 ( or vice versa ) and @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> then , the spin configuration is determined as : @xmath44 that is , the cone state ( the left panel of figure [ fig : cone - fan ] ) , which exists already in the classical case @xcite , is favored for @xmath45 .    </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath46 and @xmath47 , on the other hand , the two modes condense simultaneously and the ground state is determined as : @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xmath50 the existence of the two phases @xmath51 and @xmath52 , which correspond respectively to the two condensates @xmath53 and @xmath54 , lead to two different low - energy excitations . </S>",
    "<S> since @xmath55 , the spins assume a coplanar configuration ( _ fan _ ) shown in the right panel of figure [ fig : cone - fan ] . according to the standard theory @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , this phase does not exhibit ferroelectricity .    </S>",
    "<S> in these two bose condensed phases , there exists two low - energy modes at @xmath56 and the low - energy physics is described by the effective lagrangian with u(1)@xmath57 u(1 ) symmetry ; one comes from the axial ( around the external field ) symmetry and the other from an emergent translational symmetry . in the cone phase , only one of the two bosons condenses and there is one gapless goldstone mode ( the two u(1)s are no longer independent ) . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the fan phase breaks both symmetries and has two types of gapless goldstone modes(for more detail , see reference @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath58 or @xmath59 , low - energy bosons around @xmath60 attract each other . </S>",
    "<S> if the energy ( [ effpotential ] ) is taken literally , one may expect , on general grounds , first order transitions to occur ( provided that the cubic terms of @xmath61 are positive ) </S>",
    "<S> . however , eq.([effpotential ] ) is based on the assumption that magnon bec occurs in the _ single - magnon channel _ and may not work when we expect magnon bound states stabilized by strong attraction . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , according to the standard bethe - salpeter method , divergingly large ( renormalized ) attraction implies the existence of stable 2-magnon bound states as a pole in the two - particle green s function corresponds to a bound state . therefore , the simple single - magnon becs will give way to those in multi - particle channel . to check the above scenario </S>",
    "<S> , we solve the 2-magnon scattering problem . </S>",
    "<S> we denote the ladder diagram as @xmath62 ( see figure [ fig : ladder ] ) , where we take the total energy of initial state as @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> then , on the fully saturated ground state , the exact scattering amplitude @xmath64 is obtained by solving the following integral equation : @xmath65 even in the presence of the boson condensate , as long as it is dilute , we can safely use this scattering amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> hence , one obtains the renormalized interaction @xmath66 and @xmath67 as @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the pole of @xmath69 gives the stable bound state .    </S>",
    "<S> _ coupled @xmath0-@xmath1 model_ having established the formalism , we proceed to investigating a specific model  a frustrated spin-1/2 model on a simple cubic lattice whose hamiltonian is given by @xmath70 in ( [ eqn : j1-j2-j3 ] ) , the @xmath71-@xmath72 chains are running in the @xmath25-direction and @xmath73 controls the coupling among adjacent chains . </S>",
    "<S> the wave number @xmath74 characterizing the condensate is given either by @xmath75 ( @xmath76 ) or by @xmath77 ( @xmath78 ) where @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> hence the spiral occurs in the @xmath25-direction . to determine the spin structure of our @xmath71-@xmath72-@xmath73 model </S>",
    "<S> , we solved eq.([laddereq ] ) by assuming the following form @xcite : @xmath80 , where @xmath81 and @xmath82 are functions of @xmath83 and @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> after some numerical calculations , we obtained the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig : quasi1d ] . </S>",
    "<S> we show only the frustrated region @xmath85 , where cone structure with incommensurate @xmath74 is expected classically .    ) </S>",
    "<S> mapped out in @xmath86-plane ( @xmath87 is used to set the energy unit ) . </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ cone phase _ and ( ii ) _ coplanar fan phase _ are one - magnon condensed phases . in the phase-(iii ) , attractive interaction may imply instabilities toward other phases e.g. conventional ferromagnetic one or more exotic multipolar ones . </S>",
    "<S> the phase ( iv ) ( _ nematic _ ) is characterized by the condensation of the 2-magnon bound state and leads to the nematic order in the transverse direction . </S>",
    "<S> the region @xmath88 is omitted for a reason described in the text . </S>",
    "<S> inset : the same phase diagram for the large negative interchain coupling ( @xmath89 ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quasi1d ] ]    for @xmath90 , low - energy quantum fluctuation destabilizes @xmath91 and our approach can not be extended to @xmath92 continuously ( @xmath91 becomes @xmath93 ) and @xmath94 at the leading order in @xmath2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , we compare the phase diagram shown in figure [ fig : quasi1d ] with that of the 1d @xmath71-@xmath72 chain ( @xmath95 ) . </S>",
    "<S> let us begin with the case @xmath96 . </S>",
    "<S> near saturation , two dominant phases are found in 1d @xcite : ( i ) ` chiral phase ( vc ) ' with finite vector chirality parallel to the magnetic field and ( ii ) ` tl2 ' phase where the system is described by two tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquids . obviously , the former turns , after switching on @xmath73 , into the cone phase . </S>",
    "<S> a close inspection of the two gapless tl modes near saturation tells us that the tl2 phase should be identified with the fan phase here .    </S>",
    "<S> for the ferromagnetic case @xmath97 , becs of @xmath98-bound magnon states ( @xmath99 2 ) are expected in 1d chain @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we found how strong inter - chain coupling destabilizes the 2-bound magnon bec . </S>",
    "<S> the study of the stability of higher @xmath98-bound magnon state ( @xmath100 ) in 3d is a future problem . </S>"
