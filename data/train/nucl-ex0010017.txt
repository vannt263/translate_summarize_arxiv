    "color singlet states observed so far state has been reported@xcite ] consist of three quarks ( baryons ) , three antiquarks ( antibaryons ) or quark - antiquark pairs ( mesons ) .",
    "these states are described by the standard model which does not forbid the existence of color singlet states in a bag containing an integer multiple of three quarks . in such quark matter states all the quarks",
    "are free within the hadron s boundary and so are inherently different from nuclear states that are composed of a conglomerate of a = 1 baryons .",
    "quark matter states composed of only up and down quarks are known to be less stable than normal nuclei of the same baryon number a and charge z since nuclei do not decay into quark matter .",
    "this is because of the relatively large fermi energy of two - flavor quark matter .",
    "strange quark matter ( sqm ) , composed of strange as well as up and down quarks , has several stabilizing factors that could result in quasistable states .",
    "the presence of strange quarks lowers the fermi energy and the most stable configurations for a given a would have roughly equal numbers of up , down and strange quarks with charges of + 2/3e , -1/3e and -1/3e , respectively , therefore minimizing the surface and coulomb energies .",
    "a major destabilizing factor is the large mass of the strange quark .",
    "the above factors imply that the most stable varieties of strange quark matter should have a low value of z / a and increase in stability with mass number .",
    "the property of low z / a provides the basis for current sqm searches at heavy ion accelerators .      chin and kerman @xcite in 1979 predicted that sqm with @xmath21 might be metastable with halflife@xmath22 .",
    "these predictions used quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) and the mit bag model of hadrons @xcite to treat sqm quantitatively .",
    "subsequently , similar calculations with the addition of shell effects were carried out by farhi and jaffe @xcite and gilson and jaffe @xcite .",
    "all theories contain the prediction that sqm systems become more stable as a increases due to the small total charge of sqm and bag model effects",
    ". for sufficiently large a ( @xmath23 to @xmath24 , depending on the parameters assumed ) , sqm might be absolutely stable @xcite . at the low - mass end",
    "jaffe @xcite proposed the existence of a neutral metastable dibaryon called the @xmath25 consisting of ( uuddss ) quarks .",
    "its lifetime was estimated @xcite to be less than @xmath26 .",
    "it has been postulated that there may exist compact astrophysical objects composed entirely of strange matter called strange stars .",
    "several astrophysical mechanisms are available to convert very large stars to strange stars as discussed by li _ _ et al.__@xcite and references therein .",
    "they also postulate that the millisecond pulsar sax j1808.4 - 3658 is a good candidate for a strange star .    for smaller a",
    ", sqm may be metastable if strong decays are forbidden , but could undergo weak decays with lifetimes in the range from @xmath27 to @xmath28 sec @xcite .",
    "effects of _ pauli blocking _ may help to increase sqm lifetimes .",
    "such systems with @xmath29 which might be produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions are commonly called _ strangelets _ and are predicted to be metastable for a wide range of sqm properties and bag model parameters @xcite . due to the lack of theoretical constraints on bag model parameters and difficulties in calculating color magnetic interactions and finite size effects @xcite experiments are necessary to help answer the question of the stability of strangelets if indeed they do exist .",
    "relativistic heavy ion collisions provide a promising mechanism for producing strangelets in the laboratory due to the high baryon densities and the large number of strange quarks achieved in a small volume during these collisions .",
    "several classes of models have been generated to describe strangelet production in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "they can be classified into two categories , namely strangelet production by coalescence or strangelet production following quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) production .    in _ coalescence models _",
    "@xcite a number of a=1 particles are produced in the collision that in turn fuse to form a strangelet .",
    "thermal models _ further assume that thermal and chemical equilibrium are achieved prior to the production of the final particles @xcite .",
    "coalescence and thermal models usually predict lower strangelet cross sections than models that postulate a collision in which a qgp state is formed .    it might be possible to produce a phase transition to a qgp in these collisions .",
    "under these conditions the hot quark matter might cool into a metastable state of cold sqm resulting in a strangelet .",
    "models have been produced to examine production of strangelets following qgp formation .",
    "_ estimate that at ags energies there could be rare events in which a droplet of qgp is nucleated converting most of the superheated matter to plasma @xcite .",
    "they calculate the probability that thermal fluctations in a superheated hadronic gas will produce a thermal droplet and that the droplet will be large enough to overcome its surface free energy and grow .",
    "they estimate this to occur in between 0.1% and 1% of central ( small impact parameter ) @xmath0 + @xmath0 collisions at ags energies .",
    "greiner _ et al .",
    "_ suggests that once a qgp droplet is formed , for a wide range of qgp properties , almost every qgp state evolves into a strangelet by means of the strangeness distillation mechanism providing strangelets are metastable @xcite .",
    "the droplet cools by emitting mesons but the @xmath30 quarks preferentially joins with u and d quarks to form k mesons in the baryon rich plasma formed at ags energies .",
    "this leaves the qgp enriched in strangeness relative to anti - strangeness leading to the formation of a strangelet during the hadronization process .",
    "this process favors the formation of the more stable large strangelets since the qgp would lose energy by meson emission possibly resulting in a strangelet of approximately the same a as the qgp droplet .",
    "it is thus important to carry out experiments that are sensitive to a large mass range .",
    "other estimates of strangelet production by distillation from the qgp were carried out by liu and shaw @xcite and crawford @xcite .",
    "they predict a wide range of production levels .",
    "strangelet production could prehaps be as high as @xmath27 to @xmath31 per central @xmath32 collision at ags energies .",
    "based on a recent calculation , schaffner - bielich _ et al .",
    "_ have suggested that at low masses negative strangelets are more likely to be formed than positive strangelets @xcite .",
    "they used the mit bag model with shell mode filling for various bag parameters .",
    "their model also predicts a number of neutral strangelet states to be metastable .    in this experiment",
    "we have searched for positive , negative and neutral strangelets with masses up to a=100 .",
    "we note that our apparatus would detect strangelets of @xmath33 if they were produced .",
    "however , the production probability with coalescence would certainly vanish at baryon numbers of the order of 100 or more .",
    "the strangeness distillation model would produce strangelets which at the extreme would be less than the total numner of baryons in the collision ( 197 + 208 for a @xmath34 collision ) .",
    "furthermore , due to saturation in the response of the e864 calorimeter , all masses higher than a=100 would be detected as having mass very close to a=100 .",
    "for these reasons we show our yields as functions of a up to a=100 .",
    "searches for in situ sqm have been made on terrestrial matter @xcite , cosmic rays and astrophysical objects @xcite .",
    "these searches resulted in extremely low limits for strangelets in terrestrial matter .",
    "these rates are less than predicted by big bang models of strangelet production in the early universe and so would argue against the existence of completely stable strangelets .",
    "this conclusion , however , is somewhat ambiguous due to the uncertainties in the models themselves , the uncertainty in estimating strangelet survival probabilities and possible geophysical processes which could `` distill '' the terrestrial strangelets into unaccessible regions .    with the advent of relativistic heavy ion beams at the ags and sps accelerators it is possible to search for metastable strangelets in the reaction products from central collisions where a large number of strange quarks are produced .",
    "searches for strangelets have been carried out using relativistic heavy ion beams from the ags and sps accelerators .",
    "early searches which used @xmath35 + @xmath36 @xcite and @xmath35 + @xmath0 @xcite reactions at the ags accelerator and @xmath37 + @xmath38 @xcite reactions at the sps accelerator yielded null results .",
    "later experiments at the ags accelerator using @xmath0 beams @xcite and at the sps accelerator using @xmath2 beams @xcite also yielded null results despite the increased production potential of these heavier beams . to date",
    "no experiment has published results indicating a clear positive signal for strangelets so all have set production upper limits .",
    "the searches for strangelets discussed above using relativistic heavy ion collisions were sensitive to proper lifetimes down to about 50 ns .",
    "all of these experiments except the one carried out by e814 @xcite used focusing spectrometers which , for a given magnetic field setting , have good acceptance only for a fixed momentum and charge of the produced particle .",
    "therefore , the production limits obtained in these experiments are strongly dependent upon the production model assumed for high mass particles such as strangelets .",
    "recent searches for the @xmath25 dibaryon have been carried out .",
    "if the @xmath25 decays weakly by @xmath39 then the expected lifetime is similar to that of the @xmath40 , therefore most searches look for decay processes with @xmath40 type lifetimes .",
    "however , if the @xmath25 is very tightly bound , then only @xmath41 decays are allowed and a resulting lifetime of the order of 50 ns is possible . using the 1.8 gev / c @xmath42 beam from the ags , stotzer _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite in e836 searched for the @xmath25 at a mass range from 50 to 380 mev/@xmath43 below the @xmath44 threshold . e810 and",
    "e888 have also carried out searches for the @xmath6 dibaryon@xcite at the ags by searching for it s decay modes but conclusive evidence for it s existence has not been obtained . the neutral beam produced by 800 gev / c protons on a @xmath45 target",
    "was analyzed by the fermilab ktev collaboration@xcite to search for the @xmath25 .",
    "no events consistent with interpretation as an @xmath25 were observed .",
    "a complete summary of searches carried out for various forms of strange quark matter is given in a review article by klingenberg @xcite .",
    "the primary goal of the e864 experiment was to search for charged and neutral strangelets with lifetimes @xmath46 seconds , baryon number a from 6 up to 100 and charge to mass ratios lower than most normal nuclei .",
    "these characteristics suggested a strategy of looking for mid - rapidity , massive objects with an unusual z / a ratio in an apparatus with a high rate capability and redundancy for background rejection .",
    "the e864 apparatus implemented this strategy as described in the next section .",
    "e864 results from earlier data sets with smaller statistics than the results shown here have been published for charged strangelets in a series of papers by armstrong _",
    "_ @xcite as well as for neutral strangelets @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give the final limits for both charged and neutral strangelets from the e864 experiment .",
    "the e864 experiment is an open geometry , two dipole magnetic spectrometer designed to search for strangelets in @xmath0 + @xmath47 collisions at 11.5 gev / c per nucleon .",
    "the experiment is described in detail in ref  @xcite .",
    "the open geometry with only dipole magnets causes the experiment to be less sensitive to the shape of a particle s production differential cross section .",
    "due to the nature of the design of the rare particle search , the spectrometer is also well suited for detecting nuclear isotopes and hypernuclei produced by coalescence following central collisions .",
    "the spectrometer identifies particles via their mass m and charge z. in order to conduct this search , e864 has a large geometric acceptance ( 5 msr ) and operates at a high data rate .",
    "the emphasis is on the measurement of particles near the center - of - mass rapidity since it leads to an efficient search with minimal production model dependence .",
    "a diagram of the spectrometer is shown in figure [ fig : e864 ] .",
    "the main components are beam defining counters , a target system ( usually @xmath2 or @xmath1 ) , a multiplicity counter for triggering on the centrality of the event , two analysis dipole magnets , three stations of hodoscopes for time - of - flight ( tof ) and tracking , two stations of straw tubes for tracking , a hadronic calorimeter and a large vacuum tank not shown in this figure .",
    "the experiment also utilizes a high speed data acquisition system ( 2.7 mbytes per second ) and a flexible second level trigger ( late energy trigger ) based on tof and energy as measured by the calorimeter .",
    "the e864 spectrometer receives a fully stripped @xmath0 beam with a momentum of 11.5 gev / c per nucleon .",
    "the ions are incident on a @xmath2 or @xmath1 target of thickness between 5% and 60% of a @xmath0 interaction length .",
    "the nucleon - nucleon center of mass energy is 4.6 gev and its rapidity @xmath48 is 1.6 .",
    "the experimental layout in the target area consists of quartz cherenkov beam counters ( mitch ) and beam defining counters and a scintillator multiplicity counter to select events with the desired centrality .",
    "thin quartz plates are used for all counters traversed by the beam to minimize the number of interactions in the counters .",
    "the beam counters measure the incident beam flux and provide the start time for the hodoscope and calorimeter tdcs @xcite .",
    "the multiplicity counter consists of a four quadrant annulus placed around the beam pipe 13 cm downstream of the target .",
    "it subtends an angular range of @xmath49 to @xmath50 .",
    "the total signal measured with this counter is proportional to the centrality of the collision and is used to trigger on the centrality of the events .",
    "most data is taken with a threshold to accept the 10% of events with the largest multiplicity counter signals .",
    "the heart of the spectrometer tracking is the scintillator tof hodoscope system which consists of three stations , h1 , h2 and h3 , whose locations are shown in figure [ fig : e864 ] .",
    "the hodoscopes provide redundant measurements of a particle s tof as well as its position . requiring that a good space track also have consistent velocities as measured at each of the hodoscopes",
    "significantly improves the background rejection .",
    "the hodoscopes also give three independent charge measurements via the pulse height information from energy loss ( @xmath51 ) in the scintillator .",
    "the hodoscopes provide @xmath52 space points .",
    "the time resolution for h1 and h2 is @xmath53 ps and for h3 is @xmath54 ps .",
    "the measured efficiencies of the hodoscopes range from 97.7% for h1 to 98.9% for h2 and h3 .    in order to improve the spatial resolution for tracked particles ,",
    "the spectrometer has two stations of straw tubes , referred to as s2 and s3 in figure  [ fig : e864 ] . a complete description can be found in reference@xcite .",
    "each station consists of three sub - planes ( @xmath55 ) each consisting of two layers .",
    "the straws of the x plane are mounted vertically and the straws of the u and v planes are mounted at @xmath5620@xmath57 relative to vertical , respectively .",
    "each sub - plane consists of two staggered layers of straw tubes 4 mm in diameter .",
    "the planes are rotated around the vertical axis at approximately 6 degrees with respect to the beam line so that most particles are incident perpendicular to the planes .",
    "a straw tube chamber s1 was placed inside the vacuum tank between m1 and m2 .",
    "the chamber was designed to improve the tracking by providing a track measurement between the magnets . however , due to a problem with discharges associated with the high voltage connections , the chamber did not work well enough to be useful . due to the exigencies of the experimental run ,",
    "the chamber was left in place and contributed to background scattering processes .",
    "the analysis which we carried out is correct but would have given a slightly more sensitive result if s1 had been removed .",
    "the final element of the spectrometer is a `` spaghetti '' design hadronic calorimeter located at the end of the e864 beamline as shown in figure  [ fig : e864 ] .",
    "its purpose is to provide a second independent mass measurement for charged particles and to identify neutral particles based on @xmath58 and the deposited energy .",
    "the tower construction is based on a design first tested by the spacal collaboration@xcite .",
    "the spaghetti design allows a close packed geometry and virtually eliminates gaps or dead regions in the detector fiducial volume .",
    "this results in very good energy and time resolution .",
    "in addition , the detector response is quite uniform and nearly independent of the position of the particle .",
    "details of the construction and performance of the calorimeter have been published@xcite .",
    "the calorimeter consists of @xmath59 towers .",
    "the whole assembly is rotated @xmath60 with respect to the beam direction .",
    "the dimensions of each tower is @xmath61 .",
    "the tower width is smaller than the typical transverse size of a hadronic shower thus allowing for transverse shower profile information .",
    "the time and energy resolution of the calorimeter are excellent .",
    "the resolution for showers in a @xmath62 array is given by    @xmath63    and the hadronic time resolution is better than 400 psec .",
    "the data acquisition system ( daq ) is designed to record 4000 events per ags spill and typically 1800 events per spill are recorded .",
    "signals from the counters and triggers are sent into digitizers in fastbus or camac .",
    "event data are sent to memory buffers residing in vme which are capable of buffering an entire spill s worth of data .",
    "the event fragments in each buffer are assembled in event builder modules and transferred to eight exabyte 8 mm tape drives .",
    "more details and specifications are given in @xcite .",
    "the first level of the e864 two - level trigger selects events where a good beam particle had the desired centrality .",
    "the second level selects events based on time and energy measurements in the calorimeter and is called the late energy trigger ( let ) .",
    "the level 1 trigger requires that the beam counter signal is consistent with a single au ion with no hits in either of the veto counters and that no beam particle is within a time window before and after the selected hit . the trigger could also be set to exclude events below a given multiplicity .    the level 1 trigger provides sufficient rejection to study inclusive spectra of protons and kaons but a level 2 trigger is needed to obtain the sensitivity required for the strangelet searches . since the calorimeter measures both energy and time in each tower , that information is used to determine the mass of the particle .",
    "as an example figure  [ fig : let_perfect ] shows a simulation of the distribution in tof versus energy for mass 6 uncharged strangelets compared to that for protons and neutrons with a curve to illustrate a typical cut with the effects of detector resolution included in the simulation . the implementation of the let is described in detail in reference  @xcite .",
    "the let system digitizes the energy and time signals from the calorimeter providing indices into a programmable lookup table .",
    "the output of the lookup tables is ored to form an accept or reject .",
    "the lookup table is generated in terms of energy and tof from monte carlo and data .",
    "a typical trigger table efficiency is 85% for a mass 5 gev/@xmath43 , charge + 1 strangelet in the rapidity range @xmath64 at the + 1.5 t field setting and increasing to almost 100% for higher masses .",
    "the corresponding rejection factor for the above example is 80 , giving enhancements ( defined as rejection times efficiency ) of about 68 .",
    "extensive use of a geant3@xcite based monte carlo of the apparatus was made both in designing the shielding and detector as well as determining acceptances and efficiencies for the physics results . in the analysis stage ,",
    "acceptances and efficiencies are obtained by tracking single particles with various production models through the geant3 model .",
    "the acceptance of the spectrometer for neutral particles is determined by the physical apertures of the collimators and magnets .",
    "for charged particles with momentum @xmath65 and transverse momentum @xmath66 , the acceptance in rigidity r=@xmath65/z and transverse rigidity @xmath67=@xmath66/z is constrained by the field of the magnets as well as these apertures . for high positive fields",
    "the pions and protons are largely swept out of the spectrometer acceptance .",
    "this is a desirable feature when searching for rare high mass objects such as strangelets .",
    "there are regions in @xmath48 and @xmath66 with acceptance for the same particle species in different field settings .",
    "this provides an important check on the systematics . in figure",
    "[ fig : he-6 ] the acceptance is shown for a heavy species , namely @xmath68 , as a function of transverse rigidity and rapidity at a magnetic field of 1.5 t.",
    "the reconstruction of charged particle tracks uses information from the hodoscopes and the straw tubes .",
    "the tracking algorithm begins by using the three - dimensional space hits in the hodoscopes to define straight line tracks downstream of the magnets in the @xmath69 and @xmath70 planes .",
    "consistent hits in the straw tubes are then attached to the track and the tracks are refit . next",
    "the rigidities ( @xmath65/z ) and path lengths of the tracks are determined from a lookup table whose inputs are the @xmath69 and @xmath70 slopes of the tracks downstream which are assumed to come from the target .",
    "the lookup table is determined from a monte carlo simulation of the apparatus which includes a model of the magnetic fields .",
    "the table is only a few thousand entries in length due to a sophisticated multi - dimensional interpolation@xcite .",
    "the method is very fast and has an intrinsic resolution of better than 0.1% .",
    "next the path length versus tof at the target and each of the hodoscopes is fit to determine the velocity of the tracked particle .",
    "using the rigidity and the velocity , the track is refit using a full multiple scattering correlation matrix .",
    "the complete formalism is given in appendix a of ref  @xcite .",
    "there are four fits : @xmath69 , @xmath70 , time vs pathlength and @xmath48-pathlength .",
    "the track quality is evaluated by considering the chi - squareds of these fits .",
    "tracks with a large chi - squared have a high probability of being associated with background processes .",
    "each of the x , u and v straw tube planes consists of two layers . in track reconstruction ,",
    "each set of 2 layers is considered as one logical plane called a doublet .",
    "the hits are combined into clusters which are groups of contiguous hits in the doublet .",
    "thus most clusters consist of two hits , one from each plane .",
    "the efficiency of each plane is measured by leaving the plane of interest out of the track fits and then checking if there is a hit in that plane consistent with the track .",
    "the doublet efficiency , defined as the efficiency for having at least one hit in the doublet , is typically 95%-98% .",
    "one of the most important aspects of the spectrometer is its ability to track particles in time as well as in space .",
    "the arrival time of a charged particle relative to the arrival of the beam particle at the target is determined independently in the three hodoscope walls as well as in the calorimeter .",
    "the time of flight for a hit in a hodoscope slat is given by    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are the raw tdc values , corrected for slewing and for differences in cable lengths and any time dependent variations in the pmts , cables and tdcs and converted to nanoseconds using the time calibration of the tdcs .",
    "@xmath74 is the mean time for the beam counter and is subtracted off event by event in order to remove variations in the experimental gate .",
    "@xmath75 is an offset which turns the number into a true time of flight .",
    "it is determined originally from mc calculations and then fine tuned using tracked particles to calculate @xmath58=v / c from the measured momentum and assumed mass of the track .",
    "note than an error in the magnetic field can be compensated for in this constant if only one particle species is considered .",
    "this is avoided by using particles of different species .",
    "the @xmath58 of a particle is determined from a least square fit of path length from the target to the hodoscope planes versus tof .",
    "the charge @xmath76 of a track is determined independently in each hodoscope wall using the the geometric mean of the measurements by the adcs at the top and bottom of the slat .",
    "the geometric mean is used because it does not depend on the vertical position of the hit in the slat . specifically ,    @xmath77    where @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 are the gain , adc value and pedestal for the top and bottom signals , respectively . the pedestals are determined from `` empty '' events taken randomly throughout the spill .",
    "the gains are normalized for every slat by using tracked particles .",
    "typical efficiencies for the cuts used to isolate charge @xmath81 particles are @xmath82 per plane , or 91% since all three planes are used .",
    "charge 2 efficiencies are somewhat lower , @xmath83 per plane or 80% total .",
    "the ability of the spectrometer to identify particles via their mass and charge is demonstrated in figure  [ fig : mass_charge ] from the the 1995 data at + 1.5 t. the only cuts that are applied are chi - squared cuts on the tracks and @xmath84 .",
    "note that this data is taken with the let set to enhance higher mass particles .",
    "the various species are well separated and there is little background .",
    "the single particle mass spectra at the 1.5 t field setting is shown in figures [ fig : mass_15 ] and [ fig : zxb2 ] for charge + 1 and + 2 particles , respectively .",
    "the mass resolutions are on the order of 3 - 5% and the peaks are very clean with minimal background .",
    "also the same species are accepted , although with different efficiencies , in more than one field setting .",
    "requiring that results agree from one field setting to the next provides an important check of systematics , particularly for invariant cross sections as a function of rapidity and @xmath66 . in figure",
    "[ fig : zxb2 ] peaks from @xmath85 and @xmath68 are clearly seen .",
    "figure [ fig : zxb2 ] also demonstrates the benefit of calorimeter cuts in eliminating charged particle background generated by charge exchange scattering of neutrons .",
    "the mass is given by    @xmath86    where r is the particles rigidity .",
    "the mass resolution is dependent on the resolution of both @xmath58 ( from tof ) and momentum .",
    "the momentum resolution is given by    @xmath87    where @xmath88 is the magnetic field and @xmath89 is the angle of the track in the bend plane as measured by the downstream tracking chambers .",
    "the magnetic fields are known to @xmath90 .",
    "the resolution in @xmath89 is determined by the multiple scattering ( proportional to @xmath91 ) and the resolution of the straw tubes .",
    "@xmath89 itself is proportional to the total field times @xmath92 .",
    "figure  [ fig : p_res ] demonstrates these effects .",
    "it gives the momentum resolution @xmath93 as a function of momentum @xmath65 for 0.2 t and 1.5 t fields for a charge 1 particle .",
    "the open symbols are the distributions when multiple scattering is turned off in the simulation .      the principal backgrounds in e864 are expected to be those which produce real tracks with the same directions and velocities as the tracks of interest .",
    "sources of such tracks are :    1 .   overlapping events caused by two beam particles within the event time window of the detector , @xmath9450 ns . both interact in the target or the later one interacts upstream of the target .",
    "the timing is set by the first one , so tracks from the second interaction will be late , leading to an incorrect @xmath58 that is too small .",
    "charged tracks that originate downstream of the target , many of which are created in interactions by neutrons generated in the target .",
    "the track will be properly reconstructed downstream of the magnets , but when the track is extrapolated back to the target , the momentum will be larger than it should be .",
    "sources of such tracks are secondary interactions the most troublesome of which are charge exchange of neutrons into protons in the vacuum chamber exit window just downstream of m2 , in the air before s2 or in the first mono - layer of s2 .",
    "an additional source of background was scattering of particles by the s1 straw tube array .    the first class of backgrounds is minimized with veto counters and the detection of multiple beam tracks in the trigger counters .",
    "the second class of background is minimized by requiring that the momentum as measured by the tracking chambers agree with the energy as measured in the calorimeter .",
    "we report here the results of a search for neutral strangelets in relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "the first information available on neutral strangelet limits was published@xcite based on an earlier e864 data set with smaller statistics .",
    "background problems associated with searches for neutral particles are more severe .",
    "in addition to all the background associated with charged particle searches , backgrounds are present due to the inability to track neutral particles .",
    "the search for neutral strangelets capitalizes on the excellent performance of the e864 spectrometer for the study of both charged and neutral hadrons .",
    "the key element making the search for neutral strangelets possible is the hadronic calorimeter at the downstream end of the e864 tracking system .",
    "the search for neutral strangelets is performed in three steps .",
    "the first step is to search for interesting hits in the calorimeter .",
    "the second step is to eliminate all hits corresponding to charged particles reaching the calorimeter .",
    "the final step is to eliminate clusters with energy contamination from overlapping showers or products from late interactions in the target . in the first step the entire fiducial volume for the hadronic calorimeter",
    "is searched for each event to identify particle hits that could represent an interesting object .",
    "hits that represent a local maximum in energy and that also fired the let are selected for further analysis .",

    "as an example , taking the production of @xmath68 as @xmath185 per 10% most central collision , the probability for producing a strangelet with a=7 , z=2 and s=-1 is @xmath192 , which is below our limit for such strangelets .",
    "these results indicate that if such strangelets are formed by coalescence then a search with a sensitivity of at least a factor of 10 greater than in this experiment will be needed .",
    "if even larger strangelets are formed by coalescence , we ll need even a greater increase in the sensitivity .",
    "the e864 spectrometer is used to sample approximately 27 billion 10% most central @xmath0 + @xmath1 interactions at the ags in a search for charged strange quark matter . in addition 14.75 billion",
    "10% most central @xmath0 + @xmath1 interactions are sampled in a search for neutral strangelets .",
    "redundant tracking methods and calorimetry are used to reduce background .",
    "no consistent candidates for new states of strange quark matter are found with proper lifetime greater than approximately 50 ns .",
    "the search results in the assignment of 90% c.l .",
    "upper limits of typically @xmath5 or less for 10% most central collisions of @xmath0 + @xmath1 for charged strangelet searches over a mass range from a = 6 to 100 .",
    "we also report here limits on the production of neutral strangelets .",
    "the 90% c.l .",
    "upper limit is @xmath193 for @xmath194 and increases to @xmath156 for a=10 . coalescence studies of light nuclei indicate a coalescence penalty factor of about 48 for the addition of each nucleon .",
    "an additional penalty factor may exist for replacement of a non - strange by a strange quark .",
    "this is being investigated by studying the yield of the @xmath195 in the e864 experiment and the result will be reported in a forthcoming publication .",
    "although we are able to set very low upper limits on the existence of strangelets in the range of sensitivity of our experiment we are not able to answer the question concerning their existence .",
    "there are several definite reasons for this .",
    "first the experiment is only sensitive to strangelets with proper lifetimes greater than about 50 ns .",
    "also the penalty factor for addition of a nucleon to a fragment is found to be about 48 as shown in our results on the production of light nuclei from coalescence@xcite which is much higher than expected .",
    "the experiment is not sensitive enough to detect @xmath123 , therefore detection of coalescence - produced strangelets with @xmath189 would not be expected .",
    "it did rule out the formation of a qgp followed by the formation of a strangelet at levels of typically @xmath5 per 10% most central collision .",
    "these studies represent the most extensive and highest sensitivity heavy ion based searches at ags energies for sqm to date . in addition high efficiency searches at the cern - sps by na52 @xcite found no evidence for sqm .",
    "we conclude from these studies that if strangelets exist and can be produced in relativistic heavy ion collisions , experiments with very much higher statistics will be needed in order to detect them .",
    "nevertheless , if the qgp can be made this might produce additional pathways for strangelet production .",
