    "cosmic shear has long been recognised as a potentially very powerful tool for determining the properties of the universe .",
    "its sensitivity to cosmological parameters and its clean dependence via gravity on the mass distribution make it an attractive option for determining , amongst other things , the properties of dark energy , and it also opens up the prospect of testing beyond - einstein gravity models . for recent reviews and summaries ,",
    "see @xcite . with the advent of very large surveys directed towards large - scale weak lensing effects , such as pan - starrs1 , the dark energy survey , and in the future , lsst , euclid and wfirst ,",
    "focus has shifted towards the systematic errors rather than the raw statistical power of weak lensing . for cosmic shear",
    ", there are challenges related to the precise measurement of galaxy shapes ( e.g. @xcite ) , and physical effects such as intrinsic alignments ( e.g. @xcite ) which can mimic to some degree the effects of weak lensing",
    ". these effects will increase the errors on recovered parameters , so it is timely to investigate magnification ( or amplification ) - another feature of weak gravitational lensing , which , although not as statistically powerful as cosmic shear , provides independent cosmological information .",
    "given that the effects of changing dark energy properties and changing the gravity law are rather subtle , it is highly desirable to have independent techniques which are not subject to the same systematic errors .",
    "weak lensing induces small changes to object sizes , which , through the conservation of surface brightness , leads to flux changes which alter the number density of galaxies when a flux limited survey is considered . as a result of this amplification , in concert with the changes in positions , the clustering pattern of galaxies is altered . in regions where there is magnification ( as opposed to de - magnification ) , the number density is increased or decreased depending on the slope of the number counts , as it depends on how many sources are promoted into the survey by the lensing , and @xcite has shown how magnification and shear can be used together to help cosmological parameter estimation .",
    "recent studies @xcite have demonstrated the magnification effect with cosmological surveys , and @xcite have shown how flux information may be used to isolate lensing magnification .",
    "the main complication which has to be dealt with is that there is a strong intrinsic clustering of galaxies , which contaminates the clustering signal due to weak lensing .",
    "indeed , to call it a contaminant is a misnomer , as it is much stronger than the lensing signal .",
    "the intrinsic clustering of galaxies is not as easy to model theoretically as the lensing signal , as the former depends on galaxy formation efficiency ( normally distilled into _ galaxy bias _ ) , whereas the lensing signal depends only on the matter distribution .",
    "one approach is to model the entire clustering system , including lensing and bias , and this has been the approach of @xcite .",
    "however , since the main advantage of lensing is its independence ( at least in its dominant effect ) on complex astrophysics which may be difficult to determine with precision , it is appealing to consider an alternate strategy , where one removes the intrinsic clustering part of the signal , leaving , ideally , the pure lensing signal .",
    "if this can be achieved , then confrontation with theory becomes much more straightforward and robust .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate to what extent this can be achieved , using a ` nulling ' technique similar to that which has been proposed to deal with intrinsic alignments in cosmic shear .",
    "nulling can be achieved because we know ( for a given cosmology ) how the source of the magnification signal depends on redshift , and we can exploit this to find combinations of correlations which do not include intrinsic clustering terms .",
    "the problems of dealing with intrinsic alignments in cosmic shear and intrinsic clustering in cosmic magnification are in some respects similar , but in others different . in both cases the observable quantity ( the ellipticity in the case of shear , the number density in the case of magnification ) depends to first order on the addition of two components , so any quadratic quantities such as the correlation function or power spectrum of the observables have four terms .",
    "the main differences are that in the cosmic shear case , the contaminants are relatively small , but poorly - known theoretically , whereas in the magnification case , the contaminating terms are large , but in principle measurable .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in section [ theory ]",
    "we review the theory of cosmic magnification . in section 3",
    "we develop the nulling theory , and in section 4 we present results , with conclusions given in section 5 .",
    "the distortion of light bundles leads to a mapping from the source plane to the image plane which is described by a symmetric amplification matrix which is decomposed into a convergence @xmath0 , and two shear terms @xmath1 and @xmath2 , which describe distortions along the coordinate axes and at @xmath3 respectively : @xmath4 size changes ( and hence flux changes , by liouville s theorem ) are related to the inverse of the jacobian of the transformation , which to linear order is @xmath5 this is the magnification or amplification .",
    "let the unmagnified average number density at position @xmath6 above a flux limit @xmath7 be @xmath8 , and we assume that near the flux limit of a survey it has a slope @xmath9 , i.e. @xmath10 then the expected observed galaxy counts , neglecting intrinsic clustering , for given magnification @xmath11 will be @xmath12 the solid angle elements are also magnified , thus lowering the number density and resulting in the @xmath13 factor @xcite .",
    "note that the slope may be dependent on @xmath6 ( only via @xmath14 if the survey selection is isotropic within the observed area ) , and that the power - law need not extend over a wide range of @xmath7 ; it is the local slope at the flux limit which is required .",
    "if we include intrinsic clustering of the sources , characterised by a fractional overdensity @xmath15 , then the observed number density of galaxies at position @xmath6 is given by ( dropping the @xmath16 ) @xmath17\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the intrinsic fractional overdensity of galaxies .",
    "if we define @xmath18 as the bias parameter , here in real space , so @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the fractional mass overdensity , then linearising gives @xmath21,\\ ] ] where @xmath22 may be a function of @xmath23 , as may @xmath18 , through time - evolution .",
    "@xmath24 should be relatively easy to measure from sufficiently deep photometric catalogues , so we initially regard it as fixed and known .",
    "the convergence is @xmath25 where @xmath26 $ ] for a flat universe ( for @xmath27 , 0 otherwise ) , and @xmath28 .",
    "we will assume flatness , but this can be easily generalised .",
    "thus since @xmath0 is linear in @xmath20 , we have to linear order that the fractional number overdensity @xmath29 is : @xmath30 let us consider the two - point statistics of @xmath31 , for a tomographic survey divided into @xmath32 shells in estimated redshift ( normally coming from photometric redshift estimates ) .",
    "we will frame this discussion in real space , but will switch to fourier space in section [ nulling ] .",
    "the two - point cross - correlation function of the number overdensity in two shells @xmath33 and @xmath34 is ( with obvious notation ) @xmath35 if we wish to have a clean cosmological test , then it is the first term which is of most interest , as it does not contain galaxy bias , which is not precisely known . if we are to use it , then we need to remove or model the other terms . in this paper",
    "we choose the former strategy , which can be achieved by nulling out the remaining terms .",
    "this is very similar to what has been proposed by @xcite and @xcite for removal of intrinsic alignment ( ia ) terms in cosmic shear , where the second term is analogous to the so - called ii term , and the cross - terms are gi terms in cosmic shear ( and only one survives in that case ) .",
    "we turn to how to do this in the next section .",
    "there are two main differences between magnification nulling and ia .",
    "one is the magnitude of the effect .",
    "gi is generally subdominant to the desired gg shear signal , whereas here the @xmath36 terms far exceed the bias - independent @xmath37 term .",
    "see the top panels of fig .",
    "the other difference is that we have rather poor theoretical understanding of the gi term , whereas we can in principle make some measurements of bias of galaxies .",
    "as with the shear nulling method of joachimi & schneider ( 2008 ) , we cross - correlate the overdensity of galaxies in a tomographic bin labelled by @xmath33 with a weighted average of the overdensities in all other tomographic bins . writing this average as @xmath38 in the continuum limit , where @xmath39 is an angular position on the sky , @xmath40",
    "if we choose @xmath41 to be zero for @xmath23 close to @xmath42 ( the centre of the tomographic bin @xmath33 ) , then the intrinsic clustering term ( a product of @xmath43 terms ) will be small .",
    "this is analogous to the downweighting @xcite or removal of @xcite close pairs to remove the ii term in cosmic shear .",
    "we also want to zero out the cross terms ( @xmath44 terms ) .",
    "one cross term is @xmath45 and we choose @xmath46 such that this is zero . reversing the integration order ( and dividing by @xmath47 ) , @xmath48 where @xmath49 if we choose @xmath50 on scales where the density correlations are significant ( i.e. at @xmath51 ) , then the expectation value of equation @xmath52 will be nearly zero . with @xmath42 at the median redshift of the bin , we choose @xmath53 since @xmath54 is influenced only by @xmath55 , we null the other cross term by simply requiring @xmath56 there are many weight vectors which will satisfy this equation , so for maximum statistical power , we follow @xcite and include all orthogonal weight vectors which satisfy the constraint . indeed the weights are identical to the intrinsic alignment case if the slope of the number counts does not vary with redshift , but is modified if it does . for the details of how this is done ,",
    "the reader is directed to @xcite .",
    "note that the weights require the choice of a fiducial cosmology , and the weights must not be changed as a search of parameter space is undertaken .",
    "clearly , if the choice is very poor , the nulling will be suboptimal , but there would be no difficulty in iterating the process , where the best - fit cosmology is used to define optimal nulling weights , and the process repeated . in this paper , we assume the correct cosmology for the weights , for simplicity .    to compute the weighted cross - power spectrum , we note that we are cross - correlating two fields @xmath57\\qquad s>0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the first term averages the overdensity over the shell . in the second term , we allow for a variety of weighting functions @xmath58 , as there are @xmath59 orthogonal weighting functions which satisfy the constraint equation [ constraint ]",
    ".    we can write these in the form @xmath60 where @xmath61 where @xmath62 is roughly a top - hat of unit area centred on the bin centre @xmath42 .",
    "this can be refined to reflect the averaging over the bin width with a varying number density .",
    "for such fields , the limber approximation ( e.g. @xcite , section 2.84 ) gives the cross - power spectrum as @xmath63 where the last argument of the matter power spectrum @xmath64 indicates its time - dependence .",
    "the sensitivity to cosmological parameters comes from the matter power spectrum and its evolution with time , and the distance - redshift relation @xmath65 where @xmath66^{1/2}$ ] if the dark energy has present density parameter @xmath67 . @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the present matter and total density contributions , and we ignore radiation .",
    "note that later we allow the dark energy density to evolve , so this equation is modified in the standard way .    for this initial study",
    ", we compute the covariance of power spectrum estimates assuming gaussian statistics , but note that this would need to be estimated from numerical simulations ( e.g. @xcite ) for real applications , and would include non - zero cross terms .",
    "the covariance of powers averaged in bins of width @xmath70 is @xmath71 where @xmath72 is the solid angle of the survey , and @xmath73 is a function of the bins @xmath33 and @xmath34 . for @xmath74",
    "the covariance is zero if we assume all - sky coverage . for practical cases we use the usual scaling with the sky fraction @xmath75",
    "if , as is the case here , most of the signal comes from relatively small scales .    finally , we compute the fisher matrix @xcite for the cosmological parameters @xmath76 : @xmath77 and the summation convention is assumed for @xmath78 , which are indices which run over all the @xmath79 modes .",
    "the fisher matrix also allows us to compute analytically the parameter biases arising from incorrect parametrisation of the data , assuming a gaussian likelihood surface ( see e.g. @xcite ) : @xmath80_{\\alpha\\gamma}^{-1}(f_{\\theta\\psi})_{\\gamma\\beta}\\delta\\psi_\\beta\\ ] ] where @xmath81 is the error made in the fixed model parameter @xmath82 , and @xmath83 is a pseudo - fisher matrix of the same form as equation [ fisher ] , but with one @xmath84 replaced by @xmath85 .",
    "the situation which we investigate is as follows .",
    "the galaxy bias is scale - independent , but redshift - dependent : @xmath86 with @xmath87 and @xmath88 . for the analysis , we incorrectly model the bias as a constant , independent of @xmath89 , and treat it as a parameter in the modelling , with a gaussian prior of width 0.1 , centred on unity .",
    "we also have 6 cosmological parameters ( scalar spectral index , density parameter in matter and baryons , dark energy equation of state parameter @xmath90 , fluctuation amplitude and hubble parameter , with fiducial values @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , @xmath94 , @xmath95 , @xmath96 .",
    "we take a number count slope @xmath97 , independent of redshift .",
    "note that this is a simplification to illustrate the method ; in practice @xmath98 depends strongly on magnitude limits and redshift .",
    "see , for example , the discussion in appendix c of @xcite .    for the survey",
    ", we assume a euclid - like basic survey design of 20,000 square degrees , but initially we will ignore photometric redshift errors for illustration .",
    "we assume 35 galaxies per square arcminute , with a redshift distribution @xmath99 $ ] , and a median redshift of 0.9 .",
    "the distribution is truncated at @xmath100 , and 20 redshift bins are used , chosen such that the number in each bin is constant , with 50 angular power spectra computed on a logarithmic grid between @xmath101 and @xmath102 . in all cases , the auto - power spectra are not considered , to suppress the @xmath103 term .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : nullexample ] we show in the lower panels the effect of nulling on the cross - power spectra .",
    "we see that if we have excellent redshifts for the galaxies , then the intrinsic clustering term @xmath104 can be nulled out very effectively , reducing its relative amplitude by nearly two orders of magnitude so that it is well below the @xmath105 term ( here we use a compact notation , meaning the cross - power of the @xmath0 component of the overdensity in bin @xmath33 with the relevant component of one of the weightings @xmath106 associated with that bin ) .",
    "the nulling is not perfect , because of the finite width of the bins : the nulling works at the median redshift of the bin , but is not perfect away from the bin centre .",
    "we see that we can reduce the contamination to a level generally below the @xmath105 term , but it is still non - negligible .",
    "this figure suggests that some modelling of the bias is still needed , however the accuracy required is reduced .",
    "the two general approaches we can take are to model the data , including a bias model , or to attempt to null out the terms depending on bias , and to model the remaining terms , which depend only rather cleanly on cosmological parameters . our results of the effectiveness of nulling indicate that the latter approach is too ambitious , as the residual @xmath36 signal is not small enough to be ignored , and it must be modelled .",
    "having said this , its sensitivity to bias is much smaller than without nulling , so there are some advantages to this approach .",
    "what we show in this section is that if the modelling of bias ( and its evolution ) is imperfect , then modelling the complete clustering signal can lead to large biases in cosmological parameter estimates ( in terms of the statistical error ) , whereas with nulling , the parameter biases are typically much less than the statistical errors . on the other hand ,",
    "the statistical errors with nulling may be considerably larger than in the non - nulled case , so nulling gives us a rather conservative , but robust analysis .",
    "we perform various analyses . in version 1 ( nulled ) , we perform nulling to remove the @xmath36 terms as far as possible . here",
    "we assume that the nulling is perfect , and there is no signal left except for the pure @xmath37 term .",
    "because of the finite width of the redshift bins , the nulling is not perfect , and leaves a residual @xmath36 term , which leads to some bias in the parameter estimates , some of which remain unacceptably large , and very large statistical errors .",
    "thus we conclude that even when the photometric redshifts are assumed to be known exactly , one can not ignore the residual @xmath36 contamination in the nulling , and it has to be modelled .    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : magnullresults_ph-0.03 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : stats_offset ] we see the effect of varying the zero - redshift galaxy bias , @xmath107 .",
    "the true @xmath107 is @xmath108 , where @xmath109 is the offset shown in the figure .",
    "recall that the bias is assumed to be constant , with a gaussian prior of width 0.1 centred on @xmath110 , and the true bias is @xmath111 , so the average bias for galaxies is larger than @xmath108 .",
    "hence for @xmath112 , the model finds it hard to match the average galaxy bias for the lensed galaxies , but for @xmath113 , the average bias is closer to unity , and the prior is better matched . as a consequence ,",
    "it is not surprising that the modelling leads to quite large biases in the parameter estimates for @xmath112 .                in the analysis",
    "so far , we have assumed that we know the slope of the number counts exactly . in fig .",
    "[ fig : stats_alphas ] we show how sensitive the errors , both statistical and systematic , are to errors in the number count slope .",
    "we assume there is a gaussian random scatter with width @xmath114 about the true value of @xmath98 in each redshift bin .",
    "note that these panels have one logarithmic axis .",
    "we see that if we null and assume that there is no residual @xmath36 term ( the ` naive nulling ' curves ) , then scatter around the fiducial number count slope is very serious for parameter errors , if the scatter exceeds about 0.02 . for nulling where we also model the contaminating @xmath36 term",
    ", the situation is much better , with parameter estimation after marginalisation over the galaxy bias being rather insensitive to variations of the slope . in the worst cases ,",
    "the parameter bias is of order the systematic error , and if the slope can be constrained to an error of less than 0.02 , the systematic error is subdominant for all parameters .",
    "note that the rather strange behaviour of the bias in the spectral index @xmath115 for the nulled case is due to random fluctuations from a relatively small number of trials , but it is in any case subdominant for all values of the scatter probed .",
    "observed galaxy clustering for deep surveys is determined by a combination of intrinsic clustering and changes in number density due to the magnification and amplification effects of galaxy lensing .",
    "if the lensing effect could be isolated , it could be a useful cosmological probe , as it is independent of galaxy bias , and depends rather cleanly on cosmological parameters .",
    "the difficulty is that the signal is small in comparison with the intrinsic clustering term . in this paper , we have presented a method to isolate as far as possible the part of the clustering signal which is due to cosmic magnification .",
    "this involves exploiting the known redshift dependence of the magnification signal to remove the cross - terms which link the magnification with foreground intrinsic clustering . by isolating the magnification term",
    ", we aim to remove the dependence of clustering on the galaxy bias , which is subject to uncertainties connected with galaxy formation efficiency , leaving a clean test of cosmology relying only on the behaviour of the matter power spectrum and distance - redshift relations , both of which are much more easily predictable theoretically than galaxy bias .",
    "this is a very challenging task , because the contamination of the clean signal by intrinsic clustering is very large , and we have been partially successful . the intrinsic clustering signal can be reduced very substantially by the ` nulling ' technique we have employed ( by a factor of about 100 ) , but not to a negligible level , so the residual contamination still has to be modelled .",
    "however , since the amplitude of the residual contamination is much smaller than the signal before nulling , we do not need to model bias as accurately . by investigating an example cosmological setup where galaxy bias has a mild evolution with redshift , and modelling it incorrectly as a constant bias , we find that full modelling of the clustering signal ( including the intrinsic clustering term ) has small statistical errors , principally because the @xmath36 term is carrying quite a lot of cosmological information , but the incorrect parametrisation of the galaxy bias leads to systematic errors in the cosmological parameters which are typically significantly larger than the statistical errors .",
    "nulling , on the other hand , reduces the sensitivity to the galaxy bias modelling , as most of the effect of galaxy bias is removed .",
    "the result is that the systematic errors in the cosmological parameter estimates are reduced to a low level , at the expense of increases in statistical errors , which in some cases are quite large .",
    "the reason for the increase in error bars is that the @xmath36 term is relatively large ( in contrast to the gi term in cosmic shear ) , and it contains cosmological information , so removing it does increase the errors .",
    "thus nulling gives a robust alternative analysis to modelling the full clustering signal , as it is less sensitive to modelling of the galaxy bias , but it is a conservative analysis . in short ,",
    "full modelling is subject to a bias of a size which we may not know , as it depends on how wrong our modelling of galaxy bias is .",
    "nulling protects us against this .",
    "however , the realistic position is not so pessimistic , as we do in principle have empirical measurements of bias available , from the auto - correlation of number counts in tomographic bins , or from the galaxy bispectrum , which may prove helpful .",
    "one interesting technical point is how we are able to improve our parameter estimation by throwing away data .",
    "we see that the weighted cross - powers are simply linear combinations of individual bin - bin cross - power , but we have simply removed one linear combination of the bin number densities .",
    "the reason is as follows .",
    "the removed combination has a very large contribution from intrinsic clustering , and is thus sensitive to how the galaxy bias is modelled .",
    "if this is done imperfectly , for example by assuming some redshift dependence which does not hold in nature , then the parameter estimation process may try to fit this combination , at the expense of a poorer fit to the nulled combinations . as a result the parameter estimation may be systematically wrong . by nulling the intrinsic signal ,",
    "the cross - power spectra have a much greater signal coming from magnification , independent of bias , so the fitting is more likely to find the correct parameters .",
    "note that if we know the bias evolution precisely , then it will always be better to model all the cross - power , as this does not lose information . in practical cases",
    ", it is an open question which method is preferred , and this will be the subject of a further paper .    the key issue for the use of magnification for cosmological parameter estimation will be the level of systematic errors , since surveys which are beginning now and which are planned for the future are large enough that it is likely that the statistical errors will become irrelevant .",
    "we have not addressed this issue in the paper , except to an extent discussing the systematic errors arising from imperfect bias modelling .",
    "evidently , zero - point magnitude errors will feed into the error budget , although recent improvements in photometry ( e.g. @xcite ) are encouraging .",
    "note that the principal effect here will be angular on the sky , so the redshift dependence of the lensing signal may help to alleviate this issue .",
    "perhaps of most concern is the photometric redshift estimation ( e.g. @xcite and references therein ) , where catastrophic outliers will correlate intrinsic clustering over large redshift separations , and mimic the magnification signal to some degree , and the nulling process itself is also sensitive to outliers ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "both of these require further study to see what requirements will be needed to be met for cosmic magnification to be a viable technique .",
