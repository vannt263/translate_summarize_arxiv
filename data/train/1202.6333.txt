    "we present an initial data release of the _ kepler_-int survey ( kis ) .",
    "this paper describes optical observations carried out on the isaac newton telescope ( int ) , covering about half of the _ kepler _ field down to @xmath4 20@xmath5 magnitude .",
    "a short description of the _ kepler _ mission and the int is given in this section of the paper .",
    "section 2 describes the int observations and data products , while section 3 explains the photometric calibration of the data using the _ kepler _ input catalog ( kic , @xcite ) . in section 4",
    ", we provide a description of the catalogue .      the _ kepler _ mission s @xcite main goal is to discover earth - size planets within the habitable zones of sun - like stars .",
    "nasa s _ kepler _ spacecraft , which was launched in march 2009 , contains a differential broadband optical ( 4,200 - 9,000@xmath8 ) ccd array with a wide field of view ( fov ) of 116 deg@xmath0 , mounted on a modified 0.95 m schmidt telescope continuously observing a region in the cygnus and lyra constellations . due to the onboard storage and telemetry bandwidth limitation , only 170,000 sources , out of the millions present within the fov ,",
    "can be observed and downloaded to earth at any given time .",
    "therefore , the targets must be selected prior to the observations .",
    "+ _ kepler _ provides uninterrupted time series photometry that is superior to any previous ground - based study .",
    "although _ kepler _ was designed for the detection of exoplanets , its high - quality light curves hold an enormous potential for other astrophysical domains such as asteroseismology @xcite , stellar activity @xcite , star spot monitoring @xcite , eclipsing and close binary systems @xcite , gyrochronology @xcite , accreting white dwarfs @xcite , the study of rr lyrae stars @xcite as well as systems showing stochastic behaviour in the variability of their fluxes @xcite . _",
    "kepler _ data has also enabled the first determination of radial velocity amplitudes of binary systems through doppler boosting @xcite .    _ kepler _ operates two types of observation modes : the short ( one minute ) and long ( 30 minutes ) cadence modes .",
    "the guest observer ( go ) program offers a yearly opportunity for the observation of 5,000 long cadence targets per quarter and 40 short cadence targets per month , through a peer - reviewed competition , which is open for all astrophysical domains .",
    "every 3 months , the _ kepler _ mission also offers the opportunity for a few dozen targets to be observed through director s discretionary time ( ddt ) proposals . finally , every quarter , the _ kepler _ asteroseismology science consortium ( kasc ) can bid for more than @xmath4 1,700 targets in order to study stellar pulsations .",
    "+ it is therefore clear that the short cadence mode slots are very limited , thus a target must be well studied from the ground in order to justify required time with _ kepler_. in order to observe candidate planet hosts , mainly g - m type main - sequence stars , the _ kepler _ team created the stellar classification project ( scp ) , with a main goal to prevent the selection of non - main - sequence stars , by providing important stellar parameters ( radius , effective temperature , apparent magnitude , etc ) of the sources in the _ kepler _ fov .",
    "a photometric study of the _ kepler _ field , mainly using @xmath9 broadband filters was produced and stored in what is known as the _ kepler _ input catalog @xcite . since the main purpose of the kic was to pre - select bright solar - like stars in order to detect earth - like planets around them , the reliable depth of this survey",
    "is @xmath10 @xmath4 16 mag and there was no need to include a filter bluer than the @xmath10-band .",
    "however , it is clear that many fainter objects within the _ kepler _ fov , which can not be selected using kic data , are of interest to non - exoplanet science such as cataclysmic variables @xcite , pulsating white dwarfs @xcite and active galactic nuclei @xcite .",
    "the go and kasc programs to date show that there is a large interest in fainter and bluer objects .",
    "in order to pre - select other , rarer types of targets such as hot , young , or active stars , white dwarfs or subdwarfs , and accreting objects , a deeper optical survey of the _ kepler _ field , including a filter bluer than @xmath10 , is required .",
    "also , the addition of an h@xmath2 filter would be useful to detect emission line objects , as well as strong h@xmath2 deficit sources such as hydrogen - rich white dwarfs .",
    "therefore , the int photometric h@xmath2 survey of the northern galactic plane ( iphas , @xcite ) and the uv - excess survey of the northern galactic plane(uvex , @xcite ) collaborations made use of their available data reduction pipeline and observation strategy to obtain a homogeneous @xmath11 and h@xmath2 catalogue of the _ kepler _ fov , down to @xmath4 20@xmath5 mag in all five filters .",
    "all magnitudes are given in the vega system @xcite .",
    "we have named this effort the kepler - int survey ( kis ) .",
    "kis should be useful not only because it can identify uv - excess objects and h@xmath2 emitters , but also because it goes much deeper than kic . even though other collaborations are also conducting optical surveys of the _ kepler _ field , such as the ubv photometric survey of the _ kepler _ field @xcite",
    ", only kis provides the critical deep @xmath12-band and h@xmath2 imaging .",
    "+      the 2.5 m isaac newton telescope ( int ) is located in the roque de los muchachos observatory on la palma .",
    "the wide field camera ( wfc ) , mounted in its prime focus , is an optical imager consisting of 4 anti - reflective - coated 2048 @xmath13 4096 pixel ccds , arranged in an l - shape .",
    "it has a pixel scale of 0.333 arcsec and a field of view of 0.29 deg@xmath0 @xcite . +",
    "four broadband filters ( @xmath11 ) and one narrowband filter ( h@xmath2 ) were used to obtain the int data .",
    "the filter characteristics are provided in table [ int - filters ] .",
    "unlike @xmath14 and @xmath15 which are sdss - like filters , the @xmath12-band is a non - standard @xmath12 filter and it is affected by the ccd detector response dropping towards its blue edge . for more information on the @xmath12 filter , see @xcite ."

    "<S> observations covering @xmath4 50 deg@xmath0 , thus about half of the field , passed our quality control thresholds and constitute this first data release . </S>",

    "<S> the initial data release catalogue containing around 6 million sources from all the good photometric fields is available for download from the kis webpage@xmath6 , as well as via mast@xmath7 . </S>"
