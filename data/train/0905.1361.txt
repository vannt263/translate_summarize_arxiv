    ", particles are released one by one from the origin  @xmath2 and perform simple symmetric discrete - time random walks .",
    "starting from the set @xmath3 , the clusters @xmath4 for @xmath5 are defined recursively by letting the @xmath6-th particle walk until it first visits a site not in @xmath7 , then adding this site to the cluster .",
    "lawler , bramson and griffeath  @xcite proved that in any dimension @xmath8 , the asymptotic shape of the cluster  @xmath7 is a @xmath9-dimensional ball .",
    "lawler  @xcite subsequently showed that the fluctuations around a ball of radius  @xmath10 are at most of order @xmath11 up to logarithmic corrections .",
    "moore and machta  @xcite found experimentally that the fluctuations appear to be at most logarithmic in  @xmath10 , but there is still no rigorous bound to match their simulations .",
    "other studies of internal dla include  @xcite .    here",
    "we investigate how the shape of an internal dla cluster depends on the law of the underlying random walk .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , small changes in the law can dramatically affect the limiting shape . consider the walk in  @xmath1 with the same law as simple random walk except on the @xmath12 and @xmath13-axes , where steps toward the origin are reflected .",
    "for example , from a site @xmath14 on the positive @xmath12-axis , the walk steps to @xmath15 with probability  @xmath16 and to each of @xmath17 with probability  @xmath18 ; see figure  [ fig : simplekernel ] .",
    "it follows from theorem  [ thm : diamondshape ] , below , that when we rescale the resulting internal dla cluster  @xmath7 to have area  @xmath19 , its asymptotic shape as @xmath20 is the diamond @xmath21    .",

    "a _ uniformly layered walk _ is a discrete - time markov chain on state space @xmath1 whose transition probabilities @xmath28 satisfy    * @xmath29 if @xmath30 ; * for all @xmath31 and all @xmath32 , there exists @xmath33 with @xmath34 ; * for all @xmath35 and all @xmath36 , @xmath37    in order to state our main results , let us now give a more precise description of the aggregation rules . set @xmath38 , and let @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) be independent uniformly layered walks with the same law , started from the origin . for @xmath5 , define the stopping times @xmath41 and the growing cluster  @xmath7 recursively by setting @xmath42 and @xmath43    now for any real number @xmath44 , let @xmath45 we call  @xmath46 the diamond of radius  @xmath10 in  @xmath1 . note that @xmath47 . for integer @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 . since  @xmath50 for @xmath51 , the volume of  @xmath52 is @xmath53 our first result says that the internal dla cluster of @xmath54  sites based on any uniformly layered walk is close to a diamond of radius  @xmath55 .",

    "is the outward - directed layered walk @xmath62 satisfying @xmath63 for all @xmath23 .",
    "there is a unique such walk satisfying condition ( u3 ) whose transition probabilities are symmetric with respect to reflection about the axes .",
    "it is defined in the first quadrant by @xmath64 and on the positive horizontal axis by @xmath65 in the other quadrants  @xmath66 is defined by reflection symmetry , and at the origin we set @xmath67 for all @xmath68 with @xmath69 .",

    "the origin @xmath2 is near the lower - left corner . ]",
    "likewise one can construct a symmetric markov kernel defining an inward directed random walk which remains uniformly distributed on diamond layers .",
    "this kernel is defined in the first quadrant by @xmath71 and on the positive horizontal axis by @xmath72 again , the definition extends to the other quadrants by reflection symmetry , and is completed by making the origin an absorbing state : @xmath73 .",
    "see figure  [ fig : dirkernels ] .",
    "we now choose a parameter @xmath74 , let @xmath75 and define the kernel @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter  @xmath77 allows us to interpolate between a fully outward directed walk at @xmath59 and a fully inward directed walk at @xmath78 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : diamondshape ] shows that the fluctuations around the limit shape are at most of order @xmath79 for the entire family of walks  @xmath80 .",
    "however , one may expect that the true size of the fluctuations depends on  @xmath77 .",
    "when @xmath77 is large , particles tend to take a longer time to leave a diamond of given radius , affording them more opportunity to fill in unoccupied sites near the boundary of the cluster .",
    "indeed , in simulations we find that the boundary becomes less ragged as @xmath77 increases ( figure  [ fig : dcloseup ] ) .",
    "our next result shows that when @xmath81 , the boundary fluctuations are at most logarithmic in  @xmath55 .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     lawler , bramson and griffeath @xcite discovered a key property of the euclidean ball that characterizes it as the limiting shape of internal dla clusters based on simple random walk in  @xmath0 : for simple random walk killed on exiting the ball , any point  @xmath82 sufficiently far from the boundary of the ball is visited more often in expectation by a walk started at the origin than by a walk started at a uniform point in the ball .",
    "uniformly layered walks have an analogous property with respect to the diamond : the green s function @xmath83 for a walk started at  @xmath13 and killed on exiting @xmath52 satisfies @xmath84 for all @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , both the walk started at @xmath2 and the walk started at a uniform point in  @xmath52 are uniformly distributed on layer @xmath86 at the time  @xmath87 when they first hit this layer , so the expected number of visits to @xmath82 after time @xmath87 is the same for both walks .",
    "the inequality comes from the fact that a walk started at the origin must hit layer @xmath86 before exiting  @xmath52 .",
    "we conclude with two questions .",
    "the first concerns uniformly layered walks started from a point other than the origin .",
    "figure  [ fig : off - center ] shows internal dla clusters for six different starting points in the first quadrant of  @xmath1 .",
    "these clusters are all contained in the first quadrant .",
    "our simulations indicate that a limiting shape exists for each starting point , and that no two starting points have the same limiting shape ; but we do not know of any explicit characterization of the shapes arising in this way",
    ".    the second question is , do there exist walks with bounded increments having uniform harmonic measure on @xmath88 spheres in  @xmath0 for @xmath89 ?",
