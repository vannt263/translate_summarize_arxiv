    "intervening qso absorption lines provide an opportunity to study the evolution of galaxies selected via their gas cross - sections , independent of their stellar luminosities , from the earliest era of galaxy formation up to the present epoch .",
    "the chance alignment of galactic gas with the line of sight to a distant qso allows the unique opportunity to study the gaseous phase of galaxies , without the biases involved in luminosity limited studies .",
    "in particular , low - ion metal lines and strong lines can be used to sample the low - ionization and neutral gas bound in galactic systems .",
    "surveys for intervening absorption systems are particularly useful , since the doublet at rest wavelengths @xmath0 allows ground based surveys to track them down to relatively low redshift @xmath22 .",
    "strong systems are good tracers of large columns of neutral hydrogen gas ( rao & turnshek 2000 ) and are useful probes of the velocity structure of the neutral gas components of galaxies , including damped ly@xmath23 ( dla ) systems .",
    "furthermore , unsaturated low - ionization metal lines associated with strong systems can be used to deduce neutral phase metal abundances ( pettini et al .",
    "1999 ; nestor et al . 2003 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "many surveys have studied the statistical properties of absorption systems .",
    "lanzetta , turnshek , & wolfe ( 1987 ) presented the first significant survey and provided the benchmark results for the statistics of absorbers at relatively high redshift ( @xmath24 ) .",
    "they found marginal evidence for evolution in the number density of absorbers , but no significant evidence for evolution of the @xmath2 rest equivalent width ( @xmath3 ) distribution , which they fit equally well with an exponential and a power law .",
    "tytler et al . ( 1987 ) and sargent , steidel , & boksenberg ( 1988 ) provided data on systems at lower redshift @xmath25 and found that the comoving number density of absorbers since , as we discuss in  3 , the @xmath26 and @xmath3 dependencies of @xmath27 are not separable . ] ( @xmath28 ) increases with redshift , consistent within the errors with no evolution .",
    "caulet ( 1989 ) compared the lanzetta , turnshek , & wolfe results to results at lower redshift , finding more moderately strong systems and fewer weak systems at @xmath29 as compared to @xmath30 .",
    "the study by steidel & sargent ( 1992 , hereafter ss92 ) , which contained 107 doublets with rest equivalent widths @xmath10  over the redshift range @xmath31 , has served as the standard for the statistics of the distribution of @xmath2 rest equivalent widths @xmath32 , redshift number density @xmath33 , and redshift evolution for the past decade .",
    "their conclusions included the following :    1 .",
    "the @xmath3 distribution can be fit equally well with either an exponential or power law .",
    "@xmath33 for systems with @xmath34  increases with redshift in a manner consistent with no evolution .",
    "the redshift number density @xmath33 for the strongest lines does show evidence for evolution , with @xmath28 decreasing from the no evolution prediction with decreasing redshift .",
    "4 .   the mean @xmath3 increases with redshift . 5 .   there is no evidence for correlation between the doublet ratio @xmath35 and redshift .",
    "churchill et al . ( 1999 , hereafter crcv99 ) , presented a study of 30 `` weak '' ( @xmath36 ) systems , and determined @xmath32 and @xmath33 for the weak extreme of the @xmath3 population .",
    "they favored a power law over an exponential for the parameterization of @xmath32 .",
    "the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) provides an opportunity to improve the statistics of and other low - ion absorption systems by increasing the number of measured systems by orders of magnitude .",
    "the statistics and evolution of the absorber number density , which is the product of the space density and the absorption cross - section , and the distribution of line strengths , which correlate with the number of kinematic subsystems and absorber velocity dispersion , are important factors in understanding the physical nature of systems and their evolution .",
    "furthermore , the strong connection to dla and sub - dla systems ( rao & turnshek 2000 ; rao , turnshek , & nestor 2004 , in preparation ) makes the parameterization of the properties key to the study of large column density systems . finally , only large surveys provide statistically significant numbers of rare , ultra - strong systems for complementary imaging and high - resolution kinematic studies .    in this paper , we present the results from a @xmath0 survey using qso spectra from the sdss early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al .",
    "the results of our analysis , using only a small fraction of the final sdss database , is of interest because with the large number of doublets identified ( over 1,300 with @xmath10 ) , systematic errors already compete with poissonian errors in the measured statistics . in  2 we describe the sdss edr data set , our doublet finding algorithm , and tests for systematic biases . in ",
    "3 we present the results of our analyses , describe the absorber statistics and their parameterizations , and consider sources of systematic errors . in ",
    "4 we discuss our interpretations .",
    "we present our conclusions in  5 .",
    "the sdss edr provides 3814 qso spectra , approximately 3700 of which are of qsos with sufficiently high redshift ( @xmath37 , @xmath38 ) to allow detection of intervening @xmath0 doublets .",
    "we analyzed all available spectra , regardless of qso magnitude , as only a small number were too faint to detect the strongest systems in our catalog .",
    "this data set combines a large number of sightlines with a wide spectral coverage : from 3800   at a resolution of 1800 , to 9200  at a resolution of 2100 .",
    "this corresponds to a absorption redshift coverage of @xmath39 .",
    "typical signal to noise ratios in the sdss edr qso spectra are such that the number of detectable systems drops significantly for @xmath3 less than @xmath40 0.6 , though our catalog includes systems down to @xmath41 .",
    "the strongest system that we found has @xmath42 . at all of these strengths",
    ", the @xmath2 line is typically saturated .",
    "thus , no column density information can be gleaned from @xmath3 . however , large @xmath3 does track high columns and exhibits correlation with line of sight velocity dispersion and metallicity ( see nestor et al .",
    "although the edr qso catalog selection properties are not homogeneous , and therefore not appropriate for statistical analyses , the qso selection criterion should have little affect on the analysis of intervening absorption .",
    "effects related to the qso selection that could impact our results are discussed in  [ sec_se ] .      in order to search the spectra for doublets",
    ", continua were first fitted to the data using the following algorithm .",
    "data below the qso rest - frame ly@xmath23 emission were excluded to avoid the unreliable process of searching for lines in the ly@xmath23 forest , as were data longward of the @xmath0 emission feature . as our only interest is in detecting and measuring the strength of absorption features , we defined a continuum to be the spectrum as it would appear in the absence of absorption features , i.e. , the true continuum plus broad emission lines .",
    "an underlying continuum was fitted with a cubic spline , and broad emission and broad and narrow absorption features were fitted with one or more gaussians and subtracted .",
    "this process was iterated several times to improve the fits of both the spline and gaussians . except for a few problematic areas in a small number of spectra ,",
    "this technique provided highly satisfactory results .",
    "note that by avoiding the ly@xmath23 forest , we do not experience the difficulties that arise in trying to define a continuum in that region .",
    "the fluxes and errors in flux were then normalized by the fitted continua , and these normalized spectra were used for subsequent analyses .",
    "we searched the continuum - normalized sdss edr qso spectra for @xmath0 doublet candidates .",
    "all candidates were interactively checked for false detections , satisfactory continuum fits , blends with absorption lines from other systems , and other special cases .",
    "we used an optimal extraction method ( see schneider et al .",
    "1993 ) to measure each @xmath21 : @xmath43 @xmath44 where @xmath45 represents the line profile , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 the normalized flux and flux error per pixel .",
    "the sum is performed over an integer number of pixels that cover at least @xmath48 characteristic gaussian widths .",
    "many of the lines found were unresolved .",
    "for these , it was appropriate to use the line spread function for the optimal extraction profile , and a gaussian with a width corresponding to the resolution generally provided a very satisfactory fit .",
    "a large proportion of the lines , however , were at least mildly resolved . for these systems , a profile obtained by fitting a gaussian",
    "whose width is only constrained to be greater than or equal to the unresolved width was appropriate . for the large majority of the mildly resolved lines ,",
    "single gaussians were satisfactory fits and our method for measuring @xmath21 gave results consistent with , and with higher significance than , other methods such as direct integration over the line .",
    "in rare cases ( @xmath49 ) , a single gaussian was a poor description of the line profile , and more complex profiles , such as a displaced double - gaussian , were employed .",
    "identifying systems requires the detection of the @xmath2 line and at least one additional line , the most convenient being the @xmath50 doublet partner .",
    "we imposed a 5@xmath51 significance level requirement for all @xmath2 lines .",
    "in addition , we also imposed a 3@xmath51 significance level requirement for the corresponding @xmath50 line , in order to ensure identification of the doublet . in order to avoid a selection bias in the @xmath35 doublet ratio ( @xmath52 ) , which has a maximum value of @xmath53 , we defined a detection limit for @xmath3 , which we call @xmath54 , by taking the larger of 5.0 times the error in @xmath3 or 6.0 times the error in @xmath55 .",
    "the errors were computed using the unresolved profile width at the given redshift to avoid selection bias in the gaussian fit - width . only systems 3,000 km s@xmath56 blueward of @xmath57 and redward of ly@xmath23 emission were accepted .",
    "systems with separations less than 500 kms@xmath56 were considered single systems .",
    "this value was chosen to match the width of the broadest systems found , and is consistent with the window used in the crcv99 study .",
    "we also measured @xmath58 and @xmath59 for confirmed systems , when possible .",
    "we ran monte carlo simulations of the absorber catalog to test the efficiency of our detection technique and to identify biases and systematic effects . for each detected system ,",
    "a simulated doublet having the same redshift , and similar @xmath3 , @xmath52 , and fit width was put into many randomly selected edr spectra .",
    "each spectrum containing a simulated doublet was then run through the entire non - interactive and interactive pipelines , and @xmath26 and @xmath3 were measured for detected systems .",
    "thus , we had two simulated catalogs : the input catalog containing over 9100 simulated doublets , although only @xmath60 of these appear in regions of spectra with sufficient signal to noise ratio to meet the detection threshold for the input @xmath3 , and the simulated output catalog , containing @xmath61 doublets recovered from the simulation .",
    "measurement error in @xmath3 and any subtle systematic effects can cause systems with @xmath62 to scatter into the output catalog as well as systems with @xmath63 to scatter out . however , if the input distribution of @xmath3 does not match the true distribution , the ratio of the @xmath61 recovered systems to the @xmath60 input with @xmath64 is not necessarily an accurate estimate of the biases .",
    "therefore , a trial @xmath3 distribution must be specified according to which lines are chosen from the simulated input catalog .",
    "the trial distribution must then be adjusted so that the simulated output best represents the data .    as the form of the input distribution",
    "is necessarily motivated by the data , further discussion of the simulations and their use for estimating systematic errors are discussed in  [ sec_re ] .",
    "we were able to identify and measure 1331 doublets with @xmath10 .",
    "a small number of additional possible doublets were also discovered ( @xmath65 of the sample ) , but only allowed limits on @xmath3 to be determined or had questionable identifications and were not used in our analyses .",
    "figure [ fig_wdist ] shows the distribution of @xmath3 for our sample . only those systems with @xmath66 which we use in our analyses , are shown .",
    "the distribution has a smooth tail out to @xmath67 , with the largest value @xmath68 .",
    "the total redshift path covered by our sample for each value of @xmath3 is given by : @xmath69 where @xmath70 if @xmath71 and @xmath72 otherwise , and the redshift limits are defined to be 3,000 km s@xmath56 above ly@xmath23 emission and 3,000 km s@xmath56 below emission , or the limits of the data .",
    "bal regions were masked out .",
    "the redshift path coverage is shown in figure [ fig_path_rew ] .",
    "figures [ fig_wdist ] and [ fig_path_rew ] were combined to form an unbiased @xmath3 distribution , which is shown in figure [ fig_rewd ] .",
    "the distribution is fit very well by an exponential , @xmath73 with the maximum likelihood value @xmath6  and corresponding @xmath5 .",
    "the reduced @xmath74 comparing the maximum likelihood fit to the binned data is close to unity , independent of the choice of bin size .",
    "also shown are data from crcv99 with @xmath75  and ss92 with 0.3@xmath76 .",
    "all three data sets have similar average absorption redshifts : the crcv99 data has @xmath77 , and our sdss edr and the ss92 data have @xmath78 .",
    "the ss92 best - fit exponential closely agrees with our sdss results , although our normalization , @xmath79 , is slightly ( @xmath80 ) lower than the ss92 value ( @xmath81 , @xmath82 ) .",
    "the reason for this offset , as well as the lack of scatter as compared to the size of the error bars in the ss92 data , is not clear .",
    "we note that both our survey and the crcv99 study consider systems within 500 km s@xmath56 as a single system , while the ss92 study uses a 1,000 km s@xmath56 window .",
    "this can not be the source of the normalization offset , however , as it would have the opposite effect , reducing the number of systems found by ss92 .",
    "a power law fit of the form @xmath83 with the ss92 values of @xmath84 and @xmath85 is shown as a long - dash line in figure [ fig_rewd ] .",
    "it is a good fit to our data for 0.5  @xmath86 . for large values of @xmath3 , however , the ss92 power law over - predicts @xmath87 by almost an order of magnitude .",
    "crcv99 also fit a power law to their binned data combined with the ss92 binned data , but excluding the highest ss92 bin .",
    "this is shown as a dotted line .",
    "the combined data sets suggest a transition in @xmath87 occurring near @xmath40 0.3 .",
    "we used our simulated catalogs (  [ sec_mc ] ) to test for biases in the @xmath3 distribution .",
    "we chose lines randomly from the input catalog according to a distribution of the form @xmath88 , with an initial guess for @xmath89 , until the number of lines recovered were equal to that of the actual catalog , which determines @xmath90 .",
    "lines with input @xmath75  were used , although only lines with recovered @xmath66  were retained .",
    "we determined a maximum - likelihood value for @xmath91 using the recovered @xmath3 values .",
    "we then corrected our guess for @xmath89 to minimize @xmath92 .",
    "the process was repeated several times with different seeds of the random number generator to determine variance .    except for the weakest systems in our catalog , which were under - predicted ,",
    "this simulation was able to match the actual data well .",
    "the under - prediction could be a weakness of our simulation , as we had few systems with @xmath75  with which to model the low @xmath3 end of the distribution .",
    "alternatively , the actual distribution could diverge from the simulated exponential for @xmath75 , as suggested by the crcv99 data .",
    "thus , though we simulated the entire range @xmath10 , we limited the calculation of @xmath91 to @xmath93 . motivated by the crcv99 results , we then added a second exponential to the input distribution while holding fixed the primary distribution .",
    "we adjusted the values of @xmath13 and @xmath94 for this second exponential to minimize a @xmath74 statistic calculated by comparing the binned simulated output to the binned data . thus , we model the input distribution with separate `` weak '' and `` strong '' components : @xmath95 the resulting best fit values are @xmath96 and @xmath97 , and @xmath98 and @xmath99 , where the errors are the square root of the variances from different choices of random number generator seed . these results are shown in figure [ fig_monte ] .",
    "the `` weak '' values were very stable under changes in the seed , producing small variances .",
    "since the `` weak '' component was constrained by only a small region of @xmath3-space in the data , the actual uncertainties in the parameters are much larger than the variance .",
    "although most of the systems in our sample are at least partially saturated , the distribution of dr values ( see section  [ sec_dr ] ) indicates that the typical degree of saturation increases from a mixture at @xmath100  to virtually all systems being highly saturated at @xmath101 .",
    "thus , we note the possibility that if the column density distribution ( which is _ not _ measurable with sdss data ) is described by a power law over the range of line strengths in our sample , curve - of - growth effects could conceivably cause the corresponding @xmath32 to deviate from a power law at @xmath101  consistent with our results .",
    "nonetheless , the directly measurable @xmath102 is parameterized very well by a single exponential for systems with 0.3  @xmath103 , and by two exponentials for @xmath104 .      in order to investigate evolution in @xmath13 , we split our sample into three redshift bins , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 , chosen such that there are an equal number of systems in each bin .",
    "the three @xmath102 distributions are shown in figure [ fig_rewd_3b ] .",
    "figure [ fig_dwdz ] shows the resulting @xmath13 for each redshift bin ( circles ) and the monte carlo input values ( squares ) .",
    "the bars represent the variance from the different random number seeds only .",
    "the curve in figure [ fig_dwdz ] is the power law fit described in  [ sec_wzd ] .",
    "figure [ fig_nz ] shows the absorption redshift distribution for our sample .",
    "absorption redshifts span the range @xmath108 . the total number of sightlines with sufficient signal to noise ratio to detect lines with @xmath109 for several values of @xmath110 is shown in figure [ fig_sl ] as a function of redshift .",
    "the conspicuous features at @xmath111 are due to poor night sky subtractions in many of the spectra .",
    "the depression near @xmath112 is due to the dichroic ( stoughton et al . 2002 . )",
    "the incidence and variance of lines in an interval of @xmath3 over a specified redshift range are given by : @xmath113 where the sum is over systems with @xmath114 in the given interval and @xmath115 represents the path contained in the specified redshift range .",
    "traditionally , @xmath33 has been plotted versus redshift for lines stronger than a specified @xmath110 . in figure",
    "[ fig_dndz_cumu ] , we show @xmath28 as a function of redshift for @xmath116 0.3 , 0.6 , 1.0 , 1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5 , 3.0and 3.5 . also shown in figure [ fig_dndz_cumu ] are the no - evolution curves ( necs ) for a cosmology with wmap results ( spergel et al .",
    "2003 ) , ( @xmath117 , scaled to minimize the @xmath74 to the binned data .",
    "the @xmath118 0.3 , 0.6 , 1.0 , and 1.5  samples have @xmath74 values that are consistent with no evolution . the @xmath118 2.0 , 2.5 , and 3.0  samples",
    "are inconsistent with the necs at @xmath119 , while the @xmath118 3.5  sample is inconsistent at @xmath120 .",
    "the dotted - boxes in figure [ fig_dndz_cumu ] show the results of the monte carlo simulation described in  [ sec_mc ] .",
    "the large size of our data set allows us to investigate @xmath28 not only for distributions cumulative in @xmath3 , but also for ranges of @xmath3 .",
    "this is potentially important , as evolution in the largest @xmath3 values is not necessarily negligible in cumulative @xmath33 distributions .",
    "thus , we repeated the above analysis for the following ranges : 0.3  @xmath121 0.6 , 0.6  @xmath122 1.0 , 1.0  @xmath122 1.5 , 1.5  @xmath121 2.0 , 2.0  @xmath122 2.5 , 2.5  @xmath122 3.0 , 3.0  @xmath121 3.5 , and @xmath116 3.5 .",

    "since the nec normalization is a free parameter , a plot cumulative in redshift comparing @xmath33 from the data to the nec is more instructive .",
    "these plots , shown in figures [ fig_ks1 ] and [ fig_ks2 ] , highlight the skew of the @xmath33 curves from the nec prediction that is not necessarily manifested in the @xmath74 analysis .",

    "the evolution signal is strong ( @xmath128 ) for lines with @xmath116 3.5 .",
    "although these plots do give a clearer indication of the deviation from the necs , it is difficult to ascribe a k - s probability to the curves in figures [ fig_ks1 ] and [ fig_ks2 ] because systems contribute to @xmath33 in a non - uniform manner , i.e. , inversely proportional to @xmath129 .",
    "the @xmath33 point in the lowest redshift bin for the @xmath116 0.3   sample in figure [ fig_dndz_cumu ] , and for the 0.3  @xmath122 0.6  sample in figure [ fig_dndz_nec ] , lie well above the nec . the increase is greater in magnitude but smaller in significance ( @xmath120 versus @xmath130 ) for the non - cumulative sample .",
    "the monte carlo results lessen the significance in the cumulative sample , but not in the non - cumulative sample . thus , the weakest lines in our study show evolution in the sense that their incidence _ increases _ with decreasing redshift . however , this may be an artifact of the sharp cutoff in our sample at 0.3 .",
    "a sample with @xmath116 0.4  is consistent with the nec , and @xmath33 for 0.4@xmath122 0.6  is within @xmath131 of the nec at all redshifts .",

    "1998 ) : @xmath134 this parameterization is convenient for the determination of best - fit values for the parameters because of the separate @xmath21 and @xmath26 dependences .",
    "however , our data reveal that a single power law is not a good fit to @xmath33 for any given range of @xmath3 .",
    "also , we have shown that @xmath13 depends on redshift for @xmath2 lines ( i.e. , @xmath135 for different ranges of @xmath3 varies differently with redshift . )",
    "we do not wish to abandon the exponential form , however , as we have also shown that it is a very good parameterization of the data at all redshifts for the range of @xmath3 covered by our sample .",
    "thus , we retain the general form @xmath136 , but allow both @xmath94 and @xmath13 to vary with redshift as a power law in @xmath137 .",

    "the values are highly correlated , and the errors include the effects of the correlations .",

    "the results , shown in figures [ fig_dndzf ] and [ fig_ks_cs_fit ] , indicate that our parameterization is indeed a good description of all of the data .",

    "extrapolating our parameterization to lower redshift , we predict @xmath139 for @xmath140  and @xmath141 and @xmath142 for @xmath143  and @xmath144 , in comparison to churchill s ( 2001 ) values of @xmath145 and @xmath146 , respectively . however , our parameterization is likely inappropriate for describing @xmath147  lines , since not including the apparently two - component nature of the @xmath3 distribution leads to underestimates of the number density of weak lines ( figure [ fig_rewd ] ) .",
    "table 2 summarizes the various parameterizations of the data .",
    "our monte carlo simulations did not uncover any significant systematic errors .",
    "all of the monte carlo @xmath33 values are consistent with those from the data . however , since we used the data to model the simulated lines , if there are lines with characteristics that make them underrepresented in the data , they would also be underrepresented in the simulated catalogs .",
    "we ran simulations to address this issue as we developed our line - finding algorithm .",
    "although it is possible that we miss certain types of lines , such as weak kinematic outliers or lines with abnormally broad or exotic profiles , for example , these effects are likely to be small .",
    "a potentially more serious source of systematic error may arise in the regions of poorly subtracted night sky lines seen in some of the spectra .",
    "the error arrays are not always accurate in these regions , and doublets falling between sky lines can be confused with residuals from the poor subtraction",
    ". as the errors are larger ( though not necessarily accurate ) in the night sky regions , the values of @xmath54 are large as well .",
    "thus , only the strongest lines would be affected . in principle",
    ", our simulations should account for these effects .",
    "however , since non - gaussian profiles are preferentially found among the stronger lines , their simulation is somewhat less reliable",
    ". also , their numbers are much smaller , providing fewer lines to serve as models in the simulation , and less overall significance .",
    "the largest @xmath3 ranges were , in fact , too sparse for meaningful simulations .",
    "errors of this type would be manifest in the largest @xmath3 ranges and for redshifts @xmath148 .",
    "finally , in qso absorption - line studies it is of interest to asses if biases due to the presence of the absorber affecting the magnitude and color of the background qso are present .",
    "the most often discussed effect is that of a dimming and reddening of the background qso due to dust in the absorber .",
    "however , the presence of an absorbing galaxy could also contribute light and/or have a lensing effect , causing the qso to appear brighter .",

    "however , extrapolating this exponential to smaller values of @xmath3 under - predicts the incidence of lines ( figure [ fig_rewd ] ) , motivating a two - component description of the form of equation [ eqn2 ] .",
    "this is the first clear indication of such a transition and raises the question of whether the ensemble of clouds comprising absorbers are the result of two physically distinct populations .    in a series of papers using hires / keck data ( charlton & churchill 1998 ; c2000 ;",
    "churchill & vogt 2001 ; churchill , vogt , & charlton 2003 ) , churchill and collaborators have investigated the kinematic structure of absorbers at @xmath169 .",
    "for intermediate / strong absorbers ( @xmath168 ) , they show that the absorption systems are composed of multiple kinematic subsystems , usually containing a dominant subsystem ( ensemble of clouds ) with a velocity width @xmath170kms@xmath56 and a corresponding column density which is optically thick at the lyman limit ( i.e. , @xmath171 atoms @xmath172 ) .",
    "additionally , a number of weaker , often unresolved ( at @xmath406 km s@xmath56 resolution ) subsystems ( clouds ) with a large spread of velocity separations ( up to @xmath173kms@xmath56 ) from the systemic velocity of the absorber are usually present ( see churchill & vogt 2001 , figure 7 . ) these weaker subsystems typically contribute only 10%-20% of the rest equivalent width .",
    "the strongest absorbers ( @xmath174 ) often contain more than one of the dominant subsystems and have equivalent widths dominated by saturated features .",
    "crcv99 presented a hires / keck study of weak ( @xmath175 ) absorption systems .",
    "the properties of the kinematic subsystems comprising weak absorbers are similar to the weak subsystems of intermediate / strong absorbers .",
    "the individual clouds have @xmath176  and sub - lyman limit columns .",
    "although most of the @xmath2 lines in our survey are at least partially saturated , the _ degree _ of saturation is correlated with @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the dr values for systems with 0.3  @xmath177indicate a mix in degree of saturation . for lines in this regime , @xmath32 is sensitive to the distribution of column densities , @xmath178 .",
    "in fact , churchill & vogt ( 2001 ) and churchill , vogt , & charlton ( 2003 ) find almost identical power law slopes for @xmath32 and @xmath178 in their 0.3  @xmath179sample .",
    "systems with @xmath174 , however , are almost always highly saturated .",
    "general _ distinction between weak ( @xmath75 ) and intermediate / strong ( @xmath10 ) absorbers is the absence or presence of a `` dominant '' subsystem , though the differences are neither discrete nor without exception .",
    "additionally , rigby , charlton , & churchill ( 2002 ) note a substantial excess of absorbers that are comprised of a single kinematic component , which are almost exclusively weak absorbers .",
    "therefore , given the form of @xmath32 , it is appropriate to consider a picture in which the _ sum _ of the weaker kinematic subsystems ( clouds ) in an absorber are described by @xmath180 and @xmath181 , and the stronger ( dominant ensembles ) subsystems by @xmath182 and @xmath183 .",
    "if this multi - population explanation is indeed correct , the nature of these populations needs to be explained .",
    "first , we consider the weak subsystems .",
    "it has been demonstrated that absorption line systems can be associated with galaxies out to large galactocentric distances ( @xmath184 kpc for and @xmath185 kpc for ly@xmath23 absorbers , for example ; chen , lanzetta , & webb 2001 ; chen et al .",
    "though there is evidence for ly@xmath23 absorbers in voids ( penton , stocke , & shull 2002 ) , these appear to be limited to the weakest systems .",
    "also , rigby , charlton , & churchill ( 2002 ) conclude that a significant fraction of relatively strong ( @xmath186 @xmath187 @xmath188 @xmath172 ) ly@xmath23 forest lines are associated with single - cloud weak absorbers , which are also absorbers .",
    "therefore , we consider whether single - cloud / ly@xmath23 forest absorbers at relatively large galactocentric distances can contribute significantly to our `` weak '' component of @xmath102 .",
    "crcv99 claim to be 91% complete down to @xmath189 .",
    "thus , using the measurements of single - cloud systems from crcv99 with @xmath190 , we find @xmath191 .",
    "rigby , charlton , & churchill ( 2002 ) give a @xmath33 value for the single - cloud systems , which can be used to normalize @xmath192 .",
    "while our comparison is approximate in that the redshift range covered by the c2000 sample , @xmath193 , is different than that of our sample , the result shown in figure [ fig_lyaf ] demonstrates that the single - cloud / ly@xmath23 forest systems should contribute significantly to the upturn in @xmath102 , especially for the weakest systems .",
    "although the absorber galaxy population has been shown to span a range of galaxy colors and types , steidel , dickinson , & persson ( 1994 ) describe the `` average '' galaxy associated with an intermediate / strong absorber galaxy as one which is consistent with a typical @xmath194 sb galaxy . furthermore , steidel at al .",
    "( 2002 , also see ellison , malln - ornelas , & sawicki 2003 ) compare the galaxy rotation curves to the absorption kinematics for a sample of high inclination spiral absorption galaxies .",
    "they find extended - disk rotation dominant for the absorption kinematics , though a simple disk is unable to explain the range of velocities , consistent with a disk plus halo - cloud picture .",
    "however , there are several counter evidences to a rotating disk description for the dominant subsystems .",
    "the most important is that imaging often fails to reveal a disk galaxy in proximity to the absorption line of sight .",
    "dla galaxies , which are a subset of strong absorbing galaxies , are not dominated by classic spirals .",
    "of the 14 identified dla galaxies summarized in rao et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , only six are spirals .",
    "furthermore , systems that have been studied without the discovery of the absorbing galaxy despite deep imaging rule out at least bright spirals ( although disky - lsbs may still contribute . )",
    "bright galaxies near qso sightlines usually show absorption , but not _ all _ strong absorbers have a nearby spiral or bright galaxy .",
    "thus , though it is clear that rotating disks do contribute to the population comprising the dominant kinematic subsystem(s ) of @xmath10  absorbers , they can only account for a ( perhaps small ) fraction of the total population .",
    "the detailed nature of the remaining contribution is yet unclear , but this dichotomy supports the idea of multiple populations .",
    "bond et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , for example , show that the kinematics of many strong ( defined as @xmath195  in their sample ) absorbers have kinematic structure that is highly suggestive of superwinds / superbubbles .",
    "they also show that dlas exhibit low - ion kinematic profiles distinct from the superwind - like absorbers , which tend to be sub - dla .",
    "furthermore , imaging studies ( e.g. , le brun et al . 1997 ; rao et al .",
    "2003 ) have found lsb , dwarf , and groups / interacting systems , in addition to some spirals , responsible for strong absorption systems ( though the samples are typically selected to be dla sightlines ) .",
    "sightlines through groups and interacting systems are likely to sample large velocity spreads .",
    "apparently , their contribution to the total cross section of strong systems is non - negligible .",
    "thus , though a two - component description is sufficient to describe @xmath32 within the current data , it is likely that more than two physically distinct populations contribute significantly to the phases comprising the absorbing clouds . by observing a large number of galaxy types that sample a range of @xmath3 and impact parameter ,",
    "it would be possible to ascertain what populations contribute most directly to the absorber population .",
    "the relative mean absorber cross - section , @xmath196 , for ranges of @xmath3 can be determined directly from @xmath8 . additionally ,",
    "knowledge of @xmath28 and the galaxy luminosity function ( lf ) allows the approximation of the normalization of the mean absorber cross - section , under the assumption that the absorbers arise in galaxies , since @xmath33 is the product of @xmath196 and the number density of absorbers , @xmath197 .",
    "however , the process is inherently uncertain since : ( a ) the redshift dependence of the galaxy lf is not well determined ; ( b ) although a scaling relation @xmath198 has traditionally been assumed , the determination of @xmath199 is uncertain and likely not universal for all morphological types or redshifts , if it is even appropriate ; and ( c ) depending on the value of @xmath199 and the lf faint - end slope , the minimum absorber galaxy luminosity ( which also is likely to be dependent on morphology and redshift ) can have large effects in the statistically - determined cross sections .",
    "nonetheless , an approximate normalization is of physical interest .",
    "thus , we define @xmath200 to be the effective projected radius for absorption such that @xmath201 .",
    "note that the galactocentric radius within which the absorption may occur ( i.e. , the range of impact parameter ) may be very different than @xmath200 .",
    "steidel , dickinson , & persson ( 1994 ) find absorbing galaxies as faint as @xmath202 , and a scaling law for the gaseous cross - section @xmath203 for both optical ( b - band ) and near - ir ( k - band ) luminosity .",
    "they claim the relation is much tighter for the near - ir .",
    "thus , we use the redshift parameterization of the k - band lf from the munics data set ( drory et al .",
    "2003 ) and @xmath204 , though we also test @xmath205 and @xmath206 to investigate the effects of using high / low values of @xmath207 .",
    "we adopt the dickinson & steidel ( 1996 ) revised scaling law for systems with @xmath10 , namely @xmath208 .",
    "the results for the different @xmath110 values from  3.2 are shown in figure [ fig_cs ] . despite the limitations of this approach , approximate values for @xmath209",
    "are apparent : @xmath210kpc for @xmath10 , @xmath211kpc for @xmath212 , @xmath213kpc for @xmath214  and @xmath215kpc for @xmath216 .",
    "guillemin & bergeron ( 1997 ) find @xmath217 kpc using the upper envelope of the distribution of observed impact parameters for a sample with 0.3@xmath218   and @xmath219 .",
    "crcv99 find @xmath220 kpc for their @xmath104sample , but use a lf normalization that is @xmath221 times our adopted values .",
    "chen , lanzetta , & webb ( 2001 ) find @xmath222 kpc for absorbers , which may sample larger galactocentric radii .",
    "the @xmath209 values are averages ; it is expected that there are large galaxy to galaxy variations .",
    "direct comparison of @xmath209 to the distribution of impact parameters would require knowledge of the gas geometry and the ( likely @xmath3-dependent ) covering factor .",
    "for example , small regions that allow large @xmath3 absorption may be found at galactocentric radii @xmath223 if the covering factor for such absorption is @xmath224 .",
    "we also note that for the single - cloud systems ( see  [ sec_nature ] ) , rigby , charlton , & churchill ( 2002 ) derive @xmath225 .",
    "they claim that these systems are 25%-100% of the ly@xmath23 forest with @xmath186 @xmath226 @xmath27 ( ) @xmath227 @xmath172 . under the assumption that they can be associated with galaxies",
    ", their incidence corresponds to @xmath228 kpc in the above approximation .",
    "this can be compared to the claim of chen et al .",
    "( 2001 ) that all @xmath27 ( ) @xmath229 @xmath172 ly@xmath23 forest lines arise within the characteristic radius @xmath230 kpc of luminous galaxies .",
    "the ly@xmath23 forest @xmath33 is known to decrease strongly over the redshift interval @xmath231 , but little evolution is present at lower redshifts ( see weymann 1998 , and references therein ) . in  [ sec_nature ] , we speculated that a portion of the enriched ly@xmath23 forest contributes to the weak subsystems found in absorbers .",
    "if this is indeed the case , then this evolution may manifest itself in @xmath135 for the weakest ( @xmath75 ) systems at high @xmath26 .",
    "our sample covers the redshift interval @xmath233 to @xmath234 which corresponds to 6.6 gyrs , or about half the age of the universe .",
    "as long assumed and recently demonstrated with the hubble deep fields ( see ferguson , dickinson , & williams 2000 for a review ) , galaxies were quite different at @xmath235 than at @xmath236 .",
    "it is therefore noteworthy that , even with the large absorber sample presented here , relatively little evolution is detected in the bulk of absorption systems . for example",
    ", it is believed that the global star formation rate peaked near @xmath237 and has declined by a factor of @xmath238 by @xmath239 and by a factor of @xmath240 by @xmath241 ( hopkins 2004 and references therein . )",
    "contrastingly , the total cross - section for absorption @xmath242 of our @xmath243  and 1.0  samples evolves @xmath244 from @xmath245 to @xmath239 ( corresponding to an interval of 5 gyrs ) .",
    "the corresponding @xmath200 values do , however , indicate that much of this cross section is at large galactocentric radius , extending well beyond stellar galactic radii .",
    "two immediate conclusions can be drawn from the lack of evolution in the total cross sections .",
    "first , a large majority of the structures responsible for the bulk of the absorption cross - section were in place by @xmath246 .",
    "second , either the time scales governing the dynamics of the structures is greater than several gyrs , or some process(es ) regulate the production / destruction of the structures such that a nearly steady state is reached .",
    "mo & miralda - escud ( 1996 ) explore two - phase models for gaseous galactic halos in which `` cold phase '' clouds condense from the extended `` hot phase '' ionized halo at a cooling radius @xmath247 , and undergo infall at @xmath248 .",
    "setting @xmath249 ( appropriate for a spherical geometry and a covering factor of unity ) , and using @xmath250 kpc , their model results give @xmath251kms@xmath56 over @xmath252 , which is consistent with the observed kinematic ranges over @xmath253 from churchill & vogt ( 2001 ) . using these values",
    "we obtain @xmath254 gyr .",
    "thus , it would appear that a large degree of regulation is necessary , in this picture , to explain the lack of evolution in @xmath242 .",
    "ionization from star formation and the disruption from instabilities and evaporation of smaller clouds should at least partially regulate the cooling .",
    "the result of these and/or other regulatory mechanisms must ensure that the minimum time span over which condensation occurs be equal to at least several times @xmath255 .",
    "alternatively , lifetimes could indeed be much smaller than the time interval here studied , but a range of formation epochs conspire to maintain a roughly constant total cross section . while this scenario seems less likely than early formation epochs and long lifetimes through regulation , it is of note that although individual low - mass halos in @xmath256cdm simulations do themselves evolve , the low - mass end of the total halo mass function shows little evolution in redshift ( reed et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the evolutionary situation for disks may be more complex .",
    "simulations suggest that , to overcome `` angular momentum catastrophe '' , local disks were not formed until @xmath257 ( mo , mao , & white 1998 ; weil , eke , & efstathiou 1998 ) and have since undergone much evolution ( mao , mo , & white , 1998 ) .",
    "disks were likely plentiful at higher @xmath26 , but smaller in size for a given @xmath258 , and largely dissipated or destroyed in mergers .",
    "driver et al .",
    "( 1998 ) find a deficit of @xmath259 spirals in the hdf suggesting that this marks the onset of their formation .",
    "disks certainly contribute at least partially to the absorber population , as suggested by charlton & churchill ( 1998 ) and confirmed for specific cases by steidel et al .",
    "however , even if their contribution to 0.3  @xmath260   absorption systems is significant , the lack of evolution remains difficult to explain .",
    "we detect evolution in @xmath3 systems , in the sense that the strongest lines evolve away , with the evolution being stronger for increasingly stronger lines and at redshifts @xmath20 .",
    "for example , we find that the total cross - section for absorption of systems with @xmath262  ( @xmath263 of all systems with @xmath10 ) decreases by @xmath264 from @xmath265 to 0.6 . the total cross - section for absorption of systems with @xmath216  ( @xmath266 of all systems with @xmath10 ) decreases by @xmath267 from @xmath245 to 0.8 .",
    "note that for the @xmath3 values considered in this work , @xmath3 is correlated with the number of kinematic subsystems ( clouds ) comprising the absorber and thus velocity dispersion .",
    "a speciously simple picture for the evolution of @xmath2 lines considers that velocity dispersions scale with halo mass , and halo masses grow with decreasing redshift . in this picture , with the approximation that the cross - section for a given dispersion scales with mass and the mass spectrum evolves according to the formalism of sheth and tormen ( sheth & tormen 1999 ) , the cross - sections should _ increase _ with decreasing redshift by approximately an order of magnitude per unit redshift for @xmath268 .",
    "this is clearly ruled out by the data .",
    "this can be understood on physical grounds if the low - ionization gas giving rise to absorption is in clouds bound in galaxy halos , since the individual clouds are not expected to be virialized on group scales . a single system sampling a group dispersion would require the chance alignment of several virialized member galaxy halos along the line of sight .",
    "however , c2000 show kinematic profiles of four @xmath269 and one @xmath270 system with @xmath271 , each of which exhibit two strong `` dominant subsystem '' components , and suggest the possibility that the strongest systems have a connection to galaxy pairs . for example",
    ", they find a 25% chance that a random sightline through the galaxy would also intercept the lmc , and a 5% chance that it would intercept the smc .",
    "this possible connection can be investigated by imaging @xmath271  systems : our sample contains 77 such lines with @xmath272 and 20 with @xmath273 .",
    "absorption @xmath33 is the product of the number density of absorbers times the average individual cross - section for absorption .",
    "most galactic halos are already in place by @xmath237 , so except for mergers of galaxies separated by @xmath274kms@xmath56 , the evolution in @xmath33 is primarily an evolution of the gas absorption cross - section in individual halos .",
    "evolution in metallicity or metagalactic ionization can not explain the cross - section evolution , since they would tend to increase the number of individual enriched , low ionization clouds along a line of sight through a galaxy .",
    "the @xmath3-dependent decrease in cross section must therefore be indicative of an evolution in the kinematic properties of a subset of the galaxy population , from intermediate to low redshift .",
    "if interactions , galaxy pairs and superwinds / superbubbles represent a significant fraction of the ultra - strong absorbers , then the decrease in the number of interactions / pairs from high redshift ( e.g. , in the hdf ) and the decrease in the space density of superwinds ( due to the decrease in the global star formation rate at @xmath275 ) may in part account for the evolution in @xmath33 .",
    "although these issues and those discussed in  [ sec_stab ] likely hold clues to the nature of this evolution , a precise description will require knowledge of the physical nature of the clouds that comprise the different ranges of @xmath3 in absorption systems .",
    "we have identified over 1,300 absorption systems with @xmath10  over the redshift range @xmath276 in the sdss edr qso spectra .",
    "the size of the sample is such that statistical errors are comparable to systematic effects and biases .",
