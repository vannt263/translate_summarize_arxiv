    "with dependence of the polarizability tensor eigenvalues and the orientation of the principal axes , the cp force can be either attractive or repulsive .",
    "the general formula is simplified in the special case with integer values of the parameter @xmath215 [ see ( [ ubqint ] ) ] . at distances",
    "much larger than the relevant transition wavelengths , the expression for the function @xmath137 appearing in the expression for the cp potential takes the form ( [ flarge ] ) .",
    "if in addition @xmath140 , one has the asymptotic ( [ frzas ] ) . in this case",
    "the potential varies inversely with the fourth power of the distance from the conducting plate and the corresponding force is attractive with respect to the plate . for integer values of @xmath149 , the asymptotic behavior of the potential",
    "is given by the expression ( [ ubasint ] ) which depends on the orientation of the polarizability tensor principal axes .",
    "for a plate in minkowski spacetime the corresponding asymptotic expression is given by ( ubmas ) and in the leading order the force does not depend on the orientation . for the isotropic polarizability tensor",
    "the plate - induced part in the cp potential is given by the expression ( [ ub1 ] ) with the function @xmath137 given by ( [ frzxiz ] ) .",

    "it is important to call attention to the fact that @xmath217 is divergent at @xmath218 . otherwise , near the string",
    ", its behavior is well defined . for the frequency dependence of the polarizability tensor we have used the anisotropic oscillator model with the eigenvalues given by ( [ alfll ] ) . with this model ,",
    "the function @xmath137 in the expression ( [ ub1 ] ) for the cp  potential takes the form ( [ frzosc ] ) for the general case and the form ( [ frzosciz2 ] ) in the case of isotropic polarizability tensor . in the case of anisotropic polarizability",
    ", the dependence of the cp potential on the orientation of the polarizability tensor principal axes also leads to a moment of force acting on the particle .",
    "this results in the macroscopic polarization of a system of particles induced by combined effects of the string and the boundary .    in the discussion above we have assumed that the electromagnetic field is prepared in the vacuum state . if the field is prepared in a thermal state with temperature @xmath219 a new length scale appears , @xmath220 , with @xmath221 being the boltzmann constant . at nonzero temperature",
