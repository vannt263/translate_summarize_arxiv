    "j/@xmath0  suppression in collisions is considered to be one of the main signatures for the phase transition from an hadronic to a deconfined medium  @xcite .",
    "however , the j/@xmath0  production can be affected also by cold nuclear matter effects , as , for example , the final state absorption of the @xmath1 pair in the nuclear medium , the parton shadowing or the initial and final state energy loss .",
    "the amplitude of these effects , not related to the formation of a deconfined medium , is determined from collisions and then extrapolated to interactions to be compared with the measured j/@xmath0  yield .    at sps energies ,",
    "cold nuclear matter effects are usually parameterized , in the frame of the glauber model , by fitting the a - dependence of the j/@xmath0   production cross section per nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "these nuclear effects are quantified through the value of @xmath2  extracted , up to now , from the na50 data at 400/450 gev ( @xmath2  = 4.2 @xmath3 0.5 mb )  @xcite . another way to parameterize cold nuclear matter effects",
    "is based on a fit to the a - dependence of the j/@xmath0  production cross section using a @xmath4 power law .",
    "a value of @xmath5 different from unity indicates how much the j/@xmath0  yield is modified by the nuclear medium .",
    "it should be noted that both @xmath5 and @xmath2  are effective quantities , since they represent the amount of cold nuclear matter effects reducing the j/@xmath0  yield , but they do not allow to disentangle the different contributions ( e.g. shadowing , nuclear absorption ) playing a role in this reduction .",
    "nuclear effects , evaluated from data at 400/450 gev , are then extrapolated to collisions at a lower energy ( 158a gev ) assuming in both cases a scaling with @xmath6 , the mean thickness of nuclear matter seen by the @xmath1 pair in its way out through the nucleus , and imposing @xmath2  to be energy independent .",
    "the expected j/@xmath0  yield is then compared with the measured one , as a function of centrality . following the aforementioned approach , a further suppression ( the so called `` anomalous '' j/@xmath0  suppression ) , exceeding cold nuclear matter effects ,",
    "is indeed observed at sps in  @xcite and  @xcite collisions .",
    "it is clear that to correctly quantify the amount of suppression due to the formation of a hot medium , the j/@xmath0   behaviour in the normal nuclear matter must be determined with high precision .",
    "several results on j/@xmath0  production in collisions at fixed target experiments are available , covering different kinematic and energy domains .",
    "hera - b at hera , for example , has studied reactions at 920 gev  @xcite , e866 at fnal collisions at 800 gev  @xcite , na50 at sps proton induced collisions on several nuclei ( be , al , cu , ag , w , pb ) at 400/450 gev  @xcite and finally na3 at sps collisions at 200 gev  @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that none of these existing results has been obtained under the same conditions , in terms of energy and kinematic domain , as the sps collisions collected at 158a gev .",
    "this implies that several assumptions ( as the energy independence of @xmath2   ) had to be done , in order to extrapolate cold nuclear matter effects from to collisions .",
    "for the first time the na60 experiment has studied the j/@xmath0  production in collisions at 158 gev  @xcite , in order to provide a reference collected under the same kinematic and energy conditions as the data .",
    "the experimental apparatus of na60 is based on a traditional muon spectrometer coupled with a vertex telescope made of si pixel planes , close to the target region .",
    "the matching , based on the tracks coordinates and momentum between the tracks reconstructed in the two spectrometers , allows an accurate measurement of the muon kinematics and therefore an improvement in the quality of the results with respect to previous experiments . for details on the apparatus see  @xcite .",
    "the target system of na60 , during the data taking , was based on 7 different targets ( be , al , cu , in , w , pb , u ) simultanously exposed to the beam .",
    "na60 has also collected data at 400 gev , with the same experimental setup as the one of the 158 gev data taking period , to be used as a cross - check of the na50 results taken at the same energy .",
    "the investigation of the j/@xmath0  kinematical distributions may help to obtain further insights in the understanding of the charmonium production and initial state effects . in fig.[fig:1 ]",
    "the rapidity ( @xmath8 ) distributions corresponding to collisions at 158 gev and 400 gev are shown . a 1-d acceptance correction has been performed assuming realistic transverse momentum distributions and a flat cos@xmath9 shape ( see sec.[sec : pol ] for this definition ) . within the narrow rapidity coverage of na60 ( one rapidity unit ) , the distributions can be reproduced by a gaussian function .",
    "a simultaneous fit to the distributions corresponding to the different collisions indicates that , at 158 gev , the data can be described by a gaussian centered at midrapidity ( @xmath10 ) with a width @xmath11 . at 400 gev , because of the wider distributions , the peak position is less constrained . in this case",
    "the fit is performed imposing the slightly negative mean value ( @xmath12 ) measured by na50 with a high statistics data set at the same energy  @xcite . as expected ,",
    "because of the higher energy , a larger rapidity width ( @xmath13 ) is obtained , in agreement , within errors with the na50 value ( @xmath14 )",
    ". unfortunately , the precision of these results do not allow to investigate the negative rapidity shift observed by na50 , neither to confirm the smaller a - dependent shift of the center of the @xmath15 ( and therefore @xmath16 ) distributions observed by hera - b  @xcite .",
    "acceptance corrected rapidity distributions at 158 gev ( left ) and 400 gev ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]  acceptance corrected rapidity distributions at 158 gev ( left ) and 400 gev ( right).,title=\"fig : \" ]    the j/@xmath0  transverse momentum ( @xmath17 ) distributions have also been studied .",
    "the spectra are corrected with an 1-d acceptance , obtained assuming a flat @xmath17 distribution and realistic @xmath16 and cos@xmath9 shapes .",
    "a broadening of the @xmath17 distributions as a function of a is measured at both 158 and 400 gev .",
    "this confirms previous observations from other experiments  @xcite and is usually interpreted as initial state multiple scattering of the incoming gluons ( cronin effect ) before the hard scattering which will produce the @xmath1 pair .",
    "the average @xmath18 dependence on the mass number can be parameterized with @xmath19  @xcite , where @xmath20 is roughly proportional to the length @xmath21 . as shown in fig.[fig:2 ] ( left )",
    "the @xmath22 values are compatible with a linear growth with the square of the center of mass energy @xmath23 . on the other hand ,",

    "right : j/@xmath0  cross section ratios for collisions at 158 gev ( circles ) and 400 gev(squares ) , as a function of @xmath25.,title=\"fig : \" ]      new na60 results on the nuclear effects affecting the j/@xmath0  at 158 gev have been presented at this conference  @xcite .",
    "results , integrated over the full @xmath17 range are given in the rapidity region , covered by all the subtargets , corresponding to @xmath26 .",
    "nuclear effects are evaluated comparing the cross section ratio , @xmath27 , between the target with mass number a and the lightest one ( be ) . by computing this ratio ,",
    "the beam luminosity factors cancel out , apart from a small beam attenuation factor .",
    "however , since the sub - targets see the vertex telescope under a slightly different angle , the track reconstruction efficiencies do not completely cancel out .",
    "therefore an accurate evaluation of such quantities and their time evolution has been performed target by target , with high granularity down to the single pixel level , and on a run - per - run basis .",
    "j/@xmath0  cross - section ratios are shown in fig.[fig:2 ] ( right ) as a function of @xmath21 . in the same figure , also results from a similar analysis performed on the 400 gev data sample are shown . in this case , the results refer to the kinematical region @xmath28 , corresponding to the same rapidity range , in the laboratory frame , as the 158 gev one .",
    "systematic errors include uncertainties on the target thickness , on the @xmath29 distribution used in the acceptance calculation and on the reconstruction efficiency .",
    "only the fraction of systematic error , not in common to all the points , is shown , since it is the one affecting the evaluation of the nuclear effects .    performing a glauber fit to the data , or using the @xmath5 parameterization ,",
    "the following results are obtained for the new na60 data : @xmath2  = 7.6 @xmath3 0.7 ( stat . ) @xmath3 0.6 ( syst . ) mb ( @xmath5 = 0.882 @xmath3 0.009 @xmath3 0.008 ) at 158 gev and @xmath2  = 4.3 @xmath3 0.8 ( stat . )",
    "@xmath3 0.6 ( syst . ) mb ( @xmath5 = 0.927 @xmath3 0.013 @xmath3 0.009 ) at 400 gev .",
    "it has to be stressed that the @xmath2  result at 400 gev is smaller with respect to the one extracted from the 158 gev , pointing to an energy dependence of this quantity .",
    "furthermore , the obtained value is in very good agreement with a previous result obtained by na50 at the same energy  @xcite .",
    "the comparison with results from previous experiments ( hera - b , e866 and na50 ) can be done in terms of the extracted @xmath5  @xcite or @xmath2  values , as a function of the feyman @xmath30 variable ( @xmath31 ) . as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] ( left ) , where all the available measurements are compared , a strong dependence of @xmath2  on @xmath31 and on the beam energy is clearly visible .",
    "cold nuclear matter effects are stronger at high @xmath31 and for a fixed @xmath31 value their importance increases while lowering the beam energy .",
    "as shown in the figure , the new na60 results at 400 gev confirm the na50 values obtained at a similar energy . on the other hand ,",
    "the 158 gev data seem to point to higher @xmath2  values , with a hint for an increase in the narrow explored @xmath31 region .",
    "it is also worthwhile to note that older na3 results  @xcite on j/@xmath0   production are in partial contradiction with these observations , showing lower @xmath2  values , rather similar to those obtained with the higher energy data samples .",
    "although not shown here , the results do not present any scaling with @xmath32 , the fraction of nucleon momentum carried by the target colliding partons .",
    "since @xmath32 is the variable driving the shadowing effects , the break of this scaling confirms the fact that parton shadowing can not be the only mechanism invoked to describe the data . it",
    "is , therefore , clear that the interpretation of the kinematical dependence of the cold nuclear matter effects is extremely complicated since there are many competing mechanisms affecting the j/@xmath0  production and propagation into the nuclei .",
    "a theoretical description of the cold nuclear matter effects over the full kinematic range is extremely complex and not yet available  @xcite .",
    "as discussed , the @xmath5 or the @xmath2  values are effective quantities used to describe the convolution of all the cold nuclear effects not related to the formation of a deconfined medium . at this conference ,",
    "a first attempt to take explicitly into account the parton shadowing contribution to the na60 data has been proposed .",
    "it must be noted that at sps energies , the charmonia production explores a range of @xmath30 ( the fraction of the nucleon momentum carried by the parton ) corresponding to the antishadowing region , where parton densities in the nuclei are enhanced with respect to those of the free nucleons .",
    "the antishadowing , evaluated with the eks98@xcite parameterization for the nuclear modification of the parton distribution functions ( pdf ) , causes an enhancement of the charmonium production cross section per nucleon - nucleon collision .",
    "therefore , if this initial - state contribution is explicitly taken into account , a larger @xmath2  value is needed to describe the measured data ( @xmath2(158gev ) = @xmath33 mb and @xmath2(400gev ) = @xmath34 mb ) .",
    "results depend on the adopted parameterization of the pdf nuclear modifications .",
    "slightly higher @xmath2  values ( @xmath35% ) , for example , are obtained if the eps08  @xcite parameterization is used .",
    "values versus @xmath31 .",
    "right : j/@xmath0  suppression pattern in ( circles ) and ( triangles ) .",
    "boxes around the points correspond to the correlated systematic errors , while the filled box on the right is the uncertainty on the absolute normalization of the points .",
    "a further global 12% error , not shown , is due to the uncertainty on @xmath2  .,title=\"fig : \" ]  values versus @xmath31 .",
    "right : j/@xmath0  suppression pattern in ( circles ) and ( triangles ) .",
    "boxes around the points correspond to the correlated systematic errors , while the filled box on the right is the uncertainty on the absolute normalization of the points .",
    "a further global 12% error , not shown , is due to the uncertainty on @xmath2  .,title=\"fig : \" ]",
    "as previously discussed , the cold nuclear matter reference used up to now for collisions by na50  @xcite and na60  @xcite was based on the @xmath2  value obtained from collisions at 400/450 gev , assuming @xmath2  to be independent of the incident energy and @xmath36 range . as shown in fig.[fig:3 ] ( left ) , this is not the case , since the cold nuclear matter effects strongly depend on the energy and kinematical domain .",
    "therefore the evaluation of the size of the effects affecting collisions at 158a gev must be based on the new na60 results at the same energy .",
    "the expected shape for the j/@xmath0  distribution in cold nuclear matter is computed within a glauber model , assuming the j/@xmath0  production as a function of centrality ( determined measuring the energy , @xmath37 , released in a zero degree calorimeter ) @xmath38 to scale with the number of binary collisions .",
    "the nuclear effects affecting the j/@xmath0  are then implemented assuming @xmath2  = 7.6 @xmath3 0.7 @xmath3 0.6 mb , as discussed in the previous section .",
    "this reference curve is then compared with the measured @xmath39 distribution , following the procedure described in  @xcite .",
    "as expected , since the @xmath2  value directly obtained at 158 gev is higher than the one extracted from data at 400/450 gev , the amount of anomalous suppression will be smaller with respect to the previous estimates .",
    "furthermore , in the procedure followed up to now to build the reference curve , shadowing effects were not explicitly taken into account . while in data only partons in the target are affected by shadowing , in collisions also the projectile is involved and this further contribution has to be included when extrapolating the cold nuclear effects from to  @xcite .",
    "it turns out that if the shadowing is neglected in this extrapolation , a small bias is introduced , resulting in a @xmath405% artificial contribution to the suppression of the j/@xmath0  yield ( if the eks98 parameterization is used for the shadowing evaluation ) .",
    "therefore , if shadowing is properly taken into account in the extrapolation from to , a further reduction of the j/@xmath0  suppression is observed .",
    "this is shown in fig.[fig:3 ] ( right ) , where the final ratio of the measured and expected j/@xmath0  yield is presented as a function of the number of participants ( @xmath41 ) for both and data . even within this new definition of the reference curve , for very central collisions ( @xmath42 )",
    "an anomalous j/@xmath0  suppression , of the order of 20 - 30% , is still visible .",
    "the measurement of the j/@xmath0  polarization is an important tool to clarify the quarkonium production mechanism , since different theoretical models predict different degrees of polarization  @xcite .",
    "for example , polarization is expected to be sensitive to the spin states of the @xmath1 pair  @xcite , therefore its measurement can shed some light on the color - singlet and color - octet contributions to the production process .",
    "contrary to other observables , as the differential cross - sections , in the polarization predictions uncertainties related to the theoretical inputs cancel out , therefore providing well - defined expected values .",
    "however , quarkonium polarization has always represented a puzzle , since , at collider experiments , the theoretical models , which were able to predict the observed j/@xmath0  production cross section , clearly failed in the description of the @xmath17 dependence of the polarization  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , the j/@xmath0  polarization is measured from the full angular distribution of the quarkonium decay products : @xmath43 where the polar angle @xmath44 is determined by the direction of the positive muon , in the quarkonium rest frame , and a chosen @xmath45 polarization axis ( defining the decay plane ) .",
    "@xmath46 is the azimuthal angle between the reaction plane , containing the colliding hadrons and the decay plane .",
    "the @xmath47 parameter is traditionally called `` polarization '' : zero value for @xmath47 indicates that the j/@xmath0  are not polarized , while @xmath47=1(-1 ) means transverse ( longitudinal ) polarization .",
    "non zero values of @xmath48 and @xmath49 indicate an azimuthal anisotropy of the distributions .",
    "@xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 depend on the chosen definition of the @xmath45 axis .",
    "it is , therefore , useful , to determine these parameters in more than one reference frame .",
    "however , it can be noted that the knowledge of the full set of coefficients allows to analytically calculate their values in other frames , through appropriate transformations and knowing the j/@xmath0   kinematics  @xcite . of course , this is not the case if only the @xmath47 parameter is measured . in the literature",
    "the most commonly used frames are the collins - soper ( cs ) one , where the @xmath45 axis is parallel to the bisector of the angle between the projectile and target directions in the j/@xmath0  rest frame , and the helicity ( he ) one , where the @xmath45 axis coincides with the quarkonium direction in the target - projectile center of mass frame .",
    "it is important to note that because of the @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 dependence on a chosen reference frame , polarization results from different experiments can be compared only if the same frame is adopted .",
    "most previous polarization analyses up to now were limited to the choice of only one specific reference frame and were restricted to the measurement of the polar angle distribution . on the contrary ,",
    "recent results from hera - b  @xcite and na60  @xcite have been obtained measuring for the first time the full angular distribution of the decay products of charmonia and comparing different frames .",
    "na60 results are obtained applying a 1-d acceptance correction , assuming realistic @xmath50 and @xmath17 distributions and a flat cos@xmath44 and @xmath46 spectra .",
    "the measured polarization values present a dependence on the j/@xmath0   transverse momentum , as shown in fig.[fig:4 ] ( left ) for the helicity frame .",
    "in particular , hera - b @xmath47 results indicate an increase of the j/@xmath0   polarization , moving from slightly negative values ( corresponding to longitudinal polarization ) at low @xmath17 to values close to zero ( absence of polarization ) at higher @xmath17 .",
    "the first polarization results obtained in collisions at 158 gev and 400 gev by the na60 experiment confirm , within errors , the observed trend .    in fig.[fig:4 ]",
    "( left ) results on the the azimuthal parameter @xmath49 are also shown , always in the helicity frame . in this case",
    "no clear dependence on the j/@xmath0  kinematics is visible .",
    "also the @xmath48 parameter is consistent with zero everywhere .",
    "although not shown here , both hera - b and na60 results in the collins - soper reference frame give @xmath47 values which tend to be more negative and larger in absolute value with respect to the ones measured in the helicity frame .",
    "this is an confirmation of the fact that the polarization parameters have a clear dependence on the chosen frame .",
    "polarization parameters @xmath47 ( top ) and @xmath49 ( bottom ) as a function of @xmath51 in the helicity frame for collisions from hera - b and na60 .",

    "na60 has also provided , for the first time , results on the full angular distribution of the j/@xmath0  decay products in collisions .",

    "the @xmath47 and @xmath49 values do not present any dependence even on the centrality of the collision , as shown in fig.[fig:4 ] ( c , d ) .",
    "the pattern of these results is confirmed also if the collins - soper frame is adopted . in principle , it may be expected that the formation of a hot medium may affect the j/@xmath0  polarization , as proposed in  @xcite .",
