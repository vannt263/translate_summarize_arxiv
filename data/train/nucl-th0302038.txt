    "in the past few years there has been renewed interest @xcite in the extraction of the isovector @xmath0-wave @xmath1 scattering amplitude near threshold from pionic atom observables . of particular interest",
    "is the relationship between this in - medium amplitude and the corresponding amplitude for the free @xmath1 interaction at threshold .",
    "this renewed interest in pionic atoms in general , and in the @xmath0-wave part of the potential in particular , stems from three recent developments .",
    "the first one is the experimental observation of ` deeply bound ' pionic atom states in the ( d,@xmath5he ) reaction @xcite , the existence of which was predicted a decade earlier @xcite .",
    "the second one is the very accurate measurements of the shift and width of the 1@xmath0 level in pionic hydrogen @xcite and in pionic deuterium @xcite which leads to precise values for the @xmath0-wave @xmath1 scattering lengths ( see also ref .",
    "the third development is the attempt to explain the ` anomalous ' @xmath0-wave repulsion @xcite in terms of a density dependence of the pion decay constant @xcite , or very recently by constructing the @xmath1 amplitude near threshold within a systematic chiral perturbation expansion @xcite and in particular imposing on it gauge invariance @xcite .",
    "the so - called anomalous repulsion of the @xmath0-wave pionic atom potential is the empirical finding , from fits of optical potentials to pionic atom data , that the strength of the repulsive @xmath0-wave potential inside nuclei is typically twice as large as is expected on the basis of the free @xmath1 interaction .",
    "it is interesting to note that early indications for a very repulsive isovector @xmath0-wave amplitude go as far back as 1978 @xcite when high precision data became available .",
    "subsequent analyses @xcite also indicated such a repulsive amplitude . a key point in this problem",
    "are the uncertainties which are associated with the empirical determination of the relevant potential parameters .",
    "this problem has been aggravated by recent works in which the ` deeply bound ' pionic atom states were granted special status and unfounded implicit assumptions were made on the pion - nucleus optical potential ( e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite ) . the present work addresses all these issues with the aim of obtaining reliable parameter values for the @xmath0-wave part of the pion - nucleus optical potential at threshold , together with realistic estimates of uncertainties .",
    "the focus of this work is on the extraction of @xmath6 , the in - medium _ isovector _",
    "@xmath0-wave @xmath1 amplitude , from pionic atom data , using the conventional ( density - independent ) @xmath7-nucleus optical potential .",
    "it is shown that no definitive conclusions can be reached on whether or not @xmath6 is renormalized with respect to its free - space value unless the whole bulk of pionic - atom data across the periodic table is used in the analysis . in particular , the deeply bound 1@xmath0 states observed recently in the ( d,@xmath5he ) reaction @xcite do not offer conclusive evidence for a renormalization of @xmath6 .",
    "that applies also to analyses using the deeply bound states together with ` normal ' 1@xmath0 states @xcite .",
    "section [ sect : potl ] presents briefly the conventional pion - nucleus potential @xcite where the various parameters are defined .",
    "section [ sect : radii ] is devoted to a discussion of the proton and neutron density distributions which are an essential ingredient of the pion - nucleus optical potential .",
    "the proton densities obviously are obtained from the quite well known charge distributions of nuclei but the neutron distributions are generally not known to a sufficient accuracy . for this reason",
    "simple but physical parameterizations of the neutron density distributions are introduced , in comparison with available data and with nuclear models .",
    "the dependence of the isovector @xmath0-wave @xmath1 amplitude on the neutron distributions was only marginally touched upon in recent works @xcite and , therefore , we study in section [ sect : results ] in some detail the dependence of this amplitude on both the root mean square ( rms ) radius of the distribution and , to some extent , on the shape of the distribution .",
    "this dependence is translated then into an additional uncertainty of the extracted parameter values .",
    "section [ sect : results ] also presents the results of fits to the data , starting with ` global ' fits to 100 and 120 data points and gradually reducing the extent of the data base in order to assess the accuracy of the results , in comparison with other works using ` partial ' fits to very limited sets of data @xcite that place special emphasis on the deeply bound 1@xmath0 states in @xmath8sn and in @xmath9pb .",
    "the last subsection of section [ sect : results ] discusses the seki - masutani linearization scheme @xcite demonstrating the limits of its applicability to pionic - atom studies . in section [",
    "sect : deep ] we explain why the deeply bound pionic atom states generally have failed to provide new information on the pion - nucleus interaction . a brief summary and conclusions are presented in sect .",
    "[ sect : summ ] .",
    "the pion - nucleus potential has been extensively discussed ( e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) , but for completeness a short summary follows .",
    "the interaction of pions at threshold with the nucleus is described by the klein - gordon equation of the form :    @xmath10 \\psi = 0~~ ~~ ( \\hbar = c = 1)\\ ] ]    where @xmath11 is the pion - nucleus reduced mass , @xmath12 is the complex binding energy and @xmath13 is the finite - size coulomb interaction of the pion with the nucleus , including vacuum - polarization terms .",
    "the optical potential @xmath14 used in the present work is of the canonical form due to ericson and ericson @xcite ,    @xmath15    with @xmath16    + b_1[\\rho_n(r)-\\rho_p(r ) ] \\ }",

    "the function @xmath28 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : ee1s ] ) is given in terms of the _ local _ fermi momentum @xmath29 corresponding to the isoscalar nucleon density distribution :    @xmath30    where @xmath31 and @xmath6 are minus the pion - nucleon isoscalar and isovector effective scattering lengths , respectively .",
    "the quadratic terms in @xmath31 and @xmath6 represent double - scattering modifications of @xmath31 . in particular , the @xmath32 term represents a sizable correction to the nearly vanishing linear @xmath31 term .",
    "similar modifications of @xmath6 @xcite were found by us to be negligibly small .",
    "the coefficients @xmath33 and @xmath34 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : alp1 ] ) are the pion - nucleon isoscalar and isovector @xmath27-wave scattering volumes , respectively . the parameters @xmath35 and @xmath36 in eqs .",
    "( [ equ : ee1s ] ) and ( [ equ : alp2 ] ) represent @xmath0-wave and @xmath27-wave absorption , respectively , on pairs of nucleons and as such they have imaginary parts .",
    "dispersive real parts are found to play an important role in pionic atom potentials .",
    "the terms with @xmath37 were originally written as @xmath38 , but the results hardly depend on which form is used .",
    "the parameter @xmath39 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : ll2 ] ) is the usual ericson - ericson lorentz - lorenz ( eell ) coefficient @xcite .",
    "an additional relatively small term , known as the ` angle - transformation ' term ( see eq.(24 ) of @xcite ) , is also included .",
    "the pion - nucleus optical potential contains nine parameters but only six parameters were varied in the present fits , namely , all the parameters of the @xmath0-wave part of the potential and the empirical complex @xmath27-wave absorption parameter @xmath36 . the linear @xmath27-wave parameters",
    "@xmath33 and @xmath34 were kept fixed at their respective free @xmath1 values , as discussed extensively in ref .",
    "the eell coefficient was held fixed at the value @xmath39 = 1 .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that the extracted @xmath0-wave parameters are insensitive , with negligibly small variations , to sizable variations of the @xmath27-wave parameters , _ provided _ a fit to the data was made .",
    "note that the extracted parameters @xmath31 and @xmath6 are some averages over nuclear densities of in - medium quantities , and if they turn out to be different from the corresponding free @xmath1 values then one could refer to a renormalization of the free space values in the nuclear medium .",
    "it is evident from the previous section that the nuclear density distributions @xmath21 and @xmath20 are an essential part of the pion - nucleus potential .",
    "nevertheless , their effect in the present context of studying the @xmath0-wave part of the potential and in particular the dependence of the parameter @xmath6 on the choice of nuclear densities has been hardly addressed , and only briefly so in refs .",
    "this point is studied in more detail in the present work .",
    "nuclear charge densities are known quite well @xcite from studies of elastic scattering of electrons and from finite - size effects in muonic atoms .",
    "density distributions for protons can then be obtained by unfolding the finite size of the charge of the proton .",
    "this leads to reliable proton densities , particularly in the surface region , which is the relevant region for producing strong - interaction effects in pionic atoms .",
    "the neutron distributions are , however , generally not known to sufficient accuracy .",
    "a host of different methods have been applied to the extraction of rms radii of neutron distributions in nuclei @xcite , including some studies using pionic atoms @xcite , but the results are sometimes conflicting .",
    "several nuclei have been studied more than others , e.g. isotopes of ca , sn and pb @xcite but for others there is no experimental information on neutron densities and one must then rely on calculations based on various models . to complicate things",
    "further we note that there is a long history of conflict between values of neutron rms radii derived from experiments using hadronic projectiles and neutron rms radii derived from theoretical calculations .",
    "for that reason we have adopted a semi - phenomenological approach that covers a broad range of possible neutron density distributions .",
    "it is shown below that the feature of neutron density distributions which is most effective in determining strong interaction level shifts and widths in pionic atoms is the radial extent , as represented , for example , by @xmath40 , the neutron density rms radius .",
    "other features such as the detailed shape of the distribution have only minor effect .",
    "for that reason we chose the rms radius as the prime parameter in the present study . since @xmath41 ,",
    "the rms radius for the proton density distribution , is considered to be known , we focus attention on values of the difference @xmath42 . in the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite the nuclear densities were either of the single particle ( sp ) variety or of the macroscopic type @xcite where the values of @xmath42 were taken from the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) results of lalazissis et al .",
    "@xcite for each of the nuclei involved .",
    "smaller values of @xmath42 were also used in ref .",
    "@xcite . in the present work we vary , among other things , the values of @xmath42 and",
    "we therefore look for a simple parameterization that will be easy to relate to the rmf results . choosing 43 stable nuclei along the periodic table",
    ", the calculated rmf values @xcite of @xmath42 are described very well by the expression    @xmath43    figure [ fig : rmf ] shows the results of this linear fit in the neutron - proton asymmetry @xmath44 , where we have arbitrarily assigned an error of @xmath450.03 fm to each value of @xmath42 , as a representative value of discrepancies between calculated and experimental charge rms radii .",
    "the rmf fit parameters obtained are @xmath46=1.51@xmath450.07  fm , @xmath47=@xmath480.03@xmath450.01 fm .",
    "an expression of the form ( [ equ : rmf ] ) has also been used recently in connection with antiprotonic atoms @xcite , with parameter values of @xmath46=1.01@xmath450.15 fm , @xmath47=@xmath480.04@xmath450.03 fm .",
    "note that antiprotonic atoms are sensitive to nuclear densities well below 10% of the central density and as such it is not very reliable to infer from these data quantities which relate to the bulk of the density .",
    "nevertheless we consider these results as an experimental indication on values of @xmath42 , particularly as they have been used @xcite in analyses of pionic atoms . in the present work",
    "the neutron rms radii were then varied using eq.([equ : rmf ] ) with @xmath47=@xmath49 fm and varying the parameter @xmath46 between 0.3 and 2.7 fm . this way we have covered a very wide range of possible values of neutron rms radii .    in order to allow for possible differences in the shape of the neutron distribution , the ` skin ' and the ` halo ' forms of ref .",
    "@xcite were used , as well as an average between the two .",
    "assuming a two - parameter fermi distribution both for the proton ( unfolded from the charge distribution ) and for the neutron density distributions    @xmath50    then for each value of @xmath42 in the skin form the same diffuseness parameter for the protons and the neutrons @xmath51 was used and the @xmath52 parameter was determined from the rms radius @xmath40 . in the halo form",
    "the same radius parameter @xmath53 was assumed and @xmath54 was determined from @xmath40 . in the ` average ' option",
    "the diffuseness parameter was set to be the average of the above two diffuseness parameters @xmath55 and the radius parameter @xmath52 was determined from the rms radius @xmath40 . in this way we have used three shapes of the neutron distribution for each value of its rms radius all along the periodic table .",
    "for the study of the dependence on the neutron density distribution using the parameterization of eq .",
    "( [ equ : rmf ] ) above we first chose a data base of 100 points , from @xmath56ne to @xmath57u , including the recently published results for the deeply bound 1@xmath0 states in @xmath8sn @xcite and those for the 1@xmath0 and 2@xmath27 states in @xmath9pb @xcite .",
    "ne was chosen as the lightest element because it is the first element in the periodic table for which the rmf results @xcite apply and because we use the two - parameter fermi parameterization for the densities .",
    "fits to the data were made by varying six of the parameters of the potential , as discussed is sect .",
    "[ sect : potl ] .",
    "figure [ fig : chi2 ] shows @xmath58 values for the three types of neutron density , namely , skin , halo and average , as a function of @xmath46 , the coefficient of the asymmetry parameter @xmath44 which determines the value of @xmath42 , see eq .",
    "( [ equ : rmf ] ) . also marked by asterisks",
    "are the points associated with the particular values of @xmath46=1.01 fm and @xmath46=1.51 fm , which refer to the ` @xmath59 ' and the rmf prescriptions , respectively .",
    "it is easy to conclude from this figure that in the context of global fits to pionic atom data the rmf radii and the skin shape are the favoured option .",
    "note that the minimum of @xmath58 implies @xmath60/f , the @xmath58 per degree of freedom , of 1.8 , which represents a very good fit . increasing the data base to 120 points by adding 20 points from @xmath61c to @xmath62f and repeating the fits ,",
    "the overall picture remains essentially the same , but the minima become less sharp and imply slightly larger values of @xmath60/f .",
    "for these additional nuclei ( except @xmath62f ) a modified harmonic oscillator form @xcite was used for the densities .",
    "the above results may be interpreted as indicating that on the average the difference @xmath42 is described rather well by the rmf model ( @xmath46=1.5 fm ) . however , when other experimental data had been analyzed in terms of the difference between rms radii @xcite , quite often smaller values were obtained for @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath46 between 1 and 1.5 in eq .",
    "( [ equ : rmf ] ) .",
    "note that brueckner - hartree - fock calculations generally yield values of @xmath42 corresponding to @xmath63 1.0 @xcite .",
    "we therefore conclude that on the average , rms radii of neutron density distributions are between the values inferred from analyses of antiprotonic atoms ( @xmath46 = 1.0 ) @xcite and the predictions of rmf calculations @xcite .    turning to the question of the dependence of extracted parameters of the pion - nucleus optical potential on the neutron distribution used in the analysis , fig .",
    "[ fig : b1radii ] shows the values of @xmath6 which correspond to the @xmath58 results displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : chi2 ] .",
    "it is evident that there is a fairly strong dependence of the extracted @xmath6 on the prescription chosen for @xmath42 , whereas the dependence on the shape of the density distribution , as indicated by the scatter of points for each value of @xmath46 , is small .",
    "a similar plot of the results of fits to the 120 data points mentioned above is almost indistinguishable from the present figure .",
    "adopting an average value of @xmath46= 1.25@xmath450.25 fm as discussed above , one can estimate the additional uncertainty of the extracted potential parameters , due to neutron densities , with the help of plots like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : b1radii ] .      several recent publications @xcite have claimed exceedingly small uncertainties for the parameter @xmath6 when it is extracted from data bases which are very small in comparison with the 100 - 120 points of data used above .",
    "such claims are based on adopting several linearizations of terms in the optical potential eq .",
    "( [ equ : ee1s ] ) , notably the seki - masutani correlation @xcite , which are at variance with the results of global fits to large scale data bases , see refs . @xcite and the following subsection .",
    "we have , therefore , repeated the analysis using progressively reduced data bases in order to examine _ in a consistent manner _",
    "the dependence of the uncertainties on the data , including also the uncertainty in the neutron density ditribution .",
    "the results of this survey are summarized in tables [ tab : res1 ] and [ tab : res2 ] .",
    "the results in table [ tab : res1 ] are based on the use of the ` rmf skin ' neutron densities and the results in table [ tab : res2 ] are based on the use of the ` @xmath59 skin ' densities .",
    "the ` global 2 ' and ` global 3 ' data sets are the ones mentioned in the previous subsection ( ` global 1 ' was used in ref .",
    "three ` partial ' data sets are included in the tables , as follows : ( i)1@xmath0 states in light pionic atoms from @xmath61c to @xmath64si ; ( ii)1@xmath0 states in light @xmath65 pionic atoms plus the deeply bound 1@xmath0 states in @xmath8sn @xcite and @xmath9pb @xcite ; and ( iii)only the deeply bound states of ( ii ) . within each table",
    "it is seen that the parameter values are consistent with each other as the size of the data base is changed , but the uncertainties increase as the data base becomes smaller .",
    "note that re@xmath35 is different from zero , within errors , only for the global fits .",
    "claims based on ` partial ' data sets that no re@xmath35 is required to fit the data therefore do not hold for pionic atoms in general . in tables",
    "[ tab : res1 ] and [ tab : res2 ] , for the fit to only deeply bound states , we have set re@xmath35=0 since otherwise the convergence proved unreliable with so few data points .    turning to",
    "the role played by the neutron density distributions , it is evident from tables [ tab : res1 ] and [ tab : res2 ] that the dependence of the extracted parameters on the rms radius of the neutron density distribution must be taken into account in the evaluation of the final results .",
    "table [ tab : res3 ] summarizes the final values of @xmath6 , for @xmath46=1.25@xmath450.25  fm ( eq .",
    "( [ equ : rmf ] ) ) as discussed above .",
    "since one deals here with an _ average _ behaviour of @xmath42 along the periodic table , the effects of the uncertainty @xmath66 fm are included in quadrature . again all the different results for @xmath6 are consistent with each other , but only those due to global fits to 100 - 120 data points may be regarded as significantly different from the free @xmath1 value @xcite of @xmath3 . claiming such disagreement by analysing reduced data sets can only be described as unfounded .",
    "having demonstrated the dependence of the uncertainties of the derived values of @xmath6 on the size of the data base , we turn now to another problem which has affected recent derivations of this parameter @xcite , namely , the use of the seki - masutani ( sm ) linearization @xcite . in the sm scheme",
    "the re@xmath35 term which is quadratic in the densities is linearized with the help of an ` effective ' density such that the two terms with @xmath31 and re@xmath35 are lumped together into a single term @xmath67 .",
    "the existence of correlations between the parameters @xmath31 and re@xmath35 has been known for a long time @xcite and it can be seen also in tables [ tab : res1 ] and [ tab : res2 ] . however , the same tables show also that when large data bases are being used , then the value of each one of these two parameters is reasonably well determined , although not to a very good accuracy . in order to explicitly show the consequences of using the sm linearization we have repeated the fits reported in table [ tab : res1 ] with re@xmath35 set to zero .",
    "the results are summarized in table [ tab : res1a ] where it is seen that for the large data bases the values of @xmath58 have increased significantly .",
    "note that the ` natural ' unit for measuring these increases is @xmath60/f , the @xmath58 per degree of freedom .",
    "for the smaller data sets the increases are not statistically significant , in full agreement with the uncertainties for re@xmath35 quoted in tables [ tab : res1 ] and [ tab : res2 ] .",
    "it is concluded that the sm correlation is valid , as may be expected for any non - linear problem over some range of parameters , but when the quality of fit @xmath58 criteria are taken into consideration then the use of the sm linearization is unjustified and in the case of large data bases it biases the results .",
    "another interesting conclusion obtained from table [ tab : res1a ] is that when re@xmath35 is held fixed the values of @xmath6 and their uncertainties hardly change compared to the unrestricted analysis .",
    "the values of @xmath31 naturally change in order to compensate for the corresponding changes in re@xmath35 but the uncertainties of @xmath31 go down by almost an order of magnitude , which is unphysical . since the derivation of @xmath6 by geissel et al .",
    "@xcite is based on  @xmath68 constraints \" ( @xmath69 closely related to our @xmath31 ) , we conclude that the uncertainties of @xmath6 obtained in such limited analysis of deeply bound states , which is based on the sm linearization , are bound to be artificially small .",
    "in order to understand the role played by the deeply bound states in pionic atoms of @xmath8sn and of @xmath9pb in global fits , we compare values of @xmath60/n , the total @xmath58 per point obtained in the fits , with the corresponding values for the contribution of the deeply bound states . for the ` global 2 ' fit , using rmf - skin densities ( table [ tab : res1 ] ) , we have @xmath60/n=2.0 whereas the contribution of the deeply bound states amounts to 1.0 per point for these states . for the ` global 3 ' fit the numbers are 1.7 and 0.8 , respectively . removing the deeply bound states from the ` global 2 ' data and repeating the fit , we find @xmath60/n=2.0 and then using the resulting parameters to predict the shifts and widths of the deeply bound states , we get @xmath60/n=1.2 for these states .",
    "therefore in all three examples the @xmath60/n for the deeply bound states are smaller than the average , signifying that the deeply bound states do not depart from the picture obtained for normal pionic atoms along the periodic table . limiting the discussion to only 1@xmath0 states over the periodic table and confronting in table [",
    "tab : res3 ] the results for light nuclei only with the results for light @xmath65 nuclei plus the deeply bound states ( the latter subset was advocated in ref.@xcite ) , again it is concluded that the deeply bound states do not provide new information on the isovector @xmath0-wave amplitude @xmath6 .",
    "this observation is not entirely new and it was shown already in @xcite that the deeply bound states in @xmath70pb were in line with the expectations based on normal pionic atom data .",
    "a possible explanation was also indicated in ref .",
    "@xcite , namely ,  the same mechanism which causes the deeply bound states to be narrow also masks the deep interior of nuclei where new effects could possibly be observed \" .",
    "the fact that the deeply bound pionic atom states have failed to provide new information on the pion - nucleus interaction can be understood from simple arguments of overlap between the atomic wavefunction and the nucleus @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : overlap ] displays absolute values squared of the atomic radial wavefunctions multiplied by the nuclear density for a normal 1@xmath0 state ( in @xmath56ne ) and for a deeply bound 1@xmath0 state ( in @xmath71pb ) .",
    "it is seen that the coulomb wavefunction would have indeed penetrated deeply into the heavy pb nucleus , but due to the strong interaction it is repelled such that its overlap with the nucleus is sufficiently small to make the width of the state relatively narrow and thus making the state observable .",
    "in fact , the deeply bound 1@xmath0 wavefunction does not overlap with inner regions of the nucleus more so than a normal 1@xmath0 wavefunction does .",
    "this shows clearly why deeply bound states do not play any special role in the determination of pionic atom potentials .",
    "expanding the statement made in ref .",
    "@xcite we note that the same mechanism which causes the deeply bound states to be narrow and observable , namely , the strong repulsion @xcite of the wavefunction out of the nucleus , also masks the nuclear interior such that the penetration of the deeply bound pionic atom wavefunction is not dramatically enhanced compared to the normal states .",
    "in this work we have presented a comprehensive analysis of uncertainties for the parameters of the pion - nucleus optical potential which are extracted from experimental strong interaction effects in pionic atoms .",
    "emphasis was placed on the parameter @xmath6 , the isovector @xmath0-wave @xmath1 amplitude , which has been discussed widely in recent years in connection with possible medium modifications that could also explain the long - standing ` anomalous ' repulsion .",
    "in addition to errors which are inherent in the @xmath58 fit procedure , we have examined errors which are introduced because of the insufficient knowledge of neutron density distributions in nuclei , both in shape and in radial extent .",
    "the uncertainties involved in the use of partial data sets were compared with those obtained from global analyses of large amount of data covering all the periodic table .",
    "it was shown that only in the latter case the uncertainties are sufficiently small that a discrepancy between the value @xmath72 derived from pionic atoms and the corresponding value for the free @xmath1 interaction can be established .",
    "in particular , the deeply bound states do not provide sufficiently extensive and varied data base in order to constrain @xmath6 to the required precision .",
    "the failure of the deeply bound states to provide meaningful new information on the pion - nucleus interaction has been demonstrated and a simple explanation in terms of overlap arguments was offered .",
    "finally , we mention weise s suggestion for a density dependence of @xmath6 motivated by a partial restoration of chiral symmetry in dense matter @xcite .",
    "its application was shown @xcite to remove most of the anomaly when applied to large data sets . updating the fit termed ` w ' in @xcite for the present analysis of the 120 data points and including also the uncertainties due to the neutron densities , we find the following low - density limit values : @xmath73 and @xmath74 , in full agreement with the free @xmath1 values @xcite of @xmath75 and @xmath3 .",
    "the parameter re@xmath35 assumes then the value @xmath76 , which is most acceptable ( see ref .",
    "although successful on a phenomenological level , this approach has been deemed controversial .",
    "for example , chanfray et al .",
    "@xcite have recently discussed the additional medium effect of a @xmath77 field on the renormalization of the pion field in dense matter , finding a considerably smaller renormalization effect than that suggested by weise . on the other hand , kolomeitsev et al .",
    "@xcite have argued that weise s fairly substantial renormalization effect can be derived by considering the energy dependence of @xmath78 within a systematic chiral perturbation expansion and enforcing consistently gauge invariance .",
