    "we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of surface electromagnetic modes measured by using the pump - probe correlation spectroscopy of the transmission bands in 2d subwavelength hole array on aluminum ( al ) thin film .",
    "we found significant difference with the dynamics observed previously in smooth metal films ( mostly gold and silver ) in both the time - resolved and spectrally - resolved signals . following an instantaneous rise at the onset of the impinging pulse , the transient differential transmission exhibits a fast rise on subpicosecond timescale followed by a plateau for time delays of 1 - 3 ps , and subsequent slow decay with characteristic time of @xmath3 ps .",

    "the observed dynamics can be explained by a fast energy transfer in the al film from the electron gas to the lattice , with subsequent cooling of the al film by heat transfer to the glass substrate .",
    "the fast lattice temperature rise is caused by strong electron - phonon interaction in al , which makes the electron - lattice energy transfer rate comparable to the rate of nonequilibrium electrons thermalization via electron - electron interactions@xcite .",
