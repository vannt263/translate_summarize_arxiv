    "the luminosity function of galaxies is the number density of galaxies as a function of absolute magnitude .",
    "the shape of the luminosity function can be used to constrain galaxy formation models .",
    "the luminosity function is often described by three numbers : @xmath17 , the magnitude at which the number of bright galaxies rapidly decreases ; @xmath18 , the space density at @xmath17 , and the faint end slope @xmath19 which characterizes the ratio of dwarf galaxies to giant galaxies .",
    "models of galaxy formation and evolution must be able to account for these parameters , which vary with galaxy type . over the past few years",
    ", the luminosity function of high redshift ( @xmath20 ) galaxies have been studied extensively through the use of deep , wide - area surveys .",
    "some of the more notable efforts include the canada - france redshift survey ( cfrs , lilly et al .",
    "1995 ) , the canadian network for observational cosmology field galaxy redshift survey ( cnoc2 , lin et al 1999 ) , the calar alto deep imaging survey ( cadis , fried et al . 2001 ) , the deep groth strip survey ( dgss , i m et al .",
    "2002 ) , the subaru deep survey ( kashikawa et al . 2003 ) , the classifying objects by medium band observations ( combo-17 , wolf et al . 2003 ) and from a combination of hubble space telescope ( hst ) and very large telescope ( vlt ) images , poli et al .",
    "most of these use deep , ground - based images with spectroscopic or photometric redshifts to construct the luminosity function , but do not have the spatial resolution to measure the structural properties of galaxies at higher redshifts .    without information on the structural properties ,",
    "ground - based surveys have resorted to using color information as a proxy for morphologies , whether this information comes in the form of a best - fit spectral energy distribution ( e.g. wolf et al .",
    "2003 ) , or a rest - frame color cut ( e.g. lilly et al .",
    "this can result in apparent discrepant results .",
    "for example , wolf et al .",
    "( 2003 ) found that the elliptical / s0 ( e / s0 ) galaxies that produce @xmath21 cent of the current b - band luminosity density only contributed @xmath22 at @xmath23 .",
    "by contrast , using morphological classification , van den bergh ( 2001 ) found that the fraction of elliptical galaxies has remained constant at @xmath24 , @xmath25 , implying that either the luminosity of ellipticals has increased over time relative to other types of galaxies or that the differences in color - selection and morphological - selection have produced apparently inconsistent results between these surveys .",
    "surveys using the hubble space telescope ( hst ) such as the dgss ( i m et al .",
    "2002 ; simard et al . 2002 ) and the medium deep survey ( griffiths et al .",
    "1994 ) have been able to reliably morphologically classify and measure structural parameters for galaxies with @xmath26 mag , but over much smaller areas of sky than the deep ground based surveys .",
    "these hst surveys have discovered a population of @xmath27 blue e / s0 galaxies ( e.g. menanteau et al .",
    "1999 , i m et al .",
    "2001 , gebhardt et al .",
    "2003 ) that have similar luminosities to standard red e / s0 galaxies .",
    "i m et al .",
    "( 2001 ) find these make up @xmath28 of the e / s0 sample whereas menanteau et al .",
    "( 1999 ) find a much higher fraction : @xmath29 of the sample .",
    "objects such as these demonstrate the inherent weakness of using color as a proxy for morphology . at low redshifts , almost all of the bright",
    "e / s0 galaxies are red , with blue ellipticals ( dwarf ellipticals ) many magnitudes fainter . from the work of menanteau et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and i m et al .",
    "( 2001 ) it appears that most of these blue e / s0 galaxies have blue cores and red exteriors , with the exteriors having the same colors as red e / s0 galaxies , which have constant colors at all radii .",
    "i m et al .",
    "( 2001 ) concluded that these blue e / s0 galaxies were less massive than the red e / s0 galaxies based on the dynamical masses calculated from the velocity dispersions . however , because the velocity dispersions were measured much closer to the core of the galaxy for the low redshift red ellipticals , the high redshift blue ellipticals may be more massive than the measurements suggest .",
    "even if the measurements give accurate dynamical masses , the blue e / s0 galaxies have masses equivalent to the lower mass red e / s0s , so they may still yet evolve into high mass red e / s0s through a combination of luminosity evolution that reddens the stellar population over time and mergers that increase the mass .",
    "luminosity evolution occurs when there is new star - formation , or when the stellar population ages , and does not necessarily imply any change in the mass or number of stars in a galaxy .",
    "structural parameters such as the size and shape are better indicators of the morphological evolution , since they are only weakly dependent on the age of the stellar population and are mainly determined by dynamical characteristics such as total mass and angular momentum . within the half - light radius of a giant elliptical galaxy",
    "the dynamical time - scale is very short , less than @xmath30 years , so dynamical equilibrium is reached very quickly . the size and shape of the galaxy will not change significantly unless mass is added via mergers or accretion ; a close encounter changes the angular momentum ; tidal forces disrupt the outer layers .",
    "small changes in the apparent shape and size do occur when star - formation is localized in the center , in bars , rings or spiral arms , but these are much weaker changes than the variation in sed or color . therefore morphology is a more robust indicator of the nature of a galaxy , but it requires good resolution to use .",
    "previous studies have differed in the way they have utilized size information to make inferences about evolution .",
    "several surveys have assumed that galaxy size and shape are constant with redshift .",
    "schade , barrientos & lopez - cruz ( 1997 ) showed that cluster ellipticals evolve as @xmath31 , assuming they maintain a constant size , and schade et al .",
    "( 1999 ) demonstrated that field ellipticals show a similar evolution . using a sample of 44 galaxies with @xmath32 roche et al .",
    "( 1998 ) discovered that ellipticals show significant luminosity evolution but little size evolution from @xmath1 to @xmath33 .",
    "they found that most size evolution appears to happen at @xmath34 .",
    "graham ( 2002 ) compared the scatter in the ` photometric plane ' which only requires parameters measured from galaxy images , to the scatter in the ` fundamental plane ' which requires dispersion velocities measured from high resolution spectra .",
    "graham showed that the photometric plane could be used to constrain distances to elliptical galaxies .    in cross",
    "et al . ( 2001 ) and cross & driver ( 2002 ) , the effects of surface brightness selection on the @xmath35 galaxy luminosity function were discussed . in this paper",
    "we look at the lf of morphological early types at @xmath36 .",
    "we then examine the effect that color selection has on this luminosity function .",
    "finally , we use structural parameters to test whether blue e / s0 galaxies are progenitors of red e / s0 galaxies and what evolution has taken place from @xmath23 to @xmath0 .    the advanced camera for surveys ( acs , ford et al .",
    "2002 ) significantly improves on wfpc2 in terms of sensitivity ( a factor of 5 ) , field of view ( a factor of 2 ) and resolution ( a factor of 2 ) , giving well sampled psfs in the i and z bands .",
    "this leads to significant improvements in both the accuracy of the size measurements and the overall sample size .    in this paper",
    "we use data from 5 fields observed as part of the acs gto program .",
    "the total area is over 8 times the hdfn .",
    "these fields were selected to observe very nearby ( @xmath37 ) galaxies or very distant ( @xmath38 ) galaxies , so galaxies in the redshift range @xmath39 should be representative of the universe at that redshift .",
    "the fields are in various parts of the sky , sampling a large volume in each redshift range ( @xmath40 mpc@xmath41 @xmath5 and @xmath42 mpc@xmath41 @xmath8 ) so the effects of cosmic variance should be much smaller than in the hubble deep fields .",
    "in fact , the relative independence of our fields makes this survey more competitive with larger surveys than one might think based upon the areal coverage alone .",

    "<S> we measure the luminosity function of morphologically selected e / s0 galaxies from @xmath0 to @xmath1 using deep high resolution advanced camera for surveys imaging data . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis covers an area of @xmath2 ( 8@xmath3 the area of the hdf - n ) and extends 2 magnitudes deeper ( @xmath4 mag ) than was possible in the deep groth strip survey ( dgss ) . </S>",
    "<S> our fields were observed as part of the acs guaranteed time observations . at @xmath5 , we find @xmath6 and @xmath7 , and at @xmath8 , we find @xmath9 , consistent with 0.3 magnitudes of luminosity evolution ( from @xmath5 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these luminosity functions are similar in both shape and number density to the luminosity function using morphological selection ( e.g. , dgss ) , but are much steeper than the luminosity functions of samples selected using morphological proxies like the color or spectral energy distribution ( e.g. , cfrs , cadis , or combo-17 ) . the difference is due to the ` blue ' , @xmath10 , e / s0 galaxies , which make up to @xmath11 of the sample at all magnitudes and an increasing proportion of faint galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we thereby demonstrate the need for _ both morphological and structural information _ to constrain the evolution of galaxies .    </S>",
    "<S> we find that the ` blue ' e / s0 galaxies have the same average sizes and sersic parameters as the ` red ' , @xmath12 , e / s0 galaxies at brighter luminosities ( @xmath13 ) , but are increasingly different at fainter magnitudes where ` blue ' galaxies are both smaller and have lower sersic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we find differences in both the size - magnitude relation and the photometric plane offset for ` red ' and ` blue ' e / s0s , although neither ` red ' nor ` blue ' galaxies give a good fit to the size magnitude relation . </S>",
    "<S> fits of the colors to stellar population models suggest that most e / s0 galaxies have short star - formation time scales ( @xmath14 gyr ) , and that galaxies have formed at an increasing rate from @xmath15 until @xmath16 after which there has been a gradual decline . </S>"
