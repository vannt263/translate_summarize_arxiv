    "recent _ chandra _ observations indicate that relativistic plasma injected into the intracluster medium ( icm ) from radio sources eventually detaches from the radio source , forming bubbles of radio plasma in the icm @xcite . in the model proposed by @xcite ,",
    "these radio ghosts survive in the icm , and provide a seed population of cosmic rays(crs ) .",
    "diffuse non - thermal ( nt ) emission is produced when merger induced shocks re - accelerate , via the first order fermi process , this seed cr population .",
    "current evidence suggests that these radio ghosts contain a significant population of protons as well as electrons @xcite .",
    "since @xcite demonstrated that diffuse nt x - ray emission could be produced by either primary electrons directly accelerated at shock fronts , or secondary electrons produced during proton - proton collisions , there are two possible sources for the observed diffuse nt emission . to determine the mechanism that produces diffuse nt emission requires accurate measurement of the spectrum and location of the nt emission .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that diffuse nt emission occurs in a broad mass range of clusters with a luminosity proportional to the x - ray temperature , making cool clusters and groups an important diagnostic for understanding which population of electrons produces diffuse nt emission . they find that spectral index of the diffuse nt emission is dependent on the electron population producing the emission , such that the spectral index of diffuse nt emission produced from primary electrons has a steep spectral index ( @xmath71.1 ) , while for secondary it is systematically flatter ( @xmath81.1 ) .",
    "@xcite reported detection of diffuse nt x - ray and radio emission from ic1262 , a poor cluster of galaxies .",
    "the x - ray detection was made using the _ bepposax _ medium energy concentrator spectrometer ( mecs ) detector , and the radio using the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) and westerbork northern sky survey ( wenss ) .",
    "although the mecs was able to constrain the region of the nt emission , it does not have the spatial resolution to identify the source of the nt emission . in this paper , we show that the _ chandra _ advanced ccd imaging spectrometer ( acis ) has the energy range and spatial capability to detect , localize , and characterize the spectrum of nt x - ray emission from low temperature clusters .",
    "these results are compared to simulations of cosmic - ray acceleration at shock fronts .    throughout this letter , we assume a hubble constant of h@xmath9 = 65 _ h@xmath10 _ km s@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 and q@xmath9 = @xmath11 .",
    "quoted confidence intervals are at a 90% level , unless otherwise specified .",

    "exposure maps were created for 17 different energy bands to ensure proper exposure correction .",
    "background was taken from the caldb 2.21 blank - sky datasets .        to construct the temperature map ( see figure-[fig3 ] ) we divided the chip into quadrants , north , south , east , and west .",
    "spectra were extracted from pie shaped regions with radii differences such that there were at least 20000 counts in each region . in order to ensure proper background subtraction , we eliminated periods of high background , following the _ filtering lightcurves _ thread . in order to account for background variability ,",
    "the background was normalized to the source in the 10 - 12 kev range @xcite .",
    "the data were grouped so that there were at least 30 counts per channel .",

    "from the flux and hardness map , figure-[fig1 ] and figure-[fig2 ] respectively , we chose four regions that have a strong gradient in flux and hardness .",
    "these regions are shown in figure-[fig1 ] .",
    "we considered four models of background subtraction , to ensure any nt detection would not be the result of undersubtracted particle background .",
    "these four background subtraction techniques were : ( 1 ) standard blank - sky fields extracted from the same region on the s3 chip as the source and normalizing in the 10 - 12 kev range as described in @xcite , ( 2 ) extracting a region far to the north of the peak flux , modeling it and then using the model times a free constant in our source + background spectrum modeling , ( 3 ) freezing the background model described in ( 2 ) with a constant proportional to the difference in size of the source and background region , and ( 4 ) subtracting the size normalized background spectrum from the source spectrum . in all cases",
    "the source model parameters are consistent within 90% confidence , indicating that all four methods produce the same results .",
    "we modeled our four `` possible shock '' regions with a single thermal component model , a double component thermal model , and a thermal model with powerlaw .",
    "the addition of the powerlaw component does not significantly improve the fit in the east and west regions .",
    "in addition , figure-[fig4 ] shows that a thermal model fits the entire spectrum in the east region . in the case of the north region , adding either a second thermal component , or a power - law component improves the fit .",
    "the single thermal model fit to the south region has clear high end residuals ( see figure-[fig4 ] ) .",
    "although the addition of a second second thermal component improves the fit ( @xmath65 16 for a reduction of 2 degrees of freedom(dof ) ) , the addition of a powerlaw component provides the best fit ( @xmath65 23 for a reduction of 2 dof ) and reduces the residuals ( see figure [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "although we can not rule out a thermal interpretation of the second component , we argue a non - thermal interpretation is better statistically and physically .",
    "the addition of a powerlaw ( 37% probability of exceeding @xmath66 = 74 for 71 dof ) produces a better fit than adding a second thermal component ( 18% probability of exceeding @xmath67 for the 71 dof ) .",
    "the 90% lower confidence of @xmath57 kev implies a shock with a mach number of @xmath53 , which is higher than observed in clusters ( * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    in order to confirm that the nonthermal detection was not simply undersubtracted particle background , we repeated our four different techniques for handling the background that we had done for a single thermal model .",
    "as in the case with the single thermal model , the results are consistent within 90% for all the background techniques used ( see table-[tbl-2 ] ) . also , we point out that the lack of a nt detection in the west and east regions provides more evidence that the detection in the north and south regions is not simply particle background , since that would be observed isotropically across the detector .        lcccccc north + & blank - sky & 1.32@xmath68 & @xmath69 & 2.36@xmath70 & 0.79@xmath71 & 52.93678/50 + & model - bkg & 1.29@xmath72 & @xmath73 & 2.30@xmath74 & 0.78@xmath75 & 54.05200/49 + & model - bkg(frzn ) & 1.31@xmath23 & 0.39@xmath76 & 2.41@xmath77 & 0.56@xmath78 & 57.22508/50 + & -local region & 1.30@xmath23 & 0.43@xmath79 & 2.40@xmath80 & 0.58@xmath81 & 54.61599/50 +   + south + & blank - sky & 1.44@xmath82 & @xmath83 & 2.21@xmath1 & 0.95@xmath84 & 74.33978/71 + & model - bkg & 1.40@xmath85 & @xmath83 & 2.14@xmath86 & 0.91@xmath87 & 77.66279/70 + & model - bkg(frzn ) & 1.44@xmath88 & 0.49@xmath89 & 2.33@xmath90 & 0.59@xmath91 & 90.72980/71 + & -local region & 1.43@xmath92 & @xmath93 & 2.27@xmath94 & 0.78@xmath95 & 76.28895/71 +    the radio halo detected by @xcite appears to extend to the south along the elongated x - ray isophotes and through the south region ( see figure-[fig5 ] ) .",
    "however the @xmath51@xmath6.0 resolution of the nvss and wenss precludes the removal of radio point sources .",
    "we , therefore , consider two possibilities : ( 1 ) that the extended southern radio emission is dominated by radio point sources , and ( 2 ) that it is diffuse radio emission . in the case that the radio emission is dominated by radio point sources , we argue that this would have no affect on our x - ray results .",
    "relativistic electrons diffusing from a point source at their alfvn speed , would only reach @xmath96 h@xmath17 kpc ( @xmath97 ) ( assuming a 1 @xmath98 g magnetic field ) in their radiative lifetime ( @xmath510@xmath99 years ) .",
    "therefore any radio point source with detectable x - ray emission would appear point - like and would have been removed from the _ chandra acis _",
    "data . in the latter case ,",
    "the diffuse radio emission is emitted by the same electrons producing the inverse compton emission ( as in the inverse compton scattering - syntrotron model @xcite ) .",
    "we also note in passing that there are several identified radio point sources ( including the cd galaxy ) in ic1262 , which could provide the seed population of crs necessary in the model proposed by @xcite .",
    "a comparison of figure-[fig1 ] and figure-[fig2 ] to flux and temperature maps created from simulations of cluster mergers done by @xcite and @xcite , indicates a recent ( @xmath50.25 - 1 gyr ago ) north - south merger of a smaller subclump ( mass ratio @xmath51:2 - 1:4 ) with ic1262 .",
    "these simulations show the general characteristics of the temperature and morphological structure : elongation of the isophotes to the south , compression to the north , and the hottest gas south of the center .",
    "since cd galaxies in relaxed systems will reside at the bottom of the potential well ( e.g. @xcite ) , the offset of cd galaxy from the x - ray peak and its high peculiar velocity ( @xmath100v = 453 km s@xmath4 ) provide additional evidence of a merger .",
    "the kick to initiate sloshing is parallel to the impact parameter @xcite .",
    "as the simulations indicate a recent collision , the subclump must have passed to the west , pulling the cd galaxy to the west .",
    "the elongation of the x - ray isophotes toward the south that overlap the diffuse radio emission open up the possibility that the elongation is due to non - thermal emission rather than a merger .",
    "however , the evidence for a merger comes not only from the similarity of the southern x - ray isophotes to those seen in the simulations cited above , but also from the compressed northern x - ray isophotes and the very hot region that is south of center .    comparing our results with the simulations done by @xcite , we argue that the localized diffuse nt emission is from a population of primary electrons .",
    "@xcite find that primary electron reacceleration follows the shock region closely . in the central region",
    "( r @xmath101 0.3 mpc ) , they find the greatest difference between the spectral index produced from primary electrons ( @xmath1021.1 ) and secondary electrons ( @xmath81.1 ) .",
    "our 90% confidence photon index @xmath0 = 2.07 - 2.36 which corresponds to a spectral index @xmath103 = 1.07 - 1.36 is consistent with the spectral index that @xcite found for primary electrons . using the best fit f@xmath104-t@xmath105 of @xcite",
    ", we find a flux of ( 10 - 48 ) @xmath106 10@xmath107 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 over 0.13 to 100 kev for primary electrons in a 1.94 kev cluster ( ic1262 s temperature as determined by @xcite ) . the range fluxes depends on the r@xmath108 , the ratio of electrons to protons at relativistic energies .",
    "using the same energy range and cluster temperature we find that secondary electrons produce a flux of 1.9 @xmath106 10@xmath107 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 .",
    "for our best fit photon index @xmath0 = 2.21 and 90% confidence normalization range of 7.0 - 11.1 @xmath106 10@xmath109 photons @xmath3 s@xmath4 kev@xmath4 at 1 kev , we determine a flux of ( 6 - 10 ) @xmath106 10@xmath107 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath4 for the 0.13 - 100 kev range .",
    "this result has a lower limit 3@xmath106 greater than the results predicted for flux from secondary electrons .",
    "although the 90% upper confidence limit is barely consistent with the primary electron model ( suggesting r@xmath110 0.01 ) , we point out that the results of @xcite is for shocks over the entire cluster , and our detection is only for a fraction of the cluster .",
    "that is the total non - thermal emission from cluster is probably greater than our detection , further strengthening the argument that the flux is too high to come from secondary electrons ."
