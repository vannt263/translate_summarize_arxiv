    "<S> the quasielastic scattering of muon neutrinos on oxygen 16 is studied for neutrino energies between 200 mev and 1 gev using a relativistic shell model . </S>",
    "<S> final state interactions are included within the distorted wave impulse approximation , by means of a relativistic optical potential , with and without imaginary part , and of a relativistic mean field potential . for comparison with experimental data the inclusive </S>",
    "<S> charged  current quasielastic cross section for @xmath0@xmath1 scattering in the kinematical conditions of the lsnd experiment at los alamos is also presented and briefly discussed .    in the past few years the observation of neutrino oscillations at super  </S>",
    "<S> kamiokande  @xcite and the subsequent proposal and realization of new experiments , aimed at determining neutrino properties with high accuracy  @xcite , have renovated the interest towards neutrino scattering on complex nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , neutrino detectors usually contain carbon or oxygen nuclei , and for a proper interpretation of the experimental results the description of the @xmath2nucleus interaction must be accurate  @xcite .    at intermediate neutrino energies , ranging from some hundreds mev to a few gev , @xmath2nucleus quasielastic scattering has been studied within several approaches  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> relativistic and non relativistic studies of random phase approximation have shown nuclear structure effects to be relevant only at low momentum transfers , but indications have been found that for future and precise data analyses of , e.g. , atmospheric neutrino measurements , more accurate theoretical estimates may be needed . additionally , very recently new attention has been drawn towards final state interaction ( fsi ) effects , which , contrary to what is often assumed , may still be relevant even at the relatively high energy @xmath3 gev  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> in this contribution we study charged  current ( cc ) neutrino  nucleus quasielastic scattering within the framework of a relativistic shell model ( rsm ) , already successfully employed to study exclusive electron scattering  @xcite and neutral current neutrino scattering  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we compute inclusive @xmath0@xmath4 quasielastic cross sections for three values of the incident neutrino energy , namely @xmath5 mev , @xmath6 mev , and @xmath7 gev , which are representative of the kinematical range where quasielastic scattering gives the main contribution to the inclusive @xmath2nucleus process .    </S>",
    "<S> we describe the cc quasielastic scattering of neutrinos on a nuclear target within the impulse approximation ( ia ) , assuming that the incident neutrino exchanges one vector boson with only one nucleon , which is then emitted , while the remaining ( a-1 ) nucleons in the target are spectators . the nuclear current is assumed to be the sum of single nucleon currents , for which we employ the usual free nucleon expression ( see  @xcite ) with the axial form factor parameterized as a dipole with cut  off mass @xmath8 gev  @xcite , and the states of the target and residual nuclei to be adequately described by an independent particle model wave function .    to describe the bound nucleon states we use relativistic shell model wave functions , obtained as the self  consistent ( hartree ) solutions of a dirac equation , derived , within a relativistic mean field approach , from a lagrangian containing @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 mesons  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as the single - particle binding energies determine the threshold of the cross section for every shell , in the numerical calculations , we have used the experimental values corresponding to the binding energies of the different shells .    for the outgoing nucleon </S>",
    "<S> the simplest choice is to use plane wave spinors , i.e. , no interaction is considered between the ejected nucleon and the residual nucleus ( pwia ) . for a more realistic description , </S>",
    "<S> fsi effects should be taken into account . in our formalism </S>",
    "<S> this is done by using distorted waves which are given as solutions of a dirac equation containing a phenomenological relativistic optical potential ( rop ) , consisting of a real part , which describes the rescattering of the ejected nucleon and of an imaginary part , that accounts for the absorption of it into unobserved channels . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we use the rop corresponding to the edad-1 single - nucleon parameterization presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the use of this phenomenological rop leads to an excellent agreement between theoretical calculations and data for exclusive @xmath12 observables  @xcite ; however some caution should be taken in extending the conclusions drawn from the analysis of exclusive reactions to inclusive ones . in the latter , unless a selection of the single nucleon knockout contribution is experimentally feasible , all final channels are included and thus the imaginary term in the optical potential leads to an overestimation of fsi effects . </S>",
    "<S> this is clearly illustrated in fig .  1 where we compare our theoretical results with the experimental cross section corresponding to inclusive quasielastic electron scattering on @xmath1 for a momentum transfer equal to 400 mev / c ( similar results are obtained for 300 and 500 mev / c ) . in our calculation </S>",
    "<S> besides the complex rop , we also consider the potential obtained by setting the imaginary part of the rop to zero . </S>",
    "<S> additionally one may also use distorted waves which are obtained as the solutions in the continuum of the same dirac equation used to describe the initial bound nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> we refer to this approach , that should be adequate to describe fsi at moderate energy transfer , as relativistic mean field ( rmf ) . as shown in fig .  1 , the complex rop results clearly underestimate the data , while the reverse occurs for the pwia calculation . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the rmf and purely real rop agree much better with experiment , particularly rmf for small transfer energy and real rop for higher @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we believe that the rmf and real rop results indicate a reasonable `` band '' where fsi effects should lie .     versus the outgoing muon kinetic energy , for the quasielastic scattering of muon neutrinos on @xmath4 and for three choices of the incident neutrino energy : @xmath13 mev ( upper panel ) , @xmath6 mev ( middle ) and @xmath7 gev ( lower panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> the solid curves correspond to the rsm with no final state interaction , while the remaining curves are calculated within the rfg , with @xmath14 mev and @xmath15 ( dot  dashed ) and @xmath16 mev ( dotted).,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    let us now present our results for neutrino scattering on @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> to better illustrate our model , we start by neglecting fsi and comparing rsm  pwia results with inclusive cross sections obtained within the relativistic fermi gas ( rfg )  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is is done in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : o16_dsig_pwia ] , which shows the differential cross section @xmath17 as a function of the outgoing muon kinetic energy . with respect to the rfg curve calculated with no binding energy </S>",
    "<S> we observe that the rsm cross section is reduced and shifted towards lower @xmath18 values , in a way which is similar to the effect of an average binding energy in the rfg . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the rsm cross section has a different shape , due to the different momentum distributions of the single nucleon shells contributing to the process . since the various shells have different binding energies , the corresponding contributions to the cross section go to zero at different values of @xmath18 and this gives rise to the structure of @xmath19 observed at large @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : o16_dsig_pwia ] shows that nuclear model effects on the cross sections can be rather large at low neutrino energy , but become less relevant as @xmath20 increases , practically disappearing at @xmath21 gev .    , but including fsi effects . </S>",
    "<S> all curves are calculated within the rsm model in pwia ( solid ) , and within the rmf ( dashed ) , real rop ( dotted ) and complex rop ( dot  dashed ) approaches . </S>",
    "<S> , scaledwidth=60.0% ]    on the other hand , the behavior of fsi effects is quite different , as illustrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : o16_dsig_fsi ] . here the results obtained with the rsm in pwia </S>",
    "<S> are compared with the cases where fsi are described within the rmf , the real rop and the complex rop approaches . </S>",
    "<S> the use of real potentials ( rmf and real rop ) for describing the final nucleon states leads to the resonant structure observed for relatively high @xmath18 ( that is , small energy transfer @xmath10 ) . </S>",
    "<S> note that in this work we only include single - particle excitations within a mean field picture . including residual interactions </S>",
    "<S> would make the width and number of resonances to be considerably larger .    </S>",
    "<S> we observe that fsi effects produce a reduction of the cross section , particularly important in the case of the complex rop model due to the absorption introduced by the imaginary term : about 60% for @xmath13 mev and 50% for @xmath22 mev and @xmath3 gev in the region close to the maximum . </S>",
    "<S> for the rmf and real rop , the reduction , similar in both cases , is about @xmath23 for @xmath24 mev and @xmath25 for the other energy values .     for the quasielastic scattering of muon neutrinos on @xmath4 as a function of the incident neutrino energy . </S>",
    "<S> the curves are calculated within the rfg model with @xmath26 mev and binding energy @xmath15 ( solid line ) and @xmath27 mev ( dashed ) . </S>",
    "<S> the points correspond to rsm calculations without fsi ( stars ) and with fsi effects taken into account within the rmf ( empty squares ) , real rop ( full squares ) and complex rop ( circles ) approaches.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    nuclear model effects on integrated cross sections are studied in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : o16_tot ] , where the cross section @xmath28 is plotted as a function of the incident neutrino energy . here </S>",
    "<S> the contributions coming from the rmf and rop resonances have been included in the calculation , in order to respect the completeness of the set of final states predicted by the model . </S>",
    "<S> these contributions are important at @xmath13 mev , where they amount to about 10% of the integrated cross section , while at higher energies these effects are about 2% ( 500 mev ) and 1% ( 1 gev ) . </S>",
    "<S> again we see that within the pwia the discrepancy between different nuclear models is relatively small and decreases with increasing neutrino energy . on the contrary fsi effects </S>",
    "<S> remain sizeable even at large @xmath20 . as in the previous figure , </S>",
    "<S> the imaginary term in the rop leads to a too large reduction ( @xmath29 ) of the integrated cross section . </S>",
    "<S> the results for the rmf and real rop models , which are more reliable , show a smaller , but still sizeable ( @xmath30 at @xmath3 gev ) reduction .    </S>",
    "<S> the results shown in figs .  [ fig : o16_dsig_fsi ] and [ fig : o16_tot ] lead us to conclude that fsi effects should be carefully considered in neutrino experiments which use oxygen based detectors . </S>",
    "<S> analogous conclusions can be drawn for the case of a @xmath1 target .    </S>",
    "<S> for the purpose of comparison with the experiment , let us consider the inclusive @xmath31 cross section measured by the lsnd collaboration at los alamos , using a pion  decay  in  flight @xmath0 beam , with energies ranging from muon threshold to 300 mev , and a large liquid scintillator detector  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this experiment has been compared to very different theoretical approaches  @xcite , but an important discrepancy still remains . </S>",
    "<S> although at these low energies processes different from the quasielastic nucleon knockout affect the inclusive cross section , we consider our fsi approach to be useful to estimate integrated cross sections .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : dsigexp ] we show the observed  @xcite and calculated distribution of events , averaged over the 1994 los alamos neutrino spectrum @xmath32 within the energy range @xmath33 mev . </S>",
    "<S> the shape and position of the maximum of the experimental distribution are approximately reproduced by the three calculations , but the results that include fsi with the rmf potential are clearly favored by the data . </S>",
    "<S> this is consistent with the fact that including fsi with the mean field potential should be adequate at moderate kinetic energy of the ejected nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> however the values we obtain for the the flux  averaged integrated cross section overestimate the measured cross section by approximately 50% . more precisely , in the rsm , we obtain @xmath34 ( pwia ) , @xmath35 ( rmf ) and @xmath36 ( real rop ) @xmath37 @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> additional corrections due to the outgoing muon coulomb distortion , evaluated within the effective momentum approximation  @xcite , further increase these numbers by @xmath39 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding final measured experimental value is @xmath40 @xmath37 @xmath38  @xcite . </S>"
