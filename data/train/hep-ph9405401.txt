    "the rapid advance of laser technology makes possible the collision of high - brightness , high - energy photon beams at future linear colliders @xcite through compton backscattering @xcite .",
    "one particularly intriguing use of such a photon linear collider is to measure the two - photon decay width of a higgs boson once it is discovered @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 width of a higgs boson is potentially one of its most important properties .",
    "the coupling of the higgs to two photons proceeds through loops in which any charged particle with couplings to the higgs contributes .",
    "a measurement of the @xmath6 width is thus quite sensitive to new physics at even higher mass scales @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric models , technicolor models , and other extensions of the standard model with more complicated higgs sectors all predict two - photon couplings which are , in general , very different from that of the standard model @xcite .    in a photon linear collider ,",
    "the @xmath6 partial width of a higgs boson , @xmath7 , is deduced by measuring the higgs production cross section in the reaction @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the detected final state .",
    "the number of detected events is proportional to the product @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the branching ratio of the higgs boson into the detected final state @xmath9 .",
    "measuring the production cross section then determines this product .",
    "an independent measurement of the branching ratio , say at an @xmath12 collider in the process @xmath13 , then allows a determination of the @xmath6 partial width .",
    "for a higgs boson in the intermediate - mass region , 50  gev @xmath14 150  gev , the dominant decay mode is to @xmath15 .",
    "measurement of the two - photon partial width of the higgs in this mass region requires suppressing the continuum @xmath16 background beneath the resonant @xmath17 signal , assuming light quarks can be distinguished from heavy quarks by vertexing @xcite .",
    "the continuum background can be greatly suppressed by using polarized photon beams .",
    "the higgs signal is produced by photons in a @xmath18 initial state , whereas the continuum backgrounds are primarily produced by photons in the @xmath19 initial state , the @xmath18 cross section being suppressed for large angles by a factor of @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the @xmath2 suppression of the @xmath18 @xmath20 cross section is in principle removed by the presence of an additional gluon in the final state .",
    "it follows that @xmath21 with @xmath22 could be a significant background for higgs detection .",
    "this process can mimic a two - jet event ( the dominant signal topology ) in two important ways : ( i ) if two of the three partons are collinear , for example a fast quark recoiling against a collinear quark and gluon , or ( ii ) if one of the three partons is either quite soft or is directed down the beampipe and is therefore not tagged as a distinct jet .",
    "a particularly interesting example of the latter is when one of the incoming photons splits into a quark and an antiquark , one of which carries most of the photon s momentum and compton scatters off the other photon , @xmath23 .",
    "two jets are then identified in the detector , with the third jet remaining undetected .    in this paper",
    "we study the impact of the radiative @xmath24 production process on the study of an intermediate - mass higgs boson at a photon linear collider .",
    "we first describe the calculation of the matrix element and discuss the various configurations which could be tagged as two - jet events . in section 3",
    ", we perform a detailed experimental simulation and compare the resulting background cross sections with those expected from higgs production .",
    "finally , our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "for higgs bosons in the intermediate - mass region , the beam energy spread of a @xmath6 collider is much greater than the total width of the higgs boson , and so the number of @xmath25 events expected is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the two - photon invariant mass .",

    "this is equivalent , for the purposes of comparison , to assuming that the experimental resolution on reconstructing the higgs mass is 10  gev .",

    "because of helicity conservation at the photon vertices , only amplitudes with opposite helicities for the quark and antiquark survive .",
    "however , the combined impact of @xmath46- , @xmath47- and @xmath48-invariance , photon bose statistics , and unitarity , can be shown to lead to a vanishing amplitude in this limit _ at lowest order in perturbation theory_. it follows that all interferences between the born and higher - order non - radiative diagrams also vanish for the @xmath3 case .",
    "in fact for the special case of scattering at angle @xmath49 , the vanishing of _ all _ @xmath3 non - radiative amplitudes ( i.e. not just at leading order ) follows simply from rotational invariance about the fermion direction and photon bose statistics . for this particular angular configuration",

    "@xcite with regard to higgs physics in @xmath6 collisions . with highly polarized beams ,",
    "such backgrounds are found to be small and do not hinder the study of an intermediate - mass higgs boson at a @xmath6 collider .",
    "this raises the question of whether previously ignored backgrounds could in fact be dominant , or at least could contribute significantly .    while the lowest order @xmath43 large - angle cross sections are @xmath50 and @xmath51 for @xmath52 and @xmath53 , respectively , the @xmath24 cross sections are @xmath54 in both cases , i.e. the @xmath21 cross section is in principle _ not _ suppressed in the @xmath18 channel at high energies as is the non - radiative cross section . furthermore ,",
