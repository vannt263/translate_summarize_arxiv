    "characterizing the capacity of cellular networks is one of the fundamental problems in network information theory .",
    "unfortunately , even for the simplest setting consisting of two base stations ( bss ) having one serving user each , which is referred to as the two - user interference channel ( ic ) , capacity is not completely characterized for general channel parameters @xcite .",
    "exact capacity results being notoriously difficult to obtain , many researchers have recently studied approximate capacity characterizations in the shape of so - called `` degrees of freedom ( dof ) '' , which captures the behavior of capacity as the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) becomes large .    the dof metric has received a great deal of attention and thoroughly analyzed as multiantenna techniques emerged @xcite , especially in cellular networks @xcite because of their potential to increase the dof of cellular networks . roughly speaking , equipping multiple antennas at the bs and/or users can drastically increase the sum dof of single - cell cellular networks proportionally with the number of equipped antennas .",
    "under multicell environment , cadambe and jafar recently made a remarkable progress showing that the optimal sum dof for the @xmath10-user ic is given by @xmath11 @xcite , which corresponds to the @xmath10-cell cellular network having one serving user in each cell .",
    "a new interference mitigation paradigm called interference alignment ( ia ) has been proposed to achieve the sum dof @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "multicell cellular networks having multiple serving users in each cell has been studied in @xcite under both uplink and downlink operation , each of which is called interfering multiple access channel ( imac ) @xcite and interfering broadcast channel ( ibc ) @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that multiple users in each cell is beneficial for increasing the sum dof of imac and ibc by utilizing multiple users in each cell for ia .    as a natural extension , integrating multiantenna techniques and ia techniques has been recently studied to boost the dof of multicell multiantenna cellular networks .",
    "the dof of the @xmath10-user ic having @xmath12 antennas at each transmitter and @xmath13 antennas at each receiver has been analyzed in @xcite .",
    "more recently , the imac and ibc models have been extended to multiantenna bs and/or multiantenna users , see @xcite and the references therein .          in this paper",
    ", we study a multiantenna two - cell cellular network in which the first and second cells operate as uplink and downlink respectively . for better understanding on the motivation of the paper ,",
    "we introduce a simple two - cell cellular network in fig .",
    "[ figs : motivating_ex ] .",
    "the first cell consists of a bs having two antennas and three users but the second cell consists of a bs having three antennas and two users .",
    "let us consider how to operate or coordinate this example network in order to maximize its sum dof .",
    "as we will explain later , if both cells operate as the conventional uplink or downlink , then the sum dof is limited by two from the dof result of the two - user multiple input multiple output ( mimo ) ic in @xcite .",
    "hence , activating one of the two cells can trivially achieve the optimal sum dof for these cases .",
    "notice that the another option is to operate the first cell as uplink and the second cell as downlink or vice versa .",
    "for this case , the two - user mimo ic upper bound in @xcite is given by three , suggesting that it might be possible to achieve more than two sum dof .",
    "but it is at least impossible to achieve more than two dof by simply activating one of two cells .",
    "we will show that for this case the optimal sum dof is given by @xmath14 , strictly greater than that achievable by the conventional uplink or downlink operation .",
    "the previous work on the dof of multiantenna cellular networks , however , inherently assumes either uplink or downlink so that it can not capture the possibility of such dof improvement from the uplink  downlink operation .",
    "therefore , the primary aim of this paper is to figure out whether operating as either the conventional uplink or downlink is optimal or not in terms of the dof for multicell multiantenna cellular networks .",
    "we focus on two - cell networks in which the first cell , consisting of a bs with @xmath0 antennas and @xmath1 users , operates as uplink and the second cell , constisting of a bs with @xmath2 antennas and @xmath3 users , operates as downlink .",
    "we completely characterize the sum dof and the result demonstrates that , depending on the network configuration , uplink  downlink operation is beneficial for increasing the sum dof compared to the conventional uplink or downlink operation .      in seminal work @xcite , cadambe and",
    "jafar showed that the optimal sum dof of the @xmath10-user ic with time - varying channel coefficients is given by @xmath15 , achievable by signal space ia .",
    "the concept of this signal space alignment has been successfully adapted to various network environments , e.g. , see @xcite and the references therein .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that ia can also be attained on fixed ( not time - varying ) channel coefficients .",
    "a different strategy of ia was developed in @xcite called ergodic ia , which makes interference aligned in the finite snr regime and , as a result , provides significant rate improvement compared with the conventional time - sharing strategy in the finite snr regime @xcite .",
    "the dof of @xmath10-user mimo ic has been considered in @xcite .    for multisource multihop networks ,",
    "interference can not only be aligned , but it can be cancelled through multiple paths , which is referred to as interference neutralization @xcite .",
    "the work @xcite has exploited ia to neutralize interference at final destinations , which is referred to as aligned interference neutralization , and showed that the optimal sum dof two is achievable for @xmath16-user @xmath16-hop networks with @xmath16 relays . similar concept of ergodic ia has been proposed for interference neutralization in @xcite showing that ergodic interference neutralization achieves the optimal sum dof of @xmath10-user @xmath10-hop isotropic fading networks with @xmath10 relays in each layer .",
    "recently , it has been shown in @xcite that the optimal sum dof of the @xmath10-user @xmath16-hop network with @xmath10 relays is given by @xmath10 .",
    "the dof of cellular networks has been first studied by suh and tse for both uplink and downlink environments , called imac and ibc respectively @xcite .",
    "it was shown that , for two - cell networks having @xmath10 users in each cell , the sum dof @xmath17 is achievable for both uplink and downlink .",
    "hence , multiple users at each cell are beneficial for improving the dof of cellular networks . the imac and ibc models have been extended to have multiple antennas at each bs and/or user @xcite .",
    "for multiantenna imac and ibc , it was shown that there exists in general a trade - off between two approaches : zero - forcing by using multiple antennas and asymptotic ia by treating each antenna as a separate user @xcite .",
    "recently , reverse time division duplex ( tdd ) , i.e. , operating a subset of cells as uplink and the rest of the cells as downlink , has been actively studied in heterogeneous cellular networks , consisting of macro bss with larger number of antennas and micro bss with smaller number of antennas @xcite . under various practical scenarios ,",
    "potential benefits of reverse tdd have been analyzed in the context of coverage @xcite , area spectral efficiency @xcite , throughput @xcite , and so on .",
