    "the chiral and deconfinement phase transitions of nonperaturbative systems are important issues of continuous interests both theoretically and experimentally .",
    "although the mechanism is unknown , the originally chiral symmetric system may undergo chiral phase transition ( cpt ) into a phase with dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( dcsb ) which explains the origin of constituent - quark masses in qcd and underlies the success of chiral effective field theory @xcite . in the chiral limit , the order parameter of cpt is defined via the fermion propagator @xmath1=\\int\\frac{\\mathrm{d}^dp}{(2\\pi)^d}\\frac{4b(p^2)}{a^2(p^2)p^2+b^2(p^2)}.\\ ] ] the two functions @xmath2 and @xmath3 in the above equation are related to the inverse fermion propagator @xmath4 the deconfinement phase transition is then related to the observation of the free particle and also the corresponding propagator . if the full fermion propagator has no mass singularity in the timelike region , it can never be on mass shell and the free particle can never be observed where the confinement happens @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the appearance of the mass singularity in the system directly implies deconfinement .",
    "so in this way we can learn the deconfinement phase transition from the analytic structure of the fermion propagator .",
    "to indicate dcsb and confinement , it is very suggestive to study some model that reveals the general nonperaturbative features while being simpler .",
    "three - dimensional quantum electrodynamics ( qed@xmath0 ) is just such a model which has many features similar to quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , such as dcsb and confinement @xcite .",
    "moreover , its superrenormalization obviate the ultraviolet divergence which is present in qed@xmath5 . due to these reasons",
    ", it can serve as a toy model of qcd . in parallel with its relevance as a tool through which to develop insight into aspects of qcd",
    ", qed@xmath0 is also found to be equivalent to the low - energy effective theories of strongly correlated electronic systems .",
    "recently , qed@xmath0 has been widely studied in graphene @xcite and high - t@xmath6 cuprate superconductors @xcite .",
    "the study of dcsb in qed@xmath0 has been an active subject near 30 years since appelquist _",
    "et al_. found that dcsb vanishes when the flavor of massless fermions reaches a critical number @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "they gain this conclusion by solving the truncated dyson - schwinger equation ( dse ) for the fermion propagator in the chiral limit . later",
    ", extensive analytical and numerical investigations showed that the existence of dcsb in qed@xmath0 remains the same after including higher order corrections to the dse @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the achievement in research of the mass singularity and confinement in qed@xmath0 is caused by a paper of p. maris who found that the fermion is confined by the truncated dse for the full fermion and boson propagators at @xmath8 @xcite where chiral symmetry is broken .",
    "this result might imply that the existence of confinement and dcsb depend on the same boundary conditions .",
    "moreover , the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that restoration of chiral symmetry and deconfinement are coincident owing to an abrupt change in the analytic properties of the fermion propagator when a nonzero scalar self - energy becomes insupportable .",
    "nevertheless , the above result will be altered when the gauge boson acquires a finite mass @xmath9 through the higgs mechanism @xcite . for a fixed @xmath10 and with the increasing boson mass ,",
    "the fermion chiral condensate falls and diminishes at a critical value @xmath11 ( which , of course , depends on @xmath12 ) and then chiral symmetry restores",
    ". since dcsb and confinement are nonperaturbative phenomena , both of them occur in the low energy region and might disappear with the rise of boson mass .",
    "therefore , it is very interesting to investigate whether or not both phase transitions occur at the same critical point in this case . in this paper , we will adopt the truncated dses for the full propagators to study the behaviors of the mass singularity and the fermion chiral condensate with a range of gauge boson mass and try to answer this question .",
    "the lagrangian for massless qed@xmath0 in a general covariant gauge in euclidean space can be written as @xmath13 where the 4-component spinor @xmath14 is the massless fermion field , @xmath15 is the gauge parameter .",
    "this system has chiral symmetry and the symmetry group is @xmath16 .",
    "the original @xmath16 symmetry reduces to @xmath17 when the massless fermion acquires a nonzero mass due to nonperaturbative effects . just as mentioned in sec .",
    "i , the chiral symmetry is broken by the dynamical generation of the fermion mass ( here @xmath18 ) .",
    "if one adopts the full boson propagator , the results of euclidean - time schwinger function reveal that the fermion propagator has a complex mass singularity and thus corresponds to a nonphysical observable state @xcite which means the appearance of confinement . on the contrary , if the schwinger function exhibits a real mass singularity of the propagator , the fermion is observable and the fermion is not confined @xcite . therefore , we also adopt this method to analyze those nonperaturbative phenomena .",
    "the schwinger function can be written as @xmath19 with @xmath20 .",
    "if there are two complex conjugate mass singularities @xmath21 associated with the fermion propagator , the function will show an oscillating behavior @xmath22 for large ( euclidean ) @xmath23 .",
    "however , the system reveals a stable observable asymptotic state with a mass @xmath24 for the fermion propagator , then @xmath25 by this way , the analysis of mass singularity can be used to determine whether or not the fermion is confined .",
    "since the schwinger function is determined by the fermion propagator and the dses provide us an powerful tool to study it , we shall use the coupled gap equations to calculate this function .",
    "now let us turn to the calculation of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "these functions can be obtained by solving dses for the fermion propagator , @xmath26 , \\label{eq2}\\ ] ] where @xmath27 is the full fermion - photon vertex and @xmath28 .",

    "@xcite ) .    using the relation between the vacuum polarization @xmath35 and @xmath37 , @xmath38",
    "we can obtain an equation for @xmath39 which has an ultraviolet divergence .",
    "fortunately , it is present only in the longitudinal part and is proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "this divergence can be removed by the projection operator @xmath41 and then we obtain a finite vacuum polarization@xcite .    finally , we choose to work in the landau gauge , since the landau gauge is the most convenient and commonly used one .",
    "once the fermion - boson vertex is known , we immediately obtain the truncated dses for the fermion propagator and then analyze the deconfinement and chiral phase transitions in this higgs model .",
    "the simplest and most commonly used truncated scheme for the dses is the rainbow approximation , @xmath42 since it gives us rainbow diagrams in the fermion dse and ladder diagrams in the bethe - salpeter equation for the fermion - antifermion bound state amplitude . in the framework of this approximation",
