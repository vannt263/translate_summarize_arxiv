    "the ensemble of cosmological data prefers best - bet universes which seem to congregate in several distinct regions of parameter space ( ostriker & steinhardt 1995 , viana 1996 ) . among the best - bet universes ,",
    "open models figure prominently and are possibly the favorite candidate ( liddle 1996a ) .",
    "this preference is mainly due to observational evidence ( e.g. , willick 1997 , carlberg 1996 , dekel 1997 ) .",
    "further motivation for examining @xmath32 models is that galaxy cluster baryonic fraction limits seem to be inconsistent with big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) if @xmath5 and @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) .",
    "this `` baryon catastrophe '' has led some to believe that @xmath32 .",
    "recently , theoretical open universe models have been developed .",
    "open - bubble inflation models have been developed by ratra & peebles ( 1994 ) , bucher , goldhaber & turok ( 1995 ) , yamamoto , sasaki & tanaka ( 1995 ) .",
    "open hybrid inflation has also been considered ( garca - bellido & linde 1997 ) .",
    "cmb measurements have become sensitive enough to constrain cosmological parameters in restricted classes of models . in lineweaver ( 1997 ) , ( henceforth `` paper 1 '' ) , we described our @xmath2 method and compared cmb data to predictions of cobe - normalized critical - density universes with harrison - zeldovich ( @xmath21 ) power spectra .",
    "we briefly looked at cdm and flat @xmath35 cdm models by exploring the @xmath36 plane and the @xmath37 plane .",
    "we used predominantly goodness - of - fit statistics to locate the regions of parameter space preferred by the cmb data .    in lineweaver & barbosa ( 1998 ) , ( henceforth `` paper 2 '' ) , we used a similar technique , again in critical - density universes , to explore the 4-dimensional parameter space @xmath0 , @xmath38 , @xmath3 and @xmath39 .",
    "we obtained the result that if @xmath5 ( and our other assumptions are correct ) then the cmb data prefer surprisingly low values of the hubble constant : @xmath40 .",
    "we found that four independent cosmological constraints also favored these low values in the @xmath5 models considered .",
    "this is in contrast to local measurements of @xmath0 which seem to prefer @xmath41 ( freedman 1998 , tammann & federspiel 1997 ) .",
    "the @xmath5 assumption we have made in our previous analyses can be considered very restrictive since plausible values for @xmath1 in the range @xmath42 can change the power spectrum significantly . in this work we consider open models motivated by the question : does our @xmath40 result depend on the fact that we limited ourselves to @xmath5 ?",
    "would a favored open model ( @xmath43 and @xmath14 ) be acceptable to the combined cmb data ?",
    "what pairs of @xmath44 values are compatible with the cmb data ?",
    "there are reasons to believe that @xmath32 models will allow higher @xmath0 values . in paper 2",
    "we found that the position of the primary acoustic peak in the angular power spectrum is a dominant feature determining the low value of @xmath0 .",
    "the position of the peak is shifted towards higher @xmath45 values in @xmath32 models and this should have the effect of increasing the @xmath0 values of the best - fit models . motivated by this idea and the more general idea of increasing the size of the parameter space into interesting regions , in this paper we put constraints on the cosmological parameters @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , and the normalization at @xmath4 in the context of @xmath46 cdm models .",
    "we assume adiabatic initial conditions with no cosmological constant .",
    "as in paper 1 and 2 , we take advantage of the recently available fast boltzmann code to make the parameter - dependent model power spectra ( seljak and zaldarriaga 1996 ) .",
    "we do not consider @xmath47 models because the code is not yet available .",
    "the recent dynamic interplay between theory ( providing a fast code to make model specific predictions ) and observations ( new measurements are coming in about once a month ) is increasing our ability to distinguish models .",
    "major efforts have been and are being put into obtaining flat - band power estimates .",
    "the synthesis of these efforts is an important step towards a more complete picture of the universe .",
    "since the main goal of two new cmb satellites ( map and planck surveyor ) is to constrain cosmological parameters , it is important and timely to keep track of the data s increasing ability to reject larger regions of parameter space and put tighter constraints on preferred models .",
    "that is the purpose of this paper .",
    "previous analyses most closely related to this work include ganga ( 1996 ) , white & silk ( 1996 ) , white ( 1996 ) , hancock ( 1998 ) , bond & jaffe ( 1997 ) , debernardis ( 1997 ) .",
    "although methods , models and data sets differ , in the limited cases where comparison is possible we have found no large discrepancies .    in section 2",
    "we summarize the method used to obtain the results and examine some of the special features of open models . in section 3",
    "we present our @xmath48 results and in section 4 we compare them to non - cmb results . in section 5",
    "we present our results for @xmath3 , the normalization , @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "in section 6 we discuss and summarize .",
    "we use a combination of the most recent cmb flat - band power measurements to place constraints on @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and the normalization at @xmath4 , @xmath51 ( see section 2.2 for @xmath51 definition ) .",
    "we examine how the constraints on any one of these parameters changes as we condition on as well as minimize with respect to the other parameters .",
    "we obtain best - fit values and approximate likelihood intervals for these parameters .",
    "we update the data of paper 2 to include several more points : + @xmath52 updated tenerife point ( gutirrez 1997 ) : @xmath53k at @xmath54 + @xmath52 new msam results ( cheng 1997 ) : @xmath55k at @xmath56 and @xmath57k at @xmath58 + @xmath52 new preliminary cat results ( baker 1997 ) : @xmath59k at @xmath60 and @xmath61k at @xmath62 + @xmath52 new preliminary ovro result ( leitch 1998 ) : @xmath63k at @xmath64 .",
    "+ the current cmb flat - band power estimates used in this analysis are listed in table 1 and plotted in figure 1 .",
    "since there is much scatter in the data , there is much scepticism about the ability of the points to prefer any particular region of parameter space .",
    "we showed in papers 1 and 2 however that a simple @xmath2 analysis of interesting restricted families of models is capable of showing substantial preferences for relatively small regions of parameter space .",
    "the scatter in the data is partially deceiving in the sense that averaging the data over broader bands in @xmath45 reduces the scatter and presents a surprisingly coherent power spectrum which roughly follows the polynomial fit in figure 1 .",
    "essentially , we are trying to find the parameters of the model that looks most like the dotted line in figure 1 .",
    "figure 2 is an example of some of the model power spectra tested . for each point in the 4-d parameter space",
    "we obtain a value for @xmath65 .",
    "the parameter values at the minimum value ( @xmath66 ) are the best - fit parameters .",
    "the error bars we quote for each parameter are from the maximum and minimum parameter values within the 4-d surface which satisfies @xmath67 . to display the result we project this surface onto the two dimensions of our choice .",
    "the @xmath2 calculation is described in more detail in papers 1 and 2 .",
    "figure 3 is the first in a series of contour plots which illustrates our results .",
    "the four contours correspond to @xmath68 surfaces where @xmath69 $ ] .",
    "the interpretation of these contours is not straightforward .",
    "the conditions under which these contours can be projected onto an axis yielding @xmath70 and @xmath71 confidence intervals is described in press ( 1992 p 690 ) ( see also avni 1976 ) .",
    "these conditions are : i ) the errors are normally distributed and ii ) the model is linear in the parameters _ or _ that a linear approximation reasonably represents the models within the range of parameters of interest .",
    "debernardis ( 1997 ) find that the error bars are approximately normal .",
    "although the model power spectra are nonlinear in the parameters , an approximation linear in the parameters may be able to represent the power spectrum near the @xmath2 minima .",
    "for example , in figure 2 , several families of models are plotted .",
    "the data have a maximum @xmath72 value of @xmath73 .",
    "the ability of the @xmath2 to discriminate between models comes almost exclusively from the data in the range @xmath74 .",
    "the strongest nonlinearities in the models ( typified by regions where the models do not trace each other but overlap in complicated ways ) are in the @xmath45 range to which the data is not sensitive .",
    "it could be argued that the relevant parts of the models may be approximated by the first two terms of a taylor expansion of the power spectrum around the best - fit parameter values .",
    "the accuracy of this linear approximation is a measure of the accuracy of the correspondence we would like to establish between the @xmath75 contour and the @xmath76 confidence interval .",
    "the ellipticities of the contours in figures 3 , 4 and 7 are also a measure of the accuracy of the linear approximation ; exactly linear models would give concentric , exact ellipses with identical orientations and position angles and with semimajor axes in the ratios 1:2:3:4 . we conclude that the error bars that we derive from the @xmath75 contours may be useful approximations to @xmath13 confidence limits , but that the @xmath77 , 9 , and 16 contours are at best rough guides to the 2 , 3 , and 4 @xmath78 confidence intervals .",
    "work is in progress to quantify the accuracy of the linear approximation .",
    "bond , jaffe & knox ( 1998 ) have done a preliminary analysis comparing a @xmath2-minimization analysis of flat - band estimates to a more complete pixel - based treatment .",
    "their general conclusion is that our `` radical data compression method works ... sort of '' since the minima found by the two techniques agree fairly well .",
    "we normalize in the middle of the cobe dmr data ( @xmath79 ) rather than at the edge ( @xmath80 ) to reduce the otherwise strong correlation between the best - fit slope and normalization .",
    "we parametrize the normalization at @xmath4 using the symbol @xmath51 _ defined by _ and its power spectrum is @xmath81 .",
    "note that here @xmath82 is not an ensemble average . ]",
    "10(10 + 1)c_10 = .",
    "[ eq : c10 ] equation [ eq : c10 ] is simply a way to write @xmath83 with the added convenience that for an @xmath21 pure sachs - wolfe spectrum ( @xmath84 ) , @xmath51 is equivalent to the power spectrum normalizing quadrupole @xmath85 ( see smoot 1992 ) .",
    "we have used the new calibration ( leitch 1998 ) for the saskatoon results whereby the nominal saskatoon calibration ( netterfield 1995 , netterfield 1997 ) is increased by @xmath86 with a correlated calibration uncertainty around this new value of @xmath87 .",
    "we treat the calibration of the 5 saskatoon points as a nuisance parameter `` @xmath88 '' coming from a gaussian distribution with a dispersion of @xmath87 ( rather than the @xmath89 used in paper 2 ) . in this sense",
    "our error bars include an estimate of the saskatoon calibration uncertainty .",
    "in general the minimum @xmath2 fits prefer @xmath90 . this can be understood quite easily by examining figure 1 .",
    "the little boxes above and below the saskatoon points are @xmath91 of the central values .",
    "@xmath92 corresponds to @xmath93 .",
    "moving all 5 saskatoon points down by @xmath94 gives the best agreement with the dotted line , representing all the data .",
    "thus @xmath90 is the preferred value .",
    "there are 32 data points and in the most general case where all 5 parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 , @xmath51 , @xmath88 ) are free , there are 27 degrees of freedom (= 32 - 5 ) . when both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are low and thus nominally @xmath95 ; we set @xmath96 , thus creating purely baryonic models in the lower left corners of figures 3 and 4 .",
    "computer limits restrict the number of discrete @xmath97 values we can test .",
    "we have performed all calculations for each of 3 values of @xmath97 : @xmath98 .",
    "thus we have explored three 4-d slices of parameter space . for completeness",
    "we have also minimized with respect to @xmath97 in the same way we have for the other parameters , but the @xmath97 minimization is restricted to only three discrete values .",
    "the results from this highly discretized bbn range minimization are indicated by `` @xmath99 '' in the @xmath97 column of table 2 .",
    "acoustic oscillations of the baryon  photon fluid at recombination produce peaks in the cmb power spectrum around degree angular scales .",
    "it is convenient to discuss power spectra in terms of the amplitude and the position of the first such peak : @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "for example , the amplitude and position of the polynomial fit to the data ( dotted line in figure 1 ) are @xmath100k and @xmath101 .",
    "for the physics of the acoustic peaks , see the pioneering work by hu ( 1995 ) and hu & sugiyama ( 1995a , 1995b ) .    in figure 2",
    "we plot cmb power spectra to display the influence of @xmath1 and @xmath0 and @xmath97 .",
    "the dotted line is the same in each panel , is the same as in figure 1 and represents the data .",
    "these models are for @xmath21 , @xmath102k . in figure 2",
    "we can see that the peak amplitudes @xmath49 depend strongly on @xmath0 and @xmath97 .",
    "higher values of @xmath97 lead to larger doppler peaks due to the enhanced compression caused by a larger effective mass ( more baryons per photon ) of the oscillating fluid . for a given @xmath97 ,",
    "a small @xmath0 means high @xmath49 .",
    "@xmath51 variations would raise and lower the entire curve while variations in the slope @xmath3 would raise and lower @xmath49 .    in figure 2 ,",
    "when @xmath103 , @xmath104 .",
    "similarly , as @xmath105 , @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath1 dependence of @xmath50 is a purely geometric effect . the more open the universe , the smaller the angle subtended by the same physical size .",
    "the main point of figure 2 is that lowering @xmath0 and lowering @xmath1 both have the same effect of raising @xmath50 .",
    "in paper 1 and 2 we maintained that it was predominantly the position of the peak that favored low @xmath0 in @xmath106 models .",
    "here we see that lowering @xmath1 can raise @xmath50 to fit the data , hence @xmath0 does not have to be as low . the behaviour of @xmath107 and @xmath108 can be tabulated as , +   + which is to be read `` @xmath107 goes up when @xmath0 or @xmath1 go down or when @xmath97 or @xmath3 go up '' .",
    "see hu , sugiyama & silk ( 1997 ) for more details .",
    "the @xmath48 diagram is a convenient framework in which to explore and present a combination of cosmological parameters .",
    "the regions preferred by the cmb are shown in figures 3 and 4 .",
    "the results from these figures are given in the first two sections of table 2 which also contains the main results of this paper for @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 and @xmath51 .",
    "for each result , the conditions under which it was obtained are listed and these conditions are relaxed as we move from the top to the bottom .",
    "table 2 also lists @xmath2 values and the corresponding probabilities @xmath109 of obtaining @xmath2 values smaller than the values actually obtained , under the assumption that the errors on the data points are gaussian .",
    "@xmath2 values and probabilities are discussed in section [ sec : chi ] .      for @xmath5",
    "we get @xmath110 , which is the same low @xmath0 value we obtained in paper 2 .",
    "the new saskatoon calibration and the new data used here do not change our previous result .    in figure 3 we present the likelihood contours in the @xmath48 plane for @xmath21 .",
    "the minimum is at @xmath22 .",
    "the minimum @xmath2 value and the probability of obtaining a smaller value for that model are @xmath111 and @xmath112 respectively .",
    "thus the fit is `` good '' .",
    "figure 4 is the same as figure 3 except we no longer condition on @xmath21 .",
    "the best - fit @xmath0 value stays low but higher and lower @xmath0 values are now acceptable at @xmath113 .",
    "thus , uncertainty in @xmath3 plays an important role in the inability of cmb data to determine @xmath0 .",
    "the banana - shaped @xmath12 contour can be projected onto an axis to yield an approximation to a @xmath76 confidence interval around the best - fit value .",
    "thus , @xmath7 or @xmath114 .",
    "a favored open model with @xmath14 and @xmath15 is more than @xmath16 from the cmb data best - fit model and can be rejected based on goodness of fit at the 99% confidence level . in contrast to our previous @xmath5 results , allowing @xmath32 permits much larger @xmath0 values and there is no longer a disagreement with more direct local measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "our @xmath1 results are also given in table 2 . in figure 3 ( @xmath21 )",
    "we obtain @xmath115 and set a lower limit @xmath116 .",
    "we obtain no upper limit because we were unable to test @xmath47 models . in figure 4",
    "we obtain @xmath117 with a lower limit of @xmath118 at @xmath113 and @xmath119 at @xmath120 .",
    "thus the cmb can place important constraints on these models .",
    "if we assume that @xmath41 ( as indicated by local @xmath0 measurements ) then the cmb data prefer a density in the range @xmath121 and a power spectral slope @xmath122 .",
    "the variations in @xmath3 and @xmath97 permit the large range of @xmath0 seen in figure 4 .",
    "for example , for the highest values of @xmath0 , @xmath123 and @xmath124 while for the lowest @xmath0 values @xmath125 and @xmath126 .",
    "@xmath3 variations alone are not sufficient to permit very high @xmath0 values .",
    "for example if we let @xmath3 be free but we condition on @xmath126 then @xmath0 remains small : @xmath127 .",
    "if we condition on @xmath128 then @xmath129 .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath97 are keeping the peak amplitude fit correctly .",
    "high @xmath0 values suppress the peak height but this is compensated for by high @xmath3 and @xmath97 .",
    "the elongated banana - shaped @xmath12 contour in figure 4 means that @xmath0 and @xmath1 are anti - correlated . in figure 2 we see that @xmath104 when @xmath103 or @xmath105 .",
    "thus high @xmath1 go with low @xmath0 and low @xmath1 go with high @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath12 contour in figure 4 traces out this strong anti - correlation . to get a constraint on two parameters simultaneously",
    "we need to look at the @xmath130 contour .",
    "this can be described by @xmath131 .",
    "this should be compared to the constraint on the same quantity from cluster baryonic fractions ( see figure 5 and section [ sec : clusters ] ) .",
    "to view our results within a larger picture , we compare them to other cosmological measurements and identify what the cmb constraints can add to this picture .",
    "the independent non - cmb cosmological measurements are summarized below .",
    "they are the same constraints used in paper 2 ( with modifications described below ) and we now include local measurements of @xmath0 .",
    "peacock & dodds ( 1994 ) made an empirical fit to the matter power spectrum using a shape parameter @xmath132 .",
    "for @xmath46 models , @xmath132 can be written as ( sugiyama 1995 ) = h exp .",
