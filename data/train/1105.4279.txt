    ", we only consider finite - dimensional frames .",
    "those not familiar with frame theory can simply view a finite - dimensional frame as an @xmath12 matrix of rank @xmath13 whose columns are the frame elements .",
    "with this view , the tightness condition is equivalent to having the spectral norm be as small as possible ; for an @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 , this equivalently means @xmath14 .    throughout the literature , applications require finite - dimensional frames that are nearly tight and have small worst - case coherence @xcite . among these , a foremost application is sparse signal processing , where frames of small spectral norm and/or small worst - case coherence are commonly used to analyze sparse signals @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced another notion of frame coherence called _ average coherence _ : @xmath15 note that , in addition to having zero worst - case coherence , orthonormal bases also have zero average coherence .",
    "it was established in @xcite that when @xmath16 is sufficiently smaller than @xmath17 , a number of guarantees can be provided for sparse signal processing .",
    "it is therefore evident from @xcite that there is a pressing need for nearly tight frames with small worst - case and average coherence , especially in the area of sparse signal processing .",
    "this paper offers four main contributions in this regard .",
    "first , we discuss three types of frames that exhibit small spectral norm , worst - case coherence , and average coherence : normalized gaussian , random harmonic , and code - based frames . with all three frame parameters provably small ,",
    "these frames are guaranteed to perform well in relevant applications .",
    "second , performance in many applications is dictated by worst - case coherence @xcite .",
    "it is therefore particularly important to understand which worst - case coherence values are achievable . to this end",
    ", the welch bound @xcite is commonly used in the literature . however , the welch bound is only tight when the number of frame elements @xmath18 is less than the square of the spatial dimension @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "another lower bound , given in @xcite and @xcite , beats the welch bound when there are more frame elements , but it is known to be loose for real frames @xcite .",
    "given this context , our next contribution is a new lower bound on the worst - case coherence of real frames .",
    "our bound beats both the welch bound and the bound in @xcite and @xcite when the number of frame elements far exceeds the spatial dimension .",
    "third , since average coherence is new to the frame theory literature , we investigate how it relates to worst - case coherence and spectral norm .",
    "in particular , we want average coherence to satisfy the following property , which is used in @xcite to provide various guarantees for sparse signal processing :    we say an @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 satisfies the _ strong coherence property _ if @xmath19 where @xmath17 and @xmath16 are given by and , respectively .",
    "since average coherence is so new , there is currently no intuition as to when ( scp-2 ) is satisfied . as a third contribution",
    ", this paper shows how to transform a frame that satisfies ( scp-1 ) into another frame with the same spectral norm and worst - case coherence that additionally satisfies ( scp-2 ) .",
    "finally , this paper uses the strong coherence property to provide new guarantees on both sparse signal detection and reconstruction in the presence of noise .",
    "these guarantees are related to those in @xcite , and we elaborate on this relationship in section v. in the interest of space , the proofs have been omitted throughout , but they can be found in @xcite .",
    "many applications require nearly tight frames with small worst - case and average coherence . in this section ,",
    "we give three types of frames that satisfy these conditions .",
    "construct a matrix with independent , gaussian distributed entries that have zero mean and unit variance . by normalizing the columns ,",
    "we get a matrix called a _",
    "normalized gaussian frame_. this is perhaps the most widely studied type of frame in the signal processing and statistics literature .    to be clear",
    ", the term `` normalized '' is intended to distinguish the results presented here from results reported in earlier works , such as @xcite , which only ensure that the frame elements of gaussian frames have unit norm in expectation . in other words ,",
    "normalized gaussian frames are frames with individual frame elements independently and uniformly distributed on the unit hypersphere in @xmath20 .",
    "that said , the following theorem characterizes the spectral norm and the worst - case and average coherence of normalized gaussian frames .",

    "it is therefore particularly important to understand which worst - case coherence values are achievable . to this end , the following bound is commonly used in the literature :    [ thm.welch bound ] every @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 has worst - case coherence @xmath55 .",

    "in @xcite , average coherence is used to garner a number of guarantees on sparse signal processing . since",
    "average coherence is so new to the frame theory literature , this section will investigate how average coherence relates to worst - case coherence and the spectral norm .",
    "we start with a definition :    [ def.flipping and wiggling ] we say the frames @xmath2 and @xmath21 are _ wiggling equivalent _ if there exists a diagonal matrix @xmath72 of unimodular entries such that @xmath73 .",
    "furthermore , they are _ flipping equivalent _ if @xmath72 is real , having only @xmath74 s on the diagonal .",
    "the terms `` wiggling '' and `` flipping '' are inspired by the fact that individual frame elements of such equivalent frames are related by simple unitary operations .",
    "note that every frame with @xmath18 nonzero frame elements belongs to a flipping equivalence class of size @xmath75 , while being wiggling equivalent to uncountably many frames .",
    "the importance of this type of frame equivalence is , in part , due to the following lemma , which characterizes the shared geometry of wiggling equivalent frames :    [ lem : geom_eqframes ] wiggling equivalence preserves the norms of frame elements , the worst - case coherence , and the spectral norm .    now that we understand wiggling and flipping equivalence , we are ready for the main idea behind this section .",
    "suppose we are given a unit norm frame with acceptable spectral norm and worst - case coherence , but we also want the average coherence to satisfy ( scp-2 ) . then by lemma  [ lem : geom_eqframes ] , all of the wiggling equivalent frames will also have acceptable spectral norm and worst - case coherence , and so it is reasonable to check these frames for good average coherence .",
    "in fact , the following theorem guarantees that at least one of the flipping equivalent frames will have good average coherence , with only modest requirements on the original frame s redundancy .",
    "[ thm : avc_rand ] let @xmath2 be an @xmath12 unit norm frame with @xmath76 .",
    "then there exists a frame @xmath21 that is flipping equivalent to @xmath2 and satisfies @xmath77 .",
    "while theorem  [ thm : avc_rand ] guarantees the existence of a flipping equivalent frame with good average coherence , the result does not describe how to find it .",
    "certainly , one could check all @xmath75 frames in the flipping equivalence class , but such a procedure is computationally slow . as an alternative , we propose a linear - time flipping algorithm ( algorithm  [ alg : flipping ] ) .",
    "the following theorem guarantees that linear - time flipping will produce a frame with good average coherence , but it requires the original frame s redundancy to be higher than what suffices in theorem  [ thm : avc_rand ] .",
    "* input : * an @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 + * output : * an @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath21 that is flipping equivalent to @xmath2    @xmath78 @xmath79",

    ". then algorithm  [ alg : flipping ] outputs an @xmath12 frame @xmath21 that is flipping equivalent to @xmath2 and satisfies @xmath82 .",

    "even though @xmath85 , we can run linear - time flipping to get the flipping pattern @xmath86 .",

    "frames with small spectral norm , worst - case coherence , and/or average coherence have found use in recent years with applications involving sparse signals .",
    "donoho et al .",
    "used the worst - case coherence in @xcite to provide uniform bounds on the signal and support recovery performance of combinatorial and convex optimization methods and greedy algorithms .",
    "later , tropp @xcite and cands and plan @xcite used both the spectral norm and worst - case coherence to provide tighter bounds on the signal and support recovery performance of convex optimization methods for most support sets under the additional assumption that the sparse signals have independent nonzero entries with zero median .",
    "recently , bajwa et al .",
    "@xcite made use of the spectral norm and both coherence parameters to report tighter bounds on the noisy model selection and noiseless signal recovery performance of an incredibly fast greedy algorithm called _ one - step thresholding ( ost ) _ for most support sets and _ arbitrary _ nonzero entries . in this section ,",
    "we discuss further implications of the spectral norm and worst - case and average coherence of frames in applications involving sparse signals .",
    "a common task in signal processing applications is to test whether a collection of measurements corresponds to mere noise @xcite . for applications involving sparse signals",
    ", one can test measurements @xmath89 against the null hypothsis @xmath90 and alternative hypothesis @xmath91 , where the entries of the noise vector @xmath92 are independent , identical zero - mean complex - gaussian random variables and the signal @xmath93 is @xmath94-sparse .",
    "the performance of such signal detection problems is directly proportional to the energy in @xmath95 @xcite . in particular , existing literature on the detection of sparse signals @xcite leverages the fact that @xmath96 when @xmath2 satisfies the restricted isometry property ( rip ) of order @xmath94 .",
    "in contrast , we now show that the strong coherence property also guarantees @xmath96 for most @xmath94-sparse vectors .",
    "we start with a definition :    we say an @xmath12 frame @xmath2 satisfies the _ @xmath97-weak restricted isometry property ( weak rip ) _ if for every @xmath94-sparse vector @xmath98 , a random permutation @xmath99 of @xmath100 s entries satisfies @xmath101 with probability exceeding @xmath102 .",
    "we note the distinction between rip and weak rip  weak rip requires that @xmath2 preserves the energy of _ most _ sparse vectors .",
    "moreover , the manner in which we quantify `` most '' is important . for each sparse vector ,",
    "@xmath2 preserves the energy of most permutations of that vector , but for different sparse vectors , @xmath2 might not preserve the energy of permutations with the same support .",
    "that is , unlike rip , weak rip is _ not _ a statement about the singular values of submatrices of @xmath2 .",
    "certainly , matrices for which most submatrices are well - conditioned , such as those discussed in @xcite , will satisfy weak rip , but weak rip does not require this .",
    "that said , the following theorem shows , in part , the significance of the strong coherence property .",
    "another common task in signal processing applications is to reconstruct a @xmath94-sparse signal @xmath93 from a small collection of linear measurements @xmath106 .",
    "recently , tropp @xcite used both the worst - case coherence and spectral norm of frames to find bounds on the reconstruction performance of _ basis pursuit ( bp ) _",
    "@xcite for most support sets under the assumption that the nonzero entries of @xmath100 are independent with zero median .",

    "our goal in this section is to provide guarantees for the reconstruction of sparse signals from noisy measurements @xmath108 , where the entries of the noise vector @xmath92 are independent , identical complex - gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath109 . in particular , and in contrast with @xcite",
    ", our guarantees will hold for arbitrary frames @xmath2 without requiring the signal s sparsity level to satisfy @xmath110 .",
    "the reconstruction algorithm that we analyze here is the ost algorithm of @xcite , which is described in algorithm  [ alg : ost_recon ] .",
    "the following theorem extends the analysis of @xcite and shows that the ost algorithm leads to near - optimal reconstruction error for large classes of sparse signals .    before proceeding further ,",
    "we first define some notation .",
    "we use @xmath111 $ ] to denote the _ signal - to - noise ratio _ associated with the signal reconstruction problem .",
    "also , we use @xmath112 for any @xmath113 to denote the locations of all the entries of @xmath100 that , roughly speaking , lie above the _ noise floor _ @xmath114",
    ". finally , we use @xmath115 to denote the locations of entries of @xmath100 that , roughly speaking , lie above the _ self - interference floor _ @xmath116 .",
    "[ thm : rsp ] take an @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 which satisfies the strong coherence property , pick @xmath125 , and choose @xmath126 .",
    "further , suppose @xmath98 has support @xmath127 drawn uniformly at random from all possible @xmath94-subsets of @xmath128 .",

    "a few remarks are in order now for theorem  [ thm : rsp ] .",
    "first , if @xmath2 satisfies the strong coherence property _ and _ @xmath2 is nearly tight , then ost handles sparsity that is almost linear in @xmath13 : @xmath140 from .",
    "second , the @xmath141 error associated with the ost algorithm is the near - optimal ( modulo the @xmath142 factor ) error of @xmath143 _ plus _ the best @xmath144-term approximation error caused by the inability of the ost algorithm to recover signal entries that are smaller than @xmath145 .",
    "nevertheless , it is easy to convince oneself that such error is still near - optimal for large classes of sparse signals .",
    "consider , for example , the case where @xmath146 , the magnitudes of @xmath147 nonzero entries of @xmath100 are some @xmath148 , while the magnitudes of the other @xmath147 nonzero entries are not necessarily same but scale as @xmath149 .",
    "then we have from theorem  [ thm : rsp ] that @xmath150 , which leads to near - optimal @xmath141 error of @xmath151 .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this is the first result in the sparse signal processing literature that does not require rip and still provides near - optimal reconstruction guarantees for such signals in the presence of noise , while using either random or deterministic frames , even when @xmath140 ."
