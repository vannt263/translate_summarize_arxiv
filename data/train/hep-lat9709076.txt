    "in 2-dimensional quantum gravity one of the most fundamental physical ( universal ) quantities is the string susceptibility exponent ( @xmath6 ) which characterizes the partition function of surfaces with a fixed topology through @xmath7 for the large-@xmath8 limit , where @xmath8 is the 2-dimensional volume ( area ) , and @xmath9 is the cosmological constant . the string susceptibility exponent is known to be given by the formula @xmath10 + 2     \\label{eq : gamma}\\ ] ] in the continuum framework @xcite as well as the matrix model @xcite , where @xmath11 is the number of handles of the 2-dimensional surface , and @xmath12 represents the central charge of matter fields coupled to the surface . eq.([eq : gamma ] ) is expected to hold for a discretized 2-dimensional surface with arbitral @xmath11 and @xmath13 , when the dynamical triangulation recipe @xcite is adopted to generate random surfaces .    in order to measure the string susceptibility exponent with any topology",
    ", we introduced the grand - canonical monte carlo method . among quantities of interest",
    "the string susceptibility exponent of a spherical surface has been extensively calculated numerically by various methods for examining the theoretical prediction , and a numerical method as well . the minbu ( minimum neck baby universe ) algorithm @xcite and the grand - canonical monte carlo methods @xcite have been successful as long as the central charge is less than one with sphere topology . however , in the minbu algorithm measuring @xmath6 for a surface with higher genus is more complicated than for a sphere , because the minimum neck baby universe must not be topologically non - trivial , and the baby universe distribution describing two topologically different @xmath6 must be separated independently @xcite .",
    "also , this algorithm is subject to rather large finite - size effects , because the baby universes are dominated by small sizes , even if the mother universe is large . it can not give reliable values for @xmath14 unless we know the finite - size correction accurately @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , in the grand - canonical ensemble methods the finite - size effect enters through the total area , and becomes controllable in reasonably large size simulations . in this study",
    "we generated a sufficiently large size surface with a wider region of area compared with the previous studies , which is essential to determine @xmath9 accurately .",
    "eq.([eq : gamma ] ) shows that @xmath6 becomes complex for @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) , which is clearly unphysical and suggests that the nature of the surface will change significantly as @xmath12 moves beyond unity .",
    "it is generally believed that this `` transition '' reflects the tachyonic instability of a bosonic string for @xmath17 . in a numerical simulation by dynamical",
    "triangulation the partition function is kept real for any value of @xmath12 , and the instability is considered to appear along with the collapse of the surface to branched polymers .",
    "the string susceptibility exponent of the branched polymer ( @xmath18 ) depends on the model .",
    "in fact , in ref .",
    "@xmath18 for a sphere is evaluated as @xmath19 , while in ref .",
    "they calculated @xmath18 with any topology : @xmath20 in the case of a torus ( @xmath21 ) the effect of the tachyon can not be seen in the string susceptibility exponent , because both eq.([eq : gamma ] ) and eq.([eq : branch ] ) give the same value of @xmath22 for any @xmath12 .    in order to check the theoretical expectations ( eqs.([eq : gamma ] ) and ( [ eq : branch ] ) ) , we need to calculate the string susceptibility exponent for a surface with any topology .",
    "we describe details of our method in section [ sec : method ] , and our numerical results in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "section [ sec : discussion ] is devoted to a summary and discussions .",
    "the grand - canonical partition function with a fixed topology is defined by @xmath23 where @xmath24 in eqs.([eq : z_lambda ] ) and ( [ eq : z_sigma ] ) @xmath25 refers to a specific triangulation , @xmath26 is the symmetry factor , @xmath27 is the number of @xmath28-simplices ( _ i.e. _ @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the number of vertices , links and triangles ) , @xmath32 is a parameter , and @xmath33 is a coupling strength of ising spins",
    ". there are @xmath0 kinds of ising spins ( @xmath34 ) , and each ising spin lives on a vertex of triangulated surface ( not on the dual lattice ) .",
    "one kind of ising spins carries @xmath35 central charge at the critical point @xmath36 , and thus the @xmath0 kinds of ising spins correspond to @xmath37 .",
    "the partition function is written for the large-@xmath31 limit as @xmath38 then , the probability of fixing a surface with @xmath31 triangles ( @xmath39 ) for large @xmath31 is approximately given by @xmath40 from @xmath41 if we tune the parameter @xmath32 close to @xmath9 within the precision @xmath42 we can evaluate the string susceptibility exponent by plotting @xmath43 as a function of @xmath44 .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 is determined in the following manner .",
    "if @xmath32 is chosen to be less ( or greater ) than @xmath9 , the system will expand ( or shrink ) exponentially in the grand - canonical simulation . by requiring an exponential increase ( or decrease ) to disappear in the simulation we can find the parameter @xmath32 precisely .",
    "we then generate configurations dynamically near to the critical point @xmath9 , constraining @xmath31 within a upper- and a lower - bound ( @xmath45 ) .",
    "we generate dynamically triangulated surfaces using the grand - canonical monte carlo method . in order to keep @xmath31 within the appropriate range wide enough to extract @xmath6 from eq.([eq : log_distribution ] ) , but not too large for the sake of the computing time , we simply ignore all of the moves that make the number of triangles become less than @xmath46 or greater than @xmath47 . here , we restrict ourself to graphs excluding `` tadpole '' and `` self - energy '' in the dual lattice . we note that in the grand - canonical method we must pay careful attention to satisfying the detailed valance , because the number of states depends on the total number of triangles and the coordination number of each vertex .",
    "we first explain the method used to generate dynamically triangulated surfaces in the case of pure gravity ( @xmath48 ) .",
    "suppose that we wish to increase the number of real vertices from @xmath29 to @xmath49 ; to do this we choose two dual links belonging to the same dual loop , and insert a `` propagator '' dual link joining the two dual links , thus creating an additional dual loop .",
    "for the inverse move , @xmath50 , we choose a dual link at random , and remove it , resulting in two dual loops separated by the dual link merging into one dual loop .",
    "the total number of possible increase ( or decrease ) moves from configuration @xmath8 are @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the set of coordination numbers of configuration @xmath8 .    in these moves",
    "the ergodic property is automatically satisfied .",
    "however , we must treat the detailed valance carefully , since the total number of possible moves depends on @xmath29 and @xmath53 .",
    "we must multiply the prefactor to the boltzmann weight in order to satisfy the detailed valance equation for the moves between configurations @xmath8 and @xmath54 , given by @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the transition probability from configurations @xmath8 to @xmath54 , @xmath57 is the boltzmann factor , and @xmath58 is the number of possible moves from configuration @xmath8 . for detailed arguments for eq.([eq : detail_bal ] ) on random lattices , see ref.@xcite .    for the case @xmath59 , when a dual loop is separated by two dual loops , two spins should be attached to the two dual loops , which counts four spin states ; in the inverse case one of two neighboring spins should be taken out , which counts two spin states .",
    "the combined number of operations and the boltzmann factor are @xmath60 @xmath61 for the spin variables , monte carlo trials with wolff s cluster algorithm @xcite are performed after some geometrical moves .",
    ".@xmath62 [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tabel:2genus ]    we have measured the string susceptibility exponent for various combinations of @xmath63 and @xmath64 . the central charge and topology of the surface",
    "are kept fixed during each simulation . when ising spins are put on the surface",
    ", we search the critical coupling strength ( @xmath65 ) with the fixed number of triangles set at 3000 before making a grand - canonical simulation . we determine the critical coupling strength from the peak of magnetic susceptibility for each combination of @xmath12 and @xmath11 . in the case of a torus the experimental values ( @xmath65 ) were quite close to the theoretical value ( @xmath66 ) , and we used the exact value ; in the other cases , however , we used the experimental @xmath65 .",
    "we set the maximum number of triangles ( @xmath47 ) to @xmath67 and the minimum one ( @xmath46 ) to @xmath68 .",
    "one sweep is defined by @xmath69 trial moves and 5 cluster operations of ising spin .    in order to obtain @xmath39",
    ", we measure the number of triangles ( @xmath31 ) for @xmath70 times every 5 sweeps . plotting @xmath43 versus @xmath44 , such as fig.[fig:0genus0spin ]",
    ", we determine the string susceptibility exponent from its slope .",
    "our results are summarized in tables 1 , 2 and 3 for a sphere , torus and double - torus , respectively .",
    "especially , in the pure gravity case we know the theoretical value , @xmath71 and our experimental @xmath9 is very close to theoretical prediction .",
    "the errors indicated in parentheses for the last two digits are only statistical errors estimated from the least - squares fits .",
    "the systematic errors are due mainly to how close we can determine @xmath32 to @xmath9 . in our simulation",
    "this systematic error is estimated to be around @xmath72 .",
    "we calculated the string susceptibility exponents of 2-dimensional triangulated surfaces coupled to @xmath0-ising spins ( @xmath0=0,1,2,3,5 ) with various topologies ( @xmath11=0,1,2 ) using the grand - canonical monte carlo method .",
    "one of the advantages of our method is the ability to treat various topologies .",
    "fig.[fig : puregravity ] shows good agreements to the theory for not only a sphere , but also for a torus and a double - torus of the pure gravity .",
    "furthermore , in figs.[fig : sphere],[fig : torus ] and [ fig : double - torus ] the string susceptibility exponents for various topologies ( @xmath64 ) are reproduced very closely to the theoretical predictions as long as @xmath13 . especially for @xmath73 of the spherical surface",
    "we give the theoretically expected @xmath6 .",
    "the log correction in the partition function is one order smaller than the leading term in our simulation for @xmath31 , being on the order @xmath74 , which proves that our method is free from a finite - size correction , compared to the minbu algorithm .",
    "we are especially interested in the behavior of @xmath6 for @xmath17 . in the case of a torus ( @xmath21 ) we can not observe the effect of the central charge in fig.[fig : torus ] , as expected from the theoretical prediction in eq.([eq : gamma ] ) and eq.([eq : branch ] ) . in the spherical case ( @xmath75 )",
    "@xmath6 becomes positive and increases slowly , while in the double - torus ( @xmath76 ) it seems to decrease slowly .",
    "although 2-dimensional surfaces seem to make a transition to the branched polymer phase gradually as @xmath17 , based on these figures , we can not conclude for certain what kind of branched polymers were obtained in our simulations .",
    "it is preferable to find other quantities to observe the branched polymer phase more clearly .",
    "for example , in the case of a higher genus the moduli of the surface is one of the most important quantities in order to distinguish the branched polymer@xcite .",
