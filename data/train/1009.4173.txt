    "the metal abundances of intra - cluster medium ( icm ) in groups and clusters carry a lot of information in understanding the chemical history and evolution of groups and clusters .",
    "recent x - ray observations allow us to measure temperature and metal abundance distributions in the icm based on the spatially resolved spectra .",
    "a large amount of metals of the icm are mainly produced by supernovae ( sne ) in early - type galaxies @xcite , which are classified roughly as type ia ( sne  ia ) and type ii ( sne  ii ) .",
    "because si and fe are both synthesized in sne ia and ii , we need to know o and mg abundances , which are synthesized predominantly in sne ii , in resolving the past metal enrichment process in icm by supernovae . in order to know how the icm has been enriched ,",
    "we need to measure the amount and distribution of all the metals from o to fe in the icm .",
    "@xcite and @xcite summarized iron - mass - to - light ratios ( imlr ) with b - band luminosity for various objects with asca , as a function of their plasma temperature serving as a measure of the system richness , and imlrs in groups were found to be smaller than those in clusters .",
    "they also showed that the early - type galaxies released a large amount of metals which were probably formed through past supernovae explosions as shown earlier by @xcite . in order to obtain a correct modeling of icm , we need to know the correct temperature and metal abundance profiles without biases ( e.g. , @xcite ) . especially for the icm of cooler systems , such as elliptical galaxies and groups of galaxies , careful analysis",
    "are required as mentioned in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the spatial distribution and elemental abundance pattern of the icm metals were determined with the large effective area of xmm - newton @xcite . on the other hand , the abundance measurements of o and",
    "mg with xmm - newton were possible only for the central regions of brightest cooling core clusters due to the relatively high intrinsic background . @xcite report the si and fe profiles of 15 groups of galaxies observed with chandra .",
    "they suggest that the si to fe ratios in groups tend to increase with radius , and the imlrs within @xmath5 show a positive correlation with total group mass ( temperature ) .",
    "suzaku xis can measure all the main elements from o to fe , because it realizes lower background level and higher spectral sensitivity , especially below 1 kev @xcite .",
    "suzaku observations have shown the abundance profiles of o , mg , si , s , and fe to the outer regions with good precision for several clusters @xcite . combining the suzaku results with supernova nucleosynthesis models",
    ", @xcite showed the number ratios of sne  ii to ia to be  3.5 .",
    "ngc  1550 is a s0 galaxy and one of the nearest ( @xmath6 ) x - ray bright galaxies .",
    "the ngc  1550 is also classified as a fossil group @xcite , and an x - ray extended object rx j0419 + 0225 was first discovered by the rosat all sky survey from a position centered on the ngc  1550 galaxy . from asca observation @xcite , the mlrs with b - band is comparable to those of clusters .",
    "@xcite reports the temperature drop at the central region and also declines beyond 0.1 times of the virial radius , @xmath7 , with chandra observation .",
    "@xcite shows the gas mass and metal mass from the temperature and metal abundances observed with xmm - newton .",
    "in addition , they derived the mass - to - light ratios of o , si , and fe with near infrared ( k - band ) luminosity .",
    "the resultant imlr within @xmath8 kpc exhibits about 2 orders of magnitude decrease toward the center .",
    "ngc  1550 , such a fossil group , is a important object to investigate how the metals have been enriched to the icm , because of little metal supply from the present - day member galaxies .",
    "this paper reports on results from suzaku observations of ngc  1550 out to @xmath9  kpc , corresponding to @xmath10 .",

    "suzaku observed the central and offset regions of ngc  1550 in august 2008 ( pi :  k. sato ) .",
    "the observation logs are given in table  [ tab:1 ] , and the xis image in 0.52  kev is shown in figure  [ fig:1 ] .",
    "we analyzed only the xis data in this paper , because the temperature of the hxd pin is slightly higher during the observations .",
    "the xis instrument consists of three sets of x - ray ccds ( xis  0 , 1 , and 3 ) .",
    "xis  1 is a back - illuminated ( bi ) sensor , while xis  0 and 3 are front - illuminated ( fi ) .",
    "the instrument was operated in the normal clocking mode ( 8  s exposure per frame ) , with the standard @xmath19 or @xmath20 editing mode . during these observations , the significant effect of the solar wind charge exchange ( swcx )",
    "was not confirmed in ace data , although it was known that the swcx affected the suzaku spectra in the lower energy range as reported in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used version 2.2 processing data , and the analysis was performed with heasoft version 6.6.3 and xspec 12.5.0ac . here",
    "we give just a brief description of the data reduction .",
    "the light curve of each sensor in the 0.310  kev range with a 16  s time bin was also examined in order to exclude periods with anomalous event rates which were greater or less than @xmath21 around the mean to remove the charge exchange contamination @xcite , while suzaku data was little affected by the soft proton flare compared with xmm data .",
    "the exposure after the screening was essentially the same as that before screening in table  [ tab:1 ] , which indicated that the non x - ray background ( nxb ) was almost stable during the observation .",
    "event screening with cut - off rigidity ( cor ) was not performed in our data . in order to subtract the nxb and the extra - galactic cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) , we employed the dark earth database by the `` xisnxbgen '' ftools task .",
    "we generated two ancillary response files ( arfs ) for the spectrum of each annular sky region , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , which respectively assumed uniform sky emission and @xmath24 size of the @xmath25-model surface brightness profile , @xmath26 and @xmath27 , in @xcite , by the `` xissimarfgen '' ftools task @xcite .",
    "we also included the effect of the contaminations on the optical blocking filter of the xiss in the arfs .",
    "since the energy resolution also slowly degraded after the launch , due to radiation damage , this effect was included in the redistribution matrix file ( rmf ) by the `` xisrmfgen '' ftools task .",

    "each annular spectrum is shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "the ionized mg , si , s , fe lines are clearly seen in each region .",
    "the o and o lines were prominent in the outer rings , however , most of the o line was considered to come from the local galactic emission , and we dealt with those in the same way as mentioned in @xcite .",
    "the spectra with bi and fi for all regions were fitted simultaneously in the energy range , 0.47.1/0.45.0 kev ( bi ) and 0.67.1/0.65.0 ( fi ) for the central / offset observations , respectively . in the simultaneous fit",
    ", the common galactic emission and cxb components were included for all regions .",
    "we excluded the narrow energy band around the si k - edge ( 1.8251.840  kev ) because its response was not modeled correctly .",
    "the energy range below 0.4  kev was also excluded because the c edge ( 0.284  kev ) seen in the bi spectra could not be reproduced well in our data .",
    "the range above 7.1  kev was also ignored because ni line ( @xmath29  kev ) in the background left a spurious feature after the nxb subtraction at large radii . in the simultaneous fits of bi and fi data , only the normalization parameter was allowed to take different values between them .",
    "it is important to estimate the galactic component precisely , because the galactic component gives significant contribution especially in the outer regions , as shown in figure  [ fig:2 ] .",
    "however , the icm component is still dominant in almost all the energy range except for the o line .",
    "we assumed two temperature _ apec _ model ( assuming 1 solar abundance and zero redshift ) for the galactic component , and fitted the data with the following model formula : @xmath30 as shown in @xcite . as a result , the best - fit temperatures of 0.098 and 0.219 kev for the galactic models as shown in table [ tab:2 ] are consistent with the values as shown in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "thus , we concluded that the two temperature model of the galactic emission was enough to represent ngc  1550 data .",
    "the resultant normalizations of the _ apec _ models in table  [ tab:2 ] are scaled so that they give the surface brightness in unit solid angle of arcmin@xmath31 , and are constrained to give the same surface brightness and the same temperature for the simultaneous fits of all annuli '' in table 5 in @xcite are an order of magnitude larger than the actual values . ] .",

    "the resultant k - band luminosity within the suzaku observed region , @xmath74 , is @xmath75 , and the radial luminosity profile is also plotted in figure  [ fig:7](a ) .",
    "we calculated the radial profile of the omlr , imlr , and mmlr values using the k - band luminosity out to a radius @xmath76  kpc ( @xmath77 ) , as shown in figure  [ fig:7](b ) and table  [ tab:6 ] .",
    "the values at the outermost radius are @xmath78 , @xmath79 , and @xmath80 @xmath81 , respectively .    in order to investigate the dependence on the system size , we compared the mlrs of ngc  1550 ( @xmath82 kev ) with those of ngc  5044 ( 1 kev ) and abell  262 ( 2 kev ) , which are all poor relaxed cooling - core groups and clusters .",
    "although they show similar imlr in the inner region , ngc  1550 and abell  262 show gas mass ratio to the k - band luminosity higher than ngc  5044 , as shown in figure  [ fig:7](a ) .",
    "as one goes outside ( @xmath83 ) , ngc  1550 shows fairly consistent mlrs with abell  262 , larger than those in ngc  5044 as shown in figure  [ fig:6](b ) .",
    "the radial profiles of imlr and omlr for ngc  1550 look quite similar to those for abell  262 rather than for ngc  5044 .",
    "the radius , @xmath84 , corresponds to the region where the gas mass and k - band luminosity seem to overlap as shown in figure  [ fig:7](a ) . assuming the stellar mass - to - light ratio , @xmath85 as shown in @xcite ( see also @xcite )",
    ", this radius indeed corresponds to the point where the gas and stellar masses are comparable .",
    "the similarity of mlrs for the 3 systems examined here in the inner region ( @xmath4 ) suggests that the metal enrichment within the past few gyr has occurred in a similar way .",
    "on the other hand , in the outer region ( @xmath83 ) , ngc  5044 shows lower imlr than those in ngc  1550 and abell  262 , even though fe abundances themselves are comparable in these regions .",
    "this suggests that distribution of stellar mass has some different history between these systems .",
    "we will consider how the observed features of abundance and mlr profiles can constrain enrichment scenario .",
    "first , metals in the inner region ( @xmath86 ) have been mostly supplied by the central galaxy , so this region should be set aside in the present discussion . in the immediate outer region ( @xmath87 )",
    ", metals from the central galaxy could not reach in a few gyr time scale .",
    "also , we may assume that almost the same amount of metals per stellar mass was synthesized in all systems before the collapse of groups and clusters .",
    "in this case , we expect very similar mlrs in different systems , contrary to the observed feature .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig:7](b ) , at least ngc  5044 shows lower imlr and omlr profiles compared with those for two other systems .",
    "this implies that the thermal and/or dynamical evolutions of the gas have different history among different systems during or after the collapsing period of individual groups and clusters .",
    "@xcite showed the expected mlrs as a function of the imf slope .",
    "as for omlr , the expected value to be @xmath88 at a salpeter imf is slightly higher than our results of @xmath89 within @xmath90 as shown in figure [ fig:6](b ) .",
    "however , as shown in figure [ fig:7](b ) , because the omlrs look increasing toward outer region , the omlrs within the virial radius would be represented with the salpeter imf . @xcite also suggested that a top heavy imf would overproduce metals by more than a factor of 20 , which is much larger than the observed values including our results .",
    "we stress that high - sensitivity abundance observation to the outer region of clusters will give important clues about their evolution . if o distribution , as well as fe , could be measured to the very outer region ( @xmath91 ) , we may obtain a clear view about when o and fe were supplied to the inter galactic space because most of o should have been synthesized by sne ii and supplied in the starburst era .",
    "another possibility is very early metal enrichment of o by galaxies or massive population iii stars ( e.g.@xcite ) before groups and clusters assemble . in this case",
    ", a large part of the intergalactic space would be enriched quite uniformly with o and other elements .",
    "metallicity information in cluster outskirts would thus give us unique information about the enrichment history .",
    "for this purpose , instruments with much higher energy resolution , such as microcalorimeters , and optics with larger effective area will play a key role in carrying out these studies .",
    "suzaku observation of the fossil group ngc  1550 showed spatial distributions of temperature and metal abundances for o , mg , si , s , and fe up to @xmath92 for the first time , and confirmed that the metals in the icm of this fossil group are indeed extending to a large radius .",
    "the icm temperature decreases mildly from @xmath93 kev to @xmath94 kev in the outer region , similar to the feature seen in other clusters .",
    "the abundances of mg , si , s , and fe drop from subsolar levels at the center to @xmath95 solar in the outermost region , while the o abundance shows a flatter distribution around @xmath96 solar without the strong concentration in the center .",
    "the abundance ratios , o / fe , mg / fe , si / fe , and s / fe for ngc  1550 are generally similar to those in groups and poor clusters .",
    "the abundance pattern from o to fe enabled us to constrain number ratio of sne ii to ia as @xmath97 , which is consistent with the values obtained for other groups and clusters .",
    "the derived mlrs of ngc  1550 using the b - band and k - band luminosities are consistent with those in the ngc  5044 group for the inner region @xmath98 , while ngc  1550 shows slightly higher mlrs than ngc  5044 in the outer region .",
    "this suggests that metal enrichment process may reflect the size of the system in the sense that larger systems contain higher amount of metals for a given stellar mass .",
