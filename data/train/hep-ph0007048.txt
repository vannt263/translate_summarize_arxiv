    "theories with large extra compact dimensions offer new ways to accommodate the hierarchies observed in particle physics @xcite .",
    "they can be realized within a string theory @xcite , the only candidate for a consistent description of quantum gravity .",
    "phenomenologically , the nonstandard effects that extra dimensions imply can be supressed to acceptable levels by their size and their properties ( for example , an extra dimension could be invisible to some fields and not to others ) .",
    "in particular , the possibility of compact dimensions at scales @xmath5 has recently received a lot of attention .",
    "such dimensions , with @xmath6 below the string scale , could explain gauge unification @xcite or supersymmetry ( susy ) breaking @xcite .",
    "the momentum along a compact dimension is quantized in units of @xmath6 , and a higher dimensional field is seen in four dimensions as an infinite tower of kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes of mass @xmath7 .",
    "let us consider a theory where the gauge bosons can propagate along the extra dimensions .",
    "its low - energy limit will resemble an extension of the standard model ( sm ) with massive replications of all the gauge fields .",
    "the virtual exchange of these fields will introduce corrections of order @xmath8 to the interactions mediated by the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bosons and will change the sm relations between electroweak observables @xcite . for @xmath1 and compactification on a circle",
    "there are two states at each kk level @xmath11 .",
    "the exchange of the complete tower of resonances gives then corrections proportional to @xmath12 the main contribution in this sum is due to the lightest resonances and thus the result is not dependent on ultraviolet details .",
    "actually , the effect of the whole kk tower mimics the effect of a single resonance with @xmath13 .    however , the fact that there is an infinite tower of massive modes instead of just one state is specially relevant for more than one extra dimension . for @xmath2",
    "the number of excitations at each kk level grows with @xmath11 ( see below ) and the contribution from the heavy modes diverges .",
    "this divergence , related to the non renormalizability of higher dimensional gauge theories , implies that at larger scales the theory has to be embedded in a more fundamental framework .",
    "in particular , in string theory one would expect an exponential supression of the gauge coupling of the kk modes with masses above the string scale @xcite , which would act as an effective cutoff .    from the previous argument it seems to follow that , even if there is a gap between the compactification and the string scales ( as suggested by gauge unification ) , for @xmath2 the virtual exchange of kk modes is always going to be dominated by contributions near the cutoff , where genuine kk effects would be mixed with string effects .",
    "we will show that this is not the case .",
    "the heavy excitations of the gauge bosons have weaker couplings to fermions than the lighter modes , and for any value of @xmath0 the main contribution comes from the exchange of the fields in the lowest kk levels .",
    "the evolution of the gauge couplings with the scale depends essentially on the total number of excitations at each kk level .",
    "let us consider a model with @xmath0 compact dimensions with common radius @xmath14 .",
    "the momentum along the extra dimensions is given by the vector @xmath15 , where @xmath16 can take any integer value .",
    "this momentum is seen in four dimensions as the mass @xmath17 each kk mode _ occupies _ a point in a @xmath0dimensional reticle . to calculate the number @xmath18 of kk states with a mass smaller than @xmath19 we can approximate this discrete distribution by the averaged ( continuous ) one , and",
    "then @xmath18 is just the volume of a @xmath0dimensional sphere of radius @xmath11 : @xmath20 where the gamma function above satisfies @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , being @xmath0 a positive integer .",
    "the kk approach provides a simple framework to understand the running of the gauge couplings in 4+@xmath0 dimensions . at the lowest order",
    "the running is given by the one - loop contributions to the vector boson selfenergy .",
    "at each scale @xmath24 , we have to include in the loop the kk modes lighter than @xmath24 the one - loop corrections to the gauge couplings in the 5d theory almost coincide with the running in the truncated theory where the heavier modes have been cut off . the regularization dependence and kk threshold effects have been discussed in @xcite . ] . due to this multiplicity",
    "the renormalization group equations become @xmath25 where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 stand respectively for scalar , fermion and vector fields , @xmath31 for @xmath32 , and @xmath33 . the first equation ( the case with no kk resonances )",
    "gives a logarithmic dependence of @xmath34 on @xmath24 , whereas the second one predicts a much faster power - law behaviour : @xmath35    let us focus on the @xmath36 gauge coupling of a non - susy extension of the sm with @xmath0 extra dimensions where only gauge and higgs ( but not quark and lepton ) fields propagate . taking into account the additional degrees of freedom of a vector field in @xmath37 dimensions , we find @xmath38 .",
    "this negative beta function will make @xmath39 a decreasing funtion of the scale . from eq .",
    "( 5 ) it follows that , for large enough @xmath24 , @xmath40 decreases like @xmath41 . in fig .",
    "( 1 ) we plot the running of @xmath39 for @xmath42 tev and different values of @xmath0 .",
    "two comments are in order .",
    "first , the @xmath43 gauge coupling has a positive beta function ( due to higgs contributions only ) and it will grow with the scale",
    ". however , @xmath44 has initially a smaller value than @xmath39 , and both couplings will then coincide at a larger scale ( around @xmath45 for @xmath1 @xcite ) .",
    "this suggests unification into a larger gauge group , like @xmath46 or @xmath47 , where yang - mills interactions would provide for a negative beta function and a weaker coupling at higher scales .",
    "second , we would like to mention the susy case . here",
    "one needs to take into account the different field content of a fermion in higher dimensions : a minimum of four components if @xmath48 or eight components for larger @xmath0 @xcite . in the first two cases the matter content can be accommodated in complete 4dimensional multiplets of @xmath49 susy :",
    "vector superfields @xmath30 will come together with a chiral superfield @xmath50 in the adjoint representation of the gauge group , whereas the higgs doublets will come in pairs @xmath51 of chiral superfields .",
    "the generic susy beta function with @xmath52 becomes now @xmath53 , with @xmath54 for @xmath36 .",
    "we include the @xmath48 cases in fig .",
    "( 1 ) . for larger @xmath0 , the higher dimensional fields complete hypermultiplets of @xmath55 susy , including a vector plus three chiral superfields all in the adjoint representation of the group . in such scenario one",
    "is forced to extend the @xmath36 gauge symmetry to have higgs doublets .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 theories are finite and the beta function vanishes @xcite .",
    "however , the spectrum of zero modes as well as the interactions of the fermion fields living in 4 dimensions will break the @xmath55 susy and at the two - loop level will give nonzero beta functions with a model dependent sign @xcite .",
    "as shown in the previous section , the gauge couplings decrease like a power law with the scale , implying that heavier kk modes couple to fermions with smaller strength",
    ". this will give an important correction to the cumulative effects of the kk tower on electroweak observables .",
    "in particular , let us consider the fermi coupling measured in muon decays .",
    "its definition will include now the exchange of the @xmath10 boson and its excitations : @xmath56 the sum above can be approximated by an integral .",
    "the number of modes @xmath57 at the @xmath11 level ( _ i.e. _ , with a mass in the interval @xmath58 ; notice that @xmath59 is not necesarily an integer number ) is @xmath60 then @xmath61 where we have introduced a cutoff mass @xmath62 . since the number @xmath57 of excitations with mass @xmath24 grows proportional to @xmath63 ,",
    "if the running of @xmath39 is neglected the integral @xmath64 converges only for @xmath1 and diverges like @xmath65 for @xmath66 and like @xmath67 for larger @xmath0 .",
    "however , @xmath39 decreases proportional to @xmath41 at large @xmath24 . taking into account the weaker coupling to quarks and lepton of the heavy modes",
    ", the dependence of the integral on the cutoff vanishes like @xmath68 for all @xmath0 and the result is always finite .    in fig .",
    "( 2 ) we plot the value of @xmath64 for @xmath42 tev and different values of @xmath0 .",
    "we also plot @xmath69 , the result that would be obtained neglecting the running of the gauge coupling ( _ i.e. _ , replacing @xmath70 by @xmath71 in eq .",
    "the figure shows that the running is very effective in suppressing the effect of heavier modes .",
    "in particular , we find that more than @xmath4 of the total correction to @xmath72 comes from the excitations in the 6 lowest kk levels for @xmath1 and @xmath73 or from the 7 lowest levels for @xmath66 .",
    "the kk effects are then insensitive to physics beyond @xmath74 .    in fig .",
    "( 3 ) we plot the ratio @xmath75 , which gives the correction to kk effects due to the running of @xmath39 . in the case with @xmath1 , the most extensively considered in the literature @xcite , the running reduces the kk effects on @xmath72 ( and the bound on @xmath76 ) in just a @xmath3 ( or an @xmath77 for a cutoff @xmath78 ) .",
    "however , for @xmath66 the correction is a factor of 0.63 if @xmath79 and a factor of 0.09 for @xmath73 with @xmath80 .",
    "bounds on new physics from precision electroweak data are usually obtained from analysis that combine new physics at the tree level with standard model effects at one loop .",
    "we have shown that in models with extra dimensions at the tev scale this procedure is in general not justified . at the one - loop level the gauge couplings experience @xmath81 power - law corrections that decouple the heavy kk modes .",
    "we find that for @xmath1 the running of @xmath39 accounts for a small reduction ( around @xmath3 ) of the tree - level kk effect on @xmath72 , but for @xmath2 it makes finite an effect that diverges at the tree level .",
    "the divergent tree - level result is just expressing that these ( non - renormalizable ) higher dimensional extensions of the sm should be embedded at larger scales in a string theory .",
    "our result , however , shows that including the one - loop running of the gauge couplings it is not necessary to introduce an ultraviolet cutoff in order to cure these pathologies .",
    "kk effects on electroweak observables are insensitive to the value of the ultraviolet cutoff or to the way the theory is embedded on the fundamental theory if the larger scale is @xmath82 .",
