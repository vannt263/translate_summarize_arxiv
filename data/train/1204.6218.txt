    "particle detectors based on liquid argon , first developed in the 1970 s for calorimetry and tracking  @xcite , have recently become recognized as an extremely attractive technology for the direct detection of dark matter  @xcite .",
    "this was in large part due to the strong pulse shape discrimination ( psd ) possible with liquid argon scintillation  @xcite .",
    "particles interacting in argon induce excitation and ionization of the medium , leading to the emission of scintillation light whose time structure is strongly correlated with the nature of the interaction  @xcite .",
    "this provides a way to detect rare nuclear recoil events , possibly induced by weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) , a well - motivated galactic dark matter candidate .",
    "such events must be identified in the presence of an overwhelming background of low - ionization - density electron - induced events from background @xmath2 and @xmath3 radioactivity . with sufficient photon statistics",
    ", psd can allow discrimination of nuclear recoil events from electron - induced background events at better than @xmath4  @xcite . if realized in a low - background detector , this offers a natural route to a sensitive dark matter search .    because the efficiency of the psd is so strongly dependent on the number of detected scintillation photons ,",
    "much of the recent r&d activity in the field has been aimed at improving the light collection of liquid - argon - based detectors .",
    "the darkside project is a direct detection dark matter search at laboratori nazionali del gran sasso ( lngs ) .",
    "it will be based on the use of a two - phase time projection chamber ( tpc ) filled with argon from underground sources , strongly depleted in the naturally occurring @xmath5ar radioisotope  @xcite .",
    "the detector will be coupled with a borated liquid scintillator neutron veto , resulting in a detector capable of achieving background - free operation in an extended run  @xcite .",
    "darkside-50 , currently being commissioned with an active mass of 50 kg , will be the first physics - capable detector in the darkside program . in order to develop and optimize the two - phase argon time projection technology , a dedicated 10-kg prototype ( ds-10 )",
    "was built at princeton university .",
    "after seven months of running at princeton , the ds-10 detector was deployed at lngs during the spring of 2011 .",
    "we report measurements of its light yield , performed during the first underground data campaign , july - december , 2011 .",
    "scintillation in liquid argon results from the radiative decays of excited molecular dimers , ar@xmath6 , formed after the passage of charged particles .",
    "an excited dimer may be formed in either a singlet or a triplet state , which have very different radiative decay lifetimes , @xmath7 ns for the singlet and @xmath8 @xmath9s for the triplet  @xcite .",
    "the relative population of the fast ( singlet ) and slow ( triplet ) components is strongly correlated with the ionization density and hence the nature of the primary ionizing particle and the deposited energy  @xcite .",
    "the typical fraction of the scintillation light in the fast component is @xmath10 for nuclear recoil events , which are heavily - ionizing , and @xmath11 for electron - mediated events  this is the basis of pulse shape discrimination .",
    "the rejection power achievable by psd is strongly affected by the amount of light detected .",
    "this is due to the growing statistical precision with which the fast and slow component populations can be determined for any event type as the total number of detected photons increases .",
    "consequently , the overall light collection and detection efficiency becomes a crucial figure of merit for the performance of these detectors . with the common use of photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) as light sensors , the overall light yield is often expressed in terms of the number of detected photoelectrons ( p.e . ) per kev of energy deposited in the argon .",
    "this number , which in general depends on the nature of the ionizing particle and on the applied electric field , is usually quoted for electron recoil events at null field , and expressed in units of p.e./kev@xmath1 ( for  electron equivalent \" energy ) . in absolute terms",
    ", the detector light yield can be compared to the raw photon yield in liquid argon , @xmath12 scintillation photons per kev@xmath1 deposited  @xcite .",
    "this scintillation light is peaked in the uv at 128 nm .",
    "we measure the light yield of the ds-10 detector by studying the scintillation spectra from radioactive @xmath2 sources deployed outside the cryostat . by normalizing the integrated signal on each pmt to the average integral corresponding to a single photoelectron",
    ", the light yield of the detector can be estimated from the spectral features of the @xmath2 sources .",
    "the darkside-10 detector , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds-10 ] , is a two - phase ( liquid and gas ) tpc  @xcite , incorporating several innovative design features intended to improve stability , simplicity , and performance .",
    "the device consists of an acrylic / fused silica vessel which contains the two - phase sensitive region .",
    "this  inner vessel \" is completely immersed in a liquid argon ( lar ) bath contained in a vacuum - insulated stainless steel dewar .",
    "the pmts are in the outer lar bath , viewing the active volume of lar through the inner vessel .",
    "the inner vessel consists of an open - ended acrylic cylinder of 23.5  cm height , 24.1  cm inner diameter , and 1.9  cm wall thickness , sealed by ptfe - encapsulated steel - spring creavey o - rings at the top and bottom to fused silica windows , 1.3  cm thick  @xcite .",
    "the cylinder and windows are clamped together by a cage of spring - loaded , 0.95-cm - diameter stainless steel rods .",
    "the resulting seal is sufficiently  bubble tight \" to contain the argon gas pocket required for two - phase operation .",
    "the gas for the pocket is produced in a tube running vertically alongside the acrylic cylinder .",
    "lar purified in the recirculation loop ( see below ) enters the tube and is boiled by a resistor operating at about one watt .",
    "a connecting pipe delivers the gas to the top of the inner vessel .",
    "the gas - liquid interface level is passively maintained 2.0 cm below the top fused silica window by a bubbler tube that vents gas from the pocket and ends in the lar bath at the desired height .",
    "the liquid level is continuously measured by a set of discrete pt-1000 thermistors and a capacitive level sensor in the boiling tube . under normal operating conditions , including gas recirculation to the inner and outer vessels , the fluctuations in inner vessel liquid level are @xmath13 mm .",
    "the active volume of the detector , 21 cm in diameter , is defined by a reflector lining the acrylic cylinder .",
    "the reflector is made of overlapping sheets of 3 m vikuiti esr  @xcite , a multilayer plastic foil , mounted inside a ptfe frame .    to detect the 128 nm argon scintillation light",
    ", we use the wavelength shifter tetraphenyl butadiene ( tpb ) , with a peak emission wavelength of 420 nm  @xcite .",
    "the tpb fluorescence decay time is @xmath14  ns , short compared to the 7 ns fast component of the lar scintillation  @xcite .",
    "tpb is deposited by vacuum evaporation onto the reflector lining the acrylic cylinder and the inner surfaces of the fused silica windows .",
    "the stainless steel mesh separating the electron drift and extraction regions of the tpc ( described below ) , a few @xmath15 of the reflector covered by @xmath16 sources , and small gaps at the edges of the reflectors caused by differential thermal contraction are the only non - tpb - coated surfaces seen by the uv scintillation light from the active argon volume .",
    "measurements in a vacuum - uv spectrophotometer suggested an optimum tpb thickness of about 200@xmath9g/@xmath15 , a tradeoff between high uv - to - visible conversion efficiency and low absorption of the visible light .",
    "the reflector and windows were coated with 230 - 260 and 215 - 230 @xmath9g/@xmath15 of tpb , respectively .",
    "the evaporations were performed in a large high - vacuum chamber using a knudsen effusion cell .",
    "the typical vacuum level reached prior to the evaporation was ( 2 - 7)@xmath17 torr .",
    "after the evaporation the parts were kept in sealed bags filled with dry argon . during the detector assembly we took care to minimize exposure of tpb - coated surfaces to air , since degradation was noted during optical - bench testing .",
    "we accomplished this by flushing the inner vessel with argon gas throughout the assembly procedure .",
    "the fused silica windows were coated about three months before the measurements reported here began .",
    "the reflecting foils were coated 9 months before the run and were used in the preceding 3-month run in princeton .",
    "wavelength - shifted scintillation light is collected by two arrays of seven hamamatsu high - quantum - efficiency r11065 3  pmts  @xcite , viewing the active volume through the top and bottom fused silica windows . a @xmath181 mm layer of lar optically couples the pmts to the windows .",
    "these fused - silica - window , metal - bulb tubes are operated at negative hv and are electrically insulated from the surrounding materials with ptfe spacers .",
    "the pmts have hamamatsu - reported room - temperature quantum efficiencies at 420 nm ranging from 30.4 to 35.7% , with an average of 33.9% .",
    "they are run at a typical gain of @xmath19 with lines terminated in 50 ohm at both ends . to enhance the light collection ,",
    "the spaces between the phototubes are filled with 1.3-cm - thick ptfe reflectors , and the small exposed areas of the stainless steel endplates are covered with 3 m vikuiti foil .",
    "to allow the device to be operated as a time projection chamber , the inner vessel is equipped with a set of high voltage electrodes and a distribution system to provide the necessary electric fields in the sensitive volume to drift electrons to the surface of the liquid , to extract them into the gas , and to accelerate them through the gas producing a secondary scintillation signal proportional to the collected ionization .",
    "the electrodes fixing the potential at boundaries of the chamber are : a transparent indium tin oxide ( ito ) cathode on the inner surface of the bottom window , a kapton flexible printed circuit board with overlapping etched copper strips alternating between the two sides wrapped around the acrylic cylinder , an etched stainless steel grid 5 mm below the liquid - gas surface , and an ito anode on the bottom surface of the top window . for tpc operation , the anode is grounded and independently - controllable voltages on the cathode and grid set the drift and extraction fields , while a chain of resistors between the copper strips creates the graded potential that keeps the drift field uniform . to shield the negatively - biased pmt photocathodes from the voltages applied to the anode and cathode ,",
    "each fused silica window carries a second ito layer on its external face .",
    "these are maintained at approximately the average of the pmt photocathode voltages .    to obtain the light yield measurements presented here , the tpc anode , grid , and cathode as well as the field shaping copper strips have all been kept at ground potential , giving null drift , extraction , and multiplication fields . in the rest of the paper",
    "this will be referred as the _ null field _ configuration . in this configuration",
    "the device operates as a pure lar scintillation detector .",
    "the tpc system nonetheless affects the scintillation optics .",
    "the measurements presented here were made with the gas pocket present , and the gas pocket affects the light propagation , primarily through total internal reflection in the lar . the grid is a 100-@xmath9m - thick stainless steel membrane etched with a hexagonal pattern of through holes 0.5 cm on a side , with an optical transparency for normally incident light of 89% .",
    "the ito layers are 15 nm thick , the thinest thought feasible by the vendor .",
    "since ito conducts , it has a complex index of refraction that results in absorption . at 420 nm ,",
    "calculations give an absorption of 2% per layer at normal incidence , and all light must pass through at least two layers to reach the pmts .",
    "a 90-w cryomech pt90 cryocooler is connected to a cold - head inside the dewar but outside the inner vessel .",
    "the cold head provides the cooling power needed both to cool and condense argon gas in the detector during filling and to control the liquid argon temperature during normal operation .",
    "the cold - head is instrumented with a temperature sensor and a 100-w heater which are part of a feedback loop controlled by a lakeshore 430 temperature controller .",
    "this allows the temperature of the system to be maintained at the boiling point of liquid argon ( 87.8 k ) with typical fluctuations less than 0.1k .",
    "dissolved impurities such as nitrogen , oxygen , and water are known to strongly affect the scintillation properties of liquid argon  @xcite .",
    "the purity of the active argon in ds-10 is established and maintained by a number of measures .",
    "before the detector is cooled , the dewar is repeatedly flushed and pumped over several days at room temperature using research grade ( 99.999% ) argon gas and a dry turbopump , achieving a final pressure of about @xmath20 mbar .",
    "this removes adsorbed impurities from metal surfaces and reduces subsequent outgassing from the internal plastic parts .",
    "research grade atmosphericar - depleted underground argon being extracted for the darkside dark matter detectors  @xcite . ]",
    "argon gas is also used for the fill .",
    "the gas is further purified by a single pass through a saes monotorr ps4-mt3-r1 getter which is sized and configured to reduce o@xmath21 , n@xmath21 , and h@xmath21o impurities to sub - ppb levels  @xcite . during operation ,",
    "argon purity is maintained by continuous gas recirculation : a metal bellows pump forces the boil - off argon from the dewar through the monotorr getter , at about 15  slpm , and send it back to the cold - head for recondensation .",
    "the data acquisition system consists of a set of 12 bit , 250 ms / s , digitizers ( caen 1720 ) which record the signals from each of the 14 photomultiplier tubes and store them for offline analysis . to trigger the system ,",
    "the anode signal from each pmt is first amplified tenfold by a lecroy 612a fast amplifier with two parallel outputs .",
    "one output goes directly into the digitizer channel which runs continuously , filling a circular memory buffer . in the digitizer",
    ", one sample at one count represents 0.0078 pc from the pmt .",
    "the other output is used to form a majority trigger .",
    "this requires a coincidence , within 100 ns , of at least 5 pmts with signals above a threshold : the latter is set independently on each channel to about 1/3@xmath22 of the photoelectron mean amplitude .",
    "when an event satisfies the majority trigger condition , data in the 14 circular buffers representing a 35  @xmath9s time window ( 5  @xmath9s before the trigger and 30  @xmath9s after ) , is downloaded to a pc and stored on a local hard disk .",
    "the acquired window length for the null field configuration has been selected to fully contain the slow component of the scintillation light , while also including relatively large pre- and post - trigger regions to allow for baseline evaluation .",
    "the charge response of each pmt to a single photoelectron is evaluated using a laser calibration procedure , which was repeated frequently among the data runs analyzed here .",
    "light pulses of @xmath1870 ps duration at 440 nm wavelength from a diode laser are injected into the detector through an optical fiber that terminates on the bottom window of the inner vessel .",
    "diffuse reflection from the tpb leads to a roughly uniform illumination of the 14 pmts .",
    "the controller pulses the laser at a rate of 1000 hz and simultaneously triggers the data acquisition system .",
    "optical filters are placed between the laser and the fiber to adjust the intensity until the average number of photoelectrons generated on each tube in any given trigger , referred to as the average occupancy , is roughly 0.1 .",
    "unlike regular data runs , the digitization window for laser runs is only 1.5 @xmath9s long . within this record , a 0.8 @xmath9s period before the pulse arrival time",
    "is used to define the baseline .",
    "after subtraction of this baseline , the integral of the recorded waveform is evaluated within a fixed 92-ns window around the arrival time of the laser pulse . the resulting charge spectrum for each pmt",
    "is then fitted to a model function , allowing the mean of the single - photoelectron charge response to be determined .",
    "the fitting function used is @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a poisson distribution with mean @xmath25 , representing the average occupancy , and @xmath26 the @xmath27-photoelectron charge ( @xmath28 ) response of the system .",
    "we have modeled the @xmath27-photoelectron response of the system as @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the zero photoelectron response ( pedestal ) , @xmath31 is a convolution , and @xmath32 is the @xmath27-fold convolution of the pmt single - photoelectron response function , @xmath33 , with itself .",
    "the function representing the pedestal , @xmath30 , the integral in the absence of any photoelectrons and thus the entire @xmath34 term , is described by a gaussian , while the pmt single - photoelectron response , @xmath33 , is modeled by the weighted sum of a decaying exponential and a gaussian , truncated at zero , @xmath35 the gaussian term @xmath36 represents the single - photoelectron response from the full dynode chain , while the exponential term accounts for incomplete dynode multiplication  @xcite .",
    "the fit is performed with seven free parameters : the average occupancy @xmath25 , the mean and standard deviation of the pedestal gaussian , the mean @xmath37 and standard deviation @xmath38 of the single - photoelectron gaussian , the decay constant @xmath39 of the single - photoelectron exponential component , and the relative weight @xmath40 between the single - photoelectron gaussian and exponential terms . in order to simplify the computation , for @xmath41 the function @xmath32",
    "is approximated by a gaussian whose mean and variance are @xmath27 times that of the single - photoelectron response @xmath33 .",
    "figure  [ fig : laser_fit ] shows a sample spectrum and fit for a laser run on a single channel . due to the presence of the exponential term ,",
    "the mean of the single - photoelectron response is , on average , 13% lower than that of the gaussian single - photoelectron component alone .",
    "for each individual channel , we determine a baseline and subtract it from the digitized waveform . because argon scintillation pulses extend over several microseconds and eventually taper into sparse , individual photoelectrons , this needs careful treatment .",
    "the baseline is calculated by two different methods .",
    "the first , referred as the _ linear - baseline _ method , calculates the average of the digitized samples in a gate at least 1.0  @xmath9s wide before the trigger in the acquisition window ( where no signal is expected ) and , when possible , at the end of it , using a linear interpolation between these two values as the baseline in the region in between .",
    "if the two values differ by more than 1 adc count , the event is rejected .",
    "the second algorithm uses a moving average , over a window of length 80  ns , to calculate a local baseline in regions where the waveform fluctuations are consistent with electronic noise . in regions where sharp excursions are found ( such as under scintillation pulses , including single photoelectrons ) the baseline is linearly interpolated between the most recent quiet intervals",
    "this _ moving - average baseline _ is intended to remove slowly varying fluctuations , such as possible low - frequency interference .",
    "once the baseline has been subtracted , the waveform for each channel is divided by the corresponding single photoelectron mean , as obtained from the nearest laser calibration run .",
    "the scaled waveforms from all 14 channels are then added together to form a summed waveform which is further analyzed to identify scintillation pulses .",
    "the scintillation - pulse finding algorithm identifies a pulse start time and end time for the scintillation signal and , once the start and end times of the pulse are found , the integral in that interval is evaluated independently for each of the 14 scaled channels and these integrals are summed to give an estimate of the total number of photoelectrons of the scintillation event .",
    "events with known energy depositions are obtained by exposing the detector to a series of external radioactive @xmath2 sources .",
    "the gamma sources are collimated by means of a 45.5-mm - thick lead collimator with a 10 mm diameter hole .",
    "three collimator positions along the vertical direction are used : _ bottom _ , _ central _ , and _ top _ , corresponding to 20  mm , 105  mm , and 158  mm from the tpc cathode . due to the large amount of material between the source collimator ( located outside the lar dewar ) and the active volume , as well as the relatively large size of the sensitive region ,",
    "the spectra are degraded , leaving full - absorption peaks as the most visible and reliable features for light yield estimates .",
    ".@xmath2 energies and intensities  @xcite , and activities of sources used .",
    "the 511-kev @xmath42na line results from positron annihilation resulting in two back - to - back 511-kev @xmath2 rays . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "the light yield reported here greatly exceeds that measured in the previous run of ds-10 , about 4.5  p.e./kev@xmath1 .",
    "since the previous run , a number of modifications were made to the detector .",
    "the most relevant of these were the replacement of the bottom pmt array and the replacement of the top and bottom windows . in the previous run ,",
    "the bottom pmt array consisted of a single 8 `` hamamatsu r5912 - 02 pmt .",
    "this was replaced with an array of 7 3 '' r11065s , matching the top array .",
    "the new array had less photocathode coverage ( partly compensated by filling the gaps between the 3 \" pmts with ptfe reflectors ) , but much higher quantum efficiency ( averaging 33.9% vs.  18% ) . in the previous run , the windows were acrylic , with 100-nm - thick ito on both sides . a 100 nm ito layer is calculated to absorb 10% of 420 nm light at normal incidence , with a large effect on the light yield when multiple passes and non - normal incidence were considered . however , thinner coatings were not recommended on acrylic .",
    "the replacement windows , fused silica with 15-nm ito , were expected to provide considerably better light yield .    as described in sec .",
    "[ sec : spe ] the light yields reported here depend directly on the single - photoelectron calibration , in which the response was fitted to the single - p.e .",
    "model of eq .",
    "[ eq : pdf ] .",
    "the first , exponential , term lowers the single - p.e .",
    "mean , and thus raises the inferred number of p.e . in a signal of a given integrated charge .",
    "the presence of such a term in the single - p.e .",
    "response of the pmt s is motivated by structure below the single - p.e .",
    "peak observed to be correlated with laser activity .",
    "however , its inclusion in the light yield may not be appropriate for all applications , notably those that count single photoelectrons above some threshold . as discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : spe ] , including less of the exponential term is at most a 13% effect .",
    "the light yield achieved in darkside-10 , 9.142@xmath00.006(stat)@xmath00.457(sys )  p.e./kev@xmath1 after the purification campaign , is well in excess of the light yields proposed in reference  @xcite and assumed in the background calculations for the 50-kg darkside-50  @xcite .",
    "it demonstrates that excellent light yield can be achieved in the elaborate structure of a tpc .",
