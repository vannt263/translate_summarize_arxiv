    "in the present paper , we investigate systems of dirac electrons on a bipartite planar lattice possessing competing superconducting and excitonic interactions .",
    "excitonic pairing is the analog of chiral symmetry breaking of relativistic fermion theories and produces an insulating gap in the electronic spectrum .",
    "superconducting pairing , as we know , leads to zero resistance charge transport . condensed matter systems with such competing interactions display phenomena that are analogous to the onset of the chiral condensate and of color superconductivity in dense quark matter , which is an active subject of investigation  @xcite .",
    "the phase transitions obtained in such systems can be compared with the ones occurring in analog condensed matter systems with dirac fermions .",
    "indeed , several condensed matter systems have been discovered in recent years whose active electrons have their kinematics governed by the dirac equation , rather than by the schrdinger equation .",
    "their dispersion relation , accordingly , has the same form as that of a relativistic particle .",
    "the reason for this unusual behavior of electrons whose speed is at least two orders of magnitude less than the speed of light can be ascribed to a particular influence of the lattice background on the electronic properties .",
    "one early example of such dirac electrons in condensed matter can be found in polyacetylene  @xcite .",
    "the undoped system is in the half - filling regime . if we expand the one - dimensional lattice tight - binding energy about the two fermi points we obtain the linear dispersion relation associated to a massless relativistic particle , the two components of the dirac field corresponding to left and right moving electrons . within a large temperature range",
    ", any electronic excitations will have such a dispersion relation and consequently will obey the dirac equation .",
    "in the high - tc cuprate superconductors , dirac points appear in the intersection of the nodes of the @xmath0-wave superconducting gap and the 2d - fermi surface .",
    "again , the low - energy excitations will correspond exclusively to these points  @xcite .",
    "quite recently , it has been experimentally found that the newest high - tc superconductors , namely the iron pnictides  @xcite also present electronic excitations whose properties are governed by the dirac equation .",
    "theoretical results also support the existence of dirac electrons in the pnictides  @xcite .",
    "another interesting example is that of graphene  @xcite , in this case the tight - binding energy corresponding to an electron in the honeycomb lattice presents a band structure such that the valence and conduction bands touch precisely in the vertices of two inequivalent dirac cones and any electronic excitations appearing in the conduction band will have the dispersion relation of a relativistic massless particle and their properties , accordingly , will be determined by the dirac equation . in the half - filling regime , with a completely filled valence band , we will have just a fermi point at the vertex , whereas in the presence of doping , a fermi surface builds up .    for many technological applications",
    ", it would be interesting if graphene were a semiconductor , instead of a semimetal .",
    "therefore , the possibility of an insulator state or the appearance of an excitonic gap due to short range electronic interactions in a system of massless dirac fermions on the honeycomb lattice has been the object of intense investigation  @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , early proposals that electron - electron interactions could generate an electronic gap were investigated even before the discovery of graphene  @xcite , where the gap opening is an analogue of the `` chiral symmetry '' breaking process that occurs in massless quantum electrodynamics ( qed ) in two dimensions  @xcite .",
    "this is the type of excitonic instability that we consider in the present paper .",
    "the fact that some of the above materials become superconductors upon doping provides a vast phenomenological motivation for the investigation of the superconducting phase diagram of dirac electrons systems .",
    "therefore , we analyse the effect of cooper pair formation in such systems , paying special attention to the cases where doping is present , in which case we must introduce a finite chemical potential .    indeed",
    ", we consider a quasi - two dimensional model consisting of dirac electrons both with superconducting and excitonic interactions .",
    "in particular , we study the competition between these two interactions and the resulting different situations that arise as we independently vary the coupling parameter of each interaction term and as we add charge carriers to the system .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sections [ model ] and [ t0 ] we obtain the continuum limit of our model and we calculate the free - energy ( effective potential ) at zero temperature . in section [ mu=0 ]",
    "we analyze the phase diagram of the model in the absence of doping or impurities . in section [ muneq0 ]",
    "the effect of doping is described by the introduction of a non - vanishing chemical potential and the physical effects of the interplay between the amount of doping and the interactions strength bring interesting consequences , which we fully analyze . each interaction is firstly taken independently and its respective phase diagram is obtained . at the end of section [ muneq0 ]",
    "we combine our results and we investigate the possibility of coexistence between cooper pairs and excitons .",
