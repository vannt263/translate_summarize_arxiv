    "the suspension thermal noise was calculated assuming the structural damping mechanism .",
    "however , the nature of dissipation in fused silica ( e.g. viscous vs structural ) is not yet fully established for the above frequency bands . ] in the laser interferometer gravitational wave observatory ( ligo )  .",
    "the thermal noise in this frequency band is caused by the losses in the suspension fibers , in particular at the top and the bottom of each fiber s attachment point .",
    "so far the only known way to reduce the thermal noise has been to improve the quality of the suspension fibers and their attachments .",
    "here we suggest a different approach :    in section ii we will present a general analysis of the suspension noise based on a direct application of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem .",
    "we will explicitly separate the contributions to the thermal noise of the top and the bottom attachment points of the suspension fibers .",
    "it has been a common opinion that the top and bottom attachments contribute equally to the thermal noise .",
    "we shall challenge this point of view .",
    "in fact , we will show that if one shifts the laser beam spot down from the center of the mirror by an appropriately chosen distance @xmath11 , the contribution of the bottom attachment point to the thermal noise can be reduced by several orders of magnitude .",

    "however , if one uses an advanced optical topology  for example , resonant sideband extraction  then it is possible to reduce the shot noise in a narrow band around any chosen frequency .",
    "then the thermal noise may dominate in this narrow band , and our observation ( [ eq : fn ] ) may be useful in case one tries to reduce the thermal noise by cooling of the fiber top .",
    "in this section we propose a recipe for how to decrease the influence of the thermally fluctuating stress at the top part of the suspension fiber .",
    "the basic idea is the following :    intuitively , the fluctuations at the top cause bending of the fiber at the top , which will be a random process in time .",
    "this random bending will randomly move the rest of the fiber and ultimately drive the random motion of the test mass .",
    "we propose to measure directly the thermally driven fluctuations in the horizontal displacement of the fiber , and from them infer the fluctuating force which drives the random motion of the mirror",
    ". we can then subtract the motion due to this fluctuating force from the interferometer output .",
    "formally this amounts to introducing a new readout variable @xmath105 as follows : @xmath106    here @xmath107 is the horizontal displacement of the laser spot s center ( i.e.the signal ultimately read by the interferometer s photodiode ) , and @xmath108 is the fiber s horizontal displacement weighted by some function @xmath109 to be discussed below .",
    "we will postpone the discussion of how to measure @xmath105 experimentally until the next section ; here we concentrate on finding the optimal @xmath109 and seeing what is the maximal possible reduction in the thermal noise .    to find the spectral density of fluctuations in @xmath105 we need to imagine acting on the system with sinusoidal force @xmath110 that appears in the interaction hamiltonian in the following way @xmath111 cf .",
    "the discussion of the fluctuation - dissipation theorem in ref .",
    "@xcite . from the eq .",
    "( [ eq : fq ] ) we observe that applying the generalized force @xmath112 to the system is equivalent to applying two forces simultaneously : one is a force of magnitude @xmath112 applied to the mirror surface at the center of the beam spot , and the other is a force distributed along the fiber in the following manner : @xmath113 the resulting motion of the system is shown in fig .",
    "4 . the intuitive idea is to choose the weighting function @xmath109 so that when the beam spot s height @xmath11 has also been appropriately chosen , @xmath112 induces no bending of the fiber at the top or at the bottom .    in the case of structural damping",
    "the dissipated power is proportional to the elastic energy @xmath114 of the fiber .",
    "thus formally one has to choose @xmath109 and @xmath11 so that @xmath114 is minimized .",
    "it is convenient to reformulate the problem : to find the shape of the fiber @xmath53 and beam - spot height @xmath11 for which the functional in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elasten ] ) has a minimum , and after this calculate the distribution @xmath109 of the driving force on the fiber that will produce the desired shape @xmath53 . in appendix",
    "b we carry out this straightforward but somewhat tedious task .",
    "we obtain [ cf .",
    "( [ eq : b3 ] ) ] @xmath115 here @xmath116 , @xmath20 is the radius of the mirror , @xmath18 is the length of the fiber , @xmath60 is the angular frequency of detection .",
    "we substitute here and below @xmath117 corresponding to the initial and enhanced ligo test masses .",
    "the profile of the distributed force acting on the fiber and hence of @xmath109 is mainly determined by @xmath118 ( see appendix b ) : @xmath119 which gives [ cf . eq .",
    "( [ eq : blast ] ) ] @xmath120 where @xmath84 . when the force distribution has this optimal form , the elastic energy has the minimum value @xmath121 where @xmath122 is the elastic energy in eq .",
    "( [ eq : elasten1 ] ) .",
    "therefore , for a fused silica fiber with @xmath123 and @xmath30 , we get @xmath124 and the maximal reduction factor for the spectral density of suspension thermal noise is @xmath125        before describing a particular experimental realization of the above scheme , a few general remarks are in order .",
    "first , one might worry that our averaging function @xmath109 is frequency dependent  in general , that could make the experimental implementation very difficult . in particular [ see appendix b , eq.([phi01 ] ) ] , @xmath126 consists of two components : @xmath127 , where @xmath128 and @xmath129 as given by eq .",
    "( [ phi01 ] ) have very different frequency dependence .",
    "however at the frequencies of interest @xmath130 , and then the approximate formula ( [ eq : phiopt ] ) for the averaging function @xmath131 is a product of two terms : one which depends only on the frequency @xmath36 ( i.e. @xmath132 ) , and the other which depends only on the coordinate @xmath133 .",
    "this feature makes the scheme feasible for a broad range of frequencies .",
    "it is sufficient that our device measures the displacement of the fiber with the frequency - independent averaging function @xmath134 , and that the frequency dependence is then put back in during data analysis when constructing the readout variable @xmath105 : @xmath135 where @xmath136 is chosen so that @xmath137 .    as mentioned above , eq .",
    "( [ eq : phiopt ] ) is an approximation valid when the fiber has no inertia , i.e. when @xmath138 .",
    "when the inertia of the fiber becomes important ( @xmath139 ) , it is no longer possible to factor out a frequency - dependent part of @xmath126 . as a result , when @xmath36 gets closer to @xmath140 , the effectiveness of the thermal noise suppression ( i.e. the value of @xmath141 ) is reduced .",
    "a detailed analysis shows that if we choose @xmath142 so that the thermal noise compensation is optimal ( @xmath143 ) at low frequencies @xmath144 , then at @xmath145 we have @xmath146 , at @xmath147 we have @xmath148 , and beyond this @xmath141 is reduced sharply as we approach the first violin mode . for the fused silica fiber discussed above @xmath149 ,",
    "so the compensation is effective throughout the band @xmath9hz where suspension thermal noise dominates .",
    "it is worth emphasizing that this deterioration in the reduction factor only happens when we use the averaging function @xmath128 instead of @xmath150 close to the violin frequency .",
    "thus , this limitation is one of technology and not of principle .",
    "perhaps , it is possible to conceive of a scheme where the correct averaging function is implemented at all frequencies .",
    "however , we have not been able to do so .",
    "secondly , any sensor used for monitoring the fiber coordinate @xmath151 will have an intrinsic noise which will deteriorate the quality of the thermal - noise compensation .",
    "in particular , the overall reduction factor @xmath152 is given by @xmath153 where @xmath154 is the spectral density of intrinsic noise of the device which measures the average displacement of the fiber and @xmath155 is the spectral density of thermal fluctuations of the same displacement .",
    "for the case of structural damping it is easy to estimate @xmath156 where we assume that @xmath157 for fused silica .",
    "if our goal is to achieve @xmath158 then the condition @xmath159 implies @xmath160 we shall take the above number as a sensitivity goal that our measuring device should achieve .",
    "now we are ready to describe a possible practical implementation of our thermal - noise compensation scheme .",
    "figure 5 illustrates the basic idea . we propose to use a fused silica optical fiber with the refractive index @xmath161 for the test mass s suspension .",
    "next to this fiber we attach to the top seismic isolation plate ( i.e. the  ceiling \" ) a rigid block of the fused silica @xmath162 with the same index of refraction @xmath161 .",
    "on the surface of this rigid block we put a thin optical waveguide with refractive index @xmath163 such that @xmath164 , so that the waveguide is at a distance @xmath165 from the suspension fiber .",
    "it is assumed that the side of the waveguide close to the suspension fiber does not have any coating , i.e. it is  naked \" .",
    "in this configuration the optical wave may propagate through the waveguide without substantial scattering even though the suspension fiber is within the wave s evanescent zone .",
    "this device will produce a relatively large response to the displacement @xmath166 in the form of a phaseshift of @xmath167 of the optical wave : @xmath168 where the dimensionless factor @xmath169 depends on the values of @xmath161 and @xmath163 and for typical optical waveguides is @xmath170 .",
    "equation ( [ eq : pshift ] ) implies that in order to register @xmath171 we need a sensitivity @xmath172 .",
    "thus for averaging time of @xmath173sec we need to use the power of coherent light of @xmath174 .",
    "this power can be decreased if one uses a resonant standing wave in the waveguide .",
    "apart from the shot noise of the laser light , let us briefly discuss two other kinds of noise in this sensor .",
    "a more complete discussion will be presented elsewhere .",
    "the first kind is seismic noise .",
    "a simple calculation shows that the seismic contribution to the noise in the readout variable @xmath105 is about twice as large in spectral density as the seismic contribution to the noise in @xmath107 .",
    "thus the seismic noise will not be an issue at frequencies above the `` seismic wall '' of the ligo sensitivity curve .",
    "the second kind of noise we want to mention is the mechanical thermal fluctuations of the waveguide itself .",
    "our estimates show that if these fluctuations are caused by structural damping ( and not by some surface or contact defects ) , then the ratio of the mechanical thermal fluctuations of the waveguide to those of the fiber is @xmath175 thus , if the system is sufficiently clean then the mechanical thermal fluctuations of the waveguide will probably not significantly reduce the sensitivity of our sensor .",
    "it is worth noting that in order to achieve the optimal compensation of thermal noise , the distance @xmath176 between the suspension fiber and the waveguide has to vary in accord with the optimal profile of the averaging function : @xmath177,\\ ] ] where @xmath162 and @xmath178 are constants to be discussed elsewhere . in this case",
    "the phase of the waveguide s output records the optimally averaged coordinate @xmath166 of the fiber .",
    "the profile @xmath176 may be difficult for experimental realization .",
    "however we find that in the simplest case when @xmath109 is a constant over the length @xmath18 of averaging , the factor @xmath141 is reduced very little : from @xmath179 to @xmath180 .",
    "in this paper we have done two things .",
    "firstly , we have shown that by an appropriate positioning of the laser s beam spot on the surface of each test - mass mirror , one can reduce the contribution of the suspension fiber s bottom to the suspension thermal noise by two to three orders of magnitude in the frequency band of @xmath1 for the initial ligo design .",
    "secondly , we have proposed a way to compensate the suspension thermal noise originating from the top of each fiber by monitoring independently the fiber s random horizontal displacement . in the best case , with the system parameters for the initial or enhanced ligo design",
    ", one can get a reduction factor of the order of @xmath181 in spectral density over the entire @xmath9hz band , when both the first and second procedures are applied ; and with realistic defects in the design one should be able to get a reduction of at least @xmath182    the device that compensates the suspension thermal noise can ease the requirements to quality of suspension system . in particular , if this device allows the reduction factor of @xmath183 , this would effectively increase the quality factors of pendulum and violin modes by a factor of @xmath183 .",
    "so far the highest quality factor @xmath184 of the pendulum mode was achieved in @xcite for a fused silica suspension fiber , which allows one to reach the standard quantum limit for averaging time of @xmath185sec .",
    "implementation of our proposal could effectively increase this quality factor to @xmath186 , which would reduce the thermal noise in ligo to the level of standard quantum limit for averaging time of @xmath187sec .",
    "then the techniques which allow one to beat the standard quantum limit ( see e.g. @xcite ) could be used in the enhanced ligo interferometers .",
