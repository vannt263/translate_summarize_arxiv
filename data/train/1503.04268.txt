    "viii ) , it follows that @xmath400 for the second part where @xmath401 or @xmath402 , we first see that @xmath403_{\\rho=1/2}^{\\rho=2 }      -\\int \\frac{1}{i(\\pm r+at\\rho^{a-1})}e^{\\pm ir\\rho+it\\rho^a}\\phi'(\\rho)d\\rho      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by the integration by parts . here",
    "we note that @xmath404 when @xmath401 or @xmath402 . from this and the support of @xmath405 ,",
    "we now get @xmath406 as desired .",
    "it remains to bound @xmath411 and @xmath412 .",
    "we shall consider only for @xmath411 because the same argument used for @xmath411 works clearly for @xmath412 .",
    "since the factor @xmath386 in @xmath413 would give a better boundedness than @xmath389 , we only need to show the desired bound for @xmath414 applying lemma [ vancor+intpart ] with @xmath415 and @xmath416 , we get @xmath417 also , by and in lemma [ bessel ] , we see that @xmath418 for @xmath419 . hence , @xmath420 thus , we get @xmath421 as desired .",
    "* the case where @xmath366 or @xmath143 .",
    "* in this case , we will use the following known fact ( see @xcite , p. 426 ) : for @xmath422 and @xmath369 , @xmath423 indeed , using this , we easily see that @xmath424 as desired .",
    "now we only need to consider the case where @xmath143 and @xmath425 since the other case where @xmath366 and @xmath129 follows clearly from the same argument .",
    "now we have to show that for @xmath425 @xmath426 where @xmath427 recall from that @xmath428 by and , the part of @xmath429 coming from @xmath430 in @xmath431 is bounded as follows : @xmath432 now we may consider only the part of @xmath429 coming from @xmath433 , because the factor @xmath386 in @xmath431 would give a better boundedness than @xmath389 .",
    "namely , we have to show the bound for @xmath434 applying lemma [ vancor+intpart ] with @xmath415 and @xmath435 , we then get @xmath436 from , it is also easy to see that @xmath437 hence it follows that @xmath438 as desired .      by hlder s inequality , we first see that @xmath439 and so we only need to show that for @xmath236 @xmath440 for this , we consider the operators @xmath441 , @xmath246 , defined by @xmath442 then the adjoint operator @xmath443 of @xmath444 is given by @xmath445 and so @xmath446 then , by regarding @xmath447 and @xmath345 as @xmath448 and @xmath449 , respectively , in , we are reduced to showing that for @xmath236 @xmath450 where @xmath451 .    to show this , by changing variables @xmath452 , we first see that @xmath453 and so we get @xmath454 using plancherel s theorem in @xmath41 . on the other hand , by",
    "we see that @xmath455 for @xmath246 .",
    "hence it follows that for @xmath246 @xmath456 and by the usual @xmath457 argument , we now get @xmath458 for @xmath459 , as desired .",
    "let us now show the inhomogeneous part in proposition [ prop_par ] .",
    "for this we show a stronger estimate @xmath460 which implies .",
    "indeed , to deduce from this , first decompose the @xmath461 norm in the left - hand side of into two parts , @xmath462 and @xmath463 .",
    "then the latter can be reduced to the former by a change of variables @xmath464 , and so we only need to consider the first part @xmath462 .",
    "but , since @xmath465 , by applying with @xmath21 replaced by @xmath466 , the first part follows directly , as desired .    to show , by duality we may show the following bilinear form estimate as before : @xmath467 but , once we have lemma [ local_prop ] replacing @xmath468 with @xmath469 , this estimate follows clearly by repeating the previous argument used for the homogeneous part . since is obviously valid for this replacement , it does not affect the last two estimates in the lemma .",
    "we only need to modify the first estimate as @xmath470 uniformly in @xmath471 .",
    "this is because the @xmath457 argument used for is no longer available in the case of @xmath469 . since @xmath472 is arbitrary and may be sufficiently small , it is not difficult to see that this modification is harmless in repeating the previous argument",
    ".    now we show the above modified estimate .",
    "similarly as in , we may write @xmath473 as in , we easily see that for a sufficiently large number @xmath319 , @xmath474 where @xmath333 and @xmath475 stands for @xmath282 or @xmath283 . here",
    "we also used hlder s inequality for the second inequality .",
    "next , using the cauchy - schwarz inequality together with the following trivial estimates @xmath476 we bound @xmath477 combining this and , we conclude that @xmath478 for a sufficiently large number @xmath319 .",
    "hence it suffices to show that @xmath479 where @xmath285 . for this",

    "now , by real interpolation between and , with @xmath483 and @xmath484 instead of @xmath269 and @xmath270 , respectively , we get after some easy computations .    using the dual characterisation of @xmath485 spaces and hlder s inequality",
