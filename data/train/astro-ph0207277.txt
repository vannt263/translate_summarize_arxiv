    "@xcite found an anticorrelation between the high- and low - energy x - ray emissions in ; this anticorrelation has been observed to extend up to 100 kev ( @xcite ) .",

    "these oscillations are thought to originate from matter in keplerian orbit close to the central object . if this so , these quasi - periodic oscillations carry information about the strong gravitational field in the vicinity of the compact object .    the energy spectrum of can be approximated by a combination of a power law ( sometimes with an exponentially cut - off at high energies ) , and a soft component , both affected by interstellar absorption .",
    "the soft component fits a blackbody , and is interpreted as the combined effect of emission from the surface of the neutron star and the accretion disc .",
    "the power law component is assumed to originate via comptonization of soft photons by hot electrons in a corona around the neutron star .    in",
    ", observations with einstein s solid state spectrometer have revealed emission features at @xmath4 kev ( @xcite ; ) ; these features are thought to originate in a corona around the neutron star or above the disc ( @xcite ) .",

    "we discuss spectral ( both continuum and line features ) and timing properties of the source .",
    "xmm - newton observed on march 13 2001 in two occasions , starting at 10:38 utc and at 12:38 utc , respectively ; the exposure times were @xmath5 ks , and @xmath6 ks , respectively . during the first observation data were collected with the _ reflection grating spectrometers ( rgs ) _ only , whereas during the second observation the _",
    "european photon imaging camera ( epic ) _ was also used .",
    "we will not discuss here the _ optical monitor _ data , and from the epic data , here we will only present results obtained with the mos cameras .    in the observation in which the epic cameras were used",
    ", mos 1 was operated in `` full frame '' ( imaging ) mode , in which data from all 7 ccds are read out with a time resolution of 2.6 seconds , whereas mos 2 was operated in `` timing mode '' ; in this mode data from the central ccd are collapsed into a one - dimensional row to achieve a 1.5-millisecond time resolution .",
    "both rgs cameras were operated in the standard `` spectral mode '' ( read out of all 9 ccds with a cycle of 5.7 seconds ) .",
    "the raw data was processed using the standard sas pipe - line . for our analysis we used the latest sas version ,",

    "we show the mos 1 image , from 0.3 to 12 kev .",
    "the source is relatively bright , and pile - up effects are apparent in the central parts of the image .    in figure [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig2 ] we show the 0.312 kev light extracted from mos 2 ( timing ) data . because of the much faster read - out time , pile - up is not a problem here .",
    "each point represents 64 seconds of data .",
    "there is a slight decrease of the source intensity as the observation progresses ; the x - ray hardness ( defined as the count rate ratio between the 0.34 kev band and the 412 kev band ) is consistent with being constant during the whole observation ( figure [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig1 ] ) .",

    "we used mos 1 data to produce a spectrum of the source in the range 0.3 to 12 kev . to reduce the effects of pile - up , we extracted data from an annulus that does not include the center of the image ( see figure [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig1 ] ) ; we also produced the corresponding rmf and arf files .",
    "we fitted the spectrum with different models , but we found that for energies above @xmath35 kev , a simple power law ( affected by interstellar absorption ) fits the data quite well .",
    "however , for @xmath36 kev there is an excess of emission above the power law .",
    "although the addition of a soft component ( we used blackbody or disc - blackbody emission ) improves the fit , the soft component can not fit completely the low - energy excess .",
    "a better fit ( reduced @xmath37 for 962 d.o.f . ) is obtained by fitting the data to a power law plus a gaussian line centered at 0.65 kev ( in this case the soft component is not needed , statistically speaking ) , with an equivalent width of about 200 - 300 ev . in figure",
    "[ mmendez - c1_fig : fig3 ] we show the mos spectrum for which we have left the excess at 0.65 kev unfitted ; the excess is apparent in the residuals plot .",
    "the best - fit parameters are shown in table 1 .",
    "figures [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig4]a and [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig4]b show the spectra extracted from both rgs cameras , fitted with the same model used to fit the mos data . to compare the fits between rgs and mos ,",
    "we left all model parameters free ; in this way , differences in the calibration between the three instruments become apparent as differences in the best - fit parameters in each spectrum .",
    "as already mentioned , the mos and rgs observations are not simultaneous , so small changes in the source spectrum may also be responsible , at least in part , for any difference in the best - fit parameters . given this caveat , the parameters that we obtained from the different instruments are in most cases very similar to each other .",
    "in particular , the excess emission above the power law fit in the mos data is also present in the rgs data ; the models fitted to the data in figures [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig4]a and [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig4]b _ do _ include this feature , and therefore the excess is not apparent in the residuals . in all cases ( mos and rgs ) , the feature is significantly detected ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that , if it really is an emission line or an emission - line complex , this feature is not resolved in the rgs spectrum .",
    "recently , have proposed that this low - energy excess in , and similar ones in three other low - mass x - ray binaries , may be attributed to an overabundance of , and an underabundance of in the absorbing material along the line of sight .",
    "such an unusual abundance of and in has already been reported by @xcite , based on letgs chandra data .",
    "juett et al .",
    "proposed that this / overabundance with respect to solar , could be local to these objects , and could be related to the evolution history of the secondary star in the system .",
    "we therefore fitted the mos and rgs data with a model consisting of a power law plus a blackbody , both affected by interstellar absorption , for which the relative abundances of and were left as free parameters .",
    "in this case , we did not include the emission line - like feature .",
    "the fits are good , with reduce @xmath39 for @xmath40 d.o.f . , and / and / abundances that are @xmath41 , and @xmath42 solar , respectively .",
    "besides the 0.65 kev excess , the rgs spectra show other features , that are consistent with those already seen in this source with chandra plus the low - energy transmission grating spectrometer ( @xcite ) ; most noticeable are the k edge at @xmath4314  ( rgs 2 ) , the k edge at @xmath44  ( rgs 1 ) , and the 1s2p atomic absorption feature at @xmath45(rgs 1 ) .",
    "we used mos 2 `` timing '' mode data to produce a power spectrum for observation 2 .",
    "we calculated the fourier transform of contiguous 256 seconds long segments , up to a nyquist frequency of 256 hz without energy selection .",
    "the individual power spectra were then averaged to produce a single power spectrum of the whole observation .",
    "this power spectrum is shown in figure [ mmendez - c1_fig : fig5 ] , where we have subtracted the contribution of poisson noise .",
    "the power spectrum is more or less flat up to @xmath35 hz , and there it gradually steepens towards higher frequencies , which is typical of neutron star and black hole x - ray binaries in the so - called low ( hard ) state . in the case of low - luminosity neutron star binaries , like",
    "( these binaries are also known as atoll sources ) , this state is called `` island '' ( the names derive from the shape traced out by these sources in a color - color diagram ; see @xcite )    to estimate the variability of the source during our observation , we fitted the power spectrum with a function consisting of two lorentzians .",
    "the central frequencies of these two lorentzians are @xmath46 hz , and @xmath47 hz , respectively , and the fwhm are @xmath48 hz , and @xmath49 hz , respectively .",
    "the total rms variability ( integrated from 0 to @xmath50 ) is @xmath51% .",
    "this value is consistent with those in other atoll sources , and in particular in , in the island state ( see .",
    "e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our xmm - newton observations of the low - mass x - ray binary found the source in the so - called island state , during which the energy spectrum fits a relatively flat power law ( photon index @xmath52 ) , and the power spectrum shows a broad - band component that extends up to @xmath35 hz , with high rms variability ( @xmath53% in this case ) .",
    "striking from the spectral fits is the excess emission ( above the power law emission ) at @xmath54 kev that is apparent both in the mos and rgs spectra .",
    "a similar excess has been reported by @xcite using the solid state spectrometer aboard einstein , and @xcite using the solid state imaging spectrometers aboard asca .",
    "the low - energy excess reported by @xcite is centered at around 0.77 kev , and has an equivalent width of @xmath55 ev . in our case",
    "the excess is centered at a slightly lower energy ( @xmath54 kev ) , and we measure a larger equivalent width ( 200300 ev ) .",
    "christian et al .",
    "propose that this excess could be due to emission by ly@xmath56 and he - like , and  in a corona around the central object .",
    "similar emission has been detected recently from other x - ray binaries , e.g. exo074867 ( @xcite ) and ( @xcite ) . in those cases , however , the emission lines are narrow .",
    "it is possible that the excess that we measure is due to oxygen radiative recombination continuum produced by transitions of continuum electrons to the ground state ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "alternatively , it is possible that this line - like `` feature '' is a consequence of assuming that the abundance of the absorbing material along the line of sight is solar .",
    "in fact , the feature disappears when an overabundance of / in the absorbing material with respect to the solar abundance is considered .",
    "if , as suggested by , this overabundance occurs in the vicinity of the binary system , these results are relevant within the evolutionary scenario of this , and similar x - ray binaries ."
