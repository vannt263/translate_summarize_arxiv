    "the modelling and interpretation of the iso - sws ( infrared space observatory - short wavelength spectrometer ) data require an accurate calibration of the spectrometers ( schaeidt et al .",
    "1996 ) . in the sws spectral region",
    "( 2.38  45.2 @xmath19 m ) the primary standard calibration candles are bright , mostly cool , stars .",
    "the better the behaviour of these calibration sources in the infrared is known , the more accurate the spectrometers can be calibrated .",
    "iso offered the first opportunity to obtain continuous mid - infrared spectra between 2.38 and 45.2 @xmath19 m  at a spectral resolving power of @xmath20 , not polluted by any molecular absorptions of the earth s atmosphere .",
    "therefore our knowledge on the mid - infrared behaviour of the stellar calibration sources is limited .",
    "refining the synthetic reference spectra used to calibrate the sws can only be done by refining the model atmospheres of the stars .",
    "a full exploitation of the iso data can therefore only result from an iterative process in which both accurate observations and new modelling are involved . in order to obtain a reliable convergence in such an iterative process",
    ", one needs : ( 1 ) a sample of bright stellar objects spread over a large range in spectral type ; ( 2 ) a thorough understanding of cool star atmospheres and of the influence of the various parameters  e.g.  t@xmath1 , @xmath3 g , and chemical composition  on the emergent spectra . with this in mind",
    ", stars with spectral types ranging from a0  m8 were observed with iso - sws .",
    "it is important to cover a broad parameter space in order to distinguish calibration problems from problems related to the model and/or in the generation of the synthetic spectrum .",
    "concerning point 2 above , it is necessary to perform an intensive study of the influence of different stellar parameters on synthetic spectra .",
    "the results of such a study will be presented with the red giant @xmath0 tau as a test case .",
    "the results for 15 other stars in our sample will be presented in forthcoming papers .",
    "this research has been done within the framework of the proposal starmod ( title : accurate modelling of cool - star atmospheres ; p.i . : c. waelkens ; c.i .",

    "some calibration data have been provided by the sws instrument dedicated team ( sidt ) in the framework of a quick - feedback refining of the model spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of the calibration sources used for the sws calibration .",
    "so far , the analysis of the discrepancies between the iso - sws data and the corresponding synthetic spectra has been restricted to the wavelength region from 2.38 to 12 @xmath19 m , since the lack of comprehensive molecular and atomic line lists hamper fast progress at longer wavelengths ( 12  45 @xmath19 m ) .",
    "furthermore the brightness of the stars drops quickly in this wavelength region so that the same signal to noise ratio will not be achieved .",
    "a third point is that the seds may also be affected by unknown circumstellar contribution .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in sect .",
    "2 the observations are described and the data reduction procedures are discussed . in sect .",
    "3 a summary of the literature concerning @xmath0 tau is presented , on the basis of which the starting values for our modelling stellar parameters are selected .",
    "the effect of changing stellar parameters on the synthetic spectra of k and m giants is analyzed in sect .",
    "4 . in sect .",
    "5 the method of analysis is outlined , while in sect .",
    "6 the results are discussed . in the last section ,",
    "7 , the main conclusions are summarized .",
    "a full scan observation of @xmath0 tau has been obtained in the 2.38  45.2 @xmath19 m  wavelength range with the short - wavelength spectrometer ( sws ) ( de graauw et al .",
    "1996 ) on board iso .",
    "this has been done by use of the sws observing mode aot01 (= a single up - down scan for each aperture / order combination ) with scanner speed 4 , resulting in a resolving power of @xmath21 1500 . the observation lasted for 6650 s and was performed during revolution 636 .",
    "the data were processed to a calibrated spectrum sampled in all the pixels , the so - called auto - analysis product , using the procedures and calibration files of the iso off - line pipeline version 7.0 . for a description of the flux and wavelength calibration ,",
    "we refer to schaeidt et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and valentijn et al .",
    "this reduction resulted in an oversampled spectrum for each of the four aot - bands , which each consist of 12 detectors .",
    "remaining instrumental effects , such as fringes in the 12.0  29.5 @xmath19 m  part of the spectrum , were removed using the sws interactive analysis package ( ia ) provided by the sidt .",
    "the band-2 data ( 4.08  12 @xmath19 m ) are severely affected by detector memory effects .",
    "time and flux dependent memory effects occur for all four instruments ( sws , lws , phot , cam ) on board iso .",
    "so far , several attempts have been made to model the corrections of the transient effects ( see e.g.van malderen et al .",
    "1999 ) , but currently no foolproof method exists to correct the sws data for these transient effects .",
    "memory effects appear to be less severe in the down - scan measurements , which are obtained after the up - scan data , suggesting a more stabilized response to the flux level for down - scan data .",
    "the sws flux calibration of band 2 was corrected for a regime where the flux history of the detectors is comparable to the second scan in the observation , the so - called down scan .",
    "we therefore used the down - scan data of our observation as a reference to do a correction of the flux level of the first scan .",
    "several procedures were performed on each sub - band separately to combine the twelve detectors . a sigma - clipping procedure ( with @xmath22 ) was used to reduce the noise by discarding the datapoints in every resolution element for which the difference to the mean was @xmath23 . after aligning the twelve different detector signals to their average level and rebinning to the expected resolution ( see table [ resolution ] ) , the final result was obtained .",
    "although the resolution changes in within one sub - band , the resolution was kept constant ( see table [ resolution ] ) and the value was taken to be the lowest value in fig .  6 by lorente ( 1998 ) .",
    "the individual sub - band spectra , when combined into a single spectrum , can show jumps in flux levels at the band edges .",
    "this is due to imperfect flux calibration or wrong dark - current subtraction for low - flux observations . using the overlap regions of the different sub - bands and looking at other sws observations ,",
    "several sub - bands were multiplied by a small factor ( see table [ resolution ] ) to construct a smooth spectrum . due to the problems with memory effects in band 2 ,",
    "the factor of band 2b was determined by use of the template of cohen et al .",
    "( 1992 ) and the obtained synthetic spectra .",

    "this can also be seen in the equations for @xmath119 ( see appendix b ) for the extreme case in which all carbon is present in the form of co with t@xmath143 k. the strong metallicity dependence of h@xmath117o in the approximate relation for @xmath119 may be well visible , though this increase ( with decreasing z ) is small for weak h@xmath117o bands .",
    "the impact of changing the microturbulent velocity is most important for the co lines with a large equivalent width .",
    "when a line is saturated , increasing @xmath8  widens the wavelength range covered by the absorption and reduces the saturation , thus increasing the total absorption . in the line center of an unsaturated line , a smaller microturbulence corresponds to a higher absorption coefficient at that frequency ( see fig .",
    "[ overall ] ) .    decreasing the microturbulent velocity from 2 @xmath10  to 1 @xmath10diminishes the co first overtone absorption by maximum 10% and the co fundamental by up to 6% , the sio first overtone by up to 4% , and the sio fundamental by up to 3% , the fundamental band of oh by up to 3% and the ro - vibrational stretching modes ( @xmath144 and @xmath145 ) and bending mode ( @xmath146 ) of h@xmath117o by up to 0.5% .",
    "red giant atmospheres display altered c , n , and o abundances and isotopic ratios ( in particular @xmath11 ) , due to dredge - up episodes .",
    "suppose that the @xmath11  ratio is changed from 10 ( case i ) to 4.26 ( case ii ) . if a @xmath24co line is saturated in case i , its equivalent width will decrease very few from case i to case ii . if we assume the @xmath25co line to be very weak in case i , its equivalent width will increase very much from case i to case ii by a factor nearly equal to the new / old isotopic ratio .",
    "therefore it is understandable that a decrease in @xmath11  will consequently cause @xmath119(co ) to increase , although this increase may be very small if the co bands are weak ( fig .",
    "[ overall ] ) .      when the ratio c / o increases ( but remains @xmath147 1 ) , the structure of the atmosphere is affected through changes in line blanketing . more co will be formed and less oxygen will be left ( after co formation ) to form oxygen - based molecules . hence , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ overall ] , the total absorption of co will increase , while it will decrease for sio , oh and h@xmath117o .",
    "increasing the oxygen abundance gives roughly the reverse effect , but the total co absorption hardly changes .",

    "[ 0.5 ]    fig . [ startvalues ] reveals several discrepancies . as outlined in sect .",
    "1 , the origin of these discrepancies can be either a calibration problem or a problem related to the generation of the synthetic spectrum . precisely because this research involves both theoretical developments on the model spectra and calibration improvements of the spectral reduction method",
    ", one has to be extremely careful not to confuse technical detector problems with astrophysical issues .",
    "therefore , several points have to be taken into account when scrutinizing these discrepancies .",
    "first of all , one has to take into account that the calibration process is a delicate one . due to the high flux level of the observations ,",
    "dark - current subtraction does not influence the final spectrum much , but memory effects affect the reliability of band-2 observations .",
    "therefore , mainly the band-1 data were used for the determination of the stellar parameters .",
    "the final result is however very sensitive to the relative spectral response function ( rsrf ) used .",
    "the rsrf was intensively measured in the lab before launch by use of a cryogenic blackbody source with temperatures between 30 and 300k .",
    "after the launch of iso these intermediate rsrfs were corrected for broad - band residues detected by comparing reference spectral energy distributions ( seds )  synthetic spectra ( kurucz 1993 ; van der bliek et al .",
    "1998 ) and composites of m. cohen ( cohen et al . 1992 , 1996a ; witteborn et al . 1999 )  with sws observations processed with these intermediate rsrfs using stellar candles of different ir spectral signature . by using a cubic spline smoothing algorithm and sigmaclipping",
    "the risk was minimized of introducing false spectral features and one also avoids possible bias by spectral features of one type of source ( vandenbussche , 1999 ) .",
    "the absolute flux level is determined by use of photometric data and composite seds of various sources .",
    "the flux calibration accuracy is estimated to be 5  7% in band 1 , 7  12% in band 2a , 7  15% in band 2b and 11  25% in band 2c , the worst accuracy being located at the edges .",
    "the spectral cover from a0 ",
    "m7 was highly necessary , since the different structures of the various selected stars make it possible to decide upon the quality of the used rsrfs . to test our findings , high - resolution observations of two stars",
    "were also studied in detail . for a discussion about the quality of the rsrfs",
    ", we refer to the forthcoming papers which will describe the other 15 stars in our sample .    in order to elucidate problems with the theoretical atmospheric structure ,",
    "it is important to know the relative importance of the different molecules ( see fig .",
    "[ atdiv ] ) and the influence of the stellar parameters on the total absorption by these molecules ( see sect . [ param ] ) .",
    "[ atdiv ] shows clearly that especially the molecules co , oh and sio are helpful in determining the atmospheric parameters . in spite of the moderate resolution of iso - sws , we will demonstrate that one can pin down the stellar parameters of cool giants very accurately from these data .",
    "this is due to the large wavelength range of iso - sws , where different important molecules determine the spectral signature .",
    "since these different spectral features do each react in another way on a change of one of the several heterogeneous stellar parameters , it is possible to improve on the stellar parameters . using a metallicity of z @xmath148 yields , e.g. , a synthetic spectrum which has too low a flux density in the wavelength range from 2.6  2.8 @xmath19 m , with the line contrast @xmath142 being too strong .",
    "[ overall ] turned out to be extremely useful to ascertain the gravity : the inverse influence of the gravity on the oh lines compared to the co and sio lines , together with the steep slope in band 1b and band 1d make it possible to pin down the logarithm of the gravity within 0.15 dex ! because the microturbulent velocity @xmath8  does not only act on the co lines , but also on the strongest sio and oh lines , one may disentangle a wrong microturbulence and a wrong carbon abundance .    in order to achieve the highest possible agreement between the data and the different synthetic spectra , a statistical approach is proposed .",

    "this generalized result is written in the form of a planck function with a brightness temperature that is a function of both observing wavelength and effective temperature .",
    "this function is then fitted to the best empirical flux data available , providing thus the effective temperature and the angular diameter .",
    "blackwell & shallis ( 1977 ) have described the infrared flux method ( irfm ) to determine the stellar angular diameters and effective temperatures from absolute infrared photometry . for 28 stars ( including @xmath0 car , @xmath0 boo , @xmath0 cma , @xmath0 lyr , @xmath166 peg , @xmath0 cen a , @xmath0 tau and @xmath335 dra )",
    "the angular diameters are deduced . only for the first four stars the corresponding effective temperatures are computed .",
    "scargle & strecker ( 1979 ) have compared the observed infrared flux curves of cool stars with theoretical predictions in order to assess the model atmospheres and to derive useful stellar parameters .",
    "this comparison yielded the effective temperature ( determined from flux curve shape alone ) and the angular diameter ( determined from the magnitudes of the fluxes ) .",
    "the overall uncertainty in t@xmath1  is probably about 150 k , which translates into about a 9% error in the angular diameter .",
    "manduca et al .",
    "( 1981 ) have compared absolute flux measurements in the 2.5  5.5 @xmath19 m  region with fluxes computed for model stellar atmospheres .",
    "the stellar angular diameters obtained from fitting the fluxes at 3.5 @xmath19 m  are in good agreement with observational values and with angular diameters deduced from the relation between visual surface brightness and ( @xmath296 ) colour .",
    "the temperatures obtained from the shape of the flux curves are in satisfactory agreement with other temperature estimates .",
    "since the average error is expected to be well within 10% , the error for the angular diameter is estimated to be in the order of 5% .",
    "smith & lambert ( 1990 ) have determined the chemical composition of a sample of m , ms and s giants . the use of a slightly different set of lines for the molecular vibra - rotational lines , along with improved @xmath336-values for cn and nh , lead to a small difference in the carbon , nitrogen and oxygen abundance compared to smith & lambert ( 1985 ) .",
    "kjrgaard et al .  ( 1982 ) examined two cases for which they derived equations for the approximate absorption coefficient @xmath337 . in case ( a ) most of the carbon and nitrogen",
    "are still considered to be free atoms , assumed for t@xmath1  @xmath338 5000 k , while in case ( b ) almost all the c and n are in the form of co and n@xmath117 , assumed for t@xmath1  @xmath276 4500 k. looking at the relatively high partial pressure of cn , it seems that the assumption of complete association of n into n@xmath117 is not valid for our giant models . attributing all depletion to the formation of n@xmath117 seems to be more valid in a dwarf model ( bell & tripicco 1991 ) .",
    "the formula can however still give a qualitative view of the influence of the different parameters .",
    "for case ( b ) kjrgaard et al .",
    "deduced an approach for cn : @xmath339 using the approach of kjrgaard et al .",
    ", similar equations for co , sio , oh , h@xmath117o and nh are derived .    for co",
    ", we have @xmath340 in the assumption that all carbon is locked into co , + @xmath119(co ) may also be written as @xmath341 with the approximation of n(e ) and n(h)/n(e ) in the line - forming region being ( kjrgaard et al . , 1982 )",
    "@xmath342    the approximate absorption coefficient of sio is defined as @xmath343 for oxygen - rich giants , n(o  i ) may be approximated by @xmath344 the equilibrium of silicon is dominated by sio and si  i ( si  ii is present in the deeper layers as well ) .",
    "for example , in the model with t@xmath1= 4050 k , @xmath3 g = 1.00 , z = 0.00 , m = 1.5 m@xmath6 , @xmath8  = 2.0 @xmath10 , the proportion of the number densities are given in table [ tablesio ] .",
    "since the ratio @xmath345 changes rapidly in the outer layers of the photosphere , a rough approximation to @xmath346 , valid in the region where @xmath347 , is then + @xmath348 so that @xmath349                      the approximate absorption coefficient of nh is written as @xmath358 the equilibrium of the nitrogen species is dominated by the n@xmath117 formation .",
