    "by constraining the amount of classical information which can be reliably encoded into a collection of quantum states  @xcite , the holevo bound sets a limit on the rates that can be achieved when transferring classical messages in a quantum communication channel . even though , for finite number of channel uses , the bound in general is not achievable , it is saturated  @xcite in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many channel uses .",
    "consequently , via proper optimization and regularization  @xcite , it provides the quantum analog of the shannon capacity formula  @xcite , i.e. the _ classical capacity _ of the quantum channel ( e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite ) .    starting from the seminal works of ref .",
    "@xcite several alternative versions of the asymptotic attainability of the holevo bound have been presented so far ( e.g. see refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the original proof  @xcite was obtained extending to the quantum regime the typical subspace encoding argument of shannon communication theory  @xcite . in this context an explicit detection scheme ( sometime presented as the _ pretty good measurement _ ( pgm ) scheme  @xcite ) was introduced that allows for exact message recovery in the asymptotic limit infinitely long codewords .",
    "more recently , ogawa and nagaoka  @xcite , and hayashi and nagaoka  @xcite proved the asymptotic achievability of the bound by establishing a formal connection with quantum hypothesis testing problem  @xcite , and by generalizing a technique ( the information - spectrum method ) which was introduced by verd and han  @xcite in the context of classical communication channel .    in this paper",
    "we analyze a new decoding procedure for classical communication in a quantum channel . here",
    "we give a formal proof using conventional methods , whereas in @xcite we give a more intuitive take on the argument .",
    "our decoding procedure allows for a new proof of the asymptotic attainability of the holevo bound . as in refs .",
    "@xcite it is based on the notion of typical subspace but it replaces the pgm scheme with a sequential decoding strategy in which , similarly to the quantum hypothesis testing approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , the received quantum codeword undergoes to a sequence of simple yes / no projective measurements which try to determine which among all possible inputs my have originated it . to prove that this strategy attains the bound we compute its associated _ average _ error probability and show that it converges to zero in the asymptotic limit of long codewords ( the average being performed over the codewords of a given code _ and _ over all the possible codes ) .",
    "the main advantage of our scheme resides on the fact that , differently from pgm and its variants  @xcite , it allows for a simple intuitive description , it clarifies the role of entanglement in the decoding procedure @xcite , its analysis avoids some technicalities , and it appears to be more suited for practical implementations .    the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ int ] we set the problem and present the scheme in an informal , non technical way . the formal derivation of the procedure begins in the next section .",

    "the transmission of classical messages through a quantum channel can be decomposed in three logically distinct stages : the _ encoding _ stage in which the sender of the message ( say , alice ) maps the classical information she wish to communicate into the states of some quantum objects ( the quantum information carriers of the system ) ; the _ transmission _ stage in which the carriers propagate along the communication line reaching the receiver ( say , bob ) ; and the _ decoding _ stage in which bob performs some quantum measurement on the carriers in order to retrieve alice s messages . for explanatory purposes",
    "we will restrict the analysis to the simplest scenario where alice is bound to use only unentangled signals and where the noise in the channel is memorylessa similar formulation of the problem holds also when entangled signals are allowed : in this case however the @xmath1 defined in the text represents ( possibly entangled ) states of @xmath2-longs _ blocks _ of carriers : for each possible choice of @xmath2 , and for each possible coding / decoding strategy one define the error probability as in eq .",
    "( [ ff1prova ] ) . the optimal transmission rate ( i.e.  the capacity of the channel ) is also expressible as in the rhs term of eq .  ( [ capa ] ) via proper regularization over @xmath2 ( this is a consequence of the super - additivity of the holevo information  @xcite ) .",
    "finally the same construction can be applied also in the case of quantum communication channels with memory , e.g. see ref .",
    "@xcite . ] . under this hypothesis",
    "the coding stage can be described as a process in which alice encodes @xmath0 classical messages into factorized states of @xmath3 quantum carriers , producing a collection @xmath4 of @xmath0 quantum codewords of the form @xmath5 where @xmath6 are symbols extracted from a classical alphabet and where we use @xmath0 different vectors @xmath7 . due to the communication noise",
    ", these strings will be received as the factorized states @xmath8 ( the output codewords of the system ) , where for each @xmath9 we have @xmath10 @xmath11 being the completely positive , trace preserving channel  @xcite that defines the noise acting on each carrier .",
    "finally , the decoding stage of the process can be characterized by assigning a specific positive valued operator measurement ( povm )  @xcite which bob applies to @xmath12 to get a ( hopefully faithful ) estimation @xmath13 of the value @xmath14 . indicating with @xmath15 the elements which compose the selected povm , the average error probability that bob will mistake a given @xmath14 sent by alice for a different message ,",

    "@xcite the achievability of the bound  ( [ capa ] ) was obtained by showing that that from _ any _ output quantum ensemble @xmath23 it is possible to identify a set of @xmath26 output codewords @xmath12 , and a decoding povm for which the error probability of eq .",
    "( [ ff1prova ] ) goes to zero as @xmath3 increases .",
    "note that proceeding this way , one can forget about the initial mapping @xmath27 and work directly with the @xmath28 mapping .",
    "this is an important simplification which typically is not sufficiently stressed ( see however ref .",
    "@xcite ) . within this framework ,",
    "the proof @xcite exploited the random coding trick by shannon in which the povm is shown to provide exponential small error probability _ in average _ , when mediating over all possible groups of codewords associated with @xmath23 .",
    "the idea we present here follows the same typicality approach of refs .",
    "@xcite but assumes a different detection scheme . in particular , while in refs .",
    "@xcite the povm produces all possible outcomes in a single step as shown schematically in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] , our scheme is sequential .",
    "namely , bob performs a sequence of measurements to test for each of the codewords . specifically , he performs a first yes / no measure to verify whether or not the received signal corresponds to the first element of the list , see fig .",
    "if the answer is yes he stops and declares that the received message was the first one .",
    "if the answer is no he takes the state which emerges from the measurement apparatus and performs a new yes / no measure aimed to verify whether or not it corresponds to the second elements of the list , and so on until he has checked for all possible outcomes .",
    "the difficulty resides in the fact that , due to the quantum nature of the codewords , at each step of the protocol the received message is partially modified by the measurement ( a problem which will _ not _ occur in a purely classical communication scenario ) .",
    "this implies for instance that the state that is subject to the second measurement is not equal to what bob received from the quantum channel . as a consequence , to avoid that the accumulated errors diverge as the detection proceeds , the yes / no measurements needs to be carefully designed to have little impact on the received codewords .",
    "as will be clarified in the following section we tackle this problem by resorting on the notion of typical subspaces  @xcite : specifically our yes / no measurements will be mild modifications of von neumann projections on the typical subspaces of the codewords , in which their non exact orthogonality is smoothed away by rescaling them through further projection on the typical subspace of the source average message ( see sec .  [ sec2 ] for details ) .     of the codewords",
    "are represented by the open circles , while the projections on the typical subspace @xmath29 of the average message of the source are represented by the black circles .",
    "the inset describes the standard pgm decoding scheme which produces all the possible outcomes in a single step.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]",
    "in this section we review some basic notions and introduce the definitions necessary to formalize our detection scheme .",
    "an independent , identically distributed quantum source is defined by assigning the quantum ensemble @xmath30 which specifies the density matrices @xmath31 emitted by the source as they emerge from the memoryless channel , as well as the probabilities @xmath22 associated with those events ( here @xmath9 is the associated classical random variable which takes values on the domain @xmath32 ) .",
    "since the channel is memoryless , when operated @xmath3 consecutive times , it generates products states @xmath33 of the form @xmath34 with probability @xmath35 ( in these expressions @xmath36 ) . in strict analogy to shannon information theory , one defines a @xmath0-element code * c * as a collection of @xmath0 states of the form  ( [ eq1 ] ) , i.e. @xmath37 with @xmath4 being the subset of @xmath38 which identifies the elements of * c * ( i.e. the codewords of the code ) .",
    "the probability that the source will generate the code * c * can then be computed as the ( joint ) probability of emitting all the codewords that compose it , i.e. @xmath39      consider @xmath40 the _ average _ density matrix associated with the ensemble @xmath41 , and let @xmath42 its spectral decomposition ( i.e. @xmath43 are the orthonormal basis of @xmath44 formed by the eigenvectors of @xmath45 while @xmath46 are their eigenvalues ) . for fixed @xmath47 , one defines  @xcite the typical subspace @xmath29 of @xmath45 as the subspace of @xmath48 spanned by those vectors @xmath49 whose associated probabilities @xmath50 satisfy the constraint , @xmath51 where @xmath52 $ ] is the von neumann entropy of  @xmath45 ( as in the classical case  @xcite , the states @xmath53 defined above can be thought as those which , in average , contain the symbol @xmath54 almost @xmath55 times ) .",

    "it is also worth stressing that since the vectors @xmath86 in general are not orthogonal with respect to the label @xmath14 , there will be a certain overlap between the subspaces @xmath79 .",
