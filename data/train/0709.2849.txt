    ", a number of features and differences emerges for rydberg ions in a paul trap , which will be illuminated in the present work .",
    "first of all , the character of a rydberg ion as a composite object gives rise to an intrinsic coupling of electronic and external motion in the presence of the electric trapping fields .",
    "this will be shown to result in renormalized trapping frequencies for rydberg ions compared to their ground state counterparts .",
    "furthermore , the interaction among ions is not - as in the neutral case - governed by the dipole - dipole force alone but also by the charge - charge , dipole - charge and charge - quadrupole interaction .",
    "the interplay of this rich variety of interactions among the ions and the external trapping fields will be analyzed .    in our study",
    "we focus on ionic rydberg states with low angular momentum quantum number and correspondingly large quantum defect , and large fine structure splitting , as these states can be most simply described and most easily excited by laser light from electronic ground states . for typical ion trap parameters @xcite static dipolar and van - der - waals interaction among ions in these rydberg states is shown to be small compared to the energy scale set by the external trapping frequencies of the ions .",
    "thus , in order to establish substantially stronger interactions , we employ additional microwave ( mw ) fields driving transitions between rydberg states .",
    "this leads to large oscillating dipole moments , which result in remarkably strong controllable dipole - dipole interactions between the ions .",
    "our findings show that for strong interactions the internal and external dynamics of the ion chain approximately decouple such that a  frozen \" rydberg gas is formed . in this limit",
    "the hamiltonian describing the electronic dynamics can be formulated in an effective spin-1/2 representation and involves resonant and off - resonant dipole - dipole interaction terms with coupling strengths of the order of several hundred mhz .",
    "based on this effective spin model we demonstrate resonant excitation transfer on a nanosecond timescale from one end to the other of the ion chain .",
    "moreover , we show that a two - qubit conditional phase gate between adjacent ions , based on the dipole - dipole interaction , can be realized on a time scale , which is much shorter than both the external dynamics and the radiative lifetime of the involved rydberg states .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",

    "they possess a single valence electron with the remaining electrons forming closed shells @xcite .",
    "for the description of such system one can employ an effective two - body approach in which the ion is modeled by a two - fold positively charged core ( mass @xmath16 , position @xmath17 ) and the valence electron ( mass @xmath18 , position @xmath19 ) . the corresponding interaction ( model-)potential depends only on the relative coordinate @xmath20 and also on the angular momentum state of the atom .",
    "the latter dependence accounts for the quantum defect - a lowering in the energy for low angular momentum states in which the valence electron probes the inner electronic shells .",
    "high angular momentum states ( typically with angular momentum quantum number @xmath21 ) do not exhibit a significant quantum defect since here the valence electron is located far away from the ionic core thus experiencing a bare coulomb potential .",
    "we now formulate the hamiltonian of a single rydberg ion in the presence of the electric potential of the paul trap .",
    "we add a linear potential , corresponding to a time - dependent homogeneous electric field , @xmath22 , such that the combined electric potential reads @xmath23 .",
    "below , we will employ these additional mw fields to electronically couple different rydberg states .",
    "this will allow us to generate large oscillating dipole moments , which give rise to strong dipole - dipole interactions among dressed rydberg ions .",

    "the term @xmath50 contains all dependencies on the electronic coordinates describing the motion of an electron in the field of a doubly charged ionic core which is superimposed by the electric potential @xmath51 .",
    "the electronic dynamics takes place on a much faster time scale compared to the cm motion in the trap .",
    "the external electric field prevents , unlike in the field - free case , the separation of the cm and relative dynamics . the coupling between these motions",
