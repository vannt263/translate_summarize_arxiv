    "the question of _ imbalance _ or _",
    "asymmetry _ is long known in many popular and fundamental phenomena in non - equilibrium statistical physics such as gradient - induced transfer of particles , heat or current @xcite .",
    "the two - specie fermion mixtures and the impact of its population imbalance on the phase diagram of uniform superfluidity is also one of the multiple faces of the mentioned problem @xcite .",
    "this issue emerges in a quite natural way in other fields : for example in ecology , where the imbalance can be related to inclusion of the non - native species in certain area @xcite , as well as to the absolute number of species in the branches of phylogenetic tress @xcite or in general it can govern the whole evolution in a specific ecosystem @xcite . in economics",
    "the heterogeneity can be manifested for example by zipf s law in distribution of firm sizes @xcite or in the statistics of order books @xcite .",
    "apart from the above mentioned quantitative sciences , there is also sociology , during the last two decades under frequent consideration of physicists which eventually led to the emergence of novel scientific entity ",
    "sociophysics @xcite .",
    "its powerful tools have been widely used not only to face the problems of culture spreading @xcite , collective behavior of audience @xcite , correspondence activity @xcite or travel customs @xcite but very recently it also touches the issues of moral standards @xcite and emotions @xcite . by the same token",
    ", a significant attention is devoted to _ social balance_.",
    "its evolution on networks with both friendly and unfriendly relations has proven to provide signs of phase transitions @xcite or complex energy landscapes @xcite",
    ". the complexity is inseparably binded with human nature with respect to the _ social imbalance _ : it is true that people are inequality - aware which is backed even by neural evidence @xcite but then again they also tend to accept inequalities reflecting differences in individual achievements @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we draw attention to the issue of imbalance in a model of isolation of species ( communities ) extending the previously obtained results @xcite .",
    "social isolation is a crucial problem which can be caused by various factors such as illness , imprisonment or emigration and is regarded to have a substantial impact on higher suicide rates @xcite . in this context , isolation may also emerge as an effect of the social imbalance , just to mention large discrepancies between number of males and females in france after world war i @xcite . bearing that in mind , we shall try to show the impact that different methods of imbalance introduction may have on the number of isolated species .",
    "the paper s structure is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec : basic_model ] we describe in short the basic model of isolation , sec .",
    "[ sec : gen_desc ] gives details of the ways the imbalance is introduced and sec .",
    "[ sec : num ] presents exhaustive analysis of the numerical simulations and the theoretical approach .",
    "the outcome is summarized in sec .",
    "[ sec : conc ] along with some general remarks .",
    "recently we introduced a simple model of community isolation @xcite whose basic rules can be described in the following way : in each time step one puts a representative of specie ( @xmath2 ) or ( @xmath3 ) in a random , unoccupied node in a chain of @xmath4 nodes .",
    "the specie can be an individual belonging to a given community or a person characterized by a certain opinion .",
    "the probabilities of choosing either of the possible specie ( community birth rates ) are equal to @xmath5 . if @xmath6 nodes filled with identical species ( e.g. , @xmath7 ) get surrounded by individuals belonging to other community ( e.g. , @xmath8 ) ,",
    "the nodes inside the cluster are called _ blocked _ and they no longer interact with the rest of the system . this model can be easily extended onto a case with multiple number of different species @xmath9 - then , similarly as in the two - specie case , the type of the specie is drawn from the uniform distribution @xmath10 . to form an isolated cluster ,",
    "a set of identical species has to be surrounded by other identical species ( e.g. , 23332 ) .",
    "the analytical treatment shows that the approximated equation for the number of blocked nodes @xmath11 for specific time of the simulation @xmath12 is @xmath13 it follows , that regardless of the number of different species introduced in the chain , the number of blocked nodes grows roughly as @xmath14 .",
    "the form of eq .",
    "( [ eq : zold ] ) gives the opportunity to directly obtain the _",
    "characteristic time _",
    "@xmath1 i.e. , the time when the first isolated node appears @xmath15 the approach is quite consistent with the numerical simulations and works also in case of other topologies such as lattices or random graphs @xcite .",
    "in this paper we are investigating the asymmetric case of the model @xcite .",
    "symmetry breaking is introduced as an external bias and is received by changing birth rates of different species occurring in the system , either by a simple imbalance in the two - specie case or by setting a specific specie probability distribution in the multi - specie one .",
    "we shall consider the model of isolation of communities on a @xmath0-dimensional lattice . in this kind of graphs clusters of nodes sharing the same specie",
    "will be isolated when neighbors ( in the sense of von neumann neighborhood @xcite ) of all their elements are connected only with each other or with a different specie .",
    "an example of isolated cluster on the square lattice is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : kulki ] .",
    "first , we consider two species ( @xmath2 and @xmath3 ) which we put into @xmath0-dimensional hypercubic lattice with a total number of sites @xmath16 .",
    "occurrence probabilities @xmath17 and @xmath18 of both species are non - equal and given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the symmetry breaking parameter .",
    "these probabilities are microscopic parameters , which describe model evolution . starting from a lattice of empty nodes ,",
    "after @xmath12 time steps we have the following probabilities that a randomly picked node is occupied with the specie @xmath2 or @xmath3 @xmath21    now let us consider numbers of blocked nodes @xmath22 , @xmath23 of both species at time @xmath12 .",
    "these numbers are well approximated by numbers of individual blocked nodes , i.e. by numbers of blocked clusters of size one of both species . when the total density of all blocked nodes is small ( @xmath24 ) then @xmath25 @xmath26 substituting the values @xmath27 and @xmath28 with eq .",
    "( [ eq : pr1 ] ) and taking into account ( [ eq : peps ] ) the above relations for @xmath29 may be expressed as @xmath30 @xmath31    the above equations allow us to calculate characteristic times @xmath32 and @xmath33 when the first representative of either of both species emerges .",
    "putting @xmath34 ( analogously for @xmath3 ) we obtain after a short algebra @xmath35^{\\frac{1}{2d+1}},\\ ] ] @xmath36^{\\frac{1}{2d+1}}.\\ ] ]      if we consider more than two species , we can use probability distribution @xmath37 instead of the previously introduced probabilities @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "it requires changing microscopic probabilities @xmath38 and @xmath39 with the value of @xmath40 .",
    "the connection between these two sets of variables is given by the equation @xmath41 for @xmath42 ( the case @xmath40 independent of @xmath43 corresponds to the symmetric problem considered in @xcite ) . using the same approximation as in the two - specie case",
    "we can obtain that @xmath44 for @xmath42 , which , taking into account ( [ eq : priapproxd ] ) becomes @xmath45 putting @xmath46 one obtains a set of characteristic times for each specie @xmath43 @xmath47^{\\frac{1}{2d+1 } } \\ \\ \\ i= 1 , 2 , ... \\ ] ]",
    "here we are presenting the comparison between the analytical approach given in the previous section and the results obtained from the numerical simulations performed for topologies of @xmath0-dimensional lattices .      while comparing eq .",
    "( [ eq : zold ] ) for @xmath48 and eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zupdeps]-[eq : zdowndeps ] ) for specific value of @xmath49 one can notice that the introduction of the symmetry breaking does not have any effect on the dependence of the number of blocked nodes with regard to the time of the evolution .",
    "however , investigation of @xmath23 and @xmath22 as a function of the parameter @xmath49 for a fixed value of time @xmath12 brings some not so obvious results .",
    "figure [ fig : z]a - b shows the dependence of the number of blocked nodes of each specie versus the symmetry breaking parameter @xmath49 obtained in the numerical simulations compared with the theoretical expectations given by eqs ( [ eq : zupdeps]-[eq : zdowndeps ] ) .",
    "the discrepancies between simulation results and the theoretical approach can be justified by the approximations used in obtaining @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "still , one can immediately spot the main difference between those two quantities : @xmath22 is monotonic while @xmath23 first increases , reaches a prominent and well defined maximum and then drops down .",
    "this observation is backed with a simple analysis of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : zupdeps]-[eq : zdowndeps ] ) : in fact the derivative @xmath50 for the whole range @xmath51 and in the case of @xmath23 there is a maximum value for @xmath52 the decrease of @xmath22 is rather obvious as it is the dominant specie according to eq .",
    "( [ eq : peps ] ) - the higher is the number of its individuals introduced in the system the smaller is the probability of this specie being blocked . on the other hand as it concerns @xmath23 , eq .",
    "( [ eq : emax ] ) suggests that there exists a specific value of @xmath49 for which the number of blocked individuals reaches the highest rate .",
    "it follows that this value depends only on the dimensionality of the system ( i.e. , the number of the nearest neighbors ) .",
    "this phenomenon is even more pronounced while examining the characteristic times @xmath32 and @xmath33 versus @xmath49 presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : z]c - d .",
    "the first quantity exhibits a constant growth and the second one possesses a clear minimum for @xmath53 which is consistent with the maximum values for @xmath23 observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : z]a - b .      for the asymmetric multi - specie case we used the geometric probability distribution @xmath54 this very case of probability distribution has been chosen as an example as it quite easily yields the analytical approach .",
    "moreover it can be transformed directly into continuous exponential distribution assuming that @xmath55 .",
    "first we shall discuss the issue of the global characteristic time @xmath1 .",
    "it can be approximately calculated by assuming that the total number of blocked species at time @xmath12 is equal to @xmath56 .",
    "( [ eq : geo ] ) the global characteristic time can be expressed as @xmath57^{\\frac{1}{1 + 2d}}\\ ] ] figure [ fig : tct ] presents the characteristic time versus parameter @xmath58 given for different values of @xmath0 and @xmath4 . in each case",
    "the curve has a similar shape , exceeding @xmath59 for both small and large values of @xmath58 ( horizontal lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tct ] ) with a well defined minimum between .",
    "moreover , for a specific value of @xmath4 the curves , regardless of the dimensionality of the system , seem to intersect in one point .",
    "in fact , a closer analysis reveals that for @xmath60 eq .",
    "( [ eq : tct ] ) takes a form of @xmath61 resulting in the intersection point @xmath62 , shown as vertical lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : tct ] . a heuristic explanation of this fact can be also derived in the following way : as long as the probability of drawing the second specie ( @xmath63 ) is above @xmath64 there is a statistical chance of it appearing in the system and thus being blocked by the overwhelming first specie ( @xmath65 ) .",
    "as soon as the probability drops below that value there is only one specie and so the blocking is impossible . on the other hand , when @xmath58 approaches 1 , the number of different species is relatively high and all the probabilities @xmath40 are close to @xmath66 . after crossing a certain value @xmath67 the number of the individuals of the first specie is too low to make possible any blocking on the lattice .",
    "the obvious necessary condition preventing this scenario is that @xmath68 which leads to @xmath69 and eventually gives @xmath70 .",
    "finally fig .",
    "[ fig : tct ] suggests that there is some specific value of @xmath58 for which the characteristic time is the lowest ; assuming that @xmath71 one can estimate this value with @xmath72 we stress here that the critical value of @xmath73 given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : qstar ] ) is independent on the system size @xmath4 similarly as the critical value of the @xmath74 parameter given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : emax ] ) .",
    "one can also focus directly on the question of characteristic times @xmath75 of various species . substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : ttid ] ) with ( [ eq : geo ] ) one gets the general formula for the characteristic time of @xmath43-th specie being blocked in the topology of the @xmath0-dimensional lattice @xmath76^{\\frac{1}{2d+1}}.\\ ] ] the comparison of the characteristic times @xmath75 versus parameter @xmath58 obtained in numerical simulations and the theoretical expectations given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcd ] ) is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcq ] . the plots for @xmath75 bear close resemblance to those obtained for @xmath1 . following a similar line of thought as in the case of the global characteristic time it is possible to estimate the crucial points of these curves .",
    "first of all , eq . ( [ eq : tcd ] ) can be approximated as @xmath77 which is valid for all @xmath78 .",
    "however , in order to estimate @xmath60 when the above function intersects with @xmath79 , one uses a further approximation i.e. , @xmath80 .",
    "it effects in quite straightforward formula for the intersection point being @xmath81 , which suggests that the intersection point should be dependent only on the number of nodes in the lattice , while its dimension @xmath0 is irrelevant .",
    "figure 4 also gives clear evidence that the characteristic times for the first specie behave differently than those for @xmath82 , in both cases it is the specie @xmath63 which gets blocked first for smaller values of @xmath58 .",
    "moreover in the case of @xmath83 the results from @xmath84 cover with @xmath85 and in the case of @xmath86 with @xmath87 .",
    "this last fact is fully comprehensible after comparing both equations in ( [ eq : tcd1 ] ) where , after short algebra , one gets that the characteristic time for the first and @xmath88-th specie are the same .",
    "one can also notice comparing eqs ( [ eq : tct ] ) and ( [ eq : tcd ] ) that it is in fact @xmath89 that plays the dominant role in creating the shape of the global characteristic time @xmath1 and may be used as its good approximation .",
    "taking into account eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcd1 ] ) it is possible to estimate the maximal specie number that gets blocked in the environment for a fixed value of the system size @xmath4 . the curves presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcq]a - b indicate that for each @xmath43 there is a specific value @xmath90 for which the function @xmath75 takes its minimum .",
    "it follows , that as long as @xmath91 the specie will be blocked , at least for @xmath92 .",
    "closer analysis of eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcd1 ] ) leads to @xmath93 after substituting eq .",
    "( [ eq : tcd1 ] ) with the above values of @xmath90 , one gets the value of characteristic time in the minimum . a corresponding plot for different values of dimension @xmath0 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tcq]c .",
    "it gives immediately the idea of the fast restriction of the blocked specie number with system s dimension : while for @xmath83 the value of @xmath43 can be as large as 70 , in the case of @xmath94 it substantially drops down to 6 .",
    "furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : tcq]c underlines again the specific role of the first specie showed in the previous paragraph .",
    "in this paper we have extended the simple model of community isolation onto the case with the symmetry breaking .",
    "our calculation and numerical simulations show that even a simple way of introducing the external bias between species can lead to interesting and non - trivial results .",
    "we have found that both in the two - specie case where a parameter @xmath49 governs the symmetry breaking and in the multi - specie case where the numbers of each entity are given by the geometric distribution there exists some specific and well defined value of the control parameter giving a minimum of the characteristic time @xmath1 . in general",
    "the value of this parameter is dependent only on the dimensionality of the lattice .",
    "we have also shown that the requirement of a non - blocked system in the multi - specie case leads to two , somehow opposite conditions : either there has to be a strictly dominant specie , outnumbering the others or the diversity should be very large . in the end we have also given evidence that the number of blocked species of different kinds decreases with the dimension of the system .",
    "the presented results can be easily further generalized to the cases of other topologies ( e.g. complex networks ) and other kinds of biases .      6 c. gardiner , _ handbook of stochastic methods _ , springer - verlag , berlin ( 2004 ) .",
