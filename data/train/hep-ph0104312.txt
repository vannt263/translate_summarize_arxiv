    "a few years ago , a new paradigm for addressing the gauge hierarchy problem was proposed @xcite . in the so - called `` large extra dimensions scenario , '' ( add scenario ) the explanation for the large discrepancy between the weak scale and the planck scale is that the fundamental scale of gravity is actually close to the weak scale , and that gravity seems weak to us because it propagates in more , compact , dimensions , while standard model fields are bound to four - dimensional subspaces embedded into the higher dimensional world .",
    "one of the challenges for the add scenario is solving the well known problems of proton stability , absence of flavour changing neutral current processes , etc .",
    "the situation is particularly problematic because one has to consider nonrenormalizable operators which are only suppressed by powers of the `` quantum gravity scale '' and whose coefficients are completely unknown since they parametrise our ignorance concerning the physics above the ultraviolet cutoff .",
    "it is important to ask whether there are `` low energy '' mechanisms guaranteeing that most of these dangerous terms are appropriately suppressed , independently of the unknown beyond - quantum - field - theory physics .",
    "a novel solution to the higher - dimensional flavour problems was proposed by arkani - hamed and schmaltz @xcite ( as scenario ) .",
    "they argue that if we live in a `` fat '' four - dimensional spacetime ( fat brane ) , it is possible to effectively suppress unwanted higher dimensional operators by localising different fermion fields to different coordinates in the extra dimensions . as was also pointed out in @xcite , and further explored in @xcite , this solution also provides an interesting explanation for the hierarchy of the quark masses and the values of the ckm mixing angles and cp - violating phase .",
    "it should be pointed that the as scenario leads to startling consequences @xcite , which may be observed at next - generation collider experiments .    in this paper , we address the issue of lepton flavour violating phenomena in charged lepton decays and neutrino masses in the as scenario . the as scenario is natural for solving flavour changing problems , and indeed we find that it can very efficiently suppress charged lepton flavour violating decays such as @xmath1 .",
    "one of the issues we explore here is whether suppressing such processes imposes any interesting constraint on lepton masses and mixing angles .",
    "we find , for example , that the charged lepton mass matrix is forced to be quasi - diagonal , and that almost all the mixing in the lepton sector _ must _ come from the neutral sector .",
    "such a situation is certainly not observed in the quark sector ( for an example , see @xcite ) , and seems to already constrain some extra - dimensional neutrino mass scenarios .",
    "the as scenario also provides a natural mechanism for obtaining small dirac neutrino masses , which has not yet been explored in the literature .",
    "it is important , therefore , to study whether similar success is obtained in explaining , for example , the large leptonic mixing angle which is required by neutrino oscillation solutions to the atmospheric neutrino puzzle @xcite .",
    "we will show that in order to obtain large mixing angles , separations between different leptonic fields have to be closely related .",
    "the situation appears to be rather finely tuned when the flavour constraints mentioned above are also imposed .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .  2",
    ", we address the problem of flavour changing neutral currents in the add paradigm and how it is solved in the as scenario .",
    "we concentrate on flavour violating charged lepton decays . in sec .  3",
    ", we address the issue of lepton masses and mixing angles in a straightforward extension of the as scenario , namely , adding right - handed neutrinos to the fat brane .",
    "we first discuss how `` naturally '' the as scenario can explain the large hierarchies observed in the quark and fermion sectors , and what is required in order to obtain large mixing angles .",
    "we then analyse two - family models in great detail , concentrating on the constraints that must be met in order to obtain large mixing angles .",
    "finally , we discuss solutions to the neutrino puzzles in the case of three generations . in sec .  4",
    ", we discuss a mechanism for obtaining small neutrino masses without right - handed neutrinos . here",
    ", constraints from the charged lepton sector severely restrict solutions to the neutrino puzzles .",
    "our conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "it is a general principle of effective field theories that all operators consistent with the exact symmetries of nature are present , including nonrenormalizable , `` irrelevant '' operators .",
    "these operators are understood as being suppressed by the large energy scale above which the effective field theory is no longer applicable .",
    "these include , for example , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 refer , respectively , to quark and lepton @xmath4 doublets , while @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 denote , respectively , up - type antiquark , down - type antiquark , and antilepton @xmath4 singlets .",
    "@xmath8 is the @xmath4 higgs boson doublet . ] which mediates proton decay and @xmath9 , which breaks lepton number and gives the neutrinos a majorana mass after electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it is also well known that @xmath10 is constrained to be at least of the order of the grand unification scale ( @xmath11  gev ) by the fact that the proton lifetime is larger than @xmath12  years @xcite . on the other hand , values of @xmath13  gev",
    "are required in order to correctly account for the atmospheric neutrino puzzle via neutrino oscillations .    in theories where the `` quantum gravity '' scale is small ( a few tev ) ,",
    "one is faced with the challenge of explaining why , even though @xmath14  tev , phenomena which violate the conservation of `` accidental '' global symmetries have not been copiously observed .",
    "the two irrelevant operators mentioned above can be eliminated by assuming , for example , that ( gauged ) @xmath15 is a true symmetry of nature ( probably weakly broken , if one wants to explain the matter ",
    "antimatter asymmetry of the universe ) , but other dangerous operators still remain .",
    "these include operators that violate individual flavour number conservation and mediate phenomena such as meson  antimeson mixing and flavour changing neutral currents .",
    "one intriguing solution to these problems was proposed by arkani - hamed and schmaltz @xcite .",
    "they postulate that the standard model fields are constrained to a `` fat brane , '' which is infinite in three space directions and occupies a finite volume in @xmath16 extra , orthogonal , compact dimensions .",
    "it is also postulated that gauge fields and the higgs scalar can freely propagate in the entire volume of the fat brane , but fermions are confined to specific `` points . '' finally , if one assumes that different fermion fields are located at _ different _ points in the extra dimensions , it is easy to see that some operators are `` forbidden '' by locality , _ e.g. , _ an operator such as @xmath2 can be very efficiently suppressed simply because @xmath17 s and @xmath3 s live in different worlds , and do nt `` see '' one another @xcite .    in this section",
    "we discuss , within the scenario described above ( as scenario ) , what requirements are imposed on the distances between different leptonic fields in order to account for the ( negative ) experimental searches for charged lepton decays which violate lepton flavour number . here",
    "we will concentrate on the lepton flavour violating muon decays @xmath18 and tau decays in our discussion .",
    "the reason for this is that the constraints imposed by these channels are far weaker than those imposed by @xmath19 , as will become clear shortly . ]",

    "one obtains , for example , @xmath33 and @xmath34 assuming one extra dimension and defining the higher - dimensional wave - function of the fermions to be gaussians of width @xmath35 centred at position @xmath36 and @xmath37 for @xmath38 and @xmath39 , respectively .",

    "( [ l - lgamma],[l-3l ] ) and assuming the as scenario , it is easy to compute the branching ratios for the various lepton decays ( see , for example , @xcite ) as a function of @xmath10 ( the `` quantum gravity '' scale ) and the distance between different lepton fields .",

    "only nonzero @xmath57 and @xmath58 coefficients were considered .",
    "the reason for this is simple : given the requirements imposed by the non - observation of @xmath59 and @xmath44 , the contribution of @xmath60 are strongly suppressed , while @xmath61 are , a priori , unconstrained .",
    "therefore , in this case , @xmath48 is either @xmath62 or @xmath63 for the muon decay and @xmath64 or @xmath65 for the tau decay , in units of @xmath54 .",
    "some comments are in order .",
    "first of all , it must be said that the as scenario , as expected , is very efficient when it comes to suppressing rare lepton decays . even for @xmath66  tev , the most stringent requirement ( from @xmath43 )",
    "is that @xmath67 @xcite ) .",
    "second , one may wonder how strict the constraints are since , after all , there are order one coefficients floating about .",
    "it is easy to see that things do not change significantly if these coefficients are allowed to vary .",
    "for example , varying @xmath68 from 0.3 to 3 , the lower bound on @xmath69 from @xmath70 and @xmath49  tev changes by @xmath71 .",
    "a remaining question is what do these bounds imply for lepton masses and mixing angles",
    ". this will be addressed in the next sections .    before proceeding , however , it is worthwhile mentioning at this point that other lepton flavour violating decays , such as @xmath72 , hadronic tau decays and @xmath73@xmath74 conversion in nuclei ) mediates @xmath73@xmath74 conversion in nuclei at higher order in qed ( in the case of the magnetic moment operators ) and at higher loop level and higher order in qed in the case of the four - fermion operators .",
    "the constraints imposed on the operators are not as strict as the ones from lepton flavour violating charged lepton decays . ] have not been considered , since they can be safely suppressed by assuming that quarks and leptons are well separated ( which is generically required in order to suppress proton decay ) , and that the distance constraints obtained in these cases do not play a significant role when it comes to addressing lepton masses and mixing angles .",
    "another intriguing possibility is using the as scenario to explain the current hierarchy of fermion masses and mixing angles @xcite .",
    "indeed , it has been shown that localising different quark fields to different points in the extra dimensions is an efficient and `` natural '' way of explaining not only all quark masses and mixing angles @xcite , but also the observed cp violation in the quark sector @xcite .    in this section",
    ", we study whether the same idea can be used to explain lepton masses .",
    "charged lepton masses were already discussed in the context of massless neutrinos @xcite , but no similar study has been performed for neutrino masses .",
    "the idea is quite simple .",
    "we assume the existence of three standard model singlet fermions , which we refer to as right - handed neutrinos ( @xmath75 ) , and assume that these are also localised at different points in the extra dimensions .",
    "if this is the case , neutrinos acquire ordinary dirac masses after electroweak symmetry breaking , exactly like the quarks and charged leptons . in the as scenario , the explanation for the smallness of the neutrino masses is straightforward : neutrino masses are tiny because @xmath75 s and @xmath3 s are separated by distances which are only slightly larger ( as will become clear later ) than , for example , the @xmath17 s and @xmath6 s .",
    "it will turn out , as we will discuss in detail later , that the most serious challenge for the as scenario with right - handed neutrinos in the brane will be to naturally account for the large mixing angles in the lepton sector which are required in order to solve the neutrino puzzles @xcite .    before proceeding ,",
    "it is worthwhile to digress a little on the philosophy behind the as scenario when it comes to explaining fermion masses and mixing angles . perhaps the most attractive , and",
    "certainly the novel idea behind the as scenario is the possibility of solving the flavour problem without postulating new , horizontal symmetries .",
    "instead , it is simply assumed that the fermions are separated by distances of a few ( in units of the width of the fermionic higher dimensional wave - function @xmath54 ) , which could be chosen at random .",
    "all the work is done by the gaussian suppression of the effective four dimensional yukawa coupling ( as discussed in the previous section .",
    "see also @xcite ) : @xmath76 where @xmath77 are the positions of the different fermion fields ( @xmath78 ) .    in order to further quantify the `` naturalness '' concept ,",
    "let us assume that , say , a @xmath17 and a @xmath5 fields are localised in one extra dimension , of size @xmath79 ( see @xcite for a discussion on the expected size of @xmath80 ) .",
    "if the positions are chosen completely at random it is easy to show that the probability of finding @xmath81 between some value @xmath82 and @xmath83 is given by @xmath84 , where @xmath85 it is straightforward to compute the probability that the suppression due to the small overlap between the two extra dimensional wave - functions is of a given order of magnitude .",
    "[ fig : random ] depicts the probability that the suppression factor is in some order of magnitude bin .",
    "it should be noted that while the figure only depicts suppression factors larger than @xmath86 , the probability that the suppression factor is smaller than @xmath87 is almost 10% !    as expected , very tiny suppression factors can be obtained , even if all fields are constrained to lie relatively close to one another .",
    "an important fact is that , while random choices for the positions ( in one extra dimension ) seem to favour effective yukawa coupling which are suppressed by an order of magnitude with respect to their higher dimensional counterparts , the probability of obtaining a large spread of suppression factors is quite large .",
    "it is this property which renders the as solution to the fermion mass hierarchy attractive ",
    "random choices for the distances seem to provide a large spread for values of the yukawa couplings , and therefore the observed hierarchies are naturally explained .",
    "one can further pursue this logic and see what are the consequences for the mixing angles .",
    "we use a toy model of only two families of up - type quarks as an example , but it will become clear in due time that it is easily generalised to include three families and down - type quarks .    the mass matrix can be written as @xmath88 where @xmath89 is roughly the top quark mass and @xmath90 are the suppression factors .",
    "the message from fig .",
    "[ fig : random ] is that , `` normally '' one expects @xmath91 ( for example ) .",
    "if this is the case , one can trivially show that the matrix that diagonalizes @xmath92 is parametrised by one mixing angle , @xmath93 , such that @xmath94 ,",
    "@xmath93 is either close to 0 or @xmath95 , such that the mixing is quite suppressed .",
    "while this situation fits very nicely the quark masses and mixing angles , it poses serious problems for leptons , given that , according to the neutrino oscillation solution to the neutrino puzzles , at least one of the leptonic mixing angles is `` large . ''",
    "this is in sharp contrast to standard four dimensional approaches to the fermion mass puzzles .",
    "there , quark masses require a significant amount of underlying structure in order for one to understand the hierarchy of masses and the small mixing angles , while it has been argued that neutrino masses can be obtained from operators with random order one couplings @xcite .",
    "the same is true in the case of the `` simplest '' neutrino mass model @xcite , where neutrino masses are obtained via the introduction of one single right - handed neutrino and the use of @xmath96 operators .    in order to obtain large mixing angles , it is imperative that some elements of the mass matrices are of the same order . using eq .",
    "( [ 2x2_matrix ] ) as an example , it is again simple to show that , if one wants @xmath97 , @xmath98 ( for example ) is required .",
    "the challenge is , therefore , to obtain a mechanism satisfying this condition .",
    "flavour symmetries , for example , would certainly do the job , but they would spoil the most attractive feature of the as scenario . a different option , which still maintains the extra - dimensional nature of the as scenario , is to assume that , as a consequence of the underlying localising mechanism , some fields are positioned on top of each other , and that some distances are , therefore , `` naturally '' very similar .    with this in mind",
    ", we proceed to discuss how realistic lepton masses and mixing angles can be obtained in the as scenario .",
    "we first discuss the simpler two family case , and further address the issue of how `` finely tuned '' certain parameters have to be in order to obtain large mixing .",
    "later , we discuss solutions for the more involved case of three families .      in this subsection we address in detail the case of only the two `` heavy '' lepton families , concentrating on the observed large mixing which seems to be required in the @xmath99 sector according to neutrino oscillation solutions to the atmospheric neutrino puzzle .",
    "it proves convenient to consider separately the different configurations which potentially yield maximal mixing in order to understand what constraints over the space of locations have to be met in order to obtain the appropriate mass - squared difference and mixing angle .",
    "these configurations are depicted in fig .",
    "[ geoms ] .",
    "two important comments concerning our discussion are in order .",
    "first , we assume that the order one coefficients which accompany the exponential suppressions ( the higher dimensional yukawa couplings ) play no significant role , and set all of them to unity .",
    "we comment on the relevancy of this approximation later .",
    "second , we impose that there is no significant mixing coming from the charged lepton sector .",
    "it turns out that , specially when considering only the @xmath99 sector , the non - observation of @xmath70 combined with the requirement that the obtained @xmath100 mass agrees with the experimental value automatically forces the mixing in the charged lepton sector to be small .",
    "note that the constraint of small mixing in the charged lepton sector will be considered _ a posteriori _ , and its consequences analysed for each of the different configurations .    by imposing the @xmath70 constraint as discussed in the previous section , one obtains @xmath101  @xmath102 for @xmath49  tev ( 5  tev ) , which in turn means that the off - diagonal elements of the ( two generations ) dirac mass matrix for the charged leptons are less than ( approximately ) @xmath103  mev for @xmath104 , where @xmath105  gev is the top quark mass ( for details concerning the choice of @xmath89 , see @xcite ) .",
    "this , in turn , implies that one of the diagonal elements is _ necessarily _ of the order of the tau mass , while the other elements are at most of the order of the muon mass . in summary , @xmath106 where @xmath107 are numbers which are at most order one , @xmath108 , and @xmath109 are the muon and tau masses , respectively .",
    "note that eq .",
    "( [ 2gen_charged ] ) is written in such a way that its eigenvalues are @xmath110 and @xmath111 up to @xmath112 . in this case , it is easy to estimate the mixing angle , namely , @xmath113 which is quite small .    a fact that will prove very important in the future is that , even though there is no direct significant limit on @xmath114 from @xmath115 decays ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - egamma ] ) , it is geometrically constrained because @xmath116 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath117 ,  mev corresponds to a distance of @xmath118 , and @xmath119  mev to a distance of @xmath120 . ]",
    "independent of the number of extra dimensions .",
    "therefore , as a guarantee that there are no large flavour changing effects in the charged lepton sector , a good rule of thumb is to keep @xmath121 , in which case the mixing in the charged lepton sector is necessarily small .",

    "more so than the atmospheric parameters !",
    "note that a very similar behaviour is observed when perturbing around plow , where the @xmath73@xmath100 fields also fall into the configuration discussed in case a in the previous subsection .",
    "we conclude this subsection with a summary of the results and a word of caution . we have numerically scanned the one - dimensional parameter space of three neutrino generations and encountered , out of many `` good '' candidates ( which yield small neutrino masses ) , only a handful of points which could potentially accommodate the neutrino data .",
    "as expected from our qualitative discussion at the beginning of this section , the great majority of the points ( @xmath224 ) fails to yield large enough mixing in the solar and/or atmospheric sectors .",
    "the situation is particularly constrained after @xmath172 is required to be small .",
    "all the points identified had configurations and fine - tuning characteristics similar to the ones discussed in the previous subsection ( see fig .  [ geoms ] ) , with different choices for the position of the first generation fields .",
    "we selected four examples consistent with the different solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle , and studied the stability of these solutions in order to address how `` special '' the distances between lepton fields have to be in order to obtain a particular result .",
    "we find that small modifications ( of order a few percent of the typical distance scale ) seem to maintain the large mixing in the atmospheric sector , in agreement with the discussion in the previous subsection , while changing the solar parameters and @xmath172 by many orders of magnitude .",
    "for two specific cases we identified the origin of this effect .",
    "therefore , it seems that obtaining appropriate solar parameters requires tuning more parameters ( or the same parameters more tightly ) than what is already required in order to obtain large mixing in the atmospheric sector .",
    "it should be emphasised that we have not attempted a detailed study of the three by three neutrino mass matrix in order to study correlations between the various distances , but decided to base our conclusions on a few `` case studies . ''",
    "it is not clear to us whether such a study is practical and/or illuminating .",
    "therefore , the conclusions we reached , although quite plausible and reasonable , should be read with some caution .",
    "as mentioned in sec .  2 , the traditional see - saw mechanism is not an option for generating very small neutrino masses in the case of models with a small quantum gravity scale .",
    "nonetheless , one may still obtain small _ majorana _ neutrino masses in the add scenario .",
    "the idea , proposed in @xcite , is to take advantage of the `` infrared desert '' @xcite to obtain very small symmetry breaking effects .",
    "more explicitly , the idea is to impose lepton number as a conserved global symmetry , which is broken at some far away brane .",
    "lepton number violating effective operators would be generated in our brane , suppressed by @xmath225 where @xmath226 is some typical mass scale and @xmath227 is the distance between the branes ( see @xcite for details ) .    for our purposes",
    ", it is enough to assume that the following majorana neutrino mass matrix is generated after electroweak symmetry breaking : @xmath228 where @xmath229 is the overall majorana mass scale , @xmath230 are the higher dimensional order one couplings .. ] the distances @xmath231 are the same distances between the different left - handed lepton fields discussed in the previous sections .",
    "the issue we would like to deal with in this section is whether phenomenologically acceptable majorana mass matrices can be obtained , if one assumes that the absence of flavour violating decays of the muon and the tau and the hierarchy of the charged lepton masses are explained by the as scenario .    in the absence of the flavour changing constraints",
    ", it is clear that solutions can be found : if one places all lepton doublets on top of one another , large mixing in the solar and atmospheric sector arises quite naturally , and even a small @xmath172 and moderate hierarchy in the masses - squared can be obtained @xcite . with the flavour changing constraints ,",
    "however , the situation is more involved , since the lepton doublet fields _ can not _ sit on top of one another , as we argued in sec .",
    "note that if all distances were @xmath232 all off - diagonal terms would be one order of magnitude smaller than the diagonal terms , and obtaining large mixing in the atmospheric sector , for example , would require some fine - tuning among the diagonal elements , which we do not consider acceptable .",
    "note that the situation deteriorates very quickly as @xmath233 grows , due to the gaussian dependency of the off - diagonal coefficients .",
    "therefore , the first issue we will address is how small can we make @xmath233 without running into contradictions with flavour violating charged lepton decays .    from the previous sections",
    ", we learn that @xmath234 , while @xmath235 .",
    "note that the lower limits can not be simultaneously saturated due to the ( much more stringent ) @xmath236 bounds and the requirement that the charged lepton mass hierarchy is explained within the as scenario .",
    "for example , if we require @xmath237 , in one extra dimension , @xmath238 , while @xmath239 . in two or more extra dimensions ,",
    "it is possible to obtain @xmath240 while keeping @xmath234 ( in which case , @xmath241 is very close to its lower bound ) .",
    "it should be kept in mind that this situation is very `` special , '' and the branching ratios for @xmath55 and @xmath242 are very close to the current experimental bounds @xcite .",
    "therefore , the `` best '' possible scenario seems to be : the @xmath243-element is suppressed by at least @xmath244 with respect to the diagonal elements , while one of the other off - diagonal elements ( we choose it to be the @xmath245-element ) can be suppressed by only @xmath246 with respect to the diagonal terms .",
    "the remaining off - diagonal element ( we will choose it to be the @xmath247-element ) is suppressed by 0.05 . at this point , one may ask whether it is possible to find , without carefully choosing the order one @xmath230 coefficients , phenomenologically viable neutrino masses and mixing angles .    in order to answer this question , we perform the following `` search . ''",
    "we parametrise the neutrino majorana mass matrix by @xmath248 where we randomly choose values for @xmath249 between 0.3 and 3.0 , while randomly choosing values for @xmath150 between 0 and 0.1 .",
    "the @xmath243-entries have been set to zero for simplicity .",

    "all these points are incompatible with the current neutrino data , of course . ]    more significant than the figures , perhaps , are the following numerics : 51% of the points yield @xmath259 , while 22% ( 1.5% ) of the points yield @xmath260 ( @xmath261 ) , and 38% of the points yield @xmath262 ( note that the values of @xmath257 we obtain are not small enough to accommodate the low of vac solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle ) . combining all constraints ,",
    "1.5% satisfy @xmath259 , @xmath263 , @xmath264 , @xmath265 ( lma - like solution ) and 0.1% satisfy @xmath259 , @xmath266 , @xmath267 , @xmath265 ( sma - like solution ) .",
    "what do these numbers imply ?",
    "while most points do not yield phenomenologically acceptable parameters , there is a slightly more than 1% chance for obtaining the lma solution with completely random order one yukawa couplings",
    ". we do not consider this too `` unlikely , '' but leave definitive conclusions to the reader .",
    "one concrete statement , however , is that obtaining the sma solution under these conditions is certainly less likely ( 15 times ) .",
    "the reason for this is that the sma solution requires a larger hierarchy for the mass - squared differences , which is very hard to obtain with order one random yukawa couplings .    what happens as the separation between left - handed lepton fields increases ?",
    "[ random](bottom , left ) depicts the obtained values of @xmath254 if the same procedure is repeated , except that the suppression factor for the @xmath245-element is increased by a factor of 10 ( from 0.5 to 0.05 ) .",
    "the results are rather striking .",
    "unlike the previous case , depicted in fig  [ random](top , left ) , large atmospheric mixing becomes more `` rare '' ( 11% of the points yield @xmath259 ) , especially when @xmath257 is required to be small ( 0.04% percent ( none ) of the cases satisfy @xmath259 and @xmath268 ( 0.01 ) ! ) .",
    "therefore , in light of the observed hierarchy of neutrino mass - squared differences , large mixing in the atmospheric sector becomes exceedingly unlikely as the separation between @xmath269 and @xmath270 increases .    on the other hand , fig .",
    "[ random](bottom , right ) depicts the obtained values of @xmath255 when the original procedure is again performed , but restraining @xmath271 . when compared to fig .",
    "[ random](top , right ) , it is easy to see that large mixing in the solar sector happens for a smaller fraction of all randomly generated matrices .",
    "the number of potentially good candidates is still reasonable : 28% of all matrices yield @xmath262 . here",
    ", however , the probability of obtaining lma - like solutions ( see discussion related to fig .  [ random](top ) ) decreases ( 0.3% compared to 1.5% ) , while the number of sma - like solutions remains the same .",
    "of course , this behaviour is expected , and the situation deteriorates very rapidly as the upper bound on @xmath150 decreases .    in summary ,",
    "if neutrinos have a naturally small majorana mass matrix , the as solution to flavour changing charged lepton decays and the hierarchy of charged lepton masses naturally predicts that the neutrino masses are not strongly hierarchical and that mixing angles are rather small . in order to obtain large enough atmospheric mixing angles ,",
    "we were forced to live very close to the current experimental bounds imposed by the searches for charged lepton flavour violation .",
    "we dare not make any precise predictions given the qualitative nature of our estimates , but if flavour violating @xmath73 and ( especially ) @xmath100 decays are not observed by the next generation of experiments @xcite , the scenario discussed in this section will be severely constrained , if not entirely ruled out .",
    "this is to be contrasted to the study in the previous section , where neutrino mixing angles were also generically predicted to be small , while the masses were hierarchical . in order to obtain large mixing angles ,",
    "we were forced to impose specific positions for the different leptonic fields .",
    "all solutions we found were either immediately ruled out by searches for lepton flavour violating processes , or predicted that their branching ratios were severely suppressed , out of reach of any foreseeable experiment . the price paid for these solutions was having to finely tune _ a priori _ unrelated distances to more than 1 part in @xmath272 .",
    "we have analysed the issue of charged lepton flavour violation and neutrino masses in the fat - brane paradigm proposed by arkani - hamed and schmaltz ( as scenario ) .",
    "the as scenario is particularly suited for explaining the absence of lepton flavour violating muon and tau decays , and can also naturally explain why neutrinos are more than ten orders of magnitude lighter than the top quark , if right - handed neutrinos are introduced _ in the brane_. we found that , indeed , the branching ratios for flavour violating muon and tau decays can be very easily suppressed to levels below the current experimental bounds , and that very small neutrino masses can be obtained for separations of order @xmath273 .",
    "the as scenario , however , seems to have a harder time accounting for the large neutrino mixing which has been observed in the atmospheric neutrino data .",
    "this is a peculiar feature of the as scenario for fermion masses : it naturally accommodates large mass hierarchies and small mixing angles , while it seems to require additional `` structure '' ( _ e.g. , _ different pairs of fields have to be separated by very similar distances ) in order to explain large mixing angles .",
    "we studied the case of two lepton families in detail .",
    "the situation seems `` finely tuned '' when the the bounds imposed by charged lepton flavour violation are also taken into account .",
    "we showed that the charged lepton mass matrix is constrained to be quasi - diagonal , and that , in order to obtain large atmospheric mixing and the appropriate @xmath136 , distances which are _ a priori _ unrelated are required to agree with one another better than one part in 100 .",
    "we proceeded to analyse the case of three lepton flavours , and while we found that all the different solutions to the solar neutrino puzzle can be accommodated while keeping the absolute value of the @xmath190 element of the leptonic mixing matrix small , we argued that the amount of fine - tuning required to simultaneously satisfy all neutrino data is `` larger '' than in the two - family case .",
    "we then proceeded to discuss the effect of explaining the absence of flavour changing tau and muon decays and charged lepton masses in the as scenario on theories where small majorana neutrino masses are generated by breaking lepton number in a far away brane . in this case , in order to obtain large mixing in the atmospheric sector , we were forced to `` approximate '' different lepton doublet fields to the point that the current experimental upper bounds on the branching ratios of some rare tau and muon decays were almost saturated .",
    "therefore , we expect these rare decays to be observed in the next round of experiments , if such a scenario were indeed realised in nature . furthermore , very hierarchical neutrino mass - squared differences were not attainable , meaning that the solar neutrino puzzle would have to be solved either by the sma or the lma solutions .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to emphasise that , in spite of the fine - tuning problems we highlighted in sec .  3 ,",
    "the as scenario should be regarded as a novel mechanism for understanding small mixing angles , which does not necessarily require the existence of fat branes or even large extra dimensions .",
    "similar results are obtained in models with many different `` thin '' branes which are separated in the extra dimensions .",
    "furthermore , if the extra dimensions are not large ( and the hierarchy problem is solved by some other means ) , our results for neutrino masses and mixing angles would still apply , except for the flavour changing constraints from charged lepton decays , which would be absent . finally , the fine - tuning which we pointed out could ( and should , in our opinion ) be interpreted as a challenge to be faced by candidates for the localising mechanism and/or the structure of the compact dimensions .",

    "it should be noted that during the numerical scan we did not find any matrix which yields an inverted mass hierarchy and is consistent with the constraints imposed above .",
    "the results of the scan are best described in words . out of roughly @xmath299 initially selected matrices , only 440 fall within the window defined above .",

    "96% fail to satisfy the @xmath173 constraint . from the remaining points ,",
    "97% fail the @xmath300 constraint , while 98% of the remainder fall out of the @xmath172 bound .",
    "note that only one out of roughly 5 million events survives all the constraints we define above .",
    "many comments are in order .",
    "first , in should be readily noted that the two `` angle constraints '' combine to remove 99.9% of the candidate matrices , ten times more than the `` mass constraints . ''",
    "second , it should be pointed out that the mass constraints and the angle constraints `` commute '' , in the sense that , independent of the order in which they are applied , the percentage of the points which is removed is the same .",
    "this implies that there is no correlation between the values of the masses and the values of the mixing angles .",
    "the same is not true for the @xmath173 and @xmath300 constraints .",
    "third , the @xmath172 constraint is highly correlated with the angle constraints .",
    "if applied first , the @xmath172 constraint only cuts a small fraction of all the matrices , while if applied last , it removes a very significant fraction of the events which pass the angle constraints .",
    "therefore , events which have a small @xmath301 generically have very small mixing in the solar and/or the atmospheric sector .",
    "this can be understood from the qualitative discussion included in the beginning of sec .  3 : the as scenario prefers small mixing angles , and a generic set of points will yield a mixing matrix which has only `` 0s '' and `` 1s '' ( one 1 for each column and row ) .",
    "therefore , if we impose @xmath172 small , the generic matrices which are left have some other @xmath302 and @xmath303 which is close to one , which necessarily means that @xmath304 are either very large or very small .    the selected points yield a varied spectrum of solar angles and masses - squared , and no value of @xmath174 and @xmath173 is strongly preferred .",
    "all points , without exception , choose the second and third generation fields to fall into either the configuration depicted in fig .",
    "[ geoms](a ) or fig .",
    "[ geoms](b ) ( note that the configurations where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are exchanged are , of course , also present in equal numbers ) , while @xmath274 and @xmath305 are placed in various locations .",

    "this constraint is sufficient for satisfying all flavour changing constraints described in sec .  2 and also guarantee that the mixing in the charged lepton sector is negligible .",

    "<S> we address the issue of lepton flavour violation and neutrino masses in the `` fat - brane '' paradigm , where flavour changing processes are suppressed by localising different fermion field wave - functions at different positions ( in the extra dimensions ) in a thick brane . </S>",
    "<S> we study the consequences of suppressing lepton number violating charged lepton decays within this scenario for lepton masses and mixing angles . in particular , we find that charged lepton mass matrices are constrained to be quasi - diagonal . </S>",
    "<S> we further consider whether the same paradigm can be used to naturally explain small dirac neutrino masses by considering the existence of three right - handed neutrinos _ in the brane _ , and discuss the requirements to obtain phenomenologically viable neutrino masses and mixing angles . finally , we examine models where neutrinos obtain a small majorana mass by breaking lepton number in a far away brane and show that , if the fat - brane paradigm is the solution to the absence of lepton number violating charged lepton decays , such models predict , in the absence of flavour symmetries , that charged lepton flavour violation will be observed in the next round of rare muon / tau decay experiments .    </S>",
