    "hadronic reactions at modern collider energies reach a kinematical domain where gluon densities can be nonperturbatively large even at short distance scales where the qcd coupling is weak . a convenient effective theory of qcd in this regime is provided by the color glass condensate ( see e.g. @xcite ) , which describes the nonlinear small @xmath0 degrees of freedom in a hadron or nucleus as a classical color field",
    ". an ideal way to study these dense color fields is to probe them with simple dilute probes in a high energy collision , such as in deep inelastic scattering or forward particle production in proton - nucleus collisions . in the latter case",
    "the dilute probe is provided by the relatively well understood large @xmath0 partons of the probe proton which , at forward rapidity , scatter off the small @xmath0 color field of the target .",
    "several calculations  @xcite of forward single inclusive particle production in this framework have provided a good description of available experimental data using the leading order expression for the cross section  @xcite . as is often the case in qcd",
    ", the leading order calculations leave the overall normalization of the cross section quite uncertain .",
    "it would , therefore , be desirable to systematically go to higher orders in perturbation theory in these cross section calculations .",
    "similar developments towards higher order have recently taken place concerning the ( balitsky - kovchegov ( bk )  @xcite or jimwlk ) high energy evolution equations  @xcite , and dis cross sections  @xcite .    an important advance in pushing the cgc framework to nlo accuracy",
    "was the calculation @xcite of nlo single inclusive particle production in forward proton - nucleus collisions ( see also the earlier works @xcite ) .",
    "we will here refer to the cross section formulae derived in refs .",
    "@xcite as the `` cxy '' result according to the authors .",
    "here it was shown that the divergences in the rapidity ( or longitudinal momentum ) and transverse momentum integrals appearing in the nlo calculation can be factorized into the bk and dglap evolution of the target and projectile , respectively . in a subsequent calculation",
    "@xcite it was shown that in the large transverse momentum limit the calculation reduces to the appropriate tree - level process in collinear factorization , although in this case without a factorization of the rapidity divergence .    in the first numerical implementation  @xcite of the factorization framework of",
    "@xcite the nlo corrections turned out to be large and negative at large transverse momenta of the produced particles , to the extent that the total cross section becomes negative .",
    "a solution to this problematic behavior has been suggested to lie in the detailed implementation of the factorization of the rapidity divergence  @xcite or in a kinematical constraint that must be imposed on the phase space of emitted gluons  @xcite .",
    "indeed a recent implementation  @xcite of this phase space constraint has alleviated the problem , without however removing it completely .    in this paper , we suggest an alternative way of implementing bk - factorization in the calculation of chirilli et al .",
    "@xcite that combines aspects of these previous works .",
    "our suggestion includes , as in  @xcite , an explicit rapidity factorization scale in the `` hard functions '' of the nlo part of the cross section . since the dependence of the cross section on this scale cancels against the rapidity scale to which the target is evolved , the total cross section formulation is explicitly independent of this factorization scale .",
    "here we suggest implementing the `` kinematical constraint '' or , more precisely , ordering in light cone energy , by making this factorization scale dependent on the transverse momentum of the produced particle .",
    "we show that this allows for a renormalization prescription that makes the negative large momentum contribution to the cross section arbitrarily small .",
    "combined with a corresponding form of the bk equation this should in the future make it possible to resum the problematic contributions at large transverse momentum similarly as recently suggested for the nlo bk equation  @xcite .    for simplicity we will here only address the quark channel @xmath1 and perform numerical calculations only for the golec - biernat and wsthoff ( gbw )  @xcite parametrization of the dipole cross section .",
    "the gaussian @xmath2-spectrum at leading order in the gbw model has the advantage for the purpose of this paper of being very clearly distinct from the power - law behavior of the nlo contributions .",
    "this exacerbates the problem of negative cross sections and should therefore put any attempt to stabilize the perturbative expansion to a more stringent test .",
    "a fuller phenomenological analysis of single inclusive particle production would require implementing also the gluon initiated channel , and a more realistic bk - evolved dipole cross section .",
    "ultimately this should include a solution of the nlo bk equation  @xcite and a simultaneous nlo fit to dis data . at present",
    "we leave these further steps for future work .",
    "this paper is structured as follows .",
    "we will first , in sec .",
    "[ sec : nlosinc ] briefly recall cxy results  @xcite for the nlo corrections to the cross section in the quark - initiated channel and how the factorization into dglap and bk evolution is performed there .",

    "most important for our discussion here is the momentum fraction @xmath16 : the fragmenting quark carries a fraction @xmath16 of the incoming quark longitudinal momentum .",
    "thus the incoming quark has a momentum fraction @xmath17 of the incoming proton , where @xmath18 is the probe momentum fraction in leading order kinematics .",
    "the radiated gluon in the nlo terms carries a longitudinal momentum fraction @xmath19 : i.e. the limit @xmath20 corresponds to the soft gluon emission that must be resummed into bk evolution of the target .",
    "these cross sections are all expressed in terms of the fourier - transform of the fundamental representation dipole operator @xmath21 the dipole is related to the notation of @xcite by an overall integration over the impact parameter @xmath22 in the following we leave out the explicit impact parameter dependence of @xmath23 from our notation . due to the unitarity of the wilson lines",
    "@xmath24 the dipole cross section satisfies the normalization condition @xmath25 the expressions here use the mean field approximation , replacing the expectation value of the product of two dipole operators by the product of two expectation values @xmath26 .",
    "the superscript @xmath27 refers to the fact that at this stage the dipole operator in the leading order part of ( [ eq : nlosigma ] ) is the unrenormalized `` bare '' dipole operator .",
    "as noted in  @xcite , several important features are already visible in these expressions .",
    "first , the terms with an explicit coefficient @xmath28 ( i.e. @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) vanish in the limit @xmath31 but have collinear divergences in the transverse momentum integration .",
    "these are nicely treated in  @xcite by dimensional regularization in the transverse momentum integrals and factorized into the dglap evolution of the quark distribution function @xmath32 and the fragmentation function @xmath33 . for these `` @xmath28-terms '' we will here follow the treatment of  @xcite . the terms with a coefficient @xmath34 ( we will denote these as the `` @xmath35-terms '' in the following ) , i.e. @xmath36 and @xmath37 , have finite transverse integrals , one has to note that at large @xmath38 one can use the normalization ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) to perform the @xmath39 integral , leading to a cancellation between the uv - divergences in the two terms of @xmath37 . ] but are finite in the limit @xmath40 .",
    "thus they produce a rapidity divergence due to the explicit factor @xmath41 in the expression for the multiplicity .",
    "if one takes the large @xmath35-limit , there are additional cancellations between some @xmath28 and @xmath35-terms that are used in  @xcite ; we will , however , not take this limit here .",
    "in the cxy calculation the rapidity divergence is subtracted by defining a renormalized dipole cross section as @xmath42 .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] expressed in coordinate space this reduces to a more familiar looking form in terms of an integral form of the bk renormalization group equation  @xcite @xmath43 .\\end{gathered}\\ ] ] as pointed out in  @xcite , this subtraction really should include an explicit rapidity factorization scale .",
    "the remaining nlo cross section would then depend on this factorization scale , which cancels at this order in perturbation theory against the rapidity up to which the dipole cross section in the leading order cross section is evolved .",
    "this is completely analogous with the subtraction of the collinear divergences into dglap evolution in the @xmath28-terms , which leaves the nlo cross sections explicitly dependent on a transverse momentum factorization scale .",

    "now we can see that if @xmath57 is chosen to be very close to one ( i.e. if one makes sure to subtract only terms that have a very large energy logarithm ) , the contribution of the last @xmath35-term ( integrated from @xmath57 to 1 ) is negligible @xmath58 .",
    "the first two @xmath35-terms , on the other hand , yield a large logarithmic contribution @xmath59 from the upper limit of the integration .",
    "it is instructive to see how these expressions for the subtracted cross section behave in the opposite limits of small and large transverse momentum for the produced quark . at large transverse momentum",
    "the result can be easily obtained from @xcite , where the unsubtracted cross sections have been matched to collinear perturbation theory . in the large @xmath2 limit",
    "only the radiative corrections contribute and the leading behavior comes from @xmath60 where the integrated gluon distribution is @xmath61 with @xmath62 the transverse area of the target hadron .",

    "means that the subtracted @xmath35-term in eq .",
    "( [ eq : subtracted1 ] ) , @xmath63,\\ ] ] will yield a contribution that behaves as a power in @xmath2 and is negative due to the growing @xmath16-dependence of @xmath64 in this limit . for values of @xmath57 close to 0 , the magnitude of this negative term is larger than the one of the ( positive ) @xmath28-term",
    ". therefore , if the leading order cross section falls rapidly at large @xmath2 ( as in the gbw parametrization ) , the leading large @xmath2 behavior comes from the nlo corrections and the cross section is negative .",
    "thus the negativity of the nlo cross section can be traced back to the fact that the unsubtracted cross section at large @xmath2 is proportional to @xmath16 .",
    "subtracting , as in cxy ( see ( [ eq : cxysub ] ) ) , the integral over the whole @xmath16-interval multiplied by the cross section at @xmath65 subtracts a very large finite contribution in addition to the divergent part .",
    "_ this oversubtraction of the rapidity divergence is what makes the cross section negative at large transverse momenta .",
    "_ this was the main point in  @xcite , where the authors showed that reintroducing a part of this oversubtracted contribution again makes the cross section positive .",
    "when we increase @xmath57 towards 1 , the large negative contribution dies away .    for practical purposes ,",
    "this is not a formalism that we would wish to use for extremely small transverse momenta , since the independent vacuum fragmentation picture of hadron production is probably not a valid physical picture there .",
    "however , from a formal point of view it can be instructive to see what happens in the small @xmath2 limit .",
    "the fact that bk evolution preserves the dilute limit @xmath66 when @xmath67 , i.e. the sum rule ( [ eq : sumrule ] ) , tells us that the quantity @xmath68 , which is positive in the large @xmath2 limit , must be negative in some other regions of phase space .",
    "indeed , if we denote by @xmath69 the contribution that is added to @xmath70 in one rapidity step of bk evolution , the sum rule ensures that the @xmath71-integral of @xmath69 is zero . at large @xmath2",
    ", @xmath68 is positive .",
    "therefore , if we increase @xmath57 we subtract a smaller but positive contribution and thus the cross section increases . on the other hand , at smaller @xmath2 we expect @xmath68 to be negative and the cross section to decrease with increasing @xmath57 .",
    "as both @xmath36 and @xmath37 are free of ir and uv divergences , we can estimate their leading order behavior by using @xmath72 with @xmath73 , which allows us to figure out the small @xmath2 limit of @xmath36 and @xmath37 as @xmath74 here @xmath75 and @xmath76 are some hard momentum scales which are much larger than @xmath2 and @xmath77 is chosen such that the integral of @xmath78 equals to @xmath79 $ ] with @xmath80 the integral of the function @xmath81 . from the above expressions ,",
    "we see that both @xmath36 and @xmath37 have logarithmic divergences at @xmath82 and @xmath83 .",

    "therefore @xmath86 has to be @xmath87 at @xmath65 .",

    "therefore we would expect that the subtracted multiplicity will increase at large @xmath2 and decrease at small @xmath2 in the gbw model with the increasing of @xmath57 .      in this section",
    "we illustrate the features we have discussed so far using the gbw model to parametrize the dipole cross section @xmath105 .",

    "is given by @xmath112 , where @xmath113 corresponds to the leading order kinematics : @xmath114 .",

    "this feature is known as the `` kinematical constraint '' or as imposing `` exact kinematics ''  @xcite , a terminology that we will comment on in sec.[sec : disc ] .",
    "imposing @xmath3-ordering has also been one ingredient in the program of `` small-@xmath0 resummation '' in the context of the linear bfkl evolution  @xcite .",
    "since we are working in a frame where we consider the gluons as being emitted from the probe , the emitted gluon always has a smaller @xmath133 momentum than its parent quark ; the emissions are therefore naturally ordered in @xmath133 .",
    "the requirement of @xmath3 ordering , on the other hand , must be imposed separately .    at leading order ,",
    "the physical picture of the scattering is that of an incoming collinear quark ( i.e. with only a @xmath133 momentum component ) that acquires a transverse momentum and light cone energy ( @xmath71 and @xmath3 ) from the target . considering the production of a quark with a fixed @xmath71 ,",
    "the light cone energy required is @xmath134 the fraction of the target momentum required to set the produced quark on shell is defined by the leading order kinematics as @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the momentum of the target .",
    "thus we can write @xmath137 .",
    "we now want to implement @xmath3-ordering in the calculation of the single inclusive cross section . for this purpose",
    "let us consider the emission of a gluon from the incoming quark that is present in all of the contributing diagrams .",
    "labeling the transverse momentum of the incoming quark as @xmath38 and radiated gluon as @xmath39 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : q2qg ] ) , the light cone energy introduced from the gluon emission is @xmath138 \\nonumber \\\\   & = \\frac{x_g p^-}{{{\\mathbf{k}}}^2 } \\frac{({\\mathbf{l}}-(1-\\xi){{\\mathbf{q}}})^2}{\\xi(1-\\xi)},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the momentum fraction of the emitted gluon . in some diagrams",
    ", the splitting happens before the interaction with the target and @xmath139 , in final state radiation diagrams @xmath140 .",
    "similarly , for some diagrams , but not all , the quark does not interact with the target after the emission and @xmath141 . in general , the momenta @xmath142 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : kminusqg ] ) are integrated over in the diagram , whereas the transverse momentum @xmath71 is that of the produced quark and is kept fixed ( at a fixed fragmentation @xmath143 ) .",
    "it appears as an overall prefactor in ( [ eq : kminusqg ] ) when the incoming quark longitudinal momentum @xmath144 is expressed in terms of the target variables @xmath113 and @xmath136 and is therefore common to all diagrams contributing to the cross section .",
    "we now want to derive a renormalization group equation describing the target .",
    "this means that emissions in a certain kinematical regime have to be subtracted from the cross section and absorbed into a redefinition of the target , as was done in eq .",
    "( [ eq : cxysub ] ) .",
    "in particular , this kinematical regime to be subtracted should include the limit @xmath145 .",
    "now the requirement of a @xmath3-ordering in the evolution means that the subtraction criterion should be a condition on @xmath146 . since @xmath147 for @xmath40",
    ", this means that fluctuations around @xmath65 with @xmath146 larger than a certain factorization scale should be subtracted .",
    "thus , our renormalization scheme is defined by the condition that all the contributions with @xmath148 are to be subtracted from the cross section .",
    "most importantly , we want the subtracted region to include contributions with @xmath149 where @xmath150 is in principle an arbitrary factorization scale that will appear both in the leading order term as the rapidity up to which the target must be evolved , and in the hard factors of the nlo cross section .",
    "we emphasize that ( [ eq : kminusorder ] ) is not a ( momentum conservation ) kinematical constraint for the process , but a renormalization condition specifying which parts of phase space should be subtracted from the cross section .",
    "a natural choice that resums all the large energy logarithms into the evolution is to take @xmath151 . in the typical kinematical regime when all the transverse momenta are of the same order , @xmath152 for all @xmath16 , and we can safely subtract the whole @xmath16 interval as done in @xcite . however , when the produced quark momentum @xmath71 is much larger than the typical target scale @xmath92 , there are configurations where the @xmath3-ordering condition ( [ eq : kminusorder ] ) is not satisfied for all @xmath16 , because @xmath39 is integrated over in a range that includes typical target scales @xmath153 .",
    "thus we should , for large @xmath71 , only subtract values of @xmath16 close to 1 that satisfy @xmath154 or @xmath155 this line of argument leads us to our proposal to implement @xmath3-ordering or the `` kinematical constraint '' by subtracting a @xmath2-dependent fraction of the @xmath16 integral from the cross section as @xmath156,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath157 note that since there is a factorization scale @xmath158 in the limit , we have the freedom to change this scale with a factor of order 1 .",
    "this change should cancel against a corresponding change in the rapidity to which the dipole amplitude is evolved .",
    "an alternate , somewhat smoother form with the same parametric behavior would be @xmath159 where we can vary the factorization scale @xmath158 in an interval such as @xmath160 .    in practice , the two choices  ( [ eq : xifmin ] ) and  ( [ eq : xifcontinuous ] ) lead to very similar results .",
    "therefore we will only show results obtained with the smoother choice  ( [ eq : xifcontinuous ] ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : dn_xifcontinuous ] and  [ fig : ratio_xifcontinuous ] we show the multiplicity as a function of @xmath121 for three values of the ratio @xmath158 . in the three cases , the nlo multiplicity still becomes negative for some value of the transverse momentum . for @xmath161 or 2",
    "this happens approximately at the same point as for @xmath45 , as can be seen by comparison with fig .",
    "[ fig : dn_nocutoff ] . on the other hand , for @xmath162",
    "the multiplicity is positive up to a significantly larger value of @xmath121 of the order of 6  gev . for comparison",
    "we also show in fig .",
    "[ fig : dn_xifcontinuous ] the results obtained by following the approach of ref .",
    "@xcite , where the original cxy subtraction is used but a kinematical constraint is imposed which leads to an additional correction term @xmath163 . this additional term extends the @xmath121 range where the multiplicity is positive by about 0.5  gev , which is similar to what was obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite in the same kinematics .",
    "this is the main result of our paper : we have shown that it is possible to choose a value of @xmath158 which is still in its `` natural '' range and extends significantly the region where the nlo cross section has a reasonable physical behavior . in the case",
    "we have studied here the dependence on the exact choice for the renormalization scale is stronger than one would like , but we believe that this is due to two aspects of the calculation that can be improved in the future .",
    "first , we tried here to implement ordering in an effective way by relying only on external scales to fix @xmath57 . for more accurate results",
    ", one should instead impose the ordering  ( [ eq : kminusorder ] ) inside the transverse momentum integrals in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this could lead to sizeable differences with the results we have shown since , as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : dn_xifcontinuous ] , our results are still very sensitive to the value of @xmath57 .",
    "second , we have used the gbw model to parametrize the dipole cross section . while this has practical advantages like enabling us to perform some integrals analytically , in this model the leading and next - to - leading order contributions have very different behaviors at large transverse momentum",
    ": the leading order term behaves like a gaussian , while the next - to - leading order corrections behave like a power law .",
    "therefore , at large transverse momentum , the behavior of the multiplicity is governed entirely by the nlo corrections , which is quite unnatural . on the other hand , using a more physical dipole cross section , such as one obtained by solving the balitsky - kovchegov  @xcite equation , should make the leading order contribution behave more like a power law .",
    "this means that the end result would be less sensitive to the exact choice made for the parametrization of @xmath57 . taking a bk - evolved dipole cross section instead of the gbw one would also make the cross section formally independent of the factorization scale @xmath150 at this order in @xmath164 , which should significantly reduce the factorization scale dependence .    ) of @xmath57 for different values of @xmath165 compared with the results at leading order and when using the correction term @xmath163 introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite . ]    ) of @xmath57 for different values of @xmath165 . ]",
    "to summarize , we have in this paper proposed to modify the subtraction procedure of the rapidity divergence in the calculation of single inclusive hadron production in the hybrid formalism  @xcite .",
    "it has been hoped that imposing ordering in the light cone energy of the probe could solve the issue of large negative nlo corrections to the cross section .",
    "we have here argued that the most natural way to implement this ordering is to impose it on the kinematics of the part that is subtracted from the cross section and absorbed into the target . to explicitly demonstrate the effect of our proposal , we have performed the calculations at finite @xmath35 for the gbw model .",
    "the part corresponding to the rapidity divergence is proportional to @xmath35 , whereas the parts associated with dglap evolution have a color factor @xmath28 .",
    "compared to the cxy formulation , our suggestion only modifies the @xmath35-terms and leaves the @xmath28-terms unchanged .",
    "indeed , we have shown that such a modification of the subtraction scale can lead to a more stable perturbative expansion for this cross section at high @xmath121 . by a suitable choice of the factorization scale @xmath150",
    ", the stability of the perturbative expansion can be extended to arbitrarily high @xmath121 .",
    "this should be contrasted with the recent calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , where a similar correction is obtained as an additional correction which in some cases still leaves the cross section negative at high enough @xmath121 .",
    "the main difference between our approach here and that of ref .",
    "@xcite is that there the kinematical modification is treated as a single correction term whereas here it is resummed to all orders by shifting the evolution variable in the bk equation .    in some works ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ", the kinematical constraint is explained as a requirement of keeping the momentum fraction in the target @xmath166 as less than @xmath167 .",
    "we would rather prefer to characterize this requirement by saying that the @xmath166 of the corrections that are resummed into the bk evolution should be larger than the @xmath113 determined by the leading order kinematics .",
    "the whole formalism here is based on the eikonal approximation , which is valid for only small enough @xmath166 .",
    "if the actual result for the cross section were to really depend on the dipole cross section at very large target @xmath166 , the whole formalism would be in grave trouble .",
    "fortunately this is not the case , since the contribution from large @xmath168 ( corresponding to @xmath169 ) is subtracted from the cross section and absorbed into the renormalization group evolution of the target : in fact it is only a tiny part of the subtraction . in spite of this different terminology , the actual equations in refs .",
    "@xcite lead to the same parametric dependence that we have here : the longitudinal factorization scale has to be modified by the presence of a large transverse momentum logarithm @xmath170 .    in order to perform the whole calculation consistently at nlo accuracy",
    ", one needs to also solve the nlo version of the bk equation . to do this ,",
    "the actual bk equation to be solved must be consistent with the subtraction procedure in the cross section .",
    "different subtraction schemes correspond to different versions of the bk equation . since the rapidity dependence of the dipole cross section is proportional to  @xmath164 , a modification of the subtraction scale in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlzsub ] ) is a higher order @xmath171 effect , and the difference appears at the nlo level for the bk equation .",
    "in fact , it was recently shown in @xcite that a problematic double logarithmic correction to the nlo bk equation  @xcite can indeed be resummed by redefining the evolution variable in a similar way as we have done in eq .",
    "( [ eq : dlzsub ] ) .",
    "when written as a differential equation in @xmath172 , the modified bk equation is nonlocal in rapidity , which is inconvenient for a numerical solution .",
    "the authors of  @xcite proposed a clever way of rewriting this in a local form , which has successfully been solved numerically  @xcite .",
    "compared to the work in @xcite , our proposal here has been a very simplistic one . by explicitly taking @xmath92 as the scale of the logarithm , we have been able to write a subtraction procedure in such a way that we can reuse most of the cxy formulae with only slight modifications . to be consistent @xcite , the momentum scale in eq .",
    "( [ eq : xifmin ] ) should actually be one that is integrated over in @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "this would require a new computation of the regularized `` hard factors '' remaining after the subtraction .",
    "for a calculation that is consistent with recent nlo bk solutions it would be useful to carry out this subtraction for the resummation proposed in @xcite .",

    "<S> recent calculations of this process at the next - to - leading order accuracy have led to negative cross sections at large transverse momenta . </S>",
