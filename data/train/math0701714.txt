    "we say that all identities in a subset of @xmath16 are _ equivalent _ if each of them defines the same variety of loops .",
    "in this sense , most of the varieties of bol - moufang type can be defined in several equivalent ways .",
    "it is then a nontrivial task of practical importance to describe all maximal subsets of equivalent identities in @xmath16 .",
    "in fact , this work was partially motivated by the authors frustration with the inconsistencies in the literature concerning definitions of loop varieties .",
    "this paper presents the classification of all varieties of _ loops of bol - moufang type _ , i.e. , varieties of loops defined by one identity from @xmath16 .",
    "we determine the variety defined by each identity @xmath16 and conclude that there are 14 such varieties , including groups , bol loops , moufang loops and c - loops .",
    "we then describe the inclusions among all these varieties and provide all necessary distinguishing examples .",

    "let @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 be all the variables appearing in the identities of @xmath16 . without loss of generality , we can assume that they appear in the terms in alphabetical order .",
    "then there are exactly @xmath20 ways in which the @xmath5 variables can form a word of length @xmath6 , and there are exactly @xmath21 ways in which a word of length @xmath6 can be bracketed , namely : @xmath22 let @xmath23 with @xmath24 , @xmath25 be the identity from @xmath16 whose variables are ordered according to @xmath26 , whose left - hand side is bracketed according to @xmath27 , and whose right - hand side is bracketed according to @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , @xmath29 is the identity @xmath30 .",
    "it is now clear that any identity in @xmath16 can be transformed into some identity @xmath23 by renaming the variables and interchanging the left - hand side with the right - hand side .",
    "there are therefore @xmath31 `` different '' identities in @xmath16 .",
    "the _ dual _ of an identity @xmath32 is the identity obtained from @xmath32 by reading it backwards , i.e. , from right to left .",
    "for instance , the dual of @xmath33 is the identity @xmath34 . with the above conventions in mind , we can rewrite the latter identity as @xmath35 .",
    "one can therefore identify the dual of any identity @xmath23 with some identity @xmath36 .",
    "the name @xmath36 of the dual of @xmath23 is easily calculated with the help of the following rules : @xmath37    finally , we will use the following notational conventions : we usually omit @xmath8 while multiplying two elements ( eg @xmath38 ) , we declare @xmath39 and @xmath40 to be less binding than the omitted multiplication ( eg @xmath41 ) , and if @xmath8 is used , we consider it to be less binding than any other operation ( eg @xmath42 ) .",
