    "the correct quantization of collective coordinates has been a central issue in the study of soliton models .",
    "for example , in the skyrme model @xcite baryons are solitons of an @xmath0 quiral lagrangian and internal degrees of freedom ( spin and isospin ) are described as collective excitations of the soliton @xcite .",
    "these collective excitations typically appear as zero energy fluctuations around a classical solution which breaks certain invariance of the action . to deal with the zero modes the degrees of freedom associated with the collective motion",
    "should be isolated .",
    "as this is difficult to do in general , collective coordinates can be introduced explicitly as _ additional _ degrees of freedom .",
    "this procedure has become known as the collective coordinate method @xcite .",
    "the general way to introduce collective variables is as parameters of transformations of the original fields @xcite .",
    "the transformed theory , which depends upon the overcomplete set of original fields plus collective variables , is a gauge theory .",
    "the most rigorous treatment of gauge theories is the becchi - rouet - stora - tyutin ( brst ) quantization procedure @xcite .",
    "the application of the brst method to the quantization of collective coordinates in finite systems has been developed in @xcite .",
    "the brst quantization of collective coordinates or fields in the case of field theory was presented in @xcite .",
    "simple solitonic models have also been studied using these framework @xcite .    in finite systems and soliton models ,",
    "collective coordinates are introduced as parameters of the symmetry transformations which are broken ( or partially broken ) by the classical solutions .",
    "the resulting gauge theory is quantized following the usual canonical brst procedure .",
    "lagrange multipliers and ghosts are introduced for each gauge freedom .",
    "an hermitian , nilpotent brst charge is constructed , and physical states and operators are defined as those invariant under the global brst symmetry .",
    "the gauge theory is thus replaced by a gauge - fixed brst theory , in which the collective variables become physical , and the zero modes are cancelled by the lagrange multipliers and the ghosts .",
    "the brst quantization can be formulated as a lagrangian path integral by means of the antifield formalism @xcite .",
    "given a gauge theory with its corresponding ghosts , antifields are introduced , and an antibracket structure is defined . the gauge - fixed brst action is obtained from the solution of the so - called master equation .",
    "everything is formulated directly in the space of lagrangian variables .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to apply the brst treatment of collective coordinates in the lagrangian path integral framework to the motion of a particle in a riemannian manifold .",
    "this model includes the skyrme and the @xmath1 models , as well as very simple cases which can be used to verify the calculations @xcite .",
    "although this model could be treated with the usual faddev - popov techniques , the antifield method should be necesary to treat for example supersymmetric solitons when the supersymmetric algebra closes on - shell ( i.e. up to terms proportional to equations of motion ) .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec.[sm ] we describe the model and the group @xmath2 of transformations that leave the action invariant .",
    "the classical solution to the equations of motion , as shown in sec.[sscc ] , is only invariant under a subgroup @xmath3 of @xmath2 , giving rise to zero modes .",
    "collective coordinates have to be introduced to restore the broken symmetry .",
    "this yields a gauge invariant action .    in sec.[af ]",
    "the antifield formalism is applied to the quantization of the gauge invariant action .",
    "a brst gauge - fixed lagrangian action is constructed , and the path integral for the quantization is set up .",
    "an equivalent result can be obtained from the hamiltonian approach , as mentioned in sec.[hbq ] .",
    "sec.[pt ] discusses the perturbative computation of the partition function .",
    "expressions for the free propagators and interaction vertices are given .",
    "two - loops corrections to the intrinsic energy levels are calculated ( formally ) with the aid of finite temperature techniques , and a collective hamiltonian to one loop is obtained .",
    "these results are shown to be free of any dependence upon spurious parameters introduced by the gauge - fixing procedure .",
    "one aspect not treated in the present paper is the ultraviolet renormalization since it depends on the particular model to which the formalism is applied .",
    "finally , our conclusions and outlook are given in sec.[sc ] .",

    "the interesting case is that in which there are several classical minima related by transformations of @xmath2 whereas quantum mechanically there is only a single vacuum because @xmath2 is unbroken ( this is not the case of spontaneous symmetry breaking in which there are many _ quantum _ vacua ) .",
    "choosing a particular classical minimum brings in infrared divergencies which spoil the calculation ( excitations tangent to the surface of minima have zero restoration frequency ) .",
