    "comets are considered to be primordial , icy bodies which are expected to retain imprints of physical conditions prevailing in the proto - solar system .",
    "therefore , study of comets has proved very useful in our understanding of the origin of the solar system .",
    "sun light is scattered by the cometary grains and in this process it gets polarized .",
    "the degree of polarization ( p % ) mainly depends on : the size distribution of the grains and their refractive index ( @xmath3 ) ; wavelength of the light and the phase angle ( sun - comet - earth angle , @xmath4 ) .",
    "linear polarization measurements have been made on many comets to help understand their grain properties .",
    "the first major efforts for detailed polarization observations were made for comet p / halley by many groups @xcite .",
    "there were other bright comets after p / halley such as comet c/1989 x1 ( austin ) , c/1996 b2 ( hyakutake ) , and c/1995 o1 ( hale - bopp ) for which polarization observations were reported ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a database of comet polarimetry has been created by @xcite which also includes some unpublished data .",
    "+ the study of the dust grains in comets has been an active area of investigation for quite some time but the nature and composition of the cometary grains are still not well understood .",
    "a study of the variation of polarization with phase angle ( @xmath4 ) and the wavelength dependence of polarization helps to characterize the dust grains .",
    "based on the data obtained by various researchers , @xcite established a typical polarization - phase curve describing the variation of the degree of linear polarization with the phase angle : small negative values of polarization for phase angle @xmath4 @xmath5 22@xmath6 , increasing nearly linearly in the range 30 @xmath5 @xmath4 @xmath5 70@xmath6 and reaching a maximum value of 15 - 35 % in the phase angle range 90 - 110@xmath6 .",
    "@xcite pointed out the possibility of the grains giving rise to the polarization being large , rough and dark , resembling fluffy aggregates such as idps .",
    "in - situ measurements @xcite by space missions to comet halley and corresponding numerical simulations by @xcite contributed important information on the nature of grains in that comet .",
    "return of the dust particles by the stardust space mission @xcite , has been a wonderful achievement in the study of cometary material .",
    "the preliminary studies suggest that most of the particles larger than a micron are anhydrous ( dry ) silicates or sulfides .",
    "they include forsterite ( mg@xmath7sio@xmath8 ) , an olivine end - member that is one of the first condensates from the solar nebula . apart from their amorphous nature , some such silicate minerals are crystalline solids as also inferred from ir studies in comet hale - bopp @xcite and deep impact mission comet 9p / tempel 1 @xcite .",
    "the range of iron / magnesium ratios exhibited by the particles indicates that comet wild 2 is unequilibrated .",
    "the comet contains an abundance of silicate grains that are much larger than the predictions of interstellar grain models , and many of these are high - temperature minerals that appear to have formed in the inner regions of the solar nebula .",
    "their presence in a comet proves that the formation of the solar system included mixing on the grandest scales @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that so many of the impacting comet particles contained at least a few relatively large solid grains , an order of magnitude larger than the size of typical interstellar grains @xcite .",
    "in addition to silicates and abundant sulfides , the collected comet samples contain organic materials @xcite .",
    "the mixing of material from inner and outer solar nebula as indicated by the wild 2 coma samples returned by stardust and the great heterogeneity in comet nucleus make up shown by the gas and dust coming out of the deep impact comet 9p / tempel 1 @xcite , make it more challenging to pin down the region of the formation of comets .",
    "it also underlines the need for more studies in this direction .",
    "space experiments are very expensive and demand long lead time .",
    "therefore , data collected using ground based facilities play a significant role in this study .",
    "ground based observations have indicated the detailed behavior of grains to change from one comet to another .",
    "this fact is corroborated by the deep impact , startdust and comet halley space missions also . at a basic level",
    ", the size distribution of impacted wild 2 grains is different from the ejecta of the tempel 1 @xcite and even that seen in the comet halley .",
    "for example , as per deep impact results , comet 9p / tempel contains mgfe sulfides and carbonates , at odds with stardust samples .",
    "these sulfides are also absent in idps .",
    "so , either the comet compositions are different or sampling regions are different",
    ". another possibility could be improper laboratory constituents used to model deep impact spectra @xcite . until more in - situ measurements are carried out on many other comets , the information about dust grains in the comets has to come largely from ground based observations in conjunction with theoretical models / simulations @xcite .",
    "+ on the basis of the polarization behavior of 13 comets , @xcite pointed out the existence of two types of comets : gassy and dusty .",
    "subsequently @xcite and @xcite expanded this work by studying the polarization phase curve for a large number of comets .",
    "quantitatively , for @xmath4 @xmath9 30@xmath6 it was thought that comets follow two distinct distributions in the polarization - phase angle diagram leading to two classes of comets : low polarization and high polarization comets @xcite with high polarization comets being dusty and low polarization comets gassy .",
    "@xcite present a strong argument in favour of the two classes of comets .",
    "they claim a strong correlation of the polarization behaviour with the strength of the 10@xmath10 m silicate feature which is a direct signature of the dust grains . however , it is to be noted that cometary classification by ir spectra and by polarization values is highly correlated @xcite .",
    "any comet may belong to either class depending upon the dust activity .",
    "also , the differences in the extent of polarization in the two classes could be due to molecular emission contamination @xcite . in case of the gassy comets ,",
    "the emission from molecules covers large fraction of the spectrum and contaminates the continuum , thus lowering the degree of polarization . +",
    "the apparition of comet neat c/2001 q4 provided a good opportunity to make polarimetric observations at large phase angles which are useful to study cometary composition . during the observing run in may - june 2004 , the comet was conveniently located in the sky and was bright enough to achieve good s / n ratio . in this communication we report the polarization observations made in may 2004 with the phase angle range @xmath11 , and later in june with phase angle range @xmath12 and discuss the results obtained .",
    "photopolarimetric observations of comet neat c/2001 q4 were made during the period may - june 2004 with a two channel photopolarimeter @xcite mounted on the 1.2 m telescope of mt .",
    "abu observatory operated by physical research laboratory ( prl ) , ahmedabad .",
    "prl photopolarimeter modulates the polarized component of the incident light at 20hz with a rotating super - achromatic half - wave plate in front of a wollaston prism .",
    "the instrument is equipped with iau s international halley watch ( @xmath13 ) continuum filters ( 3650/80 , 4845/65 , 6840/90  ) @xcite and johnson - cousins @xmath14 broad band filters .",
    "the @xmath13 filters acquired for comet halley have been in regular use for observations of several other comets @xcite .",
    "the filters have been carefully stored in dry atmospheric conditions to preserve their transmission characteristics .",
    "the observations made with the same set of filters facilitate better comparison with other comets observed earlier , hence their continued use . +    [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ pol_color ]      on 20th may 2004 , we made polarimetric observations on the comet at various points tail - ward .",
    "this was done by pointing the telescope ahead of the path of the comet while tracking at the sidereal rate . over a period of 360 seconds",
    "the comet was allowed to drift across the 10  aperture with sampling time of 10sec . during this period ,",
    "the movement of the comet was in a direction parallel to the direction pointed by the tail .",
    "the observations were made using the r - band filter and a running average of 5 measurements of polarization and intensity are plotted in fig .",
    "4 . an aperture of 10 \" corresponds to a linear scale of @xmath15 4000 km at the distance of the comet at that time .",
    "any heterogeneity at scales larger than this should show up in the observed polarization .",
    "we notice a decrease in polarization as the nucleus is approaching , becoming near minimum at the photocenter while showing a systematic , albeit small , increase tail - ward .",
    "similar behaviour was noticed by @xcite for comet 2p / encke , suggesting a change in the mean scattering properties of dust particles on time of flight timescale of one hour- the likely cause of fragmentation being disaggregation of the composite , porous dust particles .",
    "@xcite measured polarization in the coma and tail of comet hale - bopp up to a distance of about 200  and found the polarization to increase and then decrease when going away from the nuclear region . in our case ,",
    "perhaps the duration of observation and linear distance covered were not sufficient enough to notice such variation .",
    "the brightness reaches maximum , as expected , at the photocenter ( nucleus ) and then decreases sharply .",
    "one can infer , broadly , the presence of large compact particles ( aggregates ) near the photocenter while more finer grains and fluffy aggregates tail - ward .",
    "however , too much should not be read in this behaviour as the sampled region ( 4000 km ) is larger than the typical size of the comet nucleus and we might not have sampled the circumnuclear region of lower polarization .",
    "the position angle does not show any appreciable change during the observation .",
    "the variation of polarization as a function of phase angle throws light on various properties of comet such as composition , albedo , size distribution of grains etc .",
    "though there exists large amount of observational data related to polarization at many phase angles , polarization values at lower phases ( negative polarization branch region ) and larger phase angles , including the region where it peaks ( 90 - 105@xmath16 ) are very scanty .",
    "such scarcity of data causes problems for the proper modeling / fitting of the polarization phase curve for the comets .",
    "as mentioned earlier , apparition of comet neat q4 , provided us the opportunity to measure linear polarization covering a good part of the higher phase angle branch of the curve .",
    "these measured values are plotted in the polarization phase curves for the continuum bands 4845   and 6840   in figs .",
    "[ neat_blue ] and [ neat_red ] , respectively along with observed values for other comets taken from the catalog compiled by @xcite .",
    "our observed values are in fairly good agreement with the polarization values obtained for various comets .",
    "a large scatter is evident from the figures , more so in blue continuum towards the larger phase angles . on some nights observations",
    "were made through broad band @xmath14 filters ( mostly with @xmath17-band ) to get better s / n as explained in section 2 .",
    "on may 20 and june 10 , 2004 , observations have been made with both broad and narrow band filters to look for any systematic difference in the polarization behaviour .",
    "we note such a difference in the degree of polarization obtained in two sets of filters which has been applied to the broad band data ( @xmath18 and @xmath17 ) as correction before plotting in fig .",
    "[ neat_blue ] and fig .",
    "[ neat_red ] , respectively . with this correction ,",
    "the observations through @xmath17-band and the @xmath13 6840  band compare well on different nights .",
    "same is true for the @xmath18 and @xmath13 4845  band apart from a slightly larger scatter which may be attributed to the effect of variable molecular emission observed by @xcite almost simultaneously .",
    "the present observations indicate expected behaviour of polarization as a function of phase angle , polarization increasing with phase in the larger phase angle regime . however , phase angles reported here fall short of the phase values for maximal polarization . for comet",
    "c/1996 b2 hyakutake , @xcite report 24% ( blue continuum ) and 26% ( red continuum ) as maximum polarization at @xmath19 94 deg , while @xcite mention a value of 28.6% as maximum polarization in red at @xmath19 91 deg for the same comet .",
    "though our observations do not cover the phase angles of maximal polarization , our projected values ( @xmath20 in the range @xmath21 ) for maximum p are almost similar .",
    "we see that the polarization behaviour of comet neat c/2001 q4 ( figs .",
    "[ neat_blue ] and [ neat_red ] ) is very similar to other high polarization comets , such as comet hyakutake(c/1996 b2 ) , at similar phase angles indicating that their dust grains have similar characteristics .    the grains in comets are identified to be mainly amorphous and crystalline silicates @xcite and chon @xcite particles . in comet",
    "neat c/2001 q4 , mg - rich olivine crystals and mg - rich crystalline pyroxene were detected in ir spectra @xcite .",
    "the mid - ir spectra of comet c/2001 q4 ( neat ) and hale - bopp @xcite show remarkable similarity suggesting the presence of similar silicate minerals in approximately equal relative abundance of sub - micron grains@xcite .",
    "thermal emission models for the 7.7 - 13.1 @xmath10 m sed of comet c/2001 q4 on two epochs may 11.25 ut and may 11.30 ut , 2004 ( just two days prior to our polarimetric observing run ) indicate the dust grains to be highly porous with size distribution peaking at the grain radius of @xmath22 = @xmath23 @xmath10 m @xcite . @xcite",
    "have also reported a drop in silicate - to - amorphous carbon by a factor of @xmath152 in 2 hours .",
    "as far as the dust grain characteristics are concerned , polarization observations corroborate with the finding made with the study of thermal emission spectra . based on the polarization behaviour , the mean grain size of monomer is expected to be in the range 0.2 - 0.3 @xmath10 m .    as discussed in section 3.1 , the polarization color shows significant change during the observing run indicating change in the average grain and aggregate characteristics .",
    "@xcite mention three possibilities for the change in the dust characteristics : i ) grain size decreases due to grain fragmentation leading to higher abundance of smaller grains ; ii ) change in chemical compositions as volatile materials evaporate or are destroyed ; iii ) porosity increases as embedded volatile evaporate .    in the present study ,",
    "polarization color is always red , though it shows significant variation .",
    "one interesting finding is that the change in polarization color is larger in smaller aperture .",
    "in fact the polarization color observed in the two apertures compare well on may 17 and may 19 , but on may 18 it shows significantly lower polarization color and photometric color in the smaller aperture .",
    "this indicates that the comet has been active during this period .",
    "the detection of the change in polarization color may be attributed to the change in the composition of the dust grains rather then the change in particle size .",
    "this work reported optical linear polarization observations on comet neat c/2001 q4 in the phase angle range 86 - 55@xmath6 where there are very few observations . in general , polarization and brightness of the coma increase with wavelength , phase angle and size of the apertures used .",
    "comet neat c/2001 q4 , at these large phase angles , shows similar degree of polarizations as comet hyakutake , indicating similar grain characteristics in two comets .",
    "observations reveal that comet neat q4 exhibits polarimetric behaviour typical to high polarization comets and therefore , should contain substantial number of small dust particles and fluffy aggregates with submicron sized monomers .",
    "as expected , polarimetric colour increases with wavelength and phase angle range of present observations .",
    "the polarization and photometric colours on may 18 indicate some cometary activity , leading to either change in composition due to decomposition of organics or change in grain size .",
