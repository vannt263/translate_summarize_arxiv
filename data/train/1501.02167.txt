    "the first indication that stellar composition plays a role in , and may be affected by , the formation of planets was the enhanced metallicity ( parameterized as [ fe / h]=log(n@xmath1/n@xmath2 ) - log ( n@xmath1/n@xmath2)@xmath3 ) of solar - type exoplanet host stars ( gonzalez 1997 ) . while initially suggested as a sign of accretion of hydrogen - depleted material onto the star , the planet - metallicity correlation is now established as a mostly primordial effect ( e.g. , santos et al.2004 ; fischer & valenti 2005 ) .",
    "recently , the correlation was shown to be dependent on planet mass ( e.g. , sousa et al .",
    "2008 ; ghezzi et al .",
    "2010 ) , being the weakest for terrestrial - sized planets ( e.g. , buchhave et al .",
    "if host star metallicity is considered a proxy for heavy element concentration in the protoplanetary disk , this planet mass dependence seems to support the core accretion process of planet formation , as a larger concentration of heavy elements is needed to form giant planet cores ( @xmath410 m@xmath5 ; ida & lin 2004 ) rapidly enough to allow time for gaseous envelope accretion ( @xmath6100 m@xmath5 ; pollack et al .",
    "1996 ) prior to gas disk dissipation after a few million years ( e.g. , wyatt et al .",
    "is it still possible that planet formation may alter host star composition ?",
    "melndez et al . (",
    "2009 ; m09 ) suggest the sun is deficient by @xmath420% in refractory elements , with condensation temperatures @xmath7 900 k , relative to volatile elements when compared to `` solar twins '' without detected planets .",
    "m09 , as well as studies finding similar results ( e.g. , ramrez et al .",
    "2010 ; gonzalez et al .",
    "2010 ) , interpret the negative [ x / h ] or [ x / fe ] vs t@xmath8 slopes of refractory elements as a star `` missing '' rock - forming material that has been sequestered in terrestrial planets ( chambers 2010 ) .",
    "however , this interpretation has been questioned .",
    "other studies have found no increase of negative slopes in hotter or more metal - rich stars ( ramrez et al.2014 ) ; no difference in slopes between hosts / non - hosts after correcting for galactic chemical evolution ( schuler et al .",
    "2011b ) , correlations between the @xmath9 slope and stellar age and log @xmath10 ( adibekyan et al .",
    "2014 ) ; and even the opposite of expected trends  positive / negative slopes in small / giant planet hosts ( gonzlez hernndez et al.2011 ) . to complicate the picture , stars hosting close - in giant planets may instead accrete refractory - rich material that would have formed small planets ( e.g. , raymond et al . 2011 ; schuler et al 2011b ) .",
    "thus , if / how planet formation influences stellar composition remains uncertain , and is challenging to disentangle from the local or global composition of the disk and the star s position in / motion through the galaxy ( e.g. , nehag et al .",
    "2014 ; schuler et al .",
    "binary host stars provide an opportunity for constraining how planet formation affects host stars , as they likely experience similar environments throughout their evolution ( e.g. , kratter 2011 ) .",
    "desidera et al .",
    "( 2004 ; 2006 ) found that the majority of @xmath450 wide binaries ( not known to host planets ) had @xmath0[fe / h]@xmath110.03 , suggesting larger metallicity differences are exceptional .",
    "gratton et al .",
    "( 2001 ) examined six wide binaries across a larger range of elements , finding that four had identical abundances .",
    "however , two stars were significantly different , with @xmath0[fe / h]=0.053@xmath120.014 and 0.091@xmath120.006 and similar differences for other refractory elements ; the authors suggested these differences were due to pollution by dusty protoplanetary disk or rocky planetary material . radial velocity ( rv ) monitoring of both `` polluted '' systems to search for planets has been inconclusive due to changing stellar activity cycles . within binary systems",
    "known to host planets , the results are also ambiguous : there is not yet consensus on the significance of differences between 16 cyg a and b ( the latter hosts a @xmath42.4 m@xmath13 planet ; schuler et al .",
    "2011a ; ramrez et al.2011 ; tucci maia et al . 2014 ) , and similar studies indicate no abundance differences between stars in a single - host ( hat - p-1 , liu et al .",

    "this system is one of only four known dual - planet - hosting binaries ( xo-2 , hd 20782/1 , kepler-132 , and wasp-94 ) .",
    "here we expand the analysis of teske et al .",

    "the observations and data reduction for xo-2n and -2s are detailed in teske et al .",
    "the @xmath1860,000 , s / n@xmath4170 - 230 data were acquired in february 2012 with the high dispersion spectrograph at the 8.2 m subaru telescope , and reduced using standard techniques with the iraf software package .      the stellar parameter analysis and uncertainty calculations",
    "are also explained in teske et al .",
    "( 2013 ) and listed in table [ tab : stellar_params ] .",
    "the abundances were determined using the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) spectral analysis code moog ( sneden 1973 ) , with model atmospheres interpolated from the kurucz atlas9 nover grids .",
    "equivalent widths were measured with ` splot ' in iraf , and abundances were normalized to solar , derived from a reflected - moonlight spectrum taken with the same configuration during the same run , on a line - by - line basis . in xo-2n , 49 fe i and 8 fe ii lines were measured ; in xo-2s , 49 fe i and 10 fe ii lines were measured ; the line properties and equivalent widths are provided in table [ tab : lines ] .      as shown in recent studies of gaia benchmark stars ( jofre et al .",
    "2014 ) and transiting exoplanet host stars ( e.g. , torres et al . 2012 ) , different analysis methods lead to different stellar parameters and thus different abundances .",
    "to investigate this effect thoroughly , particularly the different t@xmath19s , we explored several alternative methods , used widely in other exoplanet host star studies , for deriving stellar parameters for xo-2n and -2s .",
    "* alternative parameter set 1 * first , we repeated our analysis relative to solar , using by - hand iraf measurements of the lines in ghezzi et al .",
    "this list includes a smaller number of fe i and ii lines ( in our case 23 fe i for n / s , and 9/10 fe ii for n / s ) , but all have lab - measured and thus more reliable gf - values .",
    "kurucz atlas9 odfnew grids were used as input models , though the difference between nover and odfnew are insignificant .",
    "the resulting parameters are listed as `` alt param 1 '' in table [ tab : stellar_params ] .",
    "* alternative parameter set 2 * second , we adopted the full analysis approach of ghezzi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) and derived parameters based on absolute abundances , not relative to solar .",
    "the ghezzi et al .",
    "( 2010 ) line list , with lab - measured gf - values , was compiled specifically for an absolute analysis .",
    "again , the measurements were done by - hand in iraf and the stellar models were odfnew , using the same ews as `` alt param 1 '' .",
    "the resulting parameters , are listed as `` alt param 2 '' in table [ tab : stellar_params ] .",
    "* alternative parameter set 3 * third , we used odfnew models with a different and longer line list of 72/67 fe i and 9/8 fe ii lines for n / s , compiled from sousa et al .",
    "the equivalent widths were measured with ares ( sousa et al .",
    "2007 ) ; lines @xmath200.30 dex from the average in the sun were removed and an interative 2@xmath21 clipping was applied to the stars during the parameter determination .",
    "the resulting parameters are listed as `` alt param 3 '' in table [ tab : stellar_params ] .      in almost every case , within 1@xmath21 total errors",
    "all derived parameter pairs for xo-2n and -2s overlap , indicating the stars are similar , potentially identical , but could also differ by as much as @xmath4200 k in t@xmath19 , @xmath40.25 dex in log @xmath10 , @xmath40.10 in [ fe / h ] , and @xmath40.07 km / s in @xmath22 . in the first three parameter sets ,",

    "interestingly , a higher [ fe / h ] in xo-2n is consistent across all derived parameters ; this also concurs with damasso et al .",
    "( 2015 ) . despite the possibility of the stars having the same [ fe / h ] within errors , the fact that all four parameter sets  found using different lines measurements and analyses techniques  find [ fe / h]@xmath26[fe / h]@xmath27 points towards a real metallicity difference .",
    "we return to this point in  3 .",
    "all abundances were derived directly from equivalent width ( ew ) measurements performed with the ` splot ' task in iraf , except [ o / h ] , which was derived through spectral synthesis in moog .",
    "abundance determinations of fe , ni , c , and o are detailed in teske et al .",
    "( 2013 ) . for elements new to this work , line lists ( table [ tab : lines ] ) were compiled from melndez et al .",

    "the only element besides fe for which we measured two ionization states was titanium .",
    "we removed 1@xmath21 outliers based on the mean and standard deviation of the line - by - line solar - normalized abundances .",
    "this procedure changed the [ ti i / h ] and [ ti ii / h ] values by @xmath110.025 , but reduced the dispersion in the abundances by roughly a factor of two .",
    "bergemann ( 2011 ) found the discrepancy between solar ti i and ii is solved by including non - lte line formation , and suggested that ti ii may be a better [ ti / h ] indicator in solar - type stars .",
    "we tested whether non - lte corrections to ti i lines in xo-2n and -2s , calculated using statistical equilibrium and line formation codes described in bergemann ( 2011 ) and mafags - os models with the same stellar parameters derived here , change the [ ti i / h ] values .",
    "we find these corrections do not significantly alter [ ti i / h ] , but as these are the first non - lte corrections calculated for cool , metal - rich stars , we provide the a(ti i)@xmath28-a(ti i)@xmath29 corrections in table [ tab : lines ] .",
    "we report a total [ ti / h ] based on the lines of both species , with 1@xmath21 outliers removed within each species as described above .",
    "the results of our measurements are in table [ tab : lines ] , including wavelength , @xmath30 , log @xmath31 , ews for each element for the sun , xo-2n , and xo-2s .",

    "xo-2s are in table [ tab : diffs ] .",
    "next we discuss the resulting abundances from the four different parameter sets derived above .",
    "the advantage of studying binary stars is the likelihood that their formation environments were similar , so their compositions ",
    "assuming like xo-2n and -2s they are of similar mass and temperature  should also be similar .",
    "small differences in binary star abundances were previously suggested to be related to planet formation / migration ( e.g. , tucci - maia et al .",
    "2014 ) . to investigate the xo-2 system for such abundance differences , we compare one star directly to the other , @xmath0(xo-2n - xo-2s ) . in figure [ fig2 ]",
    "we show the line - by - line ( n - s ) differences and standard deviations of the differences ( error bars ) for our four parameter sets .",
    "the black asterisks in figure [ fig2 ] represent the largest possible differences between ( n - s ) ",
    "-204 k @xmath0t@xmath19 , 0.27 dex @xmath0log @xmath10 , and 0.11 dex [ fe / h ] . based on these differences , xo-2n may have less refractories than xo-2s , save a few elements  si , fe , and ni .",
    "these `` original '' parameter results also imply xo-2n is enhanced in volatile elements ; the slope for t@xmath34500 k elements is negative ( @xmath351.66e-4 dex / k ) .",
    "however , the abundance differences , and thus slopes , change with different stellar parameters , as suggested in  2 . using a smaller line list , relative - to - solar / absolute results in the blue closed / open triangles in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "these parameters correspond to ( n - s ) differences of -83/-72 k @xmath0t@xmath19 , -0.09/-0.11 dex @xmath0log @xmath10 , and 0.09/0.11 dex [ fe / h ] .",
    "interestingly the relative - to - solar and absolute analyses produce a very similar pattern , indicating that xo-2n is enhanced in most refractory elements and depleted in volatiles .",
    "the red points in figure [ fig2 ] represent abundances represent parameters derived from a longer line list than the `` original '' parameter set , with measurements made with ares , and ( n - s ) differences of 3 k @xmath0t@xmath19 , 0.06 dex @xmath0log @xmath10 , and 0.08 dex [ fe / h ] .",
    "these abundance differences show an even greater enhancement / depletion in xo-2n of refractory / volatile elements versus the abundances marked with blue triangles .",
    "the different @xmath0(n - s ) abundances , and corresponding t@xmath8-slopes , resulting from different stellar parameters make it challenging to conclude whether any of the enhancements / depletions between xo-2n and -2s are real , within the bounds of measurement errors . to investigate how dependent the abundance differences are on @xmath0t@xmath19 and @xmath0log @xmath10 , which change the most between our different analyses",
    ", we used the same ews and three test parameter sets that varied only in @xmath0log @xmath10 .",
    "for these tests , we adopted @xmath0t@xmath19 -130 k ( n - s ) , based on the spread of the points in figure [ fig2 ] ; this @xmath0t@xmath19 is between the @xmath0t@xmath19s of the black asterisks ( -204 k ) and red circles ( 3 k ) .",
    "specifically , the parameters for xo-2n / s were 5390/5520 k , 0.43/0.33 dex [ fe / h ] , and 1.20 km / s for @xmath22 , with log @xmath10 varying between 4.30/4.40 , 4.35/4.35 , and 4.40/4.30 .",
    "the results of changing @xmath0log @xmath10 between xo-2n and -2s are shown in figure [ fig3 ] as blue ( -0.1 dex ) , green ( 0 dex ) , and orange ( 0.1 dex ) stars.changing @xmath0log @xmath10 has a minimal effect on the abundance differences , except for @xmath0(o / h ) , which is known to depend strongly on log @xmath10 . for most elements , the log @xmath10 tests result in @xmath0(n - s ) abundances of @xmath40 , falling somewhere in between the black , blue , and red points from figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "however , in all three tests in figure [ fig3 ] , the abundances of si , fe , and ni are still above the zero difference line .",
    "this is remarkably consistent with all four parameter sets derived in  2 and plotted in figure [ fig2 ] , which all show si , fe , and possibly ni enhancements in xo-2n .",
    "varying many different aspects of the analysis and stellar parameters does not alter this enhancement pattern , providing strong evidence for a real abundance difference in si , fe , and ni between xo-2n and -2s .",

    "( 2011 ) found differences in [ si / fe ] between known host and non - host stars ; robinson et al .",

    "<S> the chemical composition of exoplanet host stars is an important factor in understanding the formation and characteristics of their orbiting planets . </S>",

    "<S> other proposed correlations are thus far less robust , in part due to uncertainty in the chemical history of stars pre- and post - planet formation . binary host stars of similar type present an opportunity to isolate the effects of planets on host star abundances . here </S>",
    "<S> we present a differential elemental abundance analysis of the xo-2 stellar binary , in which both g9 stars host giant planets , one of which is transiting . </S>",
    "<S> building on our previous work , we report 16 elemental abundances and compare the @xmath0(xo-2n  xo - s ) values to elemental condensation temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0(n - s ) values and slopes with condensation temperature resulting from four different pairs of stellar parameters are compared to explore the effects of changing the relative temperature and gravity of the stars . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of the abundance differences between the stars depend on the chosen stellar parameters , but that fe , si , and potentially ni are consistently enhanced in xo-2n regardless of the chosen stellar parameters . </S>",
    "<S> this study emphasizes the power of binary host star abundance analysis for probing the effects of giant planet formation , but also illustrates the potentially large uncertainties in abundance differences and slopes induced by changes in stellar temperature and gravity . </S>"
