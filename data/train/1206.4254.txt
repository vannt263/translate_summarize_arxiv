    "the reason for the introduction of @xmath288 and @xmath289 of the same type as @xmath141 and @xmath140 is that @xmath105 is closed under any @xmath106 , which maps , e.g. , @xmath141 to @xmath290 .",

    "the justification for this choice is that for any orthonormal pair @xmath304 of vectors in @xmath162 @xmath169 is the full subspace of traceless matrices contained in @xmath165 . after choosing w.l.o.g . @xmath305 and @xmath306",

    "now , the matrix @xmath321 applied from the right maps @xmath161 to @xmath161 and @xmath162 to , say , @xmath322 preserving the angles between vectors lying in one of them . as a result , there are four possible cases for the action of @xmath309 @xmath323 a ) and d ) imply @xmath324 and hence @xmath325 and @xmath326 , whereas b ) and c ) mean @xmath327 . therefore ,",
    "in the latter case the intersection of @xmath161 and @xmath322 is the @xmath316-axis .",
    "since it has to be mapped by @xmath309 to the intersection of @xmath161 and @xmath162 , which is likewise the @xmath316-axis , @xmath316 must be an eigenvector of @xmath309 .",
    "then , it follows that @xmath309 has a unitary action in the @xmath328-@xmath329-plane .",
    "hence , b ) corresponds to @xmath330 , and therefore @xmath331 ,  @xmath332 .",
    "last , in c ) double application of @xmath309 would map @xmath333 , wherefore @xmath334 has to carry out a reflection of @xmath162 on the @xmath161-plane , i.e. , @xmath331 and @xmath335 .",
    "we thus obtain either @xmath331 and @xmath332 or @xmath325 and @xmath336 and conclude that @xmath337 .    the requirement that @xmath21 maps @xmath161 to @xmath161 or @xmath162 and @xmath162 to @xmath161 or @xmath162 also holds for @xmath338 , from which we deduce that @xmath309 must contain only one non - vanishing entry per row and column ( with magnitude 1 ) .",

    "<S> theorem 1 can be used numerically to determine , whether a given mps has lrle , since it imposes conditions on the matrices @xmath27 , which can be represented by a set of polynomial equations : the entries of @xmath27 will give rise to the coefficients of those equations , whereas all other quantities introduced below will constitute their variables to be determined numerically . </S>",
    "<S> the first variables to be introduced are orthonormal basis vectors @xmath115 of @xmath105 , where @xmath116 is the dimension of @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> condition i is equivalent to requiring that any basis vector @xmath117 of @xmath105 is mapped by any @xmath106 into @xmath105 , i.e. , for all @xmath118 @xmath119 constituting the last of the set of equations to to be solved . generally , a set @xmath120 of @xmath121 polynomial equations ( @xmath122 ) with @xmath123 variables @xmath124 can be solved by means of a grbner basis @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a grbner basis @xmath125 is a special basis in the vector space of functions involving the variables @xmath124 : it has the property that the set of equations to be solved is equivalent to the set @xmath126 ( @xmath122 ) , which , in contrast , can be solved by back - substitution while having to deal with the solution of polynomials involving only one variable at a time . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , one of the new equations might involve only @xmath127 . after solving it numerically the result </S>",
    "<S> can be inserted into another equation involving , e.g. , only @xmath127 and @xmath128 etc . </S>",

    "<S> gaussian elimination ) . a grbner basis can be found systematically by use of buchberger s </S>",
    "<S> algorithm @xcite , which is doubly exponential in the complexity of the set of equations to be solved . in our case </S>",
    "<S> , this implies a computational cost that is doubly exponential in the square of the bond dimension . </S>",
    "<S> however , @xmath2 is a constant and in particular independent of the length of the spin chain . if a simultaneous solution to to is found , the mps has lrle . </S>",
    "<S> if even for @xmath129 no solution is found , it does not .    </S>",
    "<S> we now employ theorem 1 analytically to determine the complete sets of mps with lrle for @xmath4 and @xmath5 . in the former case </S>",
    "<S> , we will reproduce the finding that the matrices need to be proportional to unitaries . in the latter , </S>",
    "<S> we obtain the result that matrices of the type of example 2 are the only non - trivial matrices which give rise to lrle .    in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we take @xmath105 to be equal to its adjoint , i.e. , it has to contain the matrices @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 . for @xmath4 </S>",

    "<S> we consider first the case of @xmath138 . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath139 , whereas tracelessness of @xmath140 and @xmath141 implies @xmath142 and @xmath143 , respectively ( the latter will be taken equal to 1 in the following ) . </S>",
    "<S> it follows that @xmath144 . if w.l.o.g . </S>",
    "<S> we set @xmath145 and @xmath146 , we observe that we retrieve the case of @xmath4 , as @xmath147 where @xmath148 is proportional to a unitary , and @xmath149 and @xmath150 are arbitrary . if @xmath105 is of larger dimension , there are other matrices @xmath151 , @xmath152 and @xmath153 ( e.g. , @xmath154 with @xmath155 etc . ) , which do not span the same space as @xmath156 and @xmath132 . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath157 and take @xmath158 and @xmath159 as orthonormal ( which is possible due to @xmath160 ) . since @xmath161 and @xmath162 intersect , we can assume the intersection to be w.l.o.g . </S>",

    "<S> consequently , @xmath105 is at least of dimension 6 . in the case of @xmath171 </S>",
    "<S> it is simple to construct the orthogonal complement of @xmath105 , which is @xmath172 , where @xmath173 and @xmath174 are the normal vectors of @xmath161 and @xmath162 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> this structure of @xmath175 uniquely defines @xmath161 and @xmath162 and vice versa . therefore , </S>",
    "<S> another @xmath176 would not be consistent with this @xmath175 , and the only possibility would be @xmath177 corresponding to @xmath137 ( i.e. , @xmath178 ) . </S>",
    "<S> thus , @xmath179 is the only remaining case which might lead to a non - trivial mps . in this case there </S>",
    "<S> exist the two subspaces @xmath161 and @xmath162 of the afore - mentioned type . based on their properties an ansatz for @xmath21 </S>",

    "<S> we have shown that lrle can be detected by placing qubits at the ends of the chain . </S>",
    "<S> based on that we were able to derive a theorem according to which it can be checked directly from the matrices of the mps , whether it possesses lrle . </S>",
    "<S> how this can been done in practice has been indicated by eqs . - , which is a polynomial set of equations that can be solved numerically in a systematic manner . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , we provided non - trivial examples of mps , for which those equations have a simultaneous solution , determining the full sets of mps with lrle for @xmath4 and @xmath5 .    </S>",
