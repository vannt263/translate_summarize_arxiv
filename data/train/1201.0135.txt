    "the production of cosmic strings in symmetry breaking phase transitions during the evolution of the early universe is predicted by a wide class of particle physics models @xcite .",
    "the considerable attention attracted by this class of topological defects was motivated by the fact that the cosmic strings are candidates for the generation of a variety of interesting physical effects .",
    "the latter include gravitational lensing , anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background radiation , the generation of gravitational waves , high - energy cosmic rays , and gamma ray bursts .",
    "more recently it has been shown that cosmic strings form in brane inflation models as a by product of the annihilation of the branes ( for a review see @xcite ) .    in quantum field theory , the non - trivial topology of space around a cosmic string results in the distortion of the vacuum fluctuations of quantized fields .",
    "this induces non - zero vacuum expectation values for physical observables such as the field squared and the energy - momentum tensor . in a previous paper @xcite",
    ", we have shown that the distortion of the vacuum fluctuations spectrum by the cosmic string also gives rise to casimir - polder forces acting on a polarizable microparticle ( see also bard10 for the force in the static limit ) .",
    "these forces have attracted a great deal of attention because of their important role in many areas of science , including material sciences , physical chemistry , nanotechnology , and atom optics ( for reviews see @xcite ) . in @xcite it has been shown that , in dependence on the eigenvalues for the polarizability tensor and of the orientation of its principal axes , the casimir - polder force induced by the string can be either repulsive or attractive . for an isotropic polarizability tensor",
    "the force is always repulsive .",
    "another source for the vacuum polarization is the presence of material boundaries .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on a quantum field alter the zero - point oscillations spectrum and lead to additional shifts in the vacuum expectation values .",
    "combined effects of topology and boundaries on the quantum vacuum in the geometry of a cosmic string have been investigated previously for scalar @xcite , electromagnetic @xcite and fermionic fields @xcite , constrained on a cylindrical boundary coaxial with the cosmic string .",
    "the analysis of the vacuum energy for massless scalar fields subject to dirichlet , neumann and hybrid boundary conditions in the setting of the conical piston has been recently developed in @xcite .",
    "the vacuum polarization effects in a cosmic string spacetime induced by a scalar field obeying dirichlet or neumann boundary conditions on a surface orthogonal to the string are considered in beze11 .    in the present paper",
    "we derive the exact casimir - polder ( cp ) potential for the general case of frequency dependent anisotropic polarizability of a microparticle in the geometry of straight cosmic string with a coaxial conducting cylindrical shell . from the point of view of the physics in the region outside the string",
    ", this geometry can be considered as a simplified model for the nontrivial core .",
    "this model presents a framework in which the influence of the finite core effects on physical processes in the vicinity of the cosmic string can be investigated .",
    "the corresponding results may shed light upon features of finite core effects in more realistic models .",
    "in addition , the problem considered here is of interest as an example with combined topological and boundary - induced quantum effects in which the cp forces can be found in closed form .",
    "the cp interaction potential of a microparticle with an ideal metal cylindrical shell in background of minkowski spacetime has been investigated in a number of papers , in particular , related to applications to carbon nanotubes ( see , for instance , @xcite-@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "recently , the exact potential for a microparticle outside a cylindrical shell has been found in @xcite using the hamiltonian approach .",
    "the cp potential for both regions inside and outside an ideal metal cylindrical shell is investigated in @xcite using the green function method . in this paper",
    "the exact quantum field theoretical result is compared with that obtained using the proximity force approximation and a very good agreement is demonstrated . in @xcite",
    "it was shown that for a particle out of thermal equilibrium with its environment inside a cylindrical cavity the cp potential can be enhanced by fine - tuning the cavity radius to resonate with the particle s internal transition wavelength .",
    "we have organized the paper as follows . in the next section",
    "we evaluate the green tensor in the frequency domain in the region inside a conducting cylindrical shell in the geometry of a cosmic string . by using the generalized abel - plana summation formula ,",
    "the green tensor is decomposed into the boundary - free and boundary - induced parts .",
    "the corresponding cp potential is investigated in section [ sec : cpin ] for the general case of anisotropic polarizability .",

    "<S> the latter dominates for points near the shell , whereas the pure string part is dominant near the string and at large distances from the shell . for the isotropic case and in the region inside the shell the both pure string and shell - induced parts in the casimir - polder force are repulsive with respect to the string . in the exterior region the shell - induced part of the force is directed toward the cylinder whereas the pure string part remains repulsive with respect to the string . at large distances from the shell </S>",
