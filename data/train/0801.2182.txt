    "in order to understand the main processes that take place during the growth of thin films and multilayers , it is important to study the initial steps of those processes , i. e. the submonolayer regime .",
    "the current belief is that insight derived from the combination of experiment and modeling can lead to better control of nanostructures formed during deposition .",
    "consequently , models of submonolayer growth and coarsening with several types of interactions between the adparticles were intensively studied in the last decades - for a recent review with applications to homoepitaxial growth , see ref .",
    "non - equilibrium statistical models are particularly useful for modeling real systems that are confined to long - life metastable states while some atomic processes take place in next - to - equilibrium conditions with the environment .    the recent advances on the production of elongated structures ( e. g. nanowires ) along step edges of vicinal surfaces @xcite and other highly anisotropic growth processes motivated the study of models that produce effectively one - dimensional structures on surfaces under certain conditions @xcite .",
    "however , in many cases it is advantageous to restrict the processes of particle diffusion and attachment / detachment from islands ( possibly competing with the continuous atom deposition ) to one spatial dimension , since it enables a more detailed study of the effects of different physico - chemical parameters .",
    "one of the interesting problems in this field is to determine the island size distributions under different growth conditions .",
    "for instance , recent works have debated the mechanisms responsible for the onset of monomodal or monotonically decreasing distributions in submonolayer growth on vicinal surfaces , since both types of distribution were already observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the peaked island size distributions are the most frequently observed in growth on planar surfaces @xcite and also appear in some effectively one - dimensional systems @xcite . in theoretical models ,",
    "this feature is observed when some critical island size is assumed , above which there is no further atom detachment .",
    "this occurs both for deposition competing with diffusion and for post - deposition coarsening . on the other hand , statistical equilibrium models , where reversibility of attachment and detachment from islands is implicitly assumed ,",
    "provide monotonically decreasing size distributions in one dimension ( more precisely , exponentially decreasing ones ) @xcite .",
    "the simplest reversible non - equilibrium models consider the processes illustrated in fig .",
    "1a in its one - dimensional version ( after deposition has stopped , i. e. with conserved mass ) @xcite .",
    "they account for particle diffusion , aggregation and detachment from islands , with no critical island size . for simplicity",
    ", it is assumed that attachment occurs immediately upon contact of a diffusing particle with a cluster , while the detachment occurs with rate @xmath7 , where @xmath1 is the mass of the cluster from which the particle leaves .",
    "previous work in one - dimension only considered the case of constant @xmath0 for all islands ( @xmath16 ) @xcite , where the steady state presents monotonically decreasing cluster size distributions , similarly to the equilibrium models @xcite . the great applicability of the two - dimensional versions of these models explains the small number of studies of the one - dimensional cases .    in this paper , we will consider this class of non - equilibrium one - dimensional models with detachment rates @xmath7 increasing with the mass @xmath1 of the cluster where the particle is attached .",
    "such dependence is certainly expected in heteroepitaxial growth if small lattice mismatches between the adlayer and the substrate are unfavourable to aggregation of new particles to existing islands .",
    "indeed , the drastic consequences of this feature on island shapes was already illustrated in some systems , such as @xmath17 islands on @xmath18 , where a transition from compact to ramified shapes takes place as the coverage increases @xcite . in one - dimensional systems ,",
    "lattice mismatch is also expected to play a role , although at first approximation the shape effects are not present and the island mass is sufficient to determine the rate for detachment of a bordering atom .",
    "the association of a detachment rate with the island size may also be viewed as an alternative to describe the effects of long - range repulsive interactions present in a large number of real systems @xcite , but which are usually very hard for computation .",
    "the models considered here are equivalent to zero - range processes and do have a factorisable steady state @xcite .",
    "this feature means that the exact calculation of the steady state properties may be carried out with the use of an independent interval `` approximation '' ( iia ) to the master equation , which implicitly assumes a factorization of probabilities .",
    "the iia , which has already proved to be an exceptional tool to investigate nonequilibrium statistical models @xcite , here provides exact results for some forms of @xmath19 , which are confirmed by numerical simulation data .",
    "however , in many cases the latter approach is essential to calculate steady state properties , particularly when average cluster sizes are small and discretization effects play an important role .",
    "we will show that both monomodal and monotonically decreasing cluster size distributions may be obtained in these models depending on the particular form of detachment rate and the coverage . in the analysis of some forms of @xmath19 which account for short - range attraction of neighboring atoms ( via detachment rates much smaller than isolated particle diffusion coefficients )",
    ", we will show that it is possible to exchange between those shapes by tuning the temperature or changing the coverage - high temperature and low coverage typically favoring the monotonically decreasing form .",
    "although no quantitative comparison with real systems data will be shown here , we believe that the relative simplicity of our model and the range of qualitative behaviors obtained from it can motivate its use in particular applications . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", this work opens the possibility of new applications of the widely studied zero - range processes .",
    "the rest of this work is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the column picture in which the original problem ( fig .",
    "1 ) is mapped , the general form of the master equation in the iia and the method of solution in the steady state . in sec .",
    "iii we present the steady state cluster size distributions for selected forms of detachment rates and compare them with results of numerical simulations .",
    "we focus on the differences between limiting cases of rapidly and slowly increasing @xmath19 . in sec .",
    "iv , we consider systems where formation of small islands is favoured by detachment rates significantly smaller than isolated atom ( @xmath20 ) diffusion , while @xmath19 is increasing .",
    "this mimics the competition between short - range attractive and long - range repulsive interactions , a case which may be especially relevant for surface science . in sec .",
    "v we summarize our results and conclusions and discuss possible applications .",
    "as shown in fig . 1a ,",
    "the main processes in our problem are : ( i ) random walk of separated ( single ) particle , at a rate @xmath21 ; ( ii ) detachment of particle from edge of cluster by particle stepping one unit away from it , at a rate @xmath19 , where @xmath1 is the cluster mass .",
    "in addition , there is ( iii ) attachment of particle to edge of cluster , occurring immediately after the particle jumps to that position .",
    "the model defined in this so - called cluster picture can also be depicted in a column picture , as illustrated in fig .",
    "1b . in the latter ,",
    "the clusters are columns , and the group of @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) vacant sites between two adjacent clusters has become a group of @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) empty columns between two filled columns .",
    "thus , one of the vacancies of the cluster picture now acts as a column spacer , and the remaining ones have become columns with @xmath26 particles .",
    "this column picture corresponds to a zero - range process @xcite .",
    "indeed the mapping just demonstrated achieves the equivalent of the inverse of a mapping from a zero - range process to an exclusion process by other means @xcite . in traffic flow models , such as that in ref .",
    "@xcite , different rates for jumps to the left and to the right must be considered .",
    "the full analytic description of systems with such stochastic processes is provided by the master equation , which is most easily written in the column picture .",
    "the description is simplified by the fact that the process conserves the total particle numbers @xmath27 .",
    "thus , using periodic boundary conditions and a total number of sites @xmath28 ( lattice length in the cluster picture ) , and denoting by @xmath29 the total number of clusters of size @xmath1 ( @xmath23 ) , it follows that ( i ) @xmath30 , ( ii ) the number of spacers is @xmath31 , and ( iii ) @xmath29 equals the number of columns of size @xmath1 , for @xmath32 .",
    "hence , denoting by @xmath33 the number of columns of size zero , we have @xmath34 ( the last step defining the density @xmath11 in the original picture ) .",
    "thus the total number of columns ( including those of size zero ) is constant , as is the density .",
    "the system configuration can be specified by the ordered set of numbers of particles in each of the columns in succession : @xmath35 .",
    "the probability @xmath36 at time @xmath37 of the configuration @xmath38 changes by in and out processes .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "1c shows the process @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) having rate @xmath41 .",

    ", one can attempt to find a solution of the master equation using for @xmath47 the factorised form @xmath48 .",
    "this turns out to give an approximate form ( the iia ) for the time - dependent situation , but an exact result for the steady state ( the time evolution may be particularly interesting in the case of rates decreasing with cluster mass , and is the subject of our current work )",
    ". in the special case of homogeneous rates ( @xmath0 independent of column position @xmath49 ) the steady state master equation is solved exactly with the function @xmath50 , i. e. independent of @xmath37 and @xmath49 . here",

    "1a ) .    the reduced form of the steady state master equation applying in this simplified ( homogeneous ) situation can be obtained from eq .",
    "( [ mastergeral ] ) or directly as follows from the processes involved in the evolution of @xmath51 . in an appropriately defined time step ,",

    "the steady state properties to be discussed here are the cluster size distributions and the average cluster sizes .",

    "( [ mmediogeral ] ) , which also took into account columns with zero mass .",

    ", we will refer to that original picture in the following .",
    "the simulations were typically performed in lattices of sizes @xmath87 , with several densities and different forms of @xmath19 . due to the small cluster sizes imposed by the system dynamics , in all cases finite - size effects are negligible ( this was checked by comparison of results in different lattice sizes ) .",
    "the generation of a sequence of configurations begins with the deposition of a random layer of density @xmath11 .",
    "subsequently , the dynamics with diffusion , attachment and detachment processes is allowed , and the evolution of the cluster size distribution is monitored . typically , it is assumed that the steady state is attained if no appreciable change ( e. g. @xmath88 in the peak ) is found in the distribution at the last time decade of the simulation , after averaging over at least 100 initial configurations ( i. e. 100 different sequences ) . under these conditions ,",
    "the representative configurations are attained , on the average , after @xmath89 detachments of particles aggregated to small clusters .",
    "anyway , it is important to note that in our models steady state properties are independent of the initial system configuration , thus the same results would be obtained if diffusion and detachment processes were competing with deposition during the production of the first configuration with the desired density @xmath11 ( however , there are special models where steady state properties depend on the initial configuration - see e. g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "first we consider the case ( i ) of constant detachment rate , @xmath90 for @xmath3 and isolated particle hopping rate @xmath91 .",
    "the analysis proceeding from eqs .",
    "( [ rhomu ] ) and ( [ psolucao ] ) gives a size distribution which is exponentially decreasing in @xmath1 for @xmath3 .",

    "such results were formerly predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite and numerically confirmed in ref .",
    "these distributions are equivalent to those obtained in equilibrium ( reversible ) models with nearest neighbor interactions between the adatoms @xcite .",
    "now we consider the power law case ( ii ) , @xmath95 for @xmath59 , in which the reduction of the analytic result ( [ psolucao ] ) for @xmath51 is less straightforward than in the previous case .",
    "for this reason , most results are obtained from simulation . in fig .",

    "are predominant and the distribution is rapidly decreasing , so that it seems to decay faster than a simple exponential for @xmath100 . as the coverage increases , it crosses over to a peaked ( monomodal ) distribution , which becomes very sharp for @xmath11 close to @xmath74 .",
    "this crossover is directly related to the increase in the average size @xmath101 , from a value near unity for small @xmath11 ( where the decrease is monotonic ) to large values for large @xmath11 ( where the peak is close to @xmath102 ) .",

    "we next consider another simple detachment rate function , @xmath108 for @xmath59 , hereafter called case ( iii ) .",

    "we remark here that the case @xmath115 is marginal : from the discussion at the end of sec .",

    "@xcite ) , the infinite system achieves a steady state if @xmath116 but not if @xmath117 .    in fig .",
    "3 we show the scaled cluster size distributions for case ( iii ) obtained from simulation , with @xmath112 and coverages @xmath97 and @xmath118 . both show excellent agreement with the analytical results ( hereafter represented by solid curves in the plots ) . again we observe that the distribution is monotonically decreasing for small coverages , where @xmath14 is close to @xmath74 , while for larger coverages there appears a peak .",
    "however , there is an important difference from case ( ii ) here : instead of having a sharp peak close to @xmath14 , the distribution for large coverages has a very fat left tail and the most probable island size may be smaller than @xmath119 ( see data for @xmath118 in fig .",
    "this difference is certainly a consequence of the slower increase of the detachment rate with the cluster mass .",
    "we also analyzed other forms of detachment rates , namely simple exponential , logarithmic @xmath19 , and the particular logarithmic case @xmath120 } ^{\\left [ 1+\\ln{\\left ( m+1\\right)}\\right]}$ ] , for which a closed analytical form of @xmath51 can be obtained . in all cases ,",
    "the analytically predicted distributions agree very well with simulation data .",
    "with the logarithmic forms , the qualitative behavior is intermediate between cases ( ii ) and ( iii ) above .",
    "the peaked cluster size distributions shown above were always obtained for large densities . at first sight , this condition seems to be unattainable in experiments on submonolayers on vicinal surfaces , since the one - dimensional character of the adlayer ( e. g. chain - like structures along the step edges ) is lost at high coverages .",

    "iv , we will show that under certain realistic conditions on @xmath19 , it is also possible to observe peaked distributions for densities lower than @xmath121 .",
    "moreover , it is important to stress that the density @xmath11 of particles along the steps can be much larger than the nominal coverage @xmath122 of the surface because the latter is an adatom density per substrate area , while @xmath11 is the filling of one - dimensional rows . as an example",

    "that factor significantly reduces the mobility of aggregated atoms when compared to the isolated ones . on the other hand , the mass dependence of @xmath0 accounts for the effects of the interactions with the substrate , which works against the increase of cluster size ( e. g. effects of lattice mismatch or substrate - mediated repulsive interactions ) .",
    "we will typically work with @xmath128 for each form of @xmath19 , in order to show the possible effects of the temperature in the island size distributions .",

    "indeed , these models are equivalent to zero - range processes in which the system attains a steady state .",
    "an independent interval `` approximation '' to the master equation was proposed in order to calculate the cluster size distribution which actually provides an exact description in the steady state .",
    "the tools necessary for derivation of explicit distributions for any particular form of @xmath19 were provided and results for a variety of cases were presented and compared with numerical simulation data .",
    "the representative rate functions analyzed above include some which arise from associating ( arrhenius ) detachment rates with potentials @xmath162 for particles at the end of a cluster of size @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath162 is then a sum , from @xmath163 to @xmath164 , of pair potentials @xmath165 for separation @xmath49 .",
    "the forms @xmath166 vanishing , @xmath166 coulomb - like and inverse square then give ( exactly in the first two cases , and for large @xmath1 in the third one ) the detachment rate functions of cases ( i ) , ( ii ) , ( iii ) , respectively .",
    "in addition , we also mimicked the presence of short - range attraction in the models where the detachment rates were smaller than isolated particle hopping rates by an overall factor @xmath2 .",
    "one of the important conclusions of this work is the possibility of changing the shape of island size distributions , from monomodal to monotonically decreasing ones , by tuning the temperature or changing the coverage . for different forms of detachment rates ( rapidly or slowly decreasing with @xmath1 )",
    ", it was shown that high temperatures and low coverages are favourable for the onset of the monotonically decreasing distributions , their combined effect being described by the scaling variable @xmath167 .",
    "this transition is not usual in non - equilibrium modeling of submonolayer growth , particularly when irreversible attachment to islands ( i. e. a critical island size ) is assumed .",
    "however , it is an important finding because both shapes of distribution were already observed ( isolated ) in island growth near step edges of vicinal surfaces @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "rapidly or slowly increasing @xmath19 have different effects on the position of the peak of the island size distributions and on its right tail . rapidly increasing @xmath19 [ e. g. case ( ii ) above ] lead to peaks very close to @xmath14 and rapidly decreasing tails , since formation of large clusters is very difficult",
    ". however , the slowly decreasing @xmath19 forms [ e. g. case ( iii ) , where @xmath19 does not diverge when @xmath109 ] provide peaks close to @xmath15 and fat right tails . in real systems where island size distributions are measured , these results may give clues on how intense are the mechanisms that work against the formation of large clusters .",
    "despite the fact that no application to a particular real system was proposed here , we believe that the framework developed in this paper may be useful for such applications .",
    "long range interactions frequently play a role in submonolayer growth but introduce difficulties to both analytical ( scaling ) and numerical calculations , even when they are limited to one dimension ( see . e.",
    "g. @xcite ) .",
    "consequently , the inclusion of simpler mechanisms in a model system may be useful , such as the association of detachment rates to the full cluster size suggested here .",
    "the fact that our model corresponds to a zero - range process allows for much simpler analytical calculations of steady state properties , in contrast to other ( not less important ) approaches , such as the introduction of energy barriers for particle attachment to clusters @xcite .",
    "finally , it is also interesting to recall that gas adsorption in carbon nanotubes may be viewed as a one - dimensional clustering problem , thus it is another field where this type of non - equilibrium model may find application . indeed ,",
    "simple statistical equilibrium models of interacting particles in finite lattices were already proposed for those systems @xcite .",
