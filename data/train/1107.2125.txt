    "we have also proved the inverse problem , namely , every spin - chain of the random environment can be surrounded by an environment so that it will be the solution in the ground state . in the work",
    "all the necessary numerical data were obtained by way of large number of parallel simulations of the auxiliary problem in order to construct all the statistical parameters of 3@xmath0 spin glass at the limit of ergodicity of 1@xmath0 sscs nonideal ensemble .",
    "as numerical simulations show , the distributions of all statistical parameters become stable after @xmath160 independent calculations which are realized in parallel . the idea of 1@xmath0 spin - chains parallel simulations , based on this simple and clear logic , greatly simplifies the calculations of 3@xmath0 spin glasses which are still considered as a subset of difficult simulation problems .",
    "let us note that computation of spin - spin interactions distribution function from the first principals of the classical mechanics is very important result of this work .",
    "as analysis show , the distribution is not an analytic function .",
    "it is from the class of lvy functions which does not have variance @xmath161 and mean value @xmath162 .    despite the absence of calculations by other methods , it is obvious that the developed scheme of calculations should differ from other algorithms , including the algorithms which are based on monte carlo simulation method @xcite , by the accuracy and efficiency .",
    "we were once again convinced in the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm after analyzing the results of different numerical experiments by modeling the statistical parameters of 3@xmath0 spin - glass system which are presented in figures 5 a , b and 6 .    in the work a new way of partition function",
    "construction ( configuration integral ) is proposed in the form of one - dimensional integral of the energy distribution , which unlike the usual definitions does not include physically unrealizable spin - chains configurations ( see difference of free energy derivatives on fig .",
    "it is obvious that the new definition of partition function is more correct and in addition it is very simple for computation .",
    "finally , the developed method can be generalized for the cases of external fields which will allow us investigate a large number of dynamical problems including critical properties of 3@xmath0 classical spin glasses .",
