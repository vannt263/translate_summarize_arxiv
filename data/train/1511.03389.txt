    "the group of a virtual knot was introduced by kauffman in @xcite as a generalization of the wirtinger presentation of the fundamental group of a classical knot complement . an important question in such category is to determine when a group @xmath1 is the group of a virtual knot diagram .",
    "several conditions have been given on group presentations , see @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , but all of them depend on whether we can or can not get a cyclic wirtinger presentation of deficiency @xmath2 or @xmath3 , for @xmath1 .",
    "a _ wirtinger presentation _ of @xmath1 is a presentation of the form    @xmath4 ,    where each @xmath5 , for some @xmath6  and @xmath7  are words in the free group @xmath8 , not necessarily different in @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , a wirtinger presentation is called _ cyclic _ if we have that @xmath9 , for each @xmath10 .",
    "the _ deficiency _ of a presentation @xmath11 is defined as @xmath12 .",
    "more generally _ the deficiency _ of a group @xmath1 , denoted by @xmath13 , is the maximum among the deficiency of its presentations .    in @xcite rodrguez and",
    "toro proved that the group of a @xmath14 bridge virtual knot , has a cyclic wirtinger presentation of deficiency @xmath2 or @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we will provide an algorithm to construct , from a cyclic wirtinger presentation of deficiency @xmath2 or @xmath3 , a virtual knot diagram .",
    "such algorithm uses the definition of combinatorial knots , see @xcite .",
    "baumslag - solitar groups constitute an important family of counterexamples in combinatorial group theory , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they were first introduced by baumslag and solitar in @xcite , in order to get no - hopfian one - relator group presentations .",
    "furthermore , they are given by the following general presentation form    @xmath15    where @xmath16 and @xmath14 are non zero integer numbers .",
    "among many properties of these groups , we have those of being residually finite and hopfian under some restrictions .",
    "that is summarized in the following theorem .",
    "the proof of the statements can be found in @xcite and @xcite respectively .",

    "we give necessary conditions on a group presentation of the form @xmath23 to be a virtual knot group .",
    "these conditions do not depend on the wirtinger presentation form . although these conditions are not enough , we can determine , by using them , when a baumslag - solitar group is the group of a @xmath0 bridge virtual knot , moreover we prove that any of those groups ca nt be the group of a @xmath0 bridge classical knot .    this paper is organized as follows . in section",

    "even though , it is well known that the group of a classical knot has deficiency 1 , we give a combinatorial proof of that fact for the case of two bridge knots and we relate that to conditions on baumslag - solitar groups to show that they are not two bridge classical knot groups .",
    "also , we give a short introduction on fox s derivations to classify the center of baumslag - solitar groups to conclude that none of them correspond to torus knot groups . a more general proof of the fact that no baumslag - solitar groups can not be the group of a classical knot",

    "a _ virtual knot diagram _ @xmath28 on @xmath29 is an oriented @xmath30valent planar connected graph , whose crossings are classified according to figure [ f1]-@xmath31 .",
    "an example of a virtual knot diagram is shown in figure [ f1]-@xmath32 .",
    "note that the positive and negative crossings have the visual effect of passing over and under the diagram .",
    "that does nt happen with virtual crossings .",
    "+ positive and negative crossings are called _",
    "classical crossings_.    two virtual knot diagrams @xmath28 and @xmath33 are said to be _ virtually equivalent _ if one of them can be changed into the other by using a finite number of extended reidemeister moves described in figure 2 .",
    "a _ virtual knot _ is an equivalence class of virtual knot diagrams .",
    "a virtual knot diagram @xmath28 is called _ classical knot diagram _ if @xmath28 does not have virtual crossings .",
    "a virtual knot is called _ classical knot _ if its equivalence class has classical knot diagrams .    in @xcite goussarov , polyak and",
    "viro showed that the category of classical knots is contained in the virtual knots category .",
    "kauffman ( see@xcite ) gave examples of virtual knots that are not equivalent to classical knots . in this sense virtual knot theory becomes a non trivial extension of classical knot theory .",
    "the concept of combinatorial knots , was introduced by m. toro in @xcite , as equivalence classes of lists of the form @xmath34 , where @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "those lists are called _ knot codes_. the _ trivial knot code _ is the empty knot code @xmath40 .",
    "the process of how to assign a knot code to a virtual knot diagram is illustrated with the following example .",
    "let @xmath28 be the virtual knot diagram shown in figure [ figura6 ] .",
    "we label its classical crossings with positive numbers and we choose @xmath41 over @xmath28 , not a crossing point .",
    "we start from @xmath41 at @xmath28 and write down the list of crossing labels we meet , with the convention that if we pass through an under crossing @xmath42 , we add @xmath43 to the list , but if we pass through an over crossing @xmath42 , we add @xmath42 . the resulting finite sequence is called a _ crossing list _ of @xmath28 . for our example , the crossing list is @xmath44 .",
    "we construct also the list @xmath45 , where , @xmath46 if @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a positive crossing or @xmath49 if @xmath47 and @xmath48 is a negative crossing , according to the classification given in figure 1(a ) .",
    "this list is called a _ list of signs _ of @xmath28 , for our example the list of signs is @xmath50 .",
    "hence , the pair @xmath51 is a knot code of @xmath28 .    in the previous example we used @xmath52 as the labeling set of the classical crossings of @xmath28",
    "we can use any list of integers for labeling the classical crossings of the diagram , in that case the crossing list is generated in the same way , but we have to take care about the list of signs , because its length will be the maximum of the numbers used .",
    "if we use the numbers @xmath3 , @xmath0, ... ,@xmath14 for labeling the classical crossing of virtual knot diagrams , then we say that the knot code is in _ standard form_.    for a virtual knot diagram @xmath28 , we will use the same letter @xmath28 to denote a knot code constructed by using the method above .",
    "the notation @xmath53 $ ] will represent the class of @xmath28 and it is called the combinatorial knot associated to @xmath28 .",
    "the concept of a combinatorial knot is related to that of a virtual knot .",
    "the specific relation is given in the following theorem , whose proof can be found in @xcite .    there exists a biunivocal correspondence between combinatorial knots and virtual knots .",
    "it is also possible to relate a knot code with classical knots .",
    "a knot code @xmath28 is said to be * geometric * if there exists a classical knot diagram @xmath28 such that @xmath28 is a knot code for it .",
    "a combinatorial knot @xmath53 $ ] is * classical * if it has a geometric knot code .    due to the biunivocal correspondence between combinatorial and virtual knots , from now on",
    ", we will not make difference between them as we will use knot code and virtual knot diagram indistinctively .",
    "in this section we explain how to construct the group of a virtual knot and we describe some of its properties , the definitions and statements that are not proven here , can be found in @xcite .    in the literature , there exists a more general definition for this group . here",
    "we present one , based on what we will soon call the standard normal form of a diagram .",
    "let @xmath28 be a virtual knot diagram representative with @xmath14 classical crossings .",
    "we can choose a point over the knot such that the first crossing in the path starting at it is an under crossing , and label that crossing @xmath3 .",
    "continue the way along the diagram until you cross it under another crossing , name it @xmath0 . following this way , all the @xmath14 crossings will be labeled .",
    "it is easy to see that the associated knot code to the diagram @xmath28 , can be written as @xmath54 , where the sublists @xmath55 form a partition of the labeling set .",
    "such knot code is called _ standard normal form_.    we define the arcs of @xmath28 as the sublists @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
