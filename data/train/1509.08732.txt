    "the study of the effects of solar flares ( whitten & poppoff , 1965 ; mitra et al . , 1972 ; grubor et al . , 2005 ; xion et al . , 2005 ; palit et al . ,",
    "2013 ) and other extra - terrestrial high energy phenomena such as gamma ray bursts ( grbs ) and soft gamma ray repeaters ( sgrs ) ( inan et al . , 2007 ; tanaka et al . , 2008 ; mondal et al . ,",
    "2012 ) on earth s ionosphere is a subject of extended research for last few decades .",
    "there have been numerous measurements with very low frequency ( vlf ) radio waves ( mcrae , 2004 ; tanaka et al . , 2010 ; chakrabarti et al . ,",
    "2011 ) , gps ( afraimovich et al . , 2001 ; liu et al . , 2004 etc . ) , radar ( taylor & watkiks , 1970 ; watanabe & nishitani , 2013 ) etc . of such effects on different layers of the ionosphere , namely , d , e and f regions .",
    "these effects , which fall under a more generalized category called sudden ionospheric disturbances ( sids ) consist mainly of sharp rise and slow decay ( flares , grbs ) and their repetitions ( e.g. , sgrs ) .",
    "some models are present in the literature to analyze the effects of ionization on the ion - chemistry of the d - region ( mitra & rowe , 1972 ; turunen et al . , 1996 ; glukhov et al . , 1992 ) and e , f regions ( solomon , 2005 ; sojka et al . , 2013 etc . ) . based on these schemes , successful modeling of the effects of solar flares ( palit et al . , 2013 ) and other extra - terrestrial phenomena ( see , inan et al . ,",
    "2007 for @xmath0 ray flare from magnetar ) on the ionosphere has been carried out . with an advancement of knowledge of interaction of solar photon with the ionosphere and the chemical processes undergoing there we are now in a position to find spectral information of the ionizing events using the upper atmosphere which is a natural and everlasting detector of high energy photons through its unique response characteristics .",
    "x - rays and gamma rays of the injected spectra are of great interest mainly for lower ionosphere or the so - called d - region and regions below it .",
    "lower latitude d - region is affected by x - rays only , as energetic charged particles from the sun from the flare events are diverted by earth s magnetic field towards the polar regions .",
    "hence this low and mid latitude ionosphere can be safely used as a ` detector ' of high energy photons from extra terrestrial sources . from the ionization interaction of these photons",
    "we can compute the response function of this ` detector ' .",
    "of course , there is no collimation and pointing is very weak in the sense that the effects are the highest at the sub - event location and die out away from it .",
    "so unless there is a single energetic event which obviously dominates the sky , the effects we normally see are due to collective events and would be difficult to separate , as in any other detector .",
    "altitude variation of electron - ion production rates ( chapman , 1931 ; rees , 1989 ) should naturally contain the information of energy distribution of the incoming photons .",
    "processes such as recombinations , attachments and detachments etc . with or from ions and molecules ,",
    "help electron - ion densities to attain equilibrium values .",
    "thus , for obvious reasons , the energy distribution of ionizing x - ray photons during solar flares must put its imprints in the form of electron - ion density in the lower ionosphere during the occurrence of an event .",
    "vlf is found to be only suitable means by which the electron density at d - region ionosphere can be estimated on a regular basis .",
    "higher frequency radio signals from devices , such as incoherent scatter radars are usually very small and prone to be masked by interference and noise .",
    "satellite measurements are unlikely as air density at such heights produces too large drag for satellite to float .",
    "the height is also beyond the reach of scientific balloons .",
    "thus , we rely on vlf measurements for electron density distribution measurements .",
    "variation of electron - ion density affects vlf signal amplitude as it is reflected from the d - region .",
    "thus from the change in vlf amplitude , it should be possible to extract information about the injected spectra using a suitable deconvolution processes . in this paper",
    ", we have examined this possibility and start from the very basic continuity equation inside the d - region or the lower ionosphere . in",
    "what follows , we present a few such results of deconvolution and the results of our attempts to find solar flare spectrum from observed vlf modulation data . since vlf is reflected from lower ionosphere or the d - region ( in the day time )",
    ", we can acquire information about soft x - ray component only during flare events .",
    "results for other extra - terrestrial sources and for higher energy component of the spectrum will be presented elsewhere . in a way ,",
    "our present paper is exactly opposite of what was presented in palit et al .",
    "( 2013 ) where we reproduced the observed vlf signals starting from the injected solar spectrum .    in the next section ,",
    "we present the basic theory of how the spectrum produces the electron density - height distribution or a function of it and demonstrate the process of extracting the spectrum information from the distribution profile .",
    "section 3 contains our vlf data corresponding to some solar flares and how we reproduce the electron density information from the data . in section 4 ,",
    "we present the resulting spectra and compared them with those obtained from rhessi satellite data . in section 5 we investigate about the accuracy of the ionosphere - detector in providing spectrum information .",
    "finally , we discuss limitation of our method and make concluding remarks in the last section .",
    "the dynamics of electron density in the lower ionosphere ( d - region in day time ) is governed by a simple continuity equation , @xmath1 where , @xmath2 is the instantaneous electron density , @xmath3 is the electron - ion production rate by photons which consists of both the primary photoionizations and ionizations by the photoelectrons .",
    "@xmath4 is the ratio of negative ion density and free electron density and @xmath5 is the effective recombination coefficient .",
    "both @xmath4 and @xmath5 vary with time and height and effective variation of @xmath5 can be calculated accurately ( palit et al . 2013 ) . in a normal situation ,",
    "@xmath3 mostly consists of contribution from uv ionization . during a flare ,",
    "the ionization in the d - region by x - ray ( mainly @xmath6 kev ) is much more dominant over that due to enhanced uv .",
    "thus , the height variation of @xmath3 at any instant of time can be assumed to be governed by the incident x - ray spectrum only .",
    "a simplified form of @xmath3 due to x - ray as a function of time and height can be expressed after a suitable modification of chapman s formula , @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the irradiance or the solar flux at the top of the atmosphere in the frequency range @xmath10 to @xmath11 , @xmath12 is the absorption cross - section for the @xmath13 neutral component of air which is a function of energies of photons .",
    "@xmath14 is the concentration and @xmath15 is the photoionization efficiency for the @xmath13 component .",
    "@xmath16 is the grazing incidence function and is given by ( rees , 1989 ) @xmath17^{\\frac { 1}{2}}dh \\eqno{(3)}\\ ] ] for @xmath18 . from eqs . 1 and eqs .",
    "2 we get @xmath19 where , @xmath20 clearly eqs",

    "the basis function @xmath23 in eqs .",
    "4 is clearly the height profile of electron density produced by a single photon in the energy range @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",
    "we can find numerically the functions from the knowledge of the x - ray absorption cross - sections for different elements from nist x - ray mass attenuation coefficients table ( hubbell and seltzer , 1995 ; www.nist.gov/pml/data/xraycoef ) and the concentration of neutral elements ( msis 90 model , hedin et al .",
    ", 1991 ) using the values of @xmath24 during the occurrence of the flare . an average value of @xmath25 is taken to be @xmath26 as obtained in palit et al .",
    "( 2013 ) .",
    "some of the basis vectors are shown in fig .",
    "we find that the contribution in electron production in our range of interest ( @xmath27 km ) comes mainly from photons having energy from @xmath28 kev .",
    "we are interested here in the heights corresponding to the d - region of the ionosphere , from where vlf waves are reflected . at this region",
    "the values of the parameters such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 are determined from the interaction of neutral molecules , free electrons and three species of ions , namely ` positive ' , ` negative ' and ` positive cluster ' ions ( glukhov et al . , 1992 ,",
    "palit et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "the photons in higher energy ranges can also contribute in the electron - ion production rate at these heights , only if the abundance of photon in those ranges are sufficiently large , but for moderate solar flares this contribution above @xmath29 is negligible with respect to that from below it .    for grbs and sgrs",
    ", the contribution from higher energy x - ray and gamma - ray photons should be significant and extended to much lower heights ( down to @xmath30 ) .",
    "for such events we have to take into account the basis corresponding to higher energy photons and extend the analysis below the d - region , where the chemistry of interactions is different .",
    "for example , at lower heights ( @xmath31 50 km ) negative cluster ions ( inan et al . , 2007 ) has to be incorporated in the calculations .",
    "we present here two possible deconvolution methods , first of which is based on an iterative maximum likelihood estimation process and the other is based on radial basis function approximations and matrix inversion .      if for a particular @xmath10",
    ", @xmath23 is considered as the point spread function ( psf ) in a space expanded by the values of height , then the spectrum can be deconvolved from the profile @xmath32 ( see eqs .",
    "4 ) at any time with a bayesian based iterative maximum likelihood estimation method .",
    "we choose the richardson lucy algorithm ( richardson , 1972 ; lucy , 1974 ) and modified it somewhat to suit our case .    the richardson lucy algorithm in its most basic form is given by , @xmath33 where , @xmath34 here , @xmath35 is the ion density produced in @xmath36 height due to a single photon from flare in @xmath13 kev bin .",
    "@xmath37 corresponds to observed density distribution at different heights , as calculated from eqs .",
    "4 , @xmath38 is the expected latent distribution which is to be improved by each iteration ( @xmath39 ) from a trivially chosen distribution , say @xmath40 . in general consideration",
    ", the psf corresponds to the distributed real response in place of ideally desirable delta function response but in the ` same ' mathematical space . in our case , @xmath35 is in the mathematical space given by density - height distribution and is generated from a single photon in spectrum bin , which corresponds to our target space and different from the first one , so we had to modify the algorithm as given below .",
    "@xmath41 or , @xmath42 from a uniform set of values , chosen for each of the @xmath40s , the algorithm given by eqs .",
    "8 is found to converge , after a few iterations , to a certain distribution of @xmath38s .",
    "this set of values of @xmath38s can be taken as the injected spectrum .",
    "clearly the basis functions are not regular and orthogonal .",
    "we can approach this problem in a different way by choosing a set of appropriate radial basis functions since it can be shown that any continuous function on a compact interval can in principle be interpolated with arbitrary accuracy by a sum of these well behaved functions ( orr , 1996 ) .",
    "let us divide the height of consideration ( @xmath43 km ) into @xmath44 equal intervals .",
    "we choose @xmath44 gaussian functions centered at the midpoint ( @xmath45s ) of those @xmath44 intervals as our radial basis functions .",
    "so the @xmath46 radial basis function has the form @xmath47 we divide the whole range of spectrum ( say @xmath48 kev ) in @xmath49 separate intervals .",
    "we can write each of our original basis as linear combination of the radial basis functions , so that @xmath50 where @xmath51 corresponds to the @xmath52 interval in photon energy .",
    "we calculate the coefficients @xmath53 by matrix inversion method ( for example , see broomhead et al . , 1988 ) .",
    "let us assume @xmath53s form a matrix ( @xmath54 ) of dimension n x m. as each of the actual basis functions have their major contribution at different altitudes ( as they are centered at different heights ) the column vectors of matrix @xmath54 are clearly linearly independent .",
    "so the matrix @xmath54 is invertible .",
    "now the middle part of eqs .",
    "4 at time ` t ' can be written as , @xmath55 @xmath56 @xmath57 similarly , we expand the left hand side of eqs . 4 at the same time with the radial gaussian basis functions : @xmath58 comparing eqs . 11 and eqs",
    "12 we have , @xmath59 this is a matrix equation , which can be written as , @xmath60 inversion of this equation @xmath61 gives the spectrum at the time of consideration .",
    "the second method is an one step ( matrix inversion ) process and the existence of unique deconvolution is highly sensitive to the exact evaluation of the basis functions and the values of the parameters , namely @xmath5 and @xmath4 . on the other hand ,",
    "the first method is similar to an iterative spectrum fitting process and gives a result irrespective of variation ( even large ) of the parameter and basis values .",
    "we have tried both the deconvolution methods and found that the first method gives the best approximation for the injected spectra of the flares .",
    "we have considered this method in the current study and working on the optimization of the second one .",
    "in what follows , we analyze vlf amplitudes corresponding to one m2.6 and one x2.2 class solar flares which occurred on @xmath62 of june , 2009 and @xmath63 of february , 2011 respectively .",
    "we use vlf signal amplitude for the nwc transmitter received at the ionospheric and earthquake research centre ( ierc ) of indian centre for space physics ( icsp ) at a distance of 5691 km .",
    "the phase information has no role in obtaining the injected spectrum .",
    "first , by using the lwpc ( long wave propagation capability ) code developed by ferguson ( 1998 ) , we obtain changes in the ionospheric parameter due to solar flares and then by using wait formula ( wait , 1960 ; wait , 1962 ; wait and spice , 1964 ) we derive electron density profile as a function of time and height ( thomson , 1993 ; grubor et al . , 2008 ; pal and chakrabarti , 2010 ) .",
    "the lwpc code is a collection of separate programs which can be used according to user requirement .",
    "the long - wave propagation model ( lwpm ) is used as the default program in lwpc .",
    "this model treats the ionosphere as having exponential increase in conductivity with height . a log - linear slope ( @xmath64 in @xmath65 ) and a reference height ( @xmath66 )",
    "define this exponential model .",
    "we use this default lwpc model to find out the simulated unperturbed signal amplitude ( @xmath67 ) at a particular time .    in figs .",
    "2(a - b ) , we plot observed amplitude variations of vlf signal as a function of time during the m and x class flares .",
    "first , we calculate the deviation of the signal amplitude by subtracting the value of quiet day signal amplitude ( @xmath68 ) from the perturbed signal amplitude ( @xmath69 ) due to flares .",
    "@xmath70 we add this @xmath71a with the unperturbed simulated signal amplitude as obtained from lwpc .",
    "@xmath72 this @xmath73 is then used to obtain @xmath64 and @xmath66 parameters under the flare conditions . for this",
    ", we use the range - exponential model of lwpc where the user provides a set of trial @xmath64 and @xmath66 parameter at each time .",
    "the lwpc program is run to obtain the signal amplitude for that set and this amplitude is compared with @xmath74 ( grubor et al .",
    ", 2008 ; pal et al . , 2010 ) .",
    "this process is repeated till lwpc gives the signal amplitude which matches with the @xmath73 .",
    "the set of @xmath64 and @xmath66 which agrees best at a given time is chosen .",
    "the well - known wait s formula , that has been used to calculate the electron density profile for lower ionosphere during the flare is given by , @xmath75 , \\eqno{(18)}\\ ] ] where , @xmath76 is the electron density in @xmath77 at a height @xmath21 .",
    "we put the deduced values of @xmath64 and @xmath66 to calculate the electron density at different heights ( for different @xmath21 values ) during the peaks of the flares .    in figure 3 , we plot electron densities around the peak time of ( a ) m - class and ( b ) x - class flares at different altitudes in the d - region .",
    "values of the function @xmath78 , as obtained from eqs .",
    "4 are shown in fig .",
    "4 .    in our results",
    "we observe that peak of the electron density and the peak of the ionization rate occur at different times . as discussed in numerous papers ( zigman et al .",
    ", 2007 ; basak et al . , 2013 ; palit et al . ,",
    "2014 ) , the electron density peak and hence vlf modulation peak during any such ionization event should appear after a delay from that of the event peak or the ionization peak .",
    "this is due to the sluggishness of the lower ionosphere .",
    "we use the first deconvolution method ( section 2.3.1 ) to calculate the spectra of the two flares at their peaks using the profile of @xmath79 shown in fig .",
    "in fig . 5 , we show calculated photon spectra at the peak time of the m and the x - class flares under consideration .",
    "the solid curves correspond to the calculated spectra of the flares and the dashed curves correspond to those obtained from rhessi satellite data ( sui et al . , 2002 ) .",
    "we took the spectra of the flares from rhessi satellite using _ sswidl _ data analysis software . from the figure",
    "we see that the reconstructed spectra only up to @xmath80 kev match with the rhessi spectra satifactorily and above this energy , those deviate from the rhessi spectra significantly .",
    "this is probably because in the range of altitude of 60 - 80 km which vlf radio wave is sampling , the skywave is affected by soft x - ray photons only . from the nature of the calculated basis functions we find",
    "that for photons from 4 to 7 kev , most of the ionization occur in the height range of @xmath81 km , below ( 2 - 3 kev ) and above ( 8 - 15 kev ) this band , smaller but significant fraction of total ionization occurs in that height range .",
    "we anticipate that our procedure to obtain an approximate spectrum obtained by sampling @xmath81 km of the d - layer should be generally acceptable .",
    "since vlf radio samples only a thin shell of the ionosphere , it produces response function of a narrow energy band .",
    "thus , it is impossible to reconstruct the whole injected spectrum . in fig .",
    "1 we clearly see that the high energy photons produce maximum number of electrons at a much lower height",
    ". our method can reconstruct this high energy component also , only if we combine more advanced set of observations , such as those using incoherent scatter radar , along with vlf studies .",
    "our present effort is to be viewed as the first attempt to use the earth s lower ionosphere as a gigantic detector to reconstruct major radiation component that has impinged on it . in future",
    ", we will combine results of multi - wavelength observations to reconstruct more complete injected spectrum .",
    "indeed , our method would be very useful for those strong sources which may even saturate conventional detectors .",
    "in this section we estimate the accuracy with which we can estimate a spectrum of a solar flare in the range of our interest with the vlf observation of ionospheric modulation .",
    "the limit on accuracy is imposed by the minimum precision of the observed vlf data .",
    "this calculation is significant in two ways : first , it imposes an error bar on the calculated spectra and second , which is more important , it is equivalent to the resolving power of the assumed ionosphere - detector , ( with vlf response analysis as read out mechanism ) i.e. , the resolution or minimum difference in spectral features that the detector can measure .",
    "since lwpc follows the mode theory of vlf wave propagation in earth - ionosphere waveguide , we adopt the calculations from this theory . for the propagation of vlf in the curved path between the earth",
    "s ionosphere and ground and assuming a uniform height along the path the vertical electric field strength between a vertical transmitter and receiver is given by ( wait 1960 ) ,",
    "@xmath82 where , @xmath83 here , @xmath84 is the field of the source at a great - circle distance @xmath85 in a flat perfectly conducting earth , @xmath86 is the radius of the earth , @xmath21 is the height of the lower edge of the ionosphere and @xmath4 is the free - space vlf wavelength .",
    "@xmath87 is the coupling excitation factor between vlf transmitter and different modes .",
    "@xmath88 represents the height gain factor at this wavelength and is normalized to 1 at the ground and @xmath89 is the cosine of angle of incidence of @xmath46 wave mode in the lower ionospheric layer .",
    "the square of the amplitude of the field at the receiver can be written as , @xmath90 the vlf signal received , i.e. , the value of the power intensity averaged over width of the waveguide is obtained from @xmath91 , where , @xmath92 @xmath93 noting @xmath94 assuming large distance where very few ( @xmath31 1 ) waveguide mode persist @xmath95 and replacing @xmath89 by @xmath96 we have @xmath97 where , @xmath98 and @xmath99 where , the @xmath100 and @xmath101 correspond to the dielectric constant of the lower ionosphere and ground respectively , @xmath102 is the ground conductivity and @xmath103 is the wave angular frequency ( wait 1964 ) .    if the vlf signal amplitude corresponding to the ambient and flare conditions are @xmath104 and @xmath105 respectively , then the difference @xmath106 where , @xmath107 and @xmath108 are the average power intensity during ambient and flare conditions .    from eqs .",

    "the amplitude part of the mode resonance equation reads as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is the reflection coefficient of the lowest layer of the ionosphere and @xmath112 is that of the ground .",
    "if @xmath113 and @xmath114 are the ionospheric reflection coefficients during the disturbed and ambient conditions respectively and corresponding attenuation coefficients are @xmath115 and @xmath116 respectively , then @xmath117 for lower d region the effective dielectric constant of the medium can be approximated by an exponential function , such that the relative permittivity can be put in the form ( wait , 1963 ) , @xmath118 where , @xmath119 is the reference permittivity and @xmath120 is a constant .",

    "in this paper , we have demonstrated that the earth s ionosphere may be treated as a detector for strong sources of high energy radiation . depending on the physics of the interaction of the probe with the ionosphere ,",
    "the energy range of the spectrum will vary . in the present situation we use vlf radio propagation in the earth - ionosphere waveguide which samples lower ionosphere ( 60 - 80 km ) during moderately strong flares . since this layer is most sensitive to photons of up to about @xmath148 kev ,",
    "the spectra obtained at higher energies are not accurate enough .",
    "we find ( fig .",
    "5 ) that the thermal bremsstrahlung emission in m and x - class flares have been reproduced up to about @xmath149kev quite satisfactorily . it is to be noted that in palit et al ( 2013 ) , we have already solved the ` forward problem ' , i.e. , reproduction of the deviation of vlf signals obtained by vlf antennas from the x - ray spectrum . to our knowledge ,",
    "the ` inverse problem ' , namely , predicting radiation spectrum from radio sonde studies is carried out for the first time .",
    "we are aware of the fact that our final result strongly depends on the electron number density derived from the signal amplitude anomaly .",
    "the conventional and widely used lwpc code assumes that this number density is uniform over the entire propagation path and thus depending on a specific path , where such assumption is clearly violated , other method has to be adopted to compute electron density measurement .",
    "our method uses all the tools available , namely , ( a ) @xmath66 and @xmath64 parameters obtained at the peak flare time using lwpc , ( b ) the electron number density n and dn / dt using wait s formula at times close to the peak and finally ( c ) height distribution of the ion production rate from continuity equation and its derivatives .",
    "thus the accuracy of the final result can be improved only after improving these intermediate steps .",
    "presently satellites engaged in observing solar radiation have severe limitations .",
    "goes obtains light curves in two wide bands in x - rays .",
    "rhessi misses spectra at peaks of many flares as its good - time of observation is about twenty minutes per hour . in that respect a series of relatively less expensive ground based antennas which can observe the sun round",
    "the clock would be more than welcome , since accurate behavior of the solar spectrum can be obtained treating the earth as a gigantic detector .",
    "ours is thus a novel and alternative approach to obtain spectral information from strong sources with a maintenance free large area detector .",
    "choice of accurate basis function set is crucial .",
    "the basis functions are calculated here from purely theoretical considerations . for a proper deconvolution",
    ", the basis should be adjusted from the knowledge of the ionization obtained from theoretical and observational study .",
    "simulations such as monte carlo method adapted to calculate the ionization in palit et al .",
    "( 2013 ) are required . in time",
    ", the procedure could be perfected .",
    "proper calculation or observation of electron density distribution over height and time should be done .",
    "the lwpc estimation of the electron density is assumed on the empirical wait model of lower ionosphere .",
    "accuracy of the deconvolution of spectrum depends on the accurate estimation of electron density distribution at all heights . for this one may have to combine vlf observations with other methods , such as radar measurements . in any case",
    ", our approach remains valid and result would be more accurate when methods to obtain electron density is perfected .",
    "knowledge of the chemical processes and prevalent rate coefficients and their evolution throughout the flare occurrence time would be required .",
    "for instance , for weaker flares new reactions requiring lower photon energy are to be fed in computing the basis functions .",
    "once we have probes to sample different layers of ionosphere , we are in a position to obtain a complete and more accurate description of the injected spectrum of all combined events on the ionosphere . in the day time , the dominating ionizing agent is the sun itself and therefore it is expected that solar spectrum would be more accurately obtained , than the spectra of distant energetic events .",
    "one can find solar flare spectra in the entire energy range by extending the method above d - layer for the uv band of the spectrum and below d - layer for the hard x - ray and gamma ray bands of the spectrum .",
    "spectra of more energetic events such as gamma ray bursts and soft gamma ray repeaters in real time may be obtained , even when a satellite is saturated or misses the peak data .",
    "we shall explore these possibilities in future .",
