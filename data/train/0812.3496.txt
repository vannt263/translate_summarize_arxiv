    "the max - plus semiring @xmath0 is the set of real numbers , completed by @xmath1 , equipped with the addition @xmath2 and the multiplication @xmath3 .",
    "the name `` tropical '' is now used either as a synonym of `` max - plus '' , or in a wider sense , referring to algebraic structures of a similar nature .",
    "max - plus structures have appeared in relation with in a variety of fields , like operations research and optimization  @xcite , discrete event systems  @xcite , automata theory ( see  @xcite and its references ) , quasi - classic asymptotics  @xcite , hamilton - jacobi partial differential equations and optimal control @xcite , and more recently , tropical algebraic geometry , see in particular  @xcite .",
    "this has motivated the investigation of the analogues of basic questions in algebra , among which linear independence is an elementary but central one .",
    "the study of max - plus linear independence goes back to the work of cuninghame - green  @xcite , who defined a family to be _ weakly independent _ if no vector of the family is a linear combination of the others .",
    "this notion was further studied by moller  @xcite and wagneur  @xcite , who showed that a finitely generated linear subspace of @xmath4 admits a weakly independent generating family which is unique up to a reordering and a scaling of its vectors .",
    "this result was made more precise in further works by butkovi and cuninghame - green  @xcite , gaubert and katz  @xcite , butkovi , sergeev and schneider  @xcite .",
    "they developed a theory of extreme rays of max - plus linear spaces or `` cones '' ( as in classical convexity , a ray is the set of scalar multiples of a single vector ) .",
    "this theory shows in particular that the weakly independent generating family can be identified to the set of extreme rays .",
    "# 1>#1 the analogy with classical convex geometry can even be made more formal by noting that the map @xmath5 which associates to a finite set of rays in @xmath4 the linear span that it generates satisfies the _ anti - exchange axiom _ : @xmath6 whereas the classical linear span of a set of vectors satisfies the _ exchange axiom _ @xmath7 in other words , weak independence belongs to the theory of antimatroids rather than matroids  @xcite .",
    "gondran and minoux  @xcite defined a different notion of independence , which turns out to be closer to the classical one .",
    "a finite family is linearly dependent in their sense if it can be partitioned in two families that generate linear spaces with an intersection that is not reduced to the zero vector .",
    "they gave a remarkable characterization of the families of @xmath8 vectors of @xmath4 which are linearly dependent , in terms of the `` vanishing '' of their `` determinant '' ( this condition requires the sum of the weights of odd and even permutations to coincide ) .",
    "the theorem of gondran and minoux was extended in a paper published by an imaginary researcher named m. plus  @xcite , in which a symmetrized max - plus semiring @xmath9 was introduced , as well as a generalization of the notion of linear systems , in which the equality relation is replaced by a `` balance '' relation denoted @xmath10 .",
    "the symmetrized max - plus semiring comprises , besides the max - plus numbers , some `` negative '' and `` balanced '' numbers .",
    "a negative solution @xmath11 to a balance relation of the form @xmath12 means that the equation in which @xmath11 is put on the other side of the equality , @xmath13 , has a solution over @xmath0 . on this basis ,",
    "m.  plus developed an elimination technique , allowing him to establish generalizations of the gondran - minoux theorem , as well as analogues of several results of linear algebra including a `` cramer rule ''  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "in the recent work on tropical geometry , a different notion of independence has emerged : a family of vectors is said to be _ tropically dependent _ if we can make a linear ( i.e.  max - plus ) combination of its vectors in such a way that the maximum in every row is attained at least twice .",
    "richter - gebert , sturmfels and theobald  @xcite established an analogue of cramer theorem which applies to systems of `` tropical '' equations ( in which the maximum in every row is required to be attained at least twice , rather than being equal to the zero element of the semiring ) .",
    "izhakian  @xcite introduced an extension of the max - plus semiring , which is somehow reminiscent of the symmetrized max - plus semiring , and has two kind of elements , the `` real '' ones ( which can be identified to elements of the max - plus semiring ) and some `` ghost '' elements which are similar to the `` balanced '' ones .",
    "this allowed him to interpret the notion of tropical linear dependence in terms of suitably generalized equations over his extended semiring , and to relate tropical linear independence with the `` non - vanishing '' of determinants ( here , a determinant vanishes if there are at least two permutations of maximal weight ) .    in this paper , we give a unified treatment making explicit the analogy between tropical linear independence and izhakian s extension , on the one hand , and gondran - minoux dependence and m.  plus s symmetrization of the max - plus semiring , on the other hand .",
    "this unification yields as a byproduct some further results .",
    "the latter analogy is best explained in terms of amoebas .",
    "let @xmath14 denote the field of puiseux series in a variable @xmath15 with coefficients in a field @xmath16 , convergent in a neighborhood of the origin .",
    "there is a canonical valuation @xmath17 , sending a puiseux series to the opposite of the minimal exponent arising in its expansion .",
    "this valuation is almost a morphism from @xmath14 to @xmath0 , since @xmath18 with equality if the maximum is attained only once or if the monomials of minimal degree of @xmath19 and @xmath20 do not cancel , whereas @xmath21 .",
    "special instances of _ non - archimedean amoebas _  @xcite are obtained by taking images of algebraic varieties of @xmath22 by this valuation ( acting entrywise ) , and max - plus algebraic structures may be thought of as polyhedral or combinatorial tools to study such amoebas .    in a nutshell ,",
    "tropical linear independence and izhakian s extension arise when considering amoebas of linear spaces when the field of coefficients @xmath23 whereas gondran - minoux linear independence and m.  plus s symmetrization arise when taking @xmath24 . indeed ,",
    "if the series @xmath25 , for @xmath26 , satisfy @xmath27 it is clear that in every expression @xmath28 the maximum must be attained at least twice ( otherwise , the expression   would be nonzero due to the presence of a leading monomial ) .",
    "however , if all the series @xmath29 belong to @xmath30 , they must keep a constant sign as @xmath31 , leading to a more precise relation . for instance , if the @xmath32 all have a positive sign as @xmath31 , denoting @xmath33 ( resp .",
    "@xmath34 ) the set of @xmath35 for which @xmath36 is positive ( resp .",
    "negative ) as @xmath31 , we deduce that @xmath37 showing that the columns of the matrix obtained by applying the valuation @xmath17 to every column of the matrix @xmath38 is linearly dependent in the gondran - minoux sense .",
    "the goal of this paper , which is intended as a survey , although it contains some new results , is to draw attention to the symmetrization of the max - plus semiring , that we revisit in the light of the recent developments of tropical geometry .",
    "we show in particular that the proof of the cramer theorem of  @xcite , relying on elimination , also yields , by a mere substitution of izhakian s semiring to the symmetrized semiring , a ( slightly extended version ) of the tropical cramer theorem of  @xcite , see theorem  [ th - crameri ] and corollary  [ coro - sturmf ] below .",
    "the proof of these `` cramer theorems '' relies on a series of results , and in particular , on the semiring analogues of classical determinantal identities .",
    "we establish in section  [ sec - combinat ] a general transfer principle , building on an idea of reutenauer and straubing  @xcite , which shows that the semiring analogue of every classical identity can be proved automatically ( there is no need to find a `` bijective proof '' ) . in the next two sections ,",
    "we develop a theory of `` symmetrized semirings '' , which allow us to see both the symmetrization of the max - plus semiring and its extension by izhakian as special cases of a unique construction .",
    "we note that the notion of symmetrized semiring , as well as a version of the transfer principle , first appeared in  @xcite , but at that time , tropical geometry was not developed yet and the max - plus symmetrized semiring seemed to be the most ( if not the only ) significant model of this structure , which was therefore not further investigated .",
    "however , some extensions of the max - plus semiring like jets  @xcite or izhakian s extension  @xcite appeared later on , providing further interesting models .",
    "the unification and comparison of these approaches is a novelty of the present paper .    in the last two sections , we examine different notions of matrix rank that appear to be of interest in the max - plus semiring .",
    "such an enterprise was carried out by develin , santos , and sturmfels in  @xcite , but the ranks relying on symmetrization or on gondran - minoux linear independence were missing in  @xcite .",
    "we establish inequalities comparing them with the other ranks which are relevant in the max - plus setting .",
    "we also establish the analogues of several classical inequalities for matrix rank .",
    "a _ semiring _ is a set @xmath39 with two binary operations , addition , denoted by @xmath40 , and multiplication , denoted by @xmath41 or by concatenation , such that :    * @xmath39 is an abelian monoid under addition ( with neutral element denoted by @xmath42 and called zero ) ; * @xmath39 is a semigroup under multiplication ( with neutral element denoted by @xmath43 and called unit ) ;",
