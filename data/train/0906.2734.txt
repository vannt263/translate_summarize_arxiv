    "general theory of relativity , the rest of the @xmath1 of the energy density of the universe is termed dark energy , a mysterious component with negative effective pressure that is responsible for the observed accelerated expansion . for recent reviews of dark energy",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "there are many dark energy candidates .",
    "the simplest is einstein s cosmological constant @xmath2 .",
    "in addition , there are other options like xcdm , a slowly rolling scalar field , chaplygin gas , etc . , which can also give rise to an accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in this paper we constrain the parameters of three different dark energy models .",
    "the first model is the cosmological constant dominated cold dark matter ( @xmath2cdm ) model @xcite.in this model the energy density of the vacuum ( the cosmological constant ) does not vary with time and it has a negative pressure characterized by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the vacuum energy density .",
    "secondly , we consider the xcdm parameterization of dark energy .",
    "in this case dark energy is assumed to be a fluid satisfying the following relation between pressure and the energy density , @xmath5 , with @xmath6 ; this is not a physically complete model .",
    "lastly , we study the slowly rolling dark energy scalar field @xmath7 model ( @xmath7cdm ) with an inverse power - law potential energy density for the scalar field , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is a nonnegative constant @xcite.cdm model we consider here , @xmath7 only couples gravitationally to other components . for models where @xmath7 also interacts more directly with other components , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein . for other dark energy models ,",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "] we only consider the spatially - flat @xmath7cdm and xcdm cases .",
    "the @xmath7cdm model with @xmath10 and the xcdm model with @xmath11 are equivalent to the spatially - flat @xmath2cdm model with the same matter density . in all three models",
    "the nonrelativistic matter density is dominated by cold dark matter .",
    "in this paper we use two sets of lookback time versus redshift measurements , for galaxy clusters @xcite and for passively evolving galaxies @xcite , and apply a bayesian prior on the total age of the universe based on wmap estimates @xcite , to constrain parameters of these dark energy models .",
    "this time - based cosmological test differs from other widely - used distance - based cosmological tests .",
    "an important feature of this time - based method is that the age of distant objects are independent of each other .",
    "therefore , it may avoid biases that are present in techniques that use distances of primary or secondary indicators in the cosmic distance ladder method . in the literature a variety of time - based methods have been considered , based on measurements of the absolute age of objects , differential age of objects , and lookback time of objects .",
    "the absolute age method is based on the simple criterion that the age of the universe at a given redshift is always greater than or equal to the age of the oldest object at that redshift @xcite .",
    "the differential age method is based on the measurement of @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the redshift separation between the two passively evolving galaxies having the age difference @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "this method requires a large sample of passively evolving galaxies with high quality spectroscopy and is probably more reliable than the absolute age method as a number of systematic effects are eliminated .",
    "lookback time as a tool to constrain dark energy models was first used by @xcite who compiled a list of galaxy cluster ages and redshifts and used this data to constrain the xcdm dark energy parameterization .",
    "this data has been used to constrain brane cosmology and holographic dark energy models @xcite .",
    "the lookback time test has also been applied using passively evolving galaxies data , to constrain parameters of xcdm and @xmath2cdm @xcite . no doubt",
    "these time - based methods are subject to some different systematic errors but they offer an independent means to cross - check cosmological constraints obtained using other techniques .    in this paper",
    "we take advantage of the fact that the @xcite galaxy cluster data and the @xcite passive galaxy data are independent , so it is straightforward to use them simultaneously in a lookback time versus redshift test analysis of dark energy models .",
    "our joint analyses of these data sets allow us to derive the tightest lookback time constraints on dark energy parameters to date .",
    "the resulting constraints are moderately restrictive , and these data favor lower matter density values than do some other current data , but are consistent with a spatially - flat @xmath2cdm model in which nonrelativistic matter contributes 30% of the energy budget at a little less than two standard deviations . to derive tighter constraints , we perform a joint analysis of the lookback time data with current baryon acoustic peak and sneia measurements .    in sec",

    "current lookback time data by themselves are unable to tightly constrain cosmological parameters .",
    "constraints from galaxy cluster gas mass fraction versus redshift data ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , sneia apparent magnitude versus redshift measurements ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ) .    to get tighter constraints on cosmological parameters we combine the lookback time data and the measurement of the age of the universe with baryon acoustic peak data @xcite and sneia `` union '' apparent magnitude versus redshift measurements @xcite .",
    "since these data sets are independent we compute a joint likelihood function that is a product of individual likelihood functions @xmath90 and define the best - fit parameters and confidence level contours as discussed above .",
    "the constraints on the three dark energy models from a joint analysis of these data are shown in figs .",
    "46 . currently available lookback time data do not significantly change the results derived using bao peak measurements and sneia apparent magnitude data . in all three dark energy models when lookback time data are added to the mix the confidence level regions favor slightly smaller values of nonrelativistic matter density parameter @xmath39 .",
    "overall , current data is a good fit to all three dark energy models . for @xmath7cdm and xcdm",
    "they slightly favor time - dependent dark energy , but the time - independent cosmological constant is also a good fit .",
    "we anticipate that a new , improved data set of lookback times will soon be available ( r.  jimenez , private communication , 2009 . ) with more and better data we expect significantly tighter constraints on dark energy parameters .",
    "the lookback time versus redshift test , either by itself or at least in combination with other cosmological probes , could prove very useful in detecting or constraining dark energy time evolution .",
