    "the development of band structure calculation procedures is a theme to which an intense research activity has been devoted in modern solid state physics .",
    "this area of research has a long history due to existence of important unsolved and relevant questions concerning the structure of solids @xcite .",
    "one central open problem is the connection between the so called first principles schemes with the mott phenomenological approach .",
    "this important approach , furnishing the descriptions for a wide class of band structures of solids , is not naturally explained by the assumed fundamental first principles approaches @xcite .",
    "a class of materials which had been in the central place in the existing debate between these two conceptions for band structure calculations are the transition metal oxides ( tmo ) @xcite .",
    "a particular compound which is closely related with the tmo is the superconductor material @xmath0 in which the first band structure calculations predicted metal and paramagnetic characters , which are largely at variance with the known isolator and antiferromagnetic nature of the material @xcite .",
    "actually , these two qualities are fully believed to be purely strong correlation properties which are not derivable from hf independent particle descriptions @xcite .",
    "however , in refs .",
    "@xcite a single band hartree - fock ( hf ) study was able to produce these assumed strong correlation properties of @xmath0 , as independent particle ones , arising from a combination of crystal symmetry breaking in and an entanglement of the spin and spacial structure of the single particle states .",
    "therefore , this result opens the interesting possibility of clarifying the connection between the mott and slater viewpoints in the band theory of the tmo @xcite .",
    "it should be underlined that a former hf study of @xmath0 in ref .",
    "@xcite , also indicated an insulator an af character of the material .",
    "however , the extremely large gap (  @xmath1 ev ) which was predicted by that work had a radical discrepancy with the experimentally estimated value of @xmath2 ev .",
    "however , it could happens that the results of ref .",
    "@xcite could show a close link with the conclusions of refs .",
    "results in the literature supporting this possibility are the ones presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the same recourse employed in refs .",
    "@xcite of allowing a crystal symmetry breaking by doubling the unit cell of the lattice was employed . in that work ,",
    "the spin was treated in a phenomenological way by including a spin dependent functional in the variational evaluation done .",
    "these two procedures allowed the authors to predict an insulator and af structure for the material with a gap of 2 @xmath3 , well matching the experimental estimate .    the results in ref .",
    "@xcite were obtained  by starting form a tight binding ( t.b . ) model with a square lattice size equal to the distance between cu atoms in the cuo planes , by assuming a simple crystalline extended quadratic ( near the cu atoms ) t.b .",
    "the strength of the potential was fixed to reduce the width of the states to be smaller than the chosen lattice constant to obey the t.b . condition .",
    "afterwards the metal paramagnetic hf bands obtained when considering the coulomb interaction in the model ,  was fixed to approximately reproduce the single half filled band crossing the fermi level , obtained in the evaluation of the band structure of @xmath0 in ref .",
    "a curious point was that the value of the dielectric constant that was required to make equal the two bandwidths  was nearly @xmath4 .",
    "therefore , it come to the mind that the introduction of a dielectric constant in the hf equations of ref .",
    "@xcite , might be produced a band gap of nearly @xmath5  ev for @xmath6 being very close to the measured one of @xmath2 ev .",
    "this indicates that if a hf method could be extended to predict the screening properties , it could has the chance of  explaining the strongly correlation properties of @xmath0 and with luck , of its close related parents , the transition metal oxides .",
    "the possibility exist that such an approach could furnish a simple way of catching the strong correlation properties of these materials giving in this way a clear explanation for the mott properties , by showing its connection with the crystal symmetry breaking and spin - space entangled nature of single particle states @xcite .",
    "therefore , in this paper we intend to start generalizing the hf scheme to introduce screening effects . a first possibility is considered here by constructing an energy functional @xmath7 to be optimized by a set of single particle states . the functional @xmath7 for the hf scheme is simply taken as the mean value of the exact hamiltonian in the slater determinant of formed by the single particle functions over which @xmath7 is optimized .",
    "since we are interested in introducing coulomb interaction effects , a first general possibility consists in modifying the variational slater determinant of the single particle functions by connecting in it the coulomb interaction between the electrons and with nuclear `` jellium '' potential by employing the gell - mann - low procedure @xcite .",
    "this definition will have variational character , that is , will be equal to a mean value of the total hamiltonian in one state , and thus the result after finding the extremes over the one particle states , should be greater than the ground state energy of the system .",
    "however , the complications in solving the extremum equations following from introducing the coulomb and nuclear interaction in an exact form will be enormous .  however , we are only interested in catching improvement on the hf scheme produced by more simple screening processes .",
    "then , it becomes possible to approximate the above mentioned state ( the one resulting of the connection of the electronic interactions ) by restricting the sum over all the feynman graphs to a set reflecting screening properties .",
    "then , the simpler state will be chosen by only retaining in the sum given by the wick expansion , only the graphs for which : a ) for any line arriving to a point of a vertex and coming from a another different point , always exists another different line that joins the same two points .",
    "this definition basically retains the diagrams in which are essentially the `` tree '' diagrams ( having now closed loops ) in which arbitrary number of insertions of the polarization loop are included .",
    "the functional @xmath7 defined as the mean value of the hamiltonian is also an upper bound for the ground state energy .",
    "however , this functional expression although simpler , yet will  lead to slightly cumbersome procedure .",
    "thus , we defer its study to eventual future discussion .  in order to further simplify the form of the functional , but yet retaining screening effects",
    ", we even more simplify the functional by imposing the same screening approximation to the whole sum of feynman diagrams which defines the functional @xmath7 in which the coulomb and nuclear interactions are adiabatically connected .",
    "this definition leads to scheme which is formulated in very close terms with the usual discussions of the screening approximation in many body theory @xcite . up to now",
    ", we had not been able to show that this approximation also has a variational character .",
    "however , at least it follows that the feynman diagrams  defining the scheme represent allowed physical process , which suggests that the procedure can improve the hf results .  if the variational character turns to be valid , the result for energy will also furnish an upper bound for the ground state energy .",
    "this issue will be considered elsewhere .    after defining @xmath7 ,",
    "the generalized hf equations are derived for the general case of inhomogeneous electron systems .",
    "they include exchange and direct like terms , but also show additional contributions being related with effect of the coulomb interaction and nuclear potential on the kinetic energy of the electron which vanish for homogeneous systems .",
    "the equations are also written for the case homogeneous electron gas in which the full translation symmetry simplifies them . in this case , as in the usual hf scheme , only the kinetic and exchange terms are non vanishing . in this first exploration , it is assumed that the screening is static and the density is chosen to be one electron per sphere of radial dimension equal to the bohr radius . under these conditions ,",
    "the self - consistent equations for the electron spectrum and the static screening properties are solved by iterations .",
    "the result for the dispersion does not present the vanishing density of states at the fermi energy appearing in the fist in the hf self - energy spectrum @xcite .",
    "the work proceeds as follows . in section",
    "ii , the generalization of the hf functional and equations of motions for the single particle orbitals are presented .",
    "section iii then considers the application to the homogenous electron gas . in the conclusions",
    "the results are reviewed and possible extensions of the work are commented .",

    "the amplitudes @xmath132will have a spin dependence implicitly assumed @xmath133    since the lagrangian multipliers with different indices vanish as follows form the lagrange extremum conditions , after defining @xmath134 , the hf equations  take the simple form@xmath135 where the hamiltonian  is the sum of the following constants defined by the fourier transforms of the potential@xmath136    note that various potential terms in the general inhomogeneous case are not appearing because in the homogeneous electron systems , the `` jellium '' nuclear charge should rigorously cancel the electron charge for the system to be homogeneous .",
    "the vanishing of one of these terms , in which the total density is not appearing , also follows after being directly evaluated .",
    "the electron green function in momentum space is @xmath137 and the screening potential as a function of the polarization is given by @xmath138    finally , the fourier transform of the polarization function can be evaluated as follows@xmath139      in this subsection we now iteratively solve the set of self - consistent equations for the electron orbitals .  in order to simplify the evaluation",
    ", we will  assume the validity of the static approximation .",
    "that is , the polarization at all frequencies @xmath140 will be substituted by its value at zero frequency @xmath141  in other words , the effective potential will act  in the same instantaneous way as the  coulomb potential does . in",
    "what follows , in order to simplify the notation we will not use the combined space - spin momenta notation @xmath142=@xmath143 which is however helpful in less symmetric problems .   the self - consistent  connection between the quantities can be described as follows .",
    "firstly , the screened coulomb potential can be evaluated from the frequency independent formula @xmath144 in terms of the known coulomb potential @xmath145 and the frequency independent polarization expression@xmath146 which is fully defined in terms of the energy spectrum @xmath147  then , this set of energies can be determined again in terms of the screened potential @xmath148 by means of solving the fock hamiltonian equations @xmath149    in a more detailed form , firstly we choose the coulomb  potential @xmath145 as the first approximation for  @xmath148 in the fock hamiltonian equations , to determine the first approximation for the energy spectrum .",
    "next , the single particle energies defined in this approximation , are used to evaluate the polarization @xmath150 and with this quantity , a new approximation for the screened potential @xmath148 is calculated .",
    "afterwards , knowing @xmath148 ,  the same cycle is repeated again iteratively up to arriving to stable values of the three quantities @xmath150 @xmath151 and @xmath152 .    for",
    "the homogeneous electron gas the fermi momentum @xmath153 ,  defined by @xmath154  will  fully determine the properties of the solution .",
    "it can be defined as usual , the mean radius per particle @xmath155 in terms of the volume of the gas @xmath131 and the number of particles @xmath19 by @xmath156 .",
    "then , the fermi wavevector @xmath153 expresses in terms of @xmath157  in the form @xmath158 given the bohr radius expression @xmath159=@xmath160 the value of @xmath153  that was be chosen for the calculation was @xmath161    that is , the electron gas density is assumed to be close to one electron within the volume of a sphere having as its radius @xmath159 .",
    "the  expression of the  self - energies in the first step of the iterative process , is obtained assuming that the @xmath148 coincides with the coulomb potential , that is @xmath162 then , the exchange @xmath163 and the total @xmath164 energies coincide with usual @xmath29 results @xmath165    afterwards , the first iterative value of the polarization @xmath166 , was evaluated with the use of ( [ p ] ) by substituting in this expression the spectrum @xmath164  in  ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath166 obtained were then employed to evaluate the first iterative values of the  screened potential @xmath167 through formula ( [ venp ] ) .            henceforth , the function @xmath168  allowed to start the cycle again , to find the similar quantities in the second step @xmath169 @xmath30and @xmath170 through the same procedure followed before .     in the three iterations in which it was evaluated .",
    "again , the difference between the second an the third iteration ( corresponding to the two superposed upper curves ) can not be noticed in the scale of the graphic .",
    ", width=245 ]    the described cycles were repeated three times , after which the evaluated quantities closely approached to self - consistent values of the functions @xmath171 @xmath30and @xmath172  the third iteration for the screened potential allowed to evaluate one further iteration for the energy , which explains the number of four plotted curves in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "the  results for these quantities in the various steps  are illustrated  in figures [ fig4]-[fig7 ] .",
    ", which shows a large reduction of the exchange energy of the usual hf solution .",
    "since the screening properties had been assumed in the static approximation , is not clear whether this reduction of the exchange energy will also appears when the exact dynamic screening effects will be considered . ,",
    "width=245 ]    the  plots in each of these pictures show the  values of the quantities in the  few steps which were required to  attain convergence .",
    "it followed that the energies , and screening potentials rapidly attain their selfconsistent values after two steps of the iteration process .  in all of the pictures [ fig4 ] , [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ]",
    ", the differences between the second , and third iterations can not be noticed .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] illustrates the outcome for single particle energy spectra for the four iterations done in the solving the generalized hf equations .",
    "the system considered corresponds to an inter - electron mean distance being close to the bohr radius .",
    "the energy dependence of the first iteration , coincided with the hf result .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] gives an augmented picture of the energies of the last two iterations in the low momentum region .",
    "it is shown to evidence the rapid convergence of the procedure .",
    "the energy associated to the second , third and fourth are shown , but the third and the fourth , do not differentiate in the scale of the figure .    figures [ fig6 ] and [ fig7 ] show the results for the polarization @xmath173 and the screened potential @xmath151 .",
    "the plots indicate that the amount of screening at the considered electron density is high .",
    "this can be also noticed from the spectra shown in figure [ fig4 ] , which evidences a large reduction of the exchange energy of the usual hf solution .",
    "however , since the screening properties in the present exploratory study , had been assumed in the static approximation , is not clear whether or not this effect will also appears when the exact dynamic screening effects will be considered .  this question is expected to be considered elsewhere@xmath174    the calculations done in the work referred to homogeneous systems and a very particular value of the density , in order to simply illustrate the implementation of the procedure . with this same purpose the strong static approximation for the polarization properties was also assumed",
    ". however , a further investigation of the homogeneous systems is yet a subject of appreciable physical interest and it is expected to be considered elsewhere . in particular , the inclusion of the dynamic screening effects could  modify the results for the energy , which are higher than the hf ones .",
    "finally , it can be noted that the derivative of the energy dispersion at the fermi  momentum @xmath153 is finite in the solution , thus eliminating this known difficulty of the hf self - energy spectrum  @xcite .",
    "a generalization of the self - consistent hartree fock procedure including screening effects was introduced .",
    "expressions for the hf like functional and its system of self - consistent equations are presented",
    ".  for inhomogeneous electron systems , the equations include additional terms to the standard direct and exchange potentials .",
    "the presence of the nuclear charge is included in the scheme , seeking to allow its further application in the developing of band calculation procedures . to start exploring the implementation of the analysis , it is applied to the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "the system hf equations is then iteratively solved in the further simplified case of assuming that the dielectric properties are taken in the unretarded approximation .",
    "the electron density is fixed to be approximately correspond to one bohr radius mean inter - electron distance .",
    "the system of equations is solved iteratively by approximating , the screened potential by the coulomb one in evaluating the first iteration for the spectrum for the electron energies .",
    "afterwards , the screened potential and the new spectrum determined by it , were recursively calculated .",
    "the results indicate that in the non retarded approximation , both the direct and the exchange potential are strongly screened .",
    "therefore the energy spectrum behaves very closely to the free electron one .",
    "thus , the the non retarded approximation does not produce an improvement in lowering the energy of the standard hf procedure .",
    "the possibility for such an improvement was a central motivation for the present work .",
    "however , the non retardation assumption is a dynamical simplification which is not necessarily compatible with the ( not shown here , but expected to be valid ) variational character of the scheme .",
    "therefore , the hope exist , that after performing a similar iterative solution , but without assuming the static approximation for the fermion loops , can produce an energy competing with the the standard hf one .",
    "this iterative solution , is not very much difficult than the one done in this work .",
    "thus , if it becomes able to furnish an energy competing with the hf one , the method could become a helpful one .",
    "the existence of sum rules for the frequency dependent dielectric quantities rises the expectation about they could incorporate lowering energy contribution , possibly becoming able to contest with the exchange energy in the usual hf scheme of the homogeneous electron gas .",
    "this question will be investigated in the next extension of the work .",
    "one point to be underlined is that in the homogeneous electron gas , it is known that the @xmath29 scheme predicts a non physical vanishing density of states at the fermi level @xcite , it is clear that this property is eliminated in there result of the iterative process in the proposed scheme .",
    "it should be also remarked that the present work , had been motivated , precisely by the idea of deriving in its further extension , the crystal symmetry breaking and spin - space entanglement effects obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for @xmath0 .  in these works , a simple model of the cuo planes was constructed .",
    "it was defined by a set coulomb interacting electrons , for which the free hamiltonian was taken as a tight binding one .",
    "the electrons were assumed to half fill a single tight binding band .",
    "the lattice of the model was chosen as the 2d crystal formed by the cu atoms in the cuo planes .",
    "the coulomb interaction in the system was then considered in the hf approximation . in the study ,",
    "a phenomenological value of the dielectric constant of nearly @xmath175 was assumed to screen the coulomb interaction .",
    "this consideration was done in order to match the width of the @xmath29 spectrum of the coulomb interacting electrons , with the width of the single half filled band crossing the fermi level , arising in the matheiss full band structure calculation in ref .",
    "after that , by simply eliminating some usually imposed symmetry constraints on the hf procedure , a fully unrestricted hf solution of the hf problem predicted an insulator gap and the antiferromagnetic structure for the @xmath0 , which are considered as pure strong correlation effects in the material .",
    "the above circumstances , also motivated the idea of constructing a full @xmath29 band calculation scheme , eventually being able to predict the assumed dielectric screening in ref .",
    "@xcite ,  by also incorporating the mentioned crystal symmetry breaking and spin - spacial entanglement effects , in describing the mott strong correlation properties of the @xmath0 material .",
    "the possibility to derive the above mentioned ( just fitted in @xcite ) dielectric constant , is suggested by the following circumstance .",
    "the usual @xmath29 band structure evaluations of the @xmath0 are known to predict an enormous band gap of nearly @xmath1 ev @xcite . however , after dividing this energy gap by the value of @xmath176 for the dielectric constant employed in the described model of cuo planes , gives a result of @xmath5 ev , which is close to the measured gap of the @xmath0 of @xmath2 ev .",
    "then , the expectation arises that a band calculation scheme based in the proposed modified hf scheme , could work in predicting the main strong correlation properties of the @xmath0 , and eventually of  its close related transition metal oxides .",
    "the investigation of these possibilities is expected to be considered elsewhere .    the author ( a.c . )",
