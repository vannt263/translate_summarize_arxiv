    "single domain magnetic nanoparticles ( mnp ) and their colloidal suspensions have attracted a lot of attention in the recent years @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the growing interest is due to a variety of technological applications associated with them .",
    "these range from mechanical and thermal applications involving their usage as sealants , lubricants and coolants to challenging applications in medicine for the purpose of magnetic resonance imaging , targeted drug delivery and biomarkers and biosensors to name a few .",
    "the main reason behind their wide applicability is the ease with which they can be detected and manipulated by the application of an external magnetic field .",
    "their response times are strongly size - dependent , thus introducing the possibility of synthesizing particles to yield application tailored response times .",
    "most practical applications require appropriate surfactant coatings to prevent agglomeration and sedimentation of magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "many biological and medical applications require nanoparticles with biologically relevant coatings in order to use them as probes and carriers @xcite .",
    "such coatings enhance the particle size , although the magnetic volume remains unchanged .",
    "the neel and brownian relaxation times which characterize the dynamics of the suspension depend not only upon the constituting material , but also the magnetic volume and the enhanced volume due to surfactant coating .",
    "the interplay of these parameters governs whether one or both relaxation times contribute to the dynamics @xcite-@xcite,@xcite . in the present paper ,",
    "we systematically analyze the effect of the above parameters on the relaxation times .",
    "we also study the ac susceptibility @xmath0 , the most commonly studied response function , in various regimes characterized by the relative dominance of the two relaxation times .",
    "this understanding makes it possible to estimate relaxation times as well as related parameters from the measurement of @xmath0 in the laboratory .",
    "all experimental samples have a distribution of particle sizes and are referred to as polydisperse .",
    "the particle size distributions in experimental samples , usually obtained by a tunnelling electron microscopy ( tem ) analysis , are found to have a log - normal form @xcite .",
    "hence we incorporate the effect of polydispersity in our calculations of @xmath0 .",
    "as the neel and brownian relaxation times have a strong dependence on particle size , polydispersity leads to a considerable broadening and sometimes an additional peak in @xmath1 .",
    "we have also worked out a procedure to obtain particle size distributions from the susceptibility data via cole - cole plots when they are unavailable @xcite .",
    "the above approach assumes the _ single particle model _ @xcite applicable to dilute suspensions in which magnetic interactions amongst particles may be ignored .",
    "many biological applications are particularly benefitted by this approach .",
    "for instance diagnostic tools such as magnetic resonance imaging rely on transport and manipulation of individual magnetic particles bound by fluorescent dyes through blood vessels @xcite .",
    "however many mechanical and thermal applications rely on viscosity effects arising due to a higher density of mnp in the suspensions .",
    "when present in sufficient concentration , clustering and chaining of mnp is rather common as observed by electron microscopy or dynamic light scattering studies @xcite-@xcite . this behavior is undesirable in many applications using magnetic fluids as sealants , coolants , lubricants , printing inks , etc . where invariance of the magnetic and fluid properties are paramount @xcite . on the other hand magnetic domain detection , optical shutters , tagging of surfaces and other entities",
    "benefit from clustering of mnp @xcite .",
    "it is hence useful to understand the mechanisms responsible for clustering and the dependence of cluster - size distributions and average cluster sizes on the parameters describing the experimental sample . with this knowledge",
    ", it may be possible to synthesize application tailored suspensions .",
    "aggregation results due to a variety of interaction energies which come into play in magnetic suspension @xcite .",
    "typically these are dipolar , van der waal and steric interactions . of these",
    "the former two are attractive while the later is repulsive .",
    "their relative strengths are governed by the magnetic compound , the magnetic volume , the thickness of the surfactant coating as well as the properties of the suspending liquid .",
    "additionally , temperature acts as a disordering agent which can not only hinder aggregation but also introduce the possibility of detachment of the basic unit(s ) from the parent cluster .",
    "thus we expect the cluster - size distribution and average cluster size to be governed by the interplay of the attractive and repulsive forces amongst the interacting particles and the ambient temperature of the suspension .",
    "earlier models addressing the issue of clustering in mnp suspensions have treated aggregation as an irreversible mechanism .",
    "these models obtain a power law growth for the average cluster size in the initial stages of aggregation while the steady - state is characterized by a single cluster comprising of all the particles in the suspension @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the later is often referred to as an infinite cluster .",
    "we further add fragmentation in the model to counter irreversible aggregation , due to the presence of repulsive interactions and temperature .",
    "the two competing mechanisms make cluster formation a self - limiting process resulting in a distribution of clusters of varying sizes with the average cluster size governed by the ratio @xmath2 of the aggregation and fragmentation rates .",
    "we obtain the steady - state cluster - size distributions and the evolution of the mean cluster size to its steady - state value for different values of @xmath2 .",
    "both these functions exhibit scaling .",
    "we have compared our results with sets of experimental data to lend credence to our interpretations and observations of the aggregation - fragmentation model .",
    "these comparisons are much to our satisfaction .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ s2 ] deals with relaxation mechanisms and response functions of dilute mnp suspensions using the single particle model . in section  [ s2_1 ]",
    ", we introduce the neel and brownian relaxation times and identify regimes where either or both relaxation times contribute .",
    "polydispersity and its characterization is introduced in section  [ s2_2 ] .",
    "the calculation of the ac susceptibility @xmath0 for monodisperse and polydisperse samples in the different regimes described above is presented in section  [ s2_3 ] . in section  [ s2_4 ] , we provide a procedure to obtain particle - size distributions ( for polydisperse samples ) using cole - cole plots obtained from @xmath0 . section  [ s3 ] deals with aspects of clustering occuring in samples which are no longer governed by the single particle approximation .",
    "interactions prevalent in samples exhibiting these phenomena are introduced in section  [ s3_1 ] .",
    "we introduce the aggregation - fragmentation model to describe clustering in section  [ s3_2 ] .",
    "the numerical results are presented in section  [ s3_3 ] .",
    "their comparisons with corresponding measurements in a variety of experimental systems are presented in section  [ s3_4 ] .",
    "finally we conclude this paper with a summary and discussion in section  [ s4 ] .",
    "we now study the relaxation properties and the response functions in dilute mnp suspensions where inter - particle interactions can be ignored . in this regime",
    "the particles essentially behave as independent , single - domain , super paramagnetic entities .",
    "a ferromagnetic sample such as iron for instance , has no net magnetization even below the curie temperature .",
    "this is so because the sample comprises of domains , each having spontaneous magnetization pointing in a different direction .",
    "however if the size of the body is reduced , there comes a point beyond which the magnetostatic energy and the energy for forming domain walls compete in such a way that a single domain state becomes preferable @xcite .",
    "the direction of magnetization of the single domain particle does not remain fixed in time though , but undergoes fluctuations or `` relaxations '' as the magnetic moment rotates between the crystallographic anisotropy axes . as a result the time averaged magnetization is still zero and the particle is still paramagnetic .",
    "it is called `` super paramagnetic '' because each particle has a giant magnetic moment arising due to a large number ( @xmath3 ) of individual atomic moments .",
    "we now describe the mechanisms of relaxation of these single domain super paramagnetic particles suspended in a liquid .",
    "the magnetization vector of a single domain particle is given by @xcite : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the magnetic volume of a particle with radius @xmath6 usually reffered to as the core radius , @xmath7 is the saturation magnetization and @xmath8 a unit vector in the direction of the magnetization . in the case of uniaxial anisotropy ( in the z - direction",
    "say ) , the magnetic energy is given by @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the effective magnetic anisotropy constant and @xmath11 is the angle between the z - axis and @xmath8 .",
    "minimum energy occurs at @xmath12 = 0 and @xmath13 defining two equilibrium orientations corresponding to magnetizations @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "if thermal fluctuations are strong enough , magnetic moment reversal takes place within the particle by overcoming the energy barrier ( of height @xmath16 ) . this reversal or switching time",
    "is called neel relaxation time and is given by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is related to the inverse of the attempt frequency of magnetic reversal .",
    "there is another mechanism by which the magnetic moment of a super paramagnetic particle suspended in a fluid can relax .",
    "this mechanism of relaxation can be due to the physical rotation of the particle within the fluid .",
    "it is referred to as brownian rotational motion as it occurs due to the thermal fluctuations in the suspended medium .",
    "the brownian relaxation time is given by @xcite @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the dynamic viscosity of carrier liquid and @xmath21 is the hydrodynamic radius defined as the sum of the core radius @xmath6 of the mnp and the surfactant coating @xmath22 over it .    as can be seen from eqs.([neel ] ) and ( [ brown ] ) , both neel and brownian relaxation times are highly sensitive to the particle size .",
    "while @xmath23 increases exponentially , @xmath24 grows linearly with the particle dimension .",
    "it is customary to define an effective relaxation time as follows @xcite : @xmath25 thus it is possible to tailor time scales by an appropriate choice of parameters , particularly @xmath10 , @xmath6 and @xmath21 . with this in mind , we have systematically studied the effect of @xmath6 and @xmath21 on @xmath23 and @xmath24 and consequently @xmath26 for maghemite ( @xmath27 ) particles used most commonly in making magnetic fluids .    in table",
    "i , we summarize our evaluations of @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath26 for particles with varying magnetic core radius @xmath6 and the thickness of the surfactant coating @xmath22 . in most experiments ,",
    "the later is usually in the range of 2 - 6 @xmath28 .",
    "as is observed in table i , @xmath24 is practically unaffected by @xmath22 . for small particles , @xmath29 which results in @xmath30 .",
    "the relaxation then takes place by rotation of the magnetic moment inside the particle . for large particles on the other hand , @xmath31 .",
    "consequently @xmath32 and the relaxation is due to a physical rotation of the particle in the suspension .",
    "thus the choice of the relaxation mode is primarily governed by the particle size .",
    "for critical particle sizes , often called the cross - over radius @xmath33 ( @xmath34 in table i ) , it is found that both mechanisms contribute to the relaxation of the suspended particle .",
    "we have studied the effect of temperature @xmath35 , the surfactant coating @xmath22 and the anisotropy constant @xmath10 on the cross - over radius @xmath33 .",
    "most applications require an operating temperature in the range of 270 to 320 @xmath10 .",
    "we find that @xmath33 does not change perceptibly in this range .",
    "further , as seen from table i the variation of @xmath22 does not significatly alter @xmath33 .",
    "the anisotropy constant @xmath10 on the other hand , leads to a substantial change in the corresponding value of the cross - over radius . in figure 1 ,",
    "we plot @xmath33 as a function of the anisotropy constant @xmath10 for a few frequently used biological and commercial spherical , magnetic nanoparticles .",
    "in all these evaluations , the temperature is assumed to be 300 @xmath10 and the surfactant coating @xmath22 has been taken to be 2 @xmath28 .",
    "the figure indicates that the value of the cross - over radius @xmath33 is smaller for larger values of anisotropy @xmath10 .",
    "thus amongst the three parameters of relevance , the anisotropy constant @xmath10 affects the cross - over radius @xmath33 the most .",
    "monodisperse samples are an idealization .",
    "a variation in the particle size is inherent in all experimental samples .",
    "tem studies of several samples have revealed a log - normal distribution for the variation of particle sizes @xcite .",
    "thus the probability density @xmath36 of having particles within radius @xmath6 and @xmath37 can be written as : @xmath38dr_{c},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the mean and variance of the distribution . due to the strong dependence of both neel and brownian relaxation times on particle size ,",
    "it is evident that a distribution of relaxation times will be obtained if the suspended particles have a distribution of sizes .",
    "the presence of polydispersity leads to a significant change in the behavior of the response function of the sample as we shall see in the following subsection .",
    "the complex susceptibility @xmath0 of a suspension of monodisperse mnp in the linear response regime has the debye form given by @xcite : @xmath41 where @xmath42 @xmath43 @xmath44 @xmath43 @xmath45 is the static susceptibility of the sample comprising of n monodisperse particles of volume v with a saturation magnetization @xmath46 .",
    "the effective relaxation time @xmath26 is defined by eq .",
    "( [ teff ] ) .",
    "an experimental time scale is provided by @xmath47 , the inverse of the frequency of the applied oscillatory field . if @xmath48 @xmath49 1 , the response is given by the static susceptibility @xmath42 bearing the characteristic @xmath50 dependence .",
    "on the other hand , if the two time scales are comparable , i.e. when @xmath48 @xmath51 1 , the response is marked by strong frequency dependent effects . separating the real and the imaginary parts of susceptibility yields : @xmath52 the imaginary part of the susceptibility",
    ", @xmath53 governs dissipation in the system .",
    "when plotted as a function of the frequency , it exhibits a symmetric peak around @xmath54 = @xmath55 .",
    "alternatively , the peak frequency can provide information about the radius @xmath6 as well as the hydrodynamic radius @xmath21 of the particle as will be discussed shortly .",
    "the susceptibility response gets substantially altered in the presence of polydispersity . for polydisperse samples",
    ", @xmath53 needs to be averaged over the particle size distribution @xmath56 .",
    "thus @xmath57 in figure 2 , we plot eq .  ( [ imchi ] ) ( open circles ) for monodisperse samples corresponding to three different values of @xmath58 4 , 8 and 12 @xmath28 .",
    "the chosen values correspond to ( a ) @xmath59 , ( b ) @xmath60 and ( c ) @xmath61 respectively for maghemite particles used to generate data of table i. all cases exhibit the characteristic debye form . to understand the effect of polydispersity , we also plot eq .",
    "( [ imchip ] ) ( filled circles ) in the same figure .",
    "the distribution @xmath56 vs. @xmath6 used for the evaluations were obtained from a tem analysis of maghemite samples used in reference @xcite .",
    "these distributions had a log - normal form with a variance @xmath62 0.35 .",
    "the mean value @xmath39 is the particle size of the corresponding monodisperse evaluation .    as seen in figure 2",
    ", a broadening of the response function is observed in all cases after the inclusion of polydispersity .",
    "the response no longer has the symmetric debye form . in figure 2a ,",
    "the peak frequency provides information about the mean core radius @xmath39 .",
    "the width of the log - normal distribution often gives rise to a small brownian peak although @xmath39 @xmath63 @xmath33 and the particles predominantly exhibit neel relaxation a pronounced two - peak response is obtained in figure 2b since @xmath39 @xmath51 @xmath33 .",
    "both neel and brownian relaxation contribute in this regime .",
    "the frequencies corresponding to the peak values yield information about the average values of core and the hydrodynamic radii @xmath39 and @xmath64 of the particles .",
    "finally when @xmath39 @xmath65 @xmath33 , the brownian relaxation dominates and the frequency corresponding to the peak provides information regarding the hydrodynamic radius @xmath64 of the particle . comparing figures 2a and 2c , it is clear that polydispersity affects neel relaxation more significantly than brownian relaxation as expected ( cf .",
    "( [ neel ] ) and ( [ brown ] ) ) .      the information on distribution of relaxation times can be obtained from susceptibility measurements by empirical models .",
    "the most frequently used model for obtaining the distribution of relaxation times is the cole - cole model .",
    "based on this model , the dynamic susceptibility @xmath0 with multiple relaxation times is given by @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the central relaxation time about which all the other relaxation times are distributed and @xmath68 is a fitting parameter with limits 0@xmath691 . the equation reduces to the debye equation for @xmath68=0 . as the deviation from the single relaxation time model becomes greater ,",
    "@xmath701 . separating the real and imaginary parts of eq.([chic ] ) , we obtain : @xmath71 where @xmath72 @xmath43 @xmath73 .    cole and cole proposed a method of graphically representing the effects of multiple relaxation times .",
    "the method consists of plotting @xmath53 for a certain frequency against @xmath74 at the same frequency .",
    "these are called cole - cole plots . when @xmath68 @xmath43 0 , the cole - cole plot is a semi - circle .",
    "when @xmath68 @xmath65 0 , the cole - cole plot is still a semi - circular arc similar to a widened debye curve , but in this case the centre lies below the horizontal axis .",
    "the plot is symmetrical about the vertical line passing through the point @xmath74",
    "@xmath43 @xmath75 when @xmath53 is maximum at a frequency @xmath76 .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 can be determined from the cole - cole plot by a graphical construction .",
    "we do not reiterate this rather well established procedure here , but refer the reader to reference @xcite for it .",
    "it may also be determined by best fits of eq .",
    "( [ reimc1])and eq .",
    "( [ reimc2 ] ) to the experimental data .",
    "it should be noted that the symmetrical distribution of relaxation times is a consequence of a particle size distribution which is symmetric about the mean value @xmath39 .",
    "the cole - cole model assumes a gaussian form for @xmath56 vs. @xmath6 .",
    "the parameter @xmath68 is hence related to the spread of the gaussian distribution with @xmath68 @xmath43 0 yielding a delta function or a monodisperse particle size distribution .",
    "the response functions in typical mnp suspensions , as observed from figure 2 , are asymmetrical primarily due to the log - normal particle size distributions .",
    "the cole- cole model is thus not the most suitable for their description .",
    "experimental systems exhibiting asymmetric response functions can be conveniently represented by an expression due to cole and davidson .",
    "the ac susceptibility in this model is given by @xcite : @xmath77 where @xmath78 and is related to the deviation from the single relaxation time model .",
    "the debye form of eq .",
    "( [ debye ] ) is recovered when @xmath79 . separating the real and imaginary parts of eq .",
    "( [ chidc ] ) results in : @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "( [ rchicd ] ) and ( [ imchicd ] ) give rise to a `` skewed arc '' in the cole - cole plots .",
    "the parameter @xmath82 can be obtained by a graphical construction or by fitting the experimental data corresponding to @xmath74 and @xmath53 with eqs .",
    "( [ rchicd])-([imchicd ] ) .    in figure 3",
    "we show the cole - cole plots for the same polydisperse samples that were used to obtain data of figure 2 .",
    "the cases ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) correspond to @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 respectively .",
    "in all the three cases , the centre of the arc lies below the horizontal axis due to multiple relaxation times resulting from polydispersity .",
    "further , the asymmetry in the particle size distributions is reflected in the asymmetry of the arcs .",
    "the cole - cole plots are distinct in each of the regimes .",
    "in particular , the cross - over regime is characterized by a two - humped form signifying a comparable contribution of both neel and brownian relaxation to the response function .",
    "thus significant information regarding the experimental sample can be inferred from the cole - cole plots .",
    "we now provide a simple procedure for evaluating the particle - size distribution @xmath56 vs. @xmath6 in the experimental sample when the response function exhibits multiple relaxation times . assuming a log - normal form , @xmath56 vs. @xmath6",
    "is characterized by its mean @xmath39 and variance @xmath40 signifying the spread in the particle - size distributions . while the evaluation of @xmath39 is straightforward , the variance @xmath40 needs to be estimated . recalling that multiple relaxation times are a consequence of polydispersity , it is imperative to connect @xmath82 with @xmath40 . in order to find this relationship ,",
    "we have gone through the following sequence of steps .",
    "firstly @xmath74 and @xmath53 were evaluated using eqs .",
    "( [ rchip ] ) and ( [ imchip ] ) for a chosen value of @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the corresponding values of @xmath67 and @xmath82 were then obtained by fitting the above susceptibility data with eqs .",
    "( [ rchicd ] ) and ( [ imchicd ] ) of the cole - davidson model .",
    "this procedure was then repeated for a number of @xmath40 values in the range 0.1 to 0.5 , keeping @xmath39 constant .",
    "larger values of @xmath40 were not considered as they resulted in extremely broad log - normal distributions which are not of relevance in experiments .",
    "the above evaluation was then performed for three different values of @xmath10 .",
    "the results obtained are plotted in figure 4 on a semi - logarithmic scale .",
    "the solid lines follow the equation : @xmath86 the parameters @xmath87 and @xmath88 in each case are obtained from the best fits of the above equation to the evaluated data .",
    "we find that @xmath88 @xmath43 2.45@xmath890.05 and is independent of @xmath10 .",
    "we also find that eq .",
    "( [ betasigma ] ) and the parameter @xmath88 is unaffected by @xmath39 , which was varied from 4 to 12 nm .",
    "we test the procedure for extracting particle - size distribution from the susceptibility data on maghemite nanoparticle suspensions provided in reference @xcite . from the cole - cole plots of this data",
    ", we evaluated the best - fit values of @xmath67 and @xmath82 .",
    "these were found to be @xmath90 s and 0.44 respectively .",
    "the average core radius @xmath39 , evaluated from @xmath67 using eq .",
    "( [ neel ] ) , was found to be 4.2 @xmath28 .",
    "the value of @xmath40 characterizing the spread of the log - normal distribution was then obtained using eq .",
    "( [ betasigma ] ) and was found to be 0.36 .",
    "the reconstructed particle - size distribution is shown in figure 5 .",
    "the particle - size distribution obtained using tem measurements has also been provided in the figure for comparisons . in general , we find that this procedure reproduces the original distributions rather well when the response function has one dominant peak , be it in the neel or the brownian relaxation regime .",
    "the properties of the magnetic fluid are greatly affected by the aggregation of particles ( inspite of surfactant coating ) due to the presence of attractive and repulsive interactions .",
    "it is hence instructive to consider the different interaction energies in mnp suspensions and understand their interplay which leads to the formation of aggregates or clusters of different sizes .",
    "the primary interaction energies in these systems are enumerated below @xcite :    1 .",
    "dipolar interaction : + as each particle is magnetized , the attractive dipole - dipole interaction could in principle force particle agglomeration . the dipolar interaction energy between two magnetic nanoparticles , each having a magnetic moment @xmath91 is given by : @xmath92 where @xmath72 is the center - to - center separation between the two nanoparticles and the permeability of free space @xmath93 @xmath43 @xmath94 @xmath95 . as the magnetic properties of the particles are affected by temperature , the dipolar interaction defined above is also temperature dependent .",
    "van der waal s interaction : + it arises spontaneously between neutral particles because of the fluctuating electric dipolar forces and is attractive in nature .",
    "hamaker calculated this interaction for identical spheres separated by a surface - to - surface distance @xmath96 to be : @xmath97 in the above equation , the hamaker constant @xmath98 .",
    "it should be noted that the @xmath99 dependence in the above equation indicates that infinite energy is required to separate a particle pair while a finite energy is required in its formation",
    ". therefore agglomeration of particles will occur as long as the hamaker constant has a finite value . as a result van der waal s interaction unlike dipolar interaction is unaffected by temperature .",
    "3 .   steric interaction : + the steric energy comes into play due to the presence of long chained surfactant molecules coating the particles .",
    "this mechanism prevents the particles from approaching very close to one another , thus preventing the van der waal s attraction to come into play .",
    "this repulsive interaction originates due to a compression of the surface - adsorbed surfactant molecules when the inter particle separation is smaller than two times the thickness of the surfactant layer . for a sufficient density of the surfactant layer , the repulsion can grow large enough to avoid the contact between the magnetic particles",
    "this repulsive energy for spherical particles has been calculated by papell and is given by the following form : @xmath100 in the above form , the young s modulus @xmath101 was assumed to be @xmath102 and @xmath103 is the diameter of the magnetic core of the particle .    .    apart from the above interaction energies , the thermal energy responsible for the brownian motion of the suspended particles also plays an important role in the aggregation dynamics .",
    "an appropriate value of temperature ( which depends on the size of the interacting particles ) is capable of preventing aggregation . in principle",
    ", this condition may be expressed as a comparison between the attractive energy with the thermal energy of the two particles which yields a numerical value of the core radius @xmath6 at which this could happen .",
    "we expect the thermal degrees of freedom , in conjunction with steric repulsion , to not only hamper the aggregation process but also remove particles from the parent cluster leading to its fragmentation .    at this juncture",
    "we define a parameter @xmath104 as the ratio of energies leading to aggregation to those which lead to fragmentation follows : @xmath105 it is expected that the distribution of cluster sizes and the mean cluster size will be governed by the ratio @xmath104 . in the following subsection ,",
    "we present a model which incorporates the competing mechanisms of aggregation and fragmentation .",
    "the formulation introduced by smoluchowski is especially useful to model a suspension of magnetic nanoparticles @xcite . to begin with , we assume that the suspension contains @xmath106 identical , single particles executing brownian motion .",
    "the later leads to aggregation of two particles if they come within an appropriate range of one another and the net interaction between them is attractive .",
    "the resulting cluster of size two also executes brownian motion , but with a reduced diffusion rate till it encounters a particle or a cluster of particles .",
    "the process goes on and eventually a single large cluster comprising of all the @xmath106 particles is formed . such a cluster",
    "is usually reffered to as an infinite aggregate . in most useful suspensions",
    "however there is a distribution of clusters of varying sizes . as discussed in the preceding subsection",
    ", the combined effects of thermal energy and inter - particle repulsion can introduce fragmentation in the cluster dynamics thereby preventing the formation of large aggregates .",
    "we thus include this additional mechanism in the rate equations which describe the evolution of clusters .",
    "let @xmath107 denote the number of clusters containing @xmath108 particles at time t. the time evolution of @xmath107 is governed by the following rate equations : @xmath109 in the above equation the @xmath110 and @xmath111 are the aggregation and fragmentation kernels respectively whose forms are specified below .",
    "the aggregation kernel describes the coalescence of a cluster containing @xmath112 particles with another containing @xmath113 particles to yield a larger aggregate comprising of @xmath108 @xmath43 @xmath114 particles .",
    "it is assumed to have a mass - dependent form defined by @xmath110 @xmath43 @xmath115 to take into account the reduced mobility of large clusters .",
    "a value of @xmath91 @xmath43 0 implies a mass - independent mobility , i.e. , clusters of all sizes diffuse with the same ease .",
    "a non - zero values of @xmath91 results in a slower mobility of larger clusters and consequently a slower growth rate of clusters . in the limit of @xmath116 ,",
    "only monomers are mobile .",
    "the choice of @xmath91 is dictated by the experimental parameters as we shall see in a short while .",
    "the fragmentation kernel @xmath111 describes the loss of a particle from the parent cluster and can also be assumed to have a mass - dependent form defined by @xmath111= @xmath117 . in our studies",
    "however , we have set @xmath118 @xmath43 0 to reduce the number of parameters in the model . the parameters",
    "@xmath119 and @xmath54 define the relative strength of the aggregation and fragmentation processes .",

    "we have then studied the effect of polydispersity , an inherent feature of all samples on the response characteristics . these exhibit significant changes due to the strong dependence of relaxation times on particle sizes .",
    "the primary effect is the broadening of response functions and in some cases the later exhibits a two peaked structure .",
    "we have also worked out a procedure to obtain the particle - size distribution from @xmath0 using cole - cole plots and the analysis of cole and davidson .",
    "this provides an alternative approach to tem analysis which is usually employed to obtain particle - size distributions .",

    "clustering of particles is inevitable in such suspensions .",
