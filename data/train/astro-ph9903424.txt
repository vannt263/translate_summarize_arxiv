    "the taxonomy of seyfert galaxies has expanded from the straightforward types 1 and 2 classification to include various intermediate ( 1.2 , 1.5 , 1.8 , and 1.9 ) types as well as type  3 or liners ( heckman 1980 ; filippenko 1996 ) .",
    "this system is primarily based on the strength of the broad permitted emission lines of the balmer series which are broad compared to the width of the emission lines from forbidden atomic transitions such as [ ] @xmath8 .",
    "there are now reasons to believe that what we are seeing is the result of a viewing angle dependence of optically thick material that obscures the broad emission line region ( blr ) formed in a toroidal distribution .",
    "the observation of broad balmer lines in the polarized optical spectra , broad infrared emission lines of the paschen series , and the large column densities measured in the x - ray spectra of some type 2 seyferts lend support to what has become a unified model of seyfert galaxies .    x - ray observations give a direct measure of the column density of line - of - sight material absorbing the continuum emission of the agn .",
    "comparison between the variations of the hard x - ray continuum and the fe k@xmath1 fluorescence emission line , produced by the transmission of x - rays through the absorbing material , allow an estimate of the location of the torus to be made .",
    "an example of this was seen in the x - ray observations of the type 1.9 seyfert galaxy ngc  2992 ( weaver et al .",
    "1996 ) which showed a delay between the fe k@xmath1 emission line strength and the declining 2  10 kev continuum .",
    "the comparison of the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath1 emission lines to the measured column density in a sample of narrow line agn ( both type 2 and nelg @xmath9 type 1.8 and 1.9 ) observed by @xmath0 has shown that reprocessing by reflection and scattering can be also important ( turner et al . 1997ab ; 1998 ) .",
    "however these measurements did not indicate a location for the absorbing or reflecting medium because only a single epoch observation was presented for each object .",
    "examination of the long term variation in the hard x - ray ( 2    10  kev ) flux from type 2 seyfert galaxies has shown that changes by a factor of 2  3 are not unusual ( ueno 1997 ) and so we may observe a delay in the response of the fe k@xmath1 line to changes in the direct continuum .",
    "here we present multiple x - ray observations of two narrow line agn , the type 1.9/2 seyfert galaxy ngc  4388 and the type 1.9 seyfert galaxy eso  103g35 , to search for evidence of variations in the absorbing column , the 0.5  10 kev x - ray flux and fe k@xmath1 emission line over a period of @xmath10 2 years .",
    "the first type 2 seyfert galaxy to be unambiguously detected in hard x - rays was ngc  4388 , a nearly edge on spiral galaxy ( i @xmath11 , sb(s)b pec ) , that is the dominant source of hard x - rays in the virgo cluster ( helou et al .",
    "1981 ; hanson et al . 1990",
    "; takano & koyama 1991 ) . the low spectral resolution of the @xmath12 xrt and @xmath7 lac observations did not allow for a firm detection of any emission features in the spectrum of ngc  4388 .",
    "the @xmath12 spectrum of ngc  4388 could be modeled as a fairly flat ( @xmath13 ) power law continuum absorbed by a large column density of cold gas ( @xmath14 @xmath3 ; hanson et al .",
    "the h@xmath1/h@xmath15 emission line ratio of the nuclear emission implies an extinction of @xmath16 to 1.5 , equivalent to a column @xmath17 @xmath3 ( assuming a standard gas to dust ratio ) .",
    "infrared spectroscopy has also revealed a strong 9.7@xmath18 m absorption feature in the spectrum of the nucleus of ngc  4388 consistent with the presence of large amounts of obscuring material ( roche et al .",
    "1991 ) .",
    "high resolution spectra of the nuclear emission shows evidence of broad h@xmath1 emission ( fwzi  @xmath19  km  s@xmath20 , filippenko & sargent 1985 ) although at a much weaker level than that claimed by stauffer ( 1982 ) .",
    "this , along with the detection of broad h@xmath1 emission from a region a few kpc from the nucleus ( shields & filippenko 1988 ; 1996 ) , results in a re - classification of ngc  4388 as an intermediate type 1.9 seyfert galaxy .",
    "however , no broad pa@xmath15 emission has been detected at either the nucleus of ngc  4388 ( ruiz , rieke , & schmidt 1994 ; goodrich , veilleux , & hill 1994 ) or the off - nuclear position where broad h@xmath1 was detected ( blanco , ward , & wright 1990 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry of ngc  4388 has also failed to conclusively reveal broad emission lines in polarized light ( young et al .",
    "1996 ) and the continuum polarization is low ( @xmath21% ) , most likely arising in dusty interstellar medium of the host galaxy ( kay 1994 ) .    the virgo cluster has been the target of a dozen observations by the @xmath0 satellite between 1993 and 1995 , ngc  4388 appeared in the field of view of three of them . here",
    "we present for the first time the result from a targeted observation of ngc  4388 taken in 1995 .",
    "we also reanalyze one of the serendipitous 1993 observations previously reported by iwasawa et al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter i97 ) .",
    "this is combined with a nearly simultaneous @xmath22 pspc observation to assist in the determination of the nature of the soft x - ray emission from ngc  4388 .",
    "we also search for the presence of hard x - ray reprocessing by studying a @xmath23 osse observation taken 1 month after the 1993 @xmath22 and @xmath0 observations .",
    "the @xmath24  a2 hard x - ray source 1h  1832653 was identified with the s0/sa type galaxy eso  103g35 ( z = 0.01329 ) by phillips et al .",
    "( 1979 ) who classified the agn as a type 1.9 seyfert due to the weakness of the h@xmath15 emission line and the presence of a broad h@xmath1 line with fwzi 6000 km s@xmath20 .",
    "examination of the eso ( b ) atlas shows that the host galaxy has an inclination angle of @xmath25 ( kirkahos & steiner 1990 ) .",
    "a deep 9.7@xmath18 m absorption feature implies a substantial optical depth at 10@xmath18 m toward the emitting source ( roche et al .",
    "1991 ) and eso  103g35 is also seen to host an h@xmath26o megamaser ( braatz , wilson , & henkel 1996 ) . a large absorbing column ( @xmath27 @xmath3 )",
    "was directly observed in @xmath28 and @xmath7 observations ( turner & pounds 1989 ; warwick et al .",
    "the @xmath28 observations of eso  103g35 indicated a possible variation in the column density over a period of four months interpreted as due to motion of material in the blr across the line - of - sight to the continuum source ( warwick , pounds , & turner 1988 ) .",
    "we present three @xmath0 observations of eso  103g35 ; note however that the 1994 observation was previously reported in turner et al .",
    "( 1997a ) .",
    "the @xmath0 observations of ngc  4388 and eso  103g35 examined here were obtained from the heasarc archives as well as proprietary data and analyzed using the xselect and xspec software packages ( arnaud 1996 ) .",
    "tables 1a and 1b give a log of the @xmath0 observations examined in this paper along with the screening criteria used to select useful events .",
    "standard background cleaning was applied to remove events due to high - energy particles , and the light curves were examined for data dropout and periods of high background level .",
    "hot and flickering pixels were removed from the solid  state imaging spectrometer ( sis ) data .",
    "the faint mode data were converted to bright2 mode after correction for dark frame error and echo effect .",
    "the sis detectors have suffered a steady degradation since launch due to the harsh radiation environment in orbit .",
    "there are two major effects , residual dark distribution ( rdd ) and non - uniform charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) , both of which impair the ccd chips in the sis instruments ( see dotani et al .",
    "1995 ; 1996 for details ) .",
    "these effects can be corrected for in the extraction of the events from the detectors , but only the 1995 ngc  4388 and 1996 eso  103g35 data were corrected for rdd as the effect is not significant in observations taken before 1995 .",
    "note that only the 2-ccd mode data from the 1993 observation of ngc  4388 is examined here as the few events which we were able to extract from the 4-ccd mode data did not significantly improve the signal - to - noise ratio of the data .",
    "ngc  4388 is in the field of view of both the gas imaging spectrometer ( gis ) and the sis detectors in only one of the 1993 @xmath0 observations ( of ngc  4374 on 4 july 1993 , hereafter the 1993b observation ) and this observation is examined in detail here .",
    "the distribution of x - ray events from ngc  4388 on the detectors during the remaining serendipitous observation ( of ngc  4406 on 3  4 july 1993 , hereafter the 1993a observation ) is somewhat uncertain and the extreme off - axis position ( @xmath29 ) of ngc  4388 in the gis 2 data and its proximity to the calibration source in the gis 3 data may give spurious results .",
    "the choice of areas on the gis and sis detectors to represent an accurate background for the observations of ngc  4388 is problematic as this galaxy lies 1.3@xmath30 from m87 and has two giant elliptical galaxies , ngc  4374 ( m84 ) and ngc  4406 ( m86 ) , within 18@xmath31 .",
    "this creates a complicated mosaic of x - ray emission across the detectors and the extraction regions must be chosen with care to collect as many events due to the agn as possible but also to account correctly for variations in the intensity of the background thermal x - ray emission that is known to exhibit a variety of temperatures ( takano et al .",
    "1989 ; awaki et al .",
    "for this reason the use of the @xmath0 blank sky observations for background regions is unsuitable even though ngc  4388 lies at high galactic latitude ( @xmath32 ) .",
    "although ngc  4388 is not a bright x - ray source , extraction regions 60.1 cm in radius were used , as recommended for gis observations of bright point sources .",
    "the background extraction region was chosen to be an annulus around this circle out to a radius of 8 , different from those employed by i97 .",
    "however , we find that the background spectra from the regions chosen by i97 and those used here are essentially identical .",
    "the extraction regions chosen for the sis observations of ngc  4388 are polygons lying within the chip boundaries , approximating circular regions of radius 40.1 cm to 50.1 cm as recommended for sis observations of point sources ( day et al .",
    "the background was taken from regions around the source extraction region out to the edge of the same chip but within a radius of @xmath10 8 . the standard technique for background subtraction of using regions around the edge of the same chip that the target is placed on",
    "was found not to be suitable for the observations of ngc  4388 due to the spatially variable nature of the soft x - ray emission from the virgo cluster .",
    "the radial profile of the x - ray emission from ngc  4388 was investigated in the @xmath0 observations in both soft x - ray ( 0.5 - 3.0 kev ) and hard x - ray ( 3.0 - 10.0 kev ) bands ; however no indication of extended emission was found .",
    "this is not surprising as the emission observed in the 1991 @xmath22 hri observation that extends out to @xmath33 ( matt et al .",
    "1994 ) and the 20.2 cm x - ray lobe seen in the 1993 pspc observation ( colbert et al .",
    "1998 ) would be difficult to detect with the @xmath0 instruments providing @xmath34 total events above background during the observations .",
    "eso  103g35 was observed by @xmath0 on three occasions , september 1994 , september 1995 , and march 1996 ( see table 1b ) .",
    "the standard extraction region of a circle with a radius 60.1 cm for the target events and an annulus out to 80.2 cm for the background events were used for the gis observations of eso  103g35 . for the sis observations of eso  103g35",
    "the target events were taken from circular regions of 40.1 cm radius centered on eso  103g35 , except for the 1996 sis 1 data which were extracted from a @xmath35 box as eso  103g35 was too close to the edge of the chip for a circular extraction region to be used .",
    "background events were taken from rectangular regions around the edge of the same chip with approximately the same area as the extraction regions , avoiding a regions closer than @xmath10 5.5 to the target .",
    "the radial profile of all the @xmath0 observations of eso  103g35 were consistent with a point source for events above 2 kev , there being too few events below that energy to make a useful comparison .",
    "the data from the gis and sis instruments were rebinned so that each spectral channel contained at least 20 counts so that chi - square statistics are applicable for spectral fitting .",
    "standard response files were used for the gis data and response matrices were created for each sis instrument .",
    "ancillary files for both gis and sis data were also created using ftools packages .",
    "note that the gis and sis data ( both 2 ccd and 4 ccd ) are modeled simultaneously including a parameter needed to account for minor differences in the normalizations of the gis and sis instruments .",
    "ngc  4388 has appeared in two @xmath22 pspc observations ; however the first of these ( the december 1991 observation of ngc  4406 ) placed ngc  4388 in a region on the detector shadowed by the pspc window support structure and therefore this observation was not analyzed .",
    "it was fortunate that a targeted @xmath22 pspc observation of ngc  4388 was made during the 1993 @xmath0 observation .",
    "combining the @xmath22 and @xmath0 spectra extends the band pass to lower energies where the sensitivity of the @xmath0 instruments is rapidly declining .",
    "an analysis of the pspc spectrum ( rush & malkan 1996 ) and the image ( colbert et al .",
    "1998 ) is available and so we shall only describe the results from a simultaneous fitting of the @xmath22 and @xmath0 data (  3.8 ) .",
    "the @xmath22 pspc data were extracted in the standard manner ( turner 1996 ) with periods of high background level excluded .",
    "the background subtracted count rate between 0.1 and 2.0 kev was 0.045  s@xmath20 for a total exposure of 11.65  ks .",
    "a @xmath22 pspc observation of eso  103g35 was performed between 31  march and 12  april 1993 ( colbert et al . 1998 ) with the target 4.@xmath316 off - axis .",
    "a standard extraction aperture of radius @xmath36 was used .",
    "a nearby bright source was excluded from the background region , chosen to be an annulus of outer radius 4 .",
    "the final exposure time , after excluding periods of high background , is 16.3  ks giving a 0.1    2.0",
    "kev background subtracted count rate of @xmath37  s@xmath20 .",
    "there are two faint point sources , with pspc count rates of @xmath38  s@xmath20 , within 60.1 cm of the position of es0  103g35 and these will have contaminated the soft x - ray events observed with the @xmath0 instruments .",
    "the pspc spectra of these two sources can be fitted with a blackbody model of temperature 0.12 and 0.14 kev .",
    "the light curves of all the @xmath0 and @xmath22 observations of ngc  4388 and eso  103g35 were examined for evidence of short term x - ray variability .",
    "no significant variability was observed in the background - subtracted events due to ngc  4388 during a 1.75 day @xmath22 hri observation in december 1991 or during the 1993 @xmath22 pspc observation that spanned 16 days . a comparison between gis detector areas centered on the position of ngc  4388 and various regions on the detector during the 1993 @xmath0 observations showed no significant variability of events due to ngc  4388 sampled on time - scales from minutes to days .",
    "the x - ray events were also split into two broad energy bands but no variability was discovered in either the soft ( @xmath39 kev ) or hard x - ray events ( @xmath40 kev ) during the observations .",
    "the events from both the gis and sis instruments during the 1993b and 1995 observations were summed and the background events subtracted .",
    "the energy range of the events were also restricted to be above 2 kev , where the flux from the agn dominates over the virgo cluster emission , and below the energy where ngc  4388 is detected above the background level ( 10 kev for the gis and 9 kev for the sis observations ) .",
    "the variations are statistically significant at the 99% level only for the 1995 observations ; however the uncertainties in the count rates are large and the gis and sis detector variations do not match very well .",
    "thus we can not confirm that any variations in x - ray emission occurred on a time - scale of days during the @xmath22 and @xmath0 observations of ngc  4388 .",
    "statistically significant variations in count rate were observed during all the @xmath0 observations of eso  103g35 .",
    "however we only claim significant variability for the 1996 observation where @xmath41 ( sis ) = 7.2 and @xmath41 ( gis ) = 5.5 ( @xmath42 = 6 ) compared to a constant source . in this observation the signal to noise is highest and the variations in count rate are similar in both the gis and sis detectors and so we present this light - curve in figure 1 .",
    "for each observation a number of different continuum models were applied to the data , and for each case the chi - square statistic of the goodness of fit along with the number of degrees of freedom in the model fit are quoted ( the 1993b data followed by 1995 ) .",
    "the f - test probability statistic ( bevington & robinson 1992 ) is also quoted where different models are compared . an absorbed power law model ( 1pl )",
    "can be rejected for all the observations at @xmath43% level ( @xmath44 = 447.2/329 ; 873.2/541 ) .",
    "the residuals from this fit to the sis data are presented in figure 2 . immediately obvious in all",
    "the @xmath0 spectra is a strong emission line near 6.4 kev and a soft x - ray excess below 3 kev .",
    "the poor statistics seen in the spectra below 3 kev is a consequence of the subtraction of the high background flux from the virgo cluster whose thermal spectrum peaks around 1 kev .",
    "when the soft x - ray emission was modeled as an unabsorbed power law continuum ( 2pl ) , it was found that the model fit improved significantly ( 393.9/327 , @xmath45 ; 629.0/539 , @xmath46 ) .",
    "no improvement was made over the 2pl model if instead a raymond - smith thermal plasma emission model ( raymond & smith 1977 ) is added to an absorbed power law ( rs+pl ) to model the soft x - ray emission .",
    "however the model used by i97 included both thermal emission and unabsorbed power law components ( rs+2pl ) , and when this model is applied to the data the chi - square values of the residuals are significantly reduced in both observations ( @xmath47/@xmath48 9.6/2 ; 25.0/2 ) . when the photon indices of the power law components are then constrained to be the same , the model fit did not significantly degrade or improve .",
    "there was also no improvement when each continuum component was associated with a separate column of absorbing material and it was found that the columns absorbing the thermal and the ( less absorbed ) power law components were consistent with that found in the rs+2pl model .",
    "models that included 2 thermal components ( raymond - smith and blackbody or 2 raymond - smith components ) in addition to a heavily absorbed power law also provided a reasonable fit to the data ( 396.7/322 ; 641.7/534 ) .",
    "however the temperature of the second thermal component was @xmath10 10 kev and could not be constrained and so we rejected this model .",
    "we agree then with i97 that the rs+2pl model proves a satisfactory description of the continuum emission seen in the @xmath0 observations of ngc  4388 .",
    "the addition of a gaussian emission feature near 6.4 kev also improves upon the rs+2pl model fit significantly ( 320.6/321 @xmath45 ; 542.3/533 @xmath49 ) for both observations and will be discussed in  3.4 below .",
    "table 2a presents the rs+2pl models along with the 90% error estimate for 4 interesting parameters ( ip ) .",
    "these models , unfolded from the instrumental response , are shown in figure 3 along with the ratio of the data to the folded model .",
    "the confidence contours for the parameters in the rs+2pl models fitted simultaneously to the sis and gis data in each observation are presented in figure 4 , where the contour levels are @xmath47 at 68% , 90% , and 99% levels for 4 ip ( @xmath47 4.72 , 7.78 , and 13.3 respectively ) except for fig .",
    "4f where the contours are @xmath47 for 2ip .",
    "this is a departure from the standard reporting of error estimates for modeling of x - ray spectra where errors based on 1 or 2 ip are usually quoted .",
    "however , in complicated , multi - component models , each continuum model parameter is sensitive to changes in other parameters and so the @xmath47 values of more ip should be quoted to give a more legitimate estimate of the errors in the model ( yaqoob 1998 ) . as an example",
    ", the error estimate for the photon index includes the photon index , the normalizations of both power law components and the absorbing column as interesting parameters , the other parameters being frozen at their best fit values .",
    "the total fluxes between 0.5 and 10.0 kev for these models are @xmath50 = ( 1.42 , 0.68 ) @xmath51 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath20 ( 1993 , 1995 respectively ) . the power law continuum models shown in table 2a give an absorption corrected 2  10 kev luminosity for ngc  4388 of @xmath52 = ( 2.78 , 1.28 ) @xmath53 ergs s@xmath20 ( 1993 , 1995 respectively ) for a distance to the virgo cluster of 27 mpc ( fabbiano , kim , & trinchieri 1992 ) .",
    "the residuals from fitting an absorbed power law to the @xmath0 observations of eso  103g35 are presented in figure 5 .",
    "residuals around 6 kev and below 3 kev can be seen and there is also a feature near 0.9 kev in the 1994 and 1996 data that may be an emission line , or blend of lines .",
    "the absorbed power law model is a poor description of the observations ; the @xmath44 for 1994 , 1995 and 1996 respectively are 320.2/280 , 105.9/98 and 615.6/532 .",
    "the addition of a gaussian emission line near 6.4 kev to the absorbed power law significantly improves the fit in all the observations ( 274.7/277,0.1 cm 82.8/95 and 575.6/529 ; @xmath54 0.1 cm and 0.1 cm @xmath55 ) and is discussed in detail below (  3.4 ) .",
    "a significant improvement is made in the 1994 and 1996 observations when the soft x - ray residuals are accounted for with the addition of a second ( less absorbed ) power law ( 262.7/275 , @xmath56 and 534.0/527 , @xmath57 ) there are very few soft x - ray counts in the 1995 observation and so the improvement in adding a second power law is not significant ( 78.2/93 , @xmath58 ) but for consistency we include the second power law in the analysis of the 1995 observation .",
    "the contaminating sources seen in the @xmath22 pspc observation (  2.2 ) should have provided at least twice as many soft x - ray events than those observed during the @xmath0 observations .",
    "one of these sources can be identified with a @xmath59 star with a proper motion of @xmath60 arcsec yr@xmath20 ( wroblewski & torres 1994 ) , and the other remains unidentified . the flux from the pspc observation of the weak , unresolved nuclear soft x - ray source identified with eso  103g35 is consistent with that seen during the 1994 @xmath0 observation , although slightly low compared to that observed in the 1996 observation .",
    "there are so few soft x - ray events accumulated during the @xmath0 observations that a model that combines thermal and power law emission to describe the flux below 2.5 kev does not allow the parameters to be meaningfully constrained .",
    "a model where the flux below 3 kev is due to thermal emission alone does not improve on the two power law model ( 261.3/273 , 77.7/91 and 535.3/525 ) and the low signal to noise does not allow a good constraint of the temperature of this component to be made ( e.g. @xmath61 kev ) .",
    "we therefore parameterize the soft x - ray emission with a power law alone noting that a proportion of the flux may be due to contaminating sources .",
    "the parameters for the two power law plus gaussian emission line model are presented in table 2b , the model unfolded from the instrumental response and the data to model ratio are shown in figure  6 , and the @xmath62 confidence contours of the model fitted simultaneously to the gis and sis data in each observation are shown in figure 7 . the total 2    10",

    "the possibility of ` excess ' absorption at 7 kev , i.e. more than that required for the measured absorbing column , was investigated . a model with absorption by neutral material of solar metalicity",
    "was applied to the data but with the fe abundance set to zero in order to measure the strength of the absorption edge .",
    "it was found that the presence of an edge due to _ neutral _ 0.1 cm iron ( near 7 kev ) is required ( i.e. significantly improves the model fit ) in all the @xmath0 observations of ngc  4388 and eso  103g35 .",

    "@xmath143 the high column density material in the leaky - absorber model for the type 2 seyfert galaxy iras 045757537 was interpreted as arising in blr clouds ( vignali et  al .",
    "however in that case the covering fraction was significantly lower ( 36% ) than seen in ngc  4388 (  3.5 and table 3 ) and much closer to the 10% value normally associated with the blr in agn .",
    "what we may be seeing in ngc  4388 is the presence of clumping in a unified model type torus , although we can not rule out the ism of the host galaxy of ngc  4388 as the location of the absorbing material because the stellar disk of ngc  4388 has a high inclination to the line of sight .",
    "the optical depth required to account for the strength of the fe k@xmath1 emission line in ngc 4388 ( @xmath145 ) is also at the upper limit of the 99% error margin on the measured value as can be seen in fig .",
    "similarly we can interpret the presence of a less absorbed power law continuum in ngc 4388 as evidence that the covering fraction of the lower column density absorber is less than unity ( 90  95% ) , although this is difficult to reconcile with a model of absorption in the ism .",
    "the leaky - absorber model applied to the @xmath0 spectra of eso  103g35 causes the power law continuum to become rather steep ( @xmath146 ) and , although the presence of a larger absorbing column will reconcile the high equivalent width of the fe k@xmath1 emission line seen in the 1994 spectrum , it predicts an equivalent width higher than is seen in the 1996 spectrum .",
    "this model also does not seem to agree with the variability behavior of the fe k@xmath1 emission line and fe k edge .",
    "the optical depth of the fe k edge is seen to increase between the observations and this implies that the strength of the fe k@xmath1 emission line should have increased but the opposite behavior is seen ( figs . 8 and 11 ) .      in many type 1 seyfert galaxies",
    "strong fe  k@xmath1 emission lines are observed , some with complex profiles and large equivalent widths ( nandra et  al .",
    "the interpretation is that of fluorescence from an accretion disk , however the material in this case is close to ( or coincident with ) the source of the continuum photons and so no lag in line response is expected ( e.g. mcg 523 - 16 , weaver , krolik , & pier 1998 ; nandra et  al .",
    "turner et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) found evidence for broad fe k@xmath1 line emission in up to a third of their sample of narrow - line agn which they modeled as emission from an accretion disk viewed ` pole - on ' ( i.e. similar to emission seen in type 1 agn ) .",

    "( 1998 ) have also been successfully modeled by weaver & reynolds ( 1998 ) with a combination of a broad component from an accretion disk viewed at an inclination angle of @xmath149 and a narrow unresolved component .",
    "this illustrates the difficulty of identifying broad emission features on heavily absorbed power law spectra with low signal - to - noise data .    in type 2 seyfert galaxies where the power law continuum slope is very flat and the observed equivalent widths of the fe k@xmath1 line",
    "are extremely large , a reflection continuum is thought to be the dominant component in the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "this is the case for ngc  1068 , where @xmath0 observations have revealed a complex blend of neutral and ionized fe k@xmath1 emission lines with equivalent widths @xmath150 kev ( ueno et  al .",
    "1994 ) and in the circinus galaxy , ngc  6552 , and ngc  7674 , where equivalent widths larger than 1 kev are also seen ( matt et  al . 1996",
    "; reynolds et  al .",
    "1994 ; malaguti et  al .",
    "1998 respectively ) .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a reflection component will increase the observed strength of the fe k@xmath1 emission lines as well as cause a flattening of the power law continuum , although a flat hard x - ray spectral slope does not necessarily require a dominant reflection component , as is the case for ngc  5252 ( cappi et  al .",
    "1996 ) . in this type 2 seyfert galaxy",
    "the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath1 emission line is very low ( @xmath10 100 ev ) , and although the combination of a partially covered power law continuum and a reflection component can account for the flat spectrum ( @xmath151 ) , the model predicts an emission line of equivalent width @xmath10 400 ev , much larger than is observed .",
    "this situation may also be relevant for ngc  7582 where a very flat hard x - ray power law continuum is identified ( @xmath152 ) absorbed by a column @xmath153 @xmath3 ( schachter et  al .",
    "however only an upper limit of a few 100 ev could be placed on the equivalent width of an fe k@xmath1 line and so no reflection continuum is likely to be present .",
    "the intermediate strength fe k@xmath1 emission line observed in ngc  4388 may then indicate that a reflection component is present but does not dominate the hard x - ray continuum .",
    "the combined @xmath0 and osse spectrum of ngc  4388 is also similar to that of ngc 4507 and ngc 7172 where osse observations combined with @xmath7 and @xmath0 observations ( respectively ) of these agn do not require a reflection component and can be fitted with exponentially cut off power law continua ( bassani et  al .",
    "1995 ; ryde et  al .",
    "although both of these type 2 seyfert galaxies have a heavily absorbed flat power law continuum , the fe k@xmath1 emission line equivalent widths of @xmath10 300 and 100 ev respectively are consistent with fluorescence through the line of sight absorbing columns ( comastri et  al .",
    "1998 ; guainazzi et  al . 1998 ) and so no reflection component is required .",
    "the @xmath0 observations of ngc  7172 separated by one year also showed that while the continuum flux declined by a factor of 34 the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath1 line remained the same ( guainazzi et  al .",
    "this is similar to the behavior seen in the @xmath0 observations of ngc  4388 presented here",
    ".    for the @xmath7 observations of eso  103g35 , smith & done ( 1996 ) find that a model with a reflection component is as good a fit as the ionized absorption model .",
    "the reflection model required that @xmath154 , @xmath155(@xmath156 ) @xmath139 @xmath3 , @xmath157 , with an fe k@xmath1 equivalent width of @xmath158 ev . when a reflection model was applied to the 1996 @xmath0 spectrum",
    "a similar result was obtained with no improvement over the model presented in table 2b ( @xmath62/@xmath93 = 532.6/524 ) however , the reflection model parameters could not be constrained due to the limit of the bandpass of the @xmath0 instruments .",
    "the lower equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath1 emission line seen during 1996 @xmath0 observation of eso  103g35 does not require a reflection component and can be accounted for by line of sight fluorescence in material with the measured column density alone .",
    "we conclude that the @xmath0 observations of both ngc  4388 and eso  103g35 do not require a reflection component .    * note added in proof . *",
    "a stronger constraint is found from the october 1996 and 1997 bepposax observations of eso  103g35 where a reflection component is indicated in a spectrum that extends up to @xmath10 200 kev ( wilkes et  al .",
    "1999 , in preparation ) .",
    "significant low energy emission lines identified with elements lighter than iron are also present in the spectra of reflection dominated seyfert galaxies as predicted in models of reflection from cold material ( reynolds et  al . 1994 ; netzer et  al .",
    "if a reflection component were strong in the x - ray spectra of either ngc  4388 or eso  103g35 then low energy emission features may also be present .",
    "determination of such features in the spectrum of ngc  4388 is complicated by the extended thermal emission seen in the @xmath22 hri observation ( matt et  al .",
    "the model of the combined @xmath22 pspc and @xmath0 spectrum of ngc  4388 gives a soft x - ray ( 0.2  4.0 kev ) flux of @xmath159 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath20 and this is consistent with the total fluxes seen in the 1991 hri observation of ( 6.75 @xmath5 0.72 ) @xmath160 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath20 and in the 1978 @xmath161 ipc observation of @xmath162 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath20 , ( matt et  al .",
    "1994 ; fabbiano , et  al . 1992 ) .",
    "the radial profile of the soft x - ray emission , observed by the hri to extend out to @xmath10 4.5 kpc , suggests that @xmath10 20% of this flux is from a nuclear component within a radius 1.5 kpc .",
    "the expected 2  4 kev luminosity from the host spiral galaxy of the agn in ngc  4388 is @xmath163 erg s@xmath20 , scaling from the b - band luminosity ( fabbiano et  al .",
    "combined with the observed kiloparsec - scale emission ( colbert et  al .",
    "1998 ) this can fully account for the thermal emission observed in the @xmath0 spectra .",
    "netzer et  al .",
    "( 1998 ) have modeled emission features below 3 kev in the 1993 @xmath0 spectrum of ngc  4388 as due to a scattering process , however these features may be due to the thermal component .",
    "the addition of gaussian emission lines to the spectrum between 1.5 and 3.0 kev does not improve the chi - square residuals significantly and a scattered continuum can not explain the nature of the bulk of the soft x - ray emission seen in ngc  4388 .",
    "the temperature of the thermal components measured in the combined @xmath164 observation are too cool to be identified with a typical soft x - ray spectrum from a starburst disk ( ptak 1997 ) or ram pressure stripped hot gas ( e.g. irwin & sarazin 1996 ; hwang & sarazin 1996 ) . the combined emission from a collection of lmxb s in the bulge of ngc  4388 may prove to be the most straightforward explanation of the nature of the extended soft x - ray emission ( irwin & sarazin 1998 ) .",
    "the high spatial resolution of a @xmath165 observation should prove useful in distinguishing between the various possibilities .",
    "the @xmath22 pspc image of eso  103g35 shows only a weak unresolved nuclear soft x - ray source with a 0.5  2.0 kev flux of @xmath166 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath20 .",
    "this is consistent with the flux observed during the 1994 @xmath0 observation and this poses a problem .",
    "two nearby soft x - ray sources ( see  2.2 ) should have contaminated the gis observations with a combined soft x - ray flux at least 4 times larger than that observed from eso  103g35 during the pspc observation .",
    "although the soft x - ray flux appears to have risen slightly ( @xmath167 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath20 ) in the 1996 @xmath0 observation this is still too low and this may either indicate a problem with the cross calibration between the @xmath22 and @xmath0 instruments or variability of the contaminating sources .",
    "the increase in soft x - ray flux between the 1994 and 1996 observations may indicate an emergence of scattered or leaked nuclear flux that adds to the soft x - ray emission from the host galaxy and this could account for the rise in @xmath115/@xmath116 when the absorbed power law continuum also rose by a factor of 2 between the observations .",
    "there is also an emission feature near 0.9 kev in the spectrum of eso  103g35 ( fig .",
    "5 ) that may be similar to that seen in the soft x - ray spectra of ngc  4507 and mkn 3 ( comastri et  al .",
    "1998 ; griffiths et  al .",
    "this was interpreted as k@xmath1 recombination from a photoionized plasma in the case of ngc  4507 and this may also be the case for eso  103g35 .",
    "again , the capabilities of @xmath165 should resolve these possibilities .",
    "@xmath0 observations of two intermediate type seyfert galaxies ngc  4388 and eso  103g35 have been investigated and combined with @xmath22 pspc and @xmath23 osse observations .",
    "the @xmath0 spectrum of ngc 4388 can be described by a heavily absorbed flat power law continuum ( @xmath168 @xmath3 ) with a strong fe k@xmath1 emission line ( @xmath169 ev ) and soft x - ray thermal emission ( @xmath170 kev ) .",
    "the data also require the presence of a second , less absorbed , power law continuum at @xmath10 5% the flux level of the absorbed continuum .",
    "the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath1 emission line requires a larger column of absorbing material than is measured and the power law continuum is flatter than the canonical seyfert galaxy spectral slope .",
    "both of these properties are characteristic of reflection dominated type 2 seyfert galaxies .",
    "however the model fit is not improved by the inclusion of a compton reflection component , and there is also a concern that the modeling of the contemporary 1993 @xmath0 and osse observations do not appear to require a reflection continuum and can be fitted with a flat power law with an exponential cut off at high energies .",
    "ngc 4388 may be a case where there is a relatively small amount of reflection that manifests itself in a stronger than expected fe k@xmath1 emission line .",
    "ngc 4388 would then lie somewhere between ngc 5252 and the compton - thick type 2 seyfert galaxies in terms of the relative strength of the reflection component to the direct absorbed continuum .",
    "a leaky - absorber model is able to reconcile the strength of the fe k@xmath1 line and the ` low ' measured absorbing column . in this model",
    "there are two distinct absorbing media , the first has a column of @xmath171 @xmath3 and a covering fraction of @xmath10 70% and the second a lower column of @xmath172 @xmath3 .",
    "the strength of the fe k@xmath1 line is then fully accounted for ; however the observed optical depth at the fe k edge is somewhat smaller than expected from material with such a large column and the model is unable to improve statistically on the absorbed flat power law continuum model .",
    "the high column density gas component in the leaky - absorber model may reside in a hidden blr of ngc 4388 ( although the covering fraction is higher than normally associated with blr clouds ) a molecular torus surrounding the active nucleus , or the host galaxy ism .",
    "the @xmath0 observations are not sufficient to distinguish between these possibilities .",
    "the nature of the soft x - ray thermal emission seen in the @xmath0 observations of ngc 4388 is consistent with an identification with the extended emission seen in a @xmath22 hri observation .",
    "however , higher spatial and spectral resolution will be required to investigate the true nature of the extended emission .",
    "the spectrum of the intermediate type seyfert galaxy eso  103g35 can be well characterized by a heavily absorbed power law continuum of slope @xmath173 and @xmath174 @xmath3 .",
    "this continuum was observed to increase in flux by a factor of 2 between the @xmath0 observations separated by 18 months .",
    "however the equivalent width of the fe k@xmath1 emission line was seen to decrease between these observations implying that the line flux remained @xmath10 constant .",
    "the optical depth of the fe k edge is also observed to increase between the @xmath0 observations and the edge energy in the later observation indicates absorption from partially ionized iron .",
    "this matches the results of the 1998 and 1991 @xmath7 observations ( warwick et al .",
    "1993 ; smith & done 1996 ) .",
    "these , and the @xmath28 observations taken between 1983 and 1985 ( turner & pounds 1989 ) , also showed eso 103g35 to have a similar 2  10 kev luminosity to that seen in the 1996 @xmath0 observation .    a compton reflection component can be included in the continuum model but is not required on statistical grounds or needed to steepen the power law continuum to comply with the canonical seyfert galaxy spectral slope .",
    "it is also not required to reconcile the fe k@xmath1 emission line strength in the 1996 observation as this is consistent with fluorescence from partially ionized material with the measured column density .",
    "however the strength of the line in the 1994 @xmath0 observation indicates that an additional source of line photons is needed but a dual absorber model is inconsistent with the observed optical depth of the fe k edge .",
    "one ( highly speculative ) possibility is that the fe k@xmath1 emission line is responding to a higher x - ray flux level previous to the 1994 @xmath0 observation .    in terms of a unified model of seyfert galaxies",
    "these intermediate type agn exhibit an x - ray spectrum very similar to that seen in many type 2 seyfert galaxies but are certainly not reflection dominated and do not require the addition of a reflection continuum to explain the properties observed in the @xmath22 , @xmath0 and osse observations presented here .",

    "<S> the power law continuum flux has changed by a factor of 2 over a time - scale of @xmath4 years for both objects , declining in the case of ngc  4388 and rising in eso  103g35 .    </S>",
    "<S> no variation was observed in the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath1 line in the spectra of ngc  4388 , implying that the line flux declined with the continuum . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the strength of the line can not be accounted for by fluorescence in line - of - sight material with the measured column density unless a ` leaky - absorber ' model of the type favored for iras  045757537 is employed .    </S>",
    "<S> the equivalent width of the fe  k@xmath1 emission line is seen to decrease between the observations of eso  103g35 while the continuum flux increased . </S>",
    "<S> the 1996 observation of eso  103g35 can also be fitted with an absorption edge at 7.4 @xmath5 0.2 kev due to partially ionized iron , and when an ionized absorber model is fitted to the data it is found that the equivalent column of neutral hydrogen rises to @xmath6 @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> the fe k@xmath1 line flux can be accounted by fluorescence in this material alone and this model is also a good representation of the 1988 and 1991 @xmath7 observations . </S>",
    "<S> there is then no requirement for a reflection component in the @xmath0 spectra of eso  103g35 or ngc  4388 . </S>"
