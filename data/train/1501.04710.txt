    "long - range hamiltonian systems have many remarkable features @xcite , and one of them is existence of quasistationary states ( qsss ) in the way of relaxation to thermal equilibrium .",
    "the lifetime of qsss diverges with the number of particles consisting of the system @xcite , and hence qsss are solely observable in a system with large population like self - gravitating systems @xcite .",
    "dynamics of such a system is described by the vlasov equation , or the collisionless boltzmann equation , in the limit of large population @xcite , and the qsss , including thermal equilibrium states , are regarded as stable stationary solutions to the vlasov equation .",
    "the system slowly goes towards thermal equilibrium with large but finite population due to finite size effects @xcite .",
    "the qsss are observed not only in isolated systems , but also in systems under external fields .",
    "the initial qss , which may and may not be in thermal equilibrium , is driven to another qss by the external field , and the resulting qss is not necessarily in thermal equilibrium . as a result ,",
    "response to the external field may differ from one obtained by statistical mechanics .",
    "indeed , in the ferromagnetic model so - called hamiltonian mean - field ( hmf ) model @xcite , the critical exponents are obtained as @xmath0 @xcite and @xmath1 @xcite with the aid of a linear @xcite and a nonlinear @xcite response theories based on the vlasov description respectively , while statistical mechanics gives @xmath2 and @xmath3 . interestingly , with another exponent @xmath4 , the non - classical exponents satisfy the classical scaling relation @xmath5 , and have universality on initial reference families of qsss in a wide class of 1d mean - field models @xcite .",
    "the universality is derived under the assumption that the initial distribution functions depend on position and momentum only through the one - particle hamiltonian with referring to the jeans theorem @xcite .",
    "thus , the initial states are symmetric with respect to momentum .",
    "the symmetric initial states are also used in studies on nonequilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite , the core - halo description of qsss @xcite , nonequilibrium dynamics @xcite , and correlation and diffusion @xcite .",
    "see also refs.@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , asymmetric momentum distributions appear in beam - plasma systems ( see @xcite for instance ) , and are experimentally created in an ultracold plasma by optical pumping @xcite . in the hmf model ,",
    "such distributions are stationary even asymmetric , and it is , therefore , natural to ask the response in the asymmetric case for completing the response theory . the main purpose of this article is to investigate the linear response against asymptotically constant external field around spatially homogeneous but asymmetric distributions in the hmf model .",
    "it is worth noting that , despite its simpleness , the model shares similar dynamics with the free - electron laser @xcite and an anisotropic heisenberg model under classical spin dynamics @xcite .",
    "the hmf model consists of plane rotators like the xy spins , and the susceptibility tensor in the hmf model is of size @xmath6 corresponding to the @xmath7- and @xmath8-directions of the rotators . for symmetric homogeneous states , the susceptibility tensor is directly diagonalized and experiences a divergence at the critical point of the second order phase transition , which is dynamically interpreted as the stability threshold of the homogeneous states @xcite .",
    "we then ask the two questions for asymmetric momentum distributions with zero - means : is the susceptibility tensor symmetric and diagonalizable ?",
    "does the response diverge at the stability threshold ?",
    "we will answer these questions negatively .",
    "the non - diagonalizable response tensor implies that the external field for @xmath7-direction induces the magnetization for @xmath8-direction , and such a response is unavoidable even changing the coordinate .",
    "due to this non - diagonalizability , the predicted stat is not stationary , while the constant external field may drive the system to a stationary state asymptotically . in other words ,",
    "the non - diagonalizability provides an example of discrepancy between the asymptotic states by the linear dynamics and the full vlasov dynamics .",
    "the non - divergence of response suggests that @xmath9 and @xmath10 , and interestingly , the scaling relation @xmath11 holds , although @xmath12 might be not well defined since the spatially inhomogeneous stationary states must be symmetric by the jeans theorem @xcite .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "the hmf model and the linear responses are reviewed in sec.[sec : model - lrt ] .",

    "let @xmath210 be the hamiltonian vector field associated with the hamiltonian @xmath32 , , which is expressed as @xmath211 linearizing the vlasov equation around @xmath23 , we have the formal solution of perturbation @xmath212 as @xmath213 for the initial condition @xmath214 .",

    "we analytically continue the domain into the whole complex @xmath73 plane @xcite , and the resulting integral is written as @xmath236 where @xmath237 represents the principal value and is the normal integral for @xmath238 , and the second term including @xmath239 comes from the residues .",
    "we remark that the linear response is rewritten as @xmath240 if we perform integration by parts .",
    "the expression gives a similar form of the matrix @xmath234 with the correlation matrix @xmath241 as @xmath242 the matrix @xmath234 coincides with the correlation matrix @xmath241 as @xmath243 if @xmath23 is the maxwellian with the inverse temperature @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , the vlasov linear response coincides with the isothermal linear response in thermal equilibrium of the homogeneous phase @xcite .    in the text we concentrated on response to the external field with @xmath78 , but a general @xmath73 is also available .",

    "if this set @xmath252 includes the origin , then there exists a root of the dispersion relation @xmath112 on the upper half @xmath73 plane , and the root corresponds to an exponential growing mode from the definition of the laplace transform .",
    "to study the set @xmath252 , we investigate the boundary @xmath253 the boundary forms a closed curve , since @xmath254 as @xmath255 . in the limits of @xmath256 and @xmath257 , the curve approaches to @xmath258 from the positive and the negative imaginary sides respectively , since @xmath259 for @xmath260 and @xmath261 for @xmath262 , where @xmath184 is the maximum point of the single - peak distribution @xmath23 .",
