    "a dynamical system consists of a space @xmath5 endowed with some sort of structure , along with a @xmath10-action @xmath11 on the space for some group @xmath10 which preserves that structure .",
    "( for our purposes , @xmath10 will always be @xmath1 for some @xmath3 . )",
    "two examples are measurable dynamics , where @xmath5 is a probability space and @xmath12 is a measurable family of measure - preserving maps , and topological dynamics , where @xmath5 is a compact space and the @xmath12 are a continuous family of homeomorphisms . in each setup , when @xmath10 is an amenable group , ( a class of groups which includes @xmath13 ) there is an invaluable notion of entropy ; measure - theoretic , or metric , entropy in the setup of measurable dynamics , and topological entropy in the setup of topological dynamics .",
    "( we postpone rigorous definitions of these and other terms until section  [ defns ] . )",
    "these two notions are related by the famous variational principle , which says that the topological entropy of a topological dynamical system is the supremum of the measure - theoretic entropy over all @xmath11-invariant borel probability measures supported in it .",
    "if in addition the system is taken to be expansive , then this supremum is achieved for at least one measure , and any such measures are called measures of maximal entropy .",
    "a question of particular interest is when a system supports a unique measure of maximal entropy .",
    "this is closely related to the concept of a phase transition in statistical physics , which occurs when a system supports multiple gibbs measures .",
    "( see @xcite for a discussion of this relationship . )",
    "one particular class of topological dynamical systems for which measures of maximal entropy are well - understood are the one - dimensional shifts of finite type , or sfts .",
    "a one - dimensional shift of finite type is defined by a finite set @xmath0 , called the alphabet , and a finite set @xmath14 of forbidden words , or finite strings of letters from @xmath0 .",
    "the shift of finite type @xmath5 induced by @xmath14 then consists of all @xmath15 ( biinfinite strings of letters from @xmath0 ) which do not contain any of the forbidden words from @xmath14 .",
    "the space @xmath16 is endowed with the ( discrete ) product topology , and @xmath5 inherits the induced topology , under which it is a compact metrizable space .",
    "the dynamics of a shift of finite type are always given by the @xmath17-action of integer shifts on sequences in @xmath5 .",
    "any one - dimensional sft which satisfies a mild mixing condition called irreducibility has a unique measure of maximal entropy called the parry measure , which is just a markov chain with transition probabilities which can be algorithmically computed . for more on one - dimensional shifts of finite type and their measures of maximal entropy ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "even for these relatively simple models , things become more complicated when one moves to multiple dimensions .",
    "a @xmath3-dimensional sft is defined analogously to the one - dimensional case : specify the alphabet @xmath0 and finite set of forbidden ( @xmath3-dimensional ) finite configurations @xmath14 , and define a shift of finite type @xmath5 induced by @xmath14 to be the set of all @xmath18 ( infinite @xmath3-dimensional arrays of letters from @xmath0 ) which do not contain any of the configurations from @xmath14 .",
    "the dynamics are now given by the @xmath1-action of all shifts by vectors in @xmath1 .",
    "the easiest class of @xmath3-dimensional sfts to work with are the nearest neighbor sfts ; a @xmath3-dimensional sft @xmath5 is called nearest neighbor if @xmath14 consists entirely of adjacent pairs of letters , meaning that a point s membership in @xmath5 is based solely on rules about which pairs of adjacent letters are legal in each cardinal direction .",
    "a useful illustrative example of a nearest neighbor sft is the @xmath3-dimensional hard - core shift @xmath19 , defined by @xmath20 , and @xmath14 consisting of all configurations made of adjacent pairs of @xmath21s ( in each of the @xmath3 cardinal directions ) .",
    "then @xmath5 consists of all ways of assigning @xmath22 and @xmath21 to each site in @xmath1 which do not contain two adjacent @xmath21s .",
    "it turns out that many questions regarding @xmath3-dimensional sfts are extremely difficult or intractable .",
    "for instance , given only the alphabet @xmath0 and forbidden list @xmath14 , the question of whether or not @xmath5 is even nonempty is algorithmically undecidable ! ( @xcite , @xcite ) the structure of the set of measures of maximal entropy for multidimensional sfts is similarly murky ; it has been shown , for instance , that not even the strongest topological mixing properties , which are often enough to preclude some of the difficulties found in @xmath3-dimensional sfts , imply uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy . ( @xcite ) even when the measure of maximal entropy is unique , its structure is not necessarily as simple as in the one - dimensional case : it may be a bernoulli measure ( for instance in the case when the sft is all of @xmath23 ) , but there also exist examples where it is not even measure - theoretically weak mixing .",
    "( @xcite )    there are existing conditions in the literature which guarantee uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy , but many of these require quite strong restrictions on the adjacency rules defining @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , it was first shown in @xcite ( using the dobrushin uniqueness criterion ) that if the alphabet of a nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sft @xmath5 has a large enough proportion of letters called safe symbols , meaning that they may legally sit next to any letter of the alphabet in any direction , then @xmath5 has a unique measure of maximal entropy .",
    "it was later shown in @xcite that if all letters of the alphabet of a nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sft @xmath5 are only `` nearly safe , '' meaning that they can legally sit next to a large enough proportion of the letters in @xmath0 in any direction , then again @xmath5 has a unique measure of maximal entropy . both of these conditions , though useful , have two problems .",
    "firstly , they make reference to combinatorial information about the adjacency rules themselves , rather than more coarse topological information about the system itself . secondly , they are not very robust conditions ; if one takes an sft satisfying one of these conditions , and then adds a single letter to @xmath0 with new adjacency rules which do not allow it to sit next to a large portion of @xmath0 , then the conditions are no longer satisfied .    the main focus of this paper is to define a more robust , less combinatorial , condition on multidimensional sfts which guarantees existence of a unique measure of maximal entropy .",
    "our condition is similar in spirit to the previously mentioned one from @xcite , but rather than requiring every single letter of the alphabet to be `` nearly safe , '' i.e. allowed to sit next to a large proportion of the letters in @xmath0 in any direction , we require only that a large proportion of the letters of the alphabet are `` nearly safe '' in this sense . more specifically , call a nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sft @xmath24-full if there exists a subset of the alphabet of size at least @xmath25 consisting of letters which each have at least @xmath25 legal neighbors in each cardinal direction .",
    "our main result is that for small enough @xmath24 ( dependent on @xmath3 ) , every @xmath24-full nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sft @xmath5 has a unique measure of maximal entropy @xmath7 .",
    "we also prove several other desirable properties for such @xmath5 , such as showing that the topological entropy of @xmath5 is a computable number and that @xmath7 is measure - theoretically isomorphic to a bernoulli measure .",
    "somewhat surprisingly , it is easily shown that the @xmath24-fullness condition is implied by a condition which makes no mention of adjacency rules whatsoever , namely having topological entropy very close to the log of the alphabet size .",
    "specifically , for any @xmath24 , there exists @xmath26 for which any nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sft with entropy at least @xmath27 is @xmath24-full .",
    "this shows that all of the properties we prove for @xmath24-full nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sfts are shared by nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sfts with entropy close enough to the log of the alphabet size .",
    "we now briefly summarize the layout of the rest of the paper . in section  [ defns ] ,",
    "we give definitions and basic preliminary results required for our arguments . in section  [ props ] , we state and prove our main result . in section  [ unrelated ] , we show that that @xmath24-fullness is unrelated to any existing topological mixing conditions in the literature , i.e. it does not imply and is not implied by any of these conditions .",
    "section  [ comparison ] compares our condition with some other sufficient conditions for uniqueness of measure of maximal entropy from the literature , and in section  [ critical ] , we discuss the maximal values of @xmath4 which still guarantee uniqueness of measure of maximal entropy for all nearest neighbor @xmath3-dimensional sfts with entropy at least @xmath28 , in particular proving polynomially decaying upper and lower bounds on these values .",
