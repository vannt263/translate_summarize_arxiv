    "dark matter haloes of a galaxy and a cluster of galaxies form though the hierarchical bottom - up assembly of smaller structures .",
    "the averaged density profile of the dark matter haloes found in @xmath8-body simulations has a universal broken power - law form @xcite .",
    "the universal profile is characterized by a single parameter ( called the concentration parameter ) describing the ratio of the scale radius ( where the power - law slope is approximately @xmath9 ) to the virial radius which defines a halo s mass .",
    "the concentration parameter is known to be related to the halo mass , a correlation which most likely arises from the mass assembly history of haloes @xcite .",
    "since the mass assembly history depends on the cosmological model , the mass  concentration relation does as well @xcite .",
    "therefore placing constraints on both the cosmological model and the mass  concentration relation simultaneously allows us to test the @xmath5cdm structure formation scenario .",
    "clusters of galaxies serve as one of the most important tests of the cosmic structure formation model . due to their high virial temperatures ,",
    "the dissipative cooling of baryons is less effective , and thus the density profile of clusters may be well approximated by the dark matter distribution , allowing us to test the mass  concentration relation ( see for a recent review * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "also , cluster number counts have placed useful constraint on the cosmological parameters @xcite .",
    "it is argued in recent studies that number counts of clusters of galaxies identified in weak lensing mass maps ( which we call weak lensing cluster counts ) can be a powerful probe of both the cosmological model and the mass  concentration relation @xcite .",
    "this can be simply understood as follows : first , the number density of massive clusters of galaxies , which appear as high peaks on the weak lensing mass maps , depends of the cosmological model @xcite .",
    "second , peak heights depend on the density profile of clusters and thus on the mass  concentration relation @xcite .    both observational techniques and theoretical models of weak lensing cluster counts",
    "have been greatly developed in the last decade .",
    "on the observational side , systematic weak lensing cluster searches have become practicable .",
    "@xcite presented the first large sample of weak lensing peaks ( which are plausible candidates of clusters / groups of galaxies ) in @xmath10 degree@xmath0 subaru weak lensing survey data , with 100 peaks with signal - to - noise ratio exceeding @xmath11 .",
    "@xcite reported 301 weak lensing high peaks ( @xmath12 ) located from 64 degree@xmath0 of cfhtls - wide data , among those peaks , they confirmed 85 groups / clusters . on the theoretical side , models of the weak lensing cluster counts have been developed : based on the pioneering work by , some improvements have been made , including the effect of the galaxy intrinsic ellipticities @xcite , the effect of the large - scale structures , the effect of the diversity of the dark matter distribution within clusters @xcite , and an optimal choice of the filter function .",
    "now , the theoretical models were tested ( or calibrated ) against @xmath8-body simulations and good agreements were found ( see the above references ) .",

    "in contrast to previous work @xcite , we deal only with high peaks , with @xmath2 .",
    "such high peaks mostly associate with a real massive cluster of galaxies , and thus we shall use the term `` weak lensing cluster counts '' instead of `` weak lensing peak counts '' .",

    "thus we use the @xmath42 value only for placing a confidence region on parameter spaces , adopting confidence levels assuming a normal distribution .",
    "we treat @xmath41 , @xmath40 and @xmath7 as free parameters .",
    "constraints obtained from the weak lensing cluster counts have degeneracy between those parameters @xcite .",
    "however , since we have only one observed value with poor statistics , we do not explore the three - parameter space , but we examine two - parameter space , fixing one remaining parameter .",
    "figure [ fig : fig9.eps ] shows the derived constraint on @xmath4 plane .",
    "here we did not treat @xmath7 as a fitting parameter but adopted the value ( @xmath49 ) found from dark matter @xmath8-body simulations by @xcite in which the @xmath5cdm model with @xmath50 and @xmath51 was employed .",
    "therefore the constraint mainly comes from the cosmology dependence of the dark matter halo mass function with a minor contribution from the cosmology dependent lensing efficiency .",
    "accordingly , the constraint exhibits the @xmath4 degeneracy in a similar fashion to x - ray cluster counts .    figure [ fig : fig10.eps ] shows the derived constraint on the @xmath6 plane , where the density parameter was fixed with @xmath83 .",
    "the degeneracy in the @xmath6 space results from two relationships : one is increasing dark matter halo number density for larger @xmath40 , and the other is higher @xmath1-peak for larger @xmath7",
    ". both of them result in larger weak lensing cluster counts .",
    "the upper limit on @xmath7 is hardly placed , because of the degeneracy in @xmath6 and , for a given smoothing kernel , an excessively concentrated halo compared with the smoothing scale causes little variation in the peak height @xcite .",
    "although the current constraint does not even place a useful upper / lower limit on those parameters due to the poor statistics , this demonstrates that weak lensing cluster counts can be a useful probe of the cosmic structure formation scenario . the same argument , but based on a slightly different methodology , was already made by @xcite .",
    "finally , for a demonstrative purpose , we present in figure [ fig : fig11.eps ] , the constraint on a single parameter @xmath7 for two representative cosmological models : the planck ( @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) and wmap 9-year ( @xmath83 , @xmath51 ) @xcite .",
    "it is obvious that the measured weak lensing cluster counts are consistent with the currently popular @xmath5cdm model .",
    "specifically , the result from @xmath8-body simulations by @xcite ( @xmath49 ) is well within the 68.3% confidence region of both the planck and wmap9 cosmologies .",
    "we presented the results of weak lensing cluster counts obtained from 11 degree@xmath0 subaru / suprimecam data .",
    "for the first time , we used the weak lensing cluster counts to place cosmological parameters and the mass  concentration relationship . in doing this , we explored , in an experimental manner , the capability and current issues of weak lensing cluster counts for cosmological studies .",
    "the data were selected under the conditions that the exposure time longer than 1,800  sec along with the seeing condition of @xmath86  arcsec .",
    "these selection criteria result in the effective number density of galaxies usable for weak lensing shape measurement of @xmath87 arcmin@xmath88 , which is about twice as large as those of previous works dealing with weak lensing peak statistics , namely , the cfhtlens by @xcite and cfht stripe-82 survey by @xcite .",
    "since the shape noise in the @xmath18 map scales as @xmath89 , higher galaxy density lifts up the peak height of a lensing signal of massive clusters .",
    "this allows us to adopt a high threshold @xmath1 , in our case @xmath2 . with high @xmath1 ,",
    "the contamination rate due to false signals is small , which enables us to construct a weak lensing - selected cluster sample .    we used _",
    "lensfit _ for weak lensing shear measurement .",
    "we examined the additive bias in the measured galaxy ellipticities by evaluating weighted mean ellipticities as a function of galaxy size and magnitude .",
    "we found non - zero additive bias for both @xmath90 and @xmath91 , which were found to be mainly caused by faint and small galaxies , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the result of cfhtlens in which small and bright galaxies were found to be a cause of additive bias in @xmath91 @xcite .",
    "the cause of these non - zero biases is unclear , but those different trends for different data sets may suggest that it may be caused by some instrumental or data - dependent effect .",
    "we evaluated the amplitude of the multiplicative bias , adopting the empirical fitting function derived from cfhtlens image simulations @xcite , and found the weighted average value of @xmath92 .",
    "this does not have influence on the measured peak-@xmath1 , as both the signal and noise rms are affected in the same way , and thus those are canceled out . however , this must be properly taken into account in making the theoretical prediction .",
    "since in the current study we considered the statistical quantity ( peak counts ) , we adopted a statistical correction scheme that calibrating the shape noise rms with the average bias factor @xmath93 .",
    "we found 6 peaks with @xmath2 .",
    "for all the peaks , previously identified clusters of galaxies are matched within a separation of @xmath94 arcmin .",
    "most of the matched clusters were identified as a galaxy concentration in the sky and in multi - band color space of optical / infrared data .",
    "this provides us with a firm inspection of the purity of the weak lensing cluster sample .",
    "in fact , optical multi - band images are well suited to cross - identification , as the sensitivity of weak lensing mass map to cluster finding is most effective for clusters within the redshift range @xmath95 , where the red - sequence of cluster galaxies is located in optical color space .",
    "thus , ongoing optical multi - band galaxy surveys with a single band observation being optimized for weak lensing shape measurement , namely the kilo - degree survey ( kids ) , dark energy survey ( des ) , and hyper - suprimecam ( hsc ) survey @xcite , may provide self - contained datasets for weak lensing cluster finding . also , photometric redshifts will be estimated from multi - band data for each galaxy , which enable the source galaxy redshift distributions to be accurately determined .",
    "we evaluated the statistical error in the weak lensing cluster counts using mock weak lensing data generated from full - sky ray - tracing simulations , and found @xmath96 .",
    "this error consists of the poisson noise and the cosmic variance , with a larger contribution from the former .",
    "we compared the measured weak lensing cluster counts with the theoretical model developed by @xcite , in which the effects of intrinsic galaxy shape , the diversity of dark matter distributions within haloes , and large - scale structures are included . utilizing the standard @xmath42 method , we placed constraints on the @xmath4 plane , which was found to be consistent with currently standard @xmath5cdm models such as planck model and wmap 9-year model @xcite , though the constraints are much broader than those cmb experiments due to the poor statistics ( @xmath97 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated that the weak lensing cluster counts may place a unique constraint on @xmath6 plane .",
    "finally we discuss prospects for ongoing / future surveys , taking the des and hsc surveys as examples . even taking into account a lower usable galaxy number density for those surveys , due to the shallower survey depth than this study",
    ", it may be feasible to obtain @xmath98 clusters with @xmath99 ( which can be achieved with @xmath100 peak / degree@xmath0 for hsc survey of 1,400 degree@xmath0 , and @xmath101 peak / degree@xmath0 for des of 5,000 degree@xmath0 ) . in that case",
    ", the error is dominated by the poisson error and the expected fractional error will be @xmath102 .",
    "this is 10 times better than the current study , @xmath103 .",
    "therefore confidence regions become smaller and thus tighter constraints will be obtained ; taking figure [ fig : fig11.eps ] as an illustrative example , the corresponding 68.3% confidence level becomes @xmath104 .",
    "this demonstrates that this methodology will be a useful probe of the cosmology and @xmath39 relation , though , in reality , marginalization over other parameters and degeneracy among parameters weaken constraints .",
    "more quantitative investigations of the capability of this method based on a fisher analysis were made by @xcite .",
    "having found that tight cosmological constraints can be achieved using the significantly improved statistics expected for ongoing / future surveys , it is necessary to check whether the theoretical model is correspondingly accurate , which is beyond the scope of this paper and is left for a future work .",

    "as described in  [ sec : dataanalysis ] , the instrumental distortion of images was corrected in the process of mosaic stacking along with astrometric calibration of ccd data using _ hscpipe _ in which the relationship between pixel coordinates and world coordinates systems ( wcss ) is represented by sip convention @xcite . in _ lensfit _",
    ", on the other hand , tpv convention is implemented . here",
    "we describe the method for conversion of wcss from sip to tpv .",
    "first , we summarize the sip convention following @xcite .",
    "let @xmath105 be relative pixel coordinates on a detector device with origin at crpix1 , crpix2 , and @xmath106 be distortion corrected `` intermediate world coordinates '' in degree with origin at crval1 , crval2 .",
    "then @xmath107 where @xmath108 matrix encodes scaling , rotation and skew , and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are polynomial functions that represent distortion , given by @xmath111 in the standard sip convention , a_order and b_order are allowed to range from 2 to 9 .",
    "next , we summarize the tpv convention , in which relative pixel coordinates ( @xmath105 ) are first converted to `` distorted world coordinates '' @xmath112 by @xmath113 then `` intermediate world coordinates '' @xmath114 can be given by polynomial functions of @xmath115 and @xmath116 as , @xmath117 where @xmath118 , and the tpv polynomial functions have odd - power terms of @xmath119 .",
    "the polynomial order of tpv is defined up to 7th , thus there are @xmath120 pv@xmath121_@xmath122 coefficients including @xmath123 odd @xmath124-terms .",
    "we derive conversion equations from sip coefficients to tpv coefficients .",
    "to do so , we limit the polynomial order of sip ( a_order and b_order ) being equal to or less than 7th , because that of tpv is defined up to 7th .    we can set pv@xmath121_@xmath122 coefficients for @xmath124-terms , @xmath125 , @xmath126 , @xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129 , @xmath130 and @xmath131 .",
    "] zero , because there are no corresponding terms in sip polynomials .",
    "also , we can safely use the same origins of @xmath132 and @xmath114 coordinates for tpv as those for sip , because we derive the same distortion polynomial models as those of sip but in the different ( tpv ) convention ( thus the same crpix1 , crpix2 , crval1 and crval2 can be used ) .",
    "then , we can set @xmath133 as there are no corresponding terms in sip .",
    "in addition , utilizing redundant degree of freedom in tpv convention , we can safely take the same @xmath108 matrix as one of sip .    equating the sip and tpv coefficients of each @xmath134 terms by order - by - order , we have the following simultaneous equations : for the 1st order , @xmath135 which can be inverted and can be solved as , @xmath136 these are a natural consequence of distortion polynomial functions of sip convention being defined only for 2nd and higher order terms ( see eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sip1 ] ) and ( [ eq : fg - ab ] ) ) . for the 2nd order",
    ", we have @xmath137 and @xmath138 in the same manner , one can derive simultaneous equations in matrix form for higher order terms . therefore , tpv coefficients , @xmath139 , can be obtained by solving those simultaneous equations using the standard matrix inversion method . in an actual computation , we performed matrix inversion and multiplication numerically ."

    "<S> we present results of weak lensing cluster counts obtained from 11 degree@xmath0 subaru / suprimecam data . </S>",
    "<S> although the area is much smaller than previous work dealing with weak lensing peak statistics , the number density of galaxies usable for weak lensing analysis is about twice as large as those . </S>",
    "<S> the higher galaxy number density reduces the noise in the weak lensing mass maps , and thus increases the signal - to - noise ratio ( @xmath1 ) of peaks of the lensing signal due to massive clusters . </S>",
    "<S> this enables us to construct a weak lensing selected cluster sample by adopting a high threshold @xmath1 , such that the contamination rate due to false signals is small . </S>",
    "<S> we find 6 peaks with @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> for all the peaks , previously identified clusters of galaxies are matched within a separation of 1 arcmin , demonstrating good correspondence between the peaks and clusters of galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> we evaluate the statistical error in the weak lensing cluster counts using mock weak lensing data generated from full - sky ray - tracing simulations , and find @xmath3 in an effective area of 9.0 degree@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the measured weak lensing cluster counts with the theoretical model prediction based on halo models and place the constraint on @xmath4 plane which is found to be consistent with currently standard @xmath5cdm models . </S>",
    "<S> it is demonstrated that the weak lensing cluster counts can place a unique constraint on @xmath6 plane , where @xmath7 is the normalization of the dark matter halo mass  concentration relationship . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss prospects for ongoing / future wide field optical galaxy surveys . </S>"
