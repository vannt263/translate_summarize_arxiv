    "one of the simplest molecular models that one can conceive of for flexible chains is that formed by tangent lennard - jones monomers . the pair potential between two monomers ( either belonging to the same molecule or belonging to different molecules ) is given by the lennard - jones potential with potential parameters @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the reduced bond length @xmath4 between bonded monomers is fixed to the value @xmath5 so that , in some respects , one may say that the chain is formed by `` tangent '' monomers .",
    "there is neither a bending potential constraining the angle between three contiguous monomers of the chain , nor a torsional potential between four contiguous monomers .",
    "we shall take the liberty of denoting this model as the fully flexible tangent lj chain model , or , more succinctly , as the lj chain model .",
    "the lj chain model provides an ideal starting point for the computational and theoretical study of simple polymer chains .",
    "one of the attractive features of the lj chain model in such a study is the large and ever growing body of theoretical and simulation work published over the last decade or so .",
    "a great in - road to the theoretical treatment of molecular fluids was provided by wertheim . in the nineteen eighties wertheim",
    "developed a theory for associating fluids @xcite .",
    "when the association strength becomes infinitely strong then chains are formed from a fluid of associating monomers @xcite . in this way it was possible to derive an equation of state for a chain of freely jointed tangent monomers by using thermodynamic information of the monomer reference fluid only . in the simplest implementation of the theory ( tpt1 )",
    "the only information required to build an approximate equation of state for the chain fluid is the equation of state and the pair correlation function at contact of the monomer fluid .",
    "although wertheim s formalism was originally conceived for hard chains it soon realized that it could also be applied to lj chains @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that wertheim s tpt1 provides a good description of the thermodynamic properties of the lj chains in the fluid phase ( including the description of the vapor - liquid equilibria ) .",
    "although a lot of work has been devoted to the study of lj chains in the fluid phase@xcite , studies of lj chains in the solid phase are rather scarce .",
    "the solid phase of diatomic lj models has been considered@xcite by lisal et al .",
    "( for @xmath6 ) and by vega , blas , galindo @xcite ( for @xmath7 ) . semi - flexible lj chains ( with @xmath8 and a bending potential favoring the linear configuration ) have been considered by polson and frenkel@xcite . a natural question that arises",
    "is the possibility of extending wertheim s tpt1 to the solid phase .",
    "recently we have shown that such an extension is indeed possible .",
    "vega and macdowell @xcite have shown that wertheim s tpt1 can be extended to the solid phase of freely jointed hard spheres obtaining excellent agreement with the simulation results of malanoski and monson@xcite .",
    "similar results were obtained in two dimensions @xcite .",
    "encouraged by these results vega , blas and galindo extended wertheim s tpt1 to lj chains in the solid phase@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that wertheim s tpt1 provides a good description of the equation of state and internal energy of the lj dimer in the solid phase .",
    "theoretical predictions for longer lj chains in the solid phase ( formed by m=3,4,5,6 monomers ) have been published @xcite but , due to the lack of simulation results for lj chains in the solid phase , a direct comparison with the numerical results was not possible .",
    "the goal of this paper is to perform computer simulations of lj chains in the solid phase and to compare the theoretical predictions of wertheim s tpt1 to the numerical results .",
    "let us briefly discuss the solid structure of lj chains .",
    "lennard - jones monomers freeze @xcite into a close packed structure ( face centered cubic , fcc ) . in principle",
    "one may suspect that the solid structure of lj chains should be related to the close packed structure of the lj monomer .",
    "one possibility for the solid structure of lj chains is to form layers of molecules with the chains adopting a linear configuration , with all the molecules within the same layer pointing in the same direction .",
    "examples of such of structures were presented in earlier work for hard diatomic fluids ( hard dumbbells ) by vega et al .",
    "@xcite and for lj chains ( with bending potential favoring linear configurations ) by polson and frenkel@xcite . in the particular case of the so called cp1 structure ( see ref.@xcite for details ) the molecular axis of all the molecules of the solid point in the same direction .",
    "there is no doubt that this should indeed be the stable solid structure when a `` bending '' potential between contiguous monomers of the chain exists , as is the case in the study by polson and frenkel , or for a linear rigid chain .",
    "however , it is likely that ordered structures ( those formed by layers of oriented molecules ) are not the stable solid phase for fully flexible lj chains ( i.e. chains with no bending potential ) .",
    "it is possible to build a solid structure where the atoms follow an face centered cubic ( fcc ) close packing but where the bonds of the dimers are located randomly within the solid , with no long range orientational order between the bond vectors of the chains .",
    "wojciechowski et al.@xcite were the first to realize this important feature .",
    "we shall denote this structure as the disordered solid .",
    "in fact wojciechowski , branka and frenkel @xcite showed that the stable solid structure of tangent hard discs dimers in two dimensions is formed by a close packed arrangement of atoms with a disordered arrangement of bonds .",
    "the same idea holds for hard chains in three dimensions @xcite and one may expect that the same would occur for a three dimensional lj fully flexible chain .    in a sense",
    "this is one of natures clever solutions .",
    "the molecules may achieve the close packing structure of the monomers , leading to an optimally high density .",
    "at the same time the bond structure of the system is disordered .",
    "the great beauty of such a system is the stabilizing effect of an additional contribution to the entropy of the system arising from the degeneracy of the solid structure ( i.e. there are a number of ways of forming the disordered solid whereas there is only one way of forming the ordered solid ) . for m=2",
    "this degeneracy has been estimated by nagle@xcite , and for longer chains malanoski and monson have shown that can be estimated quite accurately from the flory - huggins lattice theory of chains@xcite .",
    "the scheme of the paper is as follows . in section ii the extension of wertheim",
    "s theory to the solid phase of lj chains shall be be described . in section iii",
    "we shall provide details of the simulations performed in this work . in section iv the results of this work will be presented , and in section v the conclusions shall be presented .",
    "since details of the extension of wertheim s tpt1 to the solid phase for lj chains has been published previously @xcite the following forms only an outline description of the technique .",
    "let one assume that there are a certain number , @xmath9 , of spherical monomer particles within a certain volume @xmath10 at temperature @xmath11 .",
    "these spherical particles interact with each other via a spherical pair potential @xmath12 . in this work",
    "the pair potential @xmath12 will be the lennard - jones potential with parameters @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we shall denote this fluid as the reference fluid and the properties of this reference fluid will be labeled by the superscript @xmath13 .",
    "let us also assume that in another container of volume @xmath10 and temperature @xmath11 , we have @xmath14 fully flexible chains of @xmath15 monomers each . by fully flexible chains we mean chains of @xmath15 monomers , with a fixed bond length of @xmath0 , and no other constraints ( i.e there is no restriction in either bonding angles or in the torsional angles ) .",
    "each monomer of a certain chain interacts with all the other monomers in the system ( i.e in the same molecule or in other molecules with the only exception being the monomer / s to which it is bonded ) with the pair potential @xmath12 .",
    "the chain system described so far will be denoted as the chain fluid .",
    "it follows from wertheim s tpt1 that the free energy of the chain model is given by :    @xmath16    the above equation shows that the free energy of the chain may be obtained from a knowledge of the residual free energy of the reference fluid and the pair background correlation function @xmath17 of the reference fluid at the bonding distance of the chain@xcite .",
    "it is worth recalling that wertheim s tpt1 is normally used to to describe chains formed by `` tangent '' spheres ( i.e those with reduced bond length between monomers @xmath7 ) .",
    "since for the lj potential model the pair potential is zero for @xmath18 it turns out that for this particular choice of bond length , @xmath17 is equal to @xmath19 , so that one is able to replace @xmath17 by @xmath19 in eq.[achain ]",
    ".    the equation of state which follows from eq.[achain ] is given by :    @xmath20    where we have defined @xmath21 as @xmath22 .",
    "the residual part of the internal energy u is given by :    @xmath23    we shall denote eq.[achain ] , eq.[zchain ] and eq.[uchain ] as wertheim s tpt1 theory .",
    "we note that the arguments used to arrive at eq.[achain ] and eq.[zchain ] make no special mention whatsoever to the actual nature of the phase considered @xcite .",
    "therefore the equations can be applied to both the fluid and the solid phases .",
    "the possibility of extending wertheim s tpt1 to the solid phase has been explored only in the last three years @xcite .",
    "all that is required in order to obtain a fully unified theory for the phase equilibria of chain molecules is the residual free energy , compressibility factor and pair correlation function of the monomer fluid both for the fluid and solid phases . for the fluid phase johnson et al.@xcite have provided values of the free energy and structural properties ( i.e @xmath24 ) of the monomer lj fluid .",
    "therefore , for the fluid phase we shall use the implementation of tpt1 provided by johnson et al .",
    "for the solid phase van der hoef @xcite has recently proposed an analytical expression for the free energy of the lj monomer solid .",
    "this analytical expression is essentially a fit to the most recent simulation results for the solid phase of this model .",
    "therefore we shall simply adopt the expression provided by van der hoef for the free energy of the lj monomer solid .",
    "the other piece of information required by the theory is the value of @xmath24 for the lj monomer solid . in ref.@xcite",
    "we have performed computer simulations of the lj monomer in the solid phase to obtain @xmath24 for a number of temperatures and densities .",
    "the simulations results for @xmath24 were fitted to an empirical expression similar to that proposed by johnson et al . for the fluid phase @xcite . in this work",
    "we shall use the expression given by us in ref.@xcite for @xmath24 of the solid phase , which is essentially a fit to the structural results from simulations of the lj monomer solid .",
    "the model considered in this work consists of a chain formed by @xmath15 identical lj sites .",
    "the bond distance between contiguous monomer units is given by @xmath0 .",
    "the pair interaction between a pair of molecules is given by :    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the distance between site @xmath27 of molecule 1 and site @xmath28 of molecule 2 .",
    "we also used the lj potential to describe the interaction between monomers of the same chain separated by at least two molecular bonds ( i.e. a lj potential was not included between contiguous bonded monomers of the same chain ) .    in order to describe a disordered structure",
    ", we generated a close packed arrangement ( fcc ) of atoms with the molecular bonds randomly distributed .",
    "a trial and error algorithm was used to generate the initial disordered structures .",
    "the algorithm starts at one corner of a face centered cubic lattice with sufficient number of lattice points to contain an integer number of molecules .",
    "bonds are made to unoccupied randomly chosen adjacent lattice points until a molecule is placed .",
    "the algorithm then looks for the next vacant space in order to place the first atom of the second molecule .",
    "once placed , bonds are once again made by randomly selecting one of the unoccupied adjacent lattice points . if none of the adjacent lattice points are unoccupied then the algorithm restarts from the beginning .",
    "this algorithm only works well for short chains with a modest number of lattice points .",
    "once a randomly ordered configuration has been generated then the structure can be copied , rotated and translated . in this work",
    "the initial structures were as follows : for @xmath29 , 64 molecules were randomly packed , for @xmath30 , 27 molecules were packed randomly , and for @xmath31 18 molecules were randomly placed .",
    "these initial structures were then duplicated twelve times for @xmath29 thus resulting in a system with @xmath32 , eight times for @xmath30 thus resulting in a system with @xmath33 , and eight times for @xmath34 thus resulting in a system with @xmath35 .    for a number of representative systems a second disordered configuration",
    "was generated in order to check for differences in the thermodynamic properties . upon analysis such differences were found to be minimal .",
    "simulations were initiated at very high pressures where the density is close to the close packing limit ( note that there is no true close packing density for a soft potential such as the lj case , however , the reduced monomer number density of hard spheres at close packing @xmath36 proved to be a good starting point ) . after generating the initial structure at the close packing density ( i.e. the reduced number density of lj monomers was @xmath36 ) this structure was expanded to lower densities by performing npt monte carlo simulations @xcite at successively lower pressures . since the distribution of bonds in the solid phase was isotropic , changes in the volume of the simulation box",
    "were made isotropically .",
    "for all of the simulations performed in this work the site - site lj pair potential was truncated at @xmath37 and long range interactions were added to all the computed thermodynamic properties ( internal energy , pressure ) by assuming that the site - site pair correlation function is unity beyond the cutoff@xcite",
    ". a cycle will be defined as a trial move per particle , plus a trial volume change .",
    "three different kind of trial moves were used : translation of the whole molecule , rotation of the whole molecule and configurational bias move .",
    "the aforementioned trial moves were performed with the following probabilities ; @xmath38,@xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively . in the configurational",
    "bias move a segment of the chain was chosen randomly and the chains were re - grown in a random direction .",
    "typically @xmath40 trial orientations were used for re - growing each segment of the chain . since",
    "configurational bias is now a standard technique we refer the reader to @xcite for further details . throughout this work",
    "reduced units shall be used , so that @xmath41 , @xmath42 , and @xmath43 . a typical run of the solid phase involved 70000 cycles of equilibration followed by 70000 cycles for obtaining equilibrium properties .    in summary ,",
    "isotropic npt ensemble was applied to an fcc arrangement of atoms with randomly assigned bonds vectors , using translation rotation and configurational bias moves .",
    "as an initial check of the simulation code and the structure generation algorithm a system of fully flexible hard sphere chains with @xmath30 monomers was simulated .",
    "the results of this simulation were compared to the work of malanoski and monson@xcite .",
    "the results of this benchmark are presented in fig.1 . as can be seen",
    "the simulation results of this work agree rather nicely with those of malanoski and monson . along with",
    "the simulation results the predictions from wertheim s tpt1 for hard sphere chains @xcite in the solid phase are also presented . as it can be seen",
    "the agreement is again quite good .",
    "we shall not comment further on this point since extensive comparison between simulation and theory for hard sphere chains exists in published literature @xcite .    in tables",
    "i , ii and iii simulation results for lj chains with m=3,4,5 monomer units are presented .",
    "results correspond to two isotherms , namely @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    in fig.2",
    "a comparison is made between simulation and theoretical results for lj chains with @xmath29 . in fig.2a results",
    "are presented for the equation of state ( eos ) and in fig.2b for the internal energy .",
    "as can be seen the theory describes quite accurately the simulation results both for the eos and for the internal energies . when expanding the solid it was found that the solid melts at a certain pressure .",
    "we observed this espontaneous melting for the two considered temperatures ( @xmath44 and @xmath45 ) .",
    "the lines of fig.2 correspond to wertheim s tpt1 theory .",
    "fig.2 illustrates that wertheim s tpt1 works quite well not only for the fluid phase , but also for the solid phase .",
    "it is well known that wertheim s tpt1 describes quite well the fluid phase .",
    "fig.2 show clear evidence that wertheim s tpt1 describes quite well also the solid phase . in fig.3",
    "a comparison is made between simulation and theoretical results for lj chains with @xmath30 . in fig.3a results",
    "are presented for the equation of state ( eos ) and in fig.3b for the internal energy .",
    "again the theory performs very well for both properties . for",
    "the two considered temperatures the solid phase melted into an isotropic fluid when decreasing the pressure .",
    "finally in fig.4 a comparison is made between simulation and theoretical results for lj chains in the solid phase with @xmath34 . in fig.5a results",
    "are presented for the equation of state ( eos ) and in fig.5b for the internal energy",
    ". the theory one again is successful in describing the simulation results .",
    "for the two considered temperatures the solid phase melted into an isotropic fluid when decreasing the pressure .    for each of the chains considered in this work the agreement between theory and simulation for @xmath44 is as good as that for @xmath45 thus indicating that the theory does not deteriorate with respect to variations in the temperature ( at least for the range of temperatures considered here ) .",
    "good agreement between theory and simulation has previously been seen for the lj dimer ( m=2 ) in the solid phase@xcite",
    ". however , it is certainly gratifying to observe that the theory continues to perform well with increasing chain length .",
    "the message of figures 2 - 4 is that wertheim s tpt1 theory can be used with confidence to predict the thermodynamic properties , both for the eos and internal energies of lj chains in the solid phase .",
    "it would be interesting to see if wertheim s theory is able also able to accurately predict the free energies of lj chains in the solid phase .",
    "the determination of free energies of solid from computer simulation requires special techniques ( einstein crystal calculations@xcite ) . at this point",
    "it is possible to mention that for @xmath46 the comparison between free energies of the solid phase as obtained from wertheim s tpt1 and from einstein crystal calculations is quite good @xcite .",
    "free energy calculations of lj chains would certainly present an interesting problem for future work .",
    "one of the consequences of wertheim theory is the existence of asymptotic limits@xcite of the thermodynamic properties when plotted as a function of the number of monomer units per unit of volume ( instead of plotting them as a function of the number of molecules per unit of volume ) .",
    "let let us define the monomer number density @xmath47 as @xmath48 . in wertheim",
    "s formalism , the compressibility factor @xmath49 and residual internal energy @xmath50 can be written as @xcite    @xmath51    where @xmath52 stands for any of the thermodynamic properties ( z or @xmath50 ) .",
    "for sufficiently large values of @xmath15 , eq.[linear ] can be written as :    @xmath53    and @xmath54 @xmath55    according to eq.([linearp ] ) for very long chains ( @xmath15 sufficiently large ) , the reduced pressure is a function of the reduced temperature and of the reduced monomer number density only . in view of this a plot of @xmath56 versus @xmath47 for a certain temperature should yield a universal curve ( regardless of the length of the chain @xmath15 ) . also according to eq.([linearu ] ) for very long chains ( @xmath15 sufficiently large ) , the residual internal energy per monomer unit depends only on the temperature and on the reduced monomer density .",
    "therefore a plot of @xmath57 versus @xmath47 for a certain temperature should also yield a universal curve .",
    "obviously the chains considered in this work are rather short ( @xmath58 ) and do not constitute large values of @xmath15 .",
    "however it is worth checking whether this prediction of wertheim s tpt1 holds for the simulation results of this work . in fig.5a",
    "the reduced pressure is plotted as a function of the reduced monomer number density . in fig.5b",
    "the residual internal energy is plotted as a function of the reduced monomer number density .",
    "it can be seen that although the results depend on the length of the chain the presence of an asymptotic limit is clearly visible .",
    "the results of fig.5 support the prediction of tpt1 on the existence of an asymptotic limit and illustrate that even a chain of m=5 monomer units is not too far from such a limit .",
    "this work has been devoted to fully flexible linear lj chains and all the results presented so far correspond to that model .",
    "we shall now present an different model that shall be denoted as the `` linear rigid '' chain . in the linear rigid chain",
    "the bond length , bond angles and internal degrees of freedom are fixed .",
    "this linear rigid lj chain is formed by @xmath15 lj monomer units with bond length @xmath0 in a linear rigid configuration .",
    "notice that the hamiltonian of a system of fully flexible lj chains and that of the linear rigid lj chain are different .",
    "in fact in the first model there are intra - molecular interactions ( between non bonded monomer units ) whereas these intra - molecular interactions are missing in the `` linear rigid chain '' ( or one can say more generally that the intra - molecular energy is simply a constant ) . also in the first model the molecule can adopt any bond angle or torsional state reflecting the fact the molecule is indeed flexible whereas these degrees of freedom are frozen in the `` linear rigid chain '' .",
    "tpt1 theory does not distinguish between fully flexible and `` linear rigid '' chains and therefore it predicts the same eos for for a fully flexible chain and for a fully rigid chain .",
    "this surprising results holds very well in the fluid phase , both for hard sphere chains@xcite and for lj chains .",
    "in fact in the fluid phase fully flexible and fully rigid chains present a quite similar ( although not identical ) eos .",
    "is this also true in the solid phase ?",
    "it has been shown recently @xcite that the similarity between fully flexible and fully rigid linear chains does not hold in the solid phase .",
    "in fact in the case of hard sphere chains the eos of fully flexible chains differs considerably with that of `` linear rigid '' chains .",
    "given that wertheim s tpt1 describes very well the eos of fully flexible hard sphere chains in the solid phase and fails completely in describing the eos of `` linear rigid '' chains in the solid phase , one may inquire as to the situation for lj chains in the solid phase . to illustrate whether flexible and rigid lj chains present the same or different eos in the solid phase we have performed npt simulation for linear rigid lj chains .",
    "details are similar to those previously presented for flexible chains .",
    "two difference are encountered .",
    "firstly the initial configuration of the solid is not a random configuration but an ordered one .",
    "the ordered structure used is the one denoted as cp1 in ref.@xcite .",
    "this cp1 structure is similar to that proposed by polson and frenkel for lj semi - flexible chains .",
    "the second difference is that we used anisotropic npt scaling in the way described in ref.@xcite this is important since our simulation box ( and the symmetry of the unit cell ) is no longer cubic .    in table",
    "iv simulations results for `` linear rigid '' lj chains with @xmath29 are presented . in fig.6a",
    "the eos for @xmath29 as obtained from wertheim s tpt1 , and from the monte carlo results of this work for fully flexible and linear rigid chains are presented .",
    "the conclusion is clear .",
    "although at very high densities flexible and linear rigid chains present a quite similar equation of state , differences are clearly visible at smaller densities within the solid phase .",
    "the linear rigid chain tends to hava a higher density for a certain pressure .",
    "a second significant difference was that for the linear rigid chaini model the solid phase was mechanically stable up to zero pressure .",
    "that provides some evidence that the triple point temperature of linear rigid chains may appears at higher temperatures than this of flexible chains .",
    "free energy calculations will be necessary to check this point . in fig.6b",
    "the internal energy for @xmath29 is presented for both flexible and linear rigid chains . again",
    "differences between flexible and linear rigid chains are clearly visible . for a certain density",
    "the internal energy of the linear rigid chain is lower than this of the flexible chain . to analyze in more detail",
    "if differences between flexible and linear rigid chains increases with the length of the chain , we have performed simulations also for linear rigid chains with @xmath34 .",
    "results are presented in table v. in fig.7 a comparison is made between flexible and linear rigid chains with @xmath34 . in fig.7a for the eos and in fig.7b for the internal energy .",
    "differences between flexible and linear rigid chains are quite evident .",
    "differences are larger than for the model with @xmath29 indicating that the differences between flexible and linear rigid chain in the solid phase , increases with the length of the chain . only at very high densities ( when approaching the `` close packing '' ) differences are found to be small .",
    "in summary we have found that for lj chains in the solid phase , fully flexible and fully rigid molecules present markedly different equations of state . this has already been observed for hard sphere chains , and the work here serves as a further illustration that the same occurs again for lj chains .",
    "tpt1 describes very well the eos of fully flexible chains but fails to describe the behavior of of linear rigid lj chains .",
    "one may conclude that the similarity between fully flexible and `` linear rigid '' chains is broken in the solid phase .",
    "notice that the `` close packed '' density in the solid phase is the same for fully flexible and for linear rigid chains , so that a different packing density is not the reason for the differences found in fig.6 and in fig.7 .",
    "let us just finish by analizing an interesting issue .",
    "although it is clear that for flexible chains the equilibrium solid structure is a disordered solid , and for linear rigid chains the equilibrium solid structure is an ordered one , one may ask how would be the properties of a flexible chain if arranged in an ordered solid .",
    "malanoski and monson @xcite considered this aspect for flexible hard chains .",
    "malanoski and monson showed that the stable solid phase for hard flexible chains is a disordered solid @xcite .",
    "they also analized the behaviour of a flexible hard chain in an ordered solid .",
    "they found that for hard flexible chains at a certain density , the ordered solid gave a higher pressure than the disordered one . to analyze if this result holds also for lj chains we decided to perform npt simulations ( with anisotropic scaling ) of flexible lj in an ordered cp1 solid structure .",
    "results for this flexible lj chain in an ordered solid structure are presented in table vi . in fig.7",
    "the results of these simulations are also presented ( they are labeled as flexible chain ordered solid ) . as it can be seen in fig.7a for a certain density the pressure of the flexible chain in the ordered",
    "solid is slightly higher than this of the flexible chain in the disordered solid .",
    "differences are not too large but clearly visible .",
    "our results agree with those of malanoski and monson in the sense that they yield higher pressures for the ordered solid with respect to the disordered solid .",
    "a simple sumary of fig.7a would be to say that flexible and linear rigid chains present a quite different eos in the solid phase and that differences between different solid structures of the flexible chains ( disordered or ordered ) are much smaller ) at least for the case considered here ( @xmath34 ) . in fig.7b results",
    "are presented for the internal energy .",
    "it is seen that for the flexible chain , the ordered solid present a lower internal energy than this of the disordered solid .",
    "the reader should not take that as an evidence of the greater stability of the ordered solid with respect to the disordered solid for flexible chains .",
    "notice that the disordered solid has a significant stabilizing contribution to the free energy arising from the degeneracy entropy which is not present in the ordered solid .",
    "the small lower value of the internal energy of the ordered solid can not compensate the lost of the large value of the degeneracy entropy ( at least for not to loo temperatures ) .",
    "in this work computer simulations were performed for fully flexible lj chains in the solid phase .",
    "the solid structure considered is based on a face centered cubic ( fcc ) close packing arrangement of atoms .",
    "the initial configuration of the chains is obtained by randomly distributing the molecular bonds of the chains .",
    "the npt simulations of this work provide values of the eos and internal energy of the lj chains in the solid phase .",
    "the chains considered here were formed by @xmath58 monomer units .",
    "the performance of wertheim s tpt1 theory as extended recently to the solid phase was analyzed .",
    "it was found that wertheim s tpt1 provides a very accurate description of the equation of state and residual internal energies of lj chains . in previous work we found good agreement for the simplest case @xmath46 and here it is shown that the agreement is also quite good for longer chains . the performance of the theory does not seem to deteriorate with the length of the chain ( at least for the lengths considered here ) .",
    "the results of this work provide further evidence that wertheim s tpt1 can be used with confidence for fully flexible lj chains in the solid phase .",
    "it was also found that for a fixed temperature the eos and internal energies of lj chains tend to asymptotic limits when plotted as a function of the monomer number density .",
    "this behavior is suggested by wertheim s tpt1 and our simulation results are fully consistent with that behavior .",
    "finally some simulations were also performed for `` linear rigid '' lj chains in an ordered solid ( cp1 structure ) .",
    "we found differences in the thermodynamic properties of fully flexible and `` linear rigid '' chains in the solid phase .",
    "therefore the similarity in thermodynamic properties between fully flexible and `` linear rigid '' chains predicted by wertheim s tpt1 does not hold in the solid phase ( although it holds quite well in the isotropic phase ) .",
    "this work shows that wertheim s tpt1 can be used to accurately describe the thermodynamic properties of fully flexible chains , both in the fluid and in the solid phase .",
