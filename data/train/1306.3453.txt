    "<S> we use a two - orbital double - exchange model including jahn - teller lattice distortions , superexchange interactions , and long - range coulomb ( lrc ) interactions to investigate the origin of magnetically disordered interfaces between ferromagnetic metallic ( fm ) and antiferromagnetic insulating ( afi ) manganites in fm / afi superlattices . </S>",
    "<S> the induced magnetic moment in the afi layer varies non - monotonically with increasing afi layer width as seen in the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we provide a framework for understanding this non - monotonic behavior which has a one - to - one correspondence with the magnetization of the fm interface . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained insights provide a basis for improving the tunneling magnetoresistance in fm / afi manganite superlattices by avoiding a magnetic dead layer ( mdl ) in the fm manganite .    </S>",
    "<S> the fm manganites have emerged as potential candidates for spintronics devices@xcite due to their high spin polarization@xcite . for the future generation of magnetic tunnel junctions ( mtjs ) artificial trilayers of insulating metal oxides sandwiched between fm manganites are currently designed . in mtjs a large tunneling magnetoresistance ( tmr)@xcite is observed by switching the spin orientation in the fm leads from antiparallel to parallel configurations ; the tmr is defined by the ratio @xmath0 where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the resistances for antiparallel and parallel orientations , respectively@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> tmr is a spin dependent process which critically depends on the magnetic and the electronic properties of the interface between fm manganites and the insulating material@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in such a spin sensitive device it is required to have a structurally and magnetically well defined interface . </S>",
    "<S> it is an experimental fact that the magnetization of fm manganites decreases at the interface below its bulk value@xcite , the origin of which is not well understood . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the magnetization at the interface , usually referred to as the ` magnetic dead layer ' ( mdl)@xcite has an adverse effect on the tmr by decreasing the tunneling current , which by itself should be large for device applications . </S>",
    "<S> a recent microscopic analysis@xcite suggests that the decrease of the double - exchange energy at an fm / srtio@xmath3 interface is the origin of the mdl . </S>",
    "<S> the possible coexistence of different magnetic phases at the interface is however not accessible from such an analysis .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the magnetization has been attributed to phase separation , and/or electronic and magnetic reconstructions due to structural inhomogeneities at the interface . unlike at the surface of fm manganites@xcite it is a difficult task to determine the electronic and structural changes at interfaces which are several nanometers below the surface . to minimize disorder and strain effects isostructural interfaces are favorable . in a different approach </S>",

    "<S> it is a priori not clear from the lsmo / pcmo / lsmo superlattices , if mdls at the interface exist for different widths of the pcmo layers .    in this letter , we explore in detail the electronic and magnetic reconstructions of the fm / afi superlattices at the electron density @xmath7 for different widths of the afi layers . </S>",
    "<S> electrons are transferred from the fm to the afi layers at the interface even though the initial electron density in the bulk materials are equal . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of electron transfer from the fm interfacial line depends upon the thickness of the afi layer . </S>",
    "<S> we explain the non - monotonic behavior of the induced ferromagnetic moment in the afi layer with increasing afi layer width and establish explicitly a one - to - one correspondence between the induced magnetic moment in the afi layer and the magnetization at the interface in the fm / afi superlattices . </S>",
    "<S> this concept establishes a route to minimize or even avoid the mdl in fm / afi superlattices .    </S>",
    "<S> we consider a two - dimensional model hamiltonian for manganite superlattices composed of alternating fm and afi regions . </S>",
    "<S> the model and the method we employ have been elaborately discussed in ref .. the model is given by @xmath8 where both @xmath9 and @xmath10 have the same reference hamiltonian @xcite @xmath11    @xmath12 is constructed to qualitatively reproduce the phase diagram in the bulk limit@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> for this reason we use the limit @xmath29@xcite . in an external magnetic field </S>",

    "<S> the afi phase at @xmath7 is a charge and orbital ordered ce phase@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the density of states is finite for the fm phase while it is gapped at the fermi level for the afi phase ; charge transfer from the fm to the afi side is expected when the fm and the afi are joined together .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath78 , in fig.2(c ) , decreases for @xmath90 = 11 - 15 for @xmath79 , @xmath91 in the center lines of the afi layer , which implies that the induced ferromagnetic moment in the afi layer is confined to the near vicinity of the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the induced magnetization and the line - averaged electron density @xmath92 becomes evident in fig.2(d ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath92 for the interfacial line on the fm side , named as fm interfacial line , decreases while the afi interfacial line increases from the initial electron density 0.5 to @xmath930.65 . </S>",
    "<S> the induced ferromagnetic moment for the lines @xmath90 = 9 and 17 is therefore due to the enhanced electron density and the spin bias from the ferromagnetic metal . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , for the parameters @xmath44 , @xmath94 , and @xmath76 the groundstate of the bulk system is a fm . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization in the line @xmath90 = 10 ( 16 ) is induced by the fully magnetized line @xmath90 = 9 ( 17 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the interfacial lines of the afi layer are also magnetized for other @xmath47 values , except for @xmath58 which is discussed later . </S>",
    "<S> the spin bias from the ferromagnetic metal is important for the induction of a ferromagnetic moment in the afi interfacial lines . </S>",
    "<S> the induced magnetization in the afi layer is very small irrespective of the afi layer width where the fm interfacial lines are magnetically disordered@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the direction of electron transfer is from the fm to the afi layer as anticipated earlier . </S>",
    "<S> sufficiently far away from the interface the average electron density must return to the initial electron density @xmath43 , which however is not fully accomplished for @xmath79 and @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> but with the additional lrc interaction @xmath92 indeed gradually returns to the initial electron density ( see fig.2(d ) ) . for @xmath81 </S>",
    "<S> the average electron densities are clearly higher ( lower ) in the fm ( afi ) layers as compared to @xmath50 . in the fm / afi superlattices , where the constituent fm and afi manganites have the same initial electron density </S>",
    "<S> , the lrc interaction reduces the critical width , beyond which @xmath77 starts to decrease@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , @xmath92 at the fm interfacial lines is largely unaltered by the lrc interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the line averaged @xmath78 for @xmath58 is also shown in fig.2(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> but in contrast to the afi layer width @xmath79 , @xmath78 in the fm interfacial line decreases for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the difference results from the decrease in the electron density for @xmath58 in the fm interfacial line as shown in fig.3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the spin pattern in the interfacial line decomposes into fm and g - type af regions . </S>",
    "<S> this is shown in fig.3(b ) which displays the averaged @xmath62 components of the t@xmath59 spins @xmath83 for each site of the fm interfacial line @xmath85 for one selected sample.    the averaged electron density at the fm interfacial line is smaller for @xmath86 as compared to @xmath76 as shown in fig.3(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason the g - type af regions in the fm interfacial line are more pronounced for @xmath86 ( see fig.3(d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the electron densities and the @xmath62 components of the t@xmath59 spins at each site in the fm / afi superlattice are shown in fig.4 for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic and the electronic profile of both fm interfacial lines are similar to each other on both sides of the afi line . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic profile of the afi line is tied to the profile of the fm interfacial lines while the electron density of the sites in the afi layer is enhanced to @xmath930.7 .    with increasingly larger values of @xmath64 the magnetization of the fm interfacial line decreases due to the enhanced g - type correlations for @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> this establishes the crucial relation between the magnetization at the fm interfacial line and the induced magnetic moment in the afi layer . </S>",
    "<S> this is in general true for any width @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> so the non - monotonic behavior of @xmath52 in fig.2(a ) implies that the fm interfacial line remains ferromagnetic for @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> for @xmath60 the decrease in the electron density in the fm interfacial line ( see fig.3(c ) , @xmath76 ) is very small as compared to @xmath58 , and these lines therefore remain ferromagnetic . for @xmath95 the electron density in the fm interfacial line decreases considerably except for @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> the electron density profile for @xmath60 and @xmath95 resembles the profile of @xmath60 and @xmath76 shown in fig.3(c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that the charge transfer across the interface from the fm to the afi layer also varies non - monotonically similar to the induced magnetic moment in the afi layer shown in fig.2(a ) . </S>",
    "<S> the competition between fm and g - type af spin patterns at the interface is controlled by the double - exchange energy gain due to the induced magnetic moment in the afi layer . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of the fm interfacial layer remains ferromagnetic for @xmath60 , i.e. the large induced magnetic moment in the afi layer removes the mdl .    </S>",
    "<S> [ t ]     components of the @xmath17 spins for each site on a 24@xmath9624 superlattice at @xmath75 with the afi layer width @xmath58 ( @xmath48 and @xmath97 ) . </S>",
    "<S> , width=313,height=147 ]    at large electron - phonon couplings @xmath98 electrons are site - localized due to strong lattice distortions ; this decreases the double - exchange energy gain from induced ferromagnetic moments which are hence absent in the afi layer ( see fig.2(a ) ) irrespective of the afi layer width . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason g - type spin patterns are more prominent at the fm interfacial lines and @xmath92 in the fm interfacial line decreases considerably ( see e.g. fig.3(c ) for @xmath60 and @xmath89 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these results suggest that also in fm / nmi superlattices local af correlations may emerge in the fm interfacial line and the magnetization at the interface is wiped out originating in an mdl due to the decrease in the electron density at the interface@xcite .    in the type </S>",
    "<S> i fm / afi superlattices the spins in the fm leads are aligned in the same direction due to the periodic boundary conditions ; this set up mimics the experimental situation in which the fm layers of the superlattice are aligned by an external magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> specifically we have designed the type ii superlattice where two afi layers instead of one are considered as shown in fig.1(b ) to represent more closely the experimental setup . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetizations in the left and the right fm layers are aligned parallel while the middle fm layer is free to choose its spin direction . </S>",
    "<S> a small external magnetic field @xmath30 is applied to align all the fm layers in the same direction . </S>",
    "<S> fig.5(a ) shows the line averaged @xmath92 vs. line index @xmath90 for @xmath58 , @xmath88 , and @xmath99 . in fig.5(b ) , we plot the averaged @xmath100 in the afi layers along with averaged @xmath62 component of the @xmath17 spins in the fm interfacial lines @xmath101 for the same magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of the fm interfacial line follows a non - monotonic behavior similar to the induced magnetic moments in the afi layer . </S>",
    "<S> the dc limit of the longitudinal conductivity @xmath102 , also displayed in fig.5(b ) , as obtained from the kubo - greenwood formula@xcite , follows the same trend with increasing afi layer width @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> it is the combination of the induced magnetic moment in the afi layer and the magnetization of the fm interfacial lines which enhances the conductivity .    </S>",

    "<S> ( b ) @xmath63 , @xmath103 ( see text ) and the dc conductivity ( in units of @xmath104 where a is the lattice spacing , see ref . ) at @xmath75 for different afi layer widths @xmath47 . an external magnetic field @xmath99 is applied to align the fm layers . , width=330,height=132 ]    in the type ii set up the tmr may be calculated by fixing the spins of the middle fm layer in the direction opposite to that of the left and right fm layers . </S>",
    "<S> however in the limit @xmath29 adopted here where the spins of the mobile e@xmath14 electrons are perfectly aligned along the local @xmath17 spin direction the dc conductivity ( resistivity ) for this set up is zero ( infinity ) . </S>",
    "<S> for this reason a quantitative calculation of tmr for different widths @xmath47 of the afi layer is not presented here . in the experiments the resistivity is large but finite in the antiparallel configuration of the fm layers . </S>",
    "<S> the increase of the conductivity in the parallel configuration of the fm layers , shown in fig.5(b ) will necessarily enhance the tmr .    in conclusion , </S>",
    "<S> our 2d model calculations provide a framework to explain the origin of the mdl at the fm interface in fm / insulator superlattices . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of the interfacial lines of the fm layers is determined by the amount of electron transfer from the fm interfacial lines to the afi layer . </S>",
    "<S> the decrease in the magnetization of the fm interface , when joined with a nmi oxide is due to the decrease in the electron density at the interfacial lines as a result of the charge transfer across the interface . </S>",
    "<S> the amount of transferred charge is limited in a scenario for which instead afi layers are sandwiched between fm layers , since inducing ferromagnetic moment in the afi layer requires to control the charge transfer . </S>",
    "<S> but even in such a fm / afi superlattices , the mdl is absent only for a specific range of afi layer widths , because the induced magnetic moment in the afi layer varies non - monotonically with the afi layer width@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the absence of the mdl in fm / afi superlattices enhances the tmr . </S>",
    "<S> the mdl at the interface in an fm / nmi junction may be minimized by the insertion of an intervening afi layer . </S>",
    "<S> in such a setup , the width of the afi layer has to be chosen such that the afi layer is maximally polarized along the direction of the magnetization in the fm layers due to charge transfer . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the tmr is significantly enhanced in the engineered fm / nmi mtjs with an intervening afi layer@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the role of the mdl for different widths of the intervening afi layer in these engineered mtjs deserves further investigation . </S>",
    "<S> we leave this as the subject for future work .    </S>",
