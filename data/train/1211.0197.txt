    "the existence of multi - parton interactions ( mpi ) in high - energy hadronic collisions  @xcite is a natural consequence of the fast increase of the parton flux at small parton fractional momenta @xmath8  @xmath9  @xmath10 and the requirement of unitarization of the cross sections in perturbative quantum chromodynamics ( pqcd )  @xcite . without mpi ,",
    "the pqcd cross sections show a dramatic growth with increasing centre - of - mass energies leading to a violation of unitarity ( @xmath11 ) at momentum transfers as large as @xmath127  gev@xmath13 in proton - proton ( p - p ) collisions at the large hadron collider ( lhc )  @xcite .",

    "although mpi at semi - hard scales of a few  gev are an unambiguous ( experimental and theoretical ) source of particle production in high - energy hadronic collisions , the evidence for double parton scattering ( dps ) processes producing two independently - identified hard particles in the same collision is currently based on relatively indirect measurements ( see below ) .",
    "the study of dps processes provides not only valuable information on the spatial structure of the hadrons  @xcite and on multi - parton correlations in the hadronic wave - function  @xcite , but also a good experimental and theoretical control of the dps final - states is needed in searches of new physics at the lhc ( such as e.g. higgs  @xcite , supersymmetry  @xcite , and w@xmath14w@xmath14 scattering  @xcite ) .",
    "various measurements exist in p - p  and p-@xmath15  collisions which are consistent with dps contributions in multi - jet final - states at @xmath16  =  63  gev  @xcite , 630 gev  @xcite , and 1.8  tev  @xcite ; in @xmath17 + 3-jets events at @xmath16  =  1.8 tev  @xcite and 1.96  tev  @xcite ; and in ( preliminary ) w+2-jets results at @xmath16  =  7  tev  @xcite . such measurements show an excess of events in some differential distributions with respect to the expectations from contributions from single - parton scatterings ( sps ) alone , although with uncertainties related to higher - order sps corrections .",
    "the production of same - sign ww production  with a theoretical cross section with small uncertainties and a characteristic final - state with like - sign leptons plus ( large ) missing transverse energy ( @xmath18 ) from the undetected neutrinos  has no sps backgrounds at the same order in the strong coupling @xmath19 , and has been proposed since various years as a `` smoking gun '' process to univocally signal the occurrence of dps in p - pcollisions  @xcite .    in this paper",

    "in a generic hadron - hadron collision , the inclusive dps cross section from two independent hard parton subprocesses ( @xmath22 ) has been derived in the momentum representation , taking into account the transverse ( impact parameter ) distribution of the partons in the hadrons , using light - cone variables and the same factorization approximations assumed for processes with a single hard scattering  @xcite .",
    "the dps cross section can be written as a convolution of pdfs and elementary cross section summed over all involved partons @xmath23 in this expression , @xmath24 are double parton distribution functions which depend on the longitudinal parton momentum fractions @xmath25 and @xmath26 , and on the transverse position @xmath27 and @xmath28 of the two parton undergoing the hard processes at the scales @xmath29 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 are the parton - level subprocess cross sections , and @xmath33 is the impact parameter vector connecting the centres of the colliding hadrons in the transverse plane .",
    "the factor @xmath34 appears due to the symmetry of the expression for the interchange of @xmath35 and @xmath36 parton species : @xmath37 for indistinguishable and distinguishable parton subprocesses respectively .",
    "the double parton distribution functions @xmath38 encode all the information of interest with regard to multiple parton interactions , and it is typically assumed that they can be decomposed in terms of longitudinal and transverse components @xmath39 where @xmath40 describes the transverse parton density and is supposed to be an universal function for all types of partons with the fixed normalization @xmath41 making the further assumption that the longitudinal components @xmath42 reduce to the `` diagonal '' product of two independent single - parton distribution functions , @xmath43 the cross section of double parton scattering can be finally expressed in the simple generic form @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the standard inclusive single - hard scattering cross section , computable perturbatively to a given order in @xmath19 , @xmath46 and @xmath4 is a normalization cross section associated with the effective transverse overlap area ( [ eq : f ] ) of the partonic correlations that produce the dps process : @xmath47^{-1}\\ , .",

( [ eq : doubleab ] ) , which will be employed hereafter in this work , should actually provide a conservative estimate of the dps cross section for the process under consideration .      in proton - nucleus collisions ,",
    "the parton flux is enhanced by the number @xmath20 of nucleons in the nucleus and  modulo small ( anti)shadowing effects in the nuclear pdf  @xcite , see below  the single - parton cross section is simply expected to be that of proton - proton collisions ( or , more exactly , that of proton - nucleon collisions",

    "the factor @xmath58 is introduced to take into account the difference between the number of nucleon pairs and the number of different nucleon pairs .",
    "the effect of extra `` non - diagonal '' interference terms ( which can not be expressed in terms of parton densities alone ) computed in the case of light nuclei in  @xcite would lead , together with other correlations discussed above , to an increase of the value of @xmath59 , but we believe that these are effectively covered by the current uncertainty @xmath60 , eq .",

    "the final formula for dps in proton - nucleus collisions can be written as a function of the elementary proton - nucleon single - parton cross sections , combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : doubleab ] ) and ( [ eq : doublepa ] ) , as @xmath70 with the normalization effective cross section amounting to @xmath71 where the last equality holds for p - pb  using @xmath20  =  208 , @xmath72  13  @xmath73  2  mb and @xmath68  =  30.4  mb@xmath3 . in summary ,",
    "the dps cross sections are enhanced by a factor of @xmath74  600 in proton - lead compared to proton - proton ( or , in general , nucleon - nucleon ) collisions , i.e. they are a factor of 3 higher than the naive expectation based on the @xmath20-scaling of the single - parton cross sections , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaspspa ] ) .",
    "thus , in general the significance for any dps measurement in p - a  collisions , @xmath75  =  n@xmath76 , will be enhanced by a factor of @xmath77 compared to p - p  collisions , i.e. by a factor of @xmath7840 for p - pb .",
    "one can thus exploit such a large expected dps signal over the sps background in proton - nucleus collisions to study double - parton scattering in detail and in particular to determine the value of @xmath60 , independently of other dps measurements in p - p  collisions  given that the parameter f@xmath79 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sigmaeffppb ] ) depends on the comparatively better known transverse density profile of nuclei .",

    "the interest of like - sign w - boson pair production as a signature of dps in high - energy hadronic collisions is three - fold .",
    "first , all the relevant production cross sections can be computed perturbatively at nlo accuracy and have small theoretical uncertainties .",
    "second , the w@xmath2 production cross sections at the lhc are the highest for any electroweak particle ( z and drell - yan production are comparatively smaller ) , resulting in a potentially observable dps ww cross section .",
    "third , in single - parton scatterings , the same - sign sps processes are suppressed since the lowest order at which two same - sign w bosons can be produced is with two jets ( wwjj )  @xcite , @xmath82w@xmath83w@xmath84 with @xmath85 and @xmath86 which have leading contributions of @xmath87 for the mixed strong - electroweak diagrams , and of @xmath88 for the pure electroweak ( vector - boson fusion ) processes , where @xmath89 is the electroweak coupling .",
    "we compute the same - sign dps signal , @xmath90 , via eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigmappbdpsww])-([eq : sigmaeffppb ] ) with @xmath91  =  1 . the single - parton w cross section @xmath92 entering in the dps expression , as well as the sps same - sign wwjj background ,",
    "are computed at nlo accuracy with the mcfm  code  @xcite ( version 6.2 ) using the central nlo sets of the ct10 pdf  @xcite for the proton and using the eps09 nuclear pdf  @xcite for the pb ion .",
    "the nlo calculations used here reproduce well the experimental single - w  @xcite and w@xmath83w@xmath93  @xcite production cross sections measured in p - p  collisions at @xmath0  =  7  tev , as well as the single - w cross sections in p - p  and pb - pb  at @xmath0  =  2.76  tev  @xcite .",
    "the use of nuclear pdf ( eps09 ) for the lead ion not only takes into account nuclear `` shadowing '' modifications of the bound relative to free nucleons , but it also properly accounts for the different isospin ( u- and d - quark ) content of the lead ion given by its different proton ( z = 81 ) and neutron ( n = 127 ) numbers .",
    "such an effect is important in the case of isospin - sensitive particles like the w boson , and explains the relatively enhanced w@xmath93 ( depleted w@xmath83 ) cross sections measured in pb - pb  with respect to p - p   collisions at @xmath0  =  2.76  tev  @xcite . at 8.8  tev ,",
    "the use of the eps09 nuclear pdf results in a modification of the total w@xmath83 ( w@xmath93 ) production cross section by about -7% ( + 15% ) compared to those obtained for p - p  collisions using the proton ct10 pdf .",
    "the largest impact in the final cross sections is due to the proton - versus - lead isospin differences since nuclear ( anti)shadowing effects alone decrease the integral w@xmath83 and w@xmath93 yields respectively by 4.5% and 3% only  @xcite .",
    "all numerical results are evaluated using the latest standard model input parameters for particle masses , widths and couplings  @xcite .",

    "the background wwjj cross sections in mcfm  are formally computed at lo , but detailed studies  @xcite have shown that the extra nlo corrections can be accounted for by setting the renormalization and factorization scales to @xmath96  =  150  gev . indeed , for such a scale choice the w@xmath83w@xmath83 + 2-jet inclusive lo and nlo cross sections are found to nearly coincide in p - p  at @xmath16  =  14 tev ( @xmath97  =  2.4  fb and @xmath98  =  2.5  fb )  @xcite .",
    "same - sign w - pairs can also be produced via vector - boson - fusion ( vbf ) processes  @xcite , which are not included in the mcfm  package .",
    "we have determined the vbf wwjj contribution at nlo using vbfnlo  @xcite ( version 2.6 ) with the same set of parameters used for mcfm , except that the theoretical scales are set to the momentum transfer of the exchanged w , z boson ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "since vbfnlo  is not interfaced to nuclear pdfs , we use ct10 for both the proton and the pb ion .",
    "this choice introduces a small difference ( below 5% ) in the vbf cross sections according to the results obtained running a similar weak - boson fusion process in mcfm  ( vbf higgs@xmath1w@xmath83w@xmath93 production ) with ct10 and eps09 . the pure vbfnlo  electroweak contributions to the total wwjj cross sections are as large ( or even slightly larger than ) the qcd ( quark- and gluon - mediated ) ones obtained with mcfm  ( table  [ tab:1 ] ) .",
