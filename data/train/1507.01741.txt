    "photoacoustic imaging ( pai ) is a novel imaging technique that allows for three dimensional imaging of small biological or medical specimens with high spatial resolution .",
    "it utilizes that an object expands and emits ultrasound waves when it is exposed to a short pulse of electromagnetic radiation ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the emitted ultrasound is assumed to be proportional to the electromagnetic _ absorption density _ which provides detailed anatomical and functional information .",
    "pai aims for visualization of the absorption density by using measurements of the emitted wave outside of the object",
    ".    opposed to the standard pai problem @xcite we assume a spatially varying speed of sound .",
    "the underlying mathematical model of the wave propagation with spatially varying sound speed @xmath0 is the _ acoustic wave equation _",
    "@xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the absorption density , which is proportional to the absorbed electromagnetic energy",
    ".    the _ inverse problem _ of photoacoustics with variable wave speed consists in determining the function @xmath2 from measurement data @xmath3 of @xmath4 on a surface @xmath5 over time @xmath6 .",
    "that is , it consists in solving the equation @xmath7 with constant sound speed there exists a variety of analytical reconstruction formulas and numerical inversion techniques .",
    "we mention @xcite , see also the surveys @xcite . in the case of inhomogeneous sound speed , exact reconstruction formulas have been derived in @xcite .",
    "a numerical method , providing approximations , is _ time reversal _ @xcite , . thereby the measurement data serve as dirichlet boundary data , and the _ initial _ conditions at final observation time @xmath8",
    "are assumed to be identically zero . on top of the original algorithm of fink @xcite",
    ", the approach in @xcite suggests a harmonic extension of the boundary data at time @xmath8 as initialization data .",
    "the reconstruction obtained by time - reversal , lets say @xmath9 , approximates the true solution @xmath2 as @xmath8 increases to infinity .",
    "the exact @xmath2 can be reconstructed if @xmath10 , which happens , aside from trivial cases , only in odd dimensions and for homogeneous sound speed . in all other cases",
    "the results are error - prone . moreover , this method produces approximations of @xmath2 only under _ non - trapping _ conditions on @xmath11 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "stefanov and uhlmann @xcite showed that if @xmath12 ( where @xmath13 denotes the diameter of @xmath14 with respect to the riemannian metric @xmath15 ) , then an observation time @xmath16 is sufficient for a unique reconstruction of @xmath2 .",
    "however , for stability of the inverse problem one needs longer measurement times and a non - trapping speed of sound condition .",
    "in fact , if the measurement time @xmath8 is larger than a certain threshold , depending on the longest geodesic in the metric induced by @xmath11 , the algorithm presented in @xcite provides a theoretically exact reconstruction in terms of a neumann series that contains multiple , subsequent time reversal and forward propagation of the data term .",
    "a computational realization of this approach has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "this algorithm serves as a benchmark for our proposed algorithm .",
    "the presented approach for pai inversion with variable sound speed relies on linear regularization theory @xcite .",
    "specifically , we obtain regularized convergence to the _ minimum norm solution _ even for short measurement times .",
    "moreover , we obtain a new reconstruction method that does not require an artificial cut - off of the measurement data , nor harmonic extension of the data at the final observation time @xmath8 .    for the numerical computations",
    ", we decouple the wave equation into an interior part ( solved by finite element methods ) , and an exterior part ( with homogeneous sound speed ) that is rewritten in terms of a boundary integral formulation .",
    "we then solve the coupled bem - fem system numerically .",
    "note that by this approach we use exact , non - reflecting boundary conditions @xcite and therefore avoid the necessity of a _ perfectly matched layer _ to deal with the cut - off outside the domain of interest . the results are compared to conventional time reversal and the neumann - series approach .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : direct ] we formulate the direct photoacoustic operator @xmath17 in a suitable choice of function spaces , and derive the adjoint . in section [ sec : landweber ] we give a short overview about landweber iteration and review some regularization results regarding convergence and convergence rates in view of pai reconstruction .",
    "moreover , we discuss the relation to the neumann series approach in @xcite . in section [ sec : fem_bem ] , we formulate the transmission problem for the wave equation used for numerical computation of both the direct and the adjoint problem .",
    "we state the boundary relations used for taking into account the exterior domain .",
    "in addition , we briefly describe the used discretization . finally , section [ sec : results ] provides a comparison of our reconstruction algorithm with the state - of - the - art reconstruction by time reversal and the _ enhanced _ time reversal neumann series method from @xcite .    all along this paper",
