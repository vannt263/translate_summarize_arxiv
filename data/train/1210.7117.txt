    "it is in principle an exact theory , and is able to yield the exact ground state energy and density using a fictitious system of non - interacting electrons .",
    "the key component of ksdft is the exchange - correlation functional .",
    "tremendous progress has been made in the past three decades for constructing approximate exchange - correlation functionals based on the known information from the uniform electron gas  @xcite . however , such approximate exchange - correlation functionals are known to fail for strongly correlated systems , such as the chromium dimer  @xcite or mott - hubbard insulators  @xcite .",
    "several recent studies indicate that the construction of exchange - correlation functionals for general strongly correlated systems can be extremely difficult  @xcite .",
    "recently , the behavior of the exchange - correlation functional has been revealed in the limit of strictly correlated electrons ( sce )  @xcite .",
    "the many - body coulomb repulsive energy of sce determines the _ exact _ exchange - correlation functional in the strong interaction limit , without artificially breaking any symmetry of the system or introducing any tunable parameters .",
    "the information provided by the sce limit is complementary to that provided by the kohn - sham non - interacting kinetic energy . for given electron density profile ,",
    "the sce limit is described by minimizing the many - body coulomb interaction energy with respect to all wavefunctions in a @xmath0 dimensional space , where @xmath1 is the number of electrons in the system , under the additional constraint that the wavefunction is consistent with the electron density  @xcite .",
    "mathematically , this daunting minimization task is an optimal transport problem with coulomb cost function  @xcite .",
    "the optimal transport theory finds the optimal way for transferring masses from one position to another .",

    "little is known about the shape or even the existence of the co - motion functions for general systems including small molecules . on the other hand ,",
    "the optimal transport problem with coulomb cost function can be equivalently solved by its dual formulation , called the kantorovich dual problem  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the kantorovich dual problem is its potential applicability to general systems , ranging from atoms and molecules to condensed matter systems .",
    "however , the kantorovich dual problem is formulated as a maximization problem with an _ infinite _ number of constraints , which is impossible to be implemented directly .",
