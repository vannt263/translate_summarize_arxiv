    "deep spectroscopic surveys recently lead to a major breakthrough in our understanding of global galaxy evolution .",
    "the canada@xmath2france redshift survey ( cfrs ) ( @xcite ) clearly demonstrated an evolution in the galaxy population up to a redshift @xmath14 , which has been confirmed by the autofib survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "data combining observations from the keck telescope and hubble space telescope ( @xcite ) reach the star - forming galaxy population up to @xmath15 . thus , a picture of the star - formation history has emerged from these observations ( @xcite ) , suggesting that the peak of star formation is in the range @xmath16 .",
    "the observed evolution of the galaxy population is closely related to the history of the star - forming galaxies showing spectral emission lines .",
    "careful analysis of their spectra give crucial information about the physical processes occurring in these galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "in the optical wavelength range , the h@xmath0(@xmath17 ) emission - line flux is a direct tracer of recent star formation .",
    "massive , hot , short - lived ob stars emit ultraviolet ( uv ) photons , that ionize the surrounding gas to form an h  ii region , where the recombinations produce spectral emission lines . of the balmer lines ,",
    "h@xmath0 is the most directly proportional to the ionizing uv stellar spectra at @xmath18   ( see @xcite for a review ) , because the weaker balmer lines are much more affected by the equivalent absorption lines produced in stellar atmospheres .",
    "the other commonly observed optical lines such as [ n  ii]@xmath19 , [ s  ii]@xmath20 and [ o  ii]@xmath21 , [ o  iii]@xmath22 depend strongly on the metal fraction present in the gas .",
    "they have higher ionizing potential than the balmer lines , thus depend also on the hardness of the ionizing stellar spectra .",
    "therefore they represent only indirect tracers of recent star formation .    the major factor that affects measurements of the true h@xmath0 emission fluxes",
    "is interstellar extinction .",
    "if galaxies are observed at high galactic latitudes , extinction due to our own galaxy is negligible ( @xmath23 mag ) , hence most extinction is intrinsic to the observed galaxy .",
    "star formation takes place in highly obscured regions , so extinction corrections introduce a major uncertainty in estimating the star formation rate .",
    "however , since optical wavelengths are less obscured than uv wavelengths , h@xmath0 should be a fairly good estimator of recent star formation .",
    "one has to keep in mind that in studies where spectra are obtained for the whole galaxy , the h@xmath0 flux from ob stars is produced by h  ii regions which are distributed throughout both the bulge and disk .",
    "thus the observed line flux has been diluted by the whole stellar and interstellar content of the galaxy .",
    "though line flux measurements depend on the content of an individual galaxy , they allow us to compare populations of galaxies at different cosmic epochs , and so quantify the global physical processes of evolution .",
    "also , if an active nucleus is present in the central region of the galaxy , then the h@xmath0 flux is not correlated directly to forming stars , but is a mixture of both .",
    "line ratio diagrams can usually separate h  ii galaxies from active galaxies . however ,",
    "if the agn ionizing spectrum is soft , then the stellar ionizing flux can dominate , and it is more difficult to separate them . at @xmath24 , the number of agn - like galaxies is roughly @xmath25 of the number of emission - line galaxies ( @xcite , @xcite ) , and so the non - stellar component is not dominant in the global h@xmath0 luminosity measurements . nevertheless at larger redshifts ,",
    "this situation may change if there is a global evolution in the nuclear activity of galaxies .",
    "overall , measuring h@xmath0 fluxes in representative optically - selected galaxy samples at different cosmic epochs is a major step towards the understanding of the evolutionary processes occurring within the galaxy population .",
    "the cfrs provides a preliminary sample for studies of recent star formation .",
    "its wavelength range ( @xmath26  ) allows the measurement of h@xmath0 fluxes in galaxies at @xmath27 .",
    "a full description of the survey has been published in @xcite for the photometry , in @xcite for the spectroscopy , in @xcite for its completeness , and in particular the spectral analysis of the low redshift sample is presented in @xcite ( cfrs - xii ) .",
    "section 2 describes the flux measurements and the h@xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "section 3 discusses the star formation rate at @xmath28 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in section 4 .",
    "the cfrs spectroscopic sample at @xmath29 ( @xmath30 galaxies ) is a fair representation of field galaxies with absolute magnitudes @xmath31 mag  , and with @xmath32 ( see figure  [ fig1 ] .",
    "also see section 2 in cfrs - xii for a detailed description ) . because of the @xmath1-band ( @xmath33  ) selection ,",
    "these galaxies have been selected by light from the old stellar population , rather than on their young stars .",
    "consequently , our sample is less sensitive to galaxies undergoing strong recent star formation than @xmath12- or @xmath34-selected surveys at low-@xmath3 . the wide @xmath1 band of width @xmath35   does not favour galaxies with strong h@xmath0 emission lines .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath36  . @xmath37 out of the @xmath30 spectra to @xmath38 exhibit the blended emission line h@xmath0+[n  ii]@xmath39 ( hereafter h@xmath0+[n  ii ] ) .",
    "we have measured the integrated fluxes , equivalent widths and the corresponding @xmath40 errors for 110 blends ( h@xmath0+[n  ii ] ) with the package splot under iraf / cl . for @xmath41 spectra ,",
    "the blended line could not be properly measured , since it was at the edge of the observed spectral window ; in our statistical analysis , we considered them as not observed .",
    "the @xmath42 errors in line flux are typically @xmath25 , the detection level ranges from @xmath43 to @xmath44 .",
    "thus these errors are not a significant source of uncertainty in our final estimate of the h@xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "rest - frame equivalent widths ( rew ) are within the range @xmath45  , and the mean is @xmath46  .",

    "[ fig2 ] , we show that except for @xmath49 h@xmath0 emitters , the sample has a detection limit of rew at about @xmath50  , and rew measurements are almost all above @xmath51 . at @xmath52 , the line [ o  ii ] can be detected .",
    "rew([o  ii ] ) are in the range @xmath53  , with a mean of @xmath54  .",
    "the cfrs spectra at @xmath55 are limited in rew by the poor spectral resolution , rather than the s / n of the continuum because they are the result of @xmath567 hours exposure time .",
    "the @xmath57 spectra with no detection of ( h@xmath0+[n  ii ] ) do not always show h@xmath0 in absorption , but all of them have the characteristics of absorption - line spectra : strong @xmath58   break , cah&k , h@xmath59 in absorption , g - band , mgi and a very red continuum ( @xmath60 ) .      to obtain the flux in h@xmath0 , we corrected the flux @xmath61(h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] ) from the contribution of the doublet [ n  ii ] where @xmath62\\lambda6583/[n~ii]\\lambda6548 \\sim 3 $ ] . using results from a spectral analysis of the stromlo - apm survey within the same absolute magnitude range as our emission - line galaxies ( @xmath63 ) , we determined values of @xmath64\\lambda6583/h\\alpha$ ] ranging from @xmath65 to @xmath66 according to the strength of rew(h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] ) ( @xcite ) .",
    "this method is in agreement with the trend of the average parameters of [ n  ii]@xmath676583/h@xmath0 , ew(h@xmath0 ) , and  colors of the ucm emission - lines galaxies ( @xcite , tables  1 &  2 ) .",
    "figure  [ fig3]b shows the values we have taken .",
    "where possible we estimated the interstellar extinction at h@xmath0 using the h@xmath0/h@xmath59 balmer decrement .",
    "however , it is difficult to correct for reddening for all spectra because the @xmath36   spectral resolution and stellar absorption mean that h@xmath59 is not always seen in emission .",
    "we were able to measure the h@xmath59 integrated fluxes for @xmath68 spectra .",
    "for those spectra where we could make a @xmath51 measurement for h@xmath59 ( @xmath36 spectra ) , the extinction @xmath69 has been measured in the following way .",

    "we point out that although the different extinction laws are different in the uv , they behave similarly in the visible , hence our results are independent of the choice made . for these @xmath36 spectra , @xmath77 . for the other @xmath78 spectra with h@xmath59 in emission ,",
    "the average @xmath69 is @xmath79 , or @xmath80 if a @xmath81   stellar absorption is accounted for at h@xmath59 ; we retained the latter value .",
    "for @xmath50 spectra , we could not measure h@xmath59 because of a sky line near it , and for the @xmath82 remaining , h@xmath59 is not detected in emission , probably because of stellar absorption . for these @xmath83 spectra , we decided to apply a correction of @xmath84 , corresponding to a reddening parameter @xmath85 mag ( @xmath86 , @xcite ) , which is the average value measured by @xcite in nearby emission - line galaxies .",

    "the @xmath89 spectral slits of the cfrs did not always contain the whole galaxy .",
    "to have consistent data , we corrected our fluxes by an aperture correction . for this , we integrated the spectral flux in the v band , and transformed it into magnitudes .",
    "the spectrophotometric flux calibration across the spectra is generally accurate to better than @xmath25 ( see e.g. figure 9 in @xcite ) .",

    "they are due to the facts that the color @xmath93 should be the one measured in the spectral slit , and not in a @xmath94 aperture ; and that the true continuum level at h@xmath0 may not be exactly the mean value given by the @xmath1-band magnitude .",
    "these discrepancies are much smaller than our poisson errors , so they do not affect our results on the h@xmath0 luminosity function .",
    "another point is that according kennicutt ( 1983 ) , the h@xmath0 nuclear emission ( h  ii region complexes in the inner disk and bulge regions ) is , in general , rarely significant in comparison with the h@xmath0 emission from the whole galaxy .",
    "hence , our aperture corrections should not overestimate the h@xmath0 measurements , even in the cases of starburst nuclei .",
    "finally , the h@xmath0 luminosity in erg s@xmath7 is given by : @xmath105 where @xmath61(h@xmath0 ) is the integrated flux in erg s@xmath7 @xmath102 , @xmath106 is the luminosity distance in mpc .",
    "figure  [ fig4 ] shows the comoving h@xmath0 luminosity density estimated from our raw data , and from the data after applying each of the corrections described in section 2 .",

    "we plotted the comoving densities at the barycenter of the @xmath119 of the @xmath120 data belonging to the interval @xmath121 $ ] .",
    "the density error bars are poisson errors ; @xmath122",
    ". figure  [ fig4 ] shows also the schechter ( 1976 ) fit to the local h@xmath0 luminosity function ( lf ) measured by @xcite ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath125 erg s@xmath7 ) .",
    "note that we used the @xmath107 based on the @xmath92 magnitudes , since the galaxy selection is based on this measurement .",
    "for the lowest rew , our measurements are not absolutely complete , and so we should , in principle , include this effect in our estimates of @xmath107 . in practice",
    ", there is a strong correlation between l(h@xmath0 ) and @xmath126 ( see figure  [ fig5]b ) , which means that @xmath107 should be only slightly smaller in these cases .",
    "we expect the difference in @xmath107 to be small , since lines with low rew are observable even at our maximum redshift , @xmath127 , as can be seen in figure  [ fig3]d .",
    "an extreme upper limit to this effect can be obtained by artificially setting @xmath10)=5 $ ] (roughly @xmath128 ) , or @xmath129   for our non h@xmath0-emitting galaxies ( 15% of the sample ) . then using the i@xmath130 magnitudes",
    ", we can obtain an approximate flux in h(@xmath0)+[n  ii ] , that we also corrected for n@xmath131 , c ( taken as 0.45 ) , and aperture as described in section 2.2 .",
    "the lf we obtained in both cases is within the poisson error bars of our actual results .",
    "as these @xmath57 galaxies are very red , a small ew does not produce a small l(h@xmath0 ) , so they do not produce a steeper lf at the faint end .",
    "thus , our estimated lf is quite stable .",
    "we fitted our overall h@xmath0 lf in figure  [ fig4]d , with a schechter function , and the best - fitting parameters given by a weighted minimum @xmath132 are @xmath133 , @xmath134 mpc@xmath8 , @xmath135 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "if we exclude the faintest bin from the fit which contains only four galaxies , we find : @xmath136 the quoted errors are the formal @xmath132 fit standard deviations , assuming the parameters are uncorrelated .",
    "in fact , these three parameters are highly correlated , so the formal errors are not realistic estimates ; the difference between these two fits give a realistic estimate of the true errors .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] shows that at different redshifts , our survey does not sample exactly the same range of absolute magnitudes . in principle",
    ", this could affect our lf , so we calculated the h@xmath0 lf using only the galaxies at @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , i.e. where the data constitute an homogeneous subsample .",
    "the result is shown in figure  [ fig5]a and we can see that the resulting densities are entirely consistent with our fitted lfs .    our h@xmath0 lf at @xmath55 samples fainter h@xmath0 luminosities than the @xcite lf ; their lowest data is above @xmath139 erg s@xmath7 , ours is at @xmath140 erg s@xmath7 .",
    "on the other hand , the ( @xmath141 ) cfrs limit and ( @xmath24 ) cut lead to a small volume where we sample bright galaxies with @xmath142 mag .",
    "according to figure  [ fig5]b , this corresponds to @xmath143 erg s@xmath7 which explains the large statistical error on our brightest h@xmath0 luminosity bin .",
    "also our sample contains a larger proportion of emission - line galaxies with @xmath144rew(h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] )",
    "@xmath145  .",
    "this can be seen in comparing figures  9 &  10 in @xcite , and our figures  [ fig3]c and [ fig3]d .",
    "although it may be expected that blue galaxies correspond to star - forming galaxies , figure  [ fig5]c shows that there is not a clear correlation between the @xmath146 color of a galaxy and @xmath147(h@xmath0 ) in our sample .",
    "there is however , a trend seen in figure  [ fig5]e , implying blue galaxies tend to have higher rew(h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] ) .",
    "the latter is in agreement with figure  10 in kennicutt ( 1983 ) , which plots rew(h@xmath0 + [ n  ii ] ) against colors for a nearby sample of sa - irr galaxies .",
    "these figures show that rew(h@xmath0 ) is sensitive to the ratio of ionizing stars ( which produce h@xmath0 ) to lower mass red giant stars ( which produce the stellar continuum at h@xmath0 ) .",
    "on one hand , this means that we have detected red   galaxies which show both low and high h@xmath0 fluxes , and that these contribute to the overall luminosity as well as the blue galaxies , for which emission lines are easier to detect because of a lower stellar continuum at h@xmath0 . following the terminology in @xcite , these red galaxies are likely to correspond to starbust nuclei galaxies ( sbn ) if h@xmath0 is bright , and to dwarf amorphous nuclear starbursts ( dans ) when @xmath148 .",
    "both classes are spiral galaxies . according to @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "they represent @xmath149 of emission - line galaxies , the remaining being spectrally classified as h  ii galaxies , blue compact galaxies , or active galaxies .    on the other hand",
    ", the lack of a correlation between h@xmath0 luminosities and continuum colors means that h@xmath0 production is independant of the overall stellar content , and depends only on the recent star formation .",
    "the observed @xmath93 at @xmath150 is rest - frame @xmath151 which may be significantly reddened .",
    "however the typical reddening is @xmath152 mag which would not make blue galaxies appear as red as we observe .",
    "the independence of l(h@xmath0 ) on total stellar content can also be seen in the fact that red galaxies classified in class ( b ) by @xcite often show spectral features proving the presence of a dominant old stellar population ( cah&k , g - band , mgi ; see figure  1 of @xcite ) .",
    "so , we suspect that some red galaxies show recent star formation similar to blue galaxies .    figure  [ fig5]b shows a tight relation between @xmath34 luminosities and @xmath12 luminosities , both of which being closely related to recent star formation .",
    "a least squares fit gives : @xmath153 if this relation holds at higher redshifts , @xmath154 , we would expect that the high-@xmath3 cfrs galaxies , which are brighter than @xmath155 in @xmath12 , should exhibit stronger h@xmath0 emission lines than those observed locally .",
    "this is in agreement with the results of @xcite who found a large increase in the comoving [ o  ii ] luminosities up to @xmath156 in the cfrs ( [ o  ii ] luminosities being indirectly related to h@xmath0 luminosities ) .",
    "we integrated our best - fit luminosity function to give the overall comoving luminosity density at @xmath158 : @xmath159 we then find a total h@xmath0 luminosity per unit volume ranging from @xmath160 to @xmath161 erg  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath8 at @xmath157 from our two previous lf best fits .",
    "the errors quoted here are the standard deviations taking into account that the three schechter parameters are correlated , and so should be realistic estimates .",
    "our value is @xmath162 to @xmath163 times higher than the value of @xcite at @xmath164 ( @xmath165 , see errata , 1996 , , 459 , l43 ) .",
    "consequently , our result shows that the star formation rate ( sfr ) is higher at @xmath157 than that found in the local universe for galaxies with @xmath166)\\gtrsim 10 $ ]  .",
    "figure  [ fig6 ] shows our data and the local measurements in the sfr vs. z plot from madau et al .",
    "( 1997 ) assuming a salpeter ( 1955 ) imf including stars in the mass range @xmath167 m@xmath168 .",
    "we used their conversion @xmath169 , based on the stellar population synthesis models of @xcite .",
    "the other points in this plot are from rest - frame uv continuum measurements .",
    "the comparison between the uv and h@xmath0 results is not straightforward for the following reasons .",
    "as noted in the introduction , h@xmath0 fluxes come from ionized gas surrounding ob stars , so are directly correlated to short - lived stars , once dust corrected with the balmer decrement .",
    "the uv continuum comes from both short- and long - lived stars ; the long - lived ( late b , a0 ) stars contribute more to the uv continuum at larger uv wavelengths .",
    "in addition , @xcite pointed that longer - lived non - ionizing stars are likely to be found in less obscured regions , than ionizing stars .",
    "this agrees with observations of starbursts where the extinction obtained with the balmer decrement is found to be higher than the extinction obtained from uv continuum ( @xcite ) .",
    "given that uv photons are more obscured than h@xmath0 photons , we expect that uv data should be less correlated to short - lived stars than h@xmath0 data .",
    "overall , converting h@xmath0 luminosities to sfr depends less sensitively on the dust correction than on the assumed imf .",
    "converting uv luminosities to sfr depends less sensitively on imfs in a standard cosmology ( @xcite ) , than on uncertain dust extinction .    in figure  [ fig6 ] ,",
    "the h@xmath0 data are reddening corrected , while uv data are not , thus h@xmath0 data must give higher values of star formation rate , than their counterpart in the uv .",
    "@xcite measured an _ effective _ dust extinction law from a sample of extended regions such as the central regions of starburst and blue compact galaxies .",
    "their law is characterized by the absence of a 2175   dust feature .",
    "assuming @xmath170 mag , it predicts an average dust extinction at @xmath35  , that is @xmath171 times more in flux than at h@xmath0 . @xcite",
    "have a preliminary measurement of the uv(@xmath35  ) density at @xmath172 , and find it is consistent with the uv(@xmath173  ) cfrs data ( @xcite ) .",
    "according to the results from @xcite , our balmer decrement reddening of @xmath170 mag , would imply that the uv stellar continuum at @xmath35 and @xmath173   has an extinction of @xmath174 and @xmath129 mag respectively .",
    "thus , our sfr result at @xmath158 seems to be consistent with the uv(@xmath35  ) data at @xmath175 , and the uv(@xmath173  ) data at @xmath176 within the error bars .",
    "we constructed an optically - selected h@xmath0 luminosity function at @xmath177 ; this will be useful as a comparison to future near - infrared spectroscopic surveys which will detect h@xmath0 in galaxies near the expected peak of sfr .",
    "we find a total h@xmath0 luminosity at least twice than the one measured in the local universe by @xcite for galaxies with @xmath166)\\gtrsim 10 $ ]  .",
    "if the sfr evolution follows an @xmath178 law , then @xmath179 should decrease by a factor @xmath180 from @xmath9 to @xmath181 .",
    "this factor is marginally outside the @xmath40 errors , and may suggest that the local h@xmath0 density is low by @xmath182 .",
    "this may correspond to the local under - density seen in optical redshift surveys ( see @xcite ) .",
    "if the local estimate is correct then it implies an evolution proportional to @xmath183 .",
    "since the number of hydrogen ionizing photons ( @xmath18  ) emitted by a star is proportional to the h@xmath0 recombination line , the total flux in h@xmath0 is a good tracer of the number of ionizing stars within emission - line galaxies .",
    "the imf introduces uncertainties in the relation between h@xmath0 luminosity and star formation rate ; h@xmath0 traces only the massive , hot , short - lived stars , and therefore assumptions on the remaining fraction of cooler stars have to be made .",
    "also , since star formation takes place in highly obscured regions , newly formed stars are not detected in the uv or optical observations .",
    "taking the sfr factor conversions from madau ( 1997 ) , our result is consistent with uv data corrected for @xmath11 mag of dust extinction .",
    "larger dust corrections would imply either an imf with a shallower slope than the one from salpeter , or an underestimation of the total h@xmath0 luminosity .",
    "however we are aware that uncertainties in models and in uv dust extinction are still large .",
    "another interesting result is the strong correlation observed between the flux emitted in the rest - frame @xmath12-band and @xmath34 luminosity . applying this relation to the cfrs where the rest - frame @xmath12-band is directly observed at @xmath184 ,",
    "the range of sampled magnitudes suggests that all emission - line galaxies should be strong h@xmath0 emitters .",
    "this is in agreement with @xcite who find an increase of the comoving number of [ o  ii ] cfrs emitters by a factor at least @xmath117 up to @xmath156 .",
    "this correlates with the evolution seen in the cfrs lfs , which is due to these bright , star - forming galaxies . at high redshifts ,",
    "deep spectroscopic surveys clearly become biased toward strong emission - line , dust - free emitters , which contribute to the increase of the total luminosity of these galaxies at earlier epochs , however they may be only the tip of the iceberg of all h@xmath0 emitters .",

    "<S> we have measured the h@xmath0+[n  ii ] fluxes of the @xmath1-selected canada@xmath2france redshift survey ( cfrs ) galaxies lying at a redshift @xmath3 below @xmath4 , and hence derived the h@xmath0 luminosity function . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude limits of the cfrs mean that only the galaxies with @xmath5 mag were observed at these redshifts . </S>",
    "<S> we obtained a total h@xmath0 luminosity density of at least @xmath6 erg s@xmath7 mpc@xmath8 at a mean @xmath9 for galaxies with rest - fame @xmath10)\\gtrsim 10 $ ]  . </S>",
    "<S> this is twice the value found in the local universe by @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our h@xmath0 star formation rate , derived from madau ( 1997 ) is higher than the uv observations at same @xmath3 , implying a uv dust extinction of @xmath11 mag . </S>",
    "<S> we found a strong correlation between the h@xmath0 luminosity and the absolute magnitude in the @xmath12-band : @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> this work will serve as a basis of future studies of h@xmath0 luminosity distributions measured from optically - selected spectroscopic surveys of the distant universe , and it will provide a better understanding of the physical processes responsible for the observed galaxy evolution .    accepted for publication in _ astrophysical journal _ </S>"
