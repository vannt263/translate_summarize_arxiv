    "a graph @xmath0 is said to be a covering graph over a graph @xmath1 if there exists a surjective homomorphism ( called a covering ) @xmath2 such that for every vertex @xmath3 of @xmath0 the set of edges incident with @xmath3 is mapped bijectively onto the set of edges incident with @xmath4 .",
    "a covering @xmath5 is @xmath6-fold if the preimage of every vertex of @xmath1 consists of @xmath6 vertices .    to simplify the description of large graphs ,",
    "the concept of _ voltage graphs _ and _ covering graphs _ is generally used , see for example  @xcite or  @xcite .    in 1982",
    "leighton proved in @xcite that any two graphs with a common universal cover have a common finite cover .",
    "it is not hard to see that any two graphs with a common cover have a unique maximal common cover : the universal cover . in this note",
    "we show that the result does not extend in the opposite direction .",
    "there are graphs with a common cover whose minimal common cover is not unique .",
    "the _ kronecker cover _ of @xmath1 is the @xmath7-covering graph over @xmath1 with voltages @xmath8 on all edges ( note that in this case the direction of edges is irrelevant ) .",
    "we will denote the kronecker cover of @xmath1 by @xmath9 .",
    "alternatively , @xmath9 can be defined as the tensor product of @xmath1 and @xmath10 .",
    "see  @xcite for more about graph products .",
    "it is easy to see the following properties of @xmath9 .",
    "kronecker covers of graphs are bipartite . if @xmath1 is bipartite , then @xmath9 consists of two copies of @xmath1 .",
    "if @xmath1 is connected and non - bipartite then @xmath9 is connected .    by definition ,",
    "the vertex set @xmath11 is a union of two sets @xmath12 and the edges of @xmath9 connect only vertices in different copies of @xmath12 .",
    "it follows from the theory of tensor products developed by imrich et al . that @xmath13 does not necessarily imply @xmath14",
    "recently , imrich et al . have determined all possibilities for a hypercube @xmath15 to be a kronecker cover .",
    "the desargues graph @xmath16 is a kronecker cover of petersen graph @xmath17 and of the graph @xmath18.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   the desargues graph @xmath16 is a kronecker cover of petersen graph @xmath17 and of the graph @xmath18.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]    here we open the problem for all simple graphs .    given a connected , simple graph @xmath19 , determine all simple graphs @xmath1 such that @xmath20 .",
    "clearly , not all graphs can be kronecker covers .",
    "here is a simple criterion for a graph @xmath19 to be kronecker cover .",
    "let @xmath19 be bipartite with bipartition @xmath21 and let @xmath22 be a fixed - point free involution such that @xmath23 interchanges the bipartition : @xmath24 furthermore , we require that for any vertex @xmath3 of @xmath19 vertices @xmath3 and @xmath25 are non - adjacent .",
    "such an automorphism is called a _ ( combinatorial ) polarity_.    let @xmath19 be a connected graph . then @xmath19 is a kronecker cover of some graph @xmath1 if and only if @xmath19 is bipartite and there exists a polarity @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath26 denote the set of all polarities of @xmath19 .",
    "clearly if @xmath23 is a polarity and @xmath27 an arbitrary automorphism , then @xmath28 is also a polarity , because every automorphism either fixes or interchanges the bipartition .",
    "let @xmath29 denote the class @xmath30 .",
    "if we define an equivalence relation @xmath31 in @xmath32 so that @xmath23 is equivalent to @xmath33 if and only if there exists an @xmath34 such that @xmath35 then the equivalence classes are exactly of the form @xmath36    let @xmath19 be a connected graph . then @xmath19 is a kronecker cover of @xmath6 simple graphs if and only if @xmath37 .",
    "let us consider the case presented in figure  [ fig_1 ] .",
    "the desargues graph @xmath16 can be represented as a kronecker covering graph in two distinct ways .",
    "let us label the vertices of petersen graph @xmath17 in such a way that the vertices in the outer pentagon are labeled 1,2,3,4,5 and the vertices in the inner pentagram 6,7,8,9,10 with 1 being adjacent to 6 , 2 to 7 , etc .",
    "the labeling of the vertices of the bipartite @xmath16 is chosen in such a way that the vertex @xmath38 of petersen lifts to a black vertex @xmath38 and a white vertex @xmath39 .",
    "each pair @xmath38 and @xmath39 of vertices is antipodal in @xmath40 in order to specify the second quotient , the graph @xmath18 we have to define a new polarity @xmath23 of @xmath16 that tells which black vertex @xmath41 projects onto the vertex @xmath38 of @xmath18 .",
    "we do this with the aid of an involution @xmath27 if @xmath17 defined by @xmath42 with four fixed points by setting @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "if we now identify @xmath45 with @xmath38 we obtain a covering projection of @xmath16 onto the graph @xmath18 labelled in the following order along the hamilton cycle of the graph on the right side of figure 1 : @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the two triangles .",
    "more generally we have the following proposition .",
    "let @xmath27 be an involution of a graph @xmath1 that does not interchange the endpoints of an edge , then @xmath43 and @xmath44 is a polarity of @xmath9 .",
    "the graphs @xmath49 and @xmath50 have more than one common connected double cover.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]   the graphs @xmath49 and @xmath50 have more than one common connected double cover.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "it is well - known that if two graphs share a common cover then they have the same universal cover , that is the largest possible connected cover of the two graphs .",
    "here we show that the converse problem , namely finding the least common cover may have more than one solution .",
    "let @xmath1 and @xmath51 be disjoint connected graph .",
    "let @xmath52 be a graph composed from @xmath1 and @xmath51 adding an edge that connects some vertex of @xmath1 to some other vertex of @xmath51 .",
    "this operation depends on the choice of vertices , bit we will indicate the choice simply by referring to the figure .",
    "let @xmath53 and @xmath54 be any two double covers of @xmath1 and @xmath51 respectively .",
    "then there is a unique way to extend this to a double cover of @xmath52 that we shall denote by @xmath55 .",
