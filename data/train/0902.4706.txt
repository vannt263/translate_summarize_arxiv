    "after many years of preparations and constructions , the large hadron collider at cern will start its operation soon .",
    "one of the most important questions the lhc should provide an answer to is related to the nature of the electroweak gauge symmetry breaking . in the standard model ( sm ) it",
    "is achieved by adding a doublet of higgs fields and arranging the parameters such that the symmetry is spontaneously broken .",
    "although the sm is extremely successful in describing the experimental data , there are many arguments suggesting that it can not be the ultimate theory ,  the sm higgs sector is unnatural  can not explain why the electroweak scale is so small with respect to the planck scale ; the sm can not account for the matter - antimatter asymmetry of the universe , nor for the dark matter in fact , the above shortcomings point towards a new physics at the tev scale .    among many propositions for solving part of these problems in the physics area beyond the standard model , supersymmetry ( susy )",
    "is generally considered most elegant and respected . not invented or designed to",
    ", it can accommodate or explain some of the outstanding problems of the sm : stabilizing the gap between electroweak and planck scale , unifying the gauge couplings , inducing radiative electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "it provides a candidate for dark matter ( dm ) , offers new ideas on the matter - antimatter asymmetry , while its unique mathematical structure can provide a link to physics at the gut / planck scale and , in local form , paving the path to gravity .    in the simplest n=1 supersymmetric extension of the sm ,",
    "each sm particle is paired with a sparticle that differs in spin by half a unit . since",
    "none of the sparticles has been seen so far , the supersymmetric lagrangian must be supplemented by susy breaking terms that keep unseen superpartners out of experimental reach while retaining renormalizability and maintaining perturbatively stable hierarchy of scales .",
    "experimental constraints , mainly from flavor and higgs physics , limit the allowed parameter space and play an increasingly restrictive role in building models of susy breaking .    however , the successes of supersymmetry do not rely on its simplest realization .",
    "in fact , non - minimal realizations may ameliorate the flavor problem .",
    "for example , dirac gauginos ( in contrast to majorana in the mssm ) forbid some of the couplings and often lead to additional suppression of contributions from loops with gauginos in flavor - changing processes .",
    "such scenarios can be based on d - term supersymmetry breaking models @xcite or continuous r - symmetries @xcite .",
    "a dirac gaugino requires additional fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "they can be provided by adding a chiral super - multiplet in the adjoint representation of the gauge group @xcite . here",
    "we will present elements of the phenomenology of the scalar partner of the dirac gluino ( sgluon ) , as worked out in a recent paper  @xcite [ and confronted with ref .",
    "in the mssm gluinos are majorana fields with two degrees of freedom to match gluons in the color - octet vector super - multiplet . to provide the two additional degrees of freedom for dirac fields , the usual n=1 gluon / gluino vector super - multiplet @xmath0 may be paired with an additional n=1 color - octet chiral super - multiplet @xmath1 of extra gluinos and scalar @xmath2 fields to a vector hyper - multiplet of n=2 supersymmetry .",
    "[ similarly , the electroweak sector , not to be discussed here , is supplemented by additional su(2)@xmath3 and u(1)@xmath4 super - multiplets . ] the n=2 mirror ( s)fermions are assumed to be very heavy in order to avoid chirality problems .",
    "this hybrid model expands to n=2 only in the gaugino sector  @xcite .",
    "standard mssm @xmath5 and new gluinos @xmath6 couple minimally to the gluon field @xmath7 +            \\overline{\\tilde{g } ' } \\gamma^{\\mu } [ { g}_{\\mu } , { \\tilde{g } ' } ] ) \\ , ,    \\label{eq : gluino}\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the qcd coupling , the fields being color - octet matrices (  @xmath9 with the gell - mann matrices @xmath10 ) ; @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two 4-component majorana spinor fields .",
    "quark and squark fields interact only with the standard gluino , @xmath11 since only their hyper - multiplet partners ( assumed to be heavy ) couple to @xmath6 , as required by n=2 supersymmetry .",
    "soft supersymmetry breaking generates masses for the gluino fields @xmath5 and @xmath6 , @xmath12 diagonal terms are induced by the individual majorana mass parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 while an off - diagonal term corresponds to the dirac mass .",
    "diagonalization gives rise to two majorana mass eigenstates , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , with masses @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "there are two limiting cases of interest : in the limit @xmath19 the standard mssm gluino is recovered ; in the limit of vanishing majorana mass parameters @xmath13 and @xmath14 with @xmath20 , the mixing is maximal and the two majorana gluino states are paired to a dirac state , @xmath21    dirac gluinos are characteristically different from majorana gluinos ; for detailed discussion we refer to @xcite . here",
    "we present one example from  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : d / m ] , where the partonic cross sections for different - flavor squark production @xmath22 mediated by the gluino t - channel exchange are plotted as a function of a dirac / majorana control parameter  @xmath23 , assuming partonic center - of - mass energy @xmath24 gev , @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 gev .",

    "for equal @xmath33 and @xmath34 masses , @xmath35 are non - zero in the majorana limit but vanish in the dirac , while @xmath36 reaches the same value in both limits .",
