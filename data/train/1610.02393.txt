    "feynman presented the nature of wave mechanics based on his picture of path integral @xcite .",
    "the value of a wave function which is a complex number at a position is determined by the summation of all contributions of the paths from every point in the space @xcite . in his lecture for an ordinary audience @xcite",
    ", he showed the behavior of the light ray stemmed from a point to another point along the line of his picture and the picture reproduces the fermat principle of the light .",
    "though feynman described nature of the quantum mechanics , the natural correspondence between quantum mechanics and optics as wave mechanics @xcite also shows that nature of light is coherence and the interference effect naturally appear .",
    "a path from a point to another point , in one - dimensional case , consists of transmittance and reflectance at each point and the complex value is determined for each path . by summing the complex values over all possibilities of paths , the value of the wave function at a point is determined . in optics ,",
    "the transmittance and reflectance in a one - dimensional system is described by a matrix called transfer matrix .",
    "light has a finite speed and the scattering each point reproduces the finite speed of light .",
    "recently such a picture is obtained in the quantum walk mathematically .",
    "the reviews for developments of the theory of quantum walk are , for example , kempe @xcite , kendon @xcite , venegas - andraca @xcite , konno @xcite , manouchehri and wang @xcite , portugal @xcite .",
    "konno analytically showed that the homogeneous scattering by hadamard type transfer matrix at each point forms the wavefront in the quantum walk @xcite .",
    "it could be interpreted as a rigorous mathematical proof of the explanation of feynman s lecture @xcite .",
    "quantum walk provides the nature of the wave mechanics , in which the complex number plays a crucial role .",
    "as the probability density corresponds to the intensity of light , the results of quantum walks exhibit the coherent nature , the existence of the wavefront , and the fermat principle of light in a one - dimensional system as in sec.[sec : optics ] .    on the other hand , when we consider coloring of the colored materials , e.g. , paint , ink in a media , colored fabric and so on ,",
    "the color is determined by the diffusive reflection of the light with the spectrum of visible rays , or more precisely , with the distribution of intensity on the visible wavelengths .",
    "the incident white rays with flat spectrum penetrates into a colored material and then some of its spectrum are absorbed and scattered .",
    "we observe the out - going diffusive reflection colored rays whose distribution of the intensity on the visible wavelengths differs from the white one .",
    "the kubelka - munk model which is a one - dimensional model describes well the nature of coloring of diffusive reflection of the optical rays except structure color .",
    "we decompose the white ray to each monochromatic ray of each wavelength and the behavior of each monochromatic ray is governed by a differential equation @xcite ( see appendix ) . in the equation , we handle the light intensity of a fixed spectrum as a real number rather than a complex number at each point . in other words , in the model , coherence and interference of the light are neglected though coherence is the most important nature of the light as mentioned above it implies that in the coloring , the real valued intensity plays much more important roles than complex valued properties of the coherence .",
    "the real valued ray is based on the diffusive light theory @xcite .",
    "light is scattered by small particles and voids in the media many times , e.g. , following the mie scattering theory and absorbed by colored materials .",
    "it is said that these scattering and absorption make the coherent light forget its coherence and become the diffusive light .",
    "it is a natural question when the optical wave forgets its coherence .",
    "we numerically consider this problem using the quantum walk and the correspondence between the quantum mechanics and optics as in sec.[sec : optics ] .",
    "one of the answer was obtained by ribeiro , milman , and mosseri @xcite , mackay , bartlett , stephenson and sanders @xcite and kempe @xcite .",
    "they studied the quantum random walk which is a model of the quantum walk with randomized transfer matrices .",
    "the randomized transfer matrices cause the quantum walk to lose its coherence of wave nature and we have the diffusive and localized distributions .",
    "however they assumed that the matrices change their value randomly in space and time .",
    "the assumption differs from the above situation .",
    "small particles , voids and colored materials in a solid are static .",
    "recently konno gave an interesting fact on the localization in a quantum walk @xcite that a single transmission matrix causes the localization of the density .",
    "we call the matrix b - impurity as in sec [ sec : qw ] .    in this article",
    ", we employ this model and consider the transmission matrices which consist of the random b - impurities in the homogeneous material .",
    "we set sufficiently many b - impurities uniformly randomly in homogeneous hadamard matrices as a background , whose density @xmath0 in 6000 points .",
    "mathematically it means the poisson point process of the localized matrix of the b - impurity in the homogeneous material .",
    "we fix these transmission matrices and consider quantum walks over them .",
    "these impurities are static like the voids , the small particles in the solid .",
    "it implies one of disordered models of quantum walk @xcite .",
    "there we numerically show that such impurities suppress the coherent nature and the distribution of the quantum walks behaves like diffusive one .",
    "in other words , we provide a new phenomena of the connection between the coherency and diffusive nature of optical wave using the quantum walk .",
    "the contents in this article is as follows : sec [ sec : qw ] gives a brief review of the quantum walks including the recent results of localization , which we call a- and b- impurities , @xcite . in sec [ sec : optics ] , we interpret the models and results in quantum walks as optical systems .",
