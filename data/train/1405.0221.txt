    "the recent report @xcite on a possible significant nonzero b - mode polarization has attracted a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "one of the important implications of this result is that the universe once had vacuum energy density at the order of the grand unification ( gut ) scale , @xmath2 .",
    "even though this report has to be proved being consistent with the previous planck data on the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath3 @xcite , just the existence of a gut scale vacuum energy density constrains many theoretical ideas suggested so far .",
    "in particular , this _ high scale inflation _ answers to a long - standing question in axion cosmology ,  has the peccei - quinn ( pq ) symmetry breaking occurred before or after the inflationary epoch ? \"    the hottest current issue @xcite is the reported large @xmath3 near @xmath4 @xcite for which a trans - planckian vacuum expectation value ( vev ) of inflaton is needed for a large @xmath5-folding @xcite .",
    "models leading to a trans - planckian inflaton vev are the kim - nilles - peloso model @xcite and n - flation @xcite , which belong to a category of natural inflation @xcite .",
    "actually , another very interesting method from a string compactification view has been suggested recently for a trans - planckian vev from a discrete symmetry principle @xcite .",
    "next hot issue is the _ high scale inflation_. it seems that the pq phase transition has occurred after ( or at least at the end phase of ) the inflation , and a possible scenario of the axion cosmology has been already scrutinized if cold dark matter ( cdm ) of the universe is 100% axion @xcite .",
    "the issue of the topological objects in axion models , domain walls @xcite and strings , has been discussed for a long time @xcite to compare with the cdm axion energy density arising from the misalignment mechanism @xcite .",
    "it has been pointed out that the axion domain wall number @xmath6 should be one so that the energy density of axion walls does not overclose the universe @xcite .",
    "after axion gets a significant mass , the axion wall system is quickly erased if @xmath7 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwone ] .",
    "after axion strings are created , the axion string - wall system is assumed to have a scale invariant form @xcite , and small scale walls surrounded by strings collide with the horizon scale string - wall system , effectively annihilating it .",
    "so , at present there is no energy crisis problem if @xmath7 . with @xmath7 ,",
    "the radiated axion spectrum from the string - wall system has been numerically estimated to give @xmath8 @xcite , where @xmath9 is the ratio of axions from radiation to the axions from the misalignment mechanism .",
    "on the other hand , the earlier estimate gave @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "since ref .",
    "@xcite did not take into account the efficient annihilation mechanism shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwone ] above @xmath11 , we can take @xmath12 for an illustration as the geometrical mean value of refs . @xcite and @xcite .    on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath0 , there is a severe energy crisis problem . in fig .",
    "[ fig : dwtwo ] , the string - wall system of @xmath13 is shown .",
    "there are walls with strings and walls without strings as shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively .",
    "these small bubbles will collide with the horizon scale string - wall system , but the effect is not erasing the horizon scale wall as shown in ( c ) and ( d ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : dwtwo ] .",
    "another issue related to the pq phase transition after inflation is the feasibility of qcd axion detection @xcite .",
    "our solar system may belong to any value of @xmath14 from 0 to @xmath15 , but the initial misalignment angle @xmath14 has the root mean square value @xmath16 if the pq phase transition occurred after inflation @xcite . for this large @xmath14 ,",
    "the effect of anharmonic term is significant @xcite .",
    "if @xmath17 , we have @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "even if @xmath19 is the most probable value we can expect , any other @xmath14 can not be ruled out for the environment of solar system since the small bubbles of different @xmath14 were possible after inflation .",
    "therefore , it is necessary to look for the entire range of the allowed axion window .    above all ,",
    "the most important irreducible prediction in axion cosmology from this high scale inflation is that the axionic domain wall number should be one . as an example for @xmath7 in the bottom - up approach , typically a ksvz axion @xcite with one heavy quark is suggested .",
    "but , now we are discussing the particle spectrum at the end phase of inflation , around @xmath20 , and hence it is legitimate to bring out all the gut scale spectrum",
    ". the axionic domain wall number may not be just a dfsz model @xcite with @xmath21 or a ksvz model with @xmath7 .",
    "we must add all contributions of the nonvanishing pq charges @xcite .",
    "there is one example of a top - down axion model with all the pq chages of the quarks listed @xcite .",
    "model @xcite . ]    in string models , string axions reside in the antisymmetric tensor field @xmath22 among which @xmath23 is the model - independent ( mi ) axion @xcite and the rest are the model - dependent ( md ) axions @xcite .",
    "both mi and md axions are known to have their decay constants above the gut scale @xcite . in particular , the mi axion has the domain wall number one , which was used in @xcite to obtain @xmath7 from a seemingly huge number of domain walls of order o(100 ) in string compactification . in view of the bicep2 result",

    ", we have fields with the gauge and global charges shown in table [ tab : model ] . to mimic the green - schwarz term @xcite ,",

    "the yukawa couplings respecting the gauge and global u(1 ) symmetries are @xmath31 to mimic the higgs mechanism for the anomalous u(1)@xmath1 via the mi axion in string models , let us assign a vacuum expectation value @xmath32 to @xmath33 , @xmath34 rendering the u(1)@xmath1 gauge boson mass of @xmath35 .",
    "below the scale @xmath36 , we consider the fields @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the yukawa couplings of eq .",
    "( [ eq : yukawa ] ) .",
    "when both a gauge symmetry and a global u(1 ) symmetry are broken by a single vev , then there remains a global symmetry below the new gauge boson mass scale , which is called t hooft mechanism @xcite .",
    "the new global u(1 ) is denoted as u(1)@xmath39 . for the fields we consider ,",
    "the charges @xmath40 are listed in table [ tab : model ] .    the domain wall number calculated below @xmath36 looks like 3 because there are three heavy quark flavors , @xmath41 however , these three vacua are connected by the original anomalous u(1)@xmath1 symmetry , and the physical domain wall number is 1 .",
    "this identification of vacua by the goldstone boson direction can be called the choi - kim ( ck ) mechanism @xcite .",
    "the lazarides - shafi ( ls ) mechanism @xcite where the vacua are identified by the center of nonabelian gauge group is not used here .. in the remainder of the paper , this is always implied .",
    "] another idea breaking the degeneracy explicitly by the instanton effects of another nonabelian group @xcite can not automatically set @xmath42 as the minimum , and we do not consider this possibility .",
    "the ls mechanism needs the invisible axion being housed in some nontrivial representation of the same gauge group @xcite . for our model of table",
    "[ tab : model ] , the singlet @xmath33 does not belong to su(3)@xmath43 and the center of su(3)@xmath43 can not be used for the ls mechanism .",
    "the ck mechanism was noticed more than 25 years ago that if there are two axion directions @xmath44 and @xmath45 , then the common divisor of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is the physically distinguishable domain wall number @xcite .",
    "our mi axion @xmath30 connects the different axion vacua .    .",
    "the dashed brown curve depicts the mountain ridge of the hidden sector axion . ]",
    "the ck idea is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : neqone ] first for @xmath46 and @xmath47 with one confining force in the @xmath45 direction @xcite .",
    "the case with two confining forces will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the @xmath44 torus identifies the vacua with star marks , the vacua with triangle marks and vacua with bullets in the vertical direction .",
    "the @xmath45 torus identifies the vacua with stars in the horizontal direction .",
    "therefore , the star , triangle and bullet vacua are identical , and we interpret it as the seemingly three @xmath45 domain walls are connected by the @xmath46 goldstone boson direction , and hence there is only one physical domain wall .",
    "it is because the largest common divisor of @xmath44 and @xmath45 is 1 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : neqone ] , the axion direction is colored red and the flat valley is colored blue .    the @xmath48 role in the qcd axion has been noted earlier in string compactification models with an anomalous u(1)@xmath1 gauge symmetry @xcite , except which there has not appeared any qcd axion study in string models related to @xmath49 . our pq symmetry is not an approximate one envisioned in refs .",
    "@xcite because the original anomalous u(1)@xmath1 is the string - allowed gauge symmetry .",
    "the resulting pq symmetry is exact except for the anomalies of u(1)@xmath50-su(3)@xmath43-su(3)@xmath43 and u(1)@xmath50-su(2)@xmath51-su(2)@xmath51 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : neqone ] , one can close the blue lines and observe that the vev of the radial field is three times larger than the shift along the one unit solid line .",
    "thus , the scalar vev is the original vacuum degeneracy times larger than @xmath52 .",
    "typically , in string compactification this vacuum degeneracy is expected to be of order 100 . in @xcite ,",
    "the degeneracy is obtained to be 120 .",
    "so , if @xmath53 , the scalar vev can be of order @xmath54 .",
    "in supergravity models , a susy breaking sector is needed .",
    "the most plausible susy breaking sector is another confining force , a hidden sector nonabelian gauge group for which su(@xmath55 ) is assumed here @xcite . to set the vacuum angles at zero ( @xmath42 and @xmath56 ) , then we need two axions whose directions are denoted as @xmath45 ( for su(3)@xmath43 ) and @xmath57 ( for su(@xmath55 ) ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : neqone ] .",
    "the direction of the mi axion is denoted again as @xmath58 .",
    "the anomaly coupling of the mi axion to these nonabelian gauge bosons is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the hidden sector anomaly term and gauge couplings are absorbed in the field strengths .",
    "the mi axion has the same coefficient for the anomaly couplings @xcite .",
    "also , the sum of the anomalous u(1)@xmath1 charges are the same for all gauge groups obtained from the heterotic string @xcite ; thus the qcd axion @xmath61 and the hidden sector axion @xmath62 couple to the respective nonabelian group gauge bosons as @xmath63 where @xmath64 is of order 100 . we can consider three orthogonal axion currents , applicable to the pseudoscalar particles using the pcac relations , @xmath65 note that along the @xmath66 direction , there is no anomaly coupling , viz .",
    "@xmath67 , and the @xmath66 direction is the flat direction shown as the blue valley in fig . [",
    "fig : neqone].@xmath68 it is tantalizing to notice that string compactification with the anomalous u(1)@xmath1 gauge symmetry leads to the qcd axion with @xmath7 .    having",
    "established that the string compactification with the anomalous u(1)@xmath1 gauge symmetry guarantees @xmath7 both for the hidden - sector and the qcd - sector anomalies , we can glimpse the yukawa coupling of the qcd axion and electron .",
    "the dfsz axion coupling to electron is 6 times weaker than @xmath69 because the @xmath21 in the dfsz model , but the qcd axion originating from string along the above scenario is about 100 times weaker than @xmath69 , making it more difficult to probe the existence of axion  electron coupling .",
    "if both the confining scales and the decay constants are widely separated , there exists a cross theorem that the larger confining scale chooses the smaller decay constant @xcite .",
    "since the hidden sector is expected to have the higher anomaly potential , the smallest decay constant corresponds to the hidden sector axion .",
    "the qcd axion potential chooses the next to the smallest decay constant . both of these qcd and hidden - sector axion",
    "decay constants are expected to be at the intermediate scale .",
    "the lowest height chooses the largest decay constant , _",

    "the recent bicep2 result implies that the inflationary phase has ended at @xmath71 which is above the expected qcd axion window : @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "this requires that the axion domain wall number @xmath6 should be one .",
    "we have shown that the mi axion in string compactification with the anomalous u(1)@xmath1 gauge symmetry connects different domains , which realizes a long - sought natural solution ( from a symmetry argument ) for @xmath7 models . even if the final value of the tensor to scalar ratio @xmath3 is reduced by a factor of few , our conclusion requiring @xmath7 is not changed because the fact that the pq phase transition has occurred after inflation would not be changed .",
