    "does the angular momentum vector of an isolated neutron star change orientation as the star spins down ?",
    "early attempts to answer this question focused on the evolution of the angle @xmath10 between the star s rotation and magnetic axes , which can be measured from pulsar polarization swings .",
    "davis & goldstein ( 1970 ) showed that @xmath10 tends towards zero on the braking time - scale if the star is a rigid sphere or a fluid body in hydrostatic equilibrium  an unrealistic scenario which leaves all except the youngest pulsars as aligned rotators , contrary to observation .",
    "goldreich ( 1970 ) observed that the crystalline crust of a neutron star supports shear stresses , thereby preventing a fraction of the hydrostatic bulge from aligning with the instantaneous rotation axis and establishing non - hydrostatic differences between the principal moments of inertia . in the absence of internal friction , such a triaxial star precesses about its principal axis with a period that is short compared to the braking time - scale , and the ( fixed ) angle between the principal axis and magnetic axis determines whether the precession amplitude ( related to @xmath10 ) increases or decreases under the action of the braking torque ( goldreich 1970 ) .    in reality ,",
    "a neutron star is not internally frictionless .",
    "elastic strain energy is dissipated in the crust as the non - hydrostatic deformation discussed above migrates around the star while it precesses ( goldreich 1970 ; chau & henriksen 1971 ; macy 1974 ) .",
    "there is also dissipation due to imperfect coupling between the differentially rotating crust and superfluid core ( shaham 1977 ; alpar & gelman 1987 ; link , epstein & baym 1993 ; sedrakian , wasserman & cordes 1998 ) .",
    "both types of friction damp any precession that is initially present on a time - scale that is , theoretically , much shorter than the precession period  a plausible explanation for why the pulse profiles and polarization characteristics of young pulsars do not change secularly over several years as one expects if the precession is undamped .",
    "the only isolated neutron star unambiguously known to precess is psr b1913@xmath1116 ( weisberg , romani & taylor 1989 ) , where general relativistic effects are responsible .",
    "tentative reports also exist of oscillatory variations in crab and vela timing residuals ( e.g.  lyne , pritchard & smith 1988 ; mcculloch et al .",
    "1990 ; ade , galii & calvani 1997 ) , and some authors have inferred changes in @xmath10 on the braking time - scale from braking - index measurements ( allen & horvath 1997 ; link & epstein 1997 ) and the evolution of pulsar radio beam statistics ( tauris & manchester 1998 ) .    the radiation torque acting on the neutron star has been treated in an incomplete fashion in all of the above work .",
    "the torque has two components : the familiar braking torque , responsible for the secular spin - down of the star , and a component associated with the inertia of the near - zone radiation fields , sometimes misleadingly termed the ` anomalous torque ' ( good & ng 1985 ) , whose effect is to make a spherical star precess about its magnetic axis . in all analyses to date , either the total radiation torque has been set to zero , in order to study free precession ( macy 1974 ; shaham 1977 ; alpar & gelman 1987 ) , or else the near - field component has been neglected , in the belief that it exerts no significant influence on the rotation ( davis & goldstein 1970 ; goldreich 1970 ; chau & henriksen 1971 ; sedrakian et al .",
    "a careful study of both torque components in the context of a spherical star was carried out by good & ng ( 1985 ) for a magnetic dipole , a magnetic quadrupole , and a hypothetical distribution of magnetospheric currents .",
    "casini & montemayor ( 1998 ) recently explored some effects of the near - field torque on a composite body with a spherically symmetric crust coupled to a spherical core ( cf .",
    "de campli 1980 ) .    in this paper , we demonstrate that the near - field component of the radiation torque strongly influences the rotation of an internally frictionless neutron star . in section [ sec : tum2 ] , we derive and solve euler s equations of motion for a rigid , triaxial magnet and show that the regular precession relative to the principal axes of inertia couples to the near - field torque , causing the star to wobble anharmonically . certain potentially observable properties of the wobble are explored in section [ sec : tum3 ] , including its period and amplitude and the slow evolution of @xmath10 and the angular frequency derivative @xmath3 .",
    "the results are applied to pulsar timing and polarization observations , and to the internal structure of young neutron stars , in section [ sec : tum4 ] .",
    "in this section , the rotation of a rigid , triaxial body with an embedded magnetic dipole is treated analytically .",
    "euler s equations of motion are written down in section [ sec : tum2a ] .",
    "two key elements of the motion  the torque - driven radiative precession , and the inertial free precession  are discussed in sections [ sec : tum2b1 ] and [ sec : tum2b2 ] respectively and their time - scales are identified .",
    "euler s equations are then solved approximately in section [ sec : tum2c ] by a time - averaging technique for the special case of a biaxial star .",
    "the similarities and differences between this treatment and previous work are noted in section [ sec : tum2d ] .      consider a rigid , triaxial star with principal axes",

    "we assume that the stellar magnetic field is dipolar and fixed in the star , and we restrict the magnetic axis @xmath21 to lie in the plane spanned by @xmath12 and @xmath14 , at an angle @xmath22 to @xmath14 ; this entails a slight loss of generality .",
    "we also assume that the star is internally frictionless and that it rotates _ in vacuo _ , so that it is unaffected by magnetospheric currents ; refer to goldreich ( 1970 ) and melatos ( 1997 ) for justifications of the latter assumption .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that , although we idealize the star as a rigid body for simplicity , in reality the ellipsoid of inertia is determined by an equilibrium between elastic and hydromagnetic forces , as discussed in section [ sec : tum2b2 ] .    in appendix [ sec : tumappa ] , we evaluate the radiation torque acting on the star from the electromagnetic fields generated by a magnetized , conducting sphere rotating _ in vacuo _ ( deutsch 1955 ; melatos 1997 ) ; it is assumed that the star s triaxiality can be neglected when calculating the fields and torque . upon resolving the torque into components along the principal axes ,",

    "the effect depends only on the radiation fields outside the star , which in turn are determined completely by the magnetic field at the stellar surface and the property that the star is a good conductor ( deutsch 1955 ) .",

    "thus a biaxial star ( @xmath65 ) with @xmath66 and @xmath67 does not precess at all , because the terms @xmath68 and @xmath69 are cancelled out exactly by the near - field torque .      in the absence of the radiation torque ,",

    "if the crust is structured as a coulomb lattice , one has @xmath76 and the non - hydrostatic fraction of the bulge is small ; however , the exact value of @xmath77 is uncertain and may be much less than this upper bound .    the magnetic field inside the star creates an additional deformation because non - radial field gradients ( e.g.  between the poles and equator if the field is a dipole ) support non - radial matter - density gradients in hydromagnetic equilibrium .",
    "( this is not related in any way to the electromagnetic inertia of the external radiation fields discussed in section [ sec : tum2b1 ] . )",
    "the geometry and magnitude of the deformation is difficult to estimate , because little is known about the structure of the internal magnetic field .",
    "thompson & duncan ( 1993 ) argued that , if the internal field is generated after collapse in a convective dynamo , then it must be organized into randomly oriented loops @xmath78 in size , each with field strength @xmath79 ; the neutron star rotates too slowly ( rossby number @xmath80 ) to establish a coherent toroidal field at the base of the convection zone ( cf .  the solar dynamo ) .",
    "on the other hand , if the internal field is generated before collapse in the progenitor star ( e.g.  in the convective outer envelope or hydrogen - burning core ) , a large toroidal field can grow ( @xmath81 ) .",
    "blandford , applegate & hernquist ( 1983 ) examined toroidal field generation by a thermoelectric dynamo .",
    "several authors have raised the possibility of a very strong internal field ( @xmath82 ) in diverse contexts , including off - centred - dipole theories of the pulsar death line ( arons 1998 ) , thermally regulated resurrection of a buried field ( muslimov & page 1996 ) , ohmic decay in an anisotropically conducting core ( haensel , urpin & yakovlev 1990 ) , crust - core coupling in vela glitches ( abney , epstein & olinto 1996 ; cf .",

    "assuming that the internal magnetic field is at least as strong as the surface field and roughly dipolar , we find that the hydromagnetic deformation satisfies @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the isothermal sound speed ( @xmath86 in a relativistic star ) ; in other words , @xmath87 exceeds @xmath88 at least by a factor of order the ratio of the stellar to schwarzschild radii .",
    "this yields an upper bound on the precession period @xmath89 associated with the hydromagnetic deformation given by @xmath90 note that the combined elasto - hydromagnetic deformation is triaxial in general .",
    "biaxiality ( @xmath91 ) is a good approximation only when one has @xmath92 ( or else @xmath93 ) and the internal magnetic field ( or crust ) is symmetric about a unique axis .",
    "equations ( [ eq : tum17a ] ) , ( [ eq : tum17c ] ) and ( [ eq : tum10 ] ) reveal that , as a rule , _ the periods of the radiative precession and free precession are comparable_. one has @xmath94 , if the internal and surface magnetic fields are of similar magnitude , and sometimes @xmath95 as well , e.g.  for a one - second pulsar with @xmath96 and @xmath97 . in general , therefore , the ` free ' precession is not free at all ; rather , it couples to the near - field component of the radiation torque , and its character is modified significantly as a result .",
    "this coupling has been overlooked in the literature on aspherical rotators to date ( goldreich 1970 ; chau & henriksen 1971 ; macy 1974 ; shaham 1977 ; alpar & gelman 1987 ; sedrakian et al .",
    "1998 ) , and the remainder of this paper is devoted to exploring its consequences .",

    "euler s equations ( [ eq : tum2 ] ) to ( [ eq : tum4 ] ) can be solved approximately by averaging over the precession period , exploiting the fact that both @xmath0 and @xmath99 are small compared to @xmath2 ( except in the regime @xmath100 ; see section [ sec : tum3f ] ) .",
    "the analysis parallels that by goldreich ( 1970 ) , with one crucial difference : we account fully for the radiative precession in what follows , whereas goldreich ( 1970 ) artificially suppressed it by averaging the braking torque _ and near - field torque _ over the free precession period .",

    "instead , they bend downwards to merge with the diagonal , travelling down along it as @xmath164 decreases .",
    "this is because the state @xmath181 is only a fixed point for @xmath111 , as pointed out above .",

    "as shown in figure [ fig : tum4 ] , @xmath106 and @xmath107 interchange oscillation modes at @xmath186 , swapping between a wine - glass mode and a sinusoidal mode , while the @xmath108 oscillation becomes temporarily flatter - peaked .",

    "the dotted curve in figure [ fig : tum5 ] shows that pseudo - glitches coincide with rapid changes in @xmath10 , accompanied by mode jumping , which occur when the free precession is modulated on a fast time - scale @xmath195 which couples resonantly to the radiative precession ( i.e.  @xmath196 ) .",
    "it turns out that the sharpness of the spikes is sensitive to @xmath64 and @xmath197 ; for the example in figure [ fig : tum5 ] , the spikes are washed out once @xmath64 falls outside the range @xmath198 .",

    "the foregoing results pertain to the regime @xmath38 , where @xmath20 is taken to be the stellar radius @xmath37 .",

    "the radiative precession period satisfies @xmath205 , the near - field radiation torque uncouples from the free precession , and the evolution of the precession amplitude is governed completely by @xmath206 ( goldreich 1970 ) .",
    "however , a pulsar born with @xmath204 soon evolves towards the regime @xmath38 as @xmath207 decreases . therefore ,",
    "unless the free precession amplitude decreases to zero during the initial braking phase with @xmath204 ( _ not _ the outcome in general ) , the rotation behaves thereafter in the way described in sections [ sec : tum3a ] to [ sec : tum3e ] .",
    "timing and polarization studies suggest that most , if not all , young pulsars do not precess in the manner described in sections [ sec : tum2 ] and [ sec : tum3 ] .",
    "the implication is that isolated neutron stars born with a large precessional motion approach stable spin states ( @xmath53 parallel to a principal axis of inertia ) over times that are short compared to their current ages , probably due to internal friction .",
    "we outline the conditions for a neutron star to be born with a large precessional motion in section [ sec : tum4a1 ] , summarize the status of observational searches for precession in section [ sec : tum4a ] , and discuss the observational consequences of frictional stabilization in section [ sec : tum4b ] .",
    "when a neutron star is born , it spins about an axis @xmath208 dictated by conservation of angular momentum ( of the degenerate remnant and the ejecta ) during the supernova explosion .",
    "there is no reason why @xmath208 should immediately be parallel to the principal axis of greatest non - hydrostatic moment of inertia ( the magnetic axis @xmath21 , since the star is a fluid ) .",
    "indeed , thompson & duncan ( 1993 ) argued that post - collapse convection destroys any correlation between @xmath208 and @xmath21 .",
    "viscous dissipation in the fluid star forces @xmath208 to approach @xmath21 over time .",
    "the dissipation rate is therefore critical in determining whether the star will exhibit a large initial precession when its crust crystallizes .",
    "unfortunately , the viscosity of a newly born neutron star is poorly constrained .",
    "cutler & lindblom ( 1987 ) estimate the viscous damping time ( e.g.  for stellar oscillations ) to be roughly @xmath209 , to be compared with a crust crystallization time of less than one year , but this estimate is known to be valid only in narrow ranges of density @xmath210 and temperature @xmath211 centred on the above fiducial values . in what follows , we make no assumption about the viscous damping time and instead explore several possible scenarios .",
    "if the viscosity is high enough , @xmath208 aligns with @xmath21 first , before the crust crystallizes . assuming that the symmetry axis of the crust when it crystallizes is along @xmath208 ( likely , though not certain ) , then the principal axis @xmath14 ( from both elastic and magnetic contributions ) is parallel to @xmath208 , and there is no precession .",
    "if the viscosity is low enough , the crust crystallizes first , before @xmath208 has time to align with @xmath21  the order of events implied by the viscosity estimates of cutler & lindblom ( 1987 ) . in this scenario",
    ", two things can happen : ( i ) one has @xmath93 , and the symmetry axis of the crust when it crystallizes is along @xmath208 , so that @xmath14 is parallel to @xmath208 and there is no precession ; or ( ii ) one has @xmath92 , so that @xmath14 is parallel to @xmath21  which is _ not _ parallel to @xmath208 at the epoch of crystallization  and there is a large precession .",
    "below we explore the observational implications of scenario ( ii ) .",
    "the results of section [ sec : tum3 ] imply that a neutron star in an arbitrary initial spin state precesses ( and nutates ) with period @xmath212 and a typical amplitude of tens of degrees , and that the motion is persistent in general .",
    "one therefore expects fractional changes of order unity in the pulse profile ( e.g.  relative height or separation of conal components ) , magnetic inclination angle @xmath10 ( measured from polarization - swing data ) , and angular frequency derivative @xmath3 ( measured by timing ) over a single precession period . for young , crab - like objects ( @xmath213 , @xmath214 ) , the fractional changes amount to @xmath215 per cent per year and ought to be readily observable ; for old objects ( @xmath216 , @xmath217 ) , the changes amount to @xmath218 per cent per year and are harder to detect .",
    "contrary to the above expectation , the only reliable detection of neutron - star precession to date has been weisberg et al.s ( 1989 ) discovery of the general relativistic geodetic precession of psr 1913@xmath1116 .",
    "six years of accurate measurements of the doubly - peaked radio pulse profile revealed that the flux density in the first component is decreasing relative to the second by @xmath219 per cent per year , consistent with the line of sight moving across a spot of enhanced emissivity in the magnetosphere at the rate prescribed by geodetic precession .",
    "weisberg et al.s ( 1989 ) upper limit @xmath220 on the six - year change in pulse width @xmath221 implies a maximum precession amplitude @xmath222 , consistent with a relativistic origin and much larger than the predicted radiative precession amplitude of @xmath223 .",
    "hence psr b1913@xmath1116 does not usefully constrain the amplitude of radiative precession in old pulsars .",
    "no unambiguous instances of non - relativistic precession are known .",
    "lyne et al .  ( 1988 ) reported a quasi - sinusoidal variation with a period of @xmath224 months in the phase residuals of six years of crab timing data , and a similar feature was claimed to exist in vela ( mcculloch et al .",

    "the quasi - periodic nature of the vela glitches ( lyne et al .",

    "it has been claimed that changes in @xmath10 on a time - scale of @xmath227 explain the braking indices of the crab and vela , and sudden jumps in @xmath10 explain the persistent increase in @xmath3 following a glitch ( allen & horvath 1997 ; link & epstein 1997 ) , but the relevant time - scales are too long and too short , respectively , to be precession - related .",
    "tauris & manchester ( 1997 ) used polarization - swing data for more than 100 pulsars to construct the @xmath10 distribution of the pulsar population , corrected for decreasing beam radius with age .",
    "the corrected distribution is skewed towards small @xmath10 , with @xmath228 decreasing on a time - scale of @xmath229  once again , too gradual to be a precession - related effect .",
    "the observational evidence against substantial changes in pulse profiles and polarization properties implies that any precession initially present is damped rapidly .",
    "consequently , direct detection of a precessing , isolated pulsar may only be possible in the immediate aftermath of a galactic supernova . if the precession amplitude is sufficiently large , the newly born pulsar will shine intermittently , as its emission cone drifts into and out of the line of sight , as well as exhibit the profile and polarization changes discussed above .",
    "frictional damping inside a neutron star proceeds rapidly in theory .",
    "several authors have estimated the dissipation times due to time - dependent elastic strain ( chau & henriksen 1971 ; macy 1974 ) and imperfect core - crust coupling ( shaham 1977 ; de campli 1980 ; alpar & gelman 1987 ; link et al .",

    "we are not concerned with the precise origin of the friction in a neutron star ; we simply suppose it exists and examine the fate of the dissipated energy .",
    "initially , when the star is precessing , its angular momentum and energy are given by @xmath232^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath233 .",
    "after the precession has been damped , the final angular momentum and energy are given by @xmath234 and @xmath235 ( @xmath236 by analogy with the earth ) .",
    "if the damping occurs over a time @xmath6 that is short compared to @xmath2 and @xmath0 , we have @xmath237 and hence @xmath238 for @xmath239 ( section [ sec : tum3 ] ) , the total dissipated energy is of order @xmath240 .",
    "we now suppose that the dissipation is localized in the inner and outer crusts , where the ions are organized into a lattice and the shear modulus is non - zero , and we estimate the resulting increase in the star s thermal luminosity @xmath241 .",
    "the thermal conduction time in the crust , @xmath8 , is not known with certainty ( nomoto & tsuruta 1987 ) , so we appeal to the extreme cases of slow cooling ( @xmath242 ) and fast cooling ( @xmath243 ) to place bounds on @xmath241 . in the regime @xmath242 , the dissipated energy @xmath244",

    "taking @xmath249 , we find that the final temperature of an iron crust of mass @xmath250 is @xmath251 , and its thermal luminosity is @xmath252 . in the opposite regime @xmath243 , the dissipated heat is conducted rapidly through the crust and one has @xmath253 ( cf .",

    "the duration of the thermal source is the maximum of @xmath6 and @xmath8 , starting from the time when the star first crystallizes into a body with a rigid crust spinning down electromagnetically .",

    "the ` free ' precession is not truly free , a fact that has been overlooked in the literature to date .    in the regime @xmath157 ,",
    "the star rotates in a distinctive way : ( i ) it precesses and nutates anharmonically , typically with an amplitude of tens of degrees ( section [ sec : tum3b ] ) ; ( ii ) the magnetic inclination angle @xmath10 swings through tens of degrees during one precession period ( section [ sec : tum3c ] ) ; ( iii ) the precession can persist or decay to zero ( i.e.steady rotation ) depending on the parameters @xmath105 and @xmath22 and the initial orientation of @xmath53 ( section [ sec : tum3d ] ) ; and ( iv ) the frequency derivative @xmath258 oscillates about its overall spin - down trend , exhibiting spiky , glitch - like behaviour for triaxial stars with @xmath196 ( section [ sec : tum3e ] ) .",
    "the precession and nutation lead to fractional changes of order unity in the pulse profile , polarization swing and @xmath3 of an isolated pulsar on a time - scale @xmath259 , with @xmath260 for young , crab - like objects and @xmath261 for old pulsars . such changes are not observed .",
