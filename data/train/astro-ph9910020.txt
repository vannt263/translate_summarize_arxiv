    "bulges of spiral galaxies are cornerstones for constraining theories of galaxy formation . located at the centers of spiral galaxies , they hold the signature of the sequence of formation outside - in or inside - out of the different sub - systems building a spiral galaxy :  halo , disc , and bulge . the prominence of bulges varies widely along the hubble sequence .",
    "this contrasts with the situation for spiral disks whose mass is nearly constant among all types of spirals @xcite .",
    "hence , bulges constitute a main key to our understanding of spiral galaxy evolution . to set the context for our project",
    ", we describe below the two currently most popular scenarios on bulge formation that have been proposed over the years .",
    "* monolithic dissipative collapse : * bulges form before disks do , on very short time scales . as the pregalactic gas collapses and forms stars , metals are ejected by winds blown by massive stars and supernovae .",
    "if the galaxy potential well is deep enough to retain these ejecta , the enriched gas is carried inward to the galaxy center . as new stars are formed , their chemical composition reflects that of the gas . the result is a radial metallicity gradient ,",
    "whose amplitude should increase with galaxy mass and luminosity ( carlberg , @xcite ; arimoto & yoshii , @xcite ) .",
    "evidence in favor of this scenario has been presented by means of spectroscopic studies of _ ellipticals _ : reported the presence of a correlation between radial mg@xmath1 absorption - line - strength gradients and galaxy mass , velocity dispersion , and central line strength for low to intermediate - mass ( _ i.e. _ , @xmath2 ) ellipticals , as opposed to _ giant _",
    "ellipticals ( but see different results by gonzlez & gorgas @xcite and kobayashi & arimoto @xcite ) . the gradients may thus be driven mostly by dissipation in smallish ellipticals , whereas merging and violent relaxation play a more important role for giant ellipticals .",
    "what about the actual case of bulges of spirals",
    "? there is strong evidence that bulges are analogous to low to intermediate - mass ellipticals in several _ global _ principal properties : they populate the same location in the fundamental plane @xcite ; they form a continuous sequence in the @xmath3 vs.  ellipticity diagram ( being supported by rotation , bender et al .",
    "@xcite ) . as to the stellar populations , performed a spectroscopic pilot study of the centers of bulges of face - on spirals .",
    "they revealed the existence of striking similarities between bulges and ellipticals .",
    "_ e.g. _ , their luminosity - metallicity relations , when derived from @xmath0-elements ( such as the mg@xmath1 index ) , are consistent with one another .",
    "* secular evolution :  * bulges form from disc material through redistribution of angular momentum . in this scenario ,",
    "large amounts of gas are driven into the central region of the galaxy by a stellar bar and trigger intense star formation ( _ e.g. _ , pfenniger & norman @xcite ) .",
    "if enough mass is accreted , the bar itself will be dissolved and the resulting galaxy will reveal a bigger bulge than before bar formation ; galaxies would thus evolve from late to earlier types along the hubble sequence .",
    "this model also certainly has its attractions .",
    "bars appear in at least @xmath42/3 of disk galaxies @xcite , and several numerical simulations have indicated that bars can significantly influence the dynamical evolution of galaxies , through mechanisms such as disk thickening by box - peanut or bending instabilities ( combes et al . ,",
    "@xcite ) or radial mass inflow towards the center @xcite . since bars appear to be able to affect the global dynamics of galaxies , it is natural to suspect that bars can be responsible for significant chemical evolution as well , due to mixing by the bar - induced kinematics .",
    "recent n - body simulations ( that include the effect of star formation ) have shown this to be a valid suspicion in the sense that any initial abundance gradient is indeed significantly washed out @xmath41 gyr after formation of a bar , both for gas and stars (; ) .",
    "the slope of the abundance gradient is found to flatten beyond the co - rotation radius , by up to @xmath450%  through the effect of one ( strong ) bar .",
    "observational evidence for this effect exists , albeit only for the gas component so far .",
    "several groups have shown that global radial gradients of the gas metallicity ( in terms of [ o / h ] in hii regions ) in barred spirals are shallower than gradients in `` normal '' spirals of the same hubble type ( vila - costas & edmunds , @xcite ; zaritsky et al . , @xcite ; martin & roy , @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , a clear relation seems to exist between the relative length of the bar with respect to the size of the ( optical ) disk and the slope of the radial [ o / h ] gradient among barred spirals @xcite in the sense that the larger the bar / disk ratio , the shallower the abundance gradient .    1.1 .",
    "line - strength gradients : key to the controversy ?",
    "it thus seems that radial population gradients in bulges have great potential in discriminating between the main bulge formation scenarios .",
    "previous work on stellar populations in bulges has mainly been limited to photometric studies : balcells & peletier ( @xcite ) in ubri , and terndrup et al .   in j and k ,",
    "show that for luminous bulges , color gradients become increasingly negative with increasing luminosity ( similar to the case among ellipticals ) . however , many faint bulges deviate from this trend and keep showing strong negative color gradients , and the two studies mentioned above do not converge in their conclusions . besides , it is now well known that broad - band photometry is incapable of accurately disentangling the effects of age , metallicity , and dust absorption , whereas stellar line strenghts are dust - independent and _ can _ separate the effects of age and metallicity ( _ e.g. _ , worthey , @xcite , hereafter w94 ; vazdekis",
    "@xcite ) . with this in mind",
    ", we embarked on a spectroscopic survey of a significant sample of bulges to compare their possible star formation histories with those in ellipticals .",
    "in order to avoid contamination from disk light , we selected a sample of 28 edge - on , nearby spiral galaxies from the ugc and eso - lv catalogs , and oriented the spectrograph slit along the minor axis of the bulges .",
    "the sample encompasses a considerable range in luminosities for each hubble type ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the observations ( spectroscopy and two - color imaging ) of the northern spirals were obtained with the 2.5-m isaac newton telescope at la palma , while the southern spirals were observed with the eso ntt and 3.6-m telescopes . as to the spectroscopy , the typical exposure time was @xmath44 hours per galaxy , and the instrumental resolution was typically of order 100 km s@xmath6 .",
    "the spectral range used ( typically 39005500 ) allowed the measurement of most lick / ids line - strength indices .",
    "all spectral data reduction and line index measurements were performed using the r@xmath7d@xmath8e package which propagates errors associated with all reduction steps along with the science data .",
    "the line indices were fully calibrated to the lick / ids system ( including broadening corrections ) , using measurements of @xmath440 ids standard stars @xcite .",
    "full details of the sample selection , the observations , and the calibrations will be provided in a forthcoming paper .",
    "at the time this paper is written , data analysis of 16 bulges in our sample is completed . here",
    "we describe some highlights of the results from this subsample .    3.1 .",
    "central line strengths    in order to effectively compare `` central '' line strengths for bulges with those of ellipticals in the literature , we extracted spectra with spatial extent 4@xmath9 from the galaxy center _ but avoiding the innermost dust lane _ to eliminate disk light . in disentangling the effects of age and metallicity ,",
    "most authors have used a combination of h@xmath10 and `` metallic '' line - strengths such as mg@xmath1 , mg@xmath11 , fe5270 and fe5335 ( _ e.g. _ , gonzlez 1993 ) . however , the use of the h@xmath10 and mg@xmath11 indices is very limited in case nebular emission is present @xcite , which is `` unfortunately '' often the case in our spectra .",
    "we did not attempt to correct h@xmath10 for emission , but rather used the h@xmath12 index as age - sensitive index ( calibrated in age / metallicity space by worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) .",
    "since the relative strength of balmer line emission decreases rapidly with balmer order ( _ e.g. _ , osterbrock 1974 ) , h@xmath12 is significantly less diluted by nebular emission than h@xmath10 is .    in fig .",
    "[ f : metals_hga ] we present plots of the h@xmath12 index vs.two metallicity indicators :  _ ( i ) _",
    "c@xmath14668 which jones & worthey ( @xcite ) identified as a particularly metallicity - sensitive index , and _",
    "@xmath13 = ( fe5270+fe5335)/2 . for comparison , we also plot the results of kuntschner & davies ( @xcite ; hereafter kd98 ) for the centers of e and s0 galaxies in the fornax cluster , as well as predictions from single - burst population synthesis models ( w94 ; worthey & ottaviani 1997 ) .",
    "it turns out that the bulges in our sample have ages similar to ( or up to a few gyr `` younger '' than ) those of _ cluster",
    "_ ellipticals . on the other hand , luminosity - weighted ages of a sample biased towards _ field",
    "_ ellipticals ( gonzlez 1993 ) span the whole range found for bulges .",
    "the metallicities of bulges cover a range similar to those of ellipticals .",
    "interestingly , bulges of later - type ( sb  sc ) spirals are , in the mean , less metal rich than their counterparts in earlier - types .",
    "this seems to be a bulge luminosity effect , judging from the symbol sizes in fig.[f : metals_hga ] .",
    "there are no other obvious distinctions between bulges of different hubble types in this context .",
    "another interesting point is that , comparing the positions of the galaxies in figs .",
    "[ f : metals_hga]a and [ f : metals_hga]b , it appears that c@xmath1 ( _ i.e. _ , the c@xmath14668 index ) is overabundant in ellipticals and bulges with respect to solar abundance ratios .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ f : alpha_fe]a which compares c@xmath14668 with @xmath13 . comparing the observations with the superimposed models of w94 ,",
    "it is obvious that c@xmath14668 is stronger than indicated by the models ( which employed solar abundance ratios ) . whether this is a real overabundance effect ( or , _",
    "e.g. _ , due to a problem in the fitting functions ) is an issue which deserves further analysis .",
    "radial line - strength gradients    fig .",
    "[ f : alpha_fe]b shows a @xmath13 vs.  mg@xmath1 plot for the bulges in our sample .",
    "the symbols depict the `` central '' values , while the arrows point towards the outermost well - measured values ; the length of the arrows is a measure of the slope of the gradient .",
    "it is clear that , in most bulges , mg is overabundant with respect to solar abundance ratios .",
    "the [ mg / fe ] abundance ratio in bulges is similar to those found in ellipticals , and stays more or less constant throughout the radial extent of bulges . from the ( overplotted ) @xmath0-element - overabundance models by for [ mg / fe ]",
    "= 0.45 and an age of 12 gyr ( and mixing length parameter @xmath14=1.5 ) , we estimate that [ mg / fe ] @xmath15 0.4 .",
    "+ is there a correlation between the metallicity gradient and luminosity for bulges , as predicted by dissipative collapse models ?",
    "this relation is depicted in fig .",
    "[ f : mv_vs_grad ] .",
    "bulge luminosities = 50 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ] were derived by performing ellipse fits to the isophotes of the galaxy images , after masking out wedges encompassing the dusty disks ( @xmath17 20@xmath18 from the major axes ) .",
    "the gradient - luminosity correlation indeed exists ; any further distinction between bulges of different hubble types within this relation is not obvious .",
    "incidentally , the mg@xmath1 gradients of the most luminous bulges as well as the slope of the gradient - luminosity relation are similar to those among low - luminosity ellipticals in the carollo et al .",

    "from the spectral data of bulges of spirals in our sample analyzed so far , we have established the following main results : + [ -4ex ]    1 .",

    "many bulges are as old as cluster ellipticals , but some ( low - luminosity ) bulges have luminosity - weighted ages up to a few gyr younger ( note that this result may be influenced by residual light from thick disks ) . +",
    "[ -4.2ex ] 2 .",
    "bulges are typically overabundant in @xmath0-elements , up to [ mg / fe ] @xmath23 + 0.4 dex , throughout their radial extent .",
    "there is no obvious correlation between [ mg / fe ] and bulge luminosity .",
    "this is similar to the situation among ellipticals , and indicates that the bulk of the stars in bulges typically formed within a few gyr ( before the onset of snia explosions ; _",
    "e.g. _ , worthey , faber & gonzlez @xcite ) . + [ -4.2ex ] 3 .",
    "there is a correlation between the radial metal - line index gradients and the bulge luminosities for bulges in our sample .",

    "sect .  1 ) .",
    "however , some individual bulges seem to be younger than the rest and show shallow radial mg@xmath1 gradients , which in turn can be due to effects induced by bar instabilities .",
