    "is fixed and is aligned with the @xmath8-axis of a cartesian coordinate system .",
    "the method presented here is extended in some forthcoming works to more general anisotropies @xcite .",
    "anisotropic problems are common in mathematical modeling and numerical simulation .",
    "indeed they occur in several fields of applications such as flows in porous media  @xcite , semiconductor modelling @xcite , quasi - neutral plasma simulations @xcite , image processing @xcite , atmospheric or oceanic flows @xcite , and so on , the list being not exhaustive .",
    "more specifically high anisotropy aligned with one direction may occur in shell problems or simulation in stretched media .",
    "the initial motivation for the present work is closely related to magnetized plasma simulations such as atmospheric @xcite or inertial fusion plasmas @xcite or plasma thrusters @xcite . in this context",
    ", the medium is structured by the magnetic field .",
    "indeed , the motion of charged particles in planes perpendicular to the magnetic field is governed by a fast gyration around the magnetic field lines .",
    "this explains the large number of collisions the particles encounter in the perpendicular plane , whereas the dynamic in the parallel direction is rather undisturbed . as a consequence",
    "the particle mobilities in the perpendicular and parallel directions differ by many orders of magnitude . in the context of ionospheric plasma modelling @xcite ,",
    "the ratio of the aligned and transverse mobilities ( denoted in this paper by @xmath9 ) can be as huge as ten to the power ten .",
    "the relevant boundary conditions in many fields of application are periodic ( for instance in simulations of tokamak plasmas on a torus ) or neumann boundary conditions ( see for instance @xcite for atmospheric plasmas ) .",
    "the system is thus a good model to elaborate a robust numerical method .",
    "+ the main difficulties with the resolution of problem ( [ aniso ] ) are of numerical nature , as solving this singular perturbation problem for small @xmath10 is rather delicate .",
    "indeed , replacing in the anisotropic elliptic equation @xmath11 by zero , yields an ill - posed problem , which has an infinite number of solutions ( namely all functions which are constant in the @xmath8-direction ) .",
    "this feature is translated in the discrete case ( after the discretization of the problem ) into a linear system which is very ill - conditioned for @xmath12 , due to the different order of magnitudes of the various terms . as a consequence",
    "standard numerical methods for the resolution of linear systems lead to important numerical costs and unacceptable numerical errors .",
    "more generally , this numerical difficulty arises when the boundary conditions supplied to the dominant @xmath13 operator lead to an ill - posed problem with a multiplicity of solutions .",
    "this is the case for neumann boundary conditions , but also of periodic boundary conditions .",
    "if instead , the boundary conditions are such that the dominant operator gives a well - posed problem with a unique solution , this difficulty vanishes as the leading operator alone will suffice to completely determine the limit solution . in this case , one can resort to standard methods .",
    "this is the case of dirichlet or robin boundary conditions . in spite of",
    "the fact that the problem addressed in the present paper arises only with specific boundary conditions , it has a considerable impact in many physics problem , such as plasmas , geophysical flows , plate and shells , etc . in this paper",
    ", we will focus on neumann boundary conditions because they represent a larger range of physical applications , but we could address periodic boundary conditions in a similar way .",
    "numerical methods for anisotropic elliptic problems have been extensively investigated in the literature .",
    "depending on the underlying physics , distinct numerical methods are developed .",
    "for example domain decomposition ( schur complement ) and multigrid techniques , using multiple coarse grid corrections are adapted to anisotropic equations in @xcite and @xcite . for anisotropy aligned with one ( or two directions ) ,",
    "point ( or plane ) smoothers are shown to be very efficient @xcite .",
    "a problem very similar to is addressed in @xcite , treated via a parametrisation technique , and seems to give good results for rather large anisotropy ratios .",
    "however , these techniques are only developed in the context of an elliptic operator with a dominant part supplemented with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "+ an alternative approach for dealing with highly anisotropic problems is based on a mathematical reformulation of the continuous problem , in order to obtain a more harmless problem , which can be solved numerically in an uncomplicated manner . in this category",
    "can be situated for example asymptotic models , describing for small values of the asymptotic parameter @xmath14 the evolution of an approximation @xmath15 of the solution of ( [ aniso ] ) @xcite .",
    "however , these asymptotic models are precise only for @xmath16 , and can not be used on the whole range of values covered by the physical parameter @xmath14 .",
    "thus model coupling methods have to be employed . in sub - domains where the limit model is no longer valid",
    ", the original model has to be used , which means that a model coupling strategy has to be developed .",
    "however the coupling strategy requires the existence of an area where both models are valid and still demands an accurate numerical method for the resolution of the original model ( i.e. the anisotropic elliptic problem ) with large anisotropies",
    ". this can be rather undesirable .",
    "+ in this paper , we present an original numerical algorithm belonging to the second approach .",
    "a reformulation of the continuous problem ( [ aniso ] ) will permit us to solve this problem in an inexpensive way and accurately enough , independently of the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this scheme is related to the _ asymptotic preserving _ numerical method introduced in @xcite .",
    "these techniques are designed to provide computations in various regimes without any restriction on the discretization meshes and with the additional property to converge towards the solution of the limit problem when the asymptotic parameter goes to zero .",
    "the derivation of such asymptotic preserving methods requires first the identification of the limit model . for singular perturbation problems ,",
    "a reformulation of the problem is required in order to derive a set of equations containing both the initial and the limit model with a continuous transition from one regime to another , according to the values of the parameter @xmath14 .",
    "this reformulated system of equations sets the foundation of the ap - scheme .",
    "other singular perturbations have already been explored in previous studies , for instance quasi - neutral or gyro - fluid limits @xcite .",
    "these techniques have been first introduced for non - stationary systems of equations , for which the time discretization must be studied with care in order to guarantee the asymptotic preserving property . for the anisotropic elliptic equation investigated in this article ,",
    "we only need to precise the reformulated system and provide a discretization of this one .",
    "+ the outline of this paper is the following .",
    "section  [ sec2 ] of this article presents first the initial anisotropic elliptic model . in the remainder of this paper",
    ", it will be referred to as the singular-_perturbation _ model ( p - model ) . the reformulated system ( referred to as the _ asymptotic preserving _ formulation or ap - formulation )",
    "is then derived .",
    "it relates on a decomposition of the solution @xmath17 according to its _ mean part _",
    "@xmath18 along the @xmath8 coordinate and a _ fluctuation _ @xmath19 consisting of a correction to the mean part needed to recover the full solution .",
    "the mean part @xmath20 is solution of an @xmath11-independent elliptic problem , and the fluctuation @xmath21 is given by a well - posed @xmath11-dependent elliptic problem .",
    "the advantage is that the @xmath11-dependent problem for the fluctuation is well - posed and solvable in an inexpensive way , and this uniformly in @xmath14 . in the limit @xmath22",
    "the ap - formulation reduces to the so called _ limit _ model ( @xmath23-model ) , whose solution is an acceptable approximation of the p - model solution for @xmath12 .",
    "the present derivation is carried out in the framework of an anisotropy aligned along one axis of a cartesian coordinate system . in the context of magnetized plasma simulations ,",
    "this initial work is extended in a forthcoming work for the three dimensional case in curvilinear coordinates , designed to fit a more complex magnetic field topology ( i.e. anisotropy direction ) @xcite .",
    "the main constraints of this method reside in the construction of the mean part which necessitates the integration of the solution along the anisotropy direction .",
    "this operation is easily carried out in the context of coordinates adapted with the anisotropy direction .",
    "however , an extension of the techniques presented here is currently developed for non - adapted coordinates @xcite .",
    "+ section [ sec3 ] is devoted to the numerical implementation of the ap - formulation .",
    "numerical results are then presented for a test case , and the three approaches ( ap - formulation , straight discretization and resolution of the p - model and l - model ) are compared according to the precision of the approximation for different values of @xmath11 . in section [ sec4 ]",
    "we shall rigorously analyse the convergence of the ap - scheme .",
    "error estimates will be established which underline the advantages of the ap - scheme as compared to the initial singular perturbation model and the limit model .",
    "current research directions are concerned with the adaptation of the present technique to the case of arbitrary spatially varying anisotropies , without adaptation of the coordinate system to the direction of the anisotropy .",
    "these developments will allow the treatment on nonlinear problems , when the diffusion tensor ( and its principal directions ) depend on the solution itself .",
    "this treatment will involve iterative methods which , at each iterate , will reduce the problem to the solution of a linear anisotropic diffusion problem .",
    "for simplicity we shall consider in this paper the two - dimensional problem , posed on a rectangular domain @xmath24 , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are intervals .",
    "the ideas exposed here can be extended without any problems to the more physical three - dimensional domain , with two transverse directions @xmath27 and an anisotropy direction aligned with the @xmath8-direction . in this section",
    "we introduce the singular perturbation model , the limit model and the asymptotic preserving formulation .",

    "gives rise to the l - model  , verified by the solution of the singular perturbation model in the limit @xmath22 .",
    "the l - model is the singular limit of the original p - model  .",

    "this implies that the discretization matrix derived from the p - model is very ill - conditioned for small @xmath43 .",
    "this point is addressed by the numerical experiments of section  [ sec33 ] .",
    "consequently , in a domain where @xmath11 varies significantly , a model coupling method has to be developed in order to exploit the validity of each model , the p- and l - model",
    ". this can be rather undesirable . in the next section we shall present an alternative approach , which is based on a reformulation of the singular - perturbation model providing a means of computing an accurate numerical approximation of the solution for all values @xmath7 .",

    "any standard numerical solution of the p - model will converge to that of the r - model .",
    "in other words , with dirichlet boundary conditions , the perturbation becomes regular and the limit solution is fully determined by the formal limit system .",
