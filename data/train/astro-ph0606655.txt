    "blazars , consisting of bl lac objects and flat - spectrum radio quasars , are a subclass of agns whose relativistic jet is nearly aligned to the line of sight , and show extreme variabilities at from radio through optical and x - ray to high - energy @xmath4-ray wavelengths @xcite .",
    "long term multi - wavelength monitorings show that the variabilities of blazars are very complex with large amplitude and on time - scale ranging from tens of minutes , hours and days to months and years at all wavelengths .",
    "the outbursts with time - scale of order of years or longer in some blazars are periodic @xcite and of particular interest as it might connect to the presence of supermassive black hole binary ( smbhb ) at center @xcite , whose ultimate coalescence would generate an outburst of gravitational wave radiation @xcite and be the main target of a future space gravitational wave detector , laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) @xcite .",
    "smbhbs in galactic nuclei are expected by the hierarchical galaxy formation model in the cold dark matter ( cdm ) cosmology @xcite in which the present galaxies are the products of frequent galaxy minor mergers .",
    "active smbhb and final coalescence have been suggested to be the physical origin of the peculiar radio morphologies in some agns ( for a recent review , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , e.g. the helical morphology of radio jets @xcite , the interruption and recurrence of activity in double - double radio galaxies @xcite , the x - shaped feature of winged radio sources @xcite , the orbital motion of radio core ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "since they were discovered in bl lac object oj287 @xcite , periodic optical outbursts of blazars have been ascribed to the orbital motion of smbhb @xcite . however , it is unclear how smbhbs in agns trigger the observed periodic outbursts if present .",
    "the proposed scenarios in literature include ( 1 ) direct impact of the secondary black hole against a standard thin accretion disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ) or an inefficient accretion flow , e.g. advection dominated accretion flow ( adaf ; * ? ? ? * ) , ( 2 ) rotating helical jets due to the orbital motion of smbhb @xcite , ( 3 ) periodic change of jet orientation introduced by the lens - thirring precessing of a warped disk @xcite .",
    "although the detailed physical mechanisms in these models are different , all of them suggest a common feature of single period in the light curves",
    ".    one more complication to the investigation of the periodicity in blazars is from the observations of low frequency x - ray quasi - periodic oscillations ( qpos ) in black hole x - ray binaries @xcite and possibly in sgr a@xmath5 of our galactic center @xcite , which are believed to be due to the disk oscillations .",
    "black hole x - ray binaries , so called micro - quasars , are physical analogue to agns and are powered by accretion of stellar black holes of mass about @xmath6 . as the variation time - scale of accretion disk around black holes is proportional to the mass of black hole and the formation of jet",
    "is coupled with accretion disk @xcite , the low frequency qpo with typical frequency @xmath7 in micro - quasars corresponds to a period of order of years or longer in a blazar system of black hole mass larger than @xmath8 .",
    "disk oscillations may cause a periodic change of accretion and the qpos in x - ray black hole binary system @xcite , which could lead to periodic jet emission due to the jet - disk coupling .    to understand the physical origin of periodic outbursts , it is essential to investigate in details the structure of periodic outbursts in both light curves and power density spectrum , and the dependence of periodicity on the observational wavelengths .",
    "for example , the discovery of double peaks in the periodic optical outbursts of the bl lac object oj287 @xcite leads to the second version of the smbhb model @xcite , while the investigation of the relation of the optical outburst structure and the radio variations leads to the third version of the smbhb scenario @xcite .",
    "it is generally believed that the short - term variabilities of blazars are non - periodic ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but the short - term periodic brightness flickering may have been found to superpose on the long - term periodic variations in some blazars , e.g. oj287 @xcite and 3c66a @xcite . in order to give more constraints on the models for periodic outbursts in agns , recently we started a program to investigate the relationships of periodic major outbursts and minor events and the long- and short - term periodicities of a large sample of agns @xcite . here",

    "the multiple qpos in the radio light curves of ao 0235 + 164 are due to quasi - periodic injection of plasma from an oscillation thick disk of a finite radial extent into relativistic jet .",
    "a torus or a thick accretion disk of finite radial extent oscillates and accretes matter quasi - periodically with small integer ratio of frequencies with 1:2:3:@xmath9 , if it is perturbed by a global perturbation or a local strong periodic agent @xcite .",
    "the fundamental oscillation frequency of a thick disk is determined by the radial extent and sound speed .",
    "we estimated the central black hole mass @xmath255 and the dimensionless accretion rate @xmath256 of ao 0235 + 164 , based on the observations of emission line properties .",
    "the estimated dimensionless accretion rate with the current knowledge of accretion around black hole suggests that the inner region of accretion disk in ao 0235 + 164 is a geometrically thick disk ( i.e. adaf or riaf ) with radial extent about @xmath257 and the outer region is a truncated cool thin disk . with the self - similar solution of adaf",
    ", we analytically estimate the fundamental oscillation frequency @xmath258 or period @xmath259 in the observer s frame , which together with the predicted overtones are consistent with the observed multiple qpos with lowest frequency @xmath260 ( or @xmath261 at higher accuracy ) and harmonics . as there is no natural global or strong local perturbation source in standard smbhb - accretion disk system to excite the global oscillations of a thick disk of a large radial extent @xmath262",
    ", we suggest a smbhb rotating within the thick disk to excite the p - mode oscillations of riaf in ao 0235 + 164 .",
    "the rotation of the secondary triggers acoustic waves in an adaf ( or riaf ) , which propagate inwards and outwards in the thick disk and are reflected backwards by the inner and outer boundaries . the p - mode oscillations with frequencies of about the fundamental oscillation frequency and",
    "the overtones are trapped by the cavity .",
    "the orbital motion of a smbhb could lead to the formation of a helical morphology of relativistic jet and to the rapid changes of vlbi jet position angles .",
    "therefore , in the smbhb - disk oscillation model , the relativistic jet can be also helical .",
    "the orbital motion may correspond to the 6th qpo with @xmath263 , the 2nd qpo with @xmath264 , or have not been observed .",
    "long term vlbi monitoring of rapid changes of jet positional angles would help to answer the question .",
    "one of the differences with the simple helical jet model is that in the smbh - thick disk oscillation scenario the minor burst events in the radio light curves is no longer random but together with the major outbursts are the combinations of harmonic six qpos which are the p - mode oscillations of the riaf and the binary orbital motion .",
    "this is a first time report of multiple harmonic qpos and the possible detection of perturbed disk p - mode oscillations in agns .",
    "the second difference of predictions of the helical jet model and the smbhb - thick disk oscillation scenario is that periodic outbursts in the former model are persistent and regular while in the later scenario are temporary with moderate coherence quality factor @xmath33 and depend on the dimensionless accretion rate . in the smbhb - thick oscillation scenario ,",
    "resonant harmonic qpos would disappear from the radio light curves or the periodic activities of the radio source are interrupted , when the accretion rate increases only about two times aand becomes larger than the critical accretion rate @xmath265 and the inner region of accretion disk becomes a geometrically thin cool disk .",
    "therefore , the quiescence and the absence of outbursts from the radio light curves of ao 0235 + 164 may be because of the transition of accretion mode from a riaf to a standard thin cool accretion disk due to the moderate increase of accretion rate .",
    "the x - ray spectral observations with the chandra satellite in august 2000 and with the xmm - newton satellite in august 2004 show tentative detections of the red - shifted fe k@xmath136 fluorescent emission line in ao 0235 + 164 @xcite , which suggests that the accretion disk at the immediate vicinity of the smbh is very likely a standard thin accretion disk @xcite .",
    "therefore , the absence of outbursts from the radio light curves and the interruption of the harmonic qpos can be understood in the smbhb - thick disk oscillation scenario as the transition of accretion mode due the increase of accretion rate . in a jet - disk coupling scenario ,",
    "an object becomes radio quiet when the accretion disk becomes a standard thin disk @xcite .",
    "we notice that in the helical jet model , the separation of smbhb is much smaller than the transitional radius @xmath184 of inner thick riaf and outer thin disk .",
    "therefore , the smbhb in the helical jet model for ao 0235 + 164 should also excite the p - mode oscillations of an riaf , leading to quasi - periodic accretion and quasi - periodic injection of plasma into the relativistic jet .",
    "therefore , multiple qpos with harmonic relationship are also expected by the helical jet model for ao 0235 + 164 , if we consider the riaf p - mode oscillations .    the embedding secondary black hole spherically accretes matter from the riaf and radiates energy in x - ray .",
    "the accretion radius of the secondary black hole is @xmath266 , where @xmath267 is the differential velocity of the secondary black hole and the plasma in the thick disk . for a minor merger with @xmath268 ,",
    "we obtain @xmath269 and @xmath270 . from the self - similar solution @xmath271 for @xmath204 @xcite",
    ", we have @xmath272 .",
    "the accretion rate of the secondary black hole is @xmath273 where the mass density @xmath274 is given with the self - similar solution and @xmath275 . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : secacc ] ) , we have @xmath276 . defining the eddington accretion rate for the secondary black hole @xmath277 with @xmath278",
    ", we have the dimensionless accretion rate of the secondary black hole , @xmath279 . for the typical parameters",
    "@xmath280 and @xmath281 , the relative accretion rate of the secondary is @xmath282 , while @xmath283 for @xmath284 .",
    "the x - ray emission from the accretion of the secondary black hole is small and may not be observable in ao 0235 + 164 , because of the strong x - ray radiations both from the relativistic jet and from accretion disk around the primary .",
    "a different @xmath4 value does not change the conclusion .",
    "our work implies that if a thick accretion disk with finite radial extent is perturbed globally or locally by , e.g. smbhb , the p - mode oscillations can be observed as multiple harmonic qpos , when the relativistic jet is along the line of sight .",
    "periods have been reported and smbhbs have been suggested in literature for many agns .",
    "so , multiple qpos with a harmonic relationship of frequencies are expected by the smbhb - disk oscillation model in moderately low luminosity agns with smbhb at center , which may have accretion configuration like the one in the bl lac object ao 0235 + 164 .",
