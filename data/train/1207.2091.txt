    "<S> we construct families of symmetric , antisymmetric , and asymmetric solitary modes in one - dimensional bichromatic lattices with the second - harmonic - generating ( @xmath0 ) nonlinearity concentrated at a pair of sites placed at distance @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> the lattice can be built as an array of optical waveguides . </S>",
    "<S> solutions are obtained in an implicit analytical form , which is made explicit in the case of adjacent nonlinear sites , @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the stability is analyzed through the computation of eigenvalues for small perturbations , and verified by direct simulations . in the cascading limit , which corresponds to large mismatch @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> the system becomes tantamount to the recently studied single - component lattice with two embedded sites carrying the cubic nonlinearity . </S>",
    "<S> the modes undergo qualitative changes with the variation of @xmath3 . in particular , at @xmath4 , the symmetry - breaking bifurcation ( sbb ) , which creates asymmetric states from symmetric ones , is supercritical and subcritical for small and large values of @xmath3 , respectively , while the bifurcation is always supercritical at @xmath2 . in the experiment , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding change of the phase transition between the second and first kinds may be implemented by varying the mismatch , via the wavelength of the input beam . </S>",
    "<S> the existence threshold ( minimum total power ) for the symmetric modes vanishes exactly at @xmath5 , which suggests a possibility to create the solitary mode using low - power beams . </S>",
    "<S> the stability of solution families also changes with @xmath3 . </S>"
