    "ultrarelativistic ultraperipheral production of mesons and elementary particles is a special category of nuclear reactions @xcite .",
    "the ultrarelativistic ions provide large fluxes of quasi - real photons which can collide leading to different final states .",
    "both total photon - photon cross sections as well as cross section for particular simple final states are interesting .",
    "the nuclear cross section is usually calculated in the equivalent photon approximation in momentum space @xcite , or in impact parameter space @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the flux of photons depends on the transverse distance from the heavy ion trajectory .",
    "impact parameter space is very convenient to exclude cases when both heavy ions collide , i.e. , when they do not survive the high - energy collision . in the past",
    "we have performed also full momentum space calculation for @xmath20 production @xcite . in the momentum space calculation ( epa or full calculation ) the effects of nucleus - nucleus collisions and their associated break - up",
    "are neglected .",
    "this effect is rather small for light particle production such as @xmath21 often studied in the literature .",
    "recently we have studied several processes initiated by the photon - photon collisions such as : @xmath22 @xcite , @xmath20 @xcite , @xmath23 @xcite , @xmath24 @xcite and for high mass dipions @xcite .",
    "we have shown there that the inclusion of realistic charge form factors , being fourier transforms of realistic charge distributions , is crucial for estimating reliably the nuclear cross sections .    here , we shall apply the previously used method for the exclusive production of @xmath25 and @xmath26 .",
    "the present analysis is an extension of the analysis of high - mass dipion production @xcite where we concentrated exclusively on perturbative qcd effects .    the elementary reactions @xmath15 and @xmath14 are interesting by themselves , since understanding the mechanism of the @xmath0 reaction at low or intermediate energies ( @xmath27 1.5 gev ) is very important for applications of chiral perturbation theory and pion - pion interaction @xcite .",
    "at higher photon - photon energies the brodsky - lepage @xcite and hand - bag @xcite mechanisms have been discussed in the literature .",
    "in addition , we study the contribution of glueballs or glueball candidates @xcite . only estimates of the total cross section were presented in the literature @xcite recently . in general , it is not possible to observe glueballs , even if the corresponding cross section is sizeable .",
    "one should concentrate on a concrete final state .",
    "the @xmath28 channels are a good example .",
    "estimation of the background and its interplay with resonant signal should be better understood .",
    "here we show how the glueball candidates can be seen in reality when analyzing e.g. dipion spectra .    in the present paper",
    "we construct a hybrid , multi - component model for the @xmath0 reactions which describes all experimentally available world data .",
    "we shall extend the range of the photon - photon energies to the region where the transition from nonperturbative qcd to pqcd may be expected .",
    "it is very important to understand the onset of the pqcd effects .",
    "for example the hand - bag mechanism @xcite is usually fitted to experimental data for energies bigger than 2.5 gev .",
    "the @xmath0 processes are fairly complicated .",
    "different mechanisms may contribute in general .",
    "the present analysis is partially an update of an old analysis in ref.@xcite . in the present paper",
    "we shall try to understand both @xmath14 as well as @xmath15 processes simultaneously , from the kinematical threshold ( @xmath29 ) up to the maximal experimentally available energy @xmath30 6 gev .",
    "we will include both soft and hard continuum processes as well as s - channel resonances .",
    "here we shall include many more resonances compared to ref.@xcite .",
    "in addition , we shall try to describe the new very precise data of the belle collaboration @xcite , including the angular distributions of pions .",
    "our paper concentrates on realistic predictions of the cross sections for dipion production in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "we shall present first realistic predictions for @xmath31 reaction at the lhc .",
    "both total cross sections and differential distributions will be shown and discussed for the first time in the literature .",
    "the photon - photon induced dipion production in nuclear collision , interesting by itself , constitutes a background to another type of nucleus - nucleus reactions induced by photon - pomeron ( pomeron - photon ) exchanges leading to a coherent production of @xmath32 meson @xcite and its radial excitations .",
    "the interplay of the both processes was not discussed so far in the literature .",

    "the qed born amplitude for the @xmath39 reaction with point - like particles has been known for a long time .",
    "an interesting problem is to construct the qed amplitude for real , finite - size , pions .",

    ". while the predictions for the @xmath32 production are rather uncertain ( within factor two or three ) , our predictions for the @xmath58 process should be fairly precise ( a few percent precision ) . a comparison with real data",
    "should be therefore interesting . at larger",
    "dipion invariant masses , other radial excitation may appear in addition .",
    "the @xmath59 state is a first candidate of this type .",
    "since the continuum single - photon photoproduction @xmath25 background in this region was not studied , we have no information about its interference with the @xmath59 resonance .",
    "therefore in the following we shall show only the resonance contribution and leave the question of the background for future analyses , including perhaps the alice experimental data .",
    "here we parametrize the @xmath59 contribution as : @xmath60 the cross section for the photoproduction of @xmath59 was calculated only in ref.@xcite .",
    "this calculation finds that the cross section for the @xmath59 resonance is about a factor 5 smaller than for @xmath57 .",
    "here we are discussing the signal in the @xmath25 channel , therefore a corresponding branching fraction has to be included in addition .",
    "unfortunately this branching fraction is not well known .",
    "the crystal ball collaboration has measured only the ratio of the cross section for two and four pion channels @xcite .",
    "they have found @xmath61 = 0.37 @xmath62 0.1 . in this situation",
    "we can only calculate an upper limit for the two - pion branching fraction : @xmath63     invariant mass distribution of @xmath1 from the decay of @xmath57 and @xmath59 photo - production ( resonance contributions represented by the dashed and dotted lines ) and our @xmath18 fusion ( solid line ) in ultraperipheral pb - pb collisions at @xmath64 3.5 tev.,width=302 ]    in fig.[fig : dsig_dw_rho ] the resonance contribution for the @xmath59 is 5/0.27 times smaller than for @xmath57 as suggested by the calculation @xcite and the above upper limit for the branching fraction into pions .",
    "it is therefore clear that this will be an upper estimate for the @xmath59 contribution .",
    "the relative contribution of @xmath59 is still somewhat larger than observed for instance in the electroproduction of these states at hera @xcite . in ref.@xcite an anomalous ( strongly nucleus mass and photon virtuality dependent ) production of @xmath59",
    "has been predicted for incoherent production in the @xmath65 reaction .",
    "we wish to emphasize in addition that our estimate does not take into account experimental cuts of any concrete experiment .    the photoproduction contribution cross sections are above our photon - photon fusion one .",
    "it is not clear in the moment how the kinematical cuts may change the proportions of the two mechanisms .",
    "this will be studied elsewhere .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath66 reaction is free of the photoproduction mechanisms .",
    "however , it is not clear for us if , in this case , a measurement is possible .",
    "in the present paper we have discussed first @xmath15 and @xmath14 reactions and we have shown that different mechanisms contribute to such processes below @xmath67 6 gev .",
    "these are : pion exchange for the @xmath25 channel , several resonances such as @xmath68 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath8 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 and pqcd mechanisms proposed first by brodsky and lepage as well as hand - bag mechanism proposed by diehl , kroll and vogt .",
    "we have included also pion - pion rescattering which leads to a coupling between the @xmath1 and @xmath3 channels .",
    "we have shown that the inclusion of such processes can help in understanding energy dependence of the @xmath0 processes as well as angular distributions only at very low energies .",
    "we have not tried to get a perfect fit to the data as several details of the model amplitudes are not known .",
    "we have slightly adjusted some parameters to get a reasonable description of the data .",
    "we have found that the decay width @xmath69 is much smaller than that found in other partial wave analyses .",
    "the data ( total cross section as well as angular distributions ) close to the position of @xmath6 peak can be described assuming the dominance of the amplitude +    @xmath70 .",
    "we have included also the tensor @xmath10 resonance , considering two models of the corresponding @xmath0 amplitude .",
    "a better description of the data has been obtained using    @xmath71 ,    i.e. , space , different than for @xmath6 .",
    "this may mean that the structure of this resonance is completely different than that for @xmath6 , @xmath9 or @xmath11 ( @xmath72 states ) .",
    "inclusion of the @xmath12 spin-4 resonance improves the spectrum and angular distributions around the resonance position . by fitting to the belle collaboration data we have found @xmath73 = 0.7 @xmath62 0.1 kev .    at still higher energies the situation is even less clear .",
    "while in the @xmath25 channel the brodsky - lepage mechanism with distribution amplitude discussed recently in the context of the babar data describes the data , in the  smaller  @xmath26 channel more processes may contributed in addition to the bl pqcd mechanism .",
    "another possibility is the hand - bag mechanism proposed some time ago by diehl , kroll and vogt .",
    "the hand - bag mechanism may be important only at energies @xmath74 3 gev .    at high energies",
    "the angular distributions show an enhancement at large @xmath75 for the @xmath15 . such an enhancement is predicted both , by the brodsky - lepage and by the hand - bag approaches .",
    "a proper mixture of both processes provides a better description of the experimental data than each of them separately , as done usually in the literature .",
    "having fixed the details of the amplitude we have calculated total cross sections and angular distribution as a function of @xmath58 energy for both @xmath14 and @xmath15 processes .",
    "these two subprocess energy - dependent cross sections have been used next in equivalent photon approximation in the impact parameter space to calculate for the first time corresponding production rate in ultraperipheral ultrarelativistic heavy ion reactions . in this calculation",
    "we have taken into account realistic charge distributions in colliding nuclei .",
    "we have calculated both total cross sections at lhc energy , as well as distributions in rapidity and transverse momentum of pions and dipion invariant mass .",
    "the calculation of distributions of individual pions is slightly more complicated in the b - space epa .",
    "the distributions in dipion invariant mass have been compared with the contribution of exclusive @xmath76 production in photon - pomeron ( pomeron - photon ) mechanism taken from the literature .",
    "close to the @xmath32 resonance the @xmath14 mechanism yields only a small contribution .",
    "the @xmath58 contribution could be , perhaps , measured outside of the @xmath32 resonance window .",
    "a detailed comparison with the absolutely normalized alice experimental data should allow a quantitative test of our predictions .",
    "imposing several experimental cuts may enhance the @xmath77 contribution .",
    "in the present paper we have analysed exclusive production of two pions . in principle",
    "exclusive production of four pions could be also interesting .",
    "first experimental study has been presented in @xcite .",
    "interesting theoretical study has been performed in @xcite .",
    "in our model , the amplitude for the @xmath0 process is a coherent sum of different contributions ( amplitudes ) for different mechanisms : @xmath78 where @xmath79 , @xmath80 are initial photon helicities .",
    "there are only four combinations of helicities defining the , in general , complex amplitude : ( -1,1),(1,-1),(1,1),(-1,-1 ) .    as a consequence",
    "the differential distributions for the @xmath0 reaction can be written in terms of spherical harmonics numbered with pion - pion angular momentum projection ( @xmath81 ) @xmath82 the expansion coefficients @xmath83 are strongly energy dependent . in general , resonance contributions ( l = 0 , 2 , 4 ) interfere with slowly - energy - dependent backgrounds ( l = 0 , 2 , 4 , ... ) of different origin discussed in previous sections .",
    "recently the belle collaboration @xcite has performed a simplified fit to the experimental angular distributions of the type : @xmath84 our model shows that such a simplified partial wave expansion has not always model justification and may therefore lead sometimes to unphysical solutions .",
    "however , the correct partial wave decomposition ( see ( eq.[partial_wave_expansion ] ) ) of experimental angular distributions is in practice too difficult , if not impossible .",
    "we are indebted to nikolai achasov and wolfgang schfer for interesting exchange of informations and christoph mayer for a discussion of alice experiment and exchange of a few experimental details as well as careful reading of our manuscript .",
    "this work was partially supported by the polish grant n  n202 078735 , n n202 236640 and dec-2011/01/b / st2/04535 .",
