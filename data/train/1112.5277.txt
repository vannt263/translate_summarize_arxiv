    "elementary excitations or collective modes are key properties of bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) , and serve as probes of the ground states .",
    "the bogoliubov theory of elementary excitations of bec gives an elegant description of the goldstone modes associated with the spontaneous breaking of @xmath1 symmetry  @xcite . in recent years",
    ", bec of ultra - cold dilute atomic gases has become one of the most active fields in physics . among the most interesting topics",
    "are bec of spinor atomic gases  @xcite , for example , spin-1 and pseudospin-@xmath0 gases  @xcite , as well as spinless mixtures  @xcite . as an extension of this topic , it is interesting to study spinor mixtures with interspecies spin exchange",
    ". it has been theoretically found that a mixture of two distinct species of pseudospin-@xmath0 atoms with interspecies spin - exchange interaction exhibits interesting features beyond both spinor gases and a mixture of spinless gases , especially , in a broad parameter regime , the ground state is entangled between the two species , rather than bec of individual species  @xcite .",
    "also , the approach based on single orbital - mode approximation has revealed interesting properties of quantum phase transition and many - particle quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "we expect our work motivates more investigations along this line of research .",
    "spin - exchange scattering between distinguishable atoms has been less studied , perhaps because of incomplete information on inter - atomic potential .",
    "however , we note that interspecies spin - exchange interaction can be significant . there are calculations indicating significant spin - exchange scattering lengths between distinguishable atoms  @xcite",
    ". spin - changing scattering between distinguishable atoms has indeed been observed  @xcite .",
    "experiments on multi - component bose gases often had atom loss due to spin exchanges  @xcite .",
    "significant differences between singlet and triplet scattering lengths have been observed in @xmath2k-@xmath3rb , @xmath4-@xmath3rb and @xmath5li(@xmath6li)-@xmath7na mixtures  @xcite , implying significant interspecies spin exchanges .",
    "it is feasible to experimentally realize the systems studied here .",
    "one may use , for example , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , or @xmath10 and @xmath9 , as the two species , and @xmath11 and @xmath12 as the two pseudospin states  @xcite .    in this paper , we treat a mixture of two distinct species of pseudospin-@xmath0 bose gases by using a field theory approach beyond single orbital - mode approximation . from the point of view of field theory",
    ", there are four fields , as there are two species of atoms while each atom has two relevant spin states .",
    "we shall use the path integral formalism to develop a bogoliubov - like mean field theory , in which each field has a specific value in the ground state .",
    "excitations are then calculated as small deviations of the fields from those in the ground state .",
    "previously , elementary excitations in such a mixture have been studied as fluctuations of the single - particle orbital wave functions , and it has been restricted to a special parameter point , in which the many - body ground state is the so - called entangled bec  @xcite . on the other hand , when the atoms are all condensed in the same orbital wave functions , there are spin excitations described by the effective spin hamiltonian  @xcite . in the approach here ,",
    "the spin excitations are obtained as due to spin flipping of the fields that remain spatially homogeneous , while the elementary excitations are plane - wave - like excitations of the phases of the fields .",
    "the former is the long - wavelength limit of the gapped mode among the elementary excitation .",
    "furthermore , the low energy effective theory gives the excitation spectrum of the effective spin hamiltonian that is obtained under single orbital - mode approach .",
    "consider a dilute gas of two species of bosonic atoms , the number of atoms in each species is conserved .",
    "each atom possesses an internal degree of freedom represented as a pseudospin with @xmath13-component basis states @xmath14 and @xmath15 , and can transit between the two .",
    "this system is described by four interacting boson fields , with the lagrangian density @xmath16 where @xmath17 represent the two species and @xmath18 represents the two basis states of pseudospin-@xmath0 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the field and the chemical potential corresponding to the atoms of species @xmath21 with pseudospin @xmath22 , respectively , @xmath23 is the hamiltonian density @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the external potential , @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the interaction strengths for intraspecies scattering , interspecies scattering without spin exchange , and interspecies spin - exchange scattering respectively , proportional to the corresponding scattering length . for pseudospin-@xmath0 atoms , intraspecies",
    "scattering strengths with and without spin - exchange are the same  @xcite",
    ".    for simplicity , we set @xmath29 , and also assume @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath32 such that @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "we can define @xmath34 , the spin density operator @xmath35 , @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the single spin operator , @xmath38 being the pauli matrix .",
    "then the hamiltonian density can be written as @xmath39 where @xmath40 , @xmath41 .    if @xmath42 , the system is a mixture without interspecies spin exchange , equivalent to a mixture of four scalar bose gases .",
    "note that intraspecies spin exchange does not change the particle number occupying each pseudospin state . the hamiltonian would possess a symmetry of @xmath43 , corresponding to particle number conservation of all the four fields . with @xmath44 ,",
    "the symmetry is lowered to @xmath45 , corresponding to the conservations of @xmath46 , @xmath47 as well as @xmath48  @xcite .",
    "we consider the parameter regime @xmath49 , with all the other parameters fixed .",
    "other parameter regimes are studied elsewhere . as a mean field theory",
    ", we suppose that in the ground state , each of the four fields has a definite value @xmath50 .",
    "then the spin exchange term becomes @xmath51 .",
    "minimizing the potential part of the lagrangian requires @xmath52 , @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "we can arbitrarily choose the phases of the four fields under the above constraint to describe a ground state , other choices are equivalent in the sense of spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "therefore in the ground state , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the number density of species @xmath21 , with @xmath58 being the volume of the system . the chemical potential is evaluated to be @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",

    "this lagrangian has a cosine term similar that in the sine - gordon model . in @xmath76",
    ", this term leads to a solution of topological soliton , which has very nontrivial contribution to the phase diagram , as discussed elsewhere .",

    "@xmath126 may be negative in some cases , which means that the mean - field ground state with @xmath127 , @xmath128 is unstable and a phase transition occurs . from the secular equation",
    "we see that @xmath129 is satisfied for any @xmath130 if and only if the matrix @xmath131 is positive definite , as the matrix @xmath132 is positive definite while @xmath133 is semi positive - definite .",

    "that is , @xmath174    the effective hamiltonian ( [ hamil ] ) can be solved easily .",
    "it can be seen that @xmath175 , @xmath176 and @xmath177 are conserved quantities , because @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath178 are conserved .",
    "the effective hamiltonian can be rewritten as @xmath179 where @xmath180 .",
    "@xmath181 , @xmath182 and @xmath183 are all conserved , while the part depending of @xmath184 and @xmath185 is like the hamiltonian of a harmonic oscillator .",
    "therefore the spectrum of @xmath186 is @xmath187 where @xmath188\\ ] ] is fixed , @xmath116 is nothing but the energy gap in ( [ gap ] ) . in the ground state ,",
    "@xmath189 , @xmath190 , thus the energy is @xmath191 where @xmath192 is the zero - point energy of homogeneous fluctuation ( that is , the @xmath193 part of ( [ excitation1 ] ) and ( [ excitation2 ] ) ) .",
    "the excitation energy of the homogeneous excitation is @xmath194 where @xmath195 .",
    "it can be seen that the fourth elementary excitation , discussed in the last section , reduces to the homogeneous excitation as @xmath196 .",
    "for the ground state of a bose gas , usually the approximation of the single orbital mode works very well and is the common practice . for our system",
    ", this approximation means that only one orbital mode is contained in each field , that is , @xmath197 , @xmath198 denotes the annihilation operator of the orbital mode function @xmath199 .",
    "then the spin operator for species @xmath21 is @xmath200 , and thus the hamiltonian @xmath201 becomes , up to a constant , @xmath202 where @xmath203 and @xmath204 are effective parameters determined by the interaction strengths as well as single particle orbital wave functions and energies .",
    "then the total spin @xmath205 of the system is conserved . in the the uniform case , @xmath29",
    ", it can be found that @xmath206 , @xmath207 , where @xmath58 is the volume of the system .    under the single orbital - mode approximation , @xmath197 , the elementary excitation ,",
    "that is , the fluctuated phase factor @xmath208 with a wave - like dependence on @xmath209 and @xmath210 , can only be attributed to the fluctuation of the orbital wave function @xmath199 .",
    "this verifies the previous treatment of elementary excitation using the gross - pitaevskii - like equation governing the single - particle orbital wave functions . only in the long - wavelength limit ,",
    "the gapped elementary excitations reduces the homogeneous excitation .    for a homogeneous excitation ,",
    "the phase factor @xmath211 is position independent , and be attributed to spin degree of freedom .",
    "hence a homogeneous excitation is a spin excitation , with the orbital degree of freedom remaining the same as those in the ground state . as such",
    ", these excitations should be the same as those of the effective spin hamiltonian @xmath212 obtained under single - orbital mode approximation .",
    "as such , the energy spectrum of a homogeneous excitation ( [ excite ] ) can be approximately equalized with the spectrum of @xmath212 , that is @xmath213 which , for @xmath214 , reduces to @xmath215    we have numerically solved the effective spin hamiltonian @xmath212 and compared the result with the the above expression of spectrum ( [ en ] ) . as shown in figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , they fit very well for small @xmath216 . for a bose gas in absence of a magnetic field , @xmath217 is very large while @xmath178 is very small .",
    "hence in ( [ en ] ) , unless @xmath190 , the first term is much smaller than the second term .",
    "therefore , the low - lying states must be those with a certain small @xmath178 and with @xmath190 .",
    "this firmly indicates that our field theory and the single orbital - mode approximation fit very well for low energy excitations .",
    "this result also confirms a previous perturbative treatment of the anisotropic coupling between the collective spins  @xcite .",
    "both the unperturbed isotropic hamiltonian and the anisotropic perturbation conserve @xmath178 , hence the eigenstate is a superposition of states @xmath218 with a same value of @xmath178 and different values of @xmath205 .",
    "the expansion coefficients turn out to be the `` wave functions '' of a harmonic oscillator in coordinate @xmath205 , also giving the spectrum ( [ en ] ) .",
    "the total spin @xmath205 is indeed equivalent to @xmath219 , as the angle between the collective spins of the two species is just @xmath220  @xcite .",
    "@xmath221 as a function of @xmath178 with @xmath190 .",
    "@xmath222 and n is the particle number . the + s are the numerical solution of @xmath212 , and the solid line is the plot of @xmath223 .",
    "they fit extremely well . ]",
    "@xmath221 as a function of @xmath216 with @xmath189 .",
    "@xmath222 and n is the particle number . the dashed line represents the numerical solution of @xmath212 and the solid line is the plot of @xmath224 .",
    "note that the low lying excited states correspond to small values of @xmath216 , for which the low energy field theory and the single orbital mode approximation fit well . ]",
    "we have described the low energy excitations of a mixture of two species of pseudospin-@xmath0 bose gases with interspecies spin exchanges , which entangles the two species of atoms when the system undergoes bec . from the point of view of quantum field theory , we have considered a four - component field with various interactions .",
    "we developed a low energy effective field theory , which can very well describe various low energy excitations in a unified framework .",
    "as an interesting generalization of the usual bogoliubov theory for the present multicomponent bose gas with spin degree of freedom , this theory gives four elementary excitations .",
    "the most interesting aspect is the gap in one of the four excitations . on the other hand",
    ", quantizing homogeneous excitations yields the excitation spectrum which can be attributed to spin degree of freedom .",
    "interestingly , this leads to an analytical solution of the effective spin hamiltonian obtained under single orbital - mode approximation .",
    "the elementary excitations or collective modes can be measured by using the bragg spectroscopy , based on two - photon bragg scattering  @xcite . especially , several modes coexisting at a given value of momentum transfer can be excited and measured  @xcite . for a trapped gas , the collective modes can also be measured by perturbing the trapping potential  @xcite .",
    "similarly , the excitations discussed in our work can be experimentally measured by using the above method .",
    "the homogeneous excitations can also be measured , in a way similar to the measurement of collective modes in a trap , which are not plane waves  @xcite .",
    "the gap in a collective mode is a feature nonexisting in the usual mixtures , where the particle number of each spin state is conserved  @xcite .",
    "the nonvanishing value of @xmath117 , which accounts for the gap , as well as @xmath225 , which characterizes the difference of scattering lengths of like - spin and unlike - spin scattering processes , both originate from the interspecies spin exchange interaction . therefore @xmath117 and @xmath225 are roughly of the same order of magnitude .",
    "many experiments have been carried out to measure this interaction  @xcite , indicating a considerably large value of scattering length , which is about @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the bohr radius .",
    "therefore we expect that experimentally this system can be realized and that the gapped mode can be found .",

    "<S> we develop a low energy effective field theory of a mixture of two species of pseudospin-@xmath0 atoms with interspecies spin - exchange , in addition to density - density interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this approach is beyond the single orbital - mode approximation . in a wide parameter regime </S>",
    "<S> , it indicates the existence of the four elementary excitations , especially a gapped mode due to interspecies spin - exchange . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the effective spin hamiltonian yielded by the single mode approximation can be obtained by quantizing the homogeneous excitation , which is spin excitation and is the long - wavelength limit of the gapped mode of elementary excitations . </S>",
    "<S> these low energy excitations can be experimentally measured by using bragg spectroscopy . </S>"
