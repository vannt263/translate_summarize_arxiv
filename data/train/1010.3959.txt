    "the diamond nitrogen - vacancy ( nv ) center consisting of a substitutional nitrogen atom and an adjacent vacancy has attracted considerable attention since the first report of optically detected magnetic resonance on single nv center in 1997 @xcite .",
    "due to sufficiently long electronic spin lifetime as well as the possibility of coherent manipulation at room temperature @xcite , the nv center is considered as a promising building block for room - temperature quantum computing in the future to , room - tem , shi .",
    "since the electronic spins could be well initialized and manipulated in optical fashion , the qubit readout and gating regarding single - spin state have been achieved in individual nv centers @xcite . by virtue of the hyperfine couplings with the paramagnetic nuclei in the vicinity of the electron spin , i.e. , @xmath0c @xcite , @xmath1n @xcite , and @xmath2n @xcite ,",
    "currently available techniques have demonstrated the quantum information storage and retrieval between electronic and the nuclear spins @xcite .",
    "this technique also enables rapid and high - fidelity readout of quantum information from the electron spin @xcite .",
    "however , coherence between electron and nuclear spin qubits is restricted to the case of a few qubits owing to the limited number of nuclear spins individually addressable in frequency space @xcite .",
    "so for scalability , it is necessary to develop methods of coupling distant nv centers .",
    "we have noticed a recent experiment to entangle a pair of separate nv centers within a diamond based on magnetic dipolar coupling @xcite .",
    "but this idea is pretty hard for scalability . for distant nv centers with magnetic dipolar coupling",
    "unavailable , the best way for spin - spin entanglement seems to make use of parity projection by detecting the emitted photons relevant to different spin states @xcite .",
    "however , the nv centers , although similar to the atomic cases , only allow linearly polarized radiations in the laser excitation , which makes coincident detection of emitted photons unavailable .",
    "in addition , to effectively produce entanglement of nv centers by parity projection of photons , we require that the ` which - path ' information be removed due to interference after the photons go through the beam splitter . but",
    "experimental reports so far have shown that @xmath3 of the emitted photons reside in broad photon sidebands to the resonant zero phonon line ( zpl ) at 637 nm even in cryogenic situation @xcite .",
    "this implies that the most photons emitted from the nv centers could not effectively interfere in the beam splitter .",
    "alternatively , the entanglement of separate nv centers could be achieved by coupling to the same cavity mode . in a recent publication @xcite , we proposed an idea to entangle more than two nv centers by one step of implementation , based on coupling to a microsphere cavity .",
    "the key idea of that proposal is the employment of the spin singlet state @xmath4 to encode a qubit . to our knowledge , however , this metastable @xmath4 state , although investigated from @xmath5 group theory considerations @xcite and other aspects , has not yet been fully understood @xcite . as a result ,",
    "most of the present work for quantum information processing with nv centers encode qubits only in the sublevels of the ground state @xmath6 .",
    "we focus in this work on entangling distant nv centers without employing the state @xmath4 .",
    "specifically , we encode qubits in two of the ground state splittings , and the excited states are auxiliary with spontaneous emission effectively suppressed during our operation . the key point of our idea is to present a generalized jaynes - cummings model involving a quantized whispering - gallery mode ( wgm ) and @xmath7 identical nv centers .",
    "wgm microcavities are of typically dielectric rotational - symmetry structures with wgms traveling around the curved boundary and confined by continuous total internal reflection @xcite . in particular",
    ", the technological advance has made it available to have strong light - matter coherent coupling in wgm resonators with smaller mode volume @xmath8 and extremely high - quality factor @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "recent experimental progresses about the nanocrystal - microsphere system also provide experimental evidence for strong coupling between nv centers and the wgm of silica microsphere park , polystyrene microsphere @xcite , and gallium - phosphide microdisk @xcite , respectively .",
    "in addition , a latest experiment has demonstrated the technique for deterministically coupling a single nv center to a photonic crystal cavity @xcite .",
    "so far there have been much development in wgm cavities with the forms , such as the microtoroidal tor , microcylinders @xcite , microdisks @xcite , and microspheres @xcite .",
    "we will show how to generate @xmath10 state @xcite and bell states for these distant nv centers in such a composite nanocrystal - microsphere system .",
    "the main results of this work are twofold : first , by virtue of raman transitions , we show the possibility with virtual - photon - induced excitation in a large detuning case to generate multipartite w state with separate nv centers in different diamond nanocrystals , where the growth of the qubit number corresponds to the decrease of the operational time .",
    "secondly , resorting to adiabatic passage technology @xcite , we create bell states of any pairs of qubits via dark - state evolution , which is robust to the cavity decay .",
    "identical nv centers in diamond nanocrystals are equidistantly attached around the equator of a single fused - silica microsphere cavity .",

    "as sketched in fig . 1(a ) and 1(b ) , @xmath7 identical nv centers , respectively , in @xmath7 separate diamond nanocrystals could be strongly coupled to the wgm of a microsphere cavity or of a microtoroidal cavity .",
    "the nv center is a point defect in the diamond lattice , which consists of a nearest - neighbor pair of a nitrogen - atom impurity substituting a carbon atom and a adjacent carbon vacancy , as shown in fig .",
    "1(c ) . in the case of microspheres ,",
    "wgm can be characterized by angular @xmath21 , azimuthal @xmath22 , and radial @xmath23 numbers .",
    "high values of @xmath9 usually correspond to the modes with @xmath24 .",
    "of greatest interest is the so - called fundamental wgm ( @xmath25 ) , whose field is concentrated in the vicinity of the equatorial plane of the sphere .",
    "it is believed that these modes can be selectively excited by coupling to a tapered fiber @xcite . like in @xcite , our proposal",
    "is also based on recent experimental and theoretical progresses , i.e. , the possibility of @xmath26-type configuration of the optical transition in nv center system @xcite and the considerable enhancement of the zpl by embedding the nv centers in some cavities @xcite .",
    "but differently , the entanglement of the nv centers is achieved without involving the metastable @xmath27 state . in our case",
    ", we assume that each nv center located in a diamond nanocrystal is attached around the equator of a single fused - silica microsphere cavity @xcite or microtoroidal cavity @xcite .",
    "this composite nanocrystal - microsphere system takes advantage of the exceptional spin properties of nv centers as well as the ultrahigh quality factor @xmath9 @xmath28 even up to 10@xmath29 , very small volume ( @xmath30 @xmath31 ) and simple fabrication technique of the cavity @xcite . for convenience of description ,",
    "we will below mention the wgm , but not relating the mode to any concrete cavity .    by combining laser pulses with carefully timed interaction with the wgm , one can model the nv center as a @xmath32-type three - level system as shown in fig .",
    "1(d ) , where the states @xmath33 and @xmath34 serve as the logical states @xmath35 and @xmath36 of the qubit , respectively , and the state @xmath37 is labeled by the state @xmath38 . in our case ,",
    "the wgm with frequency @xmath39 is far - off resonant from the transition @xmath40 ( with the frequency @xmath41 ) , and the levels @xmath36 and @xmath42 ( with transition frequency @xmath43 ) are coupled by a largely detuned laser with frequency @xmath44 and polarization @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "the nv centers are fixed and apart with the distance much larger than the wavelength of the wgm , interacting individually with laser beams .",
    "so the direct coupling between nv centers is negligible . assuming that the detuning @xmath46 is sufficiently larger than the coupling strength @xmath14 and @xmath47 the excited state @xmath48 can be adiabatically eliminated .",
    "thus quantum logic gates and multipartite entangled states are available in the subspace spanned by @xmath49 and @xmath50 . using the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) , the hamiltonian in the interaction picture can be written in units of @xmath51 as @xcite @xmath52,\\]]where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator of the wgm field .",
    "@xmath56 with @xmath57 and @xmath58 for simplicity , we assume that the detuning @xmath59 and the interaction term @xmath60 are identical for each qubit , that is , @xmath61 and @xmath62 in the case of @xmath63 there is no energy exchange between the wgm and nv centers . if the quantized wgm is initially in the vacuum state , the effective hamiltonian could be simplified as @xcite @xmath64,\\ ] ] where the first term corresponds to the dynamical energy shift regarding the level @xmath36 , and the photon - dependent energy shift of the level @xmath49 is removed due to the vacuum state of the cavity .",

    "here we have neglected the wgm decay because the cavity decay rate could be @xmath120 mhz in the case of @xmath121 which is much smaller than the effective coupling rate @xmath122 .",
    "the characteristic spontaneous emission rate @xmath123 regarding the states @xmath50 and @xmath124 could be estimated as @xmath125 @xcite , where @xmath126 is the spontaneous decay rate of the excited state @xmath38 @xcite .",
    "so the evolution of the system is described by the lindblad equation @xcite @xmath127+\\gamma _ { eff}(2\\sigma ^{-}\\rho \\sigma ^{+}-\\sigma ^{+}\\sigma ^{-}\\rho -\\rho \\sigma ^{+}\\sigma ^{-}).\\]]fig .",
    "3 shows the fidelity of the state @xmath128 when the spontaneous decay is considered . with increase of @xmath123 ,",
    "the fidelity decreases accordingly .",
    "however , our scheme can still achieve a high fidelity as long as the spontaneous decay is weak . in a realistic experiment",
    ", the situation would be more complicated than our consideration above . as a result , to carry out our scheme with high efficiency and high fidelity",
    ", we have to suppress above mentioned imperfect factors as much as we can .",
    "under raman resonance conditions between two zeeman sublevels of the ground state , we focus on generating bell state with any pairs of nv centers ( e.g. , @xmath129 and @xmath130 ) in the nanocrystal - microsphere system , via adiabatic passage of the dark states @xcite . the adiabatic passage @xcite is a useful and robust technique for quantum - state manipulation .",
    "it is a method of using two time - separated but partially overlapping pulses in the counterintuitive sequence to produce complete population transfer or an arbitrary coherent superposition between the initial and final states .",
    "the difference from the above section is that the wgm and the laser pulses should be in resonance with the transitions @xmath131 and @xmath132 , respectively , as shown in fig .",
    "4 .     and",

    "so noteworthy features of our scheme are as follows : ( i ) in principle , the excited states of nv centers are negligibly populated due to dark state dominant in the evolution , so the preparation of the bell state is immune to spontaneous emission ; ( ii ) the cavity decay exists only for a short time with the intermediate state @xmath159 populated , whereas the satisfied condition @xmath160 makes the detrimental influence from the cavity decay negligible during the operations",
    ". we will justify these points by numerics later .",
    "note that the method of dark - state evolution can be also applied to quantum information transfer ( qit ) between any pairs of nv centers , where the the original quantum information is encoded on the nv center @xmath129 as @xmath161 ( @xmath162 and @xmath163 are arbitrary coefficients ) , which can be coherently transferred to the nv center @xmath130 ( initially prepared in @xmath164 state ) via raman transitions induced by a pair of time - delayed laser pulses .",
    "we can apply such a `` counterintuitive '' pulse sequence from @xmath165 to @xmath166 , namely , the pulse on nv center @xmath130 precedes the pulse on nv center @xmath129 , which guarantees that the adiabatic transfer of the quantum information could be achieved .",
    "compared with the creation of bell state , there is only a slight modification on the step ( iii ) in above mentioned procedure , i.e. , slowly changing the rabi frequencies to meet the condition @xmath167 @xmath142 , rather than @xmath168 @xmath169 .",
    "in addition , different from in preparing bell state , the initial state @xmath170 will drive the system to undergo a different dark - state evolution involving two dark states @xmath171 and @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is another dark state regarding the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "the qit process could be briefly expressed as @xmath174      without losing generality , we consider two nv centers with the identical parameters and two laser pulses with gaussian envelops @xmath175 and @xmath176 , where @xmath177 is the maximal value of @xmath178 at the central time @xmath179 for the pulse @xmath11 ( @xmath180 ) , @xmath181 is the laser beam waist .",
    "5 presents the numerical treatment for the qit process : @xmath182 .",
    "we have compared the population of @xmath183 in an ideal dark - state evolution described by eq .",
    "( 5 ) with that in the decay case .",

    "the time delay @xmath195 between two pulses @xmath140 and @xmath139 of the same step is chosen to be equal to @xmath181 to minimize the nonadiabatic losses sang .",

    "the only thing we need to do is keeping the phase differences stable between the laser pulses @xmath204 and @xmath205 , which is easily controllable experimentally .",
    "it should be mentioned that the fidelity of the bell state @xmath206 depends only on the ratio of the wgm - nv coupling constants @xmath207 and @xmath208 after the laser pulses @xmath209 and @xmath210 are turned off . if @xmath207 and @xmath208 are not the same , the two nv centers will be prepared in the state @xmath211 with the fidelity @xmath212 $ ] .",
    "we examine the feasibility of our scheme and survey the relevant experimental parameters .",
    "as stated above , nv centers are well suited for cavity qed because they have a long electron spin relaxation time and their electronic states can be initialized , manipulated , and measured through highly stable optical and microwave excitations at room temperature .",
    "additionally , wgm microcavities exhibit exciting characteristics such as extremely high - quality factor @xmath9 , small mode volume @xmath8 , and excellent scalability , which makes it possible to achieve high concentration of the optical field and relatively long photon confinement times .",
    "experimentally , single n - v centers strongly coupling to a wgm have been demonstrated in different kinds of microcavities @xcite , which are great advances in wgm - based cavity qed research .    in the composite nanocrystal - microsphere system ,",
    "we focus our attention on the dipole transition @xmath213 with a zpl at @xmath214 @xmath215 of the nv centers in diamond nanocrystal . in above - mentioned wgm - nv experiments ,",
    "the nv centers actually interact with the evanescent field of the wgm .",
    "the evanescent field is of importance because it offers the effective way to energy exchange between the wgm and the external nv center .",
    "thus , we assume that single nv centers are located near the microcavity surface in order for the wgm - nv coupling @xmath216 to reach @xmath217 @xmath218 ghz @xcite with the parameters in the sec .",
    "2.2 . in the fused - silica microsphere cavity , the small radius of 10 @xmath108 m could lead to a vacuum electric field of @xmath219 v / cm at the sphere surface and to the @xmath9 factor exceeding 10@xmath220 , which imply the wgm decay rate to be @xmath221 mhz .",
    "experimental studies have demonstrated @xmath9 factors approaching @xmath222 in a silica wgm microsphere @xcite , with values exceeding 10@xmath223 readily achievable over a broad range of cavity diameters and wavelengths .",
    "the strong coupling strongly depends on the critical photon number @xmath224 and the critical atom number @xmath225 , which gives the number of photons required to saturate a nv - qubit , and the number of nv - qubit required to have an appreciable effect on the wgm cavity transmission , respectively @xcite .",
    "based on these parameters , one can find that the strong coupling conditions @xmath226 @xmath227 and @xmath228 could be well satisfied in our scheme .",
    "nevertheless , in realistic experiments , wgms are dominantly confined inside of the microcavity body , and only the remaining energy of the wgm can be resident in the exterior evanescent field . thus the coherent coupling strength can not reach its maximum .",
    "this is the reason that the maximal wgm - nv coupling in current experiments only reaches @xmath229 mhz @xcite .",
    "there is an increasing interest in the development of alternative microcavity systems .",
    "we note that a recent experiment @xcite has demonstrated an enhanced coherent interaction between the wgm and quantum dots using a kind of plasmonic wgm highly localized on the exterior surface of a metal - coated microtoroidal .",
    "another alternative soultion is using the silica microtoroidal coated with a high - refractive - index ( hri ) nanolayer @xcite .",
    "the key idea is that this hri nanolayer can compress the radial wgm field and move the wgm field in the coated microtoroidal to the outside of the silica surface .",
    "note that the preparation of entangled states and implementation of qit via dark states are similar in spirit to the other atom @xcite and atom - like systems @xcite .",
    "however , we consider here a different system , and our proposal has several merits as follows .",
    "firstly , the nv center in diamond is the only currently known viable solid - state qubit at room - temperature , and the center s highly localized bound states are well isolated from sources of decoherence .",
    "so the ground state can exhibit extremely long spin coherence time of up to _ millisecond _ , which is close to the regime needed for quantum error correction @xcite .",
    "secondly , the proposed qit protocol has the potential of scalability because our qit protocol does not require identical wgm - nv coupling strength , which implies that neither identical qubits nor exact placement of nv centers in cavities is needed .",
    "thirdly , as the nv center nanocrystals are required to be attached along the equator of the microsphere with spacing bigger than the laser wavelength , individual addressing is not an obstacle in our scheme .    the two schemes above require different conditions in implementation .",
    "for example , in the first scheme the wgms are detuned from the transitions in the nv centers , while the second scheme requires resonant coupling between the wgms and the nv centers .",
    "if we employ the same wgm cavities to accomplish the schemes , the detuned and the resonant couplings regarding the wgm radiation could be achieved by changing the temperature of the system @xcite .    in current experiments ,",
    "the electron spin relaxation time @xmath230 of diamond nv centers ranges from 6 ms at room temperature @xcite to sec at low temperature .",
    "in addition , the dephasing time @xmath231350 @xmath108s induced by the nearby nuclear - spin fluctuation has been reported @xcite . a latest experimental progress @xcite with isotopically pure diamond sample has demonstrated a longer t@xmath232 , i.e. , t@xmath2332 ms . in our scheme ,",
    "the operation times for preparing four - qubit w state , the two - qubit bell state , and for accomplishing qit are about 31.3 ns , 6.786 ns , and 8.0 ns , respectively . hence even at room temperature , up to @xmath234 gate operations are feasible under the present experimental conditions .    for more technical aspects ,",
    "to make sure the nv centers to be strongly and nearly equally coupled to the wgm cavity , we have to simultaneously attach separate nv centers around the equator of a single fused - silica microsphere resonator .",
    "the experimental difficulty lies in how to fix the nanocrystals appropriately with respect to the wgm .",
    "so far the strong coupling between a single nv center and the wgm of a silica microsphere @xcite and a gallium - phosphide microdisk @xcite , and between two nv centers and a polystyrene microsphere @xcite have been experimentally achieved .",
    "so we wish this would be soon extended to more nv centers .",
    "further consideration would involve nuclear spins in the nv centers , which are more suitable to store quantum information due to longer decoherence time . in this sense",
    ", we may also consider quantum computation with nv centers combining nuclear spins with electron spins , i.e. , encoding the qubits in the nuclear spins and employing the electron spins as ancillas .",
    "the hyperfine interaction helps to transfer the generated entanglement of the electron spins to the corresponding nuclear spins of nv centers @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have proposed two schemes to prepare w state and bell state with separate nv centers in the diamond nanocrystal - microsphere system , respectively . in both of these schemes , the cavity decay and the spontaneous emission from the excited states could be effectively suppressed .",
    "particularly , in the latter scheme with the adiabatic passage , the qit is robust against the experimental parameter fluctuation .",
    "our ideas could be applied to other cavity systems , besides the wgm - type cavities .",
    "the number of the entangled nv centers depends on the ratio of the size of the employed microcavity to the nanocrystal size . for more nv centers to be entangled ,",
    "detection of emitted photons by parity projection would be necessary @xcite . in this sense",
