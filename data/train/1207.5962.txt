    "it is possible to discriminates the relic waves from other sources on the observational point of view also .",
    "the relic gravitational waves are paramount importance in cosmology because it provides valuable information on the conditions of very early universe .",
    "it is believed that the relic gravitational waves are mainly generated during inflationary epoch . and the waves that amplified during the inflation are low frequency only . since the higher frequency waves are outside the `` barrier '' ( horizon)@xcite the corresponding amplitudes decreased during the evolution of the universe .",
    "the features of relic gravitational waves of very high frequency range is interesting though the energy scale of conventional inflationary models are not favoring for it .",
    "however if extra dimensions exist ( for a review , see @xcite and motivation for extra dimensions @xcite ) the graviton background can have a thermal spectrum @xcite .",
    "according to the extra dimensional models the thermal gravitons with very high frequency range also be observed with a specific peak temperature today @xcite and therefore the detection of very high frequency thermal gravitational waves is an interesting test to see the possibility of existence of extra dimensions as well .",
    "these thermal gravitational waves can contribute to the higher frequency range of the spectrum .",
    "the existence of thermal graviton background with the black body type spectrum is also discussed in @xcite,@xcite .",

    "the generation of tensor perturbations during inflation by the stimulated emission process leads to the existence of thermal gravitational waves @xcite .",
    "direct detection of the thermal gravitons is challenging but may be possible in the near future with the 21-cm emission line of atomic hydrogen .",
    "the inflationary scenario @xcite predicts a stochastic cosmic background of gravitational waves ( cgwb ) @xcite .",

    "the focus of the present work is on the spectrum of the higher frequency range of the waves due to extra dimensional effects .",
    "the normalization of the spectrum is being done with the measured cmb anisotropy spectrum of the wmap .",
    "the inclusion of the higher frequency relic thermal gravitational waves leads to enhancement of the spectrum .",
    "this enhancement leads to modification of the amplitude of the spectrum in the frequency range ( 10@xmath0 -10 @xmath1 hz ) as an additional feature and is possible to compare these with the sensitivity of advanced.ligo ( adv.ligo ) , einstein telescope ( et ) and lisa missions .",

    "before the discovery of accelerating expansion of the universe , the current expansion is used to take as decelerating one because of the matter - dominated stage . thus , following the matter - dominated stage , it reasonable to add an epoch of accelerating stage , which is probably driven by either the cosmological constant , or the quintessence , or some other kind of condensate @xcite .",

    "the power spectrum for the primordial perturbation of energy density is @xmath97 and in terms of initial spectral index @xmath98 , it is defined as @xmath99 .",

    "but , according to the @xmath5cdm concordance model the present universe is supposed to be driven by dark energy resulting an accelerated phase . if this is the case then the spectral property of the waves to be studied by taking into account of the current acceleration of the universe . in the present work we mainly considered the very high frequency range ( the low frequency range thermal gravitational case is carried out by us without including the very high frequency thermal waves that comes from extra dimensional scenario and the work is under preparation .",
    "the enhancement of the lower frequency range is shown with red lines , see figs.[[ff1],[ff2 ] ] ) of relic gravitational waves in the thermal vacuum state and obtained the spectrum for the accelerated as well as decelerated models .",
    "the obtained spectra are normalized with the wmap data .",
    "it is observed that the inclusion of the very high relic thermal gravitational waves leads to a discontinuity in the amplitude of the spectrum at @xmath265 ( see fig.[[ff1 ] ] ) .",
    "this is due to the fact that the temperature dependent term is insignificant in the higher frequency side of the range @xmath266 . to evade this problem a new equation of line",
    "is derived and thus the amplitude get enhanced in the range @xmath267 .",
    "this is the new feature of the spectrum and we designates it as the ` modified amplitude ' of the spectrum .",
    "the modified amplitude of the spectrum can be compared with the sensitivity of the adv.ligo , et and lisa missions .",
    "the comparison of the adv.ligo sensitivity shows that the modified amplitude is unlikely to detect with its current stands of lisa or the improved sensitivity of adv.ligo .",
    "where as the proposed sensitivity of the et is promising to verify the modified amplitude with its upcoming mission data .",
    "the spectral energy density of the gravitational waves is estimated in thermal vacuum state for the accelerated and decelerated universe .",
    "it is observed that the spectral energy density get enhanced in the lower frequency range @xmath259 and from the higher frequency range it is @xmath260 .",
    "a comparison of the estimated upper bound of spectral energy density of various studies with the present work is done .",
    "it shows that @xmath242 and @xmath268 are less than the estimated upper bound of various studies .",
    "the total estimated value of @xmath262 by including the very high frequency thermal relic gravitational waves does not alter the upper bound of the nucleosynthesis rate .",
    "thus the relic thermal gravitons with very high frequency range are not ruled out and is testable with the upcoming data of various missions for detecting gravitational waves .",
    "cosmology with extra dimensions have been motivated since kaluza and klein ( kk ) showed that classical electromagnetism and general relativity could be combined in a five - dimensional framework .",
    "the modern scenarios involving extra dimensions are being explored in particle physics , with most models possessing either a large volume or a large curvature .",
    "although there exist different models of extra dimensions , there are some general features and signals common to all of them .    in presence of @xmath269 extra spatial dimensions",
    ", the 3+d+1- dimensional action for gravity for can be written as @xmath270,\\ ] ] where @xmath271 and @xmath272 is the four dimensional metric , @xmath273 is newton s constant , @xmath274 and @xmath275 denote the higher dimensional counter parts of the metric , newton s constant , and the ricci scalar , respectively .",
    "@xmath276 is the fundamental scale of the extra dimensional theory .    since the gravitational interactions are not strong enough to produce a thermal gravitons at temperatures below the planck scale ( @xmath277 gev ) , the standard inflationary cosmology predicted the existence the cosmic gravitational waves background which are non - thermal in nature .",
    "however if the universe contains extra dimensions that can generate the thermal gravitational waves and its shape and amplitude of the cgwb may change significantly .",
    "this can happen when energies in the universe are higher than the fundamental scale @xmath278 , the gravitational coupling strength increases significantly , as the gravitational field spreads out into the full spatial volume . instead of freezing out at @xmath279 , as in 3 + 1 dimensions , gravitational interactions freeze - out at @xmath280 .",
    "if the gravitational interactions become strong at an energy scale below the reheat temperature ( @xmath281 ) , gravitons get the opportunity to thermalize , creating a thermal cgwb .",
    "the qualitative result , the creation of a thermal cgwb if @xmath282 , is unchanged by the type of extra dimensions chosen @xcite .",
    "thus , if extra dimensions do exist , and the fundamental scale of those dimensions is below the reheat temperature , a relic thermal cgwb ought to exist today .",
    "compared to the relic thermal photon background ( cmb ) , a thermal cgwb would have the same shape , statistics , and high degree of isotropy and homogeneity .",
    "the energy density ( @xmath283 ) and fractional energy density ( @xmath284 ) of a thermal cgwb are @xmath285 where @xmath286 is the critical energy density today , @xmath287 is the present temperature of the cmb , and @xmath288 is the number of relativistic degrees of freedom at the scale of @xmath278 .",
    "@xmath288 is dependent on the particle content of the universe , i.e. whether ( and at what scale ) the universe is supersymmetric , has a kk tower , etc .",
    "other quantities , such as the temperature ( t ) , peak frequency ( @xmath203 ) , number density ( @xmath98 ) , and entropy density ( @xmath289 ) of the thermal cgwb can be derived from the cmb if @xmath288 is known , as @xmath290 these quantities are not dependent on the number of extra dimensions , as the large discrepancy in size between the three large spatial dimensions and the @xmath269 extra dimensions suppresses those corrections by at least a factor of @xmath291 . if @xmath278 is just barely above the scale of the standard model , then @xmath292= 106.75 .",
    "the thermal cgwb then has a temperature of 0.905 kelvin , a peak frequency of 19 ghz @xcite .",
    "authors would like to thank s.hild for providing the et sensitivity data and also adv.ligo and lisa web .",
