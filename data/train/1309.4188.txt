    "the standard model _ a la _ hot big bang has several remarkable successes to its credit which include the predictions of expansion of universe @xcite , existence of microwave background radiation @xcite and synthesis of light elements in the early universe",
    "there is a definite mechanism for structure formation in the standard model : tiny perturbations of primordial nature may grow via gravitational instability into the structure we see today in the universe .",
    "these inhomogeneities were observed by cobe in 1992 @xcite .",
    "the hot big bang model requires the tiny perturbations for observational consistency and structure formation but nevertheless lacks a generic mechanism for their generation .",
    "the latter is seen as one of the fundamental difficulties associated with the standard model .",
    "the other shortcomings include flatness problem , horizon problem and few more which belongs to the list of logical inconsistencies of the standard model where as the problem of primordial perturbations is directly related to observation .",
    "the said difficulties are beautifully addressed by the inflationary paradigm .",
    "interestingly , cosmological inflation was invented to tackle the logical inconsistencies of hot big bang .",
    "as for density perturbations , it turned out later that they could be generated quantum mechanically during inflation and then amplified to the required level which certainly came as a big bonus for inflation .",
    "it , therefore , became clear around 1982 that standard model needs to be complimented by an early phase of accelerated expansion @xmath0",
    "the inflation @xcite .",
    "+ there is one more inconsistency of observational nature , the standard model of universe is plagued with @xmath0 the age of universe in the model falls shorter than the age of some well known objects in the universe @xcite .",
    "the age crisis is related to the late time expansion as universe spent most of its time in the matter dominated era for the simple reason that the expansion rate changed fast in the radiation dominated phase . at early epochs",
    ", universe expands fast and particles move away from each other with enormous velocities ; the role of gravity is to decelerate this motion .",
    "higher is the matter density present in the universe , less time the universe would spend to reach a given expansion rate , in particular , the present hubble rate , thereby leading to less age of universe .",
    "but whatever percentage of matter we have in the universe today is an objective reality and we can do nothing with it .",
    "the only known way out in the standard model is then to introduce a repulsive effect to encounter the influence of normal matter which could then allow us to improve upon the age of universe .",
    "thus , we again need an accelerated phase of expansion at late times to address the age crisis @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that the late time cosmic acceleration was directly observed in 1998 in supernovae ia observations @xcite and was confirmed by indirect observations thereafter @xcite .",
    "+ it is interesting that accelerated expansion plays an important role in the dynamical history of our universe : the hot big bang model is sandwiched between two phases of fast expansion @xmath0 inflation @xcite and late time cosmic acceleration @xcite needed to solve the generic inconsistencies of the standard model of universe .",
    "late time cosmic acceleration is an observed phenomenon at present @xcite where as similar confirmation for inflation is still awaited . + in cosmology , observations supersede theoretical model building at present .",
    "what causes late time cosmic acceleration is the the puzzle of the millennium .",
    "there are many ways of obtaining late time acceleration @xcite but observations at present are not yet in position to distinguish between them .",
    "broadly , the models aiming to address the problem come in two categories @xmath0 the standard lore based upon einstein theory of general relativity ( gr ) with a supplement of energy momentum tensor by an exotic component dubbed _ dark energy _",
    "@xcite and scenarios based upon _ large scale modification of gravity _ @xcite .",
    "+ which of the two classes of models has more aesthetics is a matter of taste .",
    "let us first briefly discuss the dark energy scenario .",
    "the simplest model of dark energy is based upon cosmological constant @xmath1 which is an integral part of einstein s gravity .",
    "all the observations at present are consistent with the model based upon cosmological constant @xmath0 @xmath2 . however , there are difficult theoretical problems associated with @xmath1 . with a hope to alleviate these problems ,",
    "one tacitly switches off @xmath1 without justification and introduces scalar fields with generic cosmological dynamics which would mimic cosmological constant at present .",
    "unfortunately , scalar field models are faced with problems similar to cosmological constant . as for the standard lore , to be fair , cosmological constant performs satisfactorily on observational grounds and unlike scalar fields does not require adhoc assumption for its introduction . + what goes in favor of modified theories of gravity ?",
    "well , einstein theory of gravity is directly confronted with observations at the level of solar system ; it describes local physics with great accuracy and is extrapolated with great confidence to large scales where it has never been verified directly .",
    "we know that gravity is modified at small distances via quantum corrections , it might be that it also suffers modification at large scales .",
    "and it is quite natural and intriguing to imagine that these modifications give rise to late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "what kind of modifications to gravity can be expected at low energies or at large scales ?",
    "weinberg theorem tells us that einstein gravity is the unique low energy field theory of ( massless ) spin 2 particles obeying lorentz invariance .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that most of the modified theories of gravity are represented by einstein gravity plus extra degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , @xmath3 @xcite contains a scalar degree of freedom with a canonical scalar field uniquely constructed from ricci scalar and the derivative of @xmath3 with respect to @xmath4 .",
    "a variety of modified schemes of gravity can be represented by scalar tensor theories . in this",
    "set up , the extra degrees of freedom normally mixed with the curvature ; action can be diagonalized by performing a conformal transformation to einstein frame where they get directly coupled to matter .",
    "all the problems of modified theories stem from the following requirement .",
    "the extra degrees of freedom should to give rise to late time cosmic acceleration at large scales and become invisible locally where einstein gravity is in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "local gravity constraints pose real challenge to large scale modification of gravity ; spacial mechanisms are required to hide these degrees of freedom .",
    "broadly there are two ways of suppressing them locally .",
    "( 1 ) chameleon screening @xcite : this mechanism is suitable to massive degrees of freedom such that the masses become very heavy in high density regime allowing to escape their detection locally . ( 2 ) vainshtein screening @xcite suitable to massless degrees of freedom , operates via kinetic suppression such that around a massive body , in a large radius known as vainshtein radius , thank to non - linear derivative interactions in the lagrangian , the extra degrees of freedom gets decoupled from matter switching off any modification to gravity locally .",
    "+ in case of massive gravity @xcite , we end up adding three extra degrees of freedom one of which , namely , the longitudinal degree of freedom ( @xmath5 ) is coupled to source with the same strength at par with the zero mode and leads to vdvz discontinuity @xcite in linear theory . in @xmath6 @xcite , in decoupling limit , valid limit to tackle the local gravity constraints , the longitudinal mode gets screened by the non - linear derivative terms of the field @xmath5 dubbed galileon @xcite .",
    "+ models of large scale modifications based upon chameleon mechanism are faced with tough challenges : these models are generally unstable under quantum corrections as the mass of the field should be large in high density regime in order to pass the local physics constraints @xcite . in attempt to comply with the local physics ,",
    "one also kills the scope of these theories for late time cosmic acceleration@xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "vainshtein mechanism is a superior field theoretic method of hiding extra degrees of freedom and is at the heart of recently formulated ghost free model of massive gravity@xmath0 @xmath6 .",
    "apart from the superluminality problem @xcite of @xmath6 inherent to galileons @xcite , it is quite discouraging that there no scope of freidmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmology in this theory @xcite .",
    "it is really a challenging task to build a consistent theory of massive gravity with a healthy cosmology .",
    "+ in this paper , we shall briefly review the problems associated with dark energy and focus on problems and prospects of modified theories of gravity and their relevance to late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "the review is neither technical nor popular , it is rather a first introduction to the subject and aims at a wider audience .",
    "+ in this review , we would stick to metric signature,@xmath7 and denote the reduced planck mass as @xmath8 .",
    "we hereby give an unsolicited advise to the reader on the follow up of the review . the section on cosmological constant",
    "should be complemented by the ref.@xcite for a thorough understanding of the problem . for a detailed study of scalar field dynamics ,",
    "we refer the reader to the review@xcite .",
    "reader interested in learning more on modified theories of gravity , supported by chameleon mechanism , is recommended to work through the reviews@xcite . in our description of massive gravity",
    ", we resorted to heuristic arguments in several places in order to avoid the technical complications .",
    "after reading the relevant section , we refer the reader to the exhaustive reviews@xcite on the related theme .",
    "the friedmann - robertson - walker model is based on the assumption of homogeneity and isotropy _ a la _ cosmological principal the dialectical materialism view on the genesis of universe was based upon a similar principal which can be found in the classic work by frederick engels , `` dialectics of nature '' . according to this ideology ,",
    "universe is infinite , had no beginning , no end and always appears same thereby leaving no place for god in it .",
    "the hoyle - narlikar steady state theory is based upon the perfect cosmological principle and it would have been extremely pleasing had the study state theory succeeded but we can not force nature to make a particular choice , even the most beautiful one!]which is approximately true at large scales . the small deviation from homogeneity in the early universe seems to have played very important role in the dynamical history of our universe .",
    "the tiny density fluctuations are believed to have grown via gravitational instability into the structure we see today in the universe . + homogeneity and isotropy forces the metric of space time to assume the form , @xmath9 where @xmath10 is scale factor .",
    "eq([frw ] ) is purely a kinematic statement which is an expression of maximal spatial symmetry of universe thanks to which full information of cosmological dynamics is imbibed in a single function@xmath0 a(t ) .",
    "einstein equations allow us to determine the scale factor provided the matter contents of universe are specified .",
    "constant @xmath11 occurring in the metric ( [ frw ] ) describes the geometry of spatial section of space - time .",
    "its value is also determined once the matter distribution in the universe is known . in general ,",
    "einstein equations @xmath12 are complicated but thank to the maximal symmetry , expressed by ( [ frw ] ) , get simplified and give rise to the following evolution equations , @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are density and pressure of matter filling the universe which satisfy the continuity equation , @xmath16 for cold dark matter , @xmath17 ( equation of state parameter @xmath18 ) and it follows from ( [ cont ] ) that @xmath19 , where the subscript `` 0 '' designate the respective quantities at the present epoch . in case of spatially flat universe , @xmath20 , the scale factor @xmath21 can be normalized to _ a priori _ given value , say at unity .",
    "in other cases , its value depends on the matter content in the universe .",
    "+ the nature of expansion expressed by the equations ( [ freq])@xmath22 ( [ aceq ] ) depends upon the nature of the matter content of universe . it should be emphasized that in general theory of relativity , pressure contributes to energy density and the latter is a purely relativistic effect . the contribution of pressure in eq([aceq ] ) can qualitatively modify the expansion dynamics .",
    "indeed , eq.([aceq ] ) tells us that @xmath23    accelerated expansion , thus , is fueled by an exotic form of matter of large negative pressure @xmath0_dark energy _",
    "@xcite which turns gravity into a repulsive force .",
    "the simplest example of a perfect fluid of negative pressure is provided by cosmological constant associated with @xmath24 . in this case the continuity equation ( [ cont ] ) yields the relation @xmath25 . keeping in mind the late time cosmic evolution , let us write down the evolution equations in matter dominated era in presence of cosmological constant ,    @xmath26    it is instructive to cast these equations in the form to mimic the motion of a point particle in one dimension .",
    "eq.([aceq1 ] ) can be put in the following form , @xmath27 whereas the friedmann equation acquires the form of total energy of the mechanical particle , @xmath28     .",
    "the initial positions ( a ) and ( b ) correspond to motion of system beginning from a = 0 and @xmath29 . for @xmath30 and @xmath31",
    ", we have oscillating and bouncing solutions depending whether the motion commences from configuration ( a ) with @xmath32 or from configuration ( b ) with @xmath33 .",
    "einstein static solution(@xmath34 ) corresponds to the maximum of the potential .",
    "the case of @xmath35 is similar to @xmath36 such that the kinetic energy is always sufficient to overcome the barrier . ]",
    "the potential @xmath37 is concave down and has a maximum where the kinetic energy is minimum ( see , fig.[potc ] ) , @xmath38 where @xmath39 .",
    "if we imagine that motion in fig.[potc ] commences on the left of the hump , the kinetic energy is always sufficient to overcome the barrier for @xmath20 and @xmath40 where as in case of @xmath41 , we get a bound on the value of @xmath42 to achieve the same .",
    "observations have repeatedly conformed the spatially flat nature of geometry @xmath43 @xcite which is consistent with the prediction of inflationary scenario and we shall adhere to the same in the following discussion . in this case , starting from position ( a ) , see fig[potc ] , one can always reach ( c ) and before one reaches the hump , motion decelerates followed by acceleration thereafter .",
    "observations have shown that this transition takes place at late times . in order to appreciate it ,",
    "let us write ( [ heq1 ] ) in the form , @xmath44;~ \\omega_m=\\frac{\\rho_m^0}{\\rho_{cr}},~\\omega_\\lambda=\\frac{\\rho_\\lambda}{\\rho_{cr}},~\\rho_{cr}=\\frac{3h_0 ^ 2}{8\\pi g}\\ ] ]    it then straight forward to estimate the numerical value of @xmath45 for which the kinetic energy , @xmath46\\ ] ] is minimum and that happens when , @xmath47 where we have introduced redshift @xmath48 which quantifies the effect of expansion . using the observed values of dimensionless density parameters , @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we find that @xmath51 which tells us that transition from deceleration to acceleration , indeed , took place recently .",
    "+ let us note that cosmological constant is not the only example of negative pressure fluid , a host of scalar field systems can also mimic a negative pressure fluid .",
    "an important comment about negative pressure systems is in order .",
    "the introduction of @xmath1 does not require an adhoc assumption , the latter is always present in einstein equations by virtue of bianchi identities .",
    "in fact in four dimensions , the only consistent modification(without invoking the extra degrees of freedom)that the einstein equations allow in the classical regime is given by , @xmath52 .",
    "actually , this is the other way around that one should provide justification if one wishes to drop the cosmological constant from einstein equations ; there exists no symmetry at low energies to justify the latter . as for the scalar fields ,",
    "their introduction is quite adhoc and on the top of every thing , one switches off @xmath1 for no known reason .",
    "scalar fields , however , may be of interest if they are inspired by a fundamental theory of high energy physics .      at early epochs",
    ", radiation dominates , its energy density is large , as a result , the expansion rate is also large . consequently , it does not take much time to reach a given expansion rate in the early universe .",
    "for instance , universe was around @xmath53 years old at the radiation matter equality which is negligible compared to the age of universe .",
    "it is therefore clear that most of the contribution to the age of universe comes from matter dominated era at late stages . in order to appreciate the role of @xmath1 ,",
    "let us switch it off in the friedmann equation .",
    "then for matter dominated universe ( @xmath20 ) , the friedmann equation ( [ freq ] ) readily integrates to , @xmath54 and specializing to the present epoch , we have @xmath55 recent observations reveal that @xmath56 which falls much shorter than the age of some well known objects ( around 14 billion years ) in the universe @xcite . actually , the factor of @xmath57 in ( [ age ] ) spoils the estimate .",
    "let us argue on physical grounds as how to address the problem .",
    "in presence of normal matter , gravity is attractive and it decelerates the motion . if gravity could be ignored , then using the hubble law , @xmath58(@xmath59 ) , we could have , @xmath60 which is what is required .",
    "however , we can not ignore gravity , there is around 30 @xmath61 of matter present in the universe which causes deceleration of the expansion and reduces the age of universe .",
    "the only way out to decrease the influence of the matter is to introduce a repulsive effect necessary to encounter the gravitational attraction of normal matter .",
    "let us stress that this is the only known possibility to improve upon the age of universe in the standard model of universe . indeed using the friedmann equation",
    ", we can estimate the time universe has spent starting from the big bang till today or the age of universe @xmath62 ,    @xmath63    where we have used the change of variable , @xmath64 .",
    "the age of the universe is then finally given by , @xmath65 expression ( [ agel ] ) tells us that @xmath66 for the observed values of density parameters , @xmath50 and @xmath49 .",
    "thus the _ late time inconsistency of hot big bang cries for cosmological constant_. +   it is really interesting to note that there exists no such problem in hoyle - narlikar steady state cosmology @xcite which thanks to the perfect cosmological principal has no beginning and no end .",
    "also , the study state theory imbibes cosmic acceleration and does not suffer from the logical inconsistencies the standard model is plagued with .",
    "unfortunately , the model faces problems related to thermalization of the microwave background radiation . however , the generalized steady state theory dubbed `` quasi steady state cosmology '' ( qssc ) formulated by hoyle , burbidge and narlikar claims to explain the cmbr as well as derive its present temperature which the big bang can not do@xcite .",
    "it is clear from the aforesaid that cosmological constant is essentially present in einstein equations as a free parameter which should be fixed by observations .",
    "sakharov pointed out in 1968 @xcite that quantum fluctuations would correct this bere value . in flat space time , according to sakharov , a field placed in vacuum would have energy momentum tensor @xmath67 uniquely fixed by relativistic invariance . @xmath68",
    "dubbed vacuum energy density is constant by virtue of conservation of energy momentum tensor . keeping in mind the perfect fluid form of the energy momentum tensor , we have , @xmath69 which is the expression of relativistic invariance .",
    "the curved space time generalization is given by @xmath70 which should be added to the bare value of cosmological constant present in einstein equations , @xmath71    a free scalar field is an infinite collection of non interacting harmonic oscillators whose zero point energy is the vacuum energy of the scalar field , @xmath72 and incorporating spin does not change the estimate . expression ( [ vew ] ) is formally divergent and requires a cut off .",
    "one normally cuts it off at planck s scale as an expression of our ignorance and concludes that @xmath73 . using then the friedmann equation expressed through dimensionless density parameters ,    @xmath74    one finds , @xmath75 which is the source of a grave problem . and",
    "since , @xmath76 it follows that @xmath77 should cancel @xmath68 to a fantastic accuracy , typically , at the level of one part in @xmath78 .",
    "the supernovae ia observation in 1998 revealed that effective vacuum energy is not only small , it is of the order of matter density today .",

    "+ we should point out a flaw in the above arguments@xcite .",
    "we should bear in mind that the cut off used on 3-momentum violates lorentz invariance and might lead to wrong results . in what follows , we shall explicitly demonstrate it .",
    "lorentz invariance signifies a particular relation between vacuum energy @xmath68 and vacuum pressure @xmath80 , namely , @xmath81 .",
    "similar to the vacuum energy , the vacuum pressure is formally divergent and also requires a cut off .",

    "hence @xmath68 and @xmath80 given by ( [ rhov ] ) @xmath22 ( [ pv ] ) are valid estimates for any field placed in vacuum .",
    "secondly , as mentioned before , for lorentz invariance to hold we should have @xmath81 which is clearly violated by the first terms in ( [ rhov ] ) and ( [ pv ] ) . it should be noted that this is the first term in these expressions which gives contribution proportional to @xmath86 . as for the second terms with logarithmic dependence on the cut off , they are in accordance with lorentz invariance .",
    "+ it is therefore clear that we should employ a regularization scheme which respects lorentz invariance .",
    "for instance , dimensional regularization is suitable to the problem",
    ". let us first transform the integral from four to @xmath87 dimension , @xmath88 where the scale @xmath89 is introduced to take care of the units in @xmath87 dimensional case and @xmath90 is the solid angle .",

    "we have successfully isolated the divergence without violating lorentz invariance .",
    "we then subtract out infinity to obtain the final result , @xmath96 in order to estimate the vacuum energy , we should imagine all the fields placed in vacuum and sum up their contributions .",
    "to be pragmatic , we use the following data from standard model of particle physics to estimate @xmath68 @xmath97 clearly the stage is set by the heaviest scale in the problem , the mass of the top quark . as for the scale @xmath89 , it is always estimated by the physical conditions . in the problem under consideration",
    ", the energy scale , @xmath89 , is set by the critical energy density and the energy density characterized by the wavelength of light received from supernovae , @xmath98 which shows that effective vacuum energy density is down by sixty four orders of magnitude compared to the one obtained using the lorentz violating regularization . and",
    "this considerably reduces the fine tuning at the level of standard model , @xmath99    thus fine tuning is one part in @xmath100 , rather than one part in @xmath78 as often quoted , provided we believe that there is no physics beyond standard model .",
    "but we know that there is at least one scale beyond , associated with gravity , namely , the planck scale which would take us back to original fine tuning problem if the planck scale is fundamental . however",
    ", if it is a derived scale similar to the one in randall - sundrum scenario , the fine tuning could considerable reduce .",
    "we thus conclude that the cosmological constant problem _ a la _ fine tuning could not be as severe as it is posed ; it is often over emphasized .",
    "of course the problem still remains to be grave .",
    "+ the coincidence problem or why dark energy density is of the order of matter density today ? is yet more over emphasized . we know",

    "in this case , evolution is independent of initial conditions and the fine tuning associated with @xmath1 may be alleviated .",
    "it is possible to realize tracker solutions in several ways .",
    "however , they are obtained most naturally in models with inverse power law potentials ( @xmath124 ) which approximate the exponential potential for large values of the exponent @xmath125 and for which the slope is variable@xmath0 large at early epochs and small at late times which is precisely the behavior we are looking for .",
    "it is little discouraging that tracker models are less favored observationally compared to thawing models .",
    "+ the slowly rolling scalar field models irrespective of their types are generally faced with another grave problem which surfaces when we allow the scalar field interaction with matter , @xmath126 . in order to appreciate the problem ,",
    "let us estimate the mass of scalar field employing any of the slow roll conditions , @xmath127 and since the mass of the field should be of the order of @xmath128 to be relevant to late time cosmic acceleration , we find by making use of the second slow roll parameter @xmath129 , @xmath130 an important remark related to late time field dynamics is in order . in case ,",
    "@xmath131 , the field would be rolling very fast at the present epoch and hence of no relevance to late time cosmology . on the other hand , if @xmath132 , the field would not be distinguished from cosmological constant .",

    "+ the tiny mass of the field creates problem as one loop correction shifts the mass of the field by a huge amount @xmath133(m is cut off ) unless we tune the coupling @xmath134 appropriately .",
    "since @xmath135 , the required fine tuning brings us back to cosmological constant . since there are no known symmetries at low energies to control the radiative corrections , the purpose of introducing dynamical dark energy this way stands defeated .",
    "let us mention an attempt to construct a string inspired axionic quintessence for which the radiative corrections might be under control@xcite .",
    "however , the scenario belongs to the class of thawing models and thereby faced with the same level of fine tuning as cosmological constant .",
    "+ before we get to the next topic , we would like to comment on the stability of fundamental scalar against radiative corrections .",
    "one might think that the large correction to mass is the artifact of the regularization as dimensional scheme of regularization always involves logarithmic dependence on the cut off.in order to clarify the issue , let us accurately compute the one loop correction to mass of the fundamental scalar , @xmath136 where @xmath137 is the mass of field circulating in the loop and @xmath82 is the cut off on four momentum introduced to compute the divergent integral . it should be noticed that unlike the calculation of vacuum energy , the cut off used here preserves lorentz invariance .",
    "secondly , one often quotes the first term of ( [ i1 ] ) as correction to mass which is quadratic divergent ( as we did above ) when cut off is removed .",
    "let us compute the same using dimensional regularization , @xmath138 we notice that the first terms in both the expressions ( [ i1 ] ) @xmath22 ( [ i2 ] ) are divergent and need to be subtracted ; the remaining logarithmic corrections are essentially same whether we impose simple cut off on four momenta in the divergent integral or we employ the dimensional regularization .",
    "we should emphasize that it is the property of the fundamental scalar that the radiative correction to its mass is proportional to the mass of the field it interacts with .",
    "the dominant contribution comes from the heaviest mass scale in the theory to which the one loop correction is proportional to . in case",
    "there is such a mass scale in the theory , it would destabilize the system as there is no symmetry to protect it at low energies .",
    "this is a generic problem inherent to theories that include a fundamental scalar and it has nothing to do with the regularization scheme we use .",
    "indeed , the same does not happen in electrodynamics where the one loop correction to mass of electron is given by , @xmath139 which is remarkable in a sense that atomic physics can rely on the interaction of electrons and photons and can safely ignore heavier fermions ; their contribution is suppressed by inverse powers of the corresponding heavier mass scales which is radically different from what happens in theory with a fundamental scalar .      in a healthy field theoretic set up ,",
    "the higher mass scales are expected to decouple from low energy physics . according to thooft",
    ", a parameter in the field theory is termed natural if by switching it off in lagrangian at the classical level enhances symmetry of theory which is also respected at the quantum level .",
    "let us immediately note that cosmological constant is not a natural parameter of einstein theory .",
    "indeed , in absence of matter , if we ignore @xmath140 , eintein equations([eqeq ] ) admit minkowsky space time as solution . in this case , the underlying symmetry group , namely , the poincare group has 10 generators similar to the case of de sitter space time that one obtains as solution after invoking cosmological constant in einstein equations .",
    "we therefore conclude that cosmological constant is not a natural parameter of einstein theory .",
    "it is also clear from the above discussion that any field theory that contains a fundamental scalar suffers from the problem of naturalness see ref.@xcitefor details . in these theories",
    "a protection mechanism should be in place .",
    "the recent discovery of higgs boson of mass around 125 gev cries for supersymmetry essential for the consistency of the framework .",
    "clearly , both the cosmological constant and scalar field are faced with problem of similar nature .",
    "let us also emphasize that in field theory formulated in flat space time , vacuum energy can safely be ignored by choosing normal ordering .",
    "it is legitimate as there is no known laboratory experiment to measure the absolute value of energy ; we normally measure the difference such that the vacuum energy gets canceled in the process .",
    "ca nt we then play the following trick to address the cosmological constant problem ?",
    "indeed , the frw metric , is conformally equivalent to minkowsky space time . by a suitable conformal transformation on einstein - hilbert action with cosmological constant",
    ", we can transform to flat space time .",
    "however , in this case , we are left with scalar field non - minimally coupled to matter .",
    "taking into account the fact that particle masses in the einstein frame become field dependent , one can demonstrate that the scalar field in flat space time imbibes full information of frw dynamics .",
    "have we then done away with cosmological constant problem ?",
    "unfortunately , scalar field as we pointed out is plagued with the problem of naturalness thereby one problem translates into another equivalent one .",
    "as mentioned before , the modified theories of gravity at large scales are essentially represented by einstein gravity(gr ) along with the extra degrees of freedom .",
    "for instance , in @xmath3 theories @xcite , we have one scalar degree of freedom @xmath141 dubbed scalaron which is mixed with the curvature in the jordan frame .",
    "we can diagonalize the lagrangian by performing a conformal transformation on @xmath3 action reducing the theory in einstein frame to gr plus a scalar field with a potential uniquely determined through @xmath4 and the first derivative of f(r ) with respect to r. consistency demands that @xmath142 ( absence of ghost ) and@xmath143(absence of tachyonic mode or dolgov- kawasaki instability ) . in einstein frame ,",
    "degrees of freedom become diagonalized but @xmath141 gets directly coupled to matter and the coupling is typically of the order of one . we emphasize that both the frames are not only mathematically equivalent but also describe same physics : the relationship between physical observables is same in both the frames .",
    "the extra degree of freedom @xmath141 should give rise to rise to late time cosmic acceleration thereby telling us that its mass @xmath144 .",
    "however , such a light field directly coupled to matter would grossly violate the local physics where gr is in excellent agreement with observations .",
    "for instance , solar physics would be safe if @xmath145 .",
    "it is an irony that large scale modification interferes with local physics which is related to the fact that gr describes local physics to a very high accuracy .",

    "it is interesting that dimensional reduction of @xmath260 gives rise to lower order galileon lagrangian , @xmath261 , the roll of galileon field is played by the dilaton field . in what follows we briefly out line how this connection between two ghost free theories is established .",
    "+ let us consider five dimensional gravity where einstein - hilbert is supplemented with gauss - bonnet term , @xmath262 which is the simplest form of lovelock theory .",
    "we then use the standard prescription to reduce the action to four dimension and use the following metric ansatz ,    @xmath263    where the scalar field @xmath238 appearing in the metric plays the role of the size of the extra dimensions .",
    "the dimensional reduction assuming the extra dimension to be compact , gives the following action , @xmath264 the last term in the reduced action is the lowest order galileon term @xmath261 .",

    "formulated in flat space time , mass can either be introduced by hand or generated through spontaneous symmetry breaking but general theory of relativity is not formulated as a field theory .",
    "one could naively consider the metric @xmath149 as field and try to introduce mass via the invariants , @xmath266 or @xmath267 which obviously do not serve the purpose .",

    "let us first cast the relativistic equations of spin-0 and spin-1 fields , @xmath271 it is important to note that the condition @xmath272 is in built in the equation of motion and not imposed from outside .",

    "massive vector field has clearly three degrees of freedom .",
    "it is important to notice that this condition can no longer be derived from the equation of motion in the @xmath276 limit which is consistent with the fact that we have gauge invariance in this case which allows us to get rid of two un physical degrees of freedom .",

    "the first condition on @xmath268 is analogous to the case of vector field .",
    "the vanishing of trace of @xmath268 is very specific to linear theory and we will come back to this point later in our discussion .",

    "the pf mass terms corresponds to an intelligent tuning of the coefficient which excludes the ghost from linear theory , we shall come back to this point in the forthcoming discussion .",

    "thus the introduction of mass is effectively equivalent to repulsive effect _ a la _ cosmological constant in the standard lore .",
    "it is broadly clear that cosmological constant gets linked to graviton mass which is altogether a novel perspective .",
    "secondly , one might have a naive feeling that since the mass of graviton is very small , the pauli - fierz theory would not disturb the predictions of gr in the local neighborhood .",
    "the deep scrutiny of the problem reveals that it does not hold and that the predictions pauli - fierz theory in the solar system are at finite difference from gr , hence the theory suffers from discontinuity problem dubbed vdvz discontinuity @xcite . in what follows , we shall outline the problem and expose its underlying cause .      as mentioned before , the field @xmath268 universally couples to any matter source @xmath294 .",
    "if we expand the einstein - hilbert term in presence of a matter lagrangian up to leading order in @xmath268 , we not only reproduce @xmath286 but also obtain the coupling of the field with the source , namely , @xmath295 .",

    "we consider a flat friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric of the form@xcite @xmath407 while for the stckelberg scalars we consider the ansatz @xmath408 in this case the einstein - hilbert action and the action [ actionmass ] become : @xmath409\\\\ \\label{gravitonpart } \\mathcal{s}_{\\rm{mass}}&=3m^2 m_{pl}^2\\int { \\rm d}t a^3\\bigl[n g_1(\\xi)-\\dot f a g_2(\\xi)\\bigr]\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath410\\\\ \\label{g2def } g_2(\\xi ) & = \\xi ( 1-\\xi)\\bigl[1+\\frac{3}{4}\\alpha_3 ( 1-\\xi)+\\alpha_4 ( 1-\\xi)^2\\bigr ] ; \\xi = \\frac{1}{a}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    variation with respect to @xmath411 , setting @xmath412 at the end , leads to the first friedmann equation @xmath413    variation with respect to @xmath414 gives the constraint equation @xmath415    where @xmath416 is a constant of integration .",
    "the constraint equation is problematic as it implies that @xmath417 .",
    "we can invoke spatially non flat geometry and obtain a viable background dynamics .",
    "however , the latter turn out to be unstable under perturbations@xcite .",
    "even if these branches were stable , the absence of spatially flat geometry would mean point towards some underlying problem of @xmath6 .",
    "there are clearly three ways to handle the problem : ( 1 ) we may adhere to the point of view that the mass of graviton is strictly zero and abandon the efforts to look for consistent theory of massive gravity .",
    "( 2 ) perhaps the easiest way out is to modify @xmath6 at the level of cosmology , say by making the mass of graviton a field variable by replacing @xmath418 or by introducing a dilaton field which by itself can not lead to a fundamental idea@xcite .",
    "this is similar to curing a wound from out side without providing an internal therapy .",
    "the bi - metric theories and the models of massive gravity based upon lorentz violations could be a serious option in this category@xcite .",
    "( 3 ) if we adopt a conservative and pragmatic view , we might claim that @xmath6 is a correct theory .",
    "it predicts a generic anisotropy in the universe and points towards the violation of cosmological principle .",
    "the recent investigations on optical polarizations , cmb quadrupole and octopole and the study of radio sources point towards a large scale anisotropy with the preferred axis(see , ref.@xcite and references therein ) .",
    "we may therefore abandon the frw cosmology and opt for an anisotropic background .",
    "( 4 ) the most challenging way out is to modify @xmath6 at the fundamental level .",
    "let us note that bi - gravity theories sound promising with healthy frw cosmology at late times .",
    "unfortunately , the theory runs into difficulties in the early universe@xcite .",
    "in this brief review we presented a broad account of standard lore of cosmic acceleration _ a la _ dark energy and large scale modification of gravity . given the observational constraints and difficulties associated with model building of dynamical dark energy , it would be fair to say that cosmological constant emerges in a stronger position .",
    "there are three distinguished features which make it a celebrity .",
    "first , it is the integral part of einstein gravity and requires no adhoc assumption for its introduction .",
    "in fact , it makes classical einstein gravity complete in four dimensions .",
    "secondly , it provides with the simplest possibility to describe late time cosmic acceleration .",
    "last but not least , it is consistent with all the observations and performs better than models of dynamical dark energy . given the present data which is quite accurate at the background level , we can not distinguish cosmological constant from quintessence or large scale modification ; the needle of hope points towards the cosmological constant as the source of cosmic acceleration . at present",
    ", the cosmology community tacitely agrees that at the background level there is nothing but cosmological constant .",
    "however , one should admit that there are difficult theoretical issues associated with cosmological constant .",
    "its incredibly small value and the absence of a generic symmetry at the associated energy scales to protect it from quantum corrections make the problem most challenging in theoretical physics . + with a hope to alleviate the cosmological constant problem , a variety of scalar field models were introduced .",
    "we have here presented basic features of cosmological dynamics of scalar fields . in our opinion",
    ", scalar field models can not address the said problem .",
    "a fundamental scalar field is plagued with naturalness problem thereby one problem translates into another one of similar nature@xcite .",
    "+ there is a school of thought in cosmology which preaches the necessity of paradigm shift , namely , that large scale modification of gravity might account for late time cosmic acceleration . as we pointed out earlier , the generic modifications amount to extra degrees of freedom expected to complement einstein gravity at large scales .",
    "the tough challenges of these scenarios are related to local physics constraints . in case",
    "the extra degrees are massive , the required accuracy of their screening _ a la chameleon mechanism _ in the local neighborhood leaves no scope for large scale modification to account for late time cosmic acceleration . + as for the massless degrees , they should be represented by galileon field which can implement vainshtein screening .",
    "galileon field appears in the decoupling limit in massive gravity .",
    "we have briefly described the connection of galileon field to their higher dimensional descendent , the lovelock gravity which leaves no surprise for them to be ghost free . however , the fact that they can protect local physics in the decoupling limit is a big bonus for galileons .",
    "there are , however , issues here which need attention .",
    "galileons are legitimate representatives of a profound structure in higher dimensions@xmath0 the lovelock theory .",
    "the linkage of these two systems may be established through dimensional reduction @xmath0 a well defined procedure to establish contact with four dimension we live in .",
    "it is really surprising where galileon field inherit superluminality from .",
    "this feature can not come from lovelock structure , may be it is induced from reduction process !",
    "one should also ponder upon the connection ( if any ) of generalized galileon dubbed hordenski system to higher dimensions .",
    "+  galileon field serves as a fundamental building block for non linear ghost free massive gravity .",
    "interestingly , kicking out ghost from the theory brings in superluminality , an inherent feature of galileons .",
    "even if we close our eyes on causality issues , the ghost free massive gravity _ a la _ @xmath6 miserably fails in cosmology it was meant for . in our opinion , adding yet new degree to the set up , such as a dilaton , at cosmology level defeats the original motivation of the theory . in our description of massive gravity",
    ", we avoided technical issues and often resorted to heuristical arguments based upon physical perceptions . and",
    "this is consistent with the motivation of the review to convey the basic ideas of the theme under consideration to a wider audience .",
    "+ there is a beautiful field theoretic framework in the background of the non linear ghost free massive gravity and we believe that such a beauty can not go for waist .",
    "we believe that some fundamental idea would resolve the underlying difficulty , may be , something similar to the higgs mechanism that salvaged the standard model of particle physics .",
    "+ on the observational front , we expect to distinguish between einstein gravity(with cosmological constant ) and modified schemes ( f(r ) , dgp etc ) in future surveys . on theoretical grounds ,",
    "the former emerges cleaner than any large scale modification . as for the modified theories , despite inherent difficulties , non linear massive gravity deserves attention due to its generic features .",
    "it links cosmological constant to the mass of a fundamental particle , the graviton and provides with some mechanism of degravitaion . at present",
    ", we do not know a consistent model of large scale modification of gravity .",
    "in such situation one might opt for an effective description containing a single scalar field of most general nature non - minimally coupled to matter .",
    "we believe that future surveys of large scale structure would reveal if there is physics beyond @xmath1cdm .",
    "+ clearly , the phenomenon of late time cosmic acceleration is far from being understood .",
    "this is certainly the puzzle of the millennium and it is therefore not surprising that there is no easy solution to this problem .",
    "observational missions are in full swing in cosmology at present and there is no doubt that interesting times are ahead for theoreticians as well as for observers .",
