    ", it is apparent that the magnitude of the pairing correlations are relatively weak both in the limit of strong inhomogeneity ( @xmath105 ) and of vanishing inhomogeneity ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "however , the strength of these correlations is only weakly dependent on @xmath54 for a broad range of intermediate values .",

    "( [ sma ] ) , @xmath110 times this quantity is the single - mode - approximation to the superconducting susceptibility.,width=294 ]    it is more difficult to make a clear qualitative statement about the behavior of the striped model .",
    "one seemingly puzzling feature of the striped results deserves comment . in the limit @xmath111",
    ", where the two ladders decouple , one might expect the correlation of the inter - ladder pair fields [ @xmath101 ] to vanish .",
    "however , since for @xmath113 , the pair binding energy on a @xmath92 ladder ( cube ) is positive , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cell_pbe ] ( dashed curve ) , for @xmath114 and @xmath115 , there are two degenerate ground states , with the hole - pair on one or the other disconnected ladder .",
    "thus , even as @xmath26 tends to 0 , the ground - state wave function is a coherent superposition of these two states , and hence has substantial pair - field correlations .",
    "were one to study the finite temperature properties of this system , the coherence would be lost above a relatively small temperature @xmath116 .",
    "this illustrates the dangers of uncritically accepting evidence of strong superconducting correlations from the pair - field correlation function .",
    "we have also studied the expectation value of the pair - field operator between ground - states with @xmath69 and @xmath117 doped holes : _ ij m;0 | _ ij | m-2;0 [ avdelta ] where @xmath118 is the ground state with @xmath58 doped holes .",
    "this is not a gauge invariant quantity , in that there is an arbitrary choice of an overall phase ; by choosing the wave functions real , this is reduced to an overall sign ambiguity .",
    "however , the internal symmetry of the pairing state is manifest in this quantity .    for the checkerboard case , for all @xmath3 and @xmath119 , the ground state symmetry as a function of @xmath58 alternates , @xmath120 for @xmath98 , @xmath121 for @xmath115 , @xmath120 for @xmath122 .",
    "thus , the pair - field operator that connects any two of these states must have precisely @xmath121 ( _ i.e. _ @xmath36 ) symmetry@xcite . in fig .",

    "again , there is a clear indication that superconducting correlations are strongest for @xmath34 .",
    "two peculiarities are worth mentioning here : firstly , it is puzzling that the difference in the pair amplitudes on the weak and strong bonds is so large , @xmath128 , as clearly shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : cc_sq ] . this is a qualitative point that warrants further study . secondly , even in the limit @xmath129 , @xmath130",
    "this is a consequence of the fact the ground - state is three - fold degenerate@xcite when @xmath131 and @xmath115 ; this degeneracy is lifted whenever @xmath132 .",
    "the @xmath133 superconducting susceptibility is expressible as _ a ( ) = _ where @xmath134 is the energy of the @xmath135th excited state with @xmath58 doped holes , and where we take ^(a ) 1 z_a _",

    "because of the d - wave symmetry , we always take @xmath138 to be positive on vertical bonds and negative on horizontal bonds .",
    "we consider three possible susceptibilities : @xmath139 in which where , @xmath140 on the strong bonds and 0 on the weak , @xmath141 in which @xmath140 on the weak bonds and 0 on the strong , and @xmath142 in which @xmath140 on all nearest - neighbor bonds . for simplicity , we have defined the susceptibility with respect to adding two - holes .",
    "another ( more conventional ) definition includes , as well , terms which remove two holes .",
    ".,width=294 ]    as mentioned before , computing all the excited states that enter this sum is not feasible , but a lower bound estimate can be readily obtained in the `` single mode approximation '' , by approximating the sum by the single term involving the ground state with @xmath143 electrons .",

    "moreover , it is worth mentioning that they are almost exact to the lower bound susceptibility as long as @xmath147 by tuning chemical potential properly .",
    "we now discuss the implications of our results . in particular , we are interested in using the present information to infer , as much as possible , the phase diagram of the checkerboard and striped hubbard models in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath63 .",
    "the results of our analysis and some additional speculations lead us to propose the qualitative phase diagram shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_cb ] .",
    "there are two limits in which the checkerboard model simplifies : @xmath148 , where it can be studied using conventional diagramatic methods , and @xmath149 , where it reduces to weakly coupled squares which can be treated@xcite using degenerate perturbation theory in @xmath54 .",
    "this allows us to deduce the solid portions shown in the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_cb ] without resorting to the present numerical results .    for @xmath150 , and in the thermodynamic limit",
    ", the non - interacting fermi - surface depends qualitatively on @xmath54 .",
    "there are four bands since each unit cell contains four sites and @xmath151 and @xmath152 are the basis vectors of the reciprocal lattice . for @xmath153 , there are two electron pockets enclosing the @xmath58 points @xmath154 and @xmath155 respectively , and one hole pocket , enclosing the `` nodal point '' @xmath156 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fermisurface](a ) .",
    "the hole pocket shrinks to a point as @xmath26 approaches the critical value for a lifshitz transition , @xmath157 . for @xmath158 ,",

    "[ fig : pd_cb ] as the boundary between two fermi liquid phases - fl1 ( with two electron pockets plus one hole pocket ) and fl2 ( with only two electron pockets ) . in sketching this figure ,",
    "we have assumed that the fermi liquid phases are stable in the presence of a small repulsive @xmath3 ; it is likely that this is not strictly the case , since there is probably a kohn - luttinger instability of any fermi liquid  @xcite , but if this occurs , it is on such a low energy and temperature scale that it can be neglected for present purposes .     for ( a ) @xmath163 , showing the two electron and one hole fermi pockets , and ( b ) @xmath164 , with only the two electron pockets . , width=294 ]    the small @xmath26 portion of the phase diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_cb ] was derived previously in refs .   and .",
    "for @xmath165 , where an isolated hubbard square has a positive pair - binding energy , there exists a nodeless d@xmath166-wave superconducting phase . for @xmath167 , there is a third fermi liquid phase , fl3 , which has the same fermi surface topology as fl2 .",
    "finally , for @xmath168 ( where the isolated square with one doped hole has a fully polarized spin 3/2 ground state ) , the system exhibits an exotic , spin 3/2 fermi liquid phase , fl4 , if @xmath169 , while it phase separates into two insulating antiferromagnetic charge ordered phases if @xmath170 .",
    "the superconducting state at small @xmath26 arises from the geometry of the square and the strong correlations produced by @xmath3 .",
    "however , across the phase boundary between the superconducting phase and fl2 or fl3 , it is reasonable to view the onset of superconductivity as a bcs - like fermi surface instability . in this limit , the fact that the d - wave superconductor is nodeless can be understood as being a simple consequence of the fact that the fermi surface does not intersect the line of d - wave gap nodes , so there are no gapless quasiparticles .",
    "to obtain a more complete phase diagram , we have used the insights obtained from the present exact diagonalization studies .",
    "it is , of course , not clear to what extent the results from small system studies can be extrapolated to the @xmath63 limit .",
    "however , at least in the case of the pair - binding energy , since the results appear to be relatively insensitive to boundary conditions for @xmath171 , we feel that we can use these results as the basis of a set of plausible conjectures .",
    "these are shown as the dashed lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : pd_cb ] .",
    "notice that we have superposed the conjectured phase diagram on the contour plot of the pair - binding energy from fig .",
    "[ fig : contour_pbe](a ) .",
    "where the pair - binding energy on the 4 @xmath23 4 system is large and insensitive to boundary conditions , we feel that we are on sound grounds when we speculate that this corresponds to a well developed , nodeless d - wave superconducting state in the @xmath68 limit .",
    "unfortunately , where @xmath65 is small and/or sensitive to boundary conditions , this could mean that in the @xmath63 limit , the system has entered a gapless phase , _",
    "i.e. _ a fl or a nodal d - wave superconductor .",
    "however , it could simply mean that the minimum gap of a nodeless d - wave superconductor is small and the corresponding correlation length is long .",
    "in drawing our conjectural phase diagram , we have assumed the former , and so , to the extent possible , we have drawn phase boundaries between the nodeless d - wave phase and various gapless phases along contours separating the region of `` large '' and boundary condition insensitive pair - binding energy , to regions with smaller , and/or strongly boundary condition dependent pair - binding . clearly , the upper portion of the phase diagram ( @xmath172 ) is the most speculative portion , including the entire region in which nodal d - wave superconductivity occurs .    the existence of a tetracritical point in the conjectured phase diagram , with the additional implication that there exists a nodal d - wave superconducting state for large enough @xmath26 , follows from the nature of the known phases along the edges of the phase diagram .",
    "in particular , if there is a direct , continuous transition from fl1 to a d - wave superconductor , the d - wave superconductor must be nodal .",
    "however , we can not rule out the possibility of a direct first order transition from fl1 to a d - wave superconductor , in which case the tetracritical point could be replaced by a bicritical point , and the d - wave superconductor could always be nodeless .",
    "the portion of the phase diagram with @xmath173 could also exhibit additional broken symmetry phases  @xcite .",
    "it is impossible , with any degree of confidence , to use the present results to infer anything new about the phase diagram of the striped hubbard model in the @xmath63 limit . for @xmath174 ,",
    "the model becomes an array of weakly connected two - leg ladders , a problem which was studied previously by e. arrigoni _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "from that work , we know that for @xmath175 , there exists a nodeless `` d - wave like '' superconducting state over a very broad range of @xmath53 .",
    "in contrast , the oscillatory behavior of the pair - binding energy seen in the fig .  [",
    "fig : contour_pbe](c ) as @xmath176 is a special feature of the a @xmath92 ladder , which does not occur in a system of weakly coupled , infinitely - long two - leg ladders . combining this observation with the strong boundary condition dependence of the pair - binding energy apparent in fig .",
    "[ fig : pbenergy](b ) ( even when the twist in the boundary conditions is applied in the direction perpendicular to the stripe direction ) , we are forced to conclude that the results on the 4 @xmath23 4 stripe lattice are not representative of the @xmath63 limit .",
    "we therefore do not venture to draw even a conjectural phase diagram for this system .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis of the fact that , in fig .  [ fig : contour_pbe](c ) , there is an extended region with relatively large pair - binding energy when @xmath2 is a substantial fraction of @xmath1 , makes plausible the speculation made in ref .   that the nodeless superconducting state grows in strength for a substantial range of non - infinitessimal @xmath54 .",
    "furthermore , if indeed there is a nodal d - wave state for @xmath54 near 1 , there must also exist a lifshitz - type phase transition to a superconducting state with gapless quasi - particles at a @xmath53 dependent critical value of the inter - ladder coupling @xcite .",
    "one issue that is often ignored in discussions of htc is the role of the longer - range coulomb interactions .",
    "d - wave pairing avoids the obvious deliterious effects of the on - site hubbard repulsion between electrons , but is known@xcite to be fairly sensitive to longer range repulsive interactions . to address this issue ,",
    "we have computed the effect on the pair - binding energy of a nearest - neighbor repulsion , @xmath177 , between electrons .",
    "indeed , we always find that the pair - binding energy decreases , more or less linearly , with increasing @xmath177 .",
    "however , where the pair - binding is strong for @xmath178 , it remains positive up to rather large values of @xmath177 .",
    "for instance , for the checkerboard lattice under optimal conditions , @xmath7 and @xmath179 , @xmath65 is an essentially linear function of @xmath177 which vanishes at @xmath180 .    in conclusion",
    ", we have studied inhomogeneous hubbard models , primarily with checkerboard and striped patterns , on a @xmath0 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions by exact diagonalization .",
    "although the existence of the htc in the uniform hubbard model is still a controversial issue @xcite , we have produced clear evidence that , without considering other non - electronic degrees of freedom such as phonons , strong pairing of electrons can be achieved from purely repulsive interactions if certain modulations of the electronic structure are introduced .",
    "non - monotonic dependence of the pair - binding energy and the pair - field pair - field correlators on the degree of inhomogeneity ( @xmath181 ) were found to be generic .",
    "this observation supports the notion that there is an optimal inhomogeneity for high temperature superconductivity  @xcite . since exact diagonalizaiton studies can not access significantly larger systems , it has not been possible to carry out finite size scaling to corroborate this conclusion .",

    "<S> we report the results of exact diagonalization studies of hubbard models on a @xmath0 square lattice with periodic boundary conditions and various degrees and patterns of inhomogeneity , which are represented by inequivalent hopping integrals @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we focus primarily on two patterns , the checkerboard and the striped cases , for a large range of values of the on - site repulsion @xmath3 and doped hole concentration , @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we present evidence that superconductivity is strongest for @xmath3 of order the bandwidth , and intermediate inhomogeneity , @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> the maximum value of the `` pair - binding energy '' we have found with purely repulsive interactions is @xmath6 for the checkerboard hubbard model with @xmath7 and @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , for near optimal values , our results are insensitive to changes in boundary conditions , suggesting that the correlation length is sufficiently short that finite size effects are already unimportant .    the relatively large energy scales and short coherence lengths involved in high temperature superconductivity ( htc ) imply that theories of the `` mechanism '' must involve different considerations than the conventional bcs theory of low temperature superconductivity ( ltc ) . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of ltc can be treated in the context of fermi liquid theory , in which the strong effects of electron - electron repulsions are resolved at high energy , so that pairing is a fermi surface instability triggered by weak , retarded , induced attractive interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the theory of htc must treat the strong local repulsions between electrons directly , as fermi liquid theory is certainly not valid at short distances and high energies . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , since the physics of htc is relatively local , numerical studies of finite size systems can , plausibly , resolve questions concerning the mechanism so long as the system sizes are large compared to the coherence length , a condition that could not remotely be envisaged for ltc .    in the present paper , </S>",
    "<S> we report exact diagonalization studies of the low energy states of the hubbard model on a square lattice ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice ] ) , with hopping matrix elements , @xmath9 , between pairs of sites , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , and with a short - range repulsive interaction , @xmath12 , between two electrons on the same site . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to address the following sharply posed question , related to the physics of the mechanism : what form of the hamiltonian ( _ i.e. _ values of @xmath13 and @xmath14 ) maximizes @xmath15 subject to the constraints that 1 ) @xmath9 is short - ranged and bounded , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 for all @xmath17 , and that 2 ) the interactions are repulsive , @xmath18 for all  @xmath10 ? </S>",
    "<S> constraint 2 represents a theoretical prejudice that htc derives directly from the strong repulsive interactions between electrons , and could be relaxed in future studies . </S>",
    "<S> the requirement that @xmath9 is bounded avoids the trivial answer that , for any hamiltonian that supports superconductivity , @xmath15 can be doubled by simply doubling the hamiltonian .     on the solid `` strong '' bonds and @xmath19 on the dotted `` weak '' bonds . </S>",
    "<S> the three labeled bonds , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are the focus of our study of pairing correlations.,width=249 ]    the largest systems we can readily study are 4 @xmath23 4 . for such small systems , there is no direct way to extract a @xmath15 . </S>",
    "<S> we have thus introduced other benchmarks of the strength of the superconductivity that can be readily computed on finite size systems , especially the `` pair binding energy , '' defined in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig : pbenergy ] ) , and the strength of the pair - field correlations defined in eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ dij])-([avdelta ] ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the full optimization problem we have proposed would be prohibitively time consuming . </S>",
    "<S> we have therefore concentrated on a restricted , highly symmetric subset of all possible hamiltonians , with particular focus on the symmetric checkerboard and stripe patterns shown in figs .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lattice](a ) and [ fig : lattice](b ) . </S>",
    "<S> we take the hopping matrix elements to be @xmath1 on the solid ( `` strong '' ) bonds in the figure , and @xmath19 on the dotted ( `` weak '' ) bonds . for @xmath24 , </S>",
    "<S> the system is the homogeneous hubbard model , while for @xmath25 , the system consists of disconnected hubbard squares or ladders . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as we vary @xmath26 from 0 to @xmath1 , we vary the `` degree of inhomogeneity '' .    for instance , as shown in the contour plot in fig .  [ fig : contour_pbe ] , the pair - binding energy of the checkerboard lattice with periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) is largest for @xmath7 and @xmath27 . the concentration , @xmath4 , of `` doped holes '' per site ( _ i.e. _ the deviation from one electron per site ) can only take discrete values ; among those , the optimal pair - binding is largest when @xmath28 ( as in the contour plot in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : contour_pbe](a ) ) , somewhat smaller when @xmath29 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : contour_pbe](b ) ) , and is always negative ( pair - repulsion ) for @xmath30 . indeed , of all forms of the hamiltonian we have explored to date </S>",
    "<S> , the checkerboard hubbard model with these parameters has the largest pair - binding energy we have found . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by changing boundary conditions to twisted pbc , shown as the solid ( red ) triangles in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : pbenergy](a ) , we see that at fixed @xmath7 , as a function of @xmath26 in the range @xmath31 , the results are sensitive to change of boundary conditions only at the 20% level .    </S>",
    "<S> we therefore infer that , _ the checkerboard hubbard model in the thermodynamic limit , has a maximum value of the pair - binding @xmath32 for @xmath33 , @xmath34 , and @xmath35 . _ from analysis of the ground - state symmetry and of the pair - field correlations , we can identify the dominant superconducting correlations on this system as d - wave ( @xmath36 ) . </S>"
