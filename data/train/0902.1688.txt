    "the implementation of the instruments dedicated to the coherent beam combination for stellar interferometry involves very complex optical setups .",
    "existing interferometric facilities that are available for astronomical observations deliver coherent beams coming from up to 8 telescopes . a limiting factor for the combination of all available beams of a given interferometer",
    "is this complexity and the induced high stability requirement .",
    "using fiber optics and integrated optics devices one can address part of this concern @xcite and efficient implementations on several instruments already provide noteworthy astrophysical results @xcite .",
    "major interferometric facilities , like the european very large telescope interferometer ( vlti - cerro paranal - chile ) ( 4x8  m telescopes and 4x1.8 m telescopes ) or chara in mt wilson - california ( 6x1 m telescopes ) are currently operating instruments that make usage of photonics components and consider for their next generation instruments more complex photonics devices .    while we demonstrated in the past the efficiency of photonics devices for multi beam combination in single mode interferometry @xcite",
    ", we show here how its association with the concept of stationary - wave integrated fourier transform spectrometer ( swifts hereafter ) @xcite allows us to consider a fully integrated instrument , including coherent beam combination , spectrometry and detection implemented on a single photonics device .",
    "the association of swifts evanescent detection principle and photonics beam combination brings a great potential for a fully integrated beam combiner instrument .",
    "section [ sec : techn ] reminds the reader that the state of the art of the considered technologies as well as the main requirements for an interferometric beam combining instrument . according to the purposes of the considered instrument some specific requirements",
    "must be emphasized : high precision measurement of the fringe contrast , accurate phase measurements , spectral resolution capabilities , high dynamic capability on the photometric signal for the detection of faint object in the vicinity of bright stars , high imagery reconstruction capability using the largest number of telescopes , highest sensitivity to achieve observations on the fainter objects . in this section",
    "we remind the reader also of the principle of the swifts concept .",
    "section [ sec : swifts ] describes several possible implementations of fully integrated instruments .",
    "we address for each proposed concept its adequacy the purposes of some specific instruments .",
    "we show that using existing built - in blocks , the requirements for the interferometric instrumentation can be met using a single integrated instrument .",
    "the requirements of an interferometric instrument must be adapted according to its main purposes .",
    "an interferometric fringe pattern has two meaningful observables , its contrast , or depth of modulation and its phase or location of the central fringe .    *",
    "high precision contrast * measurement is required to perform an accurate reconstruction from the measured fringes , using the appropriate fourier transform .",
    "many instrumental biases strongly affect the fringe patterns and drastically increase the error on the reconstructed signal .    *",
    "an accurate phase determination * is required for both astrometric applications , and to ensure an efficient detection of the signal , while it is strongly affected by the instrumental effects and the transmission through the atmosphere .",
    "the * fringe tracker * instrumental mode intends to ensure close loop operation and lock the fringe position on the detector ( equivalent to adaptive optics module for single dish operation ) .",
    "the * coherencing mode * dedicated to open loop operation returns the position of the whole fringe packet when the guiding star is too faint to achieve a sufficient signal to noise ratio ( snr hereafter ) to operate in close loop . in both modes",
    "the smallest number of pixels is required in order to optimize fastest operation on faintest sources .",
    "an accurate sampling of the fringe pattern must be done , using a sufficiently long coherence length in order to catch a shifted fringe packet .",
    "the required coherence length allows the instrument to deal with disturbing effects that induce phase jumps and fringe smearing , and with contrast losses due to longitudinal chromatism . + a fringe tracker",
    "is operated with short exposures able to drive the servo - loop at the required speed ( mainly given by atmospheric characteristic time @xmath1 , down to few millisecond ) .",
    "coherencing mode may be operated at longer exposures time .",
    "the ultimate performances in both cases are achieved thanks to photo - counting detection that is able to deal with various temporal requirements of the incoming signal .",
    "* spectral resolution * capability is mandatory for astrophysical investigations and to provide the appropriate sampling of the foreseen spectral lines . up to @xmath2 resolutions",
    "are considered in current operated instruments @xcite .",
    "a trade off must be done between the spectral resolution and the limiting magnitude for a given observation .",
    "* higher complexity imagery reconstruction * is ensured thanks to a larger number of baselines , for instance with a larger number of telescopes . in that case",
    "the beam combining instrument must deal with the corresponding number of beams , leading to rather complex instruments.image reconstruction needs require also in this case to increase the number of combined telescopes and of coded baselines .    *",
    "low flux sensitivity * is required for the observation of the faintest objects .",
    "it can be achieved thanks to long exposure acquisition . in this case ,",
    "an associated fringe tracker is mandatory to prevent from any fringe blurring during the exposure .",
    "however the faintest sources will be distinguishable using detectors limited by the photon noise . in that case",
    "individual long exposures are no longer required .    *",
    "high photometric dynamic * intends to provide the detection and the analysis of faint structures in the vicinity of a bright sources ( extra solar planets , surrounding disks ) .",
    "the detection of exo - earths requires at least a @xmath3 flux dynamic .",
    "the higher dynamic will be achieved using photon - counting detectors limited by their photo counting rate .",
    "devoted designs must be chosen , according to the foreseen astrophysical science cases , but all of these specifications can not be met with a single instrument .",
    "integrated optics ( hereafter io ) developed for telecom applications is available in the @xmath4 spectral range using various technologies .",
    "it provides very convenient toolbox is then available with suitable performances for its application to astronomical interferometry .",
    "a first review of io capabilities applied to astronomical interferometry has been proposed ten years ago @xcite .",
    "the most interesting capability of this technology is to integrate on a single tiny chip a few centimeters long an instrument with several optical functions made of complex optical circuitry .",
    "it yields very compact instruments , and brings high instrument reliability , with a low sensitivity to external constraints such as vibrations and temperature fluctuations .",
    "the intrinsic stability of an integrated instrument induces excellent phase behaviors .",
    "integration and maintenance operations are highly simplified , while as soon as the fiber optics connection is properly managed the main part of the instrument is self aligned .",
    "many convenient optical functions can be implemented on the same chip , like light deflection , beam separation and coherent combination , modulation , light dispersion @xcite .",
    "furthermore , several coherent beam combination schemes are made available using single mode io , including new schemes that are not provided by conventional bulk optics means .",
    "a description of the possible single mode io beam combining schemes with their corresponding efficiency in terms of snr have been proposed as a guideline for the designs of optimized components dedicated to on - going instrumental programs @xcite .",
    "the three main schemes that have been considered and tested are multi - axial scheme ( all in one combination ) using spatial coding on the detector , co - axial one ( pair wise combinations ) using temporal coding thanks to a modulation of the optical path difference , and a so - called co - axial abcd concept ( pair - wise combination ) which provides a built - in phase coding on four outputs of the component .",
    "an important behavior of io components is its filtering capability while operating in single mode conditions .",
    "it allows a significant improvement of the interferometer precision , thanks to a reduction of the error on the contrast measurement @xcite .",
    "however it must be noticed that single mode operation limits the field of view of the interferometer to compact object observation .",
    "the field of view is limited to the diffraction pattern of the individual telescopes of the interferometric array , while the resolution of the reconstructed image is given by the length of its largest baseline .",
    "the io potential have been demontrated thanks to on - sky exploitation leading to astrophysical results using the iota interferometer ( mt hopkins - arizona ) @xcite and the vlti .",
    "further in progress developments consider the use of complex io components as vsi ( vlti spectro imager ) @xcite and gravity @xcite for the second generation instrument of the vlti . for space borne applications ,",
    "if the compactness is a trivial advantage , with a direct impact on the payload of the instrument , one may mention also the strong advantages of such integrated instrument . during the integration phases the constrains",
    "applied to the integration and alignment procedures is significantly reduced .",
    "most of the efforts are reported during the design phase .",
    "it reduces the unreliability for the duration of these integration phases .",
    "an important drawback of single mode io so far , is the limitation of the field of view to the diffraction airy disk of the individual telescopes .",
    "it must be also pointed out that available io technology limits its application to near ir single mode instrument ( up to @xmath5 ) , even if some fruitful technological developments for the manufacturing of io components working at longer wavelengths provide already fruitful results . related r&d developments are in progress driven by nasa and esa for the preparation of the space mission dedicated to the observation of earth like planets @xcite that requires an operation in the @xmath6 spectral range .      [ cols=\"^ \" , ]     for this setup ( see fig . [",
    "fig : swifts - abcd ] ) we propose a modified design of an existing chip dedicated to the combination of the beams coming from 4 telescopes in matrix mode in the near infrared @xcite . in this design",
    "the optical layout provides on its outputs a set of 4 phases status without any temporal modulation , which allows the proper sampling of the interference pattern .",
    "the sampling of all available baselines lead to a 24 output chip .    for all output guides ,",
    "we propose to implement an enlarged waveguide zone ended by a slightly tilted integrated mirror .",
    "this mirror induces tilted standing waves in the enlarged zone where a set of nano - wires picks up the evanescent field above the wave - guides .",
    "an ir focal plane array ( fpa hereafter ) is mounted beneath this enlarged zone performing the detection of the swifts - lippmann fringes able to measure the output spectrum at each channel output .",
    "the fpa pixel lines are located in coincidence with the wire arrangement .",
    "the resulting standing waves in the near ir ( @xmath7 ) present a wavelength of 500 nm , leading to an undersampling using @xmath8 pixels .",
    "the proper sampling will be performed as soon as the enlarged guide width is sampled by 74 pixels , as each pixel line is surrounding 37 fringes .",
    "this configuration is well - suited for high spectral resolutions since this one is given by the length of the enlarged zone surrounded by the fpa .",
    "for example an hawaii2 fpa with a line of @xmath9 pixel provides a spectral resolution of r=40  000 at @xmath10 ( e.g. 0.04 nm ) . among the proposed concepts in this paper ,",
    "it is certainly the cleanest one while it provides an accurate measurement over all the baselines with an identical number of samples .",

    "+ the upper part shows the swifts - gabor pattern ( holographic pattern ) in the planar waveguide fed by 8 incoming waveguides .",
    "+ the lower part corresponds to its fourier transform , giving the power spectra along all available baselines .",
    "+ the middle part corresponds to the monochromatic case ( c , d ) , while the right and left part corresponds to three chromatic bands ( 150 nm wide ) covering the visible domain that illustrates the chromatic behavior of the component(a , b , e , f ) . + one baseline ( 2 inputs ) built up a fringe pattern that corresponds in the fourier plane to a set of two fringe peaks in the monochromatic case ( shown by the green arrow of the figure ) or two symmetrical spectra in the polychromatic case .",

    "it has been demonstrated @xcite that a set of nano wires properly designed is able to extract up to @xmath11 of the incoming signal for an optimized setup .",
    "a fpa mounted in front of these wires is able to detect half part of the diffused light , leading to a @xmath12 efficiency . in a near future",
    "one can consider to use a close to noiseless ir detector @xcite , bounded on the above described near ir io beam combiner . under conservative assumptions",
    "one may consider that the foreseen io combining component present an efficiency of @xmath13 . considering a resolution of 40  000 over 4 outputs with an exposure time up to @xmath14 , using a snr of 10",
    ", such an instrument will be able to attain a theoretical stellar magnitude @xmath15 .",
    "a similar development for spectroscopy purposes in an other spectral range , using an arrangement of parallel straight waveguides is currently under progress by the authors funded by a fui program of the french government ( see acknowledgments ) .",

    "this io component is directly mounted on a fpa , with a pixel corresponding to each diffusing dot.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    the concept ( see fig . [",
    "fig : swifts - extd ] ) is based on an extension of the swifts - gabor principle where the standing waves resulting from a large number of inputs are managed in a planar waveguide .",
    "it provides sophisticated signal coding , using a simple implementation .",
    "the data processing requires a complex appropriate fourier treatment .",
    "a planar waveguide is fed by all incoming beams ( 8 in the case of fig .",
    "[ fig : swifts - extd - model ] ) , brought thanks to single mode waveguides all around the beam combining zone .",
    "the arrangement of the inputs all around the circle , must not introduce common bisections to avoid any signal overlapping in the resulting fourier inversion ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : swifts - extd - model ] ) .",
    "for instance a regular disposition of the input guides would produce a fringe pattern with equivalent coding frequencies for all baselines , and their contributions would not be distinguishable .",
    "a tapered zone is implemented at the interface of each incoming wave - guide , in order to manage the diffraction effects within the planar wave - guide and to generate a pure plane wavefront and to ensure proper use of fourier inversion . for the case of spherical wavefront",
    ", the inversion law must be obtained using an interaction matrix calibration .",
    "it must be noticed that this setup can be operated with all or part of the 8 inputs .",
    "for instance , if some of the telescopes are not available , the instrument can be still operated with induced losses of performances related to the missing flux from the corresponding telescopes .",
    "a matrix of nano - dots spread out the light from the resulting swifts - gabor fringes , collected by the pixels of a near ir fpa bounded at the waveguide surface ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : swifts - extd ] ) .",
    "the pixel pitch of available fpa ( around 20 @xmath16 for near ir hgcdte detectors ) induces an under - sampling condition while the fringe width inside the waveguide material is almost 500  nm at @xmath17 . to ensure proper complete sampling of the swifts - gabor pattern it is considered either to modulate the optical path difference for all baselines , or to take benefit of the high redundancy available in the resulting interferometric pattern .",
    "the efficiency performances of this setup will be given by the performances of the associated fpa .",
    "this last concept illustrates the level of integration that can be achieved using swifts principle .",
    "one difficulty to implement this concept resides in the bounding process between a planar waveguide and a regular fpa through a nano - dot matrix .",
    "this concern is currently addressed through the above mentioned r&d program .",
    "the performance evaluation of a setup based on this concept requires further analysis , but it can be expected that it should be more efficient than the previous one , since it requires simpler optical circuitry and take benefit from the same detection process .    another concern is the processing of the interferometric signal to reconstruct the observed images .",
    "related signal processing developments to address this issue are starting at laog .",
