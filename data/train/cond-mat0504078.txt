    "the coupling of a one - dimensional metal to an elastic lattice results in an instability towards a lattice distortion known as peierls transition @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon can be observed in various quasi - one - dimensional materials , e.g.  conjugated polymers @xcite like polyacetylene , charge - transfer salts @xcite , or spin - peierls compounds like @xmath3 .    from a theoretical point of view , a first step towards a quantitative description of the peierls transition has been made by su , schrieffer and heeger ( ssh ) @xcite .",
    "however , in their model neither the dynamics of the lattice nor the electron - electron interaction has been taken into account .",
    "subsequently there has been made some effort to include phonons beyond the adiabatic approximation . while in the approach of ssh",
    "the peierls transition occurs for any nonzero value of the electron - phonon ( el - ph ) coupling , a minimum strength of the el - ph coupling is required for the transition if quantum phonons are included @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we consider the limit of a static lattice and focus on the role of the electron - electron interaction .",
    "correlation effects on the peierls transition have been studied using a variety of methods including variational wave - functions @xcite , hartree fock plus perturbation theory @xcite , quantum monte carlo @xcite , numerical diagonalization of small systems @xcite , bosonization @xcite , and incremental expansion @xcite .",
    "it is now generally accepted that for small values of the el - ph coupling constant @xmath4 the dimerization is enhanced when the hubbard interaction @xmath1 is switched on while for @xmath5 it is suppressed .",
    "estimates for the critical el - ph coupling that have been obtained in the literature are @xmath6 in @xcite , @xmath7 in @xcite and @xmath8 in @xcite . for @xmath0 not too close to @xmath9 the dimerization reaches a maximum at @xmath1 of the order of the bandwidth and goes to zero for @xmath10 .",
    "apart from this qualitative agreement there is still a lack of rigorous results , in particular in the limit of weak el - ph coupling @xmath11 which is difficult to address in the aforementioned approaches . in order to remove this uncertainties we study the peierls - hubbard model in the weak coupling regime using second order perturbation theory with respect to the hubbard interaction",
    "this allows use to derive rigorous results in the limit @xmath12 for all values of the el - ph coupling .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section two we introduce the peierls - hubbard model and discuss the validity of the perturbative approach .",
    "the main results concerning the peierls transition are presented in section three . in section four",
    "we discuss our results and compare them with different approaches .",
    "we consider the one - dimensional peierls - hubbard model @xmath13 where @xmath14 creates ( annihilates ) an electron with spin @xmath15 on a lattice of @xmath16 sites , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 is the deviation of the @xmath19th atom from its equilibrium position in units of the lattice constant @xmath20 . @xmath1 and @xmath21 are the on - site hubbard interaction and the elastic constant of the lattice , respectively , and @xmath22 is the hopping parameter . in ( [ hamilt ] )",
    "the phonons are treated in the adiabatic limit which is formally obtained by letting the mass of the atoms go to infinity .",
    "since the lattice distortion is assumed small compared to the lattice constant , the modification of the hopping amplitude can be treated in linear order via the parameter @xmath23 . in the following",
    "we restrict ourselves to half filling where due to @xmath24 the peierls instability leads to an alternating lattice distortion @xmath25 it is convenient to express the el - ph coupling and the dimerization amplitude by the dimensionless parameters @xmath0 and @xmath26 , respectively , which are defined by @xmath27 in terms of these parameters hamiltonian ( [ hamilt ] ) reads @xmath28 we consider @xmath22 , @xmath1 and @xmath0 as given model parameters while the dimerization @xmath26 is free to adjust itself such that the total energy is minimal . in the following",
    "we measure all energies in units of the hopping amplitude @xmath22 ( i.e.  we set @xmath29 ) .",
    "the ground state energy of the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt1 ] ) can only be calculated analytically in the limiting cases @xmath30 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "@xmath30 corresponds to the ordinary hubbard model which has been solved using bethe ansatz @xcite and for @xmath31 the system is completely dimerized .",
    "for other values of @xmath26 one has to resort to approximations or to numerical methods .",
    "since we are only interested in the weak coupling regime we use second order perturbation theory with respect to the hubbard interaction .",
    "first of all we want to justify the assertion that perturbation theory can indeed be applied for the model ( [ hamilt1 ] ) . in the case @xmath30 the exact ground state energy known from the bethe ansatz solution @xcite can be expressed as an integral over bessel functions . as pointed out by economou and poulopoulos @xcite",
    "this integral can be converted into an asymptotic series in @xmath1 .",
    "metzner and vollhardt @xcite showed that the exact second order term of this asymptotic expansion can be calculated using perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , they conjectured that this is true not only for the second order term but for all coefficients of the expansion . for @xmath32",
    "the conditions for applying perturbation theory are more favorable than for @xmath30 since the unperturbed ground state energy @xmath33 is separated from all excited states by an energy gap @xmath34 which avoids divergent contributions from small denominators .",
    "we expect therefore that the ground state energy of the peierls - hubbard model can be expanded in a series with a finite radius of convergence , @xmath35 for all @xmath32 and that the coefficients of this expansion can be obtained from perturbation theory .",
    "krivnov and ovchinnikov @xcite have pointed out that within the parquet approximation for a continuum version of the model ( [ hamilt1 ] ) the leading nth order contribution to the ground state energy is @xmath36 .",
    "similar conclusions were obtained by horovitz and solyom @xcite using a scaling approach and by kivelson _",
    "et al _ @xcite by comparison of exact results on the massive thirring model with the perturbation theory for a model of spinless fermions .",
    "fermions with spin were considered in @xcite and again a perturbation expansion in powers of @xmath37 was obtained .",
    "thus the radius of convergence behaves as @xmath38 and even for exponentially small dimerization @xmath26 perturbation theory can be applied over some finite range of @xmath1 .",
    "writing @xmath39 , the ground state energy per site of the electronic part of ( [ hamilt1 ] ) , the expansion of @xmath40 in powers of @xmath1 takes the form @xmath41 where we have used that due to particle - hole symmetry @xmath42 is an even function of @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , in the case of complete dimerization , @xmath43 , it is straightforward to calculate the exact ground state energy and expand it in a series which converges for @xmath44 : @xmath45",
    "in order to determine the equilibrium dimerization we minimize the ground state energy of the hamiltonian ( [ hamilt1 ] ) , including the lattice contribution , with respect to @xmath26 and obtain the condition @xmath46 eq .  ( [ mini ] ) defines the function @xmath47 which can as well be expanded in a series containing only even powers of @xmath1 @xmath48 reinserting eq .",

    "( [ delta2app ] ) and using the asymptotic formula for @xmath72 given in eq .",
    "( [ delta0app ] ) we obtain the result @xmath73 i.e.  the relative weight of the second order term in the expansion of the dimerization @xmath67 increases strongly for @xmath74 , although both @xmath75 and @xmath64 are exponentially small in this limit . unfortunately it becomes rather complicated to calculate the fourth order term @xmath76 using perturbation theory .",
    "we have therefore chosen a different approach based on the exact numerical diagonalization of small systems ( up to @xmath77 lattice sites ) using the lanczos algorithm which allows us to calculate the ground state energy with a relative precision of better than @xmath78 . in order to avoid even - odd oscillations we have implemented antiperiodic boundary conditions for @xmath79 and periodic boundary conditions for @xmath80 .",
    "this guarantees that the ground state is non - degenerate . since we know the exact second order term @xmath81 ( for given system size @xmath82 ) it is possible to extract @xmath83 with very high precision",
    "however , one is left with the problem of extrapolating these values to @xmath84 .",
    "we have tried various extrapolation procedures . for @xmath85 the ansatz @xmath86 , which is motivated by the existence of a gap in the excitation spectrum , yields very stable results for @xmath87 . in particular , the asymptotic behavior close to the fully dimerized limit , @xmath88 for @xmath89 is correctly recovered ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : eps4 ] ) .",
    "however , for @xmath90 we could not perform a reliable finite - size scaling of our data .",
    "the reason is that the correlation length , which is inversely proportional to the gap , is getting much larger than the size of the systems that can be diagonalized numerically . on the other hand , for @xmath30 where there is no gap , an unbiased polynomial fit yields @xmath91 which is quite close to the exact value @xcite @xmath92 . in fig .",

    "the application of perturbation theory is justified by the existence of a gap in the excitation spectrum which removes the problem of small denominators . on the other hand , it is also due to this gap that finite - size scaling of the lanczos data becomes problematic for small dimerization @xmath90 where the correlation length exceeds the size of the systems that can be diagonalized numerically .",
    "the central result of this paper is the determination of the exact value of the el - ph coupling @xmath2 which separates the region where the hubbard interaction enhances the dimerization @xmath117 from the region where the dimerization is reduced @xmath118 .",
