    "open quantum systems are at the heart of many physical phenomena from nuclear physics to quantum information theory  @xcite . in fact , all `` real '' quantum systems are , to some extent , open systems .",
    "interactions with the environment cause decoherence , resulting in non - equilibrium dynamics .",
    "it is often simpler to design experiments that probe non - equilibrium physics than it is to design experiments that probe equilibrium physics .",
    "conversely , the theoretical toolkit for describing systems in equilibrium is generally much farther developed than that for describing systems in non - equilibrium .",
    "ultracold atom systems provide a platform for realizing clean and tunable quantum systems  @xcite . over the past few years",
    ", much effort has gone into describing non - equilibrium experiments that are accessible , within approximate or exact frameworks , to theory .",
    "notable experiments are the equilibration dynamics of one - dimensional bose gases  @xcite , the spin dynamics of dipolar molecules in optical lattices with low filling factor  @xcite , and the tunneling dynamics of effectively one - dimensional few - fermion systems  @xcite .",
    "this paper focuses on the latter set of experiments .",
    "specifically , the goal of the present work is to describe the tunneling dynamics of few - fermion systems , which are prepared in a well defined quasi - eigenstate ( metastable state ) , into free space .",
    "we consider small systems and directly solve the time - dependent schrdinger equation in coordinate space .",
    "as we will show , this approach provides a means to quantify the importance of the particle - particle interaction , covering time scales from a fraction of the trap scale to thousands times the trap scale .",
    "alternatively , one could adopt a quantum optics perspective and pursue a master equation approach .",
    "tunneling is arguably the most quantum phenomenon there is : if the system was behaving classically , tunneling would be absent  @xcite .",
    "tunneling plays an important role across physics , chemistry and technology .",
    "the scanning tunneling microscope  @xcite , for example , nicely illustrates how a physics phenomenon , the tunneling of electrons , has been turned into a powerful practical tool ( the imaging of materials ) .",
    "the @xmath1-decay , i.e. , the decay of a @xmath2he nucleus from a heavy nucleus , is an example discussed in most undergraduate physics texts ( see , for example , ref .",
    "the typical picture is to identify an effective reaction coordinate and to obtain the tunneling rate from a wkb analysis .",
    "while powerful , such treatments completely neglect the effect of interactions .",
    "interactions also play a crucial role in sorting out under which conditions electrons in light atoms tunnel sequentially or simultaneously  @xcite . the two - particle system considered in this work",
    "has been realized experimentally and is the possibly simplest scenario that deals with a truly open quantum system ( the atoms can escape to infinity ) in which interactions ( short - range atom - atom interactions ) play a crucial role .",
    "as we will show , even for this relatively simple set - up , matching theory and experiment is a non - trivial task .",
    "of course , two - particle tunneling has been investigated previously in this and related contexts  @xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec_system ] introduces the hamiltonian , the heidelberg experiment and selected simulation details .",
    "sections  [ sec_molecular ] and [ sec_upper ] discuss the molecular and upper branch tunneling dynamics . for both cases , it is argued that the trapping potential needs to be reparameterized . using the reparameterized trapping potential , numerical simulations for the tunneling dynamics of two distinguishable @xmath0li atoms on the molecular branch and the upper branch",
