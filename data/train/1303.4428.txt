    "the discovery that string theory admits an enormous number of flux vacua @xcite has played a formative role in the theory s development for well over a decade . aspects of these vacua , from their phenomenological and cosmological properties to their distribution and statistical features , have been extensively studied @xcite . yet , due to the complexity of this landscape of vacua , many basic questions remain . in this paper",
    "we undertake a study , pursued from a variety of perspectives in a number of works @xcite , that is of potential relevance to one such vital question : do we expect these vacua to be long - lived ?",
    "as a direct analysis would present formidable challenges , we instead consider generic , field theoretic models of the landscape and study how the stability of vacua varies as the dimension of the moduli space ( the number of fields ) increases .",
    "our results suggest that tunneling rates , and hence vacuum instability , grow so rapidly with the number of moduli that the probability of a given local minimum being metastable is exponentially small .    in field",
    "theory , vacuum decay by quantum tunneling was studied by coleman  @xcite .",
    "he showed that the decay proceeded by the nucleation of bubbles of a lower vacuum inside the original false vacuum . in the semiclassical approximation the nucleation rate per unit volume is governed by a bounce solution of the euclidean field equations .",
    "it can be written in the form @xmath1 , where @xmath2 depends on the determinant of fluctuations around the bounce solution and @xmath3 is the euclidean action of the bounce .",
    "the analysis was extended to include gravitational effects by coleman and de luccia  @xcite .",
    "for decay from a de sitter vacuum the resulting corrections to the nucleation rate are typically small unless the potentials are planckian in scale or the bubbles nucleate with a size comparable to the horizon length . with unusually flat potential barriers",
    "it can happen that there is no coleman - de luccia bounce , but in such cases there is always a hawking - moss  @xcite solution corresponding to a process in which an entire horizon volume fluctuates to the top of the potential barrier .    in string theory the large number of vacua and moduli fields",
    "complicates the situation , but at the same time opens up lines of attack based on statistical analysis .",
    "for example , denef and douglas @xcite proposed a method of calculating the density of flux vacua in the string landscape in terms of the khler potential on the moduli space of a given calabi - yau compactification .",
    "their work showed that a sharp accumulation of vacua generally occurs near the conifold locus in moduli space .",
    "dine et al .",
    "@xcite used scaling arguments to conclude that vacua in the string landscape with small cosmological constant become unstable when fluxes are large relative to their compactification volume .",
    "chen et al .",
    "@xcite and marsh et al .",
    "@xcite showed that increasing the number of moduli fields suppresses exponentially the chance that a randomly chosen critical point will be a minima , with the suppression growing for vacua with high energy .    in this paper",
    "we also pursue a statistical approach , focusing our analysis on effective field theory models of many - dimensional moduli spaces .",
    "we provide numerical evidence that the rate for tunneling out of a typical false vacuum grows rapidly as a function of the number of moduli fields .",
    "specifically , the fraction of vacua with tunneling rates low enough to maintain metastability appears to fall as an exponential of a power of the moduli space dimension .    in sec .",
    "[ many - fields ] we describe our approach for estimating tunneling rates in field theoretical models of high - dimensional moduli spaces .",
    "our numerical methods and results are described in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] .",
    "these results reveal a general feature of high - dimensional field theories and are independent of applications to the string landscape . in sec .",
    "[ implications ] we discuss the efficacy of using random potentials to model the string landscape , and emphasize various considerations that would need to be resolved before a direct application could be justified . in sec .",
    "[ multiverse ] we estimate the maximum dimension of moduli spaces whose associated flux landscape would be expected to generically contain metastable vacua , assuming that our numerics and extrapolations are applicable .",
    "the result is a drastic reduction in the number of metastable vacua . finally , in sec .  [ conclusions ] we suggest future directions for studying these models and summarize our conclusions .",
    "we consider the dynamics of a moduli space spanned by @xmath4 scalar fields @xmath5 with a lagrangian @xmath6 the potential @xmath7 will in general have many local minima that correspond to metastable false vacua .",
    "let us consider one of these which , by a shifting of the field variables , can be taken to lie at the origin of field space , @xmath8 . assuming the potential to be smooth at this point",
    ", we can expand it in a power series @xmath9 here @xmath10 , with dimensions of mass , is a characteristic distance in field space that corresponds to a typical distance between stationary points of @xmath7 .",
    "we have also extracted a dimensionless constant @xmath11 , to be chosen so that the dimensionless coefficients of the power series in brackets are of order unity .",
    "finally , we have used the freedom to make an o(@xmath4 ) transformation on the fields to eliminate off - diagonal terms in the quadratic term of the power series .",
    "the exponent @xmath3 in the bubble nucleation rate is the action of the euclidean bounce solution .",
    "we ignore gravitational effects and assume o(4 ) symmetry , with the fields being functions only of @xmath12 .",
    "the bounce then satisfies @xmath13 the boundary conditions are that @xmath14 , its false vacuum value , and that @xmath15 .",
    "the actual value of the field at the origin is not determined in advance , but must be a point on the opposite side of the potential barrier from the false vacuum .",
    "note that , except in the thin - wall limit , @xmath16 is never equal to the true vacuum value",
    ".    we will consider large ensembles of potentials , with the coefficients in the power series chosen randomly , as described in more detail in the next section .",
    "ideally , we would calculate the nucleation rate for each potential by solving the bounce equations .",
    "however , finding bounce solutions in a theory with more than one scalar field is a daunting numerical problem .",
    "doing so for a large sample of potentials is clearly infeasible .",
    "instead , we invoke a more easily calculable proxy that can provide an indication of how the decay rate varies with the number of fields .",
    "a bounce solution may be viewed as containing a wall region , in which the fields pass through the barrier in @xmath17 , and an interior region where the fields are close to their values in the new vacuum .",
    "the distinction between the two regions becomes exact in the thin - wall approximation , which is valid in the limit where @xmath18 , the difference between the energy densities of the true and false vacua , tends to zero . in this approximation",
    "the fields in the interior region take on exactly their true vacuum values .",
    "the radius @xmath19 of the bounce is determined by a balance between the negative action in the bounce interior and the positive action in the wall . with a single scalar field ,",
    "this wall action is the product of the three - dimensional area of bounce and a surface tension that is well approximated by @xmath20 } \\right| \\ , , \\label{sigma - def}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 denotes the point on the true vacuum side of the barrier such that @xmath22 . with additional scalar fields ,",
    "@xmath23 is obtained by integrating along a path in field space running from the false vacuum to a point near the true vacuum , with the path and endpoint chosen to minimize the integral .",
    "the net result is that @xmath24 , while the tunneling exponent is @xmath25 thus , in the rare cases in which we have two almost degenerate vacua , the thin - wall approximation is applicable , @xmath3 is large , bubble nucleation is greatly suppressed , and the false vacuum is long - lived . since our focus is on effects that enhance bubble nucleation , this approximation is not of direct interest to us .",
    "nevertheless , we can draw some useful insight from it .",
    "equation  ( [ twab ] ) shows a strong dependence on @xmath18",
    ". this can not continue outside the thin - wall approximation , because then the field in the bounce solution never reaches the true vacuum , and so can not be directly sensitive to the value of @xmath18 .",
    "on the other hand , the surface tension is closely related to the form of the potential barrier and should continue to be relevant .    outside the thin - wall limit , the boundary between the wall and the bounce interior is not well defined . a reasonable prescription would be to take it to be the hypersurface in euclidean space on which @xmath17 is equal to its false vacuum value .",
    "we could then define a quantity @xmath23 as before , with the integration path running from the false vacuum to a point on the hypersurface @xmath26 in field space , lying on the other side of the potential barrier , on which @xmath27 .",
    "the path and the specific endpoint on @xmath26 would be chosen to minimize the integral .",
    "unfortunately , performing the required minimization for a large ensemble of potentials is still calculationally infeasible .",
    "however , a plausible approximation is at hand .",
    "we might expect the minimizing path to pass though the region in field space where the barrier in @xmath17 is lowest .",
    "this suggests considering a straight - line path running from @xmath8 , though each saddle point , @xmath28 , on the surrounding barrier , and ending on @xmath26 .",
    "in fact , since on average the contributions from the segments before and after the saddle point will be equal , we follow a slightly simpler approach .",
    "we integrate over only the first part of the path , extract factors of @xmath11 and @xmath10 , and define the line integral @xmath29 }   \\cr         & \\equiv & \\sqrt{\\lambda } \\ , v^3\\ , \\tilde s   \\ , , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath30 is a straight - line path in field space running from the false vacuum at @xmath8 to the saddle point",
    ". there may be many saddle points , and thus many such paths .",
    "we expect the tunneling rate to be controlled by the path with the lowest tunneling integral , and define the corresponding value of @xmath31 to be @xmath32    standard scaling arguments show that @xmath3 is inversely proportional to @xmath11 , but independent of @xmath10 , although @xmath10 does affect the prefactor @xmath2 in @xmath33 . outside the thin - wall limit",
    ", the typical bounce radius is @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a numerical factor of order unity .",
    "this suggests that @xmath36 where we have included a factor of @xmath37 because of the four - dimensional spherical symmetry .",
    "a simple test of this estimate can be obtained by numerically evaluating @xmath3 and @xmath38 for a single - field potential with cubic and quartic terms . inserting the results into eq .",
    "( [ b - estimate ] ) and taking @xmath10 to be half the difference between the true and false vacuum values of @xmath39 , one obtains values of @xmath35 that vary between 5.2 and 6.0 over a wide range of parameters away from the thin - wall limit .",
    "this suggests @xmath40    the dilute - gas approximation that underlies the semiclassical approach to bubble nucleation breaks down when @xmath3 is comparable to or less than unity . in this regime",
    "the metastability of the false vacuum has essentially disappeared .",
    "the numerical studies that we describe in the next section show that when many scalar fields are present , the overwhelming majority of potentials lead to a value of @xmath3 too small to maintain metastability with any plausible value of @xmath11 .",
    "we numerically studied ensembles of theories with potentials of the form of eq .",
    "( [ vexpansion ] ) , using @xmath38 as an indicator of the vacuum stability . to make the calculations manageable we truncated the power series at the quartic terms .",
    "an ensemble was defined by taking the @xmath41 to be random numbers uniformly distributed over ranges defined by @xmath42    \\ , , \\cr          a_{ijk}^{(3 ) }   & \\in &   [ -a_3,a_3 ]    \\ , , \\cr          a_{ijkl}^{(4 ) }   & \\in &   [ -a_4,a_4 ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] allowing the @xmath43 to be negative means that the truncated potential is not necessarily bounded from below .",
    "this is not a concern for us , since we are only concerned with the behavior near the minimum ; at larger distances higher - order terms can provide a lower bound on @xmath7 .    because we will be comparing theories with different numbers of fields ,",
    "an important issue is how to vary the @xmath44 as the number of fields is varied . to determine this ,",
    "let us require that the typical variation of the potential in a ball of radius @xmath45 in field space be independent of @xmath4 , the number of fields .",
    "this ensures that , for any number @xmath46 , we can recover results for @xmath47 fields by considering an @xmath48-dimensional cross section of the analysis for @xmath4 fields . in turn",
    ", this ensures that dependencies we find on @xmath4 are not due to peculiar @xmath4-dependent normalizations in @xmath7 .    with this assumption ,",
    "the typical value for each of the @xmath5 in such a ball of radius @xmath45 is of order @xmath49 .",
    "the quadratic term is a sum of positive contributions and will be independent of @xmath4 if @xmath50 is .",
    "there are @xmath51 cubic terms , each of magnitude @xmath52 . because these can be of either sign",
    ", they will tend to cancel , so that the effective number of terms is of order @xmath53 and we are led to take @xmath54 to also be @xmath4-independent .",
    "a similar argument shows that @xmath55 should also be independent of @xmath4 .    as for the actual values of the @xmath44 , note that a change of any two of these can be absorbed by a redefinition of @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "hence , there is no loss of generality in taking @xmath56 .",

    "figure  [ quartictensionandheight ] shows the median values of these quantities within each ensemble as functions of @xmath4 for the quartic potential . for both quantities",

    "this is generally a good approximation .",
    "it should be noted , though , that in a de sitter vacuum with a relatively flat barrier the hawking - moss bounce provides an alternative mode of vacuum decay .",

    "our numerical studies indicate that the barrier height relative to the false vacuum ( i.e. , @xmath81 ) has a power law falloff with @xmath4 quite similar to that found in the effective wall tension @xmath38 , thus implying a similar enhancement of the hawking - moss transition rate .",
    "the results we have described so far are a general feature of quantum field theories .",
    "our motivation for studying random multi - field potentials , however , is the landscape of string theory . in this section , therefore , we assess the applicability and implications of our findings for the string landscape .    not only does the enormous number of local minima in the high dimensional string theory landscape ( which can serve as the endpoints of tunneling events ) offer the possibility of significant enhancement of tunneling probabilities , , in a one - dimensional moduli space is described by @xmath82 $ ] , where @xmath83 is the distance from the conifold point @xcite ; applying this result near a generic point along the conifold locus in an @xmath84-dimensional moduli space shows the rapid growth in the number of vacua , @xmath85 , with @xmath84 . ]",
    "but we have also seen that such large numbers of fields result in the exponential suppression of tunneling barriers .",
    "the question we now briefly consider is the extent to which the random potentials we have analyzed in the previous sections provide accurate insight into properties of the string landscape .    for definiteness , focus on a standard flux compactification of type iib string theory on a calabi - yau manifold @xmath86 . with @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath89 the rr and ns - ns three - form fluxes , and @xmath90 the axio - dilaton , the gukov - vafa - witten superpotential @xmath91 is given by  @xcite @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the holomorphic 3-form on @xmath86 .",
    "the associated flux potential @xmath7 is given by @xmath94    assume that @xmath95 , together with additional contributions ( e.g.  d3-brane instantons or wrapped d7-branes ) , stabilizes all moduli @xcite .",
    "then consider @xmath96 as @xmath86 varies among all calabi - yau s , @xmath95 varies over flux values , the khler stabilizing contributions vary over all possibilities , and supersymmetry - breaking effects similarly scan a broad range . with all such variations in play , the local minima of @xmath97 will sweep through a large class of vacua . in the vicinity of any such vacuum state , we can expand the effective potential , yielding a field theory model of the form ( [ vexpansion ] ) .",
    "now , considering all such expansions that arise from all local minima of the collection @xmath97 , we expect the expansion coefficients to randomly vary .",
    "indeed , such random variation inspired the ansatz we chose in our numerical studies .",
    "but in applying the results of the previous sections to the string landscape , there are a number of details and complications that deserve further attention .",
    "first , we have assumed that the action for tunneling trajectories is well approximated by our proxy : twice that of a straight line in field space connecting the minima being studied and the optimal saddle point on the surrounding barrier . yet , tunneling trajectories in multidimensional field spaces are notoriously subtle and can exhibit unexpected features ; explicit examples in the landscape are the conifunneling trajectories between monodromy - related flux vacua found in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . an additional , and potentially pivotal , complication is that the different flux vacua that are not monodromy related are generally minima of distinct potentials .",
    "physically , such transitions invoke features not captured by our local field theoretic model , including for example the nucleation of branes to absorb changes in flux @xcite .",
    "these effects might significantly affect the tunneling action , and possibly mitigate the field theory instabilities we have identified .",
    "second , we have assumed that as the stabilizing contributions to a given model are varied the effective potentials around local minima will have expansions that are well modeled by random polynomials .",
    "is this correct ? to be concrete , consider the part of the potential arising from the flux , @xmath95 . on a given calabi - yau , @xmath86 , there are dim @xmath98 fluxes that enter @xmath95 . as those fluxes vary , we have far fewer free parameters than the coefficients in eq .",
    "( [ vexpansion ] ) .",
    "however , the associated minima of @xmath7 will occur at different locations , @xmath99 , in the moduli space of @xmath86 . as the holomorphic form @xmath93 depends on @xmath99 , the coefficients in a local expansion of the superpotential , eq .",
    "( [ superpot ] ) , and the corresponding potential , eq .",
    "( [ susyv ] ) , will also vary with @xmath99 .",
    "so , the local potential will be randomized both by the varying fluxes and by the varying values of the period vector over the moduli space .",
    "it seems reasonable to us that this will result in local expansions well modeled by the random potentials invoked in sec .",
    "[ numerics ] , but we do not have a firm argument .",
    "we will return to this issue in a forthcoming work , where we will explicitly check this for specific calabi - yau s with low - dimensional moduli spaces .",
    "third , we have taken a canonical form for the kinetic terms in our field theoretic models .",
    "it is well known , however , that string vacua are densest in the vicinity of the conifold locus , where the classical moduli space metric suffers from a curvature singularity . in particular , near a generic point on the conifold locus we can choose local coordinates @xmath100 on the moduli space such that @xmath101 labels the conifold .",
    "near @xmath102 the moduli space metric @xmath95 behaves as :    @xmath103    the local form of the action then takes the form @xmath104,\\ ] ] where @xmath105 is the space - time metric . in this expression",
    "the coordinates @xmath106 are the moduli space representation of the scalar fields @xmath39 and @xmath7 is their flux potential . at any non - singular point we can , of course , use a local change of field variables to absorb @xmath95 into the @xmath106 , yielding a canonical kinetic term . but as we approach a conifold point , this change of variables corresponds to reducing the barrier heights in @xmath7 ( assuming @xmath7 is continuous and is being expanded about a local minimum ) and thus increases tunneling rates . in the regions of moduli space that are most densely populated with string vacua , we therefore expect the non - canonical kinetic terms to augment the destabilization we have found .",
    "fourth , since the flux potential @xmath7 is derived from the superpotential @xmath91 , and it is @xmath91 that directly incorporates flux values , a more accurate representation of the landscape arises from randomly varying coefficients in a local expansion of @xmath91 , and then using the result to calculate the random potentials . in principle , the relationships between the coefficients in @xmath7 , which reflect its origin in @xmath91 , could alter our findings .",
    "we have undertaken such an analysis .",
    "specifically , we considered a theory with @xmath4 chiral superfields @xmath107 .",
    "the superpotential @xmath91 was taken to be a polynomial @xmath108 the @xmath109 were randomly chosen real numbers in the range @xmath110 $ ] , while @xmath111 and @xmath112 were complex numbers whose real and imaginary parts were taken randomly from the interval @xmath113 $ ] . the scalar field potential derived from @xmath91",
    "was then truncated at quartic order and analyzed in a fashion similar to our non - supersymmetric potentials . with up to",
    "@xmath114 superfields we again find a power law falloff with @xmath4 . because the @xmath4 chiral superfields correspond to @xmath115 real scalar fields , instead of writing the fits to the data as in eq .",
    "( [ s - fit ] ) we write , e.g. , @xmath116 as can be seen from the data in our tables , the various fit parameters are rather similar to those for the nonsupersymmetric case , with the most notable difference being that @xmath64 varies as @xmath117 , compared to @xmath118 in the non - supersymmetric case .",
    "this example also illustrates the challenges of investigating random potentials for large numbers of fields . in all of our studies ,",
    "supersymmetric or not , computational considerations have forced us to only probe a limited range of values of @xmath4 , the number of fields , and work with truncated potentials .",
    "we are assuming that the pattern we have found , as evidenced in figs .",
    "[ quartictensionandheight]-[quarticdistributions ] , will continue to hold as these constraints are relaxed .",
    "our results have immediate implications for attempts to find a multiverse solution to the cosmological constant problem in such field theory models .",
    "the argument for such a solution is that even if the natural scale for the cosmological constant in a typical vacuum is planckian , one might expect to find vacua with @xmath119 in planck units if the number of vacua is much greater than @xmath120 . because we want a vacuum that has not only a small @xmath121 but also a long lifetime ,",
    "what we actually need is that the number of truly metastable vacua be much greater than @xmath120 .",
    "let us suppose that the number of vacua is @xmath122 , with perhaps @xmath123 . for metastability , we require that the tunneling exponent @xmath3 be no smaller than a value @xmath124 of order unity .",
    "the number of metastable vacua is then @xmath125 with @xmath126 given by eq .",
    "( [ fractionest ] ) .",
    "the requirement that this be greater than @xmath120 can be written as @xmath127 with @xmath128    this clearly needs large @xmath4 , at least more than 120 if @xmath123 as in the usual analysis .",
    "the new feature here is that , because of the enhancement of the tunneling rate at large @xmath4 , taking @xmath4 to be too large makes matters worse rather than better .",
    "in fact , there may be no value of @xmath4 for which this condition is satisfied .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ quarticrange ] , where we have taken @xmath129 , the power we obtained from the analysis of quartic non - supersymmetric potentials . for @xmath123",
    "the allowed values of @xmath4 and @xmath130 correspond to the region to the left of the solid curve .",
    "we see that there are no acceptable values of @xmath4 for @xmath131 , and that the range of allowed @xmath4 is relatively restricted until @xmath130 falls well below this value .",
    "if instead we take @xmath132 , the allowed region extends to the dashed line , with the maximum allowed @xmath130 increased by roughly a factor of four .",
    "the effect of varying the power @xmath61 can be seen in fig .",
    "[ susyrange ] , where we have set @xmath133 , the value from our supersymmetric data .",
    "although the curve is similar to that in the previous case , the values of @xmath130 have fallen by more than an order of magnitude .     and",
    "@xmath123 , a sufficient number of metastable vacua is only possible for parameters in the region to the left of the solid line .",
    "this region is extended to the dashed line if @xmath132 . ,",

    "motivated by the string landscape , we have undertaken a study of the stability of vacua in multi - field quantum theories .",
    "our study has focused on random potentials with the number of fields @xmath136 and on polynomial expansions that include no more than quartic field contributions . even with these constraints , coming from computational feasibility ,",
    "the data we have accumulated provide evidence that transition rates are so rapidly enhanced as a function of @xmath4 that all but an exponentially small fraction of generic local minima in such quantum field theories are unstable to rapid decay .",
    "one consequence is that the range of parameters that give a sufficient number of metastable vacua to provide a natural solution to the cosmological constant problem is severely restricted .",
    "for example , if the moduli space dimension @xmath137 and there are @xmath138 vacua , the `` coupling '' @xmath11 characterizing the landscape must be less than 1/20 or so ; with @xmath139 , @xmath11 must be an order of magnitude smaller .",
    "alternatively , if @xmath140 and @xmath137 , then @xmath141 must be greater than @xmath142 .    these considerations are potentially relevant to any model invoking anthropic explanations for the cosmological constant in which the required diversity of vacua is due to the model containing a high dimensional moduli space . however , since our results have been obtained in the context of a field theory with multiple scalar fields , the impact of similar considerations on the ability of the string landscape to offer a natural solution to the cosmological constant puzzle will require further study .",
