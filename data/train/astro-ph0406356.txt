    "the visibilities were calibrated by observing sources of known angular size .",

    "in addition to the pti data , we obtained adaptive optics images of the sources in our sample . as we discuss in  [ sec : viscorr ] , the adaptive optics data help distinguish between components of the pti visibilities , including circumstellar emission , the central stars , and nearby companions .    using the palomar 200-inch adaptive optics system ( palao ;",
    "* ) with the pharo camera @xcite on november 17 - 18 , 2002 , january 13 - 14 , 2003 , and july 14 - 15 , 2003 , we imaged our sources in the jhk bands with a 25 mas plate scale and a @xmath19 field of view .",

    "the determined jhk magnitudes of our target sources are listed in table [ tab : sources ] . while the single - night uncertainty of the photometry is typically @xmath21 mags , night - to - night variations ( due to variable seeing and small instrumental changes ) limit the photometric accuracy to @xmath22 mags . since as 442 appears to be variable with a short timescale ( probably days ) , table [ tab : sources ] quotes the average of two measurements .",

    "from the pti data , we measured calibrated squared visibilities for all sources listed in table [ tab : sources ] . for each source , we constrain the angular size and geometry of the emission by fitting the visibility data with several simple models : gaussians , uniform disks , uniform rings , flat accretion disks with inner holes , and flared passive disks with puffed - up inner walls . in this section , we describe the models , as well as corrections to the visibilities required to separate the circumstellar component from contributions by the central stars or nearby companions .",
    "nearby companions that lie outside the interferometric field of view , @xmath18 mas , but within the field of view of the detector , @xmath24 , will contribute incoherent light to the visibilities , leading to measured visibilities smaller than the true values : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the difference in k - band magnitudes between the two stars .",
    "our palao adaptive optics images of the sources in our sample (  [ sec : ao ] ) show that most of these have no bright companions ( @xmath27 ) at distances between @xmath18 mas and @xmath28 , and thus no companion corrections are required ( @xmath29 ) . for mwc 1080 , we measured @xmath30 for a companion at @xmath31 separation ( consistent with previous measurements by corporon 1998 ) and equation [ eq : companion ] yields a correction factor of 0.85 .",
    "v1685 cyg is also known to have a faint companion ( @xmath32 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but its effects on the visibilities are negligible .",
    "we account for the effect of the central star on the visibilities by including it in the models : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the stellar flux , @xmath35 is the excess flux ( both measured at 2.2 @xmath0 m ) , @xmath36 is the visibility of the ( unresolved ) central star , and @xmath37 is the visibility due to the circumstellar component .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that @xmath36 , since for the stellar radii ( @xmath389 r@xmath2 ) and distances ( @xmath391000 pc ) for our sample , the angular diameters of the central stars will be @xmath40 mas . in the case of the binary model described below (  [ sec : binary ] ) , we do not perform any such correction , since the basic model already includes the stellar component .",
    "since haebe objects are often variable at near - ir wavelengths ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we obtained nearly contemporaneous photometric k - band measurements for our sample , as described in  [ sec : ao ] .",
    "as in elahs , we calculate @xmath34 and @xmath35 using our k - band photometry ( table [ tab : sources ] ) combined with bvri photometry , visual extinctions , stellar radii , and effective temperatures from the literature @xcite . for several sources where literature values were not available , we computed the stellar parameters using the published spectral types and photometry .",
    "the spectral type gives the effective temperature and expected color , from which we determine the extinction .",
    "we determine the stellar luminosity ( using the adopted distance from table [ tab : sources ] ) from a bolometric correction applied to the optical photometry , and stellar radius is given by the stephan - boltzmann equation .",
    "assuming that all of the short - wavelength flux is due to the central star , we fit a blackbody at the assumed effective temperature to the de - reddened bvri data .",
    "de - reddening uses the extinction law of steenman & th ( 1991 ) .",
    "the k - band stellar flux , @xmath34 , is derived from the value of this blackbody curve at 2.2 @xmath0 m , and the excess flux , @xmath35 , is given by the difference between the de - reddened observed flux and the stellar flux .",
    "the derived fluxes are given in table [ tab : sources ] .",
    "the uncertainties in our k - band photometric measurements ( @xmath22 mags ) and the uncertainties in the optical photometry used to determine the stellar contributions to the k - band fluxes lead to some uncertainties in the sizes inferred from the interferometric data .",
    "this uncertainty decreases for larger @xmath41 ratios , and is typically @xmath42 mas for the sources discussed here .",
    "cq tau , vv ser , v1685 cyg , and as 442 are optically variable by @xmath43 magnitudes on timescales of days to months ( while the other sources in our sample show little or no optical variability ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and thus @xmath34 is somewhat uncertain .",
    "however , since @xmath44 for these objects , this uncertainty is relatively unimportant when modeling the visibilities .",
    "uncertainties in the calculation of stellar and circumstellar fluxes can also have a small effect on the measured inclinations .",
    "however , since the fluxes for our sample are dominated by the excess component , only large errors ( @xmath45 ) in the flux estimation will produce measurable effects on the determined inclinations .",
    "since our photometric errors are generally @xmath46 , the effect on measured inclinations is negligible .",
    "equation [ eq : vtot ] assumes that the point - like central star and compact circumstellar emission contribute coherently to the visibilities .",
    "there may also be an incoherent component due to extended emission ( either thermal or scattered ) from tenuous dust",
    ". the excess flux , @xmath35 , would then be the sum of the compact circumstellar emission , @xmath47 , and the extended emission , @xmath48 . including the incoherent contribution in the visibilities would modify equation [ eq : vtot ] to :",
    "@xmath49   v_{\\rm x}}{f_{\\ast } + f_{\\rm x } } \\right)^2 , \\label{eq : vscatt}\\ ] ] causing a reduction in the measured visibilities .",
    "the existence of dust on large angular scales around some herbig ae / be stars is illustrated by optical light scattered from dust grains far from the star ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "furthermore , sed models that include large - scale optically thin dust , in addition to disks , usually fit the data well for haebe sources ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "nevertheless , these observations do not measure the exact contribution of extended k - band emission , and our adaptive optics observations (  [ sec : ao ] ) do not have sufficient sensitivity to detect faint emission above the halo of the point spread function within @xmath28 ( the pti field of view ) of the central stars .",
    "thus , we do not include the effect of incoherent emission when modeling the visibilities ; i.e. , we use equation [ eq : vtot ] in the analysis below .    because our measured visibilities are found to depend on projected baseline",
    "( see  [ sec : models ] ) , contrary to the baseline - independent visibilities expected for incoherent emission , the incoherent contribution is probably insignificant compared to the compact circumstellar component .",
    "although small incoherent contributions may lead to estimated size scales slightly larger than true values , we show below in  [ sec : pti+iota ] that the effect is likely to be quite small , perhaps as high as a few percent in the worst case .      for each source",
    ", we compare the observed visibilities to those derived from a uniform disk model , a gaussian model , a ring model , a geometrically flat accretion disk model with an inner hole , and a flared passive disk with a puffed - up inner wall ; all models are 2-d . the uniform disk , gaussian , ring , and flat accretion disk models were discussed in elahs , and the basic equations are merely recalled here .",
    "in addition , we develop and implement a flared disk model with a puffed - up inner wall , which is a more physically plausible model than any of those considered in elahs . as in elahs , we consider both face - on and inclined models . if we assume that the inclination of the circumstellar material is zero , then the one remaining free parameter in the models is the angular size scale , @xmath50 .",
    "when we include inclination effects , we fit for three parameters : size ( @xmath50 ) , inclination angle ( @xmath51 ) , and position angle ( @xmath52 ) .",
    "inclination is defined such that a face - on disk has @xmath53 , and position angle , @xmath52 , is measured east of north .",
    "inclination effects are included in the models via a simple coordinate transformation : @xmath54 @xmath55 here , @xmath56,@xmath57 are the original sky and @xmath7 plane coordinates , and @xmath58,@xmath59 are the transformed coordinates .",
    "in addition to these five models , we also examine whether the data are consistent with a wide binary model , which we approximate as two stationary point sources . for this model ,",
    "the free parameters are the angular separation ( @xmath50 ) , the position angle ( @xmath52 ) , and the brightness ratio of the two components ( @xmath60 ) .",
    "we fit these models to the pti data for each source by searching grids of parameters for the minimum @xmath61 value .",

    ", we also fit inclined disk models , where in addition to varying @xmath50 , we vary @xmath51 from 0@xmath8 to @xmath62 and @xmath52 from 0@xmath8 to @xmath63 , both in increments of @xmath64 .",
    "since inclined disk models are symmetric under reflections through the origin , we do not explore position angles between @xmath63 and @xmath65 .",

    "although binary models are not symmetric under reflections through the origin , pti does not measure phase and can not distinguish 180@xmath8-rotated models ; thus , we only consider position angles from 0@xmath8 to @xmath63 .    for each point in the parameter grid , we generate a model for the observed @xmath7 coverage , and calculate the reduced chi squared , @xmath61 , to determine the `` best - fit '' model .",

    "the primary difference between this model and the geometrically flat model discussed above is the angle at which starlight is incident on the disk .",

    "future measurements with interferometers possessing even smaller fields of view ( e.g. , _ keck interferometer _ with a 50 mas field of view ) , when combined with the data discussed here , will constrain further the effects of extended emission on the measured visibilities .    for mwc 1080 , while the k - band visibilities from iota and pti are compatible ( the fit to the combined dataset gives very similar parameters to those determined in  [ sec : res ] ) , the h - band data appears to be inconsistent with a disk model .",

    "the far - ir photometry for these objects appears somewhat inconsistent with the models , perhaps due to tenuous dust halos , or possibly due to source confusion in the large iras beams ( not unlikely given that these higher - mass stars are found in small stellar clusters ) . for these early - type sources",

    "later than b9 , the seds are generally fit well by flared disk models with puffed - up inner walls ( figure [ fig : ddn - seds ] ) .",
    "while the puffed - up inner disk wall generally fits the near - ir data well , for cq tau and t ori the model does not fit the long - wavelength data .",
    "although this disagreement may be lessened for t ori using a non - zero inclination ( we assumed a face - on disk since no inclination estimate is available from our near - ir interferometry ) , the outer disk structure of cq tau is inconsistent with the model . moreover , many of the sources in our sample require flaring angles smaller than those predicted by standard flared - disk models ( i.e. , @xmath203 ) , which could support the contention of ddn that shadowing by the inner rim plays a prominent role in the outer disk structure of haebes .    motivated by monnier & millan - gabet ( 2002 )",
    ", we explore the apparently different disk structure for early and late - type haebes from a different perspective in figure [ fig : size - lum ] , where we plot the ratio of predicted to measured inner disk size as a function of stellar luminosity for the two different disk models .",
    "the predicted inner disk size is computed by assuming the disk is heated only by stellar radiation ( i.e. , no accretion ) , and using the structure equations for flat or puffed - up inner disks ( see elahs ) to determine the radius where @xmath121 . for each source , @xmath86 is the value determined from the sed ( table [ tab : seds ] ) .",
    "the measured size is calculated from the angular size determined for either a flat inner disk model (  [ sec : acc ] ) or a puffed - up inner disk wall model (  [ sec : ddn ] ) and the distance assumed in table [ tab : sources ] . since the predicted and measured",
    "sizes are both directly proportional to distance ( elahs ) , the ratio is independent of the assumed distance .",
    "thus , figure [ fig : size - lum ] is effectively testing whether the inner disk sizes determined from the near - ir interferometric data are consistent with the disk temperatures implied by the stellar parameters .",
    "while stellar variability may complicate the interpretation of this diagram , the general trends should be unaffected .",
    "figure [ fig : size - lum ] shows that for later - type sources , the predicted inner disk sizes are within a few tens of percent of the measured values for puffed - up inner disk models , while flat disk models are off by a factor of approximately 2 .",
    "in contrast , the predictions of flat models are reasonably close to measured values for early - type sources , while the puffed - up inner disk models predict inner disk sizes much larger ( factors @xmath159 ) than allowed by the data . including accretion luminosity in flat disk models will lead to warmer inner disk temperatures and thus larger predicted inner radii , in better agreement with the measurements .",
    "while this argues for flat disk models with accretion in early - type herbig be stars , the seds demonstrate that puffed - up inner disk models still provide superior fits for the later - type sources .",
    "our new pti results strengthen the arguments supporting the existence of circumstellar disks around haebe stars presented in  [ sec : intro ] .",
    "resolved , small - scale ( @xmath204 au ) distributions of dust are found in all observed sources except hd 141569 and hd 158352 , and the non - symmetric intensity distributions of best - fit models for most objects provide support for inclined disk geometries .",
    "hd 141569 and hd 158352 show no evidence of near - ir emission in excess of that expected for the stellar photospheres , and thus it is not surprising that we did not resolve any circumstellar emission with pti .",
    "rather , our pti observations imply uniform disk radii @xmath205 r@xmath2 , consistent with the near - ir emission arising in the stellar photospheres for these sources .",
    "although hd 141569 is surrounded by a circumstellar disk , it appears to have a central gap extending out to @xmath206 au @xcite , which explains the lack of near - ir excess emission .",
    "moreover , millimeter observations imply a very low dust mass , suggesting that this system is more evolved than other members of the haebe class @xcite .",
    "although hd 158352 was listed as a candidate haebe by th , de winter , & prez .",
    "( 1994 ) , recent observations suggest that it may in fact be a more evolved source , such as a shell star or vega - like object @xcite .",
    "thus , it appears that hd 141569 and hd 158352 are probably more evolved than most haebe sources ( including the remainder of our sample ) , which may explain the lack of near - ir circumstellar emission for these objects .",
    "the inclination estimates determined from near - ir interferometric data are generally compatible with inclinations inferred from other observations .",
    "our interferometric measurements show that the resolved circumstellar material around mwc 480 , mwc 758 , cq tau , vv ser , v1685 cyg , as 442 , and mwc 1080 is significantly inclined .",

    "furthermore , high inclinations are suggested by resolved mm emission for mwc 480 , mwc 758 , and cq tau (  [ sec : mm ] ) , by optical polarization measurements for cq tau @xcite , and by ro - vibrational co emission for mwc 480 , mwc 758 , and vv ser @xcite .",

    "*  [ sec : pti+iota ] ) , ro - vibrational co emission @xcite , resolved millimeter emission (  [ sec : mm ] ) , scattered optical and near - ir light @xcite , and small amplitude optical variability ( @xmath212 ; * ? ? ?",
    "we also note that the inner disk size for ab aur determined above is consistent with recent observations of ro - vibrational emission from hot co gas , which show that the co lies near to , but somewhat behind the inner disk boundary .",
    "moreover , the co emission is found only in the lowest vibrational state , suggesting that the hot gas is shielded from stellar uv radiation , perhaps by a puffed - up inner disk wall @xcite .    while the v1295 aql data seems consistent with a nearly face - on circumstellar distribution ,",
    "we can not rule out a high inclination value for this source based on the pti data alone . the data for t ori , mwc 120 , and mwc 297 are insufficient to constrain the inclinations .      our pti results probe dust in the inner ( @xmath213 au ) disk , while millimeter interferometric observations probe dust and gas in the outer ( @xmath68 au ) disks of haebe stars . comparison of these observations enables constraints on disk warping .",
    "of our sample , inclinations are available from millimeter co observations for ab aur , cq tau , mwc 480 , and mwc 758 @xcite .",
    "as discussed in earlier papers ( mst ; elahs ) , the inclination for ab aur estimated from the aspect ratio of resolved millimeter co emission , @xmath214 @xcite , is inconsistent with the lower inclinations from near - ir interferometry ( @xmath215 ; elahs ) and modeling of scattered light emission ( @xmath216 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this suggests that the disk around ab aur may be significantly warped , which is difficult to explain theoretically .",
    "however , more detailed kinematic modeling of millimeter observations with higher angular resolution and sensitivity find an outer disk around ab aur inclined by @xmath217 @xcite , compatible with our near - ir results .    for cq tau ,",
    "the aspect ratio estimated from vla data at 7 mm implies an inclination angle ( @xmath218 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) somewhat larger than that determined from near - ir interferometry ( @xmath219 ;  [ sec : cqtau ] ) .",
    "kinematic modeling of more sensitive millimeter observations shows that the outer disk is actually inclined by @xmath209 @xcite , consistent with our pti results .    for mwc 480",
    ", there is some variation in the outer disk geometry based on different observations .",
    "a keplerian model fit to one set of millimeter co observations yields an inclination and position angle of @xmath140 and @xmath220 , respectively @xcite , while another gives @xmath221 and @xmath222 @xcite .",
    "the millimeter continuum , which traces cool dust , gives yet another estimate of geometry ; @xmath223 , @xmath224 @xcite .",
    "we compare these with estimates of the inner disk geometry from our pti results : @xmath225 , @xmath226 .",
    "since the outer disk geometry estimates vary considerably , it is difficult to estimate the true uncertainty in inclination .",
    "however , it seems reasonable to say that the various observations are consistent with no offset at all , and that there is at most a difference of @xmath227 between the inner and outer disk .",
    "while there is an intriguing hint that the dust may be somewhat less inclined than the gas , we can not verify this possibility with the current data .",
    "finally , for mwc 758 , the aspect ratio of millimeter co emission implies a disk inclined by @xmath173 at a position angle of @xmath228 @xcite . for comparison ,",
    "the pti measurements imply an inclination of @xmath229 and a position angle of @xmath230 .",
    "there is some spread between these estimates , but again , it seems that there is a difference of @xmath231 between the inner and outer disk inclinations .",
    "for the 4 sources in our sample that have inner and outer disk geometry measurements , there is little evidence for inner and outer disk mis - alignments of more than a few degrees .",
    "thus , the inner disk geometries derived from our pti data likely describe the structure of the entire disks . while we do not rule out small warps ( up to @xmath232 degrees ) , such as those expected from resonant interactions with giant planets or magnetic warping ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our results argue against significant perturbation due to massive companions ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , consistent with the lack of binaries in our visibility and adaptive optics data .",
    "figures [ fig : hsvk - seds ] and [ fig : ddn - seds ] demonstrate that flared , puffed - up inner disk models tend to fit the seds better than geometrically flat accretion disk models for later - type haebe sources , while flat disk models fit the visibility and sed data well for early - type herbig be sources .",
    "moreover , figure [ fig : size - lum ] clearly demonstrates that puffed - up inner disk models more accurately predict the inner radii of late - type haebes , while geometrically flat disk models are far more accurate for early - type sources .",
    "we have already suggested ( elahs , see also vink et al .",
    "2002 ) that the apparent difference between inner disk geometries for early and late - type haebes may be due do a transition from disk accretion @xcite in early - type stars to magneto - spheric accretion @xcite in later - type stars .",
    "there is abundant evidence for magneto - spheric accretion in t tauri stars ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , and it is plausible that the same accretion mechanism would apply to the more massive herbig ae stars .",
    "magneto - spheric accretion provides a mechanism for truncating the disks around haebe stars , which is necessary to obtain puffed - up inner disk walls ( disk truncation allows direct irradiation of the inner disk regions , leading to higher temperatures and thus larger scale heights ) .",
    "in contrast , for earlier spectral types , such as the herbig be stars , higher accretion rates and/or weaker stellar magnetic fields may allow the accretion flow to overwhelm the magnetic field , leading to disk accretion down to the stellar surface .",
    "our new 2.2 @xmath0 m observations of 14 haebe sources have the best @xmath7 coverage of any near - ir interferometric observations of young stellar objects to date . as a result",
    ", we accurately constrain the sizes and basic geometries of the material around haebes , providing strong evidence for inner circumstellar disks .",
    "we determine the angular size scales and orientations predicted by uniform disk models , gaussian models , uniform ring models , geometrically flat accretion disk models with inner holes , and flared passive disk models with puffed - up inner rims .",
    "all except two sources are resolved , with angular sizes ranging from @xmath233 mas .",
    "ab aur appears to be surrounded by a disk inclined by @xmath234 , while mwc 480 , mwc 758 , cq tau , vv ser , v1685 cyg , as 442 , and mwc 1080 are associated with more highly inclined circumstellar disks ( @xmath235 ) .",
    "we can not rule out a high inclination for v1295 aql , although the data can be explained by a face - on disk model . for t",
    "ori , mwc 120 , and mwc 297 , the @xmath7 coverage is too sparse to enable constraints on the inclination of the circumstellar material .",
    "there is little supporting evidence that our data result from binaries , although we can not rule out binary models for t ori , mwc 120 , mwc 297 , v1295 aql , as 442 , or vv ser .",
    "comparison of our 2.2 @xmath0 m pti visibilities with 1.6 @xmath0 m and 2.2 @xmath0 m visibilities from the iota interferometer ( mst ) shows that the two datasets are consistent , and allows firmer constraints on circumstellar geometry .",
    "since iota has a field of view three times larger than pti , we are also able to constrain the degree to which incoherent emission from extended dust may bias the measured sizes toward larger values .",
    "the smaller field of view of pti leads to very small biases , and the resulting uncertainties in the measured sizes are likely less than a few percent .",
    "we constrain warping of haebe disks by comparing our near - ir measurements of the inner disks with resolved millimeter interferometric measurements of the outer disk geometries ( where available ) .",
    "our results for 4 sources indicate that the inner and outer disks of haebes are not significantly mis - aligned .",
    "while this argues against significant perturbations to the disks , we do not rule out small warps such as those due to interactions between disks and slightly non - coplanar giant planets .",
    "our measurements also enable constraints on the vertical structure of haebe disks . using the derived inner disk parameters , we compute the seds for flat accretion disk models with inner holes and flared passive disk models with puffed - up inner walls , and compare these with measured seds for our sample . geometrically flat disk models fit the data well for the early - type herbig be stars in our sample , mwc 297 , v1685 cyg and mwc 1080 ,",
    "while the flared , puffed - up inner disk models can not fit the data for these objects .",
    "in contrast , flared disk models with puffed - up inner rims provide superior fits to the data for the later - type stars in our sample .",
    "the different inner disk geometries may imply a transition from magneto - spheric accretion in late - type haebes to disk accretion in early - type sources .",
