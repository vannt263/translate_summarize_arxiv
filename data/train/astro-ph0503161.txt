    "the fine - structure constant @xmath0 does not vary as friedmann universes evolve , a conclusion based on assessments of quantum mechanics and electrodynamics .",
    "this research was motivated by predicted evolutionary changes in atoms and in vacuum permittivity @xmath3 .",
    "the spacetime geometry of the friedmann universe depends on the radius @xmath9 @xmath10.\\ ] ]    schrdinger ( 1939 ) found that the wavelength of every quantum wave function is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "this was used to explain hubble redshift of photons from distant nebulae , one of the first clear indications of a dynamic universe .",
    "but schrdinger s result applies to every quantum system .",
    "atoms expand with the universe just as photons do .",
    "calculating the changes in atomic energy levels implied by this evolution leads directly to the constancy of @xmath0 .",
    "@xmath0 is the dimensionless number @xmath11 where @xmath2 is the charge of the electron , @xmath3 is vacuum permittivity , @xmath5 is planck s constant divided by @xmath6 , and @xmath4 is the speed of light .",
    "sumner ( 1994 ) found that @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath9 , @xmath12    this precisely reproduces schrdinger s results for photons and atoms .",
    "the electrodynamic wave equation gives the dependency of the speed of light on @xmath9 , @xmath13 since @xmath2 and @xmath5 do not depend on @xmath9 , @xmath0 does not depend on @xmath9 .",
    "since @xmath0 appears in all first - order perturbation formulas for atomic energy levels , comparisons of the atomic spectra of distant atoms with those in laboratories provide an experimental measure of this prediction .",
    "for example , bahcall et al . ( 2003 ) found @xmath14 yr@xmath15 , corresponding to @xmath16 for quasars with @xmath17 .",
    "other experiments also find changes that are either zero or very small within experimental errors .",
    "the hubble constant @xmath7 and deceleration parameter @xmath8 are determined using precision redshift / magnitude data ( riess et al .",
    "the maximum observed redshift of 5.4 ( rhoads et al .",
    "2004 ) is used to estimate the current value of the friedmann radius @xmath18 as less than @xmath19 .",
    "these further support a major assumption used in this paper that the friedmann solution to einstein s theory of general relativity without cosmological constant is an adequate approximation to spacetime geometry and its long term evolution at quantum scales .",
    "schrdinger ( 1939 ) established that the plane - wave eigenfunctions characteristic of flat spacetime are replaced in the friedmann universe by quantum wave functions with wavelengths directly proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "this means that eigenfunctions change wavelength as @xmath9 changes and the quantum systems they describe do as well . in an expanding universe quantum systems",
    "expand . in a contracting universe they contract .",
    "schrdinger reproduced the changes in photon and particle momenta well known from general relativity , confirming the logic of each approach and the applicability of friedmann geometry to quantum processes .",
    "these changes in quantum systems may equivalently be viewed as a logical consequence of the fact that the energy and momentum of an `` isolated '' system can change in general relativity when the spacetime geometry of the universe changes ( schrdinger 1956 ) .",
    "`` in an expanding space _ all momenta decrease _  for bodies acted on by no other forces than gravitation  this simple law has an even simpler interpretation in wave mechanics : all wavelengths , being inversely proportional to the momenta , simply expand with space . ''",
    "since energy is proportional to the square of momentum , quantum level energies are proportional to @xmath20 . the wavelengths emitted in quantum transitions are therefore proportional to @xmath21 ( sumner & sumner 2000 ) .",
    "this is true for all emissions , including those from atomic states separated by the fine - structure interaction .",
    "bahcall et al . ( 2003 ) considered the wavelengths , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , from two atomic states separated by the fine - structure interaction and proved that `` to very high accuracy  the difference in the wavelengths divided by the average of the wavelengths , @xmath24 , @xmath25 is proportional to @xmath26  a measurement of @xmath24 is a measurement of @xmath26 at the epoch at which  lines are emitted . ''    from schrdinger s perspective each wavelength emitted in a quantum transition is proportional to @xmath21 . to calculate @xmath27 at any epoch , each @xmath28 in equation ( 4 )",
    "would be multiplied by an identical factor . in every case",
    "these factors cancel and @xmath27 is unchanged .",
    "since constant @xmath27 implies constant @xmath0 , the fine - structure constant is unaffected by the coevolution of atoms , photons , and the friedmann universe .",
    "by generalizing electrodynamics to the curved friedmann spacetime of general relativity , a purely geometrical problem in 4-space , sumner ( 1994 ) found that @xmath3 is proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath29 and non - relativistic quantum mechanics exactly reproduce the shifts in atomic energy levels and wavelengths of emitted photons implied by schrdinger s result , i.e. , the wavelengths of emitted photons are proportional to @xmath21 .",
    "as the geometry evolves , the wavelengths of atomic emissions , which are proportional to @xmath21 , change faster than photon wavelengths , which are proportional to @xmath9 .",
    "while both change in the same direction , i.e. , both get redder or both get bluer , the difference in the magnitudes of change reverses the historical interpretation of hubble redshift .",
    "hubble & tolman ( 1935 ) found that there is an approximately linear relationship between the magnitudes of the redshifts observed for distant galaxies and their distances from earth .",
    "the most likely explanation presented by hubble & tolman is that galaxies are receding from the earth .",
    "this conventional conclusion that redshifts imply recession depends critically on the assumption that the wavelengths of light emitted by atoms from distant galaxies in the past are exactly the same as the wavelength of light similar atoms emit today .",
    "but this is not the case .",
    "atoms coevolve with the universe and their emissions change wavelength . today",
    "s standards have shifted .",
    "if the universe were expanding , redshifted photons from distant galaxies would be measured against laboratory atoms which have redshifted more during the time the photon has taken to reach the earth .",
    "the shift observed between the old galactic photon and the current laboratory standard would be blue , contrary to observation .",
    "only when the universe is contracting and blue - shifted photons are compared against bluer atomic standards are the measured shifts red and consistent with hubble s observations .",
    "hubble redshift implies that our universe is contracting .",
    "a contracting friedmann universe must be closed , verifying schrdinger s ( 1939 ) original assumption . ``",
    "wave mechanics imposes an a priori reason for assuming space to be closed ; for then and only then are its proper modes discontinuous and provide an adequate description of the observed atomicity of matter and light . ''",
    "possible changes in @xmath5 must also be considered to determine the variation in @xmath0 .",
    "sumner ( 1994 ) calculated the energy changes for wave solutions to maxwell s equations .",
    "it was found that the energy changes were consistent with the known dependency of wavelength on @xmath9 , verifying that planck s constant @xmath5 relating the two remains constant as @xmath9 changes .",
    "another ( and particularly elegant ) way of looking at the constancy of @xmath5 is to note that @xmath5 is the constant of proportionality between the phase of a wave function in the limiting ( classical ) case and the mechanical action of the physical system , a relationship that does not depend on geometry ( landau & lifshitz 1977 ) .",
    "mller ( 1952 ) also explored the dependence of @xmath3 on spacetime geometry .",
    "he demonstrated that the equation of continuity , implied by electrodynamics , requires that @xmath2 remain constant even as spacetime geometry changes .",
    "the final term in @xmath0 is the speed of light , @xmath4 . for an isotropic , homogeneous medium , the vacuum permittivity",
    "@xmath3 equals the magnetic permeability @xmath30 , an equality not changed by spacetime curvature ( mller 1952 ) .",
    "the velocity of propagation , @xmath4 , is given by @xmath31 equation ( 6 ) and equation ( 3 ) prove the dependency of @xmath4 on @xmath9 .",
    "the variations in @xmath3 and @xmath4 cancel each other and the other terms are constant . consequently @xmath0 remains constant as the curvatures of friedmann universes evolve .",
    "since @xmath0 appears in all first - order perturbation formulas for atomic energy levels , comparisons of the atomic spectra of distant atoms with those in laboratories provide an experimental measure of the theoretical prediction made here that @xmath0 is constant .",
    "bahcall et al . ( 2003 ) used ``  the strong nebular emission lines of o  iii , 5007    and 4959   , to set a robust upper limit on the time dependence of the fine structure constant .",
    "we find @xmath32 yr@xmath15 , corresponding to @xmath33 for quasars with @xmath17  ''",
    "this research was a continuation of work done by bahcall & salpeter ( 1965 ) significantly improving the accuracy , but arriving at the same conclusion .",
    "bahcall et al . ( 2003 ) contains a useful review of methods used to measure changes in @xmath0 .",
    "while most conclude that there is no measurable change in @xmath0 , some conclude that there is statistically significant change .",
    "for example , murphy et al . ( 2003 ) find , `` @xmath34 , representing 4.7@xmath35 evidence for a varying @xmath0 . '' on the other hand , srianand et al .",
    "( 2004 ) conclude that their analysis ``  gives a 3@xmath35 limit , @xmath36 , for the time variation of @xmath0 , that forms the strongest constraint obtained based on high redshift quasar absorption line systems . ''",
    "if @xmath0 does in fact vary in time ( or in space ) , the simplifying assumption that spacetime is adequately modeled by friedmann geomtery would need to be closely reexamined .",
    "two independent lines of theoretical reasoning are presented that conclude the fine - structure constant does not evolve with friedmann geometry .",
    "key assumptions made by schrdinger and sumner are :    1 .   the friedmann solution to einstein s theory of general relativity without cosmological",
    "constant is an adequate approximation to spacetime geometry and its long term evolution at quantum scales ( schrdinger and sumner ) .",
    "classical electrodynamics may be generalized to the curved spacetime of general relativity ( sumner ) .",
    "non - relativistic quantum mechanics is an adequate model for atoms , with fine - structure splitting calculated in the usual way ( sumner ) .",
    "4 .   relativistic quantum mechanics can be used to determine the relationship between quantum wave functions and friedmann geometry ( schrdinger ) .",
    "it has been shown that these assumptions require that atoms coevolve with spacetime geometry . while this conclusion does not agree with einstein s original assumption that physical `` rigid rods '' measure mathematical space , it is not in conflict with general relativity per se as einstein ( 1949 ) emphasized .    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ can a spectral line be considered as a measure of a `` proper time '' ( @xmath37 ) @xmath38 ( @xmath39 ) , ( if one takes into consideration regions of cosmic dimensions ) ?",
    "is there such a thing as a natural object which incorporates the `` natural - measuring - stick '' independently of its position in four - dimensional space ?",
    "the affirmation of this question made the invention of the general theory of relativity    psychologically    possible ; however this supposition is logically not necessary . for the construction of the present theory of relativity",
    "the following is essential :    \\(1 ) physical things are described by continuous functions , field - variables of four co - ordinates . as long as the topological connection is preserved , these latter can be freely chosen .",
