    "the electronic structure of nanoparticles define their electrical , chemical and optical properties .",
    "hence , investigating these forms the basis for developing new applications in nanotechnology .",
    "a comprehensive understanding of the various possibilities to modify the electronic structure of a particle is required when aiming to tailor compounds for specific applications .",
    "research in this area can advance , for instance , the development of electron photoemitters@xcite or nano - electronics.@xcite    diamondoids are perfectly size- and shape - selectable , hydrogen passivated , _ _",
    "sp__@xmath0-hybridized carbon nanostructures.@xcite as such , they are an ideal class of particles for the study of effects induced by manipulation of geometry and chemical composition on the electronic structure in nanoscale systems . in addition , functionalization of these particles presents another possibility to tune their electronic structure.@xcite apart from the exploration of their existence in crude oil,@xcite continuous improvements in the field of synthesis of diamondoids@xcite have led to a rise in their popularity during the last ten years .",
    "diamondoids are of interest for the oil industry@xcite and environmental protection,@xcite and are also used for medicinal applications,@xcite among others .",
    "of particular interest in nanoparticles is the size - dependence of their electronic structure,@xcite often referred to in recent literature@xcite as quantum confinement ( qc ) effects .",
    "as they are perfectly size - selectable , diamondoids enjoy great popularity in the investigation of such effects.@xcite    recently , schreiner _",
    "_ synthesized diamondoid particles with extraordinary long cc - bonds.@xcite except for a study on the smallest@xcite singly bonded particle , their electronic structure have not been investigated . to our knowledge",
    "this is the case also for such particles connected with cc - double - bonds,@xcite for which results for only one compound have been reported in the literature.@xcite the present work deals with the valence electronic structure of such singly and doubly bonded diamondoid particles .",
    "the idea to combine lower diamondoids@xcite is comparable to a modular design principle .",
    "it is motivated by the question whether such a combination of lower diamondoids can imitate the electronic properties of larger , pristine diamondoids .",
    "we utilized photoelectron spectroscopy ( pes ) for all measurements in this work .",
    "a scienta ses-2002 hemispherical electron analyzer was used .",
    "the samples in the spectrometer focus region were ionized at @xmath1ev with a he - lamp ( specs uvs 10/35 ) .",
    "a resistively heated oven was used to bring the samples into the gas phase , see table  [ tab : experimental_parameters ] for an overview of the various samples and the experimental parameters . while the ambient chamber pressure was in the mid @xmath2 mbar range , chamber pressures during measurements",
    "were always kept constant in the mid @xmath3 mbar range . to calibrate the spectrometer energy scale , and to test the resolution ,",
    "xe gas ( air liquide , 99.995% purity ) was used .",
    "the experimental resolution was @xmath4mev for all samples .",
    ".[tab : experimental_parameters ] experimental parameters used for the measurements in this work .",
    "vaporization temperatures are given for ambient chamber pressures in the mid @xmath2 mbar range . [ cols=\"^,<,^ \" , ]",
    "we have studied the valence electronic structure of diamondoid particles . the influence of the bonding partners and the types of connecting bond have been investigated . for singly bonded particles",
    ", the central cc - bond has only little impact on the energy levels of the dimers under consideration .",
    "moreover , we observe that a combination of the bonding partner orbitals describes the overall electronic structure well",
    ". a consequence of this combination process can be seen through an analysis of the particle ips . while for the homo - dimers we measure ips well below the corresponding monomers , the change of ips for hetero - dimers strongly depends on the particle composition .",
    "qc effects can be seen for the homo - dimer ips but seem to be nearly absent for ips of hetero - dimers .",
    "dft computations show symmetrically distributed valence orbitals for dimers with equal bonding partners . as in pristine diamondoids ,",
    "the homos are delocalized over the entire molecule . in hetero - dimers , the constituent orbitals are asymmetrically distributed .",
    "the homo tends to be localized to the larger bonding partner due to its lower ip .",
    "hence the overall ip resembles that of the larger bonding partner , and qc effects are less pronounced .    for doubly bonded particles ,",
    "the cc - double - bond has a clear and identifiable impact on the electronic structure .",
    "it appears as an isolated electronic feature with vibrational fine - structure at the ionization onset in the photoelectron spectra .",
    "the ips vary only slightly with the size of the constituents .",
    "computations show a strong localization of the homo to the cc - double - bond and the influence on the homo of the surrounding carbon atoms is restricted to screening .",
    "the homo-1 is delocalized over the @xmath5-bonds of the diamondoid cage structures and can be identified as a distinct shoulder in the photoelectron spectra .",
    "to further understand the influence of the combination of single diamondoids to larger particles on the electronic structure of the resulting system , more studies on this class of compounds are highly desirable .",
    "using singly bonded particles enables researchers to imitate the electronic properties of higher diamondoids , thereby circumventing the problem of extremely low synthesis / isolation yields for higher diamondoids .",
    "furthermore , the study of singly bonded dimers is an interesting route to gain insight into the role of dispersive forces on the long central cc - bonds .",
    "the further investigation of doubly bonded particles assists the comprehension of carbon nanostructures with both _ _ sp__@xmath0- and _ _",
    "sp__@xmath6-hybridized moieties .",
    "besides the already explored parameters size , shape , and functionalization , the combination of pristine diamondoids into particles with different bonding situations opens a completely new degree of freedom to explore with regards to electronic structure and band gap tuning .",
