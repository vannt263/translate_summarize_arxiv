    "the object of our interest in this paper is a spinless quantum particle living in a layer of a fixed width @xmath0 with the dirichlet boundary conditions and interacting with a finite number of point perturbations .",
    "an obvious motivation for this problem is to find a description for an electron in a semiconductor layer with impurities .",
    "however , such physical systems are in reality rather complicated objects which involve a crystal lattice with some alien atoms and an electron gas , so one has to ask first whether such a simple model can reproduce the basic features known from experiments .",
    "it is well known that an electron in an ideally pure bulk semiconductor material can be modeled as a free particle with an effective mass @xmath1 which characterizes the relation between the energy and quasi - momentum at the fermi level .",
    "properties of the crystalline structure are thus expressed through a single material constant , which may be very different from the `` bare '' mass  recall that for gaas we have @xmath2 .",
    "there are two other assumptions in the `` free '' part of the model .",
    "the first is its one - particle character which neglects the interactions between the electrons .",
    "there are situations where the repulsion plays an important role , such as the coulomb blockade in quantum wires . on the other hand",
    ", the one - electron model is known to work when the electron - gas density is sufficiently low .",
    "another assumption is the neglection of spin which is also not entirely trivial ; recall that spin - dependent effects in nanostructures have been studied recently  see @xcite and references therein . in most situations , however , spinless electrons are a reasonable approximation",
    ".    the next question concerns the way in which we model the impurities . using again a certain idealization",
    ", we describe them by point interactions .",
    "this method proved rather useful in the last two decades and gave rise to numerous solvable models ; our aim here is to add one more class to this family .",
    "intuitively point interactions are understood as sharply localized potentials , but it is known that a sophisticated coupling constant renormalization is required to give this concept meaning in terms of a limit of scaled potentials ( * ? ? ?",
    "i.1 , i.5 ) .",
    "mathematically such operators can be handled since they differ from the free hamiltonian @xmath3 just by a change of the boundary conditions at the interaction sites .",
    "however , the counterintuitive features of three - dimensional point interactions are reflected both in the slow way in which they found their place in the theory and in the fact that the parameters appearing in these conditions can not be interpreted as @xmath4 potential coupling constants but rather as the inverse scattering lengths corresponding to the point `` obstacles ''  cf .",
    "i.3 ) .    scores of papers discussing point - interaction models in the euclidean space , both for particles otherwise free or with a background regular potential , are summarized in the monograph @xcite . only in the last decade",
    "the attention shifted to systems with point interactions restricted to a certain region of configuration space ; the reason clearly was a wide collection of new physical phenomena observed in such spatially restricted systems , mostly mesoscopic objects , but also electromagnetic waveguides , photonic crystals , etc .",
    " see @xcite . here ,",
    "too , point - interaction hamiltonians proved as a useful tool and yielded some unexpected results such as the existence of a chaotic behaviour in systems whose classical counterparts are integrable @xcite .    today",
    "there are many papers treating point interaction in restricted areas ; a bibliography is given in the introduction of @xcite .",
    "they typically put emphasis on the description of a specific model rather than a proper handling of the point interaction . among few existing rigorous treatments of the problem",
    "it is the paper @xcite which motivates the present study analyzing point interactions in an infinite planar strip with dirichlet boundary conditions , together with similar systems .",
    "there are two ways in which the results can be generalized to dimension three .",
    "one is a straight dirichlet tube in @xmath5 with a fixed compact cross section discussed in @xcite ; it is a straightforward extension , apart of a different way of computing the regularized green s function .    in the present paper we are going to study a less trivial generalization , with point interactions situated in a flat layer with a dirichlet boundary .",
    "the free system allows here again a separation of variables , so the free resolvent kernel and all the quantities derived from it such as eigenfunctions , etc .",
    ", can be written by means of explicitly given series ( in this sense models considered here are little `` less solvable '' than those in the full space when such quantities can be written in terms of elementary or special functions ) .",
    "although the model description is simple , it covers many different situations . for the sake of brevity",
    "we restrict ourselves in this paper to systems with a finite number of point perturbations in absence of a background potential leaving other cases to a sequel .",
    "we make an exception , however , by devoting a separate section to the case when the particle is under influence of a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to the layer . the spectrum of the unperturbed system is then changed completely consisting of infinitely degenerate eigenvalues which are sums of the landau levels and the transverse eigenvalues ; for `` rational '' combinations of parameters different landau levels may lead to the same eigenvalue .",
    "a finite number of point perturbations then gives rise to a nontrivial discrete spectrum .",
    "let us describe briefly the contents .",
    "the next section is devoted to the case of a single perturbation .",
    "we start from the definition of the point - interaction hamiltonian by means of boundary conditions coupling generalized boundary values . after that we use krein s formula to derive the explicit expression for the resolvent",
    "; it involves the regularized green s function which is given by a specific series as mentioned above  see ( [ finalxi ] ) .",
    "in section  2.4 we use this result to analyze spectral properties of such hamiltonians .",
    "the bound state energies are given by the implicit equation ( [ point ] ) , and it is just the limits of strong and weak coupling where we are able to write the explicit expressions for the leading term of the asymptotics . in both the extreme cases the eigenvalue behavior can be easily understood : in the strong - coupling situation it goes to @xmath6 in the same way as if there were no boundaries because the corresponding eigenfunction is strongly localized , while in the weak - coupling case the eigenvalue approaches the threshold of the essential spectrum and the wavefunction is dominated transversally by the lowest mode .",
    "we also find that the eigenvalue decreases with the distance from the layer boundary . in the last part of section  2",
    "we shall discuss the scattering in the presence of a perturbation .",
    "if there is a single point interaction , we can employ the symmetry of the problem with respect to rotation around the axis passing through the perturbation and perpendicular to the layer .",
    "the partial wave decomposition in the `` longitudinal '' coordinates shows that the only nontrivial contribution to the scattering comes from the s - wave , i.e. from states with the orbital momentum @xmath7 . within this subspace",
    ", the scattering problem is reduced to transitions between transverse modes ; the final s - matrix then describes a coupling of the `` open '' channels , i.e. the transverse modes with the energies lower than that of the incoming spherical wave .",
    "we also derive the on - shell scattering operator which maps the incoming wave vector and transverse mode into the outgoing ones ; the advantage of this approach is that it does employ the symmetry and allows for a generalization to the case with multiple perturbations .",
    "section  3 extends the described analysis to any finite number @xmath8 of point perturbations .",
    "the technique remains the same , and since the difference between the two resolvents is of rank @xmath8 , the essential and absolutely continuous spectra are again preserved . on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of the discrete spectrum becomes more complicated .",
    "there are @xmath9 eigenvalues , where @xmath10 , which are found by solving the implicit equation @xmath11 with the @xmath12 matrix @xmath13 given by ( [ lambda ] ) .",
    "the number @xmath9 depends on the coupling strength . in the strong coupling limit there",
    "exist exactly @xmath8 eigenvalues having the same asymptotic behavior as in the one - center case . on the other hand , for weak coupling we find only one eigenvalue approaching the threshold of the essential spectrum",
    "; in this sense our system exhibits a behavior typical for all weakly coupled schrdinger operators .",
    "a new feature for systems with @xmath14 is that they can posses eigenvalues embedded in the essential spectrum .",
    "this is possible , e.g. , when the point perturbations are placed symmetrically with respect to the layer axis and have the same ( sufficiently strong ) coupling : the corresponding eigenfunction can not then contain contributions from transverse modes with the energy equal or smaller than this eigenvalue .",
    "we will show that this is true for embedded eigenvalues generally : their eigenvectors have to be orthogonal to the subspace spanned by the `` lower '' transverse modes . for @xmath15",
    "the system exhibits no longer a rotational symmetry , hence we can not employ the partial - wave decomposition to describe the scattering .",
    "however , the second approach mentioned above is applicable here and we can derive again the on - shell scattering operator . it is similar to that of the one - centre case differing just by replacement of a single regularized green s function by a sum of the elements of the matrix @xmath13  see ( [ n on - shell ] ) .",
    "section  4 deals with the situation when the layer is placed into a homogeneous magnetic field perpendicular to its boundary .",
    "the krein s formula is applicable but the free resolvent is substantially different from the non - magnetic case ; this is reflected in the form of the essential spectrum which now consist the `` sum '' of the landau levels and the transverse mode energies ; it , of course , is preserved by a finite number of point perturbations . if there is a single perturbation we get exactly one eigenvalue in each spectral gap , i.e. between any two neighboring levels . in the strong and weak coupling limits it approaches the upper and lower endpoint of corresponding `` free '' gap , respectively . only for the lowest gap we find a different behavior in the strong - coupling limit case ;",
    "the eigenvalue goes to @xmath6 with the same asymptotics as in the non - magnetic case .",
    "finally we present a generalization to the case of @xmath8 point interactions analogous to the considerations of section  3 .",
    "consider an infinite layer @xmath16 $ ] with the coordinates denoted as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 and @xmath19 $ ] .",
    "we consider a single spinless nonrelativistic particle confined to @xmath20 .",
    "since the actual values of physical constants are not essential throughout the paper , we put @xmath21 and suppose that the free motion of the particle is governed by the dirichlet laplacian @xmath22 .",
    "recall that this operator can be defined for rather general domains in @xmath23 as the friedrichs extension of an appropriate quadratic form ( * ? ? ?",
    "xiii.15 ) .",
    "however , since the boundary of @xmath24 is consists of two disjoint planes and has therefore the segment property , the operator acts simply as @xmath25 on the domain of all @xmath26 of the local sobolev space @xmath27 which satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath28 for all @xmath29  see again ( * ? ? ?",
    "xiii.15 ) .",
    "we will make use of the fact that the  longitudinal \" and  transverse \" variables decouple in the free system .",
    "the state hilbert space of our problem can be then decomposed into traverse modes , @xmath30 , because the functions @xmath31 form an orthonormal basis in @xmath32)$ ] .",
    "the free hamiltonian can be correspondingly written in the form of a direct sum , @xmath33 since the resolvent @xmath34 of the two - dimensional laplacian is known explicitly , the above decomposition yields in turn the free resolvent kernel @xmath35 where @xmath36 .      our first goal is to construct a one - center perturbation supported by a point @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "this can be done in a standard way @xcite .",
    "we restrict @xmath22 to functions which vanish in a neighborhood of @xmath40 ; the operator obtained in this way is symmetric but not self - adjoint and we look for the perturbed one among its self - adjoint extensions . since the restriction has deficiency indices @xmath41 , the family of extensions is by the standard von neumann theory ( * ? ? ?",
    "x.1 ) characterized by a single parameter .",
    "what is equally important is that the perturbation is local , and therefore we can characterize the extensions by the usual boundary condition derived in ( * ? ? ?",
    "i.1 ) for point interactions in @xmath5 .",
    "we introduce the generalized boundary values , @xmath42 and require @xmath43 for a fixed @xmath44 this leads to the self - adjoint operator @xmath45 acting as @xmath46 for @xmath47 on the domain @xmath48 in @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is , of course , understood in the sense of distributions .",
    "the family of self - adjoint extension includes also case which is formally given by @xmath51 , which means @xmath52 . it is easy to see that the corresponding @xmath45 is nothing else than the free hamiltonian @xmath3 .      as usual",
    "the spectral properties of the operator @xmath53 can be studied using its resolvent .",
    "since @xmath45 and @xmath3 have a common restriction with deficiency indices @xmath41 , the kernel of the full resolvent can be obtained by means of the krein s formula ( * ? ? ?",

    "the dimension of the configuration space is decisive . while for two - dimensional system the scaling amounts to logarithmic shift of the function @xmath70 as shown in @xcite , in three dimension the transformation is multiplicative",

    "this means , in particular , that the singularities of the resolvent which we will discuss below using equation ( [ point ] ) are related as follows : @xmath91 without loss of generality we put therefore @xmath92 in the rest of this and the next section .",
    "the explicit form of the resolvent ( [ krein ] ) allows us to derive information about the spectrum .",
    "since its difference from @xmath34 is a rank one operator , the essential spectrum remains by weyl s theorem ( * ? ? ?",
