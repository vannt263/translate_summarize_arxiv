    "ultra - cold atoms in optical lattices make possible detailed studies of basic condensed matter systems @xcite .",
    "while several applications have been envisaged ranging from high @xmath0 superconductivity @xcite , disordered systems @xcite , spin models @xcite or novel quantum magnets @xcite - for a review , see @xcite - the most basic model realized in such a setting is the bose - hubbard model ( bhm ) @xcite , which still defies an exact analytical description while exhibiting a nontrivial quantum phase transition @xcite between a superfluid state and an insulator .",
    "experiments , both three - dimensional @xcite and one - dimensional ( 1d ) @xcite , performed in additional confining atomic traps , led to realization of an inhomogeneous finite model .",
    "still , from the theoretical perspective , the infinite system is the most challenging case . as in experiments ,",
    "the typical numerical studies deal with finite size systems , with a possible extrapolation to infinite systems at the end .",
    "such an extrapolation is always delicate , especially in the vicinity of the phase transition .",
    "even simple quantities like the precise location of the phase transition point are still controversial , see below .    in the absence of an exact analytical result",
    ", one must rely on approximate results , such as the bethe ansatz  @xcite or numerical studies , which are roughly of three different types : exact diagonalization for finite systems - limited to very small systems and thus unable to extrapolate to the infinite size - , quantum monte - carlo ( qmc ) methods and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) methods @xcite .",
    "the time evolving block decimation ( tebd ) algorithm @xcite is a novel variant of the dmrg method which can provide results for the temporal dynamics , but also for the eigenstates using imaginary time evolution .",
    "recently , it has been extended to 1d lattice systems with nearest - neighbor interactions _ of infinite size _",
    "it has been successfully tested on the integrable ising model .",
    "it is yet to be seen whether really difficult problems can be attacked by this algorithm .",
    "the present work provides a partial answer to this question by addressing the challenging problem of the quantum phase transition of the bhm .",
    "the hamiltonian of the bhm , in dimensionless variables , reads @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the number of sites .",
    "we put it finite just for the introduction , as we shall consider @xmath3 for the actual calculation .",
    "@xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath6 , while @xmath7 .",
    "the total number of atoms @xmath8 commutes with the hamiltonian . in the thermodynamic limit of infinite systems , it is convenient to consider the particle density @xmath9 and the chemical potential @xmath10    two parameters describe the model : the tunnelling rate @xmath11 and the interaction strength @xmath12 .",
    "since physics of the bhm depends on the @xmath13 ratio only , we set @xmath14 for convenience .",
    "the behaviour of the system as @xmath13 is varied has been extensively discussed in a number of papers , see  @xcite , thus we mention the most relevant details only .",
    "the mott insulator phase occurs at integer occupation of sites for sufficiently small tunnelling . within the mott insulator regime , the density stays constant - the system is not compressible .",
    "typically , at the phase boundary , the density changes and the superfluid regime is reached via a standard quantum phase transition .",
    "the interesting situation occurs when the phase transition is reached via a path of a constant integer density @xmath15 .",
    "the model belongs then to the universality class of the @xmath16 model @xcite and the phase transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) @xcite type .    in the present paper",
    ", we determine very accurately the @xmath11 value at which the kt transition occurs for @xmath17 this is a difficult task previously addressed using different methods yielding quite different results . the mean field theory @xcite yields @xmath18 .",
    "the bethe ansatz allows for an analytical albeit approximate treatment@xcite giving @xmath19 .",
    "early numerical values obtained via qmc @xcite as well as renormalization group arguments @xcite yielded a quite different value @xmath20 .",
    "later numerical approaches came closer to the bethe ansatz result .",
    "in particular , kashurnikov et al .",
    "@xcite found @xmath21 in a qmc study while an exact diagonalization for @xmath22 combined with renormalization group by the same group @xcite yields @xmath23 .",
    "other qmc approach @xcite gave @xmath24 .",
    "earlier diagonalization results  @xcite gave @xmath25 .",
    "high order perturbative expansion suggests @xmath26 @xcite in an excellent agreement with finite dmrg treatment @xcite yielding essentially the same result . yet",
    "other dmrg approaches gave interestingly different results .",
    "the periodic boundary conditions dmrg @xcite gave @xmath27 while the infinite size dmrg with periodic boundaries gave @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the same authors attempted a finite size dmrg with open boundary conditions ( yielding a better convergence ) giving @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the current algorithms disagree on the the value of @xmath30 this is partially due to logarithmic finite - size effects close to the critical point of the kt transition @xcite . the accurate determination of @xmath31 is thus an ideal testbed for algorithms dealing with infinite systems .",
    "the approach @xcite used is an infinite variant of the tebd algorithm  @xcite .",
    "it belongs to a rapidly developing class of methods which utilise the understanding of quantum entanglement in complex systems to facilitate effective simulations of many - body quantum systems .",
    "all these methods have some links ( see discussion in @xcite ) with the dmrg algorithms @xcite extending them either to time evolution @xcite and to many dimensional systems @xcite ) a particularly interesting variant of the tebd approach assumes translational invariance of the wavefunction and enables a treatment of explicitly infinite systems @xcite . while we refer the reader to original papers for details , we sketch here the main idea .",
    "the bhm hamiltonian involves only nearest - neighbor interactions and can thus be written as a sum over consecutive sites @xmath6 of reduced hamiltonians",
    "@xmath32 each site is described by a hilbert space of dimension @xmath33 we follow the imaginary time evolution , i.e. , compute ( we assume @xmath34 in the whole paper ) |()=. [ psitau ] for large @xmath35 and a generic initial guess @xmath36 such a procedure should yield a good approximation of the ground state provided there is a gap in the spectrum of the system .",
    "we assume translational invariance of our system , i.e. , @xmath37 s does not depend on site @xmath6 .",
    "moreover we restrict ourselves to wavefunctions that are invariant under shifts by one lattice spacing .",
    "the time evolution proceeds in the following way .",
    "the normalized wave function is schmidt decomposed at site @xmath6 as |=_=1^_^(r )    @xmath38 states are an orthonormal set and @xmath39 for global normalization .",
    "as discussed in @xcite , for low lying states , the @xmath40 values decrease rapidly , so that a good approximation of the state is obtained keeping only the few largest @xmath41 .",
    "the two consecutive left or right sub lattices states are related via tensors @xmath42 as follows : |_^(r+1)&= & _",
    "= 1^ _ i=1^d_^(r)_i^(r+1 ) |_^(r)|i^(r+1),|_^(r)&= & _",
    "= 1^ _ i=1^d_i^(r+1)_^(r+1 ) |i^(r)|_^(r+1 ) ; [ expansion ] where @xmath43 is an orthonormal basis spanning the local hilbert space at site @xmath6 ( e.g. the fock basis for the bhm ) . in that way one obtains a so - called matrix product state ( mps ) @xcite representation of @xmath44 .",
    "the imaginary time evolution operation can be expressed as a product of elementary two - site evolution operators u^(r , r+1 ) = ) , t 1 ; using the suzuki - trotter decomposition @xcite .",
    "now the crucial observation is that , for translationally invariant @xmath45 , all @xmath42 and @xmath46 are independent of @xmath6 .",
    "the application of a two - site gate @xmath47 has two effects :    it breaks for a moment the translational invariance ( since sites @xmath6 and @xmath48 are updated only ) ;    the resulting vector is not longer a mps .",
    "the latter is taken care of by a singular value decomposition of the resulting matrix and retaining only the @xmath49 largest eigenvalues ( and corresponding vectors ) - see @xcite for details and @xcite for a graphical representation .",
    "this approximation brings the vector back into the mps form .",
    "the modified @xmath42 s , @xmath46 s are then updated for all the sites  the translational invariance is restored .",
    "it is worth stressing that the repetition of this procedure allows one to act on two consecutive sites only , taking proper care of local updates of appropriate tensors . in the limit @xmath50 and",
    "@xmath51 the exact evolution is obtained . the error introduced by finiteness of @xmath52",
    "is easily controlled ( it varies as a power of @xmath52 depending on the order of the suzuki - trotter decomposition ) while the strength of the method is that the number @xmath49 of not too small @xmath53 values remains reasonably small . as shown in @xcite , to facilitate convergence , one can take successively smaller and smaller time steps . in the following we use a simple second order trotter expansion ( which , according to our experience , seems to be the most efficient in imaginary time evolution when time steps are decreased ) .",
    "to make the infinite - tebd method work , additional parameters have to be adjusted .",
    "one of them is the maximal allowed occupation @xmath54 at a given site ( giving the dimension of the hilbert space at each site , @xmath55 ) . in earlier dmrg calculations for mean unit occupancy typically @xmath56 or @xmath57 was used @xcite .",
    "we take @xmath57 , although the difference with @xmath56 is small .",
    "the second important cutoff parameter is the restriction on @xmath49 , the number of @xmath53 values retained at each step .",
    "this value can be quite small deep in the mott insulator region , it has to be taken painfully large close to the kt transitions .",
    "this is costly since the execution time scales as @xmath58  @xcite .",
    "a satisfactory convergence of the correlation function c(s ) = < _ s+r^_r > requires @xmath49 of the order of one hundred .",
    "such correlation functions define the phase coherence of the condensate , we shall use them to determine the transition point .    in the mott regime ,",
    "the system has a finite gap , which implies that @xmath44 , eq .",
    "( [ psitau ] ) , converges exponentially fast at long times to the ground state , at a rate proportional to the energy gap .",
    "this is indeed what we numerically observe , with exponential convergence of the energy too .",
    "thus , gor a given time step we perform the imaginary time evolution until the slope of the energy curve w.r.t .",
    "imaginary time reaches a desired small threshold .",
    "then the time step is decreased by a factor 2 and the procedure repeated until a computer accuracy limit for the time step is reached .",
    "while this procedure may not be optimal for speed , it assures the convergence of the results obtained .",
    "it seems quite surprising that our results both for the energy and for the correlation function , fig .",
    "[ corchi ] , converge well even in the superfluid regime where the gap in the excitation spectrum should vanish .",
    "we indeed observe such a convergence , although apparently not fully exponential .",
    "we presently have no clear explanation of this behavior , which is under study .",
    "a plausible cause is the enforcement of translational invariance at each step of the algorithm .",
    "that restricts the spanned hilbert space to the translationally invariant subspace killing , e.g. , the possible excitations of low - frequency bogolyubov modes in the superfluid regime .",
    "we carefully checked that all results presented in this paper are converged with respect to a modification of the ( small ) time step and an increase of @xmath59     in the superfluid phase regime , @xmath60 .",
    "solid line @xmath61 , dashed @xmath62 while the dots and the underlying thin solid line correspond to @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "the last two sets almost coincide indicating the convergence with respect to @xmath49 .",
    "the linear behaviour in this log - log plot proves that the correlation function decays algebraically . ]",
    "the convergence of the long - range correlation functions is of particular importance . as discussed in @xcite , at integer density",
    ", it should exhibit a power law @xmath65 for large @xmath66 , on the superfluid side with @xmath67 increasing up to @xmath68 when the kt transition is approached .",
    "this is a behaviour typical for a luttinger liquid characterising low energy excitations in the superfluid state .",
    "[ correl ] reveals that it is indeed the case .",
    "as expected , the power law behaviour no longer holds on the mott side of the transition . here , deep in the mott regime , an exponential decay of correlations is observed .     for different values of @xmath11 on a double logarithmic scale . from bottom to top",
    ": @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath70 curve in the deep mott regime regime corresponds to a mott insulator .",
    "as expected it resembles an exponential . in the deep superfluid regime ,",
    "the power law is very well obeyed , that allows for accurate fits .",
    "close to the transition , even on the mott side , @xmath71 shows transient behaviour for small @xmath66 , then a region of an approximate power law behaviour , then for very large @xmath66 an exponential tail is expected in the mott regime . when approaching the critical point on the mott side , this exponential region takes place at larger and larger @xmath72 in the range @xmath73 shown in this plot , it is not visible expect for the lowest @xmath70 curve .",
    "the @xmath74 curve , the closest one to the critical curve @xmath75 is shown by a dashed line . ]",
    ".[tab ] the location of the critical point @xmath76 estimated from different ranges of @xmath66 value in the correlation function @xmath71 .",
    "the second column reproduces fits of @xcite , the third column yields present results . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     to estimate the kt transition point , a special case must be paid to keep a constant unit density .",
    "while for a finite system the particle number conservation can be explicitly used to keep the density fixed this is not the case for the infinite version of the code @xcite . instead",
    ", a chemical potential , @xmath77 , must be used and adjusted to keep a contant desided density .",
    "our simulations were performed for different values of @xmath77 and the correlation functions shown ( and used later to extract the transition point ) were obtained for @xmath15 well within @xmath78 $ ] interval . to obtain slopes at @xmath79 an appropriate interpolation of the results has been used .",
    "we observed that the power law coefficient in that interval changed weakly , the possible error in the transition point evaluation is included in the estimates given below .",
    "the correlation functions @xmath71 obtained at different @xmath11 values are fitted with a power law on the superfluid side of the transition point . since in the mott regime",
    "the behaviour of the correlation function hardly resembles a power law ( see fig .",
    "[ correl ] ) , we make fits in different ranges of @xmath66 exactly following the procedure of kehner et al  @xcite .",
    "the obtained slopes ( as a function of @xmath11 ) are interpolated to yield the transition point @xmath31 .",
    "these points are collected in table i for different @xmath66 intervals . for comparison",
    "we reproduce also the results of @xcite . while earlier dmrg results seem to be quite sensitive to the range of @xmath66 values , our fits yield much closer and mutually consistent results .",
    "the comparison presented shows the power and accuracy of the infinite tebd algorithm .",
    "clearly , fits for small @xmath66 lead to misleading results , @xmath71 for @xmath66 below few tens ( say 30 ) does not yet behave in the asymptotic power law way even in the superfluid regime .",
    "given the accuracy of the method we can extend the evaluation of @xmath71 to much larger @xmath66 values , yielding global fits reported at the bottom of table i. note that those fits are in decent agreement with moderate @xmath66 values of the order of 50 .",
    "we cannnot , however , extend the calculation of @xmath71 to much larger @xmath66 values of the order of several thousands or more due to the numerical precision .",
    "the kt transition point at unit density should be safely close to the value given by the last fit @xmath80 where the ( conservative ) estimate of the error is coming from the comparison with other fits .",
    "while the obtained value is quite close to that reported previously @xcite , even our conservative error estimate makes the result more accurate by one order of magnitude .",
    "quite a similar approach can be used for a double occupancy case @xmath81 . here , using the very same method",
    ", we obtain a benchmark value @xmath82 . for that calculation",
    "the possible maximal occupancy of each site had to be larger or equal to 6 .",
    "we have checked by a comparison of selected runs with those for even larger occupancy that the assumed maximal occupation is sufficient for the convergence .",
    "to summarize , we have shown that the infinite tebd algorithm @xcite may be efficiently applied to nontrivial challenging problems such as the determination of the kt critical point in the bhm .",
    "the accuracy is superior to that obtained by the standard dmrg approach",
    ". surprisingly , converged results are also obtained in the superfluid regime .",
    "the restriction of the algorithm to the translationally invariant subspace , while justified for present ground state studies , may restrict the application of the method @xcite to the real time evolution . there",
    "it could allow to treat `` exactly '' the dynamics of the quantum phase transition .",
    "work in this direction is in progress .",
