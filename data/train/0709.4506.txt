    "the system , as in @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , consists of @xmath0 relays assisting the transmitter and the receiver in the half - duplex mode , i.e. in each time , the relays can either transmit or receive .",
    "the channels between each two node is assumed to be quasi - static flat rayleigh - fading , i.e. the channel gains remain constant during a block of transmission and changes independently from one block to another .",
    "however , we assume that there is no direct link between the transmitter and the receiver .",
    "this assumption is reasonable when the transmitter and the receiver are far from each other or when the receiver is supposed to have connection with just the relay nodes to avoid the complexity of the network . as in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "each node is assumed to know the state of its backward channel and , moreover , the receiver is supposed to know the equivalent channel gain from the transmitter to the receiver .",
    "no feedback to the transmitting node is permitted .",
    "all nodes have the same power constraint .",
    "also , we assume that a capacity achieving gaussian random codebook can be generated at each node of the network .",
    "hence , the code design problem is not considered in this paper .",
    "in the proposed scheme , the entire block of transmission is divided into @xmath1 sub - blocks .",
    "each sub - block consists of @xmath0 slots .",
    "each slot has @xmath2 symbols .",
    "hence , the entire block consists of @xmath3 symbols . in order to transmit a message @xmath4",
    ", the transmitter selects the corresponding codeword of a gaussian random codebook consisting of @xmath5 codewords of length @xmath6 and transmits the codeword during the first @xmath7 slots . in each sub - block",
    ", each relay receives the signal in one of the slots and transmits the received signal in the next slot .",
    "so , each relay is off in @xmath8 of time .",
    "more precisely , in the @xmath9 slot of the @xmath10the sub - block ( @xmath11 ) , the @xmath9th relay receives the signals the transmitter is sending , and amplifies and forwards it to the receiver in the next slot .",
    "the receiver starts receiving the signal from the second slot . after receiving the last slot ( @xmath12th slot ) signal , the receiver decodes the transmitted message by using the signal of @xmath7 slot received from @xmath0 relays .",
    "it will be shown in the next section that the equivalent point - to - point channel from the transmitter to the receiver would act as a lower - triangular mimo channel .",
    "in this section , we show that the proposed method achieves the optimum achievable diversity - multiplexing curve . first , according to the cut - set bound theorem @xcite , the point - to - point capacity of the uplink channel ( the channel from the transmitter to the relays ) is an upper - bound for the capacity of this system .",
    "accordingly , the diversity - multiplexing curve of a @xmath13 simo system which is a straight line from multiplexing gain @xmath14 to the diversity gain @xmath0 is an upper - bound for the diversity - multiplexing curve of our system . in this section",
    ", we prove that the tradeoff curve of the proposed method achieves the upper - bound and thus , it is optimum .",
    "first , we prove the statement for the case that there is no link between the relays .",
    "next , we prove the statement for the general case .",
    "assume , the link gain between the @xmath9th relay and the transmitter and the @xmath9th relay and the receiver are @xmath15 and @xmath16 , respectively .",
    "furthermore , assume that there is no link between the relays .",
    "accordingly , at the @xmath9th relay we have @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the received signal vector of the @xmath9th relay , @xmath19 is the transmitter signal vector and @xmath20 is the noise vector of the channel . at the receiver side",
    ", we have @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the transmitted signal vector of the @xmath9th relay , @xmath23 is the received signal vector at the receiver side and @xmath24 is the noise vector of the downlink channel .",
    "the output power constraint @xmath25 holds at the transmitter and relays side . to obtain the dm tradeoff curve of the proposed scheme",
    ", we are looking for the end - to - end probability of outage from the rate @xmath26 , as @xmath27 goes to infinity .",
    "assume a half - duplex parallel relay scenario with @xmath0 no interfering relays .",
    "the proposed sm scheme achieves the diversity gain @xmath28 which achieves the optimum achievable dm tradeoff curve @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "let us define @xmath31 as the signal / noise transmitted / received by the transmitter / relay / receiver to the @xmath9th relay / receiver in the @xmath9th slot of the @xmath10th sub - block .",

    "( a ) follows from the fact that @xmath41 , ( b ) and ( d ) follow from the union bound inequality , ( c ) follows from the fact that @xmath42 and the pdf distribution of the rayleigh - fading parameter near zero , and ( e ) follows from the fact that the product of two independent rayleigh - fading parameters behave as a rayleigh - fading parameter near zero .",
    "( [ eq : sbch_ni ] ) shows that each sub - channel s tradeoff curve performs as a single - antenna point - to - point channel .    defining @xmath43",
    "as the random variable showing the rate of the @xmath9th sub - channel consisting of the transmitter , the @xmath9th relay , and the receiver in terms of @xmath27 , the outage event of the entire channel from the @xmath37 , the event @xmath44 , is equal to @xmath45 assuming @xmath46 , we have @xmath47 @xmath48 is known by ( [ eq : sbch_ni ] ) . defining the region @xmath49 as @xmath50 it is easy to check that all the vectors @xmath51 that result in the outage event almost surely lie in @xmath49 .",

    "first of all , by taking derivative of ( [ eq : cdf_ni ] ) with respect to @xmath60 , it is easy to see that the probability density function of @xmath61 behaves the same as the probability function in ( [ eq : cdf_ni ] ) , i.e. @xmath62 .",
    "hence , the outage probability is equal to @xmath63 here , ( a ) follows from the fact that @xmath49 is a fixed bounded region whose volume is independent of @xmath27 . on the other hand , by continuity of @xmath64 over @xmath61 , we have @xmath65 which combining with ( [ eq : r_ub_ni ] ) , results into @xmath66 . defining @xmath67 , we have to solve the following linear programming optimization problem @xmath68 .",
    "notice that the region @xmath49 is defined by a set of linear inequality constraints . to solve the problem , we have @xmath69 here , ( a ) follows from the inequality constraint in ( [ eq : r_df_ni ] ) governing @xmath49 , and ( b ) follows from the fact that @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "_ remark - _ it is worth noting that as long as the graph @xmath83 whose vertices are the relay nodes and edges are the non interfering relay node pairs includes a hamiltonian cycle , that goes exactly one time through each vertex of the graph . ]",
    "the result of this subsection remains valid .      in the general case , an interference term due to the neighboring relay adds at the receiver antenna of each relay .",
    "@xmath84 where @xmath85 is the interference link gain between the @xmath9th and @xmath86th relays .",
    "hence , the amplification coefficient is bounded as @xmath87 . here , we observe that in the case that @xmath88 , the noise @xmath89 at the receiving side of the @xmath9th relay can be boosted at the receiving side of the next relay . hence , we bound the amplification coefficient as @xmath90 . in this way",
    ", it is guaranteed that the noise of relays are not boosted up through the system .",
    "this is at the expense working with the output power less than @xmath27 .",
    "on the other hand , we know that almost surely , for all values of @xmath91 .",
    "] @xmath92 .",
    "hence , almost surely we have @xmath93 . another change we make in this part",
