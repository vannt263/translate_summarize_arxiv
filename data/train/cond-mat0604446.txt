    "[ fig : comparison](b ) ) qd charge states",
    ". therefore in further discussion we shall ignore in particular the long time - scale component observed in the pl decay measurements .",
    "the results of cx - x correlation measurements provide direct evidence for the important role of single carrier capture in qd excitation .",
    "indeed , cx - x coincidences are registered only if the charge state of the dot changes between the correlated emission events .",
    "if the carriers were injected predominantly in pairs possessing no effective charge , changes in the charge state of the dot would be unlikely , resulting in cx - x coincidence rates much smaller than x - x or cx - cx autocorrelation count rates , in contrast with our experimental results .",
    "another argument for single carrier excitation comes from the strong asymmetry of the cx - x and xx - cx correlation histograms ( a similar result has been obtained by kiraz et al.@xcite on inas / gaas qds and chang et al.@xcite on ingaas / gaas qds with cw excitation ) .",
    "peaks at positive ( negative ) time delay in a cx - x histogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms](d ) ) represent detection of a neutral exciton photon after ( before ) charged exciton photon . in particular reexcitation of the quantum dot directly after the charged exciton recombination ( n = 1 peak ) requires a single carrier to be trapped , while three carriers are necessary for the opposite emission order ( n = @xmath29 ) . the much smaller probability of three trapping events following a single pulse results in smaller intensity of the n = @xmath29 peak than that of the n = 1 one .",
    "after several pulses the qd approaches a steady state with non - zero probabilities of finding the dot in a neutral or charged state , resulting in an intermediate asymptotic peak intensity .",
    "a similar explanation holds for the xx - cx crosscorrelation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms](f ) ) .",
    "as reported previously in respect of x emission from nonresonantly excited iii - v qds,@xcite we also observed the antibunching of photons emitted in n @xmath30 pulses : lower than average intensities of peaks at both sides of the central one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms](a ) ) .",
    "this indicates that excitation to x state is less probable when the dot is empty ( following an x photon emission ) than when it is in steady state condition .",
    "this difference between the steady state and empty ground state of the dot can be naturally explained in terms of the qd charge . in the case of xx autocorrelation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms](b ) ) the decrease of n  @xmath31 peaks is even more pronounced .",
    "this is because as many as four carriers are needed to repopulate the xx state . in the steady state",
    "the finite probability of the presence of a carrier in the quantum dot decreases the average number of carriers necessary to repopulate the radiative state in both cases ( x or xx ) .",
    "an explanation of the suppression of n @xmath32 peaks in xx - x crosscorrelation histogram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms](e ) ) may be obtained in the same spirit .",
    "the opposite conduct is observed in the charged exciton autocorrelation : n @xmath33 peaks are higher than n = 0 one ( fig .",
    "[ fig : histograms](c ) ) .",
    "this result is explained by the fact that after cx recombination the dot contains a single carrier , and two more carriers ( of opposite sign ) must be captured to repopulate the cx state .",
    "peaks far from n = 0 are less intense because the steady state involves non - zero probability of a neutral empty qd state , requiring three carriers to enable the qd to emit another cx photon .    in summary",
    ", we explain the observed memory effects in terms of the qd charge state variation caused by capture of single carriers by the qd . within our interpretation",
    "we would not expect any memory effects without single carrier capture : all n @xmath34 0 peaks would have the same intensity ( since @xmath35 ) .",
    "the above analysis allows us to make qualitative predictions concerning correlation experiments performed under continuous wave excitation .",
    "the suppression of x - x and xx - xx autocorrelation in the neighborhood of zero delay should produce a broadening of the antibunching dip in the case of cw excitation .",
    "the same suppression observed in xx - x crosscorrelation should lead to a narrowing of the bunching peak in cw experiments .",
    "therefore the contribution of single carrier capture can help to explain the unexpectedly wide antibunching dip in x - x autocorrelation under cw excitation reported for cdte / znte qds,@xcite while no broadening was observed for the xx - x cross - correlation peak .",
    "furthermore , our results indicate that lifetime determination of qd excitons based on an analysis of correlation measurements@xcite may lead to significant errors if single carrier capture is neglected .",
    "a simple model was introduced to describe our results quantitatively .",
    "it includes occupation probabilities of five qd states , presented as a vector @xmath36}$ ] where @xmath37 is the probability of finding _",
    "i_-th qd state occupied at time _",
    "t_. since the qd confining potential is shallow,@xcite we do not include neutral or charged excitonic levels above the biexcitonic one . due to the low intensity of the cx line in the pl spectrum we also neglected negative qd charge states .",

    "since the model deals only with level occupations , it can not describe any coherent effects such as , e.g. , polarization conversion.@xcite it also neglects the fine structure of the excitonic states ( e.g. , dark excitons ) . within the assumed approximations , the five occupation probabilities sum to unity .",
    "the dynamics of the occupation vector can be expressed by the equation : d*n*/d_t _ = _",

    "a(t ) _ is a transition rate matrix describing radiative decays and excitation processes :    @xmath44 % \\end{displaymath}\\ ] ]    the important role of trapping of single carriers has already been discussed above .",
    "we also include the possibility of excitation by trapping free excitons which ( as follows from our simulations ) is needed to achieve the observed quadratic excitation - power dependence of xx line intensity .",
    "the characteristic timescales of the electron , hole and exciton trapping ( which may be different from one another ) are larger than the laser pulse width because of relaxation processes within the barrier material . with the small outer barrier thickness of 50  nm",
    "we expect the trapping rates to rise almost instantaneously and to decay with characteristic times of the order of the barrier exciton lifetime ( sec .",
    "[ sec : sample ] ) .",
    "therefore we assumed as a starting point a common exponential time dependence of the three excitation rates , with a decay time of @xmath45  ps . as we know the three radiative lifetimes @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 from independent experiments , the only free parameters of the model remain constants @xmath38 , @xmath39 and @xmath40 understood as time - integrated respective capture rates , e.g. , @xmath46 , where the heaviside function @xmath47 equals to 0 for @xmath48 and to 1 for @xmath49 .",

    "<S> systematic measurements of auto- and cross - correlations of photons emitted from individual cdte / znte quantum dots under pulsed excitation were used to elucidate non - resonant excitation mechanisms in this self - assembled system . </S>",
    "<S> memory effects extending over a few excitation pulses have been detected in agreement with previous reports and quantitatively described by a rate equation model , fitting a complete set of correlation and pl intensity results . </S>",
    "<S> the important role of single carrier trapping in the quantum dot was established . </S>",
    "<S> an explanation was suggested for the unusually wide antibunching dip observed previously in x - x autocorrelation experiments on quantum dots under cw excitation . </S>"
