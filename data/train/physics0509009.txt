    "a common table - top demonstration of the effects of surface tension is to float a metal needle horizontally on water : even though the density of the needle is much greater than that of water , the needle is able to remain afloat because of the relatively large vertical component of surface tension .",
    "this effect is a matter of life or death for water - walking insects @xcite , and is also important in practical settings such as the self - assembly of small metallic components into macroscopic structures via capillary flotation forces @xcite . in this engineering",
    "setting an object should not only float when isolated at the interface , but must also remain afloat after it has come into contact with other interfacial objects , and portions of the meniscus that supported it have been eliminated .",
    "although the interactions that cause interfacial objects to come into contact and form clusters have been studied extensively ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the implications of such interactions on the objects ability to remain afloat have not been considered previously .    here",
    "we consider the effects of these interactions via a series of model calculations that shed light on the physical and mathematical concepts that are at work in such situations .",
    "for simplicity , the calculations presented here are purely two - dimensional , though the same physical ideas apply to three - dimensional problems .",
    "perhaps the most natural way to characterise the effects of interaction is to ask how the maximum vertical load that can be supported by two floating cylinders varies as the distance between them is altered .",
    "we thus consider two cylinders of infinite length lying horizontally at the interface between two fluids of densities @xmath0 , as shown in figure [ 2cylchan ] .",
    "we assume that these cylinders are non - wetting so that the contact angle @xmath1 , a property of the three phases that meet at the contact line , satisfies @xmath2 .",
    "we non - dimensionalise forces per unit length by the surface tension coefficient , @xmath3 , and lengths by the _ capillary length _ , @xmath4 , and use non - dimensional variables henceforth .",
    "we wish to determine the maximum weight per unit length , @xmath5 , that can be supported by each of two identical cylinders with radius @xmath6 and centre  centre separation @xmath7 .",
    "to remain afloat each individual cylinder must satisfy a condition of vertical force balance : their weight ( or other load ) must be balanced by the vertical contributions of surface tension and the hydrostatic pressure acting on the wetted surface of the cylinder .",
    "we assume that an external horizontal force is applied to maintain the separation of the cylinders and so do not consider the balance of horizontal forces explicitly .",
    ".,height=132 ]    using the notation of figure [ 2cylchan ] , the vertical force balance condition may be written @xmath8 where @xmath9 are the contributions to the vertical upthrust provided by the deformation on each half of the cylinder separately , and @xmath10 is the height of the cylinders centres _ above _ the undeformed free surface .",
    "physically , the first term on the right hand side of is the vertical component of surface tension , and the second and third terms quantify the resultant of hydrostatic pressure acting on the wetted perimeter of the cylinder .",
    "the latter is given by the weight of water that would fill the dashed area in figure [ 2cylchan ] ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the angles @xmath11 and @xmath12 are determined by the interfacial shape , which is governed by the balance between hydrostatic pressure and the pressure jump across the interface associated with interfacial tension .",
    "this balance is expressed mathematically by the laplace  young equation . in two dimensions",
    "this is @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the deflection of the interface ( again measured positive upwards ) from the horizontal , and subscripts denote differentiation .",
    "since the exterior meniscus extends to infinity , the first integral of is particularly simple in this instance and allows the height of the contact line , @xmath15 , to be related to the interfacial inclination , @xmath16 , via @xmath17 this , together with the geometrical condition @xmath18 , allows @xmath11 to be eliminated from in favour of @xmath19 and @xmath1 .    for the interior meniscus",
    ", we simultaneously obtain @xmath12 and the shape @xmath14 , by using the matlab routine ` bvp4c ` to solve the nonlinear eigenproblem @xmath20 on @xmath21 $ ] .    with the angles @xmath11 and",
    "@xmath12 calculated , @xmath22 can be determined from , and the maximum load that can be supported , @xmath23 , can be found numerically by varying @xmath10 . of particular interest is the dependence of @xmath23 on the cylinder separation , which is shown for several values of the _ bond number _ @xmath24 in figure [ modgraph ] .",
    "this plot includes the limiting case @xmath25 , corresponding to the application of two point forces to the interface .",
    "away when @xmath26 for several values of the bond number , @xmath24 .",
    "the dashed line shows the linear approximation for the limiting case @xmath25 when @xmath27.,height=151 ]    the results presented in figure [ modgraph ] show that as the distance between two cylinders decreases , the maximum vertical load that can be supported by each cylinder decreases .",
    "physically , this result is intuitive since even though the interior meniscus is not completely eliminated in this instance , the vertical force that this meniscus can exert on the cylinder is diminished by the symmetry requirement that @xmath28 . in particular , for small @xmath29 and @xmath30 the total force that can be supported by each cylinder is around half of that which can be supported by an isolated cylinder .",
    "this corresponds to the simple physical picture that for small bond number , the restoring force is supplied primarily by the deformation of the meniscus @xcite ; when the interior meniscus is eliminated , the contact line length per cylinder , and hence the force that surface tension can provide , are halved . from this",
    "we expect that very dense objects that float when isolated at an interface might sink as they approach one another . since floating objects move towards one another due to capillary flotation forces ( see",
    "* for example ) , it seems likely that this effect may be ubiquitous for dense objects floating at an interface and may also have practical implications .    for @xmath25 we can compute the asymptotic form of @xmath23 for @xmath27 by noting that for small separations the interior meniscus has small gradients and the laplace  young equation may be approximated by @xmath31 , which has the solution @xmath32 .",
    "thus , the vertical force provided by the deformation is @xmath33 , which is extremised when @xmath34 .",
    "choosing the real root of this quartic corresponding to a maximum in @xmath5 and making consistent use of @xmath27 , @xmath23 can be expanded as a series in @xmath30 .",
    "we obtain @xmath35which compares favourably with the numerically computed results presented in figure [ modgraph ] .",
    "whilst the scenario considered in the previous section may be relevant in practical situations , it does not lend itself to particularly simple experimental validation . to allow for such a comparison",
    ", we now consider the equilibrium of two infinitely long , shallow strips of dimensional thickness @xmath36 , width @xmath37 , and density @xmath38 , floating with their long edges in contact so that the interior meniscus is completely eliminated .",
    "the configuration is shown schematically in figure [ 2psetup ] . here",
    ", we are no longer bound by a contact angle condition but instead assume that the meniscus is pinned to the uppermost corners of the strips .",
    "the additional complication of the strip s angle of inclination to the horizontal , @xmath39 , is determined by the balance of torques .",
    "( this condition is satisfied automatically for shapes with circular cross - section and constant contact angle , as shown by @xcite . )",
    "equating moments about the point of contact ( thereby eliminating the need to calculate the tension force that the strips exert on one another ) and balancing vertical forces , we obtain the conditions for equilibrium @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the appropriate ratio of the density of the strips to those of the surrounding fluids . after eliminating @xmath42 between and and using with the relation @xmath43 to eliminate @xmath16",
    ", we have a single equation for @xmath39 given particular values of @xmath44 and @xmath10 .",
    "thus , for fixed @xmath44 and a given value of @xmath10 , we may solve for @xmath39 and deduce the corresponding value of @xmath42 from . by varying @xmath10",
    "we are then able to calculate the maximum value of @xmath42 for which equilibrium is possible , much as before .",
    "the numerical results of this calculation are presented in figure [ 2ptouch ] .     as the half - width of the strips , @xmath44 , is varied ( solid line ) .",
    "experimental results ( as described in text ) are shown by points @xmath45 ( strips that sink ) and @xmath46 ( strips that float).,height=188 ]    also shown in figure [ 2ptouch ] are experimental results showing points in @xmath47 parameter space for which two identical strips remained afloat or sank upon touching .",
    "these experiments were performed with strips of stainless - steel shim of length @xmath48 with @xmath49 and thickness @xmath50 or @xmath51 .",
    "these were floated on aqueous solutions of @xmath52 , @xmath53 or @xmath54 methanol in air ( so that @xmath55 ) , allowing a wide range of values of @xmath44 and @xmath42 to be probed .",
    "the strips were then allowed to come into contact naturally via the mutually attractive flotation force @xcite .",
    "the data are plotted with horizontal and vertical error bars .",
    "the former indicate the uncertainty in the measurement of the strip widths .",
    "the latter indicate the uncertainty in the additional vertical force contribution of the ends ( since the strips are of finite length ) , which may be shown to be equivalent to an uncertainty in the effective value of @xmath42 .",
    "the agreement between our experiments and theory in this instance is very good .",
    "by adding additional strips to a floating pair of strips , a flexible raft is formed .",
    "given the analysis of the preceding sections it is natural to expect that as the raft is lengthened in this manner , there will come a point where its weight ( which scales with its total length ) exceeds the force that can be supplied by surface tension ( which is constant ) and so the raft should sink .",
    "the situation is complicated by the fact that the raft may bow in its middle , displacing a considerable amount of liquid in this region , as pointed out by @xcite .",
    "we now address the question of whether , for a raft of given weight per unit length , there is a maximum raft length before sinking occurs .",
    "we tackle this problem by treating the raft as a continuum , shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ raftsetup ] , and formulating an equation for the deformation of such a raft .",
    "this generalises the linear analysis of @xcite and allows us to consider situations in which interfacial deformations are no longer small , including the existence of a threshold length for sinking .",
    "we use a variational approach to determine the shape @xmath56 of the raft and the surrounding meniscus , though the same result may also be obtained by considering the force balance on an infinitesimal raft element .",
    "the non - dimensional arc - length , @xmath57 , is measured from the raft s axis of symmetry at @xmath58 , with the two ends of the raft being at @xmath59 . for simplicity",
    ", we neglect the intrinsic bending stiffness of the raft , although @xcite have shown that interfacial rafts do , in general , have some resistance to bending . the variational principle states that raft shapes must minimise the energy of the system over variations in @xmath60 and @xmath61 , subject to the constraint that @xmath62 . introducing a lagrange multiplier @xmath63 associated with this constraint",
    ", we find that equilibrium raft shapes extremise @xmath64\\right)\\mathrm{d}s,\\ ] ] where @xmath42 was defined in and @xmath65 is the indicator function of the raft .",
    "the first two terms in the integral correspond to the gravitational energy of the displaced fluid and the raft , the third term is the surface energy of the uncovered liquid area , and the final term ensures that the constraint @xmath62 is satisfied . note that a small increase in arc - length such that @xmath66 increases the energy of the system so that the lagrange multiplier @xmath63 may be interpreted physically as the tension in the raft / meniscus . that the raft can support",
    "a tension at all may seem counterintuitive .",
    "it is a consequence of the attractive capillary interaction that would exist between two infinitesimally separated raft elements .    requiring @xmath67 to be stationary with respect to variations in @xmath60 and @xmath61 yields differential equations for @xmath68 and @xmath69 . using the differential form of the constraint , @xmath70",
    ", we may eliminate @xmath71 to obtain @xmath72 .",
    "this may be integrated using the boundary term from integration by parts at @xmath73 , the boundary conditions @xmath74 and @xmath75 as well as the continuity of @xmath71 at the raft edge , @xmath59 , to give @xmath76 , where @xmath77 .",
    "we now find the raft shape numerically by solving the nonlinear eigenproblem @xmath78 for @xmath61 , @xmath60 , @xmath79 on @xmath80 $ ] , and @xmath15 , using the matlab routine ` bvp4c ` .",

    "this allows us to consider the behaviour of @xmath90 for a given value of @xmath42 as @xmath10 is varied .",
    "the tension at the midpoint of the raft is given by @xmath91 , showing that the raft goes into compression if @xmath92 .",
    "physically this is unrealistic , corresponding to a divergence in @xmath93 .",
    "if @xmath94 , this situation is avoided automatically since @xmath95 but for @xmath96 we must consider this possibility ; we therefore consider these two cases separately .",
    "when @xmath94 , the centre of the raft may reach its neutral buoyancy depth @xmath97 without going into compression .",
    "numerical computation of the integral suggests that rafts grow arbitrarily long as @xmath98 ( see figure [ dres]@xmath99 ) . to show that this is the case , we consider the asymptotic behaviour of the integral in the limit @xmath100 , since @xmath101 . ] .",
    "this is done by splitting the range of integration into two sub - regions @xmath102 $ ] and @xmath103 $ ] , where @xmath104 is unspecified save for the condition that @xmath105 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . within these two regions ,",

    "cancel , yielding @xmath107 where @xmath108 .",
    "this result compares favourably with the numerical results in figure [ dres](a ) .",
    "in particular , notice that @xmath90 diverges logarithmically as @xmath109 ( i.e.  as @xmath110 ) so that rafts of arbitrary length are possible .",
    "it also interesting to note that may be inverted to give an estimate of @xmath111 for given values of @xmath42 and @xmath90  a useful result when calculating raft shapes for large @xmath90 .    that a raft of sufficiently low density can grow arbitrarily large in horizontal extent without sinking seems surprising at first glance .",
    "however , as new material is added to the raft , it may be accommodated at its neutral buoyancy level without the raft going into compression .",

    "we thus expect that a maximum raft length does exist and , further , that the limiting raft has @xmath120",
    ". numerical computation of @xmath90 as a function of @xmath10 indicates that a critical half - length @xmath116 does exist , but that it is not attained with exactly this value of @xmath10 . instead",
    ", there is a competition between the raft sinking deep into the liquid ( to support its weight by increased hydrostatic pressure ) and having its ends a large distance apart ( i.e. lower pressure but over larger horizontal distances ) , and some compromise is reached .",

    "this is precisely as we should expect physically since large density objects can only float when the contribution of surface tension dominates that of the buoyancy due to excluded volume and , in particular , it must balance the weight of the raft .",
    "this asymptotic result compares favourably with the the numerical results presented in figure [ dres](@xmath115 ) .",
    "a direct comparison between the theoretical results outlined so far and experimental results is difficult since we have modelled the raft as a perfectly flexible continuum body of infinite extent along its axis of symmetry . despite these limitations , the theoretical raft shapes calculated via this model are in good agreement with simple experiments in which thin strips of stainless steel shim are laid side - by - side at an air  water interface , as shown in figure [ raft ]  even when the raft consists of only a small number of strips and we might not expect the continuum approximation to be valid .     and @xmath90 : ( @xmath99 ) a complete raft with @xmath153 , @xmath154 ( @xmath115 ) one half of a raft with @xmath155 , @xmath156 and ( @xmath124 ) one half of a raft with @xmath155 , @xmath157 .",
    "the typical width of each individual strip is @xmath158 mm .",
    "the black region apparently above the raft is in fact a reflection of the black base of the confining tank from the meniscus at the edge of the tank , height=151 ]    although this agreement is encouraging , our main interest lies more in whether there is a maximum length for such a raft to remain afloat , as predicted by the model .",
    "practical considerations mean it is difficult to produce strips of stainless steel shim narrower than about @xmath158  mm in the workshop , so the comparisons we are able to draw between our model and experiments can only be semi - quantitative . in spite of these limitations , we find that for stainless steel strips of length @xmath159 mm and thickness @xmath160 mm the maximum raft - length is @xmath161 mm for an aqueous solution of 25% methanol ( so that @xmath162 ) and @xmath163 mm for 15% methanol ( so that @xmath164 ) , which are certainly consistent with the corresponding theoretical results of @xmath165 mm @xmath166 mm and @xmath167 mm @xmath168 mm , respectively . here",
    "the length was increased by floating additional strips near the raft and allowing them to come into contact via the mutually attractive capillary flotation forces until the raft was no longer stable and sank . with @xmath153 and @xmath155",
    ", we were able to add many strips without any sign of the raft sinking indicating that this process might be continued indefinitely .",
    "in this article , we have quantified the conditions under which objects can remain trapped at a fluid - fluid interface , and shown that when the deformation of the meniscus is suppressed by the presence of other objects the supporting force that can be generated decreases dramatically . for two small , parallel cylinders or strips , the maximum force that can be supported close to contact is only that provided by the contribution from the exterior meniscus and so sufficiently dense objects sink upon contact . a two - dimensional raft of touching",
    ", floating strips may compensate partially for this loss of meniscus by sinking lower into the fluid . for @xmath94 ,",
    "this effect allows rafts of arbitrary length to remain afloat . for @xmath96",
    ", there is a maximum length ( dependent on @xmath42 ) above which equilibrium is not possible .",
    "although the agreement between the experiments and theory presented here is good , our analysis was confined to two dimensions , whereas experiments must be carried out in the three - dimensional world .",
    "similarly , we have limited ourselves to considering the _ equilibrium _ of objects at an interface .",
    "we are currently studying the dynamics of sinking for the case of two touching strips considered in section [ 2strip ] , and find that a simple hydrodynamic model produces good agreement with experiments .",
