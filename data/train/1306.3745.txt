    "galactic transient black hole candidates ( bhcs ) are very interesting objects to study in x - rays because they exhibit rapid evolutions in their temporal and spectral properties during outbursts ( see for reviews , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the past two decades , especially after the launch of _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) , our understanding of black hole binaries has improved significantly .",
    "however , real progress in extracting physical parameters was hampered due to lack of appropriate data analysis software .",
    "for instance , fitting a spectrum with a black body and a power - law component ( so - called diskbb plus power - law , or compst models in xspec ) tells us that there is a multicolor soft photon source such as a shakura - sunyaev standard disk ( * ? ? ? * hereafter ss73 ) and a so - called compton cloud @xcite which is a hot region of free electrons with certain optical depth and temperature .",
    "however , cause of formation of the standard disk , nature and origin of compton cloud or a specific spectral state remained missing .",
    "there was no information about why and how optical depths and temperatures of the cloud or the accretion rates of the disk vary .",
    "a turning point in theoretical solutions of viscous transonic accretion flows around black holes @xcite came when it was shown that flows above a critical viscosity parameter @xmath1 will become a keplerian disk , while those below will remain sub - keplerian .",
    "this fact was used to construct a two component advective flow ( tcaf ) model ( @xcite , hereafter ct95 ; @xcite , hereafter c97 ) , which not only explains under what circumstances a standard keplerian disk could form , but also explains state transitions and variation of flow parameters during outbursts of several black holes reasonably well @xcite . in a tcaf solution , low viscosity and low angular momentum matter piles up behind a centrifugal barrier forming an axisymmetric shock ( c90a , b ; molteni et al . , 1994 ; ryu et al .",
    "1997 ) , which is by and large stable even under non - axisymmetric perturbations @xcite .",
    "this barrier is known as the ` centrifugal pressure dominated boundary layer ' , or cenbol and acts as the compton cloud .",
    "regions of higher viscosity forms a keplerian disk which settles down to a standard shakura - sunyaev disk when the cooling is efficient ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "soft photons from ss73 disk are inverse comptonized by the post - shock region ( cenbol ) to form hard photons and thus in the tcaf ( ct95 ) solution a separate compton cloud is not required .",
    "another novel aspect is that fitting with tcaf does not require explicit knowledge of viscosity parameter .",
    "tcaf directly uses two accretion rates , one for high viscosity flow ( for super - critical viscosity parameter @xmath1 ) , namely , standard ss73 like keplerian component ( disk ) , and the other for low viscosity flow ( sub - critical @xmath1 ) , namely , sub - keplerian ( low angular momentum ) component ( halo ) .",
    "location and strength of shocks which tcaf uses also depend on viscosity , but since we use them as fitting parameters , a prior knowledge of viscosity is not essential .",
    "furthermore , low - frequency quasi - periodic frequencies ( qpos ) are supposed to be due to oscillations of the cenbol region from where jets are originated @xcite .",
    "so a separate oscillating component is not required to explain qpos .",
    "non - thermal electrons are produced by the shock which may produce long power - law tail @xcite obviating the need to inject non - thermal electrons externally @xcite .",
    "thus , tcaf aims to resolve all the spectral and temporal properties along with disk - jet connections within the framework of a single solution .",
    "these advantages motivated us to fit spectral data from bhcs with tcaf @xcite , even when they may be fitted equally well with other available models ( such as diskbb plus power - law ) in xspec . other models do not discuss origin of the compton cloud or corona @xcite and do not unify timing properties ( e.g. , qpos ) with spectral properties or obtain outflow rates with spectral properties as tcaf does . unlike a persistent source , where accretion rates could be stable for a long time , in an outburst source , rates have to be varying .",
    "one of the most natural ways to achieve this is by varying viscosity .",
    "it is possible that an outburst may be triggered by enhancement of viscosity at the outer disk .",
    "@xcite suggested that enhanced viscosity redistributes part of halo ( i.e. , low angular momentum flow ) into a ss73 like keplerian flow , keeping the total mass - flow rate roughly constant .",
    "their conclusion was that the accretion rate of the disk must go up rapidly due to enhanced viscosity before coming down when viscosity is reduced again .",
    "this conversion and formation of tcaf configuration has been demonstrated recently by numerical simulations @xcite .",
    "a sudden increase in viscosity at the outer edge would progressively shift inner edge of the keplerian disk towards the black hole which causes a enhancement of soft luminosity .",
    "declining phase starts when the source of enhanced viscosity is removed and there is a resulting shortfall of keplerian component .",
    "thus fitting an outburst source data with tcaf having two evolving accretion rates , shock location ( cenbol boundary ) and shock strength may give us insight into how the disk structure really evolves .",
    "as mentioned earlier , though enhanced viscosity and its temporal and spatial variations are believed to be the prime cause of the outburst , no prior knowledge of viscosity is required since the fitting parameters carry those information . in future , we would pursue to derive even more fundamental parameters , such as , specific energy and angular momentum distribution inside the flow and then computation of viscosity would be possible .    galactic transient black hole candidate ( bhc ) gx 339 - 4",
    "was first observed in 1973 @xcite by @xmath2 kev mit x - ray detector onboard oso-7 satellite .",
    "this stellar - mass black - hole binary has a mass function of @xmath3 = @xmath4 and low - mass companion of mass @xmath5 = @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "this binary system is located at a distance of @xmath7  kpc @xcite with r.a.=@xmath8 and dec.=@xmath9 .",
    "this recurring transient source has undergone five x - ray outbursts @xcite during the rxte era ( in the period from 1996 to 2011 ) .",
    "based on evolution of their spectral and timing properties @xcite which are also found to be correlated with a characteristic temporal evolution , namely , hardness - intensity diagram ( hid ) @xcite , various spectral states are identified during the past outbursts of the same source . in general , there are mainly four basic states - _ hard , hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate _ , and _ soft _ states are observed during an outburst @xcite . in the literature , one can find extensive discussions on the properties of these spectral states @xcite .",
    "complex outburst profile of bhcs begins and ends in hard / low hard state , keeping soft and intermediate states in between .",
    "it has been pointed out @xcite that these four basic spectral states form a hysteresis loop during their outburst phases in the sequence of _ hard @xmath10 hard - intermediate @xmath10 soft - intermediate @xmath10 soft @xmath10 soft - intermediate @xmath10 hard - intermediate @xmath10 hard_. according to tcaf , hard states are formed when soft photons are unable to cool the compton cloud ( comprising collectively of cenbol , pre - shock halo and outflow ) while reverse is true for soft states .",
    "intermediate states are a proof that accretion rates are comparable and they occur when viscosity is either rising or declining ( see also , * ? ? ?",
    "gx  339 - 4 showed x - ray activity of @xmath11  mcrab ( in @xmath12  kev ) , observed on 2010 january 03 with the maxi / gsc onboard iss @xcite .",
    "the source remained active in x - rays for the next @xmath13 months and during this period , the source was monitored with rxte , starting from 2010 january 12 @xcite .",
    "temporal and spectral properties of the source was studied extensively during this outburst by several authors ( @xcite , hereafter paper i ; @xcite , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "several attempts were made to explore multi - wavelength properties of the source during this outburst @xcite .",
    "temporal as well as spectral variabilities and radio jets are observed during this outburst @xcite . in _",
    "paper i _ , a preliminary result of timing and spectral properties during initial rising phase was presented .",
    "subsequently , in _ paper ii _ , detailed timing and spectral study during the entire outburst was presented . in both these papers , spectral properties were studied with a combination of conventional thermal ( disk black body ) and non - thermal ( power - law ) model components . in order to understand detailed accretion flow dynamics",
    ", we need to fit with a more physical model , such as tcaf , which would enable us to extract actual physical parameters of the accretion flow .    in this _",
    "paper _ , for the first time , we show results of implementation of tcaf model in heasarc s spectral analysis package xspec .",
    "our goal is to find how the flow parameters vary from the beginning to the end of the outburst of gx  339 - 4 during its recent 2010 - 11 episode .",
    "since the number of available rxte / pca archival data points is too high , we choose a total of @xmath14 observations spread over @xmath15 days of the entire outburst , starting from 2010 january 12 to 2011 march 6 .",
    "we also compare our fitted spectral results with that of the conventional combined disk black body ( dbb ) and power - law ( pl ) model presented in paper ii . from our current study",
    ", we obtain variations of the flow parameters for the same states , namely , _",
    "hard , hard - intermediate , soft - intermediate _ , and _ soft _ as described in paper ii . here",
    ", we mainly concentrate on the rising and the declining phases of the outburst , where state transitions occur . from the tcaf model",
    "fitted @xmath0  kev pca spectra , we find that the variations of dbb and pl fluxes during the outburst as observed by @xcite are consistent with variations of keplerian ( disk ) rate and sub - keplerian ( halo ) rate respectively .",
    "we find some intriguing properties of the variation of _ accretion rate ratio _",
    "( arr , i.e. , ratio between sub - keplerian halo and keplerian disk rates ) and frequencies of quasi - periodic oscillations ( lfqpos ; if observed ) during the days of class transitions . these will be discussed below and require further investigations .",
    "the _ paper _ is organized in the following way : in the next section , we present a briefly describe the tcaf solution and how a spectrum is generated . in  3 , we discuss observational results and data analysis procedures using heasoft software . here",
    ", we also mention methods of generation of tcaf model _ fits _",
    "file used for spectral fittings . in  4 , we present spectral analysis results obtained from tcaf model fits of rxte pca data and compare results with that of the combined dbb and pl model fits .",
    "we note special behaviour of the extracted flow properties when the object is in different spectral states , with a particular emphasis during state transitions .",
    "finally , in  5 , we present a brief discussion of our results and make concluding remarks .",
    "a brief description of two component advective flow ( tcaf ) solution has been given in the introduction .",
    "we use chakrabarti - titarchuk ( 1995 ; ct95 ) model code as the basic program for generating v0.1 of tcaf model _ fits _ file to fit black hole spectra . in the tcaf solution",
    ", an ss73 like keplerian disk ( high viscosity component ) at the equatorial plane is immersed inside a low angular momentum sub - keplerian ( low viscosity ) halo .",
    "the flow is considered to be axisymmetric . though accretion rates would be a function of radial distance in a rapidly evolving system such as an outburst @xcite , each observational result",
    "is fitted with an effective accretion rate .",
    "the keplerian disk , truncated at the shock location , locally emits a flux of radiation same as that produced by an ss73 disk .",
    "geometry around the black hole is described by @xcite pseudo - newtonian potential @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the radial distance of the flow in units of schwarzschild radius ( @xmath18 , @xmath19 being the velocity of light and @xmath20 being the mass of the black hole ) . as a black hole accretion is necessarily transonic ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* hereafter c90a ) , for a large region of the parameter space , the flow must jump from supersonic to subsonic branch , forming a standing or oscillating shock ( c89 ; c90a , b ) before entering into a black hole through the inner sonic point .",
    "ct95 considers the region between the shock to inner sonic point , namely , the post - shock region ( cenbol ) , to be the compton cloud .",
    "contribution of the pre - shock halo , or winds were separately discussed there . in the present fits",
    "file , we do not include effects of optically thin pre - shock halo and the outflowing matter .",
    "the cenbol cools down through inverse comptonization and produces observed hard photons .",
    "thus very cold cenbol does not produce hard photons or outflows at all .",

    "* and references therein ) . in ct95 spectral properties",
    "are studied using only strong shocks since the idea there was to show that tcaf could explain spectral state transitions , in principle .",
    "spectrum was generated for a set of keplerian ( disk ) rates , sub - keplerian ( halo ) rates and shock locations .",
    "unlike other models ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , tcaf does not require to add an extra ` reflection ' component , since this component is in built into the procedure .",
    "albedo at each disk radius is included in computing disk reflection .",
    "spectrum is calculated from intercepted photons by cenbol region .",
    "fraction of absorbed hard x - rays by the pre - shock keplerian disk is used to heat it up and emit blackbody radiation at a higher temperature .",
    "the procedure is iterated till a convergence in all parameters is achieved . as given in ct95 , we computed the effect by taking into account the photoelectric absorption and recoil effects .",
    "we took care of contribution of the first scattering exactly and of the multiple scattering using fokker - planck diffusion approximation @xcite . in an outburst",
    ", the shock is expected to have a time varying compression ratio @xmath21 , since the post - shock region is expected to cool down as accretion rate increases .",
    "this , in turn , is governed by enhancement of viscosity .",
    "thus , we use @xmath21 as a parameter .",
    "@xmath21 determines post - shock density ( radial optical depth ) and post - shock temperature , which , together with an assumption of vertical equilibrium gives height @xmath22 ( in @xmath23 ) of the flow at the shock @xmath24 ( in @xmath23 ) , an important quantity which determines percentage of soft photons intercepted by the compton cloud. flux @xmath25 emitted from the optically thick keplerian disk is obtained from ss73 , @xmath26 here , @xmath27 . in the above equation , mass of the black hole @xmath20 is measured in units of mass of the sun ( @xmath28 ) , disk accretion rate @xmath29 is in units of @xmath30 .",
    "although this equation was derived with a no - torque condition at the inner stable circular orbit ( isco ) at @xmath31 , it remains the same in our case , even though our ss73 disk is effectively evaporated inside the cenbol and mixes with the sub - keplerian flow when cenbol is hot enough ( in hard states ) .",
    "in soft states , the cenbol itself is cold and keplerian disk can reach close to isco .",
    "@xcite , calculated innermost disk radius for the black hole candidate gx  339 - 4 , which is consistent with the accepted picture of the high / soft state in which standard disk may always extend up to isco .",
    "however , @xcite examined inner disk radius using different models ( e.g. , thermal and relativistic line broadening etc . ) at different luminosities in the hard states and found that the disk need not go up to isco .",
    "in fact , since a black hole accretion is always supersonic , a keplerian disk will be almost sonic / transonic at isco to prepare itself for the final plunge into the horizon with a radial velocity same as that of the velocity of light .",
    "so , disk extending up to isco is always an assumption , more so for low accretion rates .",
    "this is also evident from viscose transonic flow solutions ( c90ab ) .",
    "angular momentum is transported inside the cenbol till the inner sonic point at @xmath32 ( see , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , where , ideally a torque - free condition should be applicable . inside @xmath33 , angular momentum transport is negligible . in future",
    ", we plan to actually simulate keplerian disk along with the halo and compute time dependent spectra and several assumptions made here would become unnecessary . already we have reported preliminary results of our simulations @xcite . in the simulation",
    ", temperature would be obtained from the global solution of an advective flow , and not as in ss73 where local gravitational energy dissipation was used .",
    "the post - shock region becomes hot due to conversion of kinetic energy of the pre - shock flow into thermal energy .",
    "however , electrons lose energy due to bremsstrahlung and comptonization of soft photons emitted from the keplerian disk .",
    "energy equation which protons and electrons obey in the post - shock region is given by ( ct95 ) , @xmath34 where , specific energy @xcite of the flow is given by , @xmath35 and @xmath36 and @xmath37 are the heating and the cooling terms , respectively . here , @xmath38 is the specific angular momentum in units of @xmath39 , @xmath40 is infall velocity in units of @xmath19 , @xmath41 is polytropic index , @xmath42 is the sound speed of the medium in units of @xmath19 , and @xmath43 is adiabatic index .",
    "equation ( 2 ) was not used in pre - shock halo region .",
    "synchrotron radiation was not used in the present version of our fits file .",
    "since temperature and height of the post - shock region depend on the shock location and strength , it is more physical to write them as functions of flow parameters . for this",
    ", we use pressure balance condition , where sum of the thermal pressure and the ram pressure must match on both sides of the shock @xcite . in pressure balance condition ( c89 ) , we assume that the pre - shock flow is cooler , @xmath44 as it falls freely and @xmath45 . using adiabatic @xmath46 , we get height of shock front as , @xmath47 for vertical equilibrium model",
    ". initial guess of the shock temperature is obtained from the definition @xmath48 .",

    "soft photons from the pre - shock keplerian disk are intercepted by the hot cenbol . as the accretion rate increases , number of scattering increases and photons gain more energy while cooling down the cenbol .",

    "however , cases with @xmath72 are not needed as spectral index is highly insensitive to @xmath73 near this limit @xcite .",
    "we also do not consider bulk motion comptonization ( see , ct95 ; * ? ? ?",
    "present model of tcaf does not include magnetic fields explicitly or production of non - thermal photons by the shock .",
