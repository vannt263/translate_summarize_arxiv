    "the diffusion of particles is a subject that has been studied extensively in many different contexts ( see @xcite and cites within ) . one of this contexts is the diffusion of particles inside narrow channels @xcite .",
    "however , the diffusion of interacting particles inside a confined environment has received much less attention , even when there are numerous examples in nature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we studied the transport of brownian particles in a channel of variable transverse width . on the one hand",
    ", we studied how the current of particles that cross an asymmetric cavity is modified by increasing the concentration , considering particles that interact through a hard - core potential . on the other hand , we introduced a modified fick ",
    "jacobs equation to describe this process .",
    "this equation has been solved using numerical methods for the case of asymmetric cavities .",
    "we mainly studied how the particles arrange inside the cavity , when a small force is applied .",
    "numerical simulations with the method of monte carlo where carried out .",
    "the results obtained with the equation are in complete agreement with the numerical simulations .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : triangle ] , we analyze the current of particles in a triangular cavity as a function of the concentration and we expose some of the characteristics of the numerical simulations . in sec .",
    "[ sec : equation ] , we explain the most important steps to derive the non  linear fick  jacobs equation . in sec .  [",

    " core interacting particles inside a triangular cavity . to perform the numerical simulations we depicted the triangular cavity inside a regular square lattice of @xmath1 sites , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : cavidadtriangular ] .",
    "the distance between neighboring sites is @xmath2 ( a value @xmath3 was considered ) .",
    "there is a small exit of size @xmath4 on each side .",
    "periodic boundary conditions were set in those exits to simulate a long chain of identical cavities .",
    "each site inside the cavity can be either occupied by a particle or empty .",
    "the hard  core interaction is realized by allowing only one particle on each site of the lattice .",
    "we define the mean concentration @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the total number of sites inside the cavity and @xmath7 is the number of particles . at the beginning of the simulation ,",
    "the particles are distributed randomly inside the cavity .",
    "the size of a particle is exactly one site , and they move by jumping to one nearest neighbor site . they are allowed to jump freely inside the cavity , except when the new site is occupied with another particle . in this case",
    "the particle remains on its site .",
    "we say that one monte carlo step occurs when , in average , every particle has had the opportunity to jump once .",
    "the particles are driven by a dimensionless external force , @xmath8 where . at any given time",
    ", a particle has four possible directions to move .",
    "one of the them has a a higher jump rate , due to the effect of the external force applied .",
    "the other three have the same ( lower ) jump rate .",
    "thus , if the force is applied to the right , the jump rates in different directions are @xmath9 where @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the diffusion coefficient . in the same way , if the force is applied to the left , and @xmath12 . in the first part of this paper we will analyze the difference in the current of particles of a system when the force is applied first to the right , and then to the left .",
    "we let the system evolve to the stationary state , and then we start to measure the relevant quantities , like the distribution of the particles inside the cavity , the distance covered by each one or the mean velocity , among others .    here",
    "we are interested in the total current of particles that cross the cavity , @xmath13 .",
    "if there were no interaction between particles , the current will be higher as the concentration or the force becomes higher .",
    "but that is not necessarily true for interacting particles . also ,",
    "because of the particular shape of the cavity , the current will not be the same when the external force is applied to the right , @xmath14 , or to the left , @xmath15 .",
    "since this asymmetric effect depends on the size of the particles , it has been proposed by reguera _ _ et al.__@xcite as a possible way to separate a mixture of different size particles .     a a function of the mean concentration @xmath16 in the cavity of fig .",
    "[ fig : cavidadtriangular ] .",
    "the values of the force are : @xmath17 .",
    "average over @xmath18 samples.,scaledwidth=70.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : deltaj ] we show the difference of currents of particles , @xmath19 as a function of the concentration for a wide range of forces .",
    "there are a few things that we can notice from this plot .",
    "around @xmath20 we can see there is a maximum value in the difference of the current @xmath21 .",
    "there is a value of the mean concentration , @xmath16 , for each value of the force , @xmath22 , for which the difference in the current is maximum .",
    "increasing the concentration after this point , will only decrease the asymmetric effect of the cavity . particularly , if the mean concentration is @xmath23 the asymmetric effect vanishes , and the current of particles is the same when the force is applied to the left or to the right , i.e. @xmath24 , independently of its magnitude .",
    "finally , if the concentration is higher than @xmath25 , we found that the current of particles when the force is applied to the left is always higher than the current of particles when the force is applied to the right .",
    "this is specially interesting because the asymmetry in the cavity is designed to favor the diffusion to the right .",
    "after this we can conclude that the hard ",
    "core interaction , whose influence increases as @xmath16 is increased , is the cause of an inversion of the asymmetry effect .",
    "the fick - jacobs equation describes the diffusion of non  interacting particles inside a channel of variable width .",
    "it has been used to describe the diffusion of not ",
    "interacting particles or in the low concentrations regime @xcite . in this work",
    "we have extended this equation to include the case of diffusion of particles with hard  core interaction . with this",
    "we mean that two particles can not occupy the same space .",
    "the excluded volume effect of the other particles has a considerable influence on the diffusion of a tagged particle .",
    "this equation allows us to describe a rather complex system , of many interacting particles inside a two or three  dimensional environment , with a simple uni - dimensional equation .    to derive the modified fick",
    "jacobs equation , let us consider a set of hard  core interacting particles in a one  dimensional discretized system , the so called single file diffusion @xcite . in a given configuration ,",
    "the current of particles between the sites @xmath26 and @xmath27 is given by , @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the occupation number of site @xmath26 , @xmath30 is the variation of the external potential and @xmath31 .",
