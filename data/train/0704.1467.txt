    "for this reason they have been extensively studied using theoretical models based on density - functional theory . in particular , capillary phase transitions exhibited by a nematic fluid confined between hard walls@xcite , or walls favoring a particular anchoring @xcite , have been predicted .",
    "when non - uniform liquid - crystal phases , such as the smectic phase , are included in the study of confined systems , the resulting surface phase diagrams display a rich phenomenology , which includes wetting transitions , the appearance of smectic defects @xcite , and layering transitions @xcite .    the effect of confinement on two - dimensional fluids is also an interesting topic of research .",
    "langmuir monolayers of lipids on the surface of water have been extensively studied in the last hundred years @xcite , and the discovery of structures and phase transitions in these systems has experienced a dramatic evolution driven by the new experimental techniques . now it is possible to confine these two - dimensional systems by external potentials and study the influence of the confinement on the molecular packing of surface monolayers .",
    "another paradigm of two - dimensional systems where the confinement plays an important role is the packing structures formed by particles in granular media @xcite .",
    "the crystallization of a quasi - two - dimensional one - component granular - disk fluid has recently been studied experimentally @xcite .",
    "it was found that the properties of the crystal structure obtained ( such as packing fraction , lattice structure , and lindenman parameter ) coincide with their counterparts obtained from mc simulations of a hard disk fluid .",
    "recent experiments have found non - equilibrium steady states in a vibrated granular rod monolayer with tetratic , nematic and smectic correlations @xcite .",
    "some of these textures are similar to the equilibrium thermodynamic states of two - dimensional anisotropic fluids resulting from density - functional calculations @xcite and mc simulations @xcite .",
    "it was shown by several authors that the inherent states of some frozen granular systems can be described by equilibrium statistical mechanics @xcite .",

    "we are interested in the calculation of the surface phase diagram of a hard rectangle ( hr ) fluid confined by a single or two hard lines .",
    "we can think on a hr fluid as an experimental realization of a system of hard cylinders confined between two plates at a distance less than twice the cylinder diameter .",
    "we suggest that some of the surface phase transitions obtained here by applying the density functional formalism to a confined two - dimensional hr fluid should be similar to the steady states of confined granular rods .",
    "some experiments are required to verify this hypothesis .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii we present the theoretical model : the fundamental - measure density functional applied to a hr fluid in the restricted - orientation approximation .",
    "this section is divided into two subsections . in the first the model is particularized to the study of the bulk phases , while in the second part the theoretical expressions used in the calculations of the thermodynamic and structural properties of the interfaces are presented .",
    "the results are presented in sec .",
    "first we study the bulk phase diagram of a hr fluid with aspect ratio equal to 3 , and then the resulting surface phase diagrams of a single wall - hr fluid interface and of the fluid confined between two hard lines are presented .",
    "some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "in this section we introduce the theoretical model used in the calculations of the bulk and interface equilibrium phases .",
    "to study highly inhomogeneous phases such as those resulting from the confinement of a fluid in a narrow slit geometry or the solid phase with a high packing fraction , we have used the fundamental - measure theory ( fmt ) applied to an anisotropic fluid of hard rectangles .",
    "it is well known that this formalism presents a great advantage over other techniques when dealing with highly inhomogeneous phases , and that this is mainly due to the fact that a basic requirement to construct the fmt density functional is that it conform with the dimensional cross - over criterium @xcite . to implement the calculations",
    "we have used the restricted - orientation approximation , where the axes of the rectangles are restricted to align only along the coordinate axes @xmath0 or @xmath1 .",

    "these density profiles have the symmetries corresponding to the equilibrium phases , which can be the isotropic or nematic fluids , the smectic phase ( with particles arranged in layers with their long axes pointing perpendicular to the layers ) , the columnar phase ( with long axes parallel to the layers ) , plastic solid ( particles located at the nodes of the square grid with averaged orientational order parameter over the cell equal to zero ) , and oriented solid ( with both translational and orientational order ) . to take proper account of all these possible symmetries ,",
    "we have used a fourier - series expansion of the density profiles : @xmath19 where we defined @xmath20 [ with @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 are the wave vector components parallel to @xmath0 and @xmath1 axes respectively , and @xmath24 , @xmath25 are the periods of the rectangular grid along these directions .",

    "we have selected the orientational director parallel to @xmath1 .",
    "thus , the equilibrium smectic ( columnar ) phase should be found by minimizing the free energy with respect to the fourier amplitudes @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) , the smectic ( columnar ) period @xmath25 ( @xmath24 ) and the order parameter @xmath41 $ ] [ related to the @xmath30 s through the relations @xmath42 where the symbols @xmath43 stand for particle alignment along @xmath1 and @xmath0 respectively ] . for uniform phases",

    "as we want to study the hard wall - fluid interface or the hr fluid confined in a slit geometry , we have introduced the following external potential : @xmath49 for the semi - infinite system , and @xmath50 for the slit geometry , where @xmath51 is the slit width , and the normal to the wall was selected in the @xmath0 direction .",
    "note that this external potential represents a hard line which excludes the center of mass of particles at distances less than their contact distances with the wall . in this sense",

    "a detailed study of the complete phase diagram , necessary to elucidate this point , is a work in progress .",
    "we now proceed to make a comparison between the results for the 2d zwanzig model with @xmath68 obtained above and those for hard parallelepipeds with restricted orientations and the same value of @xmath83 @xcite .",
    "this comparison will show the differences in phase behaviour between three and two dimensions as predicted by fundamental - measure theory ( which , as already pointed out , conforms with the dimensional crossover criterion ) . as shown in ref .",

    "it is well known that the presence of a hard wall in a system of elongated particles induces parallel alignment of the particle axes with respect to the wall @xcite .",
    "this preferential alignment is a result of the entropic depletion effect . in the parallel configuration ,",
    "the centers of mass of the particles are much closer to the wall , so the gain in volume per particle is larger and , as a consequence , the configurational entropy of the system is maximized .",
    "this effect is responsible for the occurrence of a biaxial nematic phase which breaks the orientational symmetry in a three - dimensional nematic fluid @xcite . the same depletion mechanism is at work in 2d , as we will show below .",
    "the results from the minimization are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( a ) and ( b ) for an undersaturation of @xmath88 .",
    "as we can see from the figure , the density and order - parameter profiles indicate columnar order near the wall , which propagates several columnar periods into the fluid phase .",
    "the wall - fluid interaction enhances the orientational order near the surface and the adsorption of particles , creating a structured layer with columnar - phase symmetry which grows in width with increasing chemical potential and diverges at @xmath89 .",

    "the above expression is plotted against @xmath101 in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ( b ) , where the results from direct calculation of @xmath102 , using the equilibrium density profiles obtained , are also plotted . as we can see",

    "thus , the i - c interfacial tension can be calculated as half the excess surface free energy resulting from the minimization .",
    "we have found a value of @xmath104 .",
    "finally , to verify that young s law for complete wetting holds , we need to calculate the surface tension of the wall - columnar interface . to construct density profiles compatible with this semi - infinite interface",
    ", one has to establish a boundary , at the side of the computational box opposite to the wall , and place , beyond the boundary and into the bulk , a periodically structured profile , choosing the phase ( i.e. the value of the profile at the boundary ) arbitrarily within the bulk period .",
    "although this recipe can in principle be implemented , we have chosen to fix bulk i - c coexistence conditions in a confined columnar phase and calculate the density profile of the system confined between two walls ; the separation between the walls was chosen large enough so that the effects of having a finite interface penetration length caused by the presence of the confined external potential can be neglected . also , in order to ensure that commensurability effects can be ignored , the distance between the walls was set to a ( large ) integer number of equilibrium periods of the columnar phase .",
    "the results from these calculations are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( a ) and ( b ) . the w - c surface tension calculated as half the value of the excess surface free energy results in @xmath105 , compatible with young s law in conditions of complete wetting of the w - i interface by the columnar phase .",

    "in particular , we are interested in the enhancement of the orientational and layering ordering due to confinement , and the commensurability effects exhibited by a layered phase sandwiched between two hard walls at a distance that may or may not commensurate with the period of the bulk columnar phase .",
    "it is well known that , under certain circumstances ( related to the nature of the fluid - fluid and surface - fluid interactions ) , a fluid inside a pore can exhibit capillary first - order phase transitions between two different phases at a chemical potential below the bulk coexistence value .",
    "an example of this phenomenon is the recently studied capillary nematization @xcite and smectization @xcite of a liquid crystal fluid inside a pore .",
    "the bulk condensed phase may have uniform ( nematic ) or nonuniform density profiles . for the latter case , capillary layering transitions between interfacial phases with different number of smectic layers @xcite can also be found . here",
    "we will show that these capillary and layering phase transitions are not unique to 3d system .",
    "they are also present in 2d anisotropic fluids which can stabilize layered phases with different spatial symmetries , such as the columnar phase .    with a view to finding the effects of confinement on columnar ordering in a hr fluid ,",
    "we have minimized the excess surface free energy with respect to the density profile for the particular case of hr s with @xmath68 .",
    "the fluid is confined by two hard walls at a distance @xmath106 ( in units of the particle width ) .",
    "as already pointed out , hard walls favor alignment parallel to the wall , as well as adsorption of particles at both surfaces ( density and order parameters at contact are much higher than their bulk values ) .",
    "this coupled translational - orientational ordering near the surfaces propagates into the fluid , creating columnar ordering .",
    "we have found that for low values of the chemical potential of the bath the density profile is structureless ( except just at the wall contact ) , similar to the bulk isotropic phase . increasing the chemical potential several damped columnar peaks appear near the wall in a continuous fashion , i.e. with their heights increasing continuously . at some value of the chemical potential ,",

    "we will take the convention to call the first ` isotropic ' , and the second ` columnar ' surface phases .",
    "this convention is justified by the fact that , just before the transition described above , columnar ordering increases continuously , starting from an isotropic - like density profile , as the chemical potential is increased .",
    "thus we can not trace out a definite boundary ( a value for @xmath85 below that corresponding to first order phase transition ) below or above which the profile inside the pore can be considered isotropic or columnar .",
    "only the first order phase transition described above can really distinguish two different surface phases , one of them less ordered ( following our convention , the isotropic phase ) than the other ( the columnar phase ) . as we can see in the figure , the latter has 25 columnar peaks .",

    "alternatively we can find the transition from @xmath108 to @xmath109 columnar layers by fixing the chemical potential and increasing the pore width @xmath51 .",

    "the parabola below the bulk transition line corresponds to first - order transition lines separating regions of stability of the isotropic and the columnar interfacial phases , while the straight lines indicate layering transitions .",

    "[ fig12 ] ) . at each side of the minimum",
    "the solvation force change the sign to positive ( left side ) or negative ( right side ) as we compress or expand the film , respectively , while the change in adsorption remains positive .",
    "the kelvin equation for capillary condensation in a slit geometry relates the undersaturation in chemical potential with pore width @xmath51 as @xmath124 where @xmath125 and @xmath126 are the bulk coexisting densities of phases @xmath127 and @xmath128 ( @xmath127 being the condensed phase ) , while @xmath129 is the surface tension of the corresponding interface .",
    "it was assumed that complete wetting by the @xmath127 phase occurs at the w-@xmath128 interface . for a detailed discussion of the kelvin equation in the context of liquid crystal phase transitions",
    "@xcite . applying this equation using @xmath130 ( the location of the minimum in the @xmath111 phase diagram of fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] ) , we obtain an undersaturation @xmath131 , while its real value is @xmath132 . in the derivation of the kelvin equation ,",
    "deviations from the bulk structure of the density profile arising from the confinement by the external potential are neglected . also , the elastic energy resulting from the compression or expansion of a layered phase confined between two walls is not taken into account",
    ". these effects might be responsible for the differences found between our calculations and the estimation based on the kelvin equation .",
    "we have checked that the sequence of minima in the @xmath111 phase diagram tends to @xmath87 as @xmath133 , a result predicted by eq .",
    "( [ kelvin ] ) .",
    "@xcite and @xcite showed that the capillary nematization line of the confined liquid - crystal fluid ends in a critical point for small values of the pore width . in order to study how the topology of the surface phase diagram changes in the regime of small pore widths , we have carried out the corresponding calculations of interfacial structure .",
    "we have found that the i - c capillary ordering transition changes at some particular value of @xmath51 ( near its maximum undersaturation represented by the minimum in the i - c interface coexisting curve ) from first to second order",
    ". for lower values of @xmath51 two critical points emerge from this single point , the distance between them increasing . in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] one of these scenarios is shown .",
    "as we can see , there is a range of values of @xmath51 ( near the triple points ) where the first - order capillary ordering transitions are still present but , between the critical points belonging to different layering branches , columnar ordering grows continously from the isotropic ( damped columnar interfacial phase ) to a highly - ordered columnar phase .",
    "layering transitions are always present even for very small @xmath51 , as will be shown below",
    ". an interesting feature of this phase diagram is that the location of the triple points moves above the bulk coexistence value @xmath87 .",
    "this indicates that the interfacial columnar phase just below the triple points can be unstable for values of chemical potentials corresponding to those of columnar - phase stability at bulk ( similar to the capillary evaporation of the confined fluid ) . for wide enough slits ( those for which the parabolas are connected )",
    "the triple points are practically located at @xmath87 , as can be observed from fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] .    for even smaller values of @xmath51 ,",
    "only layering transitions remain ; these end in critical points located above @xmath87 , as fig .",
    "[ fig14 ] shows .    when the width @xmath51 is such that the pore can only accommodate one particle with its long axis perpendicular to the wall ( or not more than four or three particles aligned parallel to the wall ) the system is near the one - dimensional limit .",
    "it is known that hard - core systems in this limit do not exhibit first - order phase transitions , but even for very narrow slits we can still find first - order transitions at which the density profile experiences an abrupt change inside the pore . in fig .",
    "[ fig15 ] ( a ) and ( b ) we show two coexisting density profiles corresponding to oversaturations , @xmath134 and @xmath135 , and pore widths @xmath136 and @xmath137 in ( a ) and ( b ) , respectively . the fluid inside the pore undergoes a phase transition , which dramatically changes the structure of the interfacial density profiles by increasing the heigh of four [ fig .",
    "[ fig15](a ) ] or three [ ( b ) ] density peaks inside the pore .",
    "in this article we have shown that 2d fluids composed of anisotropic particles interacting via hard - core repulsion and confined in a slit geometry exhibit a complex and rich interfacial phase behavior .",
    "apart from first - order capillary columnar ordering , we have also found layering transitions in this system .",
    "these results are similar to those found in 3d liquid - crystal fluids confined in a pore , where capillary smectization and layering phenomena were also found @xcite . in view of these similarities",
    ", we can extract the conclusion that , independent of the system dimensionality and the peculiarities of the layered phases , either smectic or columnar , if the fluid - wall interaction enhances layered interface ordering ( homeotropic in case of smectic phases , and the entropically favored parallel alignment for the columnar phase ) , compatible with the equilibrium bulk phase , then the confined fluid exhibits the interfacial phase transitions described above .",
    "in this study we have used as a model a hard - rectangle fluid , and the density and the order - parameter profiles were calculated by minimizing the excess surface free - energy functional resulting from the fundamental - measure theory applied to the two - dimensional zwanzig model .",
    "the orientational degrees of freedom were discretized , in order to take advantage of having a free - energy functional which reduces to the exact one - dimensional functional when the density profile is constrained to lie along a line .",
    "this property is crucial to study strongly confined fluids ( as is the case in this study ) , in particular when the pore width has only a few particle diameters in width .    as already pointed out in sec .",
    "[ intro ] , some experiments had shown profound similarities between particle configurations obtained as stationary states of systems of anisotropic grains and those corresponding to the equilibrium states obtained by density functional minimization @xcite . these similarities can be explained by applying a maximum - entropy principle on granular collections of particles , i.e. for a fixed packing fraction , externally - induced vibrational motion forces the system to explore those stationary states which maximize the configurational entropy ( since the grains can not overlap ) .",
    "of course , equilibrium statistical mechanics is unable to propose an equation of state for granular matter , but it could be possible to predict that granular matter composed of anisotropic particles and confined between parallel walls may support a stationary texture consisting of layers of particles oriented parallel to the wall .",
    "the manner in which the grain orientations propagate into the container would depend on the average packing fraction and on the frequency of the external force . only at this qualitative level",
    "can we give some insight into possible complete wetting phenomena and capillary ordering in granular rod fluids confined between two horizontal plates at a distance slightly larger than the particle dimensions in the vertical direction ( thus simulating a two - dimensional system ) , and also confined by one or two vertical planes ( these playing the role of hard walls ) .",
    "some calculations ( not shown here ) on the 2d hr fluid show that , for different aspect ratios , 2d smectic and crystal phases can be stable over some range of packing fractions",
    ". it would be interesting to explore whether confinement suppresses or enhances bulk ordering , and to study the changes in the surface phase diagram when phases of different symmetries are included .",
    "work along this direction is currently in progress .",
