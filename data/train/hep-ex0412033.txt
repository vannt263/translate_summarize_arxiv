    "over the past 83 years , the study of dipole moments of elementary particles has provided a wealth of information on subatomic physics . from the pioneering work of stern@xcite through the discovery of the large anomalous magnetic moments of the proton@xcite and neutron@xcite",
    ", the ground work was laid for the discovery of spin , of radiative corrections and the renormalizable theory of qed , of the quark structure of baryons and the development of qcd .",
    "a charged particle with spin @xmath2 has a magnetic moment @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath5 is the anomaly , and the latter expression is what one finds in the particle data tables.@xcite    the dirac equation tells us that for spin one - half point - like particles , @xmath6 for spin angular momentum , and is unity for orbital angular momentum ( the latter having been verified experimentally@xcite ) . for point particles ,",
    "the anomaly arises from radiative corrections , two examples of which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : aexpan ] .",
    "the lowest - order correction gives the famous schwinger@xcite result , @xmath7 , which was verified experimentally by foley and kusch.@xcite the situation for baryons is quite different , since their internal quark structure gives them large anomalies .",
    "in general @xmath5 ( or @xmath8 ) is an expansion in @xmath9 , @xmath10 with 1 diagram for the schwinger ( second - order ) contribution , 5 for the fourth order , 40 for the sixth order , 891 for the eighth order .",

    "the electron anomaly is now measured to a relative precision of about four parts in a billion ( ppb),@xcite which is better than the precision on the fine - structure constant @xmath16 , and kinoshita has used the measured electron anomaly to give the best determination of @xmath16.@xcite the electron anomaly will be further improved over the next few years.@xcite    the muon anomaly is measured to 0.5 parts per million ( ppm).@xcite the relative contributions of heavier particles to @xmath5 scales as @xmath17 , so the muon has an increased sensitivity to higher mass scale radiative corrections of about 40,000 over the electron . at a precision of @xmath18 ppm ,",
    "the muon anomaly is sensitive to @xmath19 gev scale physics .",
    "the standard model value of @xmath20 has measurable contributions from three types of radiative processes : qed loops containing leptons ( @xmath21 ) and photons;@xcite hadronic loops containing hadrons in vacuum polarization loops;@xcite and weak loops involving the @xmath22 and @xmath23 weak gauge bosons ( the standard model higgs contribution is negligible),@xcite @xmath24 a significant difference between the experimental value and the standard model prediction would signify the presence of new physics .",
    "a few examples of such potential contributions are lepton substructure , anomalous @xmath25 couplings , and supersymmetry.@xcite    the cern experiment@xcite observed the contribution of hadronic vacuum polarization shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : had](a ) at the 8 standard deviation level .",
    "unfortunately , the hadronic contribution can not be calculated directly from qcd , since the energy scale is very low ( @xmath26 ) , although blum@xcite has performed a proof of principle calculation on the lattice .",
    "fortunately dispersion theory gives a relationship between the vacuum polarization loop and the cross section for @xmath27 , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and experimental data are used as input .",
    "the factor @xmath30 in the dispersion relation , means that values of @xmath31 at low energies ( the @xmath32 resonance ) dominate the determination of @xmath33 . in principle",
    ", this information could be obtained from hadronic @xmath34 decays such as @xmath35 , which can be related to @xmath36 annihilation through the cvc hypothesis and isospin conservation.@xcite however , inconsistencies between information obtained from @xmath36 annihilation and hadronic tau decays , plus an independent confirmation of the cmd2 high - precision @xmath36 cross - section measurements by the kloe collaboration,@xcite have prompted davier , hcker , et al , to state that until these inconsistencies can be understood only the @xmath36 data should be used to determine @xmath33.@xcite         conversion , showing the relevant slepton mixing matrix elements .",
    "the mdm and edm give the real and imaginary parts of the matrix element , respectively . ]",
    "the hadronic light - by - light contribution ( see fig .",
    "[ fg : had](e ) ) has been the topic of much theoretical investigation.@xcite unlike the lowest - order contribution , it can only be calculated from a model , and this contribution is likely to provide the ultimate limit to the precision of the standard - model value of @xmath20 .",
    "one of the very useful roles the measurements of @xmath20 have played in the past is placing serious restrictions on physics beyond the standard model . with the development of supersymmetric theories as a favored scheme of physics beyond",
    "the standard model , interest in the experimental and theoretical value of @xmath20 has grown substantially .",
    "susy contributions to @xmath20 could be at a measurable level in a broad range of models .",
    "furthermore , there is a complementarity between the susy contributions to the mdm , edm and transition moment for the lepton - flavor violating ( lfv ) process @xmath37 in the field of a nucleus .",
    "the mdm and edm are related to the real and imaginary parts of the diagonal element of the slepton mixing matrix , and the transition moment is related to the off diagonal one , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : susy ] .",
    "this reaction , along with the companion lfv decay @xmath38 , will be searched for in `` next generation '' experiments now under construction.@xcite    from neutrino oscillations we already know that lepton flavor is violated , and this violation will be enhanced if there is new dynamics at the tev scale .",
    "this same new physics could also generate measurable effects in the magnetic and electric dipole moments of the muon as well.@xcite",
    "the method used in the third cern experiment and the bnl experiment are very similar , save the use of direct muon injection@xcite into the storage ring,@xcite which was developed by the e821 collaboration .",
    "these experiments are based on the fact that for @xmath39 the spin precesses faster than the momentum vector when a muon travels transversely to a magnetic field .",
    "the spin precession frequency @xmath40 consists of the larmor and thomas spin - precession terms .",
    "the spin frequency @xmath40 , the momentum precession ( cyclotron ) frequency @xmath41 , are given by @xmath42 the difference frequency @xmath43 is the frequency with which the spin precesses relative to the momentum , and is proportional to the anomaly , rather than to @xmath8 .",
    "a precision measurement of @xmath20 requires precision measurements of the muon spin precession frequency @xmath44 , and the magnetic field , which is expressed as the free - proton precession frequency @xmath45 in the storage ring magnetic field .",
    "the muon frequency can be measured as accurately as the counting statistics and detector apparatus permit . the design goal for",
    "the nmr magnetometer and calibration system was a field accuracy of 0.1 ppm .",
    "the @xmath46 which enters in eq .",
    "[ eq : omeganoe ] is the average field seen by the ensemble of muons in the storage ring . in e821 we reached a precision of 0.17 ppm in the magnetic field measurement .",
    "an electric quadrupole@xcite is used for vertical focusing , taking advantage of the `` magic ''  @xmath47 at which an electric field does not contribute to the spin motion relative to the momentum . with both an electric and a magnetic field",
    ", the spin difference frequency is given by @xmath48 , \\label{eq : tbmt}\\ ] ] which reduces to eq .",
    "[ eq : omeganoe ] in the absence of an electric field . for muons with @xmath49 in an electric field alone , the spin would follow the momentum vector .",
    "the experimental signal is the @xmath50 from @xmath51 decay , which were detected by lead - scintillating fiber calorimeters.@xcite the time and energy of each event was stored for analysis offline .",
    "muon decay is a three - body decay , so the 3.1 gev muons produce a continuum of positrons ( electrons ) from the end - point energy down .",
    "since the highest energy @xmath50 are correlated with the muon spin , if one counts high - energy @xmath50 as a function of time , one gets an exponential from muon decay modulated by the @xmath52 precession .",
    "the expected form for the positron time spectrum is @xmath53 $ ] , however in analyzing the data it is necessary to take a number of small effects into account in order to obtain a satisfactory @xmath54 for the fit.@xcite the data from our 2000 running period is shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : wig00 ]    the experimental results from e821 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fg : amu ] , with the average @xmath55 which determines the `` world average '' .",
    "the theory value@xcite @xmath56 is taken from hcker et al.,@xcite , which updates their earlier analysis@xcite with the kloe data;@xcite and from hagiwara , et al.,@xcite who use a different weighting scheme for the experimental data when evaluating the dispersion integral but do not include the kloe data .",
    "when this theory value is compared to the standard model value using either of these two analyses@xcite for the lowest - order hadronic contribution , one finds @xmath57 or a discrepancy of 2.7 standard deviations .    .",
    "the strong interaction contribution is taken from references @xcite and @xcite . ]    to show the sensitivity of our measurement of @xmath20 to the presence of virtual electroweak gauge bosons , we subtract off the electroweak contribution of @xmath58 from the standard model value , compare with experiment and obtain @xmath59 a 4.7 standard deviation discrepancy .",
    "this difference shows conclusively that e821 was sensitive to physics at the 100 gev scale . at present , it is inconclusive whether we see evidence for contributions from physics beyond the standard - model gauge bosons .    with each data set ,",
    "the systematic error was reduced , and for the final data set taken in 2001 the systematic error on @xmath60 was 0.27 ppm with a statistical error of 0.66 ppm . given the tantalizing discrepancy between our result and the latest standard - model value , and the fact that the hadronic error could be reduced by about a factor of two over the next few years,@xcite we submitted a new proposal to brookhaven to further improve the experimental measurement .",
    "the goal of this new experiment is @xmath61 ppm total error , with the goal of controlling the total systematic errors on the magnetic field and on the muon frequency measurement to 0.1 ppm each .",
    "our proposal@xcite was given enthusiastic scientific approval in september 2004 by the laboratory , and has been given the new number , e969 .",
    "negotiations are underway between the laboratory and the funding agencies to secure funding .    a letter of intent ( loi ) for an even more precise 2 experiment was also submitted to j - parc.@xcite in that loi we proposed to reach a precision below 0.1 ppm . since it is not clear how well the hadronic contribution can be calculated , and whether the new brookhaven experiment e969 will go ahead",
    ", we will evaluate whether to press forward with this experiment at a later time .",
    "our loi at j - parc@xcite was predicated on pushing as far as possible at brookhaven before moving to japan .",
    "while the mdm has a substantial standard model value , the predicted edms for the leptons are unmeasurably small and lie orders of magnitude below the present experimental limits given in table [ tb : edm ] .",
    "an edm at a measurable level would signify physics beyond the standard model .",
    "susy models , and other dynamics at the tev scale do predict edms at measurable levels.@xcite    a new experiment to search for a permanent edm of the muon with a design sensitivity of @xmath62 @xmath63-cm is being planned for j - parc.@xcite this sensitivity lies well within values predicted by some susy models.@xcite feng , et al.,@xcite have calculated the range of @xmath64 available to such an experiment , assuming a new physics contribution to @xmath20 of @xmath65 , @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a _",
    "cp _ violating phase .",
    "this range is shown in fig .",

    "available to a dedicated muon edm experiment.@xcite the two bands show the one and two standard - deviation ranges if @xmath20 differs from the standard model value by @xmath68 . ]    of course one wishes to measure as many edms as possible to understand the nature of the interaction .",
    "while naively the muon and electron edms scale linearly with mass , in some theories the muon edm is greatly enhanced relative to linear scaling relative to the electron edm when the heavy neutrinos of the theory are non - degenerate.@xcite     and @xmath69 . ]    with an edm present , the spin precession relative to the momentum is given by @xmath70   \\nonumber \\\\ & \\qquad \\ \\   + & { e \\over m}\\left [ { \\eta \\over 2 } \\left ( { \\vec e \\over c } + \\vec \\beta \\times \\vec b \\right ) \\right ]   \\label{eq : omegawedm}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath71 and @xmath72 . for reasonable values of @xmath73 , the motional electric field",
    "@xmath74 is much larger than electric fields that can be obtained in the laboratory , and the two vector frequencies are orthogonal to each other .",
    "the edm has two effects on the precession : the magnitude of the observed frequency is increased , and the precession plane is tipped relative to the magnetic field , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fg : omegaeta ] .",
    "e821 was operated at the magic @xmath75 so that the focusing electric field did not cause a spin precession . in e821",
    "the tipping of the precession plane is very small , ( @xmath76 mrad ) if one uses the cern limit@xcite given in table [ tb : edm ] .",
    "this small tipping angle makes it very difficult to observe an edm effect in e821 , since the 2 precession ( @xmath44 ) is such a large effect .",
    "we have recently introduced a new idea which optimizes the edm signal , and which uses the motional electric field in the rest frame of the muon interacting with the edm to cause spin motion.@xcite the dedicated experiment will be operated off of the magic @xmath75 , for example at @xmath77 mev / c , and will use a radial electric field to stop the @xmath52 precession.@xcite then the spin will follow the momentum as the muons go around the ring , except for any movement arising from an edm . thus the edm would cause a steady build - up of the spin out of the plane with time .",
    "detectors would be placed above and below the storage region , and a time - dependent up - down asymmetry @xmath78 would be the signal of an edm , @xmath79 a simulation for @xmath80 cm is given in fig .",
    "[ fg : edmsig ] .     or @xmath81 ]",
    "the figure of merit for statistics in the edm experiment is the number of muons times the polarization . in order to reach @xmath82 cm ,",
    "the muon edm experiment would need @xmath83 , a flux only available at a future facility .",
    "while progress can still be made at brookhaven on @xmath20 , a dedicated muon edm experiment must be done elsewhere .",
    "measurements of the muon and electron anomalies played an important role in our understanding of sub - atomic physics in the 20th century .",
    "the electron anomaly was tied closely to the development of qed .",
    "the subsequent measurement of the muon anomaly showed that the muon was indeed a `` heavy electron '' which obeyed qed.@xcite with the sub - ppm accuracy now available for the muon anomaly,@xcite there may be indications that new physics is beginning to appear in loop processes.@xcite    the non - observation of an electron edm is becoming an issue for supersymmetry , just as the non - observation of a neutron edm implies such a mysteriously ( some would say un - naturally ) small @xmath84-parameter for qcd .",
    "the search for edms will continue , and if one is observed , the motivation for further searches in other systems will be even stronger .",
    "the muon presents a unique opportunity to observe an edm in a second - generation particle , where the _ cp _ phase might be different from the first generation , or the scaling with mass might be quadratic rather than linear .      if susy turns out to be _ the _ extension to the standard model , then there will be susy enhancements to @xmath20 to the muon edm and also to the amplitudes for lepton flavor violating muon decays .",
    "once the susy mass spectrum is measured , @xmath20 will provide a very clean measurement of @xmath85.@xcite    if susy or other new dynamics at the tev scale are not found at lhc , then precision experiments , which are sensitive through virtual loops to much higher mass scales than direct searches for new particles , become even more important .",
    "experiments such as edm searches , 2 and searches for lepton flavor violation , all carried out at high intensity facilities , may provide the only way to probe these higher energy scales .",
    "opportunities at future high intensity facilities are actively being pursued , and both the theoretical and experimental situations are evolving .",
    "it is clear that the study of lepton moments and lepton flavor violation , along with neutron edm searches , will continue to be a topic of great importance in the first part of the 21st century .",
