    "in a visionary paper written more than 40 years ago , @xcite argued that two important but otherwise unmeasurable parameters of microlensing events could be determined by simultaneously observing the event from the earth and a satellite in solar orbit . in modern language , these are the einstein radius projected onto the observer plane , @xmath2 , and the direction of lens - source relative proper motion . since the einstein timescale , @xmath3 ,",
    "is routinely measured for all events , these parameter determinations are equivalent to knowing the projected relative velocity , @xmath4 , whose magnitude is simply @xmath5 . here ,",
    "@xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the microlens parallax , @xmath10 is the mass of the lens , @xmath11 is the angular einstein radius , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are the lens - source relative parallax and proper motion , respectively , and @xmath14 .",
    "the practical importance of this suggestion became clear when the macho @xcite and eros @xcite collaborations reported the detection of microlensing events toward the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) .",
    "over the course of time , macho @xcite has found about 15 such events and argued that these imply that about 20% of the milky way dark halo is composed of compact objects ( `` machos '' ) , while eros @xcite has argued that their relative lack of such detections was consistent with all the events being due to stars in the milky way disk or the magellanic clouds ( mcs ) themselves . for any given individual event ,",
    "it is generally impossible to tell ( with only a measurement of @xmath3 ) where along the line of sight the lens lies , so one can not distinguish among the three possibilities : milky way disk , milky way halo , or `` self - lensing '' in which the source and lens both lie in the same external galaxy .",
    "however , as @xcite argued , measurement of @xmath4 might allow one to distinguish among these populations with good confidence : disk , halo , and mc lenses typically have @xmath15 values of @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , respectively . the high projected speed of mc lenses derives from the long `` lever arm '' that multiplies their small local transverse speed by the ratio of the distances from the observer and the lens to the source .",
    "there are serious obstacles , both practical and theoretical to measuring @xmath4 .",
    "one obvious practical problem is simply launching a spacecraft with a suitable camera into solar orbit .",
    "but the theoretical difficulties also place significant constraints on the characteristics of that spacecraft . to understand these properly",
    ", one should think in terms of the `` microlens parallax ''",
    "@xmath19 , whose magnitude is @xmath20 and whose direction is the same as @xmath4 .",
    "choosing a coordinate system whose @xmath21-axis is aligned with the earth - satellite separation at the peak of the event , we can write @xmath22 . then to good approximation , @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the earth - satellite separation ( projected onto the plane of the sky ) , @xmath25 is the difference in time of event maximum as seen from the earth and satellite , and @xmath26 is the difference in dimensionless impact parameter ( determined from the maximum observed magnification ) .",
    "@xcite already realized that equation ( [ eqn : pitaubeta ] ) implicitly contains a four - fold degeneracy : while @xmath27 is unambiguously determined , there are four different values of @xmath26 that depend on whether the individual impact parameters are positive or negative ( on one side of the lens or the other ; see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the situation is considerably worse than this .",
    "while @xmath28 is usually measured very precisely in individual microlensing events , @xmath29 typically has much larger errors because it is strongly correlated with three other parameters , the timescale , @xmath3 , the source flux @xmath30 , and the blended flux , @xmath31 . for a satellite separated by @xmath32 , and a projected einstein radius @xmath33 , errors in the impact - parameter determinations of only @xmath34 would lead to fractional errors @xmath35 .",
    "however , @xcite showed that if the two cameras had essentially identical spectral responses and similar point - spread - functions , so that one knew a priori that the blended light was virtually identical for the earth and satellite measurements , then the error in @xmath26 would be reduced far below the individual errors in @xmath29 , making the parallax determination once again feasible .",
    "unfortunately , this trick can not be used on _ spitzer _ , the first general purpose camera to be placed in solar orbit .",
    "the shortest wavelength at which _ spitzer _ operates is the @xmath36 band ( @xmath37 m ) , implying that the camera s sensitivity can not be duplicated from the ground , because of both higher background and different throughput as a function of wavelength .    in principle , microlens parallaxes can also be measured from the ground . as with space - based parallaxes , one component of @xmath19",
    "can generally be measured much more precisely than the other . for most events , @xmath38 , and for these",
    "the earth s acceleration can be approximated as constant during the event . to the degree",
    "that this acceleration is aligned ( anti - aligned ) with the lens - source relative motion , it induces an asymmetry in the light curve , since the event proceeds faster ( slower ) before peak than afterward @xcite .",
    "this is characterized by the `` asymmetry parameter '' @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is the apparent acceleration of the sun projected onto the sky and normalized to an au , and @xmath41 is the component of @xmath19 parallel to @xmath40 .",
    "since @xmath42 is directly measurable from the light curve , one can directly obtain 1-d parallax information @xmath43 for these events , while the orthogonal component @xmath44 is measured extremely poorly ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while there are a few exceptions @xcite , 2-d parallaxes can generally only be obtained for relatively long events @xmath45 , and even for these , the @xmath19 error ellipse is generally elongated in the @xmath44 direction @xcite .",
    "since _ spitzer _ is in an earth - trailing orbit and the smc is close to the ecliptic pole , the @xmath46 direction ( defined by the earth - satellite separation vector ) is very nearly orthogonal to the @xmath41 direction ( defined by the direction of the sun ) . recognizing this",
    ", @xcite advocated combining the two essentially 1-d parallaxes from the earth-_spitzer _ comparison and the accelerating earth alone to produce a single 2-d measurement of @xmath19 .",
    "he noted that once the difficult problem of measuring @xmath47 was jettisoned , the satellite observations could be streamlined to a remarkable degree : essentially only 3 observations were needed , 2 at times placed symmetrically around the peak , which are sensitive to the offset in @xmath28 between the earth and satellite , and a third at late times to set the flux scale .",
    "this streamlining is important from a practical point of view because target - of - opportunity ( too ) time on _ spitzer _ incurs a large penalty .",
    "@xcite noted that the components of @xmath19 measured by the two techniques were not exactly orthogonal but argued ( incorrectly as it turns out ) that this had no significant consequences for the experiment .",
    "we return to this point below .    here",
    "we analyze _ spitzer _ and ground - based observations of the microlensing event ogle-2005-smc-001 to derive the first microlens parallax measurement using this technique .",
    "on 2005 july 9 ( hjd@xmath48 hjd-2450000 = 3561.37 ) , the ogle - iii early warning system ( ews , @xcite ) alerted the astronomical community that ogle-2005-smc-001 ( @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) was a probable microlensing event , approximately 23 days ( and seven observations ) into the 2005 ogle - iii observing season for the smc .",
    "in fact , the ews issued an internal alert five days earlier , when there were only three 2005 points , but the ogle team reacted cautiously because of the high rate of questionable alerts toward the smc and because the source lies projected against a background galaxy , making it a potential supernova candidate .",
    "however , the event shows a modest , but unambiguous rise 140 days earlier , at the end of the 2004 season , which is inconsistent with a supernova , and the unmagnified source sits right in the middle of the red giant clump on the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) , with @xmath51 .",
    "moreover , the light curve is achromatic .",
    "these factors convinced us that this was genuine microlensing , leading us to exercise our _ spitzer _ too option , which consisted of three 2-hr observations : two placed symmetrically around the peak and one at the baseline .",
    "once this decision was made , ogle increased its density of coverage to 35 @xmath52-band observations per clear night .",
    "ogle observations were obtained using the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at las campanas observatory in chile , operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the photometry was reduced using the standard ogle - iii data pipeline @xcite based on the image subtraction technique , dia @xcite .",
    "also many @xmath53-band observations were obtained during the event for monitoring achromaticity .",
    "there are _ spitzer _ observations at four epochs ( not three , as originally envisaged ) .",
    "these were centered at 2005 july 15 ut 20:02:40 , 2005 august 25",
    "ut 12:44:25 , 2005 september 15 ut 20:13:53 , and 2005 november 29 ut 10:24:40 . the first , third , and fourth observations each lasted 2 hr and consisted of two sets of about 100 dithered exposures , each of 26.8 s. the second observation ( in august ) was 1 hr , consisting of one set of 99 dithered exposures , each of 26.8 s. it was obtained with director s discretionary time ( ddt ) .",
    "all four were carried out simultaneously at 3.6 and 5.8 @xmath54 m .",
    "however , the third observation ( which took place at relatively high magnification ) was supplemented by 30 minutes of very short exposures in all four infrared array camera ( irac ) filters to probe the detailed spectral energy distribution of the source .",
    "the reason for the additional ddt observation is discussed in detail in   [ sec : complications ] .",
    "as originally conceived , the experiment was to consist only of ogle and _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "however , unexpected complications led us to take additional data from other ground - based observatories as well as the _ hubble space telescope _ ( hst ) .",
    "initially , we obtained some data using the 1.3 m smarts ( former two micron all sky survey [ 2mass ] ) telescope at the cerro tololo inter - american observatory ( ctio ) in chile simply as a precaution against possible future problems with the ogle telescope .",
    "( in order to align different light curves , it is generally necessary that they have some overlap ; one can not wait for the problems to arise before beginning to take data .",
    ") however , as the event approached peak , we found that it could not be fit with a classical @xcite model , even when augmented by parallax .",
    "we therefore began to intensively observe the event from both the ogle and smarts telescopes in the hopes of obtaining enough data to determine the nature of the light curve anomaly .",
    "similar considerations led us to begin observations using the 0.35 m nustrini telescope at the auckland observatory in new zealand , which lies at a substantially different longitude and suffers from substantially different weather patterns from those experienced by the two chile telescopes .    additionally , several high - dispersion spectra were obtained at las campanas observatory using 6.5 m magellan and 2.5 m du pont telescopes with echelle spectrographs at different magnifications in order to check for potential radial - velocity variations in the spectra of the magnified source .    finally , the anomalous behavior made it prudent to get high - resolution images using _ hst _ , both to improve the modeling of blended light in the ground - based and _ spitzer _ images , and to determine whether the apparent ground - based source could actually be resolved into multiple sources .",
    "we had _ hst _ too time to complement low - resolution space - based microlensing parallax observations , which was originally to be applied to observations by _",
    "deep impact_. with the probability low that these would be triggered as originally planned , we applied this time to obtain two orbits of observations of ogle-2005-smc-001 .",
    "there were two epochs of @xmath55 exposures , on 2005 october 1 and 2006 may 17/18 , with exposure times of ( 300 , 200 , 351 , 351 , and 639 ) seconds .",
    "the infrared observations were then repeated on 2006 june 25 .",
    "errors from each ground - based observatory are rescaled to force @xmath56 per degree of freedom close to unity . for the ogle data",
    ", we find by inspecting the cumulative distribution of the normalized residuals @xmath57 , that the rescaling factor is not uniform over the data set . here",
    "@xmath58 is the error reported by ogle and @xmath59 is the deviation of the data from the model .",
    "we therefore rescale in 4 segments , which are separated at hjd = 2453100 , 2453576 , and 2453609 , with rescaling factors 1.4 , 1.9 , 3.6 , and 2.0 .",
    "we tested two other error - rescaling schemes , one with no rescaling and the other with uniform rescaling of the ogle data .",
    "we found that the solutions do not differ qualitatively when these alternate schemes are used .",
    "our scientific goals critically depend on obtaining high - precision irac photometry for each of the 4 epochs .",
    "[ sec : addobs ] .",
    "these 4 epochs are divided into 7 1-hour sub - epochs , each consisting of about 100 dithers , one sub - epoch for the second epoch and two for each of the other three epochs .",
    "based on photon statistics alone , the best possible precision would be about @xmath60 for the five sub - epochs near peak , and @xmath61 for the last two sub - epochs . however , there are three interrelated problems that must be overcome to even approach this potential .",
    "first , the images contain `` stripes '' produced by nearby bright stars , perhaps agb stars , which ( because the 3 near - peak observations took place over 60 days ) appear at several different rotation angles .",
    "indeed , we expended considerable effort repositioning each successive image to avoid having these stripes come too close to , or actually overlap , the microlensed target , but they inevitably did overlap some reference stars .",
    "second , the microlensed source is blended with a neighboring star within @xmath62 , which is easily resolved in _ hst _ images and clearly resolved in ogle images as well .",
    "third , this problem is significantly complicated by the well - known fact that irac 3.6 @xmath54 m images are undersampled .",
    "we apply the procedures of @xcite to perform aperture photometry on the basic calibrated data ( bcd ) , which includes array - location - dependent and `` pixel - phase '' photometric corrections at the few percent level .",
    "we choose 7 bright and isolated stars , which we select from the ogle images .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "frames are of course even better resolved , but they are too small to contain a big enough sample of reference stars .",
    "the centroid position of the target - star aperture on each of the ( roughly 100 ) bcd dithers is determined by aligning the comparison stars with the ogle coordinates .",
    "we determine the `` internal error '' for the target star and the comparison stars at each sub - epoch from the internal scatters in their measurements .",
    "this is typically very close to the photon limit .",
    "however , we find that the epoch - to - epoch scatter in the comparison stars is about 0.7% .",
    "while in principle this could be due to intrinsic variability , such variability is unlikely to be so pervasive at this level , particularly since any star showing variability in the @xmath52 band over several years was excluded as a reference star .",
    "hence , we attribute this variation to unknown epoch - to - epoch systematics , and we assume that these affect the target in the same way that they affect the reference stars . hence , we adopt 0.7% as our photometric error for each of the 7 _ spitzer _ sub - epochs",
    ".    we also attempted to do point - spread - function ( rather than aperture ) photometry , making use of `` point response functions '' available at the _ spitzer _ science center web site .",
    "however , we found that the reference stars showed greater scatter between sub - epochs with this approach and so adopted the results from aperture photometry .",
    "figure [ fig : pspl ] shows the ground - based light curve with a fit to a standard @xcite model .",
    "the residuals are severe .",
    "the model does not include parallax .",
    "however , models that include parallax are quite similar . in the period before the peak",
    ", we were constantly refitting the light curve with every new night s data in order to be able to predict the time of peak and thus the time of the second too observation ( which was supposed to be symmetric around the peak with the first ) .",
    "it became increasingly clear that the event was not standard microlensing , and we began to consider alternate possibilities , including binary source ( also called `` xallarap '' ) , binary lens , and variable source .",
    "the last was especially alarming because if the variability were irregular , it would be almost impossible to model at the high precision required to carry out this experiment , particularly because the source might vary differently at @xmath52 and @xmath36 .",
    "our concern about xallarap led us to obtain radial - velocity measurements at several epochs near the peak .",
    "these turned out to be the same within less than @xmath63 , which ruled out xallarap for all but the most pathologically face - on orbits . but regardless of the nature of the anomaly",
    ", it could potentially cause serious problems because much more and better data are required to accurately model complicated light curves compared to simple ones .",
    "hence , as described in ",
    "[ sec : obs ] , recognition of the anomaly caused us to significantly intensify our ground - based observations .",
    "moreover , it also caused us to think more carefully about how we would extract parallax information from a more complicated light curve , and this led us to recognize a complication that affects even light curves that do not suffer from additional anomalies .",
    "recall that @xmath64 is derived from the different peak time @xmath28 as seen from earth and _ spitzer _ : if the two _ spitzer _ observations are timed so that the fluxes seen at earth are equal to each other ( one on the rising and one on the falling wing of the light curve ) , then the _ spitzer _ fluxes will nevertheless be different , the first one being higher if the event peaks at _ spitzer _ before the earth .",
    "however , the two _ spitzer _ fluxes may differ not only because _ spitzer _ is displaced from the earth along the direction of lens - source relative motion , but also if it is displaced in the orthogonal direction by _ different amounts _ at the two epochs .",
    "@xcite recognized this possibility , but argued that the amplitude of this displacement could be determined from the measurement of @xmath41 , which is derived from the ground - based parallax measurement ( i.e. , from the asymmetry of the light curve ) .",
    "hence , he argued that it would be possible to correct for this additional offset and still obtain a good measurement of @xmath64 .",
    "unfortunately , while it is true that the _ amplitude _ can be so derived , the _ sign _ of this correction is more difficult to determine .",
    "the problem can be understood by considering the work of @xcite , who showed that ground - based microlensing parallaxes are subject to a two - fold degeneracy , essentially whether the source passes the lens on the same or opposite side of the earth compared to the sun . within the geocentric formalism of @xcite ,",
    "this amounts to switching the sign of the impact parameter @xmath29 ( which by convention is normally positive ) and leaving all other parameters essentially unchanged .",
    "@xcite derived this degeneracy under the assumption that the earth accelerates uniformly during the course of the event .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for short events , but is grossly incorrect for ogle-2005-smc-001 , with its timescale of @xmath65yr .",
    "nevertheless , this degeneracy can hold remarkably well even for relatively long events , particularly for @xmath66 .",
    "the sign of the correction to @xmath64 depends essentially on whether the _ absolute value _ of the impact parameter as seen from _",
    "spitzer _ is higher or lower than that seen from earth .",
    "while the _ algebraic _ displacement of _ spitzer _ along this direction can be predicted from the ground - based measurement of the parallax asymmetry ( just as @xcite argued ) , its effect on the absolute value of @xmath29 depends on whether @xmath29 is positive or negative .",
    "if the parallax is sufficiently large , then the ground - based light curve alone can determine the sign of @xmath29 , and if it is sufficiently small , the difference between the two solutions is also very small and may not be significant .",
    "however , for intermediate values of the parallax , this degeneracy can be important . to understand how an additional _ spitzer _ observation can help ,",
    "consider an idealized set of four observations , one at peak , one at baseline , and two symmetrically timed around peak ( as seen from earth ) .",
    "call these fluxes @xmath67 , @xmath31 , @xmath68 , and @xmath69 .",
    "consider now the ratio @xmath70/[(f_- + f_+)/2 - f_{\\rm b}]$ ] . if the impact parameter seen from _",
    "spitzer _ is higher than that from earth , this ratio will be lower for the _ spitzer _ data than for the ground - based data .",
    "( note that blended light , which may be different for the two sets of observations , cancels out of this expression . ) in practice , we found from simulations that it was not necessary to have the three observations timed so perfectly .",
    "hence , it was possible to plan both the additional ddt observation , as well as the second too observation to occur during regularly scheduled irac campaigns , so there was no 6.5 hour penalty for either observation .",
    "hence , the net cost to _ spitzer _",
    "time was less than would have been the case for a single precisely timed too observation .    in brief",
    ", the above considerations demonstrate that the @xcite technique requires a total of four observations , not three as originally proposed .",
    "moreover , these observations do not have to be so precisely timed as @xcite originally imagined .",
    "see figure  [ fig : degen ] for a visual explanation of these arguments .      ultimately , we found that the anomaly was caused by a binary lens .",
    "binary lenses are subject to their own discrete degeneracies .",
    "this means that analysis of the event is impacted by two distinct classes of discrete degeneracies : those due to parallax and thoese due to binarity .",
    "the discrete parallax degeneracy , as summarized in ",
    "[ sec : addobs ] , takes the impact parameter @xmath71 and ( because @xmath72 ) leaves other parameters changed by very little ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the discrete binary degeneracy is between wide and close binaries . here",
    "`` wide '' means @xmath73 and `` close '' means @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the angular separation between the two binary components in units of @xmath11 , ( for which we give and justify our convention in   [ sec : statparms ] ) .",
    "it gives @xmath76 , @xmath77 and leaves other parameters roughly unchanged .",
    "here @xmath78 is the mass ratio of the lens , with the convention that for @xmath79 , the component closer to the source trajectory goes in the denominator of the ratio . in both cases ,",
    "the central magnification pattern is dominated by a 4-cusp caustic .",
    "this degeneracy was first discovered empirically by @xcite and theoretically by @xcite and can be incredibly severe despite the fact that the two caustics are far from identical : the solutions can remain indistinguishable even when there are two well - observed caustic crossings @xcite .    in the present case , the deviations from a simple lens are not caused by caustic crossings , but rather by a close approach to a cusp , which makes this degeneracy even more severe .",
    "in fact , the caustic is symmetric enough that the approach may almost equally well be to either of two adjacent cusps .",
    "that is , the cusp degeneracy would be `` perfect '' if the cusp were four - fold symmetric , and it is only the deviation from this symmetry that leads to distinct solutions for different cusp approaches .    in brief , the lens geometry is subject to an 8-fold discrete degeneracy , 2-fold for parallax , 2-fold for wide / close binary , and 2-fold for different cusp approaches .",
    "of course all binaries are in kepler orbits , but it is usually possible to ignore this motion in binary - lens analyses . stated less positively , it is rarely possible to constrain any binary orbital parameters from microlensing light curves . in",
    "the few known exceptions , @xcite , the light curve contained several well - measured caustic crossings that pinned down key times in the trajectory to @xmath80 of an einstein crossing time .",
    "hence , we did not expect to measure binary rotation in the present case in which there are no such crossings .",
    "we were nevertheless led to investigate rotation by the following circumstance .",
    "when we initially analyzed the event using only ground - based data , we found that the best fit ( for all 8 discrete solutions ) had negative blended light , roughly @xmath81 of the source light , but with large errors and thus consistent with zero at the @xmath82 level .",
    "this was not unexpected .",
    "as mentioned in   [ sec : intro ] , the component of the microlens parallax perpendicular to the sun , @xmath44 , is generally poorly constrained by ground - based data alone .",
    "the reason for this is that small changes in @xmath44 , the einstein timescale @xmath3 , the impact parameter @xmath29 , the source flux @xmath30 , and the blended flux , @xmath31 , all induce distortions in the light curve that are symmetric about the peak , and hence all these parameters are correlated .",
    "thus , the large errors ( and consequent possible negative values ) of @xmath31 are just the obverse of the large errors in @xmath44 .",
    "indeed , this is the reason for adding in _ spitzer _ observations .",
    "however , we found that when the _ spitzer _ observations were added , the blending errors were indeed reduced , but the actual value of the blending remained highly negative , near @xmath81 .",
    "this prompted us to look for other physical effects that could induce distortions in the light curve that might masquerade as negative blending .",
    "first among these was binary orbital motion . before discussing this motion",
    ", we first review microlensing by static binaries .",
    "point - lens microlensing is described by three geometric parameters , the impact parameter @xmath29 ( smallest lens - source angular separation in units of @xmath11 ) , the time at which the separation reaches this minimum @xmath28 , and the einstein crossing time @xmath7 , where @xmath54 is the lens - source relative proper motion .    in binary lensing",
    ", there are three additional parameters , the projected separation of the components ( in units of @xmath11 ) @xmath75 , the mass ratio of the components @xmath78 , and the angle of the source - lens trajectory relative to the binary axis , @xmath83 .",
    "moreover the first three parameters now require more precise definition because there is no longer a natural center to the system .",
    "one must therefore specify where the center of the system is .",
    "then @xmath29 becomes the closest approach to this center and @xmath28 the time of this closest approach .",
    "finally , @xmath3 is usually taken to be the time required to cross the einstein radius defined by the _ combined _ mass of the two components .",
    "in fact , while computer programs generally adopt some fairly arbitrary point ( such as the midpoint between the binaries or the binary center of mass ) , the symmetries of individual events can make other choices much more convenient .",
    "that is certainly the case here .",
    "moreover , symmetry considerations that are outlined below will also lead us to adopt a somewhat non - standard @xmath3 for the wide - binary case , namely the timescale associated with the mass that is closer to the source trajectory , rather than the total mass . to be consistent with this choice",
    ", we also express @xmath75 as the separation between wide components in units of the einstein radius associated with the nearest mass ( rather than the total mass ) .    as is clear from figure [ fig : pspl ]",
    ", the light curve is only a slightly perturbed version of standard ( point - lens ) microlensing , which means that it is generated either by the source passing just outside the central caustic of a close binary ( that surrounds both components ) or just outside one of the two caustics of a wide binary ( each associated with one component ) . in either case , the standard point - lens parameters @xmath29 and @xmath28 will be most closely reproduced if the lens center is placed at the so - called `` center of magnification '' . for close binaries",
    "this lies at the binary center of mass . for wide binaries ,",
    "it lies @xmath84 from the component that is closer to the trajectory .",
    "hence , it is separated by approximately @xmath85 from the center of mass",
    ". this will be important in deriving equation  ( [ eqn : alphapi ] ) , below",
    ".    for light curves passing close to the diamond caustic of a close binary , the standard einstein timescale ( corresponding to the total mass ) will be very close to the timescale derived from the best - fit point lens of the same total mass .",
    "however , for wide binaries , the standard einstein timescale is longer by a factor @xmath86 , where @xmath78 is the ratio of companion ( whether heavier or lighter ) to the component that is approached most closely .",
    "this is because the magnification is basically due just to this latter component ( with the companion contributing only minor deviations via its shear ) , while the usual einstein radius is based on the _ total _ mass . for wide binaries",
    ", we therefore adopt an einstein radius and einstein timescale reduced by this same factor .",
    "the advantage of adopting these parameter definitions is that , being fairly well fixed by the empirical light curve , they are only weakly correlated with various other parameters , some of which are relatively poorly determined .",
    "while close and wide binaries can be ( and in the present case are ) almost perfectly degenerate in the static case , binary orbital motion has a radically different effect on their respective light curves .",
    "note first that while 7 parameters would be required to fully describe the binary orbital motion , even in the best of cases it has not proven possible to constrain more than 4 of them @xcite .",
    "two of these have already been mentioned , i.e. , @xmath75 and @xmath78 , from the static case .",
    "for the two binaries for which additional parameters have been measured , these have been taken to be a uniform rotation rate @xmath87 and a uniform binary - expansion rate @xmath88 .",
    "this choice is appropriate for close binaries because for these , the center of mass is the same as the center of magnification .",
    "hence the primary effects of binary motion are rotation of the magnification pattern around the center of magnification and the change of the magnification pattern due to changing separation",
    ". both of these changes may be ( probably are ) nonuniform , but as the light curves are insensitive to such subtleties , the simplest approximation is uniform motion .",
    "however , the situation is substantially more complicated for wide binaries , consideration of which leads to a different parameterization .",
    "recall that the wide - binary center of magnification is not at the center of mass , and indeed is close to one of the components .",
    "hence , as the binary rotates , the center of magnification rotates basically with that component .",
    "nominally , the biggest effect of this rotation is the resulting roughly linear motion of the lens center of magnification relative to the source .",
    "however , the linear component of this motion , i.e. , the first derivative of the motion at the peak of the event , is _ already _ subsumed in the source - lens relative motion in the static - binary fit .",
    "the first new piece of information about the binary orbital motion is the second derivative of this motion , i.e. , the acceleration .",
    "note that the direction of this acceleration is known : it is along the binary axis .",
    "moreover , for wide binaries , kepler s third law predicts that the periods will typically be much longer than the einstein timescale , so to a reasonable approximation , this direction remains constant during the event .",
    "we designate the acceleration ( in einstein radii per unit time squared ) as @xmath89 .",
    "the parameter @xmath89 is related to the distance to the lens in a relatively straightforward way . for simplicity , assume for the moment that the center of magnification is right at the position of the component that is closer to the source trajectory ( instead of just near it ) .",
    "the 3-dimensional acceleration of the component is @xmath90 , where @xmath91 is the mass of the companion to the closer component , @xmath92 is the physical einstein radius , and @xmath93 is the angle between the binary axis and the line of sight .",
    "hence , @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the mass of the closer component .",
    "this can be simplified with the aid of the following three identities : 1 ) @xmath96 , 2 ) @xmath97 , 3 ) @xmath98 . here",
    "@xmath99 and @xmath100 are the distances to the lens and source , and @xmath101 .",
    "we then find , @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the shear .",
    "note that the shear determines the size of the caustic and so is one of the parameters that is most robustly determined from the light curve . if we were to take account of the offset between @xmath95 and the center of magnification , the r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( [ eqn : alphapi ] ) would change fractionally by the order of @xmath104 .",
    "thus , the model requires a total of 10 geometrical parameters in addition to the 8 flux parameters ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 for each of the 3 ground - based observatories plus _ spitzer _ ) .",
    "these are the three standard microlensing parameters , @xmath105 ( the time of closest approach , separation at closest approach in units of @xmath11 , and einstein timescale ) , the three additional static - binary parameters @xmath106 ( the binary separation in units of @xmath11 , the binary mass ratio , and the angle of the source trajectory relative to the binary axis ) , the two binary - orbit parameters , @xmath88 and either @xmath87 ( close ) or @xmath89 ( wide ) , and the two parallax parameters , @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 represent the north and east directions .",
    "these must be specified for 8 different classes of solutions .",
    "we combine two techniques to identify all viable models of the observed microlensing light curve : stepping through parameter space on a grid ( grid - search ) and markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) @xcite .",
    "we begin with the simplest class of binary models , i.e. , without parallax or rotation .",
    "hence , there are six geometric parameters , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath3 , @xmath75 , @xmath78 , and @xmath83 .",
    "we consider classes of models with @xmath110 held fixed , and vary @xmath111 to minimize @xmath56 .",
    "( note that for each trial model , @xmath30 and @xmath31 can be determined algebraically from a linear fit , so their evaluations are trivial . )",
    "this approach identifies four solutions , i.e. ( 2 cusp - approaches)@xmath112(wide / close degeneracy ) .",
    "we then introduce parallax , and so step over models with @xmath113 held fixed , working in the neighborhood of the @xmath110 minima found previously .",
    "the introduction of parallax brings with it the @xmath114 degeneracy , and so there are now 8 classes of solutions .",
    "next we introduce rotation .",
    "we begin by employing grid search and find , somewhat surprisingly , that several of the eight ( close / wide , @xmath114 , on / off - axis cusp ) classes of solutions have more than one minimum in @xmath115 for close binaries or @xmath116 for wide binaries .",
    "we then use each of these solutions as seeds for mcmc and find several additional minima that were too close to other minima to show up in the grid search .",
    "altogether there are 20 separate minima , 12 for close binaries and 8 for wide binaries .",
    "we use mcmc to localize our solutions accurate to about @xmath117 and to determine the covariance matrix of the parameters . in mcmc ,",
    "one moves randomly from one point in parameter space to another .",
    "if the @xmath56 is lower , the new point is added to the `` chain '' .",
    "if not , one draws a random number and adds the new point only if this number is lower than relative probability ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "if the parameters are highly correlated ( as they are in microlensing ) and the random trial points are chosen without reference ( or without proper reference ) to these covariances , then the overwhelming majority of trial points are rejected .",
    "we therefore sample parameter space based on the covariance matrix drawn from the previous `` links '' in the chain . during the initial `` burning in '' stage of the mcmc",
    ", we frequently evaluate the covariance matrix ( every 100 `` links '' ) until it stabilizes .",
    "then we hold the covariance matrix fixed in the simulation @xcite . from the standpoint of finding the best @xmath56",
    ", one can combine linear fits for the flux parameters @xmath30 and @xmath31 with mcmc for the remaining parameters .",
    "however , since part of our mcmc objective is to find the covariances , we treat @xmath119 as mcmc parameters while fitting for the remaining four flux parameters analytically .    in order to reduce the correlations among search parameters , we introduce the following parameter combinations into the search : @xmath120 , @xmath121 , @xmath122 , and @xmath123 ( wide ) or @xmath124 ( close ) . because these are directly related to features in the light curve , they are less prone to variation than the naive model parameters .",
    "the effective timescale @xmath125 is @xmath126 of the full - width at half - maximum , @xmath127 is just the flux at baseline , and @xmath128 is the flux at maximum .",
    "the scale of the @xcite distortion ( which governs the binary perturbation ) is given by the shear @xmath129 for wide binaries and by the quadrupole @xmath130 for close binaries .",
    "the mcmc `` chain '' automatically samples points in the neighborhood of the minimum with probability density proportional to their likelihoods , @xmath131 .",
    "somewhat paradoxically , this means that for higher - dimensional problems , it does not actually get very close to the minimum .",
    "specifically , for a chain of length @xmath108 sampling an @xmath132-dimensional space , there will be only one point for which @xmath133 ( relative to the minimum ) obeys @xmath134 , where @xmath135=n^{-1}$ ] .",
    "hence , for @xmath136 one requires a chain of length @xmath137 to reach @xmath117 above the true minimum , or @xmath138 for @xmath139 .",
    "further improvements scale only as @xmath140 .",
    "hence , to find the true minimum , we construct chains in which the rejection criterion is calculated based on @xmath141 rather than @xmath131 . however , when calculating error bars and covariances , or when integrating over the mcmc , we use the @xmath131 chain .",
    "a general problem in mcmc fitting is to determine how well the solution `` converges '' , that is , how precisely the `` best fit '' solution is reproduced when the initial seed solution is changed . in our case ,",
    "the problem is the opposite : mcmc clearly does not converge to a single minimum , and the challenge is to find all the local minima .",
    "we described our procedure for meeting this challenge above , first by identifying 8 distinct regions of parameter space semi - analytically , and then exploring these with different mcmc seeds .",
    "this procedure led to well - defined minima ( albeit a plethora of them ) , whose individual structures were examined by putting boundaries into the mcmc code that prevented the chain from `` drifting '' into other minima .",
    "we halted our subdivision of parameter space when the structure on the @xmath56 surface fell to of order @xmath142 , regarding the @xmath143 region as the zone of convergence .",
    "as mentioned above , we located the final minimum by artificially decreasing the errors by a factor of 5 , again making certain that the resulting ( exaggerated ) @xmath56 surface was well behaved .",
    "table 1 gives parameter values and errors for a total of 20 different discrete solutions , which are labeled by ( c / w ) for close / wide binary , ( @xmath144/@xmath145 ) for the sign of @xmath29 , ( @xmath146/@xmath147 ) for solutions that are approximately parallel or perpendicular to the binary axis , and then by alphabetical sequential for different viable combinations of rotation parameters . in table 1 , we allow a free fit to blending .    note that some solutions have severe negative blending .",
    "while it is possible in principle that these are due to systematic errors , the fact that other solutions have near - zero blending and low @xmath56 implies that the negative - blending solutions probably have lens geometries that do not correspond to the actual lens .",
    "other solutions have relatively high @xmath56 and so are also unlikely .",
    "solutions with @xmath56 that is less than 9 above the minimum have their @xmath56 displayed in boldface , while the remaining solutions are shown in normal type .",
    "there are several reasons to believe that the blending is close to zero .",
    "first , the source appears isolated on our @xmath148-band nicmos _ hst _ images , implying that if it is blended , this blended light must be within of order 100 mas of the source .",
    "as the density of sources in the _ hst _ images is low , this is a priori very unlikely unless the blended light comes from a companion to the source or the lens .",
    "moreover , all the near neighbors of the source on the _ hst _ image are separately resolved by the ogle photometry , so if there is blended light in the ogle photometry then it must also be blended in the _ hst _ images .",
    "second , the @xmath149 color of the source , which can be derived by a model - independent regression of @xmath53 flux on @xmath52 flux , is identical within measurement error to the color of the baseline light from the combined source and ( possible ) blend .",
    "this implies that either 1 ) the source is unblended , 2 ) it is blended by another star of nearly the same color as the source , or 3 ) it is blended by a star that is so faint that it hardly contributes to the color of the blend . the second possibility is strongly circumscribed by the following argument . the source is a clump star . on the smc cmd",
    ", there are first ascent giants of color similar to the source from the clump itself down to the subgiant branch about 2.5 mag below the clump .",
    "thus , in principle , the blended light could lie in the range @xmath150 without causing the baseline color to deviate from the source color . however , there are no solutions in table 1 with blending this high .",
    "there is one low-@xmath56 solution with @xmath151 , but this would be 3 mag below the clump and so below the subgiant branch .",
    "if we restrict the blend to turnoff colors , i.e. , @xmath152 , then the color constraint implies @xmath153 , which is negligibly small from our perspective .",
    "thus , while it is possible in principle that the source is blended with a reddish subgiant , the low stellar density in the _ hst _ image , the low frequency of such subgiants on the cmd , and the difficulty of matching color constraints even with such a star , combine to make this a very unlikely possibility .",
    "we therefore conduct the primary analysis assuming zero blending , as listed in table 2 . again",
    ", the @xmath154 solutions are marked in boldface .",
    "note that most solutions in table 1 are reasonably consistent with zero blending , which is the expected behavior for the true solution provided it is not corrupted by systematic errors .",
    "for these , the @xmath56 changes only modestly from table 1 to table 2 .",
    "however , several solutions simply disappear from table 2 .",
    "this is because , in some cases , forcing the blending to zero has the effect of merging two previously distinct binary - rotation minima .",
    "the main parameters of interests are @xmath19 and the closely related quantity @xmath155 . however , for reasons that will be explained below , @xmath155 can be reliably calculated only for the close solutions , but not the wide solutions .",
    "hence , we focus first on @xmath19 .    figure  [ fig : pie ] shows error ellipses for all solutions , color - coded by according to @xmath133 relative to the global minimum .",
    "the right - hand panels show the solutions presented in tables 1 and 2 , which include the _ spitzer _ data .",
    "the left - hand panels exclude these data .",
    "the upper panels are based on a free fit for blending whereas the lower panels are constrained to zero blending for the ogle dataset . comparing the two upper panels ,",
    "it is clear that when blending is a fitted parameter , the _",
    "data reduce the errors in the @xmath44 direction by about a factor of 3 . however , once the blending is fixed ( lower panels ) , the _ spitzer _",
    "data have only a modest additional effect .",
    "this is expected since @xmath44 is correlated with blending and one can simultaneously constrain both parameters either by constraining @xmath44 with _ spitzer _ data or just by fixing the blending by hand .",
    "figure [ fig : bestfit ] shows the best overall zero - blending fit to the data .",
    "all eight wide solutions are effectively excluded .",
    "when a free fit to blending is allowed , their @xmath56 values are already significantly above the minimum .",
    "when zero blending is imposed , only five independent solutions survive and those that have negative blending are driven still higher . in all five cases to @xmath156 .",
    "eight of the 11 close solutions survive the imposition of zero blending . of these",
    ", only one has @xmath157 , and only another two have @xmath158 relative to the best zero - blending solution .",
    "we focus primarily on these three , which all have best - fit parallaxes in the range @xmath159 and projected velocities in the range @xmath160 .",
    "these projected velocities are of the order expected for halo lenses but are about 1 order of magnitude smaller than those expected for smc self lensing .",
    "note that because there are multiple solutions , the errors in @xmath161 are highly non - gaussian and are best judged directly from figures [ fig : lambdasmc ] and [ fig : lambdahalo ] ( below ) rather than quoting a formal error bar .",
    "when @xcite made the first measurement of microlensing parallax , they developed a purely kinematic method of estimating the lens distance ( and thus mass ) based on comparison of the measured value of @xmath162 with the expected kinematic properties of the underlying lens population .",
    "starting from this same approach , @xcite devised a test that uses the microlens parallax measurement to assign relative probabilities to different lens populations ( e.g. , smc , galactic halo , galactic disk ) based solely on the _ kinematic _ characteristics of these populations , and without making prior assumptions about either the mass function or the density normalization of any population .",
    "this is especially useful because , while a plausible guess can be given for the mass function and normalization of smc lenses , nothing is securely known about a putative galactic halo population . in the present case ,",
    "the high projected velocity @xmath15 immediately rules out galactic - disk lenses , so we restrict consideration to the other two possibilities .",
    "we begin by recapitulating the @xcite test in somewhat more general form .",
    "the differential rate of microlensing events of fixed mass @xmath10 ( per steradian ) is @xmath163 where @xmath164 and @xmath165 are the two - dimensional normalized velocity distributions of the lenses and sources , @xmath166 and @xmath167 are the density distributions of the lenses and sources , @xmath15 is an implicit function of @xmath168 , and @xmath2 is an implicit function of @xmath169 .",
    "the method is simply to evaluate the likelihood @xmath170 \\over\\int d^2 v_\\l\\ , d^2 v_\\s d d_\\l d d_\\s\\ , d^{(6)}\\gamma(m ) } \\label{eqn : likerat}\\ ] ] for each population separately , and then take the ratio of likelihoods for the two populations : @xmath171 . here , @xmath172 is the difference of @xmath56 relative to the global minimum that is derived from the microlensing light curve .",
    "note that all dependence on @xmath10 disappears from @xmath173 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : likerat ] ) can be simplified in different ways for each population . in both cases ,",
    "we express the result in terms of @xmath174 , @xmath175 rather than @xmath162 , because it is better behaved in the neighborhood of @xmath176 , just as trigonometric parallax is better behaved near zero than its inverse , distance .      for halo lenses ,",
    "the depth of the smc is small compared to @xmath177 and the internal dispersion of smc sources is small compared to the bulk motion of the smc .",
    "hence , one can essentially drop the three integrations over smc sources , implying @xmath178 where @xmath179 , @xmath180 , and @xmath181 are the velocities of the lens , the `` geocentric frame '' , and the smc ( all in the galactic frame ) projected on the plane of the sky .",
    "the `` geocentric frame '' is the frame of the earth at the time of the peak of the event .",

    "is an appropriate approximation because the smc velocity dispersion is small compared to its bulk velocity and @xmath199 .",

    "one must estimate @xmath202 as well as the smc density @xmath209 along the line of sight , which is required to compute @xmath210 .",
    "this requires an investigation of the structure of the smc .",
    "in sharp contrast to its classic `` magellanic irregular '' appearance in blue light , the smc is essentially a dwarf elliptical galaxy whose old population is quite regular in both its density @xcite and velocity @xcite distributions .",
    "@xcite find that after removing an overall gradient ( more below ) , the observed radial velocity distribution is well fit by a gaussian with @xmath211 , which does not vary significantly over their @xmath212 ( ra , dec ) field .",

    "the @xmath211 dispersion reported by @xcite includes measurement errors .",
    "when the reported errors ( typically @xmath216 per star ) are included in the fit , this is reduced to @xmath217",
    ". however , these reported errors may well be too generous : the statistical errors ( provided by d.  zaritsky 2006 , private communication ) are typically only 23@xmath218 , the reported errors being augmented to account for systematic errors .",
    "if the statistical errors are used , we find @xmath219 .",
    "d.  zaritsky ( 2006 , private communication ) advocates an intermediate value for this purpose , which leads to @xmath220 .",
    "the old stellar population in the smc is rotating at most very slowly .",
    "@xcite report a gradient across the smc of @xmath221 , which they note is a combination of the traverse velocity of the smc and the solid - body component of internal bulk motion . as the smc proper motion was poorly determined at the time , @xcite did not attempt to disentangle these two .",
    "however , @xcite have now measured the smc proper motion to be @xmath222 .",
    "we refit the @xcite data and find @xmath223 .",
    "subtracting these two measurements ( including errors and covariances ) we obtain a net internal rotation of @xmath224 with a position angle of @xmath225 .",
    "since this rotation is due north - south ( within errors ) , a direction for which the data have a baseline of only @xmath226 , and since solid - body rotation is unlikely to extend much beyond the core , it appears that the amplitude of rotational motion is only about @xmath227 , which is very small compared to the dispersion , @xmath202 .",
    "hence , we ignore it .",
    "in addition , we note that this rotation is misaligned with the hi rotation axis @xcite by about @xmath228 , so its modest statistical significance may indicate that it is not real .    as we describe below , our likelihood estimates are fairly sensitive to the tidal radius @xmath213 of the smc",
    ". proper determination of the tidal radius is a complex problem .",
    "early studies , made before dark matter was commonly accepted , were carried out for kepler potentials and in analogy with stellar and solar - system problems ( e.g.  @xcite ) . @xcite",
    "have calculated tidal radii for a range of potentials and also for an orbital parameter @xmath229 that ranges from @xmath230 for retrograde to @xmath231 for prograde .",
    "we choose @xmath232 as representative and evaluate their expression for an isothermal potential and for the satellite being close to pericenter ( as is appropriate for the smc ) : @xmath233 here , @xmath234 is the ratio of the apocenter to the pericenter of the satellite orbit , @xmath235 is the pericenter distance , and @xmath236 and @xmath237 are the respective _ halo _ velocity dispersions . because we adopt an @xmath238 profile , the smc halo velocity dispersion is larger than its stellar dispersion by @xmath239 , implying that @xmath240 .",
    "we adopt @xmath241 based on typical orbits found by @xcite , which yields @xmath242 .",
    "note , moreover , that at @xmath241 , @xmath243 , so the tidal radius is not very sensitive to the assumed properties of the orbit .",
    "the most critical input to the likelihood calculation is the stellar density along the line of sight . of course",
    ", images of the smc give direct information only about its surface density as a function of position .",
    "one important clue to how the two are related comes from the hi velocity map of @xcite , which shows an inclined rotating disk with the receding side at a position angle of @xmath244 ( north through east ) .",
    "this is similar to the @xmath245 position angle of the old - star optical profile found by @xcite based on data from @xcite .",
    "hence , the spheroidal old - stellar population is closely aligned to the hi disk , although ( as argued above ) the stars in the smc are pressure- rather than rotationally - supported .",
    "our best clue to the line - of - sight profile is the major - axis profile exterior to the position of the source , which lies about @xmath246 to the southwest of the galaxy center , roughly along the apparent major axis .",

    "binaries move in kepler orbits . in principle , if we could measure all the kepler parameters then these , together with the measured microlens parallax @xmath19 ( and the approximately known source distance @xmath265 ) , would fix the mass and distance to the lens . while the two orbital parameters that we measure are not sufficient to determine the lens mass and distance , they do permit us to put constraints on these quantities .",
    "consider first the special case of a face - on binary in a circular orbit .",
    "kepler s third law implies that @xmath266 where @xmath10 is the mass of the lens , @xmath75 is the binary separation in units of the local einstein radius @xmath92 , and @xmath87 is the measured rotation parameter .",
    "since @xmath267 , this implies , @xmath268 if one considers other orientations but remains restricted to face - on orbits , then this equation becomes a ( `` greater than '' ) inequality because at fixed projected separation , the apparent angular speed can only decrease .    further relaxing to the case of non - circular orbits but with @xmath269 ( i.e. , the event takes place at pericenter ) , the rhs of equation  ( [ eqn : faceoncirc ] ) is halved , @xmath270 , because escape speed ( appropriate for near - parabolic orbits ) is @xmath271 larger than circular speed .",
    "finally , after some algebra , and again working in the parabolic limit , one finds that including non - zero radial motion leads to @xmath272/2 $ ] , and thus to @xmath273^{-1}. \\label{eqn : genorbit}\\ ] ]    if the rhs of this equation is sufficiently small , then only lenses that are near the sun ( @xmath274 ) or near the smc ( @xmath199 ) will satisfy it . in practice , we find that this places no constraint on smc lenses , but does restrict halo lenses to be relatively close to the sun , with the limit varying from @xmath275 to @xmath276 depending on the particular solution being probed and the mcmc realization of that solution . integrating over the entire markov chain , we find that @xmath277 is reduced by a factor three , from 27.4 to 11.2 .      as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : wide ] , all wide solutions are ruled out by their high @xmath56 . nevertheless , for completeness it is instructive to ask what sort of constraints could be put on the lens from measurement of the acceleration parameter @xmath89 if these solutions had been accepted as viable .",
    "we rewrite equation  ( [ eqn : alphapi ] ) in terms of the parameter combination @xmath278 , which has units of time , @xmath279    the five wide - binary zero - blending solutions listed in table 2 have , respectively , @xmath280 yr .",
    "thus , if these solutions had been viable , the lens would have been firmly located in the smc ( or else , improbably , within 6 pc of the sun ) .",
    "this demonstrates the power of this constraint for wide binaries , which derives from light - curve features that arise from the motion of the center of magnification relative to the center of mass .",
    "these obviously do not apply to close binaries for which the center of magnification is identical to the center of mass",
    ".    however , this same relative motion makes it _ more difficult _ to constrain the nature of the lens from measurements of the projected velocity , @xmath162 .",
    "this is because the parallax measurement directly yields only the projected velocity of the center of magnification , whereas models of the lens populations constrain the motion of the center of mass .",
    "if @xmath88 is measured , it is straight forward to determine the component of the difference between these two that is parallel to the binary axis , namely @xmath281    on the other hand , the measurement of @xmath89 indicates that there is motion in the transverse direction , but specifies neither the amplitude nor sign .",
    "for example , for circular motion with the line of nodes perpendicular to the binary axis , @xmath282 and hence , @xmath283 if this ratio ( modulo the @xmath284 term ) is small , then the internal motion can be ignored ( assuming the inclination is not unluckily low ) . in the present case , the quantity @xmath285^{1/2}t_\\e$ ] for the five respective wide - binary solutions shown in table 2 is ( 0.23,0.36,0.25,1.04,0.77 ) , implying that constraints arising from measurement of @xmath15 would be significantly weakened .",
    "again , however , since the wide solutions are in fact ruled out , all of these results are of interest only for purposes of illustration .",
    "finite source effects are parameterized by @xmath286 , where @xmath287 is the angular size of the source .",
    "equivalently , @xmath288 , where @xmath289 is the physical source radius .",
    "since the source is a clump giant , with @xmath290 , this implies @xmath291 all models described above assume @xmath292 .",
    "since the impact parameter is @xmath293 and the semi - diameter of the caustic is @xmath294 , finite source effects should be pronounced for @xmath295 .",
    "in fact , we find that zero - blending models with @xmath296 are contraindicated by @xmath297 .",
    "this further militates against smc lenses , which predict acceptable values of @xmath298 only for relatively large source - lens separations .",
    "if we penalize solutions with finite source effects by @xmath299 , we find that @xmath277 rises from 11.2 to 20.3 .",
    "by combining ground - based and _ spitzer _ data , we have measured the microlensing parallax accurate to 0.003 units , by far the best parallax measurement yet for an event seen toward the magellanic clouds .",
    "our analysis significantly favors a halo location for the lens over smc self lensing .",
    "it excludes altogether lensing by galactic disk stars .",
    "of course , with only one event analyzed using this technique , an smc location can not be absolutely excluded based on the @xmath300 probability that we have derived . the technique must be applied to more events before firm conclusions can be drawn . _",
    "spitzer _ itself could be applied to this task .",
    "even better would be observations by the _ space interferometry mission ( sim ) _",
    "@xcite , for which time is already allocated for 5 magellanic cloud events . _",
    "sim _ would measure both @xmath19 and @xmath11 and so determine ( rather than statistically constrain ) the position of the lens .    assuming that the lens is in the halo , what are its likely properties ?",
    "the mass is @xmath301 where the fiducial @xmath9 is the best - fit value and the fiducial @xmath12 is for a `` typical '' halo lens , which ( after taking account of the constraint developed in   [ sec : closeconstraints ] ) would lie at about 5 kpc . in the best - fit model",
    ", the mass ratio is @xmath302 , which would imply primary and secondary masses of 7.3 and 2.7 @xmath303 respectively",
    ". the projected separation would be @xmath304 einstein radii , i.e. , @xmath305 .",
    "note that at these relatively close distances , main - sequence stars in this mass range would shine far too brightly to be compatible with the strict constraints on blended light .",
    "hence , the lenses would have to be black holes .",
    "we must emphasize that the test carried out here _ uses only kinematic attributes _ of the lens populations and assumes no prior information about _ their mass functions_. note , in particular , that if we were to adopt as a priori the lens mass distribution inferred by the macho experiment @xcite , then the macho hypothesis would be strongly excluded .",
    "recall from ",
    "[ sec : closeconstraints ] ( eq .  [",
    "[ eqn : genorbit ] ] ) , that the lens is either very close to the smc or within 10 kpc of the sun .",
    "however , from equation ( [ eqn : halomass ] ) , for @xmath306 , we have @xmath307 , and hence a primary mass @xmath308 . from figures 1214 of @xcite ,",
    "such masses are strongly excluded as the generators of the microlensing events they observed toward the lmc .",
    "hence , if the macho hypothesis favored by this single event is correct , the macho population must have substantially different characteristics from those inferred by @xcite , in particular , as mentioned above , a mass scale of order @xmath309 or perhaps more .",
    "@xcite limit the halo fraction of such objects to @xmath310 at @xmath311 and to @xmath312 at @xmath313 . at higher masses ,",
    "the sensitivity of microlensing surveys deteriorates drastically .",
    "however , @xcite derived important limits in this mass range from the distribution of wide binaries in the stellar halo , putting an upper limit at 100% for @xmath314 and at 20% for @xmath315 .",
    "thus , if the macho hypothesis is ultimately confirmed , this would be a new population in the mass `` window '' identified in figure 7 of @xcite between the limits set by microlensing and wide - binary surveys .",
    "this again argues for the importance of obtaining space - based parallaxes on additional microlensing events .    as we discussed in some detail in ",
    "[ sec : smcstruct ] ( particularly the last paragraph ) our conclusion regarding the relatively low probability of the lens being in the smc rests critically on the assumption that the smc lens population falls off relatively rapidly along the line of sight .",
    "( we adopted an @xmath238 power law . )",
    "this is because equation ( [ eqn : gsmc ] ) scales @xmath316 .",
    "if the smc had a halo lens population with a much shallower falloff than we have assumed , this term could dominate the integral in equation ( [ eqn : likesmc ] ) even if the overall normalization of the halo were relatively low .",
    "hence , magellanic cloud halo lensing could provide an alternate explanation both for this smc event and the events seen by macho toward the lmc @xcite . as mentioned above , _ sim _ could easily distinguish between this conjecture and the halo - lens hypothesis .",
    "finally , we remark that analysis of this event was extraordinarily difficult because it was a `` weak '' ( i.e. , non - caustic - crossing ) binary .",
    "if it had been either a single - mass lens or a caustic - crossing binary , it would have been much easier to analyze and the inferences regarding its location ( in the halo or the smc ) would have been much more transparent .",
    "we therefore look forward to applying this same technique to more typical events .",
