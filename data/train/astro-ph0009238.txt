    "it has been generally accepted that a supernova s explosion energy carried by its ejecta to form a supernova remnant ( snr ) is roughly 10@xmath4 ergs ( jones et al .",
    "1998 ) . upon analyzing the x - ray emission from snrs in the giant spiral galaxy m101 , wang ( 1999 ) discovered two snrs that appeared to require explosion energies one to two orders of magnitude higher .",
    "one of these snrs , ngc5471b , is inside the giant  region ngc5471 ( skillman 1985 ; chu & kennicutt 1986 ) .",
    "the other snr , mf83 ( notation from matonick & fesen 1997 ) , also appears to be associated with a star formation region ( chu , chen , & lai 2000 ) .",
    "similarly high energies have been frequently found in gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) .",
    "as some grbs have afterglows several hundred times more luminous than the brightest supernovae , they have been dubbed  hypernovae . \" some grbs have been observed to be near star - forming regions ( paczyski 1998 ) . because of the similarities in the energy requirement and the interstellar / stellar environment , wang ( 1999 ) called the two super - energetic snrs in m101  hypernova remnants , \" although the association of hypernova remnants to the grbs has been recently questioned by paczyski ( 2000 ) .",
    "regardless of the grb connection , snrs with such large explosion energies are unusual and therefore warrant further investigation . to study the physical nature of the two hypernova remnants in m101 ,",
    "we have obtained deep images with ground - based telescopes , high - resolution images with the _ hubble space telescope _ , and high - dispersion spectra with an echelle spectrograph . in this paper ( paper i )",
    ", we report on the hypernova remnant mf83 .",
    "the hypernova remnant ngc5471b will be presented in paper ii .",
    "the suggestion that mf83 is super - energetic is based mainly on its high x - ray luminosity ( wang 1999 ) .",
    "however , none of the existing x - ray observations have resolved mf83 .",
    "it is possible that point sources contribute significantly to mf83 s x - ray emission , since massive x - ray binaries are frequently found in star formation regions .",
    "only optical observations can resolve mf83 ; therefore , we have used our new observations to examine the physical structure of mf83 and to seek independent evidence for a powerful explosion . at optical wavelengths , mf83 is unusually large , with a diameter approaching @xmath1270 pc ( matonick & fesen 1997 ) , if we adopt a distance of 7.2 mpc for m101 ( stetson et al .",
    "no known snrs in the local group are so large .",
    "it is therefore important to measure the expansion velocity of mf83 in order to assess the validity of its identification as a snr .    in this paper",

    "the three concentrations of stellar emission along the southern rim of the shell ( sources b  d in figure 3e ) are not fully resolved in the wfpc2 @xmath20 image , but they ( sources 4 , 5 , and 13 ) each show irregular , extended spatial structure indicating the existence of multiple stars . within the compact  region at the northwest periphery of the shell , stars are also detected , but they are not as highly concentrated or as bright as the stars within the shell and along the south rim of the shell .",

    "if @xmath43 = 0.5 , these figures will be 0.3 h @xmath45 , 7@xmath210@xmath60 m@xmath47 , and 5.2@xmath210@xmath3 ergs , respectively .",
    "the snr mf83 in m101 is intriguing because it has been suggested to be a hypernova remnant and it may need an explosion energy comparable to those associated with grbs ( wang 1999 ) .",
    "our new observations allow us to examine critically the physical nature of mf83",
    ". we will first compare mf83 to known , common astronomical objects and assess the likelihood that mf83 has a similar nature .",
    "we will then consider the possibility of the existence of an energetic snr and evaluate its energetics .",
    "mf83 consists of a @xmath1270 pc ionized gas shell , three  regions along the south rim and another  region outside the northwest rim of the shell .",
    "this arrangement is commonly seen in star formation regions .",
    "these  regions individually have an h@xmath8  luminosity of @xmath12@xmath210@xmath61 ergs  s@xmath7 .",
    "this h@xmath8  luminosity requires an ionizing flux of @xmath12@xmath210@xmath62 ionizing photons s@xmath7 , which can be easily supplied by an o6 star or several later - type o stars .",
    "the presence of late - type o stars , or a lack of early - type o stars , is also supported by the low [ oiii]/h@xmath8  ratios of the  regions .",
    "the stellar continuum sources detected in the wfpc2 @xmath20 images have absolute visual magnitudes @xmath34 in the range of @xmath63 to @xmath64 mag ( table  2 ) . while the faintest sources might be single early - type supergiants , the brighter sources and especially the sources showing asymmetric or extended images are composites , e.g. , sources 4 , 5 , 12 , and 13 in table  2 and figure 4 .",
    "the composite sources embedded in   regions ( sources 4 , 5 , and 13 ) and the composite source at the shell center ( source 12 ) are most likely ob associations .    the  regions and ob associations in mf83 are only about twice as powerful as the orion nebula , and are comparable to the less impressive ob/  regions in the lmc .",
    "mf83 is a star formation region , but by no means a starburst region .",
    "the existence of a snr in mf83 is suggested by the high [ sii]/h@xmath8   ratio , 0.76 ( matonick & fesen 1997 ) , and bright x - ray emission , 1.2@xmath210@xmath56 ergs s@xmath7 ( wang 1999 ) .",
    "these two properties , unfortunately , can not unambiguously ensure the existence of a snr for the following reasons .",
    "first , the [ sii]/h@xmath8  ratio is high for both low - velocity shocks ( shock velocity @xmath4150 ) and high - velocity shocks ( shock velocity @xmath65100 ) ( shull & mckee 1979 ) .",
    "while snrs with large shock velocities show high [ sii]/h@xmath8  ratios , superbubbles with expansion velocities approaching 50  also show high [ sii]/h@xmath8  ratios , for example , the superbubbles n185 and n186e in the lmc have [ sii]/h@xmath8  ratios of 0.64 and @xmath11 , respectively ( lasker 1977 ) .",
    "second , the x - ray source in mf83 is not resolved by the @xmath66 hri or pspc . moreover",
    ", the pspc spectral hardness ratio of mf83 suggests the existence of a hard component , which is frequently associated with x - ray binaries , and the x - ray luminosity of mf83 is within the range of luminosities seen in x - ray binaries in m101 ( wang et al .",
    "therefore , until the x - ray source is shown to be spatially extended or the radio spectral index is observed to be nonthermal , the existence of a snr in mf83 is not confirmed .",
    "the large shell in mf83 was initially identified as the snr ( matonick & fesen 1997 ) . as we have illustrated in  4.1 ,",
    "this large shell is centered on groups of stars that are likely to be ob associations .",
    "the large shell size and the central stellar content suggest that this shell is a superbubble .",
    "it is then interesting to compare the physical properties of this large shell in mf83 to those of known superbubbles in the lmc , which have been extensively studied .",
    "most lmc superbubbles with sizes greater than 100 pc have expansion velocities well below 50 ( georgelin et al .  1983 ; rosado 1986 ) , with n185 being the only exception ( diameter @xmath1 105 pc , expansion velocity = 70@xmath3210 , rosado et al .  1982 ) .",
    "the 50  expansion velocity and 270-pc diameter of mf83 thus make it unusual : it is unusually large for its expansion velocity , or it expands unusually fast for its size .",
    "the expansion velocity of the mf83 shell implies a shock velocity of @xmath167 .",
    "the post - shock region should have a high [ oiii]/h@xmath8   ratio , but not larger than 1.0 ( shull & mckee 1979 ; hartigan , raymond , & hartmann 1987 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the observed high [ oiii]/h@xmath8ratio in the shell , @xmath10.7 .",
    "this shock velocity may also be responsible for the high [ sii]/h@xmath8  ratio observed in the mf83 shell , but is not high enough to produce x - ray emission in the post - shock region .",
    "the high [ sii]/h@xmath8  ratio and bright x - ray emission must not originate from the same shocks .",
    "if the x - ray emission from mf83 is indeed diffuse and originates in the shell interior , the mf83 shell would be similar to the x - ray - bright superbubbles in the lmc , which have been suggested to be powered by interior snrs near the shell walls ( chu & mac low 1990 ; wang & helfand 1991 ) .",
    "many x - ray - bright superbubbles in the lmc are known to expand faster than expected and have high [ sii]/h@xmath8  ratio ( oey 1996 ) .",
    "it is possible that the large shell in mf83 is an x - ray - bright superbubble .    as an x - ray - bright superbubble ,",
    "the mf83 shell is unusually large for its expansion velocity and is exceptionally luminous in x - rays .",
    "compared to the x - ray - brightest superbubble in the lmc , n44 ( chu et al .",
    "1993 ) , the mf83 superbubble is @xmath1500 times more luminous .",
    "the internal thermal energy implied by the x - ray emission is a few @xmath210@xmath3 ergs .",
    "it is conceivable that the high thermal pressure , resultant from this large thermal energy , drives the fast expansion of the superbubble .",
    "however , this amount of thermal energy is more than an order of magnitude higher than the canonical explosion energy of a supernova .",
    "if the large shell in mf83 is an x - ray - bright superbubble , it requires either a  hypernova \" or 10100 normal supernovae within the past @xmath1 1@xmath210@xmath50 years , the cooling time scale for a hot gas with a temperature of 3@xmath210@xmath50 k and density of 0.5 h @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility that the large shell of mf83 is formed by one single energetic explosion .",
    "our analyses in  3.2 and  3.3 show a kinetic energy of a few @xmath210@xmath4 ergs in the ionized gas shell , and an internal thermal energy of a few @xmath210@xmath3 ergs in the shell interior .",
    "a similar disparity between the ionized shell kinetic energy and internal thermal energy has been seen in the x - ray - bright superbubble n44 , but it is found that the ionized shell of n44 is enveloped by a co - expanding , more massive , neutral  shell ( kim et al .",
    "it is possible that the mf83 shell also has a neutral shell carrying more mass and kinetic energy than the ionized shell .",
    "the kinetic energy in the ionized gas shell is thus a lower limit on the shell kinetic energy , and can not be used to determine the explosion energy .",
    "if the mf83 shell is formed by one single explosion , the explosion energy must be greater than the observed internal thermal energy , and may approach @xmath67 ergs , which is about two orders of magnitude higher than the canonical explosion energy for a normal supernova ( jones et al .",
    "this large energy requirement would qualify mf83 as a ",
    "hypernova remnant .",
    "\" however , to prove that mf83 is indeed a hypernova remnant , it is necessary to demonstrate convincingly that a single explosion formed the mf83 shell .",
    "the existence of ob associations within mf83 provides circumstantial evidence that multiple explosions produced the shell , but this neither demonstrates or rules out that a dominant powerful explosion occurred .",
    "the snr candidate mf83 in m101 has been suggested to be a hypernova remnant that requires an explosion energy about two orders of magnitude higher than those of normal supernovae , based mainly on the high x - ray luminosity of mf83 and the assumption that all x - ray emission originates from shock - heated gas in the remnant .",
    "we have analyzed high - quality ground - based and @xmath0 images of mf83 , and found that mf83 is a star formation region .",
    "the h@xmath8  images show that mf83 consists of four  regions and a large ionized shell .",
    "the stellar continuum images show groups of stars in the  regions and within the shell ; these groups of stars are most likely ob associations .",
    "the stellar content and physical properties of the large shell in mf83 suggest that it is a superbubble",
    ". if the x - ray emission is indeed diffuse , this shell will be an x - ray - bright superbubble whose interior has been heated by recent supernovae . the thermal energy derived from the x - ray data",
    "is a few @xmath210@xmath3 ergs , which requires either a  hypernova \" or 10100 normal supernovae in the past 10@xmath50 years .",
    "if it can be proved that the shell of mf83 is produced by one single explosion , then a  hypernova \" may be in order .",
    "future x - ray observations with high angular resolution is needed to resolve the x - ray source in mf83 . only after excluding point sources in mf83",
    "can we determine the true amount of diffuse x - ray emission , re - evaluate the energy budgets , and assess the ",
    "hypernova remnant \" nature of mf83 .",
