    "attempts to give a classical model of charged particles , in particular , electrons , have been going on since the time of lorentz @xcite . the model proposed by lorentz in which electrons have only ` electromagnetic mass ' and no ` true ' or ` mechanical mass ' is commonly known as the electromagnetic mass model .",
    "he assumed electron to be an extended object consisting of pure charge and no matter .",
    "this model was proved to be unstable but later on with the arrival of special relativity , the model was subsequently improved .",
    "the model was motivated from the hypothesis that gravitational mass and other physical quantities emerge from the electromagnetic field alone . in the past",
    ", this model has been investigated in the classical , quantum and relativistic regimes , and we are here re - analyzing the same model in the last scheme .",
    "the earliest developments were made by lorentz @xcite by describing the properties of particles by their interaction with the ether .",
    "further , thomson @xcite found that the kinetic energy of the charged sphere increases by its motion through a medium of finite specific inductive capacity , and he concluded that this increase in kinetic energy results in the increase of mass of the charged sphere , a phenomenon later on termed as the ` electromagnetic mass ' .",
    "later on , the improvement was made by mie @xcite through constructing a model of electrons having their origin from the electromagnetic fields alone .",
    "the drawbacks of mie s model were later removed by the einstein s general theory of relativity , with the inclusion of gravitational mass in the model to stabilize the electron @xcite ( see also @xcite for the history of the electromagnetic mass model ) .",
    "tiwari and co - workers @xcite gave an extensive model of electron in the context of general relativity .",
    "they assumed electron as charged sphere of perfect fluid and obtained the pressure inside the charged sphere negative .",
    "it vanishes at @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the radius of the sphere .",
    "this result was later explained by gron @xcite in the context of vacuum polarization .",
    "et al _ showed that in their model the gravitational mass , pressure and mass density of electron vanishes when charge is zero @xcite . in a pioneering work , bonnor and",
    "cooperstock @xcite discussed the model of electron as a static charged sphere that obeys einstein - maxwell theory of relativity and found that it must contain some negative rest mass density .",
    "moreover , they found that the electron has negative active gravitational mass within the sphere of radius @xmath2 cm .",
    "herrera and varela @xcite proposed an electromagnetic mass model satisfying the pure charge condition , @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 being the pressure and mass density respectively .",
    "they obtained energy density to be negative for the radius @xmath6 cm which is experimentally verified upper limit of the radius of electron .",
    "some authors have also discussed the electromagnetic mass models in different context @xcite .",
    "recently a new model has been proposed a quadratic eos to describe homogeneous and inhomogeneous cosmological models @xcite .",
    "this quadratic eos , @xmath7 , where @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are parameters , is nothing but the taylor expansion of arbitrary barotropic eos , @xmath11 . according to @xcite ,",
    "the quadratic eos may describe dark energy or unified dark matter . in the string theory ,",
    "the gravity is a truly higher dimensional interaction , which becomes effectively 4d at low enough energies . in brane world models , inspired by string theory ,",
    "the physical fields in our four dimensional universe are confined to the three brane , while gravity can access the extra dimension . in brane world scenario , the gravity on the brane can be described by the modified 4-dimensional einstein s equations which contain ( i ) @xmath12 , which is quadratic in the stress energy tensor of matter confined on the brane ( ii ) the trace less tensor @xmath13 , originating from the 5d weyl tensor .",
    "although , one neglects the 5d weyl tensor contributions ( under reasonable assumption ) in these equations , in spite of that the quadratic term of energy density appears in the 4-dimensional effective energy momentum tensor and should play a significant role of different characteristics of the models .",
    "so , it is not unnatural to choose quadratic form of the eos .",
    "and this quadratic form of the eos is obviously the specific form of the arbitrary barotropic eos , @xmath11 .    to search the matter source that characterized the electromagnetic mass remains an elusive goal for theoretical physicists .",
    "as discussed earlier , motivated by the result in the brane world models , we try to explore the possibility that the electromagnetic mass be supported by quadratic eos .",
    "we have found some specific solutions of einstein - maxwell equations describing electromagnetic mass for a matter source that is characterized by quadratic eos . as we are interested to assume the eos is quadratic in the energy density , we take the following form of eos @xcite , @xmath14 where , @xmath15 are parameters .",
    "at first we take these parameters as arbitrary , but restrictions on these parameters may be specified later .    the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 , we provide the einstein - maxwell field equations combined with the electromagnetic tensor field and an isotropic fluid .",
    "the solutions with some particular cases are given in section 3 .",
    "the static spherically symmetric space - time is given by the line - element ( in geometrized units with @xmath16 ) @xmath17 where the arbitrary functions @xmath18 and @xmath19 depend on the radial coordinate @xmath20 only .",
    "as the electromagnetic mass of the electron consists of its density and charge , the corresponding stress - energy tensor should contain both parts accordingly , hence we take @xmath21 for the metric ( 1 ) , the einstein@xmath22maxwell field equations are @xcite @xmath23 + \\frac{1}{r^{2}}=8\\pi\\rho+e^{2},\\ ] ] @xmath24 -\\frac { 1}{r^{2}}=8\\pi p - e^{2},\\ ] ] @xmath25   = 8\\pi p + e^{2}.\\ ] ] here @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 represent the fluid pressure , energy density and electric field , respectively , for a charged fluid sphere . in our model",
    ", we use the quadratic equation of state @xmath29 ^ 2.\\ ] ] the electric field is expressed as @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the charge density on the sphere .",
    "( 9 ) gives the following form for the electric field @xmath32 with @xmath33 is the total charge of the sphere under consideration . also , the hydrodynamical equilibrium condition ( @xmath34 ) is given by @xmath35 the above expression represents the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equation for a charged sphere . in the next section",
    ", we are going to solve the equations ( 5)@xmath22(10 ) , to get the metric coefficients .",
    "these solutions describe different type of charged fluid spheres for given _ effective _ densities . for",
    "a sphere of radius @xmath36 , the pressure must vanish at @xmath36 and consequently the pressure gradient must be decreasing function of @xmath20 .",
    "since @xmath37 ( due to the fact @xmath38 ) , it yields that density to vanish at the surface too . to avoid this inconsistency ,",
    "it is necessary that the sphere must be charged .",
    "one can note that the term @xmath39 occurring inside the integral sign in equation ( 10 ) , is equivalent to the volume charge density . we will discuss two models assuming the volume charge density being polynomial function of @xmath20 .",
    "hence we use the condition @xmath40 where @xmath41 is arbitrary constant and the constant @xmath42 is the charge density at @xmath43 , the center of the charged matter @xcite .      in this specialization , we assume the effective radial pressure is constant as @xmath44 where @xmath8 is an arbitrary constant . here",
    ", we assume effective radial pressure is minimum at the center , @xmath45 and equal to constant , say @xmath8 . equation ( 9 ) together with ( 12 ) yields @xmath46 while eqs .",

    "we have provided two new toy electromagnetic mass models which suggest that mass of electron has the ultimate origin from the electromagnetic field alone . for this , we have considered a static spherically symmetric charged perfect fluid with the quadratic eos @xmath76 . in the first model , the total effective pressure is taken to be a combination of the barotropic pressure and the one generated due to the electric field . while in the second model , the effective energy density is taken to be sum of barotropic energy density and due to the electric field .",
    "the parameter in the eos , namely @xmath9 is related to sound speed for the fluid as follows : the squared of sound velocity , @xmath77 , is always positive irrespective of matter density . in literature ,",
    "more generally employed eos parameter @xmath78 is : @xmath79 .",
    "hence , @xmath9 is related to sound speed and eos parameter as @xmath80 .    according to previous models @xcite ,",
    "an electron ( experimentally obtained radius @xmath81 cm , the inertial mass @xmath82 cm , charge @xmath83 cm in relativistic units ) is modeled as a charge fluid sphere obeying einstein - maxwell theory .",
    "so , the interior metric should be matched with the exterior reissner - nordstrm metric .",
    "if @xmath84 be the effective gravitational mass within the fluid sphere , then matching at the junction interface implies @xmath85 . putting the above values of inertial mass , charge and radius of the electron ,",
    "one gets the value of the effective gravitational mass within the fluid sphere is @xmath86 cm .    since",
    ", we have studied two models assuming the volume charge density being polynomial function of @xmath20 , so for both the models the electric field and total charge of the sphere under consideration are the same .",
    "if we assume the charge density @xmath87 at @xmath88 , the center of the charged matter is @xmath89 , then charge of the fluid is nearly equal to @xmath90 cm in relativistic units ( see the fig 1 ) which is equivalent to the charge of electron . in a similar way ,",
    "if one assumes the suitable values of the parameters , then all physical parameters like , pressure , density and effective gravitational mass of the charged fluid that represents the electron can be obtained ( see figs . 3 , 4 and 5 ) .    in model 1 , one can note that for the following values of the parameters : @xmath91 , @xmath52 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 , the term @xmath94 is the dominating term in equation ( 20 ) . in this case",
    "the effective gravitational mass @xmath95 ( see the figure 5 ) .",
    "note that this result of negative mass is consistent with that of [ 12 ] , if the size of electron is taken to be less then @xmath6 cm .",
    "this negative mass and gravitational repulsion is a signature of the strain of the vacuum due to vacuum polarization [ 8 ] . for model 2 , if one chooses the values of the parameters @xmath96 and @xmath52 , then the effective gravitational mass @xmath97 ( see the figure 8) . in figs .",
    "( 4 ) and ( 7 ) , we see that the energy density @xmath5 has decreasing behavior against the radial parameter and it takes negative values .",
    "this behavior arises since @xmath98 for @xmath99 ( vacuum fluid ) .",
    "thus figures ( 3 ) and ( 6 ) manifest the rising behavior of pressure .    in the present work , we have considered charged fluid of radius @xmath100 ( i.e. electron ) obeying quadratic equation of state .",
    "we hope other people would be motivated by our approach and in future will try to extrapolate the present investigation to the astrophysical bodies , specially quark or strange stars .",
