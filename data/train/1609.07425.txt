    "research on oxide heterostructures has been very fruitful during the last decade , in particular due to the special electronic properties of interface layers between oxides slabs of disparate stoichiometry .",
    "these properties are determined by electronic reconstruction , that is , by the formation of interface states which differ significantly from the electronic states of the adjacent bulk materials . in the paradigmatic laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 oxide heterostructure ,",
    "@xcite two band insulators share a metallic interface when at least four layers of laalo@xmath0 ( lao ) with lao termination towards the tio@xmath1 interface layer are deposited on srtio@xmath0 ( sto ) .",
    "@xcite however , electronic reconstruction not only allows for a conducting state but , moreover , interface confined superconducting ,  @xcite magnetic ,  @xcite and negative compressibility states  @xcite have been identified .",
    "even topologically protected superconducting phases have been predicted to form at these heterostructures .",
    "@xcite    beyond the fascinating fundamental physical problems , related to the build - up and the coexistence or competition of these interface states , the oxide heterostructures are also in the focus of research with regard to their functionality , that is , their potential to use them as electronic devices .",
    "@xcite for example , circuits with all - oxide field - effect transistors were fabricated from lao / sto heterostructures .",
    "@xcite the wider use of such oxide devices requires to characterize the electronic transport under the effect of external parameters such as temperature , magnetic field , pressure and bias .",
    "however , the electronic transport at the interface of lao / sto is complex : it is confined to few layers of sto with conduction electrons from all three ti @xmath2 states , so a multi - band quasi two - dimensional ( 2d ) behavior is to be explored .",
    "moreover , spin - orbit coupling ( soc ) seems to play an important role in these systems , affecting the electron propagation in the proximity to the disordered interface .",
    "@xcite disorder may be generated by impurities , such as oxygen vacancies , or by intermixing and structural defects",
    ". eventually , also electron interaction effects are of relevance .",
    "@xcite a metal - insulator transition ( mit ) depending on charge carrier density has been observed at low densities but its origin has not been clarified .",
    "@xcite    in this intricate context , fundamental issues are not yet adequately understood .",
    "several of them are related to transport in disordered electronic systems : the strong soc , which can be tuned via a gate voltage ,  @xcite is assumed to lead to weak anderson anti - localization ( wal ) , but until now there has been no clear picture of the specific associated mechanism : this wal may originate either from elastic potential scattering in combination with rashba soc for the propagating electrons or from impurities with spin - orbit coupling . while this quantum interference phenomenon is in its very nature anti - localizing , renormalization group arguments within a one - parameter scaling theory predict an anderson metal - insulator transition in 2d , belonging to the symplectic universality class .",
    "@xcite we therefore assess that wal , specifically at lao / sto interfaces , may be viewed as a precursor of this transition , which has never been observed experimentally up to now .",
    "however , the observed magnetoconductance may as well be attributed to electron - electron - interaction ( eei ) ,  @xcite and we readdress this controversy concerning its origin .",
    "it turns out that the multi - band character of the interface plays a key role in resolving the issue .",
    "we investigate magnetoresistance ( mr ) measurements at the lao / sto interface under hydrostatic pressure and find that the wal becomes visible only for sufficient pressure in our samples , which feature a relatively high carrier density @xmath36@xmath410@xmath5@xmath6 .",
    "we show that a careful analysis of the contribution of multiple charge carriers and their interplay with wal may resolve previous puzzles of the low temperature behaviour . up to now",
    ", the overlying multi - band nature of the electronic interface state made it challenging to favor a certain soc scenario for the wal.@xcite we introduce a fitting procedure that allows for the evaluation of the magnetotransport data over the complete measured magnetic field range .",
    "this fitting procedure treats the multiple charge carrier hall effect and the wal on the same footing .",
    "a main result from this analysis is the clear evidence that wal arises due to cubic spin - orbit splitting of interface electronic bands .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ sec : wal ] , we review the model for the itinerant @xmath2 bands of lao / sto and the formulation of wal theory , depending on the microscopic structure of the spin - orbit coupling . in section  [ sec : exp ] , we present the treatment of the multi - band hall effect when a significant wal is present and provide the experimental evidence for the cubic spin - orbit splitting in our samples .",
    "this links the wal to the corresponding ti @xmath7/@xmath8 bands . in section  [ sec : disc ] we discuss the role of interaction effects .",
    "finally , we consider the possibility to observe a symplectic mit in lao / sto heterostructures .",
    "the electron liquid at the lao / sto interface is strongly confined to a few lattice constants in the transverse direction .",
    "@xcite as a two - dimensional system it can not support a simple metallic state : assuming that electron interactions are irrelevant , any disorder will lead to localization of the electronic system , at least for low temperatures.@xcite however , the strong spin - orbit coupling present in this system opens the possibility of anti - localization being visible in the magnetotransport.@xcite both localization and anti - localization are interference effects of the electron wave function and can be detected via sheet resistance measurements in transverse magnetic fields .",
    "the field - dependence of the magnetoresistance is controlled by the type of spin - orbit coupling .      to analyze the experimental mr data , we base the evaluation on the ti @xmath9 @xmath2 electronic structure at the interface  @xcite and its six - band extension introduced in refs .   for the system with soc .",
    "the corresponding tight - binding hamiltonian contains four parts , @xmath10 which we will briefly review in the following .",

    "near the @xmath30-point , one finds a linear spin splitting with respect to @xmath31 for the lower and higher band pair , but a cubic spin splitting , reminiscent of dresselhaus soc , in the middle band pair .",
    "@xcite note that this picture breaks down when the filling is close to the avoided band crossings .",
    "the rashba - like effect is not directly affected by an external electric ( gate ) field , but rather tuned via the concomitant change of the band filling .",

    "a spin - orbit coupling term in the kinetic energy , combined with elastic scattering processes , is able to explain weak anti - localization signatures of transport measurements in two - dimensional systems.@xcite the theory in its final form was established by iordanskii , lyanda - geller and pikus ( ilp ) and treats 2d hamiltonians of the type @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 represents a precession vector that results from the broken inversion symmetry .",

    "]    the localized band may dominate the transport for higher temperatures , and the total resistance resembles that of an insulator .",
    "however , for low temperatures the scaling in the anti - localized band will finally lead to a vanishing sheet resistance .    using the multi - band analysis presented in the previous sections , the metallic band featuring the strong soc may be resolved .",
    "its temperature dependence is then given by  , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling](b ) .",
    "we believe that the temperature range , which allows for a clear vision of the mit , was not reached in the current experiments . in two dimensions",
    ", the localization length can be quite large , even larger than the sample size .",
    "therefore , the scaling should be visible only for very low temperatures , similar to the interaction - driven transition at low densities .",
    "it is also quite probable that the transition will only be revealed under high pressure , rendering future experiments in this direction a challenging task .",
    "the evaluation of magnetotransport measurements presents a particular challenge for the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface electronic systems .",
    "these two - dimensional electron fluids are multi - band systems with strong spin - orbit coupling and quantum interference effects which may result from anderson localization or electron - electron interaction .",
    "here we investigated interfaces with sufficiently large carrier filling so that a multi - band description is appropriate .",
    "this becomes evident from the quadratic terms in the magnetoresistance for intermediate magnetic fields as well as from the cubic term in the hall resistance .",
    "it is then hydrostatic pressure that enhances the visibility of quantum corrections to the magnetotransport , which we conjecture to originate in weak anti - localization .",
    "this interpretation is in accordance with the analysis of ambient pressure experiments by caviglia _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite but in discrepancy to the interpretation of fuchs _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on their pressure dependent data .    for the interface of laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 ,",
    "our work is the first to separate the multi - band behavior from the corrections to magnetotransport using an unbiased self - consistent evaluation procedure . assuming the corrections to reflect anti - localization",
    ", this procedure allows us to distinguish clearly different spin - orbit coupling scenarios .",
    "as the interface is subject to a structural inversion - symmetry breaking and strong spin - orbit scatterers are absent , we conclude that the ilp model is the appropriate theoretical framework to analyze the weak anti - localization corrections .",
    "we identify a spin - orbit coupling with cubic momentum - dependent spin splitting as the coupling mechanism . correspondingly , the measured spin - orbit coupling is not rashba - like but rather `` dresselhaus - like '' .",
    "as the ti @xmath7/@xmath8 bands display such a cubic spin splitting in a well - established six - band evaluation ,  @xcite we relate the weak anti - localization to the corresponding pair of bands in the electronic structure ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bands ] ) . a similar correspondence was put forward for srtio@xmath0 surface states .",
    "@xcite    we find an excellent fit over the full measured magnetic field range .",
    "however , the nature of the observed second ( hole ) band remains open .",
    "also it is not clear from the outset , why hydrostatic pressure enhances the weak anti - localization corrections relative to the multi - band signal .",
    "we know from previous work that the carrier density in the @xmath7/@xmath8 bands increases with pressure  @xcite and that an _ ab initio _",
    "evaluation is consistent with this observation .",
    "@xcite yet an explanation of the pressure dependence of the weak anti - localization is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "we have further shown that electron - electron interactions , invoked by fuchs _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite to explain the logarthmic decrease of the sheet resistance with decresing temperature below 10k , do not easily account for our data .",
    "moreover , the rise of the total resistance with decreasing temperature , ruling out weak anti - localization in a single band model , can be explained within our multi - band scenario and therefore does not contradict weak anti - localization as cause for the corrections . however , further measurements at much lower temperatures are needed to confirm the prediction of metallic @xmath7/@xmath8 bands .",
    "very low temperatures are also mandatory to observe the scaling behavior [ fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling](b ) ] of the conductance associated to the electron band , which should undergo a two - dimensional metal - insulator transition as a function of the density , even without appreciable electron - electron interaction .",
    "this exotic type of anderson transition  never observed before  is hidden in the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 system due to the presence of the second band , which possesses weak spin - orbit coupling and must therefore localize for low temperatures .",
    "only the disentangling of both bands and their respective transport characteristics using the analysis presented in the present work may reveal the symplectic anderson transition of the laalo@xmath0/srtio@xmath0 interface , adding another unexpected facet to this well - studied oxide heterostructure .",
