    "supernova ( sn ) 1988z was independently discovered in mcg + 03 - 28 - 022 ( zw 095 - 049 ) near @xmath10 by both g.  candeo on 1988 december 12 ( cappellaro , turatto , & candeo 1988 ) and c.  pollas on 1988 december 14 ( pollas 1988 ) .",
    "the sn was classified as a type ii , based on the detection of hydrogen emission lines in the optical spectra by cowley & hartwich ( heathcote et al .",
    "1988 ) , which also indicated that the sn was quite distant , with redshift @xmath11 .",
    "filippenko ( 1989 ) confirmed the type ii identification , with possible resemblance to sn 1987f .",
    "the spectra revealed at early times that sn 1988z was peculiar , with a remarkably blue color , a lack of absorption lines and p - cygni profiles , very narrow ( @xmath12100 km s@xmath4 fwhm ) [ o iii ] circumstellar emission lines , and a steadily growing , relatively narrow ( @xmath132000 km s@xmath4 fwhm ) component to the h i and he i lines ( stathakis & sadler 1991 ; filippenko 1991a , b ) .",
    "stathakis & sadler ( 1991 ) , and turatto et al .",
    "( 1993 ) for later times , analyzed in detail the spectroscopic and photometric observations of sn 1988z .",
    "schlegel ( 1990 ) proposed that sn 1988z , along with other similar sne , constituted a new class of sne , the type ii-``narrow , '' or sne iin .",
    "the properties of the optical spectra and light curves indicated strong sn shock - circumstellar shell interaction ( filippenko 1991a , b ; turatto et al .  1993 ) which , together with its resemblance optically to sn 1986j ( filippenko 1991a , b ; see also rupen et al .  1987 , leibundgut et al .",
    "1991 ) , strongly suggested that sn 1988z should be a very luminous radio emitter , as sn 1986j is a strong radio source ( see weiler , panagia , & sramek 1990 ) .",
    "sramek et al .",
    "( 1990 ) reported the radio detection at 6 cm wavelength of sn 1988z with the very large array ( vla ) on 1989 december 21 .",
    "the supernova is located at ra(j2000 ) = @xmath14 , dec(j2000 ) = @xmath15 , with an uncertainty of @xmath16 02 in each coordinate , which is coincident , to within the uncertainties , with its optical position ( kirshner , leibundgut , & smith 1989 ) .",
    "this initial announcement of the detection of radio emission was followed by a more thorough study and analysis of the first three years of multifrequency radio observations by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "they compared sn 1988z in detail with sn 1986j and concluded that the two sne are very similar in their radio properties .",
    "they suggested that the progenitor to sn 1988z was a massive [ @xmath17 star which underwent a high mass - loss phase ( @xmath18 yr@xmath4 ) before explosion ( see also stathakis & sadler 1991 ) .",
    "luminous radio emission has also been an indicator of x - ray emission from sne , with synchrotron radio emission being produced as the forward sn shock interacts with the csm and x - rays being emitted from the corresponding reverse shock region interacting with the sn ejecta ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "for instance , sn 1986j was detected as a luminous x - ray source by bregman & pildis ( 1992 ) and houck et al .",
    "fabian & terlevich ( 1996 ) reported the detection of x - rays from sn 1988z with rosat .",
    "sn 1988z is a very luminous x - ray emitter with a bolometric x - ray luminosity of @xmath19 .",
    "chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) offered two models to explain the unusual characteristics of sn 1988z : 1 ) shock interaction with a two component wind consisting of a tenuous , homogeneous medium with embedded higher density clumps , or 2 ) shock interaction with a similar tenuous , homogeneous medium and a higher - density , equatorial , wind - established , disk - like component , favoring the former over the latter .",
    "however , they unexpectedly conclude that the sn ejecta is of low mass ( @xmath20 ) , and that sn 1988z may have originated from a relatively low - mass star of @xmath2110 @xmath22 , in sharp contrast to the high - mass progenitor suggested by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) and stathakis & sadler ( 1991 ) .",
    "aretxaga et al .  ( 1999 ) collect the observations from x - ray to radio and attempt to estimate the integrated electromagnetic energy radiated by sn 1988z in the first 8.5 years after discovery .",
    "they obtain a value of @xmath23 erg , perhaps as high as @xmath24 erg , which they consider is sufficiently high to suggest that sn 1988z could be classified as a `` hypernova , '' approaching the 2@xmath25 ergs estimated to have been released in sn 1998bw , the possible counterpart of grb 980425 ( iwamoto et al .",
    "1998 ) , and perhaps indicative of the collapse of the stellar progenitor core into a black hole .",
    "( it is interesting to note here that two sne iin , 1997cy and 1999e , may also have been associated with @xmath26-ray bursts ; see pastorello et al .",
    "2002 and references therein ) .",
    "aretxaga et al .",
    "( 1999 ) suggest an ejecta mass of @xmath27 , and , therefore , a very high - mass progenitor .",
    "obviously , sn 1988z is an extremely interesting and , in many ways , unusual object .",
    "fortunately , due to its intrinsic brightness it has been relatively well - studied in many wavelength bands . here",
    "we report radio observations of sn 1988z at multiple wavelengths , including new observations which add another six years of monitoring , more than doubling the coverage reported by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "we further interpret its radio emission using a clumpy wind model .",
    "we conclude that sn 1988z , like sne 1986j and , possibly , other sne iin , as well as the unusual sn 1998bw , arise from the explosions of very massive stars surrounded by highly filamentary csm .",
    "new radio observations of sn 1988z have been made with the vla at 20 cm ( 1.425 ghz ) , 6 cm ( 4.860 ghz ) , 3.6 cm ( 8.440 ghz ) and 2.0 cm ( 14.940 ghz ) from 1993 may 4 through 2001 january 25 and are presented in table 1 and figure 1 . the previously published results from van dyk et al .  ( 1993a ) , along with a few additional and reanalyzed flux density values , are also included in table 1 and figure 1 for ease of reference .",
    "note that the estimated explosion date of 1988 january 23 obtained by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) from their model fit was very poorly constrained by their fitting procedure . here",
    ", we adopt the explosion date of 1988 december 1 estimated from optical data ( stathakis & sadler 1991 ) .",
    "we have correspondingly modified the sn age at each of the epochs in table 1 and figure 1 relative to those reported in van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "this change in assumed explosion date , although large , is not critical for the model fitting and does not significantly affect the quality of the fit or the conclusions made by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "the techniques of observation , editing , calibration , and error estimation are described in previous publications on the radio emission from sne ( see , e.g. , weiler et al .  1986 , 1990 , 1991 ) .",
    "the `` primary '' calibrator was 3c  286 , which is assumed to be constant in time with flux densities of 14.45 , 7.42 , 5.20 , and 3.45 jy at 20 , 6 , 3.6 , and 2 cm , respectively .",
    "the `` secondary '' calibrators were j1051 + 213 , used through 1991 january 17 , and j1125 + 261 , for all epochs after that , with defined positions of ra(j2000 ) = @xmath28 , dec(j2000 ) = + @xmath29 and ra(j2000 ) = @xmath30 , dec(j2000 ) = + @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "after flux density calibration by 3c  286 , they served as the actual gain and phase calibrators for sn 1988z .",
    "as expected for secondary calibrators , the flux densities of j1051 + 213 and j1125 + 261 have been varying over the years , as can be seen in table 2 and figure 2 .",
    "the flux density measurement errors for sn 1988z are a combination of the rms map error , which measures the contribution of small unresolved fluctuations in the background emission and random map fluctuations due to receiver noise , and a basic fractional error @xmath32 , included to account for the normal inaccuracy of vla flux density calibration ( see , e.g. , weiler et al .",
    "1986 ) and possible deviations of the primary calibrator from an absolute flux density scale .",
    "the final errors ( @xmath33 ) given for the measurements of sn 1988z are taken as    @xmath34    where @xmath35 is the measured flux density , @xmath36 is the map rms for each observation , and @xmath37 for 20 , 6 , and 3.6 cm , and @xmath38 for 2 cm .",
    "following weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1990 ) and montes , weiler & panagia  ( 1997 ) , we adopt a parameterized model ( n.b . :",

    "the terms @xmath52 and @xmath53 describe the attenuation of local , homogeneous csm and clumpy csm that are near enough to the sn progenitor that they are altered by the rapidly expanding sn blastwave .",
    "@xmath52 is produced by an ionized medium that homogeneously covers the emitting source ( `` homogeneous external absorption '' ) , and the @xmath54 term describes the attenuation produced by an inhomogeneous medium ( `` clumpy absorption '' ; see natta & panagia 1984 for a more detailed discussion of attenuation in inhomogeneous media ) .",
    "both terms have a radial dependence which , under a constant mass - loss rate , constant velocity wind assumption , is r@xmath55 ( see , e.g. , van dyk et al .",
    "1994 for an example where , for sn 1993j , the radial dependence of the csm density is found to be flatter than r@xmath55 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath56 and @xmath57 determine the actual radial density profile if a constant shock velocity is assumed .",
    "the @xmath58 term describes the attenuation produced by a homogeneous medium which completely covers the source , but is so far from the sn progenitor that it is not affected by the expanding sn blastwave and is constant in time .",

    "@xmath56 and @xmath60 describe the time dependence of the optical depths for the local homogeneous and clumpy or filamentary media , respectively .",
    "the f - f optical depth outside the emitting region is proportional to the integral of the square of the csm density over the radius . since in the simple model ( chevalier 1982a , b ) the csm density decreases as @xmath61",
    ", the external optical depth will be proportional to @xmath62 , and since the radius increases as a power of time , @xmath63 ( with @xmath64 ; i.e. , @xmath65 for undecelerated blastwave expansion ) , it follows that the deceleration parameter , @xmath66 , is    @xmath67    the chevalier model relates @xmath68 and @xmath56 to the energy spectrum of the relativistic particles @xmath26 ( @xmath69 ) by @xmath70 , so that , for cases where @xmath71 and @xmath56 is , therefore , indeterminate , we can use    @xmath72    since it is physically realistic and may be needed in some rsne where radio observations have been obtained at early times and high frequencies , we have also included in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) the possibility for an internal absorption term , which is appropriate for a plane - parallel geometry , instead of the more complicated expression ( e.g. , osterbrock 1974 ) valid for the spherical case .",
    "the assumption does not affect the quality of our analysis because , to within 5% accuracy , the optical depth obtained with the spherical case formula is simply three - fourths of that obtained with the plane - parallel slab formula . ] .",
    "this internal absorption ( @xmath73 ) term may consist of two parts  synchrotron self - absorption ( ssa ; @xmath74 ) , and mixed , thermal f - f absorption / non - thermal emission ( @xmath75 ) , so that    @xmath76    where    @xmath77    and    @xmath78    with @xmath79 corresponding , formally , to the internal , non - thermal ( @xmath80 ) ssa and @xmath81 corresponding , formally , to the internal thermal ( @xmath59 ) f - f absorption mixed with nonthermal emission at 5  ghz one day after the explosion date , @xmath51 . the parameters @xmath82 and @xmath83 describe the time dependence of the optical depths for the ssa and f - f internal absorption components , respectively .",
    "a cartoon of the expected structure of an sn and its surrounding media is presented by weiler , panagia , & montes ( 2001 ; their figure 1 ) .",
    "the radio emission is expected to arise near the blastwave ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) .",
    "the success of the basic parameterization and modeling has been shown by the good correspondence between the model fits and the data for all subtypes of rsne , e.g. , the type ib sn 1983n ( sramek , panagia , & weiler 1984 ) , the type ic sn 1990b ( van dyk et al .",

    "( note that , after day @xmath84 , the evolution of the radio emission from both sne 1979c and 1980k deviates from the expected model evolution , and sn 1979c shows a sinusoidal modulation in its flux density prior to day @xmath14000 . )",
    "a more detailed discussion of sn radio observations and of modeling results is given in weiler et al .",
    "( 2002 ) .",
    "thus , the radio emission from sne appears to be relatively well understood in terms of blastwave interaction with a structured csm , as described by the chevalier ( 1982a , b ) model and its modifications by weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 , 1990 ) and montes et al .",
    "for example , the fact that the homogeneous external absorption exponent @xmath85 , or somewhat less , for most rsne is evidence that the absorbing medium is generally a wind with density @xmath86 , as expected from a massive stellar progenitor which explodes during the red supergiant ( rsg ) phase .    additionally , in their study of the radio emission from sn 1986j , weiler et al .",
    "( 1990 ) found that the simple chevalier ( 1982a , b ) model could not describe the relatively slow turn - on . they therefore included terms described mathematically by @xmath53 in equations ( [ eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq6 ] ) .",
    "this modification greatly improved the quality of the fit and was interpreted by weiler et al .",
    "( 1990 ) to represent the possible presence of filaments or clumps in the csm .",
    "such a clumpiness in the wind material was again required for modeling the radio data from sn 1993j ( van dyk et al .",
    "1994 ) and sn 1988z ( van dyk et al .",
    "since that time , evidence for filamentation in the envelopes of sne has also been found from optical and uv observations ( e.g. , filippenko , matheson , & barth 1994 : spyromilio 1994 ) .    through use of this modeling a number of physical properties of sne",
    "can be determined from the radio observations .",
    "one of these is the mass - loss rate from the sn progenitor prior to explosion . from the chevalier ( 1982a , b ) model , the turn - on of the radio emission for rsne provides a measure of the presupernova mass - loss rate to wind velocity ratio ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "weiler et al .  ( 1986 ) derived this ratio for the case of pure , external absorption by a homogeneous medium .",
    "however , we now recognize that several possible origins for absorption exist and generalize equation ( 16 ) of weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) to    @xmath88     + since the appearance of optical lines for measuring sn ejecta velocities is often delayed relative to the time of explosion , we normally adopt @xmath89 = 45 days . because our observations generally have shown that @xmath90 , and from equation ( [ eq12 ] ) @xmath91 , the dependence of the calculated mass - loss rate on the date @xmath89 of the initial ejecta velocity measurement is weak , @xmath92 .",
    "thus , we generally adopt the best optical or vlbi velocity measurements available , without worrying about the deviation of their exact measurement epoch from the assumed 45 days after explosion . for sn 1988z we follow turatto et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and assume @xmath93 km  s@xmath4  from the highest velocity measured for the broad components of the emission lines .",
    "one has to keep in mind that the actual shock velocity for sn 1988z may be even higher , because it is very hard to derive accurate velocities from fitting very broad lines where the extreme wings may be lost in the continuum .",
    "we also normally adopt values of @xmath94 k , @xmath95 km  s@xmath4  ( which is appropriate for a rsg wind ) , @xmath96 days from our best fits to the radio data , and @xmath66 from equation ( [ eq7 ] ) or ( [ eq8 ] ) , as appropriate .",
    "the optical depth absorption term , @xmath97 , however , is not as simple as that used by weiler et al .",
    "( 1986 ) .",
    "weiler et al .  (",
    "2001 ) were able to identify at least three possible absorption regimes : 1 ) absorption by a homogeneous external medium , 2 ) absorption by a clumpy or filamentary external medium with a statistically large number of clumps , and 3 ) absorption by a clumpy or filamentary medium with a statistically small number of clumps .",
    "each of the three cases requires a different formulation for @xmath97 . from our consideration of the radio light curves for sn 1988z",
    ", we conclude that the case 3 of weiler et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) is most appropriate ( see @xmath98 ) .",
    "case 3 occurs when the clump number density is small , the probability that the line - of - sight from a given clump intersects another clump is low , and both emission and absorption effectively occur within each clump",
    ". such a situation will yield a range of optical depths , from zero for clumps on the far side of the blastwave - csm interaction region , to a maximum corresponding to the optical depth through a clump for clumps on the near side of the blastwave - csm interaction region .",
    "we expect an attenuation of the form , @xmath99 , as given in equation ( [ eq2 ] ) , but now @xmath53 represents the optical depth along a clump diameter .",
    "since the clumps occupy only a small fraction of the volume , they have a volume filling factor @xmath100 .",
    "additionally , the probability that the line - of - sight from a given clump intersects another clump is low , so that a relation between the size of a clump , the number density of clumps , and the radial coordinate can be written as    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is the volume number density of clumps , @xmath103 is the radius of a clump , @xmath104 is the distance from the center of the sn to the blastwave - csm interaction region , and @xmath105 is the average number of clumps along the line - of - sight , with @xmath105 appreciably lower than unity by definition .",
    "finally , it is easy to verify that there is a relation between the volume filling factor @xmath106 , @xmath103 , @xmath104 and @xmath105 , of the form    @xmath107    we can then express the effective optical depth @xmath97 as    @xmath108    where , for initial estimates , we shall take @xmath109 and a constant ratio @xmath110 , so that , from equation ( [ eq14 ] ) , @xmath111 . before we can fully estimate the mass - loss rate , @xmath112 , for the progenitor star of sn 1988z before explosion , we must first fit our parameterized radio light curve model to the radio dataset for the sn .",
    "examination of figure 1 and table 1 shows that the multi - frequency radio data are best described by two time intervals : `` early '' data , which extends roughly from explosion through day 1479 , and `` late '' data , which roughly extends from day 2129 through the end of the dataset .",
    "figure 1 shows clear steepening of the light curves sometime between these two measurement epochs , but the actual `` break '' date is somewhat arbitrary , due to uncertainties in the flux density measurements for this relatively faint source and the likely smoothness of any transition region .",
    "we have therefore chosen to describe the flux density evolution separately for these two time intervals , with the period from day @xmath113 to day @xmath114 as a transition . with the explosion date assumed to be 1998 december 1 from optical estimates (",
    "stathakis & sadler 1991 ) , and extensive trial fitting showing no evidence for distant , homogeneous thermal absorption ( @xmath115 ) , for ssa ( @xmath116 ) , for mixed free - free absorption / nonthermal emission ( @xmath117 ) , or for a local homogeneous thermal absorption component ( @xmath118 ) , the model fitting process needs to determine only five parameters ( @xmath47 , @xmath119 , @xmath68 , @xmath49 , and @xmath120 ) . applying our fitting procedures separately to the early and late periods , with the data points between day 1500 and day 2000 included in both fits to provide a smooth transition",
    ", we find that both the spectral index , @xmath119 , and the clumpy absorption parameters , k@xmath121 and @xmath120 , are the same in the two time intervals , to within the fitting errors .",
    "however , the emission decay rate parameter , @xmath68 , steepens significantly , from @xmath122 for the early period to @xmath123 for the late period .",
    "the results of this model fitting are listed in table 3 .",
    "note that @xmath47 is a flux density scaling factor , so the fact that it has very different values for the early and the late periods is not physically significant .    for a purely clumpy csm ( @xmath118 ) , the sharp steepening of @xmath68 around day 1750 , while @xmath49 and @xmath120 remain unchanged",
    ", implies that : 1 ) the number density of clumps per unit volume , @xmath102 , starts decreasing more rapidly with radius by approximately @xmath124 ( i.e. , @xmath125 ) , with the average characteristics of the individual clumps remaining unchanged , and 2 ) most of the absorption occurs within the emitting clumps themselves . in other words ,",
    "the spatial distribution is so sparse that the average number of clumps along the line - of - sight is less than one ( @xmath126 ) .",
    "this second condition is consistent with case 3 from weiler et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) and is the basis for our selection of case 3 for sn 1988z .",
    "it is perhaps significant that weiler et al .",
    "( 2001 , 2002 ) found that case 3 also applies to the radio light curves for the unusual sn 1998bw .",
    "considering other wavelengths , we note that the h@xmath119 light curve from aretxaga et al .",
    "( 1999 ; see their figure 2 ) deviates significantly from their models after day @xmath11000 . to investigate this further ,",
    "we have plotted in figure 3 the h@xmath119 light curve after day 300 , the interval for which we have radio data .",
    "examination of figure 3 shows that the h@xmath119 light curve is consistent with a slope steepening from @xmath127 to @xmath128 after day @xmath11250 .",
    "the h@xmath119 emission is proportional to @xmath129 , while for `` typical '' sne the radio emission is proportional to @xmath130 ( i.e. , if @xmath68 is the h@xmath119 light curve decline rate , @xmath131 should be the same as @xmath132 , where @xmath133 from table 3 ) .",
    "thus , very good agreement is found between the behavior of the decline for both the early optical h@xmath119 emission - line and early radio light curves , to within the uncertainties .",
    "also , the change in the slope ( @xmath134 ) at both h@xmath119 and in the radio should be the same , because the break is due to a change in the number of clumps , not in the properties of the clumps and , therefore , should be wavelength independent : @xmath135 ; @xmath136 , which is also in fair agreement , considering the uncertainties .",
    "thus , it appears that the steepening in the decline for the nonthermal radio light curves is consistent with the steepening of the thermal h@xmath119 light curve .",
    "we can now use equations ( [ eq12 ] ) and ( [ eq15 ] ) to estimate from the radio absorption a mass - loss rate for the sn 1988z progenitor star . with the assumptions for the blastwave and csm properties discussed in",
    " 3 and the results for the best - fit parameters listed in table 3 , we obtain an estimated presupernova mass - loss rate , @xmath137 yr@xmath4 . this high mass - loss rate for sn 1988z is only appropriate for the last @xmath5 years before explosion ( see  5 ) . at earlier epochs of the progenitor s evolution",

    "figure 1 , table 3 , and @xmath98 show that the radio light curves for sn 1988z can be described by standard rsn models ( weiler et al .",

    "this change in radio emission characteristic , @xmath68 , was _ not _ accompanied by a corresponding change in the absorption characteristics , @xmath49 and @xmath120 .",
    "thus , the change in the radio light curves for sn 1988z can not be described as only due to a change in the average csm density , which so effectively described the changes in radio evolution for sn 1980k ( montes et al .",
    "1998 ) and sn 1979c ( montes et al .",
    "2000 ) .    for sn 1988z the observations",

    "since the shock velocity for sn 1988z is assumed to be @xmath139 km  s@xmath4  and the pre - supernova wind velocity for an rsg is typically @xmath140 km  s@xmath4 , an interval of 1,750 days after explosion implies that this change took place in the presupernova stellar wind @xmath141 years before explosion . with an estimated mass - loss rate in the interval prior to explosion of @xmath142 yr@xmath4 , it follows that during this last 10,000 years , the progenitor star shed @xmath143 in a massive `` superwind . ''",
    "the abrupt steepening of @xmath68 around day 1750 implies that the mass - loss rate was appreciably lower before that time , decreasing by about a factor of four by day 4,438",
    ". even such a decreasing mass - loss rate , however , still accounts for an additional @xmath144 lost in the stellar wind by our last measurement on day 4,438 ( @xmath145 years before explosion , using the same wind and blastwave velocity assumptions ) .",
    "since a relatively high mass - loss rate must have been maintained over a much longer time , such as the @xmath146 years appropriate for a massive star s evolution , an additional several @xmath7 must have been lost earlier so that the presupernova mass loss for sn 1988z over the entire rsg progenitor lifetime is expected to have been @xmath147 , and perhaps much greater .    as discussed in @xmath148 , chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) studied sn 1988z in detail and developed a model from which they concluded that the ejecta mass is small ( @xmath149 ) , and that sn 1988z , therefore , must have originated from a relatively low - mass star , @xmath2110 @xmath150 , in sharp contrast with the high - mass ( 2040 @xmath7 ) progenitor proposed by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) and stathakis & sadler ( 1991 ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that chugai & danziger derived a very high mass - loss rate for the sn 1988z progenitor , @xmath151  yr@xmath4 , yielding what they call their `` wind density parameter '' ( our @xmath87 ) of @xmath152 .",
    "we believe that our mass - loss rate derived from the direct measurement of f - f absorption in the csm , @xmath153  yr@xmath4 ( wind density parameter , @xmath154 ) , is likely more appropriate . since the critical factors in the modeling by chugai & danziger are the product of the ejecta mass and wind density parameter related to the energy of the explosion , for a given explosion energy our 67 times smaller wind density parameter implies , for their model , a factor of 67 times greater ejecta mass , @xmath15510 @xmath7 , rather than their estimate of @xmath156 .",
    "even our value for the ejecta mass may still be an underestimate because , by the chugai & danziger model , it represents only the mass that was observed to interact with the pre - supernova wind and may not involve the entire ejecta mass . with an ejecta mass of as much as @xmath157 and a high radio luminosity , which places sn",
    "1988z among the brightest radio supernovae , we conclude that the stellar progenitor of sn 1988z must have been a very massive star , perhaps as high as @xmath6 ",
    "30  @xmath7 , as previously suggested by van dyk et al .",
    "( 1993a ) .",
    "it is worth noting that all of the well - studied cases of ultra - bright rsne ( say , having @xmath15810 times the radio luminosity of sn 1979c at 6 cm peak ) , such as sne 1988z , 1986j , and 1998bw , provide evidence for a highly - clumped csm with presupernova wind mass - loss rates up to @xmath159 yr@xmath4 and unusually high shock velocities @xmath160  km  s@xmath4 . from optical and ultraviolet spectroscopy fransson et al .",
    "( 2002 ) also find for the sn iin 1995n evidence for high shock velocities , a `` superwind '' phase for the progenitor characterized by a high mass - loss rate prior to explosion , and a clumpy csm",
    ". such high - rate mass loss , clumping of the csm , and consequent high blastwave velocities may be the signature of particularly massive star progenitors ( see also the discussion in fransson et al .",
    "it is yet to be determined how the progenitors of sne iin , which must retain at least some of their hydrogen envelopes until the end of their lifetimes , and the progenitors of possibly extreme type ib / c sne , such as sn 1998bw , which must have lost their entire hydrogen envelopes before explosion , are related , if at all .",
    "the radio emission from sn 1988z followed an evolution well described by standard models up to an age of @xmath138 days ( @xmath161 yrs ) , after which its behavior evolved into a much more rapid decline in radio emission without a corresponding change in radio absorption parameters .",
    "this is the first time we have witnessed this in any well - studied rsn , and it implies that highly radio - luminous rsne , such as sn 1988z and , possibly , sn 1986j , may follow a different evolutionary path in their presupernova mass - loss than that for more `` normal '' rsne , such as sne 1979c and 1980k .",
    "however , it is interesting to note that , if one assumes a blastwave velocity @xmath3 times faster than the rsg wind - established csm ( @xmath139 km  s@xmath4  vs.  @xmath140 km  s@xmath4 ) , the timescale for such a variation in sn 1988z of @xmath162 yr , is similar to that seen for sne 1979c and 1980k ( see , e.g. , for sn 1979c , montes et al .",
    "1998 ; for sn 1980k , montes et al .",
    "2000 ) , and also for sn 1998bw ( weiler et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "in addition , further analysis of the results from chugai & danziger ( 1994 ) , which implied an extremely high mass - loss rate of @xmath163 yr@xmath4 and a relatively low - mass progenitor with @xmath2110 @xmath7 for sn 1988z , indicates that their estimates are probably unrealistic . using their modeling",
    ", our lower mass - loss rate , @xmath153 yr@xmath4 , implies a significantly higher ejecta mass and , therefore , a higher zams mass of @xmath630 @xmath7 for the progenitor star .",
    "we have noted that the h@xmath164 data from aretxaga et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which are also indicative of the sn shock - csm interaction ( chevalier & fransson 1994 ) , also begin to deviate significantly from their model by day @xmath1651250 .",
    "although a detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this paper , both the slope before the break and the magnitude of the break are roughly consistent with the radio results .    from our analysis",
    "we propose that sne , such as sne 1988z , 1986j , and 1998bw ( possibly the counterpart to grb 980425 ) , with possible very massive star progenitors ( @xmath166 ) and associated massive winds",
