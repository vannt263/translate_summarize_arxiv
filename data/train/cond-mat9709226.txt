    "<S> long - range spatial and temporal correlations are build up in these systems as a consequence of avalanche dynamics connecting metastable states . </S>",

    "<S> it has been conjectured that the generalized thermostatistics is a natural frame for studying fractally structured systems@xcite and simple relations were found between @xmath0 and the characteristic exponents of anomalous diffusion and lvy flights distributions@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> it is necessary to introduce a multifractal formalism in order to reveal its complete scaling behavior@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a central quantity in this formalism is the partition function @xmath45 , where @xmath23 represents the probability ( integrated measure ) on the @xmath24-th box among the @xmath46 boxes of the measure ( we use @xmath47 instead to the standard notation @xmath0 in order to avoid confusion with the entropic index @xmath0 ) . </S>",
    "<S> for example , in chaotic systems @xmath23 is the fraction of times the trajectory visits the box @xmath24 . in the @xmath48 limit , the contribution to @xmath49 , with a given @xmath47 , comes from a subset of all possible boxes , whose number scales with @xmath46 as @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the fractal dimension of the subset ( @xmath52 is the fractal dimension @xmath13 of the support of the measure ) . </S>",

    "<S> since the measures there are simply @xmath73 , these end points are respectively @xmath74 therefore , the entropic index @xmath0 can be put as a function of the feigenbaum s scaling factor as @xmath75    in order to determine the singularity spectrum of the critical attractor , we implemented the algorithm proposed by halsey _ </S>",

    "<S> , we have shown how the proper nonextensive statistics can be inferred from the scaling properties of the dynamical attractor at the onset of chaos in one - dimensional dissipative maps . </S>",
    "<S> the relation between the entropic index @xmath0 of generalized statistics and the multifractal singularity spectrum of the dynamical attractor was derived using quite general scaling arguments applied to the most concentrated and rarefied regions of the attractor . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed relation is therefore expected to hold for higher dimensional dissipative systems and to provide a close relationship between the nonextensive statistics formalism and the self - organized critical states of large driven dynamical systems . </S>",
