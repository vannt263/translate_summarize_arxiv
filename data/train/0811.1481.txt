    "the total and elastic proton - proton cross sections are usually described in terms of an eikonal model , which automatically satisfies @xmath1-channel elastic unitarity . to account for the possibility of excitation of the initial proton , that is for two - particle intermediate states with the proton replaced by @xmath16",
    ", we use the good - walker formalism @xcite . already at tevatron energies the absorptive correction to the elastic amplitude , due to elastic eikonal rescattering , gives about a 20% reduction of simple one pomeron exchange . after accounting for low - mass proton excitations ( that is @xmath16 s in the intermediate states )",
    "the correction becomes twice larger ( that is , up to 40% ) .",
    "next , in order to describe high - mass diffractive dissociation , @xmath17 , we have to include an extra factor of 2 from the agk cutting rules @xcite .",
    "thus , the absorptive effects in the triple - regge domain are expected to be quite large .",
    "the previous triple - regge analyses ( see , for example , @xcite ) did not allow for absorptive corrections and the resulting triple - regge couplings must be regarded , not as bare vertices , but as effective couplings embodying the absorptive effects .",
    "thus , we perform a _ new triple - regge analysis _ of the fixed - target fnal , cern - isr and tevatron data that includes the absorptive effects explicitly @xcite .",
    "the bare triple - pomeron coupling is found to be about three times larger than before ; now @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the pomeron - proton coupling .",
    "since the triple - pomeron vertex turns out to be rather large , the contribution of the so - called ` enhanced ' diagrams , with a few vertices , is not negligible .",
    "moreover , it is more reasonable to include multi - pomeron contributions with @xmath21 to @xmath22 pomeron vertices given by @xmath23 than to assume that @xmath24 for @xmath25 .",
    "these effects are included in the following evolution equation for the opacity @xmath26 in rapidity space , at given impact parameter @xmath27 @xmath28 @xmath29 where @xmath30 .",
    "let us explain the meanings of the three terms on the right hand side of ( [ eq : evol1 ] ) .",
    "if only the last factor , ( a ) , is present then the evolution generates the ladder - type structure of the bare pomeron exchange amplitude , where the pomeron trajectory @xmath31 .",
    "the inclusion of ( b ) allows for rescatterings of an intermediate parton @xmath32 with the `` target '' proton @xmath33 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : evol](a ) shows the simplest ( single ) rescattering which generates the triple - pomeron diagram .",
    "finally , ( c ) allows for rescatterings with the beam @xmath34 . in this way",
    "we include the absorptive effects generated by all multi - pomeron diagrams like the one shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : evol](b ) .",
    "there is an analogous equation for the evolution of @xmath35 , and the two equations may be solved iteratively .",
    "a detailed discussion can be found in @xcite , where @xmath36 is set to zero .     of the proton ; the rapidity @xmath37 spans an interval 0 to y = lns .",
    "( b ) a multi - pomeron diagram.,height=113 ]      besides allowing for @xmath38 , a new development is an analysis @xcite in which we allow for four different @xmath2-channel states , which we label @xmath39 : one for the secondary reggeon ( @xmath40 ) trajectory and three pomeron states ( @xmath41 ) to mimic the bfkl diffusion in the logarithm of parton transverse momentum , @xmath42 @xcite . to be precise , since the bfkl pomeron @xcite is not a pole in the complex @xmath43-plane , but a branch cut , we approximate the cut by three @xmath2-channel states of a different size . the typical values of @xmath44 in each of the three states is about @xmath45 gev , @xmath46 gev and @xmath47 gev . thus ( [ eq : evol1 ] ) is replaced by @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 for @xmath51 , while for the secondary reggeon , @xmath52 , which is built of quarks , we take @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "the transition factors @xmath55 were fixed by properties of the bfkl equation . in the exponents , the opacities @xmath56 ( @xmath57 )",
    "are actually the sum of the opacities @xmath58 ( @xmath59 ) with corresponding coefficients .     cross sections and ( c ) the cross sections of dissociation to a fixed @xmath60 state , where @xmath61 .",
    "plot ( d ) shows the parton multiplicity ( solid lines ) and the number of ` colour tubes ' ( dashed ) produced by the pomeron components of different size.,height=566 ]    [ fig : data ]    such a model allows us to reproduce all the available data on diffractive cross sections , @xmath62 .",
    "we find that the triple - pomeron coupling parameter @xmath63 and that @xmath64 for all three components of the pomeron , consistent with the expectations of resummed nll bfkl which gives @xmath65 pratically independent of @xmath44 @xcite .",
    "the slopes , @xmath66 , are 0.05 , 0.005 and 0 gev@xmath67 for the large , intermediate and small size components of the pomeron respectively .",
    "the model allows us , in principle , to predict all features of soft @xmath0 high energy interactions .",
    "examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : data ] .",
    "note that , due to absorptive effects , the total cross section at the lhc energy @xmath68 tev is predicted to be only about 90 mb .",
    "also , the multiplicities of the secondaries produced by the @xmath2-channel pomeron components of different sizes , are shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : data](d ) .",
    "we see that , starting with the same ` bare ' intercepts ( @xmath69 ) , after the absorptive correction , the contribution of the large - size component becomes practically flat , while the small - size contribution , which is much less affected by the absorption , continues to grow with energy .",
    "such a behaviour is consistent with experiment , where the density of low @xmath44 secondaries is practically saturated , while the probability to produce a hadron with a large transverse momentum ( say , more than 5 gev ) grows with the initial energy .",
    "we have already emphasised the value of the observation of an exclusive process of the type @xmath10 at the lhc @xcite .",
    "the process is sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : pap ] .",
    "the case of @xmath70 is particularly interesting .",
    "the cross section is usually written in the form ( pp p+a+p )  ~   | nf_g(x_1,x_1,q^2_t,^2)f_g(x_2,x_2,q^2_t,^2 ) | ^2 [ eq : d1 ] where @xmath71 is the @xmath2-slope of the proton - pomeron vertex , and the constant @xmath72 is known in terms of the @xmath73 decay width .",
    "the amplitude - squared factor , @xmath74 , can be calculated in perturbative qcd , since the dominant contribution to the integral comes from the region @xmath75 , for the large values of @xmath76 of interest .",
    "the probability amplitudes , @xmath77 , to find the appropriate pairs of @xmath2-channel gluons @xmath78 and @xmath79 of fig .",
    "[ fig : pap ] , are given by skewed unintegrated gluon densities at a hard scale @xmath80 .",
    "to evaluate the cross section of such an exclusive processes it is important to know the probability , @xmath81 , that the rapidity gaps survive and will not be filled by secondaries from eikonal and enhanced rescattering effects .",
    ", with the eikonal and enhanced survival factors shown symbolically .",
    "the thick lines on the pomeron ladders , either side of the subprocess ( @xmath82 ) , indicate the rapidity interval @xmath83 where enhanced absorption is not permitted @xcite.,height=151 ]    the model of soft interactions described above gives a gap survival probability @xmath84 , obtained with the @xmath2 dependence of our model , to its value corresponding to an exponential slope @xmath85 gev@xmath67 , then we obtain @xmath86 , which is consistent with our previous estimate @xcite , see the discussion below . ] with respect to the _ eikonal _ ( including the elastic and low - mass proton excitation ) rescattering , for the exclusive production of a higgs boson .",
    "the model may also be used to calculate the absorptive correction to exclusive cross sections caused by the so - called _ enhanced _ diagrams , that is by the interaction with the intermediate partons , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pap ] .",
    "this rescattering violates ` soft - hard ' factorisation , since the probability of such an interaction depends both on the transverse momentum and on the impact parameter of the intermediate parton .",
    "the model predicts @xmath87 .",
    "we emphasize that comparing the values of the survival factors in this way is too simplistic .",
    "the problem is that , with enhanced screening on intermediate partons , we no longer have exact factorisation between the hard and soft parts of the process . thus , before computing the effect of soft absorption we must fix what is included in the bare exclusive amplitude calculated in terms of perturbative qcd .",
    "two observations are importrant .",
    "the _ first _ observation is that the bare amplitude is calculated as a convolution of two generalised ( skewed ) gluon distributions with the hard subprocess matrix element , see ( [ eq : d1 ] ) .",
    "these gluon distributions are determined from integrated gluon distributions of a global parton analysis of mainly deep inelastic scattering data .",
    "now , the phenomenological integrated parton distributions already include the interactions of the intermediate partons with the parent proton .",
    "thus calculations of @xmath88 should keep only contributions which embrace the hard matrix element of the type shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pap ] .",
    "the _ second _ observation is that the phenomenologically determined generalised gluon distributions , @xmath77 , are usually taken at @xmath89 and then the observed `` total '' exclusive cross section is calculated by integrating over @xmath90 of the recoil protons assuming the an exponential behaviour @xmath91 ; that is dp^2_t  e^-bp_t^2  =  1/b  =  p_t^2 .",
    "however , the total soft absorptive effect changes the @xmath90 distribution in comparison to that for the bare cross section determined from perturbative qcd .",
    "thus the additional factor introduced by the soft interactions is not just the gap survival @xmath3 , but rather the factor @xmath92 @xcite , which strictly speaking has the form @xmath93 .    in order to compare determinations of the suppression due to absorptive effects",
    "we should compare only the values of the complete cross section for @xmath10 .",
    "however , a comparison is usually made by reducing the cross section to a factorized form .",
    "if this is done , as in ( [ eq : d1 ] ) , then the predictions for the survival factor to eikonal and enhanced screening of the exclusive production of a 120 gev higgs at the lhc are @xmath94 where enhanced screening is only permitted outside a threshold rapidity gap @xcite @xmath95 respectively , see fig .",
    "[ fig : pap ] .",
    "the values correspond to @xmath96 . that is , allowing for the threshold effect , we predict @xmath97 .",
    "we have described a model , tuned to the existing data , which is capable of predicting all features of high energy soft @xmath0 interactions .",
    "absorptive effects are found to be large .",
    "for example , the total @xmath0 cross section is predicted to be only about 90 mb at the lhc energy @xmath68 tev .",
    "we used this model to estimate the exclusive cross section for higgs production , @xmath4 , at the lhc .",
    "we calculated the survival factor of the rapidity gaps to both eikonal and enhanced rescattering and found @xmath97 .",
    "note that , from exclusive cdf data and leading neutron data at hera , there is evidence that @xmath98 is somewhat larger than the estimates obtained here , such that @xmath99 is nearer the upper limit of the quoted interval .",
    "early lhc runs can measure @xmath98 @xcite .",
