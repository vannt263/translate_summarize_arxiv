    "the main goal of hadron electromagnetic form factors studies is to obtain information about hadron structure .",
    "the most complete data on the behavior of the form factor as a function of four - momentum transferred is obtained for pion and nucleon . to investigate form factor of hadron @xmath6 two reactions",
    "are used : the reaction of elastic scattering of electrons by hadron @xmath7 ( so - called space - like region of the four - momentum transferred ) and the reaction of hadron - antihadron pair production in the electron - positron annihilation @xmath8 or inverse reaction ( time - like region ) .",
    "high precision data on the electromagnetic form factor of a proton in the time - like region became available due to ps170 experiment performed at lear ( cern ) and recent babar experiment , where the reactions @xmath9 were reported  @xcite .",
    "bes collaboration  @xcite has observed the near - threshold enhancement of the @xmath0 - system in the @xmath10 decay .",
    "these data demonstrate principally different behavior of the electromagnetic baryon form factor in the time - like region from that of a pion .",
    "the proton form factor drops quickly with momentum increasing from the threshold ( approximately two times in the energy range from the threshold to @xmath11 , corresponding to change of c.m .",
    "relative momentum from zero to @xmath12 ) .    to describe the behavior of the form factor different vector dominance models ( vdm ) are used .",
    "these models successfully reproduce the behavior of the pion form factor both in space - like and time - like regions  @xcite and the behavior of the nucleon ( proton and neutron ) form factors in the space - like regions  @xcite , but they fail in description of the proton form factor in the time - like region . also several explanations of the energy behavior for proton form factor",
    "were considered after obtaining of the experimental data ( see  @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "another approach was proposed  @xcite to understand physics of the behavior of the baryon electromagnetic form factor in the time - like region just near threshold .",
    "this approach takes into account final state interaction ( interaction in the baryon - antibaryon system ) as dominant physical reason giving form factor energy behavior and its value near @xmath5 threshold . in this model",
    "the form factor is factorized according to different physical processes .",
    "form factor is presented as a product of a factor corresponding to singularities of transition amplitude lying far from @xmath5 threshold and a factor reflecting strong final state interaction .",
    "the later gives the energy dependence of the form factor .",
    "moreover , the behavior of the form factor appears to be directly connected to other observables in the @xmath5 system .",
    "for instance , it is possible to extract imaginary part of baryon - antibaryon scattering length using the form factor energy dependence near @xmath5 threshold .",
    "note that the consideration which was proposed in  @xcite is a natural consequence of the main features of quasi - nuclear model of low energy baryon - antibaryon interaction  @xcite .",
    "the near - threshold enhancement was predicted in  @xcite long time before first experimental indications",
    ".    mentioned approach predicts peculiar behavior of the proton form factor in the time - like region and , moreover , it turns to be possible to predict the behavior of the neutron form factor .",
    "these predictions differ sufficiently from the predictions of standard vdm model .",
    "the neutron form factor can not exceed the proton one , whereas all vector dominance models obtain the neutron form factor five - ten times more than the proton one .    established connection of the behavior of the hadron form factor with the interaction in the hadron - antihadron system gives us unique possibility to investigate these systems .",
    "the main advantage of the baryon - antibaryon pair production in electron - positron collisions is that there is no initial state interaction and transition mechanism is well - determined .",
    "however , even existing facilities allows us to obtain such an information from the  form - factor  experiments with @xmath13 beams ( for instance for systems with hidden strangeness like @xmath14 , or with hidden charm and beauty like @xmath15 , @xmath5 , etc . ) in the following we will discuss existing data on the @xmath14 production .",
    "there is additional group of experiments with @xmath13 beams which can give more information about hadron - anti - hadron interaction in the final state . in case of nucleon - antinucleon",
    "these are experiments on electron - positron annihilation into multipion systems which are dominant modes of nucleon - antinucleon annihilation . in this reactions",
    "nucleon - antinucleon system appears as an intermediate state .",
    "the quantum numbers of the @xmath16 system are those of photon , as far as @xmath16 are created from electron - positron pair through a photon .",
    "even or odd amount of pions in the final state fixes isospin of a system .",
    "this gives unique opportunity to prepare the nucleon - antinucleon system in a state with definite quantum numbers .",
    "let us mention that the deep - bump structure  @xcite observed in the electron - positron annihilation into six pions near nucleon - antinucleon threshold was explained in  @xcite as a property of @xmath16 intermediate state ( namely the green function zero of @xmath17  @xcite ) . from these data",
    "the existence of a new narrow vector @xmath16 state was predicted  @xcite . in experiments with @xmath18 scattering on nuclear targets",
    "the direct observation of new subthreshold @xmath16 state is possible , but requires special theoretical considerations due to cancelation of non - adiabatic and off - mass shell effects  @xcite .",
    "the main advantage of the approach suggested in  @xcite and developed here is its ability to describe simultaneously the properties of nucleon - antinucleon interaction , electromagnetic form factor of the nucleon in the time - like region , and multipion electron - positron annihilation near @xmath16 threshold .",
    "the article is organized the following way .",
    "section 2 is devoted to the general properties of the form factor in the time - like region and the case of nucleon form factor . in section 3",
    "we discuss form factor properties of other hadrons .",
    "conclusion and proposals of new experiments are presented in secton 4 .",
    "in this section we investigate general properties of the hadron form factor in the time - like region near the boundary of the physical region . for different hadrons we can have different number of form factors , depending on hadron spin .",
    "we will formulate the main results for a proton and neutron , the generalization for other hadrons will be done in section 4 .",
    "the form factor of the nucleon ( @xmath19 ) in the time - like region is determined from the reaction of @xmath13-annihilation into nucleon - antinucleon pair @xmath20 or vice versa .",

    "are equal and for simplicity hereafter they are taken to be equal in the kinetic energy region of few tens of mev near the threshold .    before doing any calculations we can make some conclusions about nucleon form factor near threshold .",

    "[ diagram ] ) .",
    "grey block in this diagram presents the final state interaction in the system @xmath16 .",
    "we know that this interaction is very strong and even can produce bound states in the @xmath16 system  @xcite .",
    "left part of the diagram corresponds to the transition amplitude from @xmath13 pair into @xmath16 pair .",
    "black circle in this transition amplitude denotes a connection between a photon and @xmath16 pair , which can be realized for example by vector mesons ( @xmath40 or @xmath41 ) .",
    "since @xmath16 annihilation interaction is short - range the form factor can be factorized as follows : @xmath42 here @xmath43 is connected to the amplitude of the normalized wave - function near zero : @xmath44    the factor @xmath45 corresponds to singularities far from @xmath16 threshold ( for instance , to a connection of the photon to the nucleon through @xmath40- or @xmath41-exchanges , as it can be written in usual vector dominance models ) and is practically constant in the kinetic energy region of few tens of mev in the @xmath16 center of mass system .",
    "the factor @xmath43 reflects the influence of strong final state interaction and contains main energy dependence of the form factor ( [ ff ] ) in the near - threshold region .",
    "the general form of energy behavior is given by the following expression ( see appendix a ) : @xmath46 here @xmath47 is the @xmath16 scattering phase , @xmath48 is an function of @xmath49 , determined by the properties of the @xmath16 potential . in the case of @xmath37scattering @xmath50 and eq .",

    "very small @xmath25 the role of the coulomb corrections is of special interest ( see appendix a ) . in this case",

    "the coulomb corrections becomes important when @xmath60 , for @xmath0 system it means @xmath61 . in the case of @xmath62wave the @xmath63 factor near threshold is given by the following expression ( appendix a ) : @xmath64 here @xmath65 is the scattering volume , @xmath66 is @xmath25independent coefficient .    in the region not too close to the threshold ( @xmath67 ) ,",
    "it is not possible to get model independent information about the properties of @xmath16 potential .",
    "for such a purpose we suggest a simple phenomenological model of @xmath16 interaction based on the following assumptions .",
    "first , the tail of @xmath16 potential is considered attractive and above a certain matching interbaryonic distance @xmath68 it can be approximated by exponential potential : @xmath69 here @xmath40 is a free diffuseness parameter .",
    "second , the effective depth of @xmath16 interaction below @xmath68 is much greater than a collision energy of interest .",
    "it means that at matching distance @xmath68 the @xmath16 non - relativistic wave - function @xmath70 obeys the _ energy independent _ boundary condition , which can be conveniently parameterized in the following way : @xmath71 here @xmath72 , @xmath73 is a free parameter .",
    "we use the closed form solution of the schredinger equation with the exponential potential ( see appendix b ) to get the following expression for the @xmath37wave form - factor : @xmath74 here we introduced phase parameter @xmath75 .",

    "we have two model parameters : the diffuseness @xmath40 of the potential tail and the complex phase @xmath78 , which describes the influence of the deep inner part of @xmath16 interaction . in the limit of small @xmath25 we return to eq.([gthresh ] ) with the imaginary part of the scattering length given by the following expression : @xmath79 in case @xmath80 ( strong absorption by the inner part of @xmath16 interaction ) the form factor becomes insensitive to parameter @xmath78 .",
    "in such a case the imaginary part of the scattering length turns to be : @xmath81 while the form factor is : @xmath82 in the opposite case of weak absorption @xmath83 the form factor is sensitive to the phase @xmath78 , especially when @xmath84 .",
    "this corresponds to the appearance of a quasi - bound @xmath16 state close to the threshold . in such a resonant case",
    "the value of the imaginary part of the scattering length can be much greater than the diffuseness of potential tail : @xmath85 the form factor in the resonant case turns to be : @xmath86 the important property of suggested model is the ability to describe the form factor energy behavior beyond the scattering length and effective range approximations i.e. for @xmath87 . in the limit @xmath88",
    "the form factor behaves like : @xmath89 so far the above model describes the transition from fast exponential decay @xmath90 of the form factor just near the threshold to the @xmath91 behavior away from the threshold .",
    "such a transition takes place when @xmath92 .",
    "the experimental data fit in such a transition region enables us to extract diffuseness parameter @xmath40 , while the data fit near the threshold gives the imaginary part of the scattering length and so far the phase parameter @xmath78 .",
    "this property of the model gives an opportunity to distinguish the nearthreshold resonance in the form factor behavior , characterized by the imaginary part of the scattering length much larger than the potential tail diffuseness @xmath93 .",
