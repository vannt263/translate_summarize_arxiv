    "it is now generally accepted that the class of objects referred to as `` anomalous x - ray pulsars '' ( axps ) are magnetars ",
    "young isolated neutron stars powered by their high magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "axps are x - ray pulsars with periods in the range 212  s , and x - ray luminosities ( @xmath8  erg  s@xmath9 ) that can not be accounted for by their available spin - down energy .",
    "the magnetar model was first proposed to explain the dramatic behavior exhibited by an apparently different object class  the soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) .",
    "sgrs show persistent properties similar to axps , but they were first discovered by their enormous bursts of soft gamma rays ( @xmath10  erg ) and their much more frequent , shorter , and thus less energetic bursts of hard x - rays . to date , sgr - like x - ray bursts have been observed from five axps , thus solidifying the connection between the two source classes @xcite . for reviews of magnetar candidates and axps",
    "see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "thus far , only the magnetar model can explain the bursts observed from sgrs and axps @xcite .",
    "the internal magnetic field exerts stresses on the crust which can lead to large scale rearrangements of the external field , which we observe as giant flares .",
    "if the stress is more localized , then it can fracture the crust and displace the footpoints of the external magnetic field which results in short x - ray bursts .",
    "the highly twisted internal magnetic field also slowly twists up the external field ; magnetospheres of magnetars may therefore be globally twisted @xcite .",
    "reconnection in this twisted magnetosphere has also been proposed as an additional mechanism for the short bursts @xcite .",
    "in addition to bursts , axps and sgrs exhibit pulsed and persistent flux variations on multiple different timescales .",
    "an hours - long increase in the pulsed flux has been seen to follow a burst in axp 1e  1048.15937  @xcite . on longer timescales",
    ", axps can exhibit abrupt increases in flux which decay on several - week timescales .",
    "these occur in conjunction with bursts and have been suggested as being due to thermal radiation from the stellar surface after the deposition of heat from bursts .",
    "such flux enhancements have been observed in sgrs ( see * ? ? ? * for example ) .",
    "the flux enhancement of axp 1e  2259@xmath11586during its 2002 outburst can also interpreted as burst afterglow @xcite , however , a magnetospheric interpretation is also plausible @xcite .",
    "axp 1e  1048.15937  exhibited three unusual flux ` flares . ' in the first two , the pulsed flux rose on week - long timescales and subsequently decayed back on time scales of months @xcite .",
    "these variations have been tentatively attributed to twists implanted in the external magnetosphere from stresses on the crust imposed by the internal magnetic field .",
    "axps xte  j1810197 , 1e  1547.0@xmath15408 , and the axp candidate ax  j18450258  have also exhibited large flux variations @xcite , however it is not clear whether these were of the abrupt rise type as in 1e  2259@xmath11586  or the slow - rise type as in 1e  1048.15937 .",

    "it has a period derivative of @xmath12  =  0.2  @xmath13 , implying a surface dipole magnetic field of 1.3  @xmath14  g. 4u  0142 + 61 was monitored by _ rxte _ in 1997 and from 2000 to 2007 .",

    "these lightcurves were searched for bursts using our automated burst search algorithm introduced in @xcite and discussed further in @xcite . in an observation on 2006",

    "the bursts were significant in each active pcu .",
    "see table  [ tab : obs ] for the number of active pcus in each burst observation , as well as for the burst observation epochs .    to analyze these bursts we created event lists in fits format using the standard ` ftools ` . for consistency with previous analyses of sgr / axp bursts we extracted events in the 2 - 60  kev band .",

    "our techniques for characterizing the temporal and spectral properties of bursts were discussed in detail in @xcite but we repeat them here as some required modification in order address the distinct properties of these bursts .    before measuring any burst parameters we determined the instrumental background using the ` ftool ` ` pcabackest ` .",
    "we extracted a background model lightcurve using the appropriate energy band and number of pcus . `",
    "pcabackest ` determines the background count rate only on 16-s time intervals , so we interpolated these values by fitting a polynomial of order 6 to the entire observation , which yielded a good fit for each data set .",
    "the burst peak time ( @xmath17 ) , rise time ( @xmath18 ) and peak flux ( @xmath19 ) were determined using the methods described in @xcite .",
    "usually , to measure the fluence for sgr and axp bursts , we subtract the instrumental background for the lightcurve , integrate the light curve and fit the result to a step function with a linear term whose slope is the `` local '' background rate .",
    "the burst fluence in this case is the height of the step function .",
    "although this technique worked well for the first burst , which was a short , isolated event , it was not appropriate for bursts 2 , 3 , and 4 because they had overlapping tails , and bursts 5 and 6 had tails that extended beyond the end of the observation . thus , we opted to fit the burst flux time series , @xmath20 , with exponential rises and decays : @xmath21 the burst peak time ( @xmath17 ) , the burst rise time ( @xmath18 ) , the peak flux ( @xmath19 ) , the instrumental background model ( @xmath22 ) determined using ` pcabackest ` and the `` local '' background ( @xmath23 ) were held fixed at the values determined by the methods outlined above .",
    "we fit for the flux of the long - term tail component of the burst , and for the short ( @xmath24 ) and long - term ( @xmath25 ) decay times of the tail of the burst .",

    "burst spectra were extracted using all the counts within their @xmath27 interval .",

    "the features showed clear temporal variability and were most prominent near the onset of the burst ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : dynamic ] ) .",
    "we looked closely at the first 5  s of the burst ( see fig .",

    "a simple photoelectrically absorbed blackbody yielded a reduced @xmath28 of 2.54 for 41 degrees of freedom ( dof ) . adding one or two gaussian emission lines improved the fit but not sufficiently , yielding reduced @xmath28s of 1.89 for 38 dof , and 1.67 for 35 dof , respectively .",

    ".    independent evidence for slow crustal deformations in 4u  0142@xmath1161  that could result in the regions of slower - rotating superfluid required to explain the spin - down may come from the long - term flux and pulse profile evolution previously reported for this source by @xcite and shown again here in figures 5 and 6 .",

    "it remains to be seen if detailed modeling can reproduce the sort of slow pulse profile changes we have observed ( fig .",
    "5 ) , quite apart from the sudden appearance of new peaks , hence greater harmonic structure , near bursts .",
    "we note that the latter has also recently been seen during periods of activity in 1e  1048.15937@xcite .",
    "previously @xcite noted that the existence of axp glitches having properties comparable to those seen rotation - powered pulsars was not in itself evidence for axps being magnetars .",
    "this is because the standard glitch model applies regardless of the mechanism by which the crust slows down ; in principle a glitch can occur in an accretion - powered neutron star , since in this case too there should develop a crust / superfluid angular velocity lag .",

    "in many ways , the 2006 - 2007 active phase of 4u  0142@xmath1161  is similar to other phases of activity seen in axps : it was punctuated by short bursts , pulse profile changes were seen , and it was accompanied by a significant rotational anomaly . however the 4u  0142@xmath1161  activity is unique in one interesting way : the pulsar did not suffer a large , long - lived pulse flux increase at the beginning of the phase . indeed",

    "this seems unlikely , however only focusing telescope observations can rule this out .",
    "other axp radiative outbursts have been suggested as arising from large magnetospheric twists , with associated magnetospheric currents returning to the stellar surface and heating it , resulting in increased x - ray emission from the source ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "such twists are thought to represent a release of magnetic energy and helicity from the internally wound - up magnetic field .    on the assumption that the pulsed flux is a reasonable proxy for the total flux for 4u  0142@xmath1161 , here , we find no clear evidence for significantly increased x - ray emission on time scales longer than a few minutes .",
    "thus any large - scale magnetospheric twist scenario is problematic . as originally showed by @xcite , the x - ray luminosity due to returning currents reheating the surface in a significantly twisted magnetosphere in general",
    "are comparable to that produced from internal processes ; this is clearly not observed in the 2006 - 7 active period of 4u  0142@xmath1161 .    instead , for this source , long - term evolution of the crust , driven presumably internally by field decay , and resulting in multiple unstable configurations though without any large scale magnetospheric twists , could result in sudden cracking and local rearrangements .",
    "this could be accompanied by bursts and profile changes , as well as with vortex line shifting .",
    "why such surface motion does not produce significant magnetospheric twists is , however , puzzling , given that field lines are thought to be anchored in the crust ; perhaps only for large motions do field lines become sufficiently twisted for enhanced x - ray emission to be produced .",
    "@xcite showed that other axp glitches have been unaccompanied by radiative changes .",
    "for example , axp 1e  1841045  has glitched multiple times yet its pulsed flux remains very steady .",
    "such radiatively `` silent '' glitches may be a result of internal activity that does not result in significant twisting of outer magnetosphere field lines , where as radiatively `` loud '' glitches could be those for which the magnetosphere is impacted .",
    "we note in fact that thus far , the data are consistent with _ all _ axp radiative outbursts being accompanied by timing anomalies .",
    "this may also be true of sgrs , though in those cases , timing anomalies are harder to establish because of the difficulty in achieving phase - coherent timing in quiescence .",
    "we have reported on anomalous x - ray pulsar 4u  0142@xmath1161  entering an active phase which was preceded with by a long - term increase in pulsed flux .",
    "the active phase , which commenced in 2006 march , consisted of a timing anomaly that can be described as a net `` anti - glitch , '' that is , a net spin - down following an initial spin - up that decayed on a time scale of 17 days . following the glitch",
    ", we detected six bursts from the pulsar , the first ever observed from this source . despite 10  yr of _ rxte _  monitoring , the bursts all occurred in the narrow time span between 2006 april 6 and 2007 february 7 .",
    "the sixth and largest burst had a unusual spectrum that can not be described by any simple continuum model .",
    "rather , it can be well fit if a prominent spectral feature at @xmath1514  kev is included , as has been reported in other axp bursts , as well as weaker features at @xmath158 and @xmath1521  kev .",
    "the pulse profile of the source changed from double- to triple- peaked near the bursts , and underwent considerable evolution otherwise . at the burst",
    "epochs the relative intensity of the three peaks significantly varied .",
    "the pulse profile is now relaxing to its pre - active phase morphology .",
    "most aspects of 4u  0142@xmath1161 s emission changed during the active phase , with the notable exception of the pulsed flux ( except near bursts ) .",
    "this argues against this event being associated with a sudden magnetospheric twist , as has been invoked for other axp activity , and is suggestive of crustal evolution driven internally by the large magnetic field , though without significant magnetospheric twisting .",
    "we suggest that other , radiatively silent axp glitches have a similar origin , whereas radiatively loud axp timing events occur when the crustal motions can not avoid significant twisting of the magnetic field lines .",

    "<S> upon entry into the active phase the pulsar showed a significant change in pulse morphology and a likely timing glitch . </S>",
    "<S> the glitch had a total frequency jump of ( 1.9@xmath50.4@xmath610@xmath7  hz , which recovered with a decay time of 17@xmath52  days by more than the initial jump , implying a net spin - down of the pulsar . </S>",
