    "one of the scopes of this section was testing that _ mildly _ mixed dm models , in the presence of a significant cdm ",
    "de coupling , are reasonably consistent with data .",
    "this paper performs a first inspection on the possibility that high @xmath12 masses and cdm  de coupling yield compensating distortions of matter fluctuations and cmb spectra .",

    ", the de plateau , extending up to the equality redshift , occurring slightly above @xmath65 , shows a de density keeping @xmath66 of cdm.__,title=\"fig : \" ]    + .1truecm    this question should be carefully addressed by using montecarlo techniques and considering all available observational constraints .",
    "unfortunately , to do so , we should widen the usual parameter space , by adding 3 extra degrees of freedom : the coupling parameter @xmath33 , neutrino mass , and the energy scale @xmath30 in the sugra model ( or another equivalent parameter , in the same or in another dynamical de potential ) .",
    "this is among the reasons that led previous authors to perform a preliminary test by using a fisher matrix technique .",
    "as is known , a fm analysis assumes that a given cosmology has a top likelihood and explores its neighbours .",
    "we can imagine , _",
    "e.g. _ that the data favor @xmath67 in association with a significant @xmath12 mass .",
    "a fm analysis would hardly tell us that .",
    "this calls for a mcmc analysis that we reserve for future work .",
    "taking fm outputs at face value leads to state that models with @xmath68 and @xmath46 are observationally consistent with a @xmath69 and @xmath35 model .",
    "models with cde were initially considered to overcome the _ coincidence _ problem , in the presence of de . to achieve this aim",
    ", one has to accept that de is characterized by two different scales . for a coupled sugra cosmology like the one explored here , they are about the ew and the planck scales .",
    "no _ ad  hoc _ scale is then apparently introduced , but the whole framework appears somehow artificial and demands for a more basic scheme , to reduce its complexity .",
    "an example is the _",
    "double  axion _ model @xcite , which however leads to features different from the ones considered here",
    ".    still working at a phenomenological level , in figure [ coinci ] , we however show the scale dependence of the density parameters , for various models with different @xmath32 and @xmath33 .    in the usual case , with negligible @xmath70 , a cdm  de coupling compatible with data hardly eases the coincidence problem .",
    "such easing is represented by the _ plateau _ in the @xmath71 curve , whose proportions are then almost insignificant .",
    "this does not mean that @xmath72 is not to be considered among the possible degrees of freedom ; _",
    "e.g. _ , in @xcite it is shown that a cosmology with @xmath33 as small as @xmath73 , if inspected assuming @xmath74 , can yield wrong values for some cosmic parameters , including @xmath75 .",
    "figure [ coinci ] however indicates that , when @xmath76 is recovered , in the presence of suitably massive @xmath12 s , a significant _ plateau _ is present and de density keeps at the level @xmath77@xmath78 of the critical density up to @xmath79 .",
