    "ever since the first observation of coherent population trapping ( cpt ) @xcite - @xcite this phenomenon has stimulated experimental and theoretical investigations . starting with the study of dark resonances in @xmath0-systems where",
    "two lower levels are coupled to a common upper state by two coherent light fields @xcite new phenomena like electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) @xcite , enhanced index of refraction without absorption @xcite and lasing without inversion ( lwi ) @xcite - @xcite have been investigated . due to the potentially extreemly steep dispersion at the cpt resonance , group velocities",
    "were recently detected which are orders of magnitude smaller than the vacuum speed of light @xcite .",
    "coherent population trapping in a @xmath0-system arises when a coherence between the two lower levels is established by a nonlinear process .",
    "experimentally this can be achieved by applying two lasers simultaneously , each coupling one of the lower levels near resonantly to the common upper state .",
    "when the difference between the two laser frequencies matches exactly the lower level splitting ( which can be zero ) the atom is optically pumped into a coherent superposition of the two lower states . in this case",
    "no further light is absorbed @xcite .",
    "since the two ground states are radiatively stable , the ground - state coherence can have long lifetimes leading to extremely narrow resonances .",
    "systems with other level schemes have also been studied , e.g. v - systems or cascade - systems .",
    "needless to say that many of the properties of these systems have been investigated experimentally and theoretically in much detail @xcite . in this work",
    "we will focus on the discussion of nonlinear behaviour in a v - system , where the two upper states have very _ different lifetimes_.    a theoretical investigation of this kind is triggered by our work with single in@xmath1 ions @xcite where the v - system is realized by the @xmath2 ground state coupled to the two upper levels @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively ( see fig",
    ". 1c ) . since the @xmath2 - @xmath4 intercombination line ( clock transition ) , induced by magnetic dipole hyperfine interaction ,",
    "is highly suppressed , the lifetime of this state is rather long , with a lifetime of @xmath5 195 ms ( @xmath6 0.82 hz ) .",
    "it is longer by a factor of @xmath7 than the lifetime of the dipole allowed @xmath2 - @xmath3 ( cooling ) transition , with @xmath8 440 ns ( @xmath9 360 khz ) .",
    "the _ narrow _",
    "@xmath2 - @xmath4 transition used as a probe allows thus to explore sensitively unusual features and regimes .",
    "single trapped ions are particularly useful for studying coherence effects .",
    "they fulfill most prerequisits needed for ultra - high resolution spectroscopy : by cooling the ion to the ground state of the trap the particle is well localized in the lamb - dicke - regime @xcite and almost free of motion . thus transit - time and first - order doppler linebroadening",
    "are eliminated and the second - order doppler effect can be reduced to negligible values .",
    "sufficiently low pressures in the vacuum chamber avoid broadening due to collisions . in the case of a single ion",
    "no averaging over spacially varying laser intensities or atomic densities has to be taken into account , and no trap dynamics ( e.g. spacially varying zeemanshifts ) need to be considered . in case of in@xmath1 , due to the absence of hyperfine structure and the metastability of level @xmath4 , no repumping or zeeman - substructure has to be taken into account in the theoretical description .",
    "a true closed 3-level system is realized in this case .",
    "as far as nonlinear spectroscopy with single ions is concerned coherence effects have been investigated in ba@xmath1 @xcite - @xcite . here",
    ", a @xmath0-system was investigated where the laser transitions were strongly dipole - allowed .",
    "the participating states had thus similar transition probabilities .",
    "this is in contrast to the level scheme investigated here where the two upper states of the v - system have very different lifetimes .",
    "this is what leads to the unusual coherence effects investigated in this paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section 2 we introduce our theoretical model and present numerical results for the fluorescence on the fast transition .",
    "we discuss different regimes of fluorescence depending on the power of the clock laser . in section 3",
    "we show how the numerical results of section 2 can be understood in terms of analytical calculations if we specialize for the case of on - resonance pumping . in section 4",
    "we deal with the general case of arbitrary pump - detuning . here , only numerical results are presented , as space does not permit us to present the analytical results .",
    "in order to model the v - configuration in in@xmath1 we consider an atomic system with levels @xmath10 and @xmath11 which are coupled to a common lower level @xmath12 ( see fig .",
    "1a ) . as in in@xmath1",
    ", we suppose that @xmath10 lies energetically higher than @xmath11 .",
    "the two transitions @xmath12 - @xmath10 and @xmath12 - @xmath11 with transition frequencies @xmath13 and @xmath14 are driven by two laser fields , @xmath15 and @xmath16 , at rabi frequencies @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively .",
    "the atom can decay by spontaneous emission from @xmath10 to @xmath12 at a rate @xmath19 and from @xmath11 to @xmath12 at a rate @xmath20 , where we neglect the decay channel @xmath21 ( although existing in in@xmath1 at a rate @xmath22 3.5 mhz ) . because the lifetime of the @xmath11 state is so long",
    ", excitation of the @xmath12 - @xmath11 transition can not be detected directly via scattered fluorescence photons . instead , _",
    "excitation of the @xmath11 state _ is determined via _ an interruption of fluorescence photons _ on the fast @xmath12 - @xmath10 transition @xcite .",
    "the response of the system when tuning the laser @xmath16 over the @xmath12 - @xmath11 resonance is thus probed by the amount of fluorescence photons scattered on the @xmath12 - @xmath10 - transition . in this aspect ,",
    "the way of determining the _ induced coherence significantly differs _ from ususal detection techniques employed in @xmath0 systems where fluorescence is recorded on the same transition over which the probing laser is scanned .",
    "we start the analysis from the master equation for the v - system :    @xmath23    here @xmath24 denotes the detuning between the laser and the atomic transition frequency for @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the linewidth of the clock laser .",
    "we include the linewidth of this laser as generally @xmath26 can be much bigger than @xmath27 . in steady state and for @xmath28",
    "the variation of @xmath29 with @xmath30 is ploted in fig .",
    "1 . for weak excitation of the @xmath12 - @xmath11 transition ,",
    "the excitation spectrum reveals two separated , well resolved peaks ( fig . 1b ) . for these parameters , the weak beam acts as a probe which explores the distribution of population among the dressed states of the pumping transition from a third `` spectator '' level .",
    "the observed absorption spectrum obtained by tuning the probe beam over the atomic resonance leads thus to a double - peaked structure known as autler - townes splitting ( ats ) @xcite .",
    "if the power of laser @xmath16 is increased the spectrum changes its form , to the one shown in fig .",
    "1c . in the limiting case where both lasers are strongly saturating the @xmath12 - @xmath10 - and @xmath12 - @xmath11 - transitions there appears within the broad resonance a sharp peak where @xmath29 increases almost to its initial value ( obtained if laser @xmath16 is absent or strongly detuned )",
    "when @xmath31 both lasers are in resonance , then a coherence between levels @xmath10 and @xmath11 is established by the presence of the clock laser which increases the emission of fluorescence photons on transition @xmath12 - @xmath10 and suppresses the absorption of laser @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "it has been demonstrated previously that the strong pumping on the metastable transition could lead to stabilization of quantum fluctuations in the fluorescence spectrum @xcite .",
    "note that the increased fluorescence which appears in the center of an autler - townes splitting ( case shown in fig .",
    "1b ) can be clearly distinguished from the increase of fluorescence in case of the clock laser induced coherence ( cic ) between levels @xmath10 and @xmath11 ( fig .",
    "in case of ats with zero detuning , @xmath28 , the excitation spectrum is given by two lorentzians with equal width but blue- and red - shifted by an equal amount from the pump laser frequency @xmath15 . in case of cic",
    "the excitation spectrum lineshape follows two lorentzians of different widths and opposite amplitudes located at the same position @xmath31 .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to investigate the behaviour of the system in these two limiting cases , and , in particular , to study the transition from one regime into the other .",
    "it will be shown that there exist well - defined conditions in which either one or the other behaviour is displayed .",
    "a sharp border line separates the two regimes .",
    "this border is determined by a single control parameter given by the ratio @xmath32 of the two rabi - frequencies .",
    "this ratio determines via the common lower level the laser induced degree of coherence between the two upper states .",
    "in this section we assume that laser @xmath15 is in resonance with the @xmath12 - @xmath10 transition , i.e. @xmath33 . in what follows",
    "we employ the steady state solutions of the master equation and make use of the particular level scheme of in@xmath1 . here , the two upper states of the three - level system have very different lifetimes , with a ratio of the order of @xmath34 .",
    "this means , we have :    @xmath35    assuming further that we use for the excitation of transition @xmath12 - @xmath11 a laser which is spectrally broader than @xmath27 , say with a width @xmath26 , we still will have :    @xmath36    thus - even for strong saturation of the clock - transition @xmath12 - @xmath11 - we will work in the limit :    @xmath37    under these conditions the steady state solutions of the master equation can be considerably simplified so that a clear understanding of the cic is obtained . using ( [ limit ] ) , we have proved that the expression for the population in the excited state @xmath10 can be reduced to :    @xmath38    where the @xmath39 are given by    @xmath40    with    @xmath41    and    @xmath42    note that expression ( [ rho11 ] ) is independent of the laser linewidth @xmath26 .",
    "this is a consequence of the limit ( [ limit ] ) : terms in @xmath26 appearing in sums with @xmath17 , @xmath43 are neglected in the derivation of ( [ rho11 ] ) .",
    "this means that a frequency - unstable clock laser does not deform the lineshapes predicted by eq .",
    "( [ rho11 ] ) .",
    "since @xmath44 is real for arbitrary @xmath17 , @xmath18 , one can see from eq .",
    "( [ rho11 ] ) and ( [ lambda ] ) that the bahaviour of the system depends critically on the value of @xmath45 .",
    "if @xmath45 is purely imaginary , we have :    @xmath46    that is :    @xmath47    so that :    @xmath48 \\cdot [ ( \\delta_{2 } + \\lambda_0 ) ^2 + \\gamma_0 ^ 2 ] } \\right)\\ ] ]    thus , for purely imaginary values of @xmath45 , the excitation spectrum of the @xmath12 - @xmath10 transition as a function of @xmath30 is described by two lorentzians with equal widths , positioned at @xmath49 .",
    "we here recover the well known autler - townes doublet . in the limit ( [ limit ] )",
    ", the approximate position of the resonances is found to be :    @xmath50    note the dependence of ( [ posats ] ) on the power of the clock laser .",
    "we next consider the possibility of @xmath45 being real . in this",
    "case calculations show that the following relation holds :    @xmath51    we therefore have :    @xmath52    @xmath53    in this case ( [ rho11 ] ) can be written as :    @xmath54    we again find two lorentzians in the spectrum , however located at line center @xmath31 .",
    "the two peaks have now different widths , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .    the real and imaginary parts of @xmath57 are plotted as a function of @xmath18 in fig .",
    "as can be seen from the plots , there exists a critical value @xmath58 above which the real part of @xmath57 vanishes and the imaginary parts start to differ .",
    "below @xmath58 the reverse is true , i.e. the position of the resonances differ ( equal in modulus but different in sign ) and the linewidths become degenerate .",
    "a clear borderline separates the two regimes - determined by the condition @xmath59 - which can be deduced from ( 13 ) to be :    @xmath60    the dependence of @xmath58 on @xmath17 is plotted in fig .",
    "3 . as can be seen from ( [ border ] )",
    ", the border critically depends on both , saturation @xmath61 and the ratio of the natural linewidths of the two upper states , @xmath62 . for strong saturation @xmath63 the dependence ( [ border ] ) simplifies to a linear one :    @xmath64    note that the position of the cic resonance corresponds precisely to the line center of the broader lorentzian curve .",
    "the two lorentzians are thus superposed at the same detuning ( at @xmath31 ) but have opposite signs . to see this more clearly another expression for @xmath29",
    "can be derived which lends itself to describe in a more transparent way the behaviour of the system for @xmath65 .",
    "it is obtained by first taking the limit @xmath66 ( well suited for the cic regime where @xmath18 is supposed to be much larger than @xmath27 ) and then adding the remaining part of eq .",
    "( [ rho11 ] ) to the expression thus obtained .",
    "in this way one obtains :    @xmath67    the first term in ( [ rho11c ] ) is the fluorescence produced by the system if the clock laser were absent .",
    "it also gives the value of @xmath29 in the limit of very large detuning @xmath30 .",
    "the next two terms in ( [ rho11c ] ) are produced by a strong clock laser , although in the limit ( [ limit ] ) the second term does not depend explicitly on the clock laser intensity .",
    "the width of this term is determined not only by the width of the transition @xmath12 - @xmath10 but also by the power of the laser on that transition .",
    "looking at the last term in ( [ rho11c ] ) we see that it becomes more and more broadened as we increase the intensity of the clock laser .",
    "moreover , its width is determined by the natural linewidth of state @xmath11 . for large @xmath68 ,",
    "the ratio of the widths of the last two terms in ( [ rho11c ] ) is approximately equal to :    @xmath69    the reduction in fluorescence on the @xmath12 - @xmath10 transition described by the third term in ( [ rho11c ] ) can be understood by the increase in population transfer to the @xmath11 state as the intensity of the clock laser is pumped up .",
    "therefore , clearly , the positive lorentzian ( second term in ( [ rho11c ] ) ) has to be a coherence contribution @xcite . to demonstrate this",
    "the behaviour of the coherence @xmath70 as a function of @xmath30 is plotted in this regime in fig .",
    "for the case of off - resonant pump , @xmath71 , again analytical results can be obtained by solving the master equation .",
    "these , however , are cumbersome and hence only numerical results are presented .",
    "the overall behaviour of fluorescence on the fast transition in the two limiting cases @xmath72 and @xmath65 for @xmath71 is displayed in fig .",
    "5 . for @xmath72 ,",
    "the two peaks of the ats regime can be identified , being asymmetric in this case ( fig .",
    "5a ) . if @xmath65 the cic regime is entered .",
    "the cic resonance is now shifted away from the atomic transition within the broad resonance of reduced fluorescence which stays approximately constant in frequency space ( fig .",
    "5b ) . in order to understand this behaviour",
    ", we have to examine the poles of @xmath29 as a function of @xmath30 .",
    "let us denote the complex zeros of the denominator in @xmath29 by @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "we show in fig .",
    "6 the real and imaginary parts of @xmath39 , i = 1,2 , as a function of @xmath75 in the two limiting cases of @xmath72 and @xmath65 . as can be seen in fig .",
    "6a , asymmetries appear in the spectra in case of ats . for @xmath71 ,",
    "the two resonances are shifted by an unequal amount towards ( away ) from the atomic resonance and the linewidths and amplitudes start to differ ( see fig .",
    "5a ) : the peak moving towards the atomic resonance decreases in width and increases in amplitude where the opposite is true for the second peak .    in case of @xmath65",
    "the cic resonance is blue - shifted for @xmath76 and red - shifted for @xmath77 ( see fig .",
    "in contrast , the broad lorentzian is not shifted much .",
    "it stays approximately constant in frequency space but rapidly reduces its width for increased detuning @xmath75 .",
    "in conclusion we investigated the response of a v - system with very different lifetimes of the two upper states when continously pumped on the fast transition and exposed to a laser of varying intensity on the slow transition .",
    "two different regimes were discerned as a function of clock laser power in which the system behaves in fundamentally different ways . in the ats",
    "regime the clock laser serves as a probe which senses the population of the light shifted dressed states of the fast transition .",
    "this leads to the well known double peak structure of the autler - townes splitting and corresponds to the pump - probe regime .",
    "in contrast , in the cic regime , the clock laser , apart from transferring population to the @xmath11 state , induces at the 2-photon resonance a coherence which suppresses the absorption of the clock laser and increases the emission of fluorescence photons on the fast transition . for @xmath33 ,",
    "transparent analytical formulas are obtained which describe in simple terms the lineshape , position and widths of the corresponding resonances . moreover , a sharp borderline has been derived which accurately separates the two regimes .",
    "this borderline relates the two laser intensities and depends only on the saturation of the fast transition and the ratio of the two lifetimes involved . in case of strong saturation of the fast transition ,",
    "a simple linear dependence is obtained ( eq . [ bordersimple ] ) .",
    "thus , for a given cooling laser intensity , the observed regime can be immediately derived from the clock laser intensity . presently , in our lab , experiments are under way to investigate this behaviour in a single trapped in@xmath78 ion @xcite",
    ". the lifetime ratio of the two upper states of @xmath7 in combination with the recently improved clock laser power @xcite makes in@xmath1 an attractive candidate for such kinds of experiments .",
