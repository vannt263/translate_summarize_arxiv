    "rather than showing the time dependence of two particles interacting with each other , quantum mechanics textbooks often present a time - independent view of a single particle interacting with an external potential . in part , this makes the physics clearer , and in part , this reflects the difficulty of solving the time - independent two - particle schrdinger equation for the motion of wavepackets . in the classic quantum mechanics text by schiff @xcite , examples of realistic quantum scattering , such as that in fig .",
    "[ schiff1 ] , are produced by computer simulations of wave packets colliding with square potential barriers and wells .",
    "generations of students have carried memories of these images ( or of the film loops containing these frames @xcite ) as to what realistic quantum scattering looks like .",
    "[ schiff1 ]     while fig .",
    "[ schiff1 ] is a good visualization of a quantum scattering processes , we wish to extend simulations of realistic quantum interactions to include particle  particle scattering when both particles are represented by wavepackets .",
    "although more complicated , this , presumably , is closer to nature and may illustrate some physics not usually found in quantum mechanics textbooks . in addition , our extension goes beyond the treatment found in most computational physics texts which concentrate on _ one - particle _",
    "wavepackets @xcite , or highly restricted forms of _ two - particle _ wavepackets @xcite .",
    "the simulations of the time - dependent schrdinger equation shown by schiff were based on the 1967 finite - difference algorithms developed by goldberg _",
    "_ @xcite . those simulations , while revealing , had problems with stability and probability conservation .",
    "a decade later , cakmak and askar @xcite solved the stability problem by using a better approximation for the time derivative .",
    "after yet another decade , visscher @xcite solved the probability conservation problem by solving for the real and imaginary parts of the wave function at slightly different ( `` staggered '' ) times .    in this paper",
    "we combine the advances of the last 20 years and extend them to the numerical solution of the _ two particle_in contrast to the _ one particle _ time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "other than being independent of spin , no assumptions are made regarding the functional form of the interaction or initial conditions , and , in particular , there is no requirement of separation into relative and center - of - mass variables@xcite .",
    "the method is simple , explicit , robust , easy to modify , memory preserving , and may have research applications .",
    "however , high precision does require small time and space steps , and , consequently , long running times .",
    "a similar approach for the time - dependent one - particle schrdinger equation in a two - dimensional space has also been studied @xcite .",
    "we solve the two - particle time - dependent schrdinger equation @xmath0 where , for simplicity , we assume a one - dimensional space and set @xmath1 . here",
    "@xmath2 is the hamiltonian operator and @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mass and position of particle @xmath5 .",
    "knowledge of the two - particle wave function @xmath6 permits the calculation of the probability density for particle 1 being at @xmath7 and particle 2 being at @xmath8 at time @xmath9 : @xmath10 the fact that particles 1 and 2 must be located someplace in space leads to the normalization constraint on the wave function : @xmath11     as a function of the particle positions @xmath7 and @xmath8 , for a repulsive @xmath1210@xmath12 collision in which the mean kinetic energy equals twice the barrier height .",
    "the numbers in the left hand corners give the times in units of @xmath13.[rho ] ]    the description of a single particle within a multi - particle system by a single - particle wave function is an approximation unless the system is uncorrelated ( in which case the total wave function can be written in product form ) .",
    "however , it is possible to deduce meaningful one - particle densities from the two - particle density by integrating over the other particle : @xmath14 here we use a subscript on the single - particle density @xmath15 to distinguish it from the two - particle density @xmath16 .",
    "of course , the true solution is @xmath6 , but we find it hard to see the physics in a three - variable complex function , and so , often , view @xmath17 and @xmath18 as two separate wavepackets colliding .",
    "if particles 1 and 2 are identical , then their total wave function should be symmetric or antisymmetric under interchange of the particles .",

    "we solve the two - particle schrdinger equation ( [ hpsi ] ) via a finite difference method that converts the partial differential equation into a set of simultaneous , algebraic equations .",
    "first , we evaluate the dependent variable @xmath21 on a grid of discrete values for the independent variables @xcite : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath12 , and @xmath24 are integers .",
    "the space part of the algorithm is based on taylor expansions of @xmath6 in _ both _ the @xmath7 and @xmath8 variables up to @xmath25 ; for example , @xmath26 in discrete notation , the rhs of the schrdinger equation ( [ hpsi ] ) now becomes : @xmath27 next , we express the time derivative in ( [ hpsi ] ) in terms of finite time differences by taking the formal solution to the time - dependent schrdinger equation and making a forward - difference approximation for time evolution operator : @xmath28 although simple , this approximation scheme is unstable since the term multiplying @xmath21 has eigenvalue @xmath29 and modulus @xmath30 , and this means the modulus of the wave function increases with each time step @xcite .",

    "explicit _ solution in which the wave function at only two past time values must be stored simultaneously in memory to determine all future times by continued iteration .",
    "in contrast , an _ implicit _ solution determines the wave function for all future times in just one step , yet this one step requires the solution of simultaneous algebraic equations involving all space and time values .",
    "accordingly , an implicit solution requires the inversion of exceedingly large @xmath34 ) matrices .    while the explicit method ( [ algor ] ) produces a solution which is stable and second - order accurate in time , in practice , it does not conserve probability well .",

    "this time there is an attractive interaction between the particles and again the mean energy equals half the well depth .",

    "the initial packets are seen to slow down as they approach each other , with their mutual repulsion narrowing and raising the packets up until the time ( 50 ) when they begin to bounce back .",
    "the wavepackets at still later times are seen to retain their shape , with a progressive broadening until they collide with the walls and break up .",
    "as shown on the web , when the mean energy is raised there will be both transmitted and reflected wave , already seen in fig .",

    "[ antisymm ] we repeat the collision of fig .  [ mmsq5 ] , only now for a wave function that has been _ antisymmetrized _ according to ( [ symm ] ) .",
    "the anitsymmetrization is seen to introduce an effective repulsion into what is otherwise an attraction ( compare the two figures for times 6066 ) . again , some capture of the other wavepacket is noted from times 94 on , only now the internal captured wavepacket retains its gaussian - like shape , apparently the result of decreased interference .",

    "the symmetrization is seen to introduce an effective added attraction ( compare the three figures for time 60 which shows the greatest penetration for the symmetrized case ) .",
    "while there is still capture of the other wavepacket , the movie gives the clear impression that the wavepackets interchange with each other as a consequence of the symmetrization .",
    "we have assembled and tested a general technique for the numerical solution of the two - particle , time - dependent schrdinger equation .",
    "because the technique is general , application to two or three dimensions and for other potentials and initial conditions should be straightforward .",
    "for example , further studies may want to investigate initial conditions corresponding to bound particles interacting with a surface , or the formation of a molecule near a surface .",
    "the goldberg - schiff s image ( fig .  [ schiff1 ] ) of a wavepacket interacting with a potential barrier is still a valuable model for understanding the physics occuring during a particle s collision .",
    "here we have extended the level of realism to what a collision between two particles looks like . in doing so with a simple square - well potential between the two particles , we have discovered that fission and particle pickup occur quite often , although the physics may be quite different from that in nuclei . while somewhat of a challenge to understand fully , we have also provided animations of the behavior of the two - particle density during collisions .",
    "we have placed the animations , source codes , and movie - making instructions on the web with the hope that future students will also carry some of these images of the quantum world with them .",
