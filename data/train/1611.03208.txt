    "the motivation to study such potentials actually came from 1 + 1 dimensional quantum field theories with four - fermion interaction ( gross - neveu ( gn ) @xcite and nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl@xmath11 ) @xcite models ) , as well as from the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation for quasi one - dimensional superconductors @xcite . here , transparent potentials emerge dynamically as mean fields in a semi - classical approximation to interacting fermion theories .",
    "they exhibit a variety of static solitons and non - static breathers , as well as bound states and time dependent scattering processes thereof @xcite .",
    "the elementary building block of all of these solutions is the twisted kink carrying a topological charge , originally introduced by shei in the large @xmath0 limit of the njl@xmath11 model @xcite .",
    "these solitons are populated by fermions , but otherwise behave exactly as expected for integrable bosonic systems : forward scattering only , purely elastic scattering and factorization of the transmission amplitude into two - soliton transmission amplitudes .",
    "the fact that the bosons are composite rather than elementary does not affect any of these properties .",
    "a question which has only been answered partially so far is the following : do these transparent potentials satisfy one or several non - linear partial differential equations ( pde s ) , which would allow one to relate the fermionic models to classical bosonic field theories ?",
    "the only case where this has been understood is dynamics of real kinks in the gn model ( @xmath12 , twist angle @xmath13 only , kink interpolating between the vacua @xmath14 to @xmath15 in natural units ) @xcite .",
    "this problem is much easier , since the fermion bound states do not react back onto the potential , and real kinks form neither bound states nor breathers .",
    "it has been shown that kink dynamics ( restricting twists to the value @xmath13 ) in the large @xmath0 limit can be mapped onto the classical @xmath16 gn model , for which neveu and papanicolaou have proven long ago @xcite that @xmath17 satisfies the sinh - gordon equation , @xmath18 the lax pair used to prove integrability is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 in a certain gauge ( @xmath21 is a spectral parameter , cf .",

    "unlike neveu and papanicolaou , we have not yet succeeded in deriving the pde s directly from a fermionic field theory .",
    "we rather start from the solution for transparent potentials @xmath29 and try to find pde s which they satisfy .",
    "this has turned out to be less straightforward than it may sound .",

    "<S> transparent scalar and pseudoscalar potentials in the one - dimensional dirac equation play an important role as self - consistent mean fields in 1 + 1 dimensional four - fermion theories ( gross - neveu , nambu  jona lasinio models ) and quasi - one dimensional superconductors ( bogoliubov - de gennes equation ) . here , we show that they also serve as seed to generate a large class of classical multi - soliton and multi - breather solutions of su(@xmath0 ) affine toda field theories , including the lax representation and the corresponding vector . </S>",
    "<S> this generalizes previous findings about the relationship between real kinks in the gross - neveu model and classical solitons of the sinh - gordon equation to complex twisted kinks . </S>"
