    "in recent years , ads / cft correspondence opens up new ways to investigate low temperature dynamics of strongly correlated electron systems @xcite .",
    "the physics of condensed matter system ( cm ) is very diverse , thus we need to find various theoretical models and to classify them in terms of its universality classes at low temperature .",
    "classification criteria may include the appropriate phases via their thermodynamic properties including phase transitions and their transport coefficients , which is directly connected to what is measured by experiments .",
    "one of the first and comprehensively investigated example of such classes is charged reissner - nordstrm ( rn ) black holes of einstein - maxwell gravity with a cosmological constant .",
    "such solutions proved to be the simplest laboratory for the study of phase transitions at finite density @xcite , fermionic quasi - particles with non - fermi liquid behavior @xcite , as well as an emerging scaling symmetry at zero temperature @xcite , and superfluid ( superconductivity ) phase transitions @xcite .",
    "while this model acquired interesting and important developments , it has a large entropy at extremailty signaling instability .",
    "anticipating cm application , it is desirable to find many more models , which have qualitatively distinct features with each other .",
    "a family of charged black hole solutions with one parameter to the low energy string theory with dilaton has interesting and several distinctive thermodynamic properties @xcite : the maxwell field ( @xmath2 ) in the solution has a generalized coupling with the dilaton ( @xmath3 ) as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is a parameter . when @xmath6 , it is nothing but the rn black hole , which has vanishing extremal temperature @xmath7 and finite entropy @xmath8 at extremality .",
    "the extremal behavior of the solution changes according to the parameter @xmath5 : the extremal entropy vanishes for non - zero @xmath5 , while the extremal temperature changes as @xmath7 for @xmath9 , @xmath10 for @xmath11 and @xmath12 for @xmath13 .",
    "thus it is natural to expect that we can generate several qualitatively distinct classes with a dilaton potential and a coupling constant to the maxwell field with a scalar dilation .",
    "we would like to model strongly - coupled holographic systems at finite charge density by including a leading relevant scalar operator , which is generically uncharged and drives the renormalization group flow of the system from uv to ir .",
    "the corresponding holographic theory is an einstein - maxwell - dilaton system with a scalar potential . in the case of zero charge density such theories have been analyzed ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) and generalized to the finite charge density case ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) .",
    "this is a phenomenological approach based on the concept of effective holographic theory ( eht ) , in analogy with effective field theories which is low energy approximations to qft .",
    "it allows a parametrization of large classes of ir dynamics and a survey of important observables , while it is not obvious if concrete ehts can be embedded in well - defined string theories , or if classical singular solutions are acceptable as saddle points of the dual cfts @xcite .",
    "our strategy is to select a minimal set of operators ( or dual string fields ) that are expected to dominate the low energy dynamics and then parametrize their eht in terms of a general two - derivative action .",
    "this set is composed of the bulk metric , @xmath14 , controlling the energy distribution , bulk gauge field , @xmath15 , associated with a conserved u(1 ) current @xmath16 and a scalar leading - relevant operator , @xmath3 , controlling the coupling constant and its running in the ir . for a cm system , @xmath3 may represent the strong interactions of the ion lattice or the effect of spins on the charge carriers .",
    "if the charge carriers are dilute , we expect that the dynamics can be treated in the probe approximation , while the full set of equations must be solved at sufficiently large doping .    at the two - derivative level ,",
    "the eht in the maxwell case is described in the einstein frame by the action s= m^p-1d^p+1x - m^p-1d^p+1xf_f^ [ actionliouville]indeed , the most general , @xmath17 dimensional , two - derivative action containing a metric , a vector and a single scalar can be brought to this form via field redefinitions . on the other hand ,",
    "the linear maxwell action , @xmath18 , must be replaced by the dbi action @xmath19 @xmath20 in the fundamental charge case . here",
    "@xmath21 is the einstein frame metric .",
    "@xmath22 has been normalized such that the dbi action reduces to the maxwell one for @xmath23 .",
    "the parameter @xmath24 encodes the dilatonic nature of the scalar field @xmath3 . if @xmath3 is the dilaton , @xmath25 .",
    "even though the discussions can be generalized to other dimensions straightforwardly , we would like to concentrate on the 4 dimensional case , targeting ( 2 + 1)-dimensional cm phenomena .    while , in holographic theories , it is standard to assume that there is a non - trivial fixed point in the uv to ensure a globally controllable behavior with an appropriate uv boundary , this assumption is not necessary if our only interest is to understand the infrared ( ir ) dynamics .",
    "for example , the non - trivial dynamical condition , which defines the  vacuum \" and expectation values , is imposed in the ir typically by a regularity condition in the far ir .",
    "for this purpose and also motivated by controlled examples , we model @xmath26 as generic scalar operators have non - trivial n - point functions in all realistic examples .",
    "we further demand that @xmath27 in the uv to guarantee that simple modifications of the potential like @xmath28 will lead to asymptotically ads solutions without modification of the ir behavior .",
    "we also model @xmath29 motivated from both gauge supergravity actions stemming from string theory as shown in the introduction .    with this eht setup , we generically encounter naked singularities deep in ir .",
    "thus we investigate the consistency condition of our eht model in ir with the following listed criteria and constrained the parameter space @xmath30 , which is depicted in fig.[constraint ] :    * gubser s criteria : _ a naked singularity is unphysical if the scalar potential is not bounded below when evaluated in the solution_@xcite . in holography ,",
    "well - defined and controllable perturbations of n=4 sym lead to mild naked singularities in the bulk , which are generically resolved by lifting to higher dimensions or eventually by the inclusion of the stringy states .",
    "thus not all naked singularities are unacceptable . *",
    "well - defined spectrum : _ a naked singularity describes unreliable holographic physics if the second - order equations describing the spectrum of small fluctuations around the solution are not well - defined sturm - liouville problems_@xcite .",
    "we change our low energy fluctuation equations into schrdinger form and require our solutions to have only one normalizable mode in the deep ir for spin 1 and spin 2 spectra .",
    "this also allows us to classify the nature of low energy spectrum , which is discussed when we discuss the transport properties . * thermodynamic stability",

    "a direct calculation can be done by turning on a constant electric field , calculating the induced current and thus obtaining the ratio @xcite using the probe dbi action which describes massless , self - interacting but non - backreacting charge carriers .",
    "we also summarize the low energy spectrum of our models , which was analyzed fully in @xcite .    we will in turn consider four different classes of solutions : uncharged , near extremal , exact solution with @xmath36 and with @xmath37 .",

    "when @xmath41 or @xmath42 and the uv dimension of the scalar @xmath43 , the schrdinger potential diverges both in the uv and the ir . thus the spectrum is discrete and gaped , which resembles to an insulator .",

    "+ at the lowest densities the dc conductivity shows @xmath49 in particular , in this dilute regime it is independent of the dilatonic nature of the scalar field , which can be parametrized by a parameter @xmath24 .",
    "thus the conductivity can be linear in temperature @xmath50 for @xmath51 which is universal for unconventional superconductor at the optimal doping @xcite .",
    "this dc resistivity has an interesting relation with entropy and heat capacity in temperature @xmath50 @xmath52 as the zero charge density system never exhibits an entropy linear in temperature , we conclude that when linear resistivity appears , it is due to the presence of charge carriers . for higher charge density , @xmath53 where @xmath54 is charge density . in this case , the resistivity can never be linear .",
    "* near extremal solution : we view this solution as near extremal limit of full general solutions of the action ( [ actionliouville ] ) with two parameters @xmath30 describing our effective holographic theory deep in ir .",
    "these are the near extremal approximations to the two exact solutions with @xmath55 and @xmath33 .",
    "it contains the lifshitz solution as a special case with @xmath56 and @xmath57 @xcite .",

    "it turns out that @xmath61 is positive for the regions where the solutions is thermodynamically stable and completable to ads space . if @xmath62 , which is equivalent to have vanishing schrdinger potential in ir , the spectrum of charged fluctuation is gapless and continuous , describing a conductor .",
    "if @xmath63 and @xmath64 with the assumption to have ads boundary and @xmath65 there , scalar potential diverges both at uv and ir .",

    "dc conductivity , on the other hand , @xmath67 with @xmath68 .",

    "+ the leading scaling behavior of thermodynamic functions and conductivities is expected to be universal and be valid for all solutions for this class of theories near extremality .",

    "the schrdinger potential diverges near the horizon at extremality , and hence the system is insulating , while it becomes conducting away from extremality ( see fig.[fig : gd1vsupper ] ) . for @xmath79 , the system is conducting with a continuum of states at extremality .",

    "it is worthwhile to mention recent attempts , using holographic finite density systems , to describe the benchmark conductivity features of unconventional superconductors : a linear temperature dependence of resistivity , @xmath88 , at the optimal doping , its crossover to @xmath89 in the over - doped region , and a quadratic temperature dependence of inverse hall angle , @xmath90 .",
    "the linear temperature dependence of the ohmic resistivity was found in spaces with ads or lifshitz scaling @xcite , as well as schrdinger space with special conditions @xcite .",
    "a linear resistivity and a crossover to quadratic was found in a larger class of scaling geometries in @xcite .",
    "the hall angle behavior was recently discussed using lifshitz type metric with broken rotational symmetry @xcite .",
    "finally these all three benchmark behaviors including a crossover were reproduced in a single holographic system in @xcite .",
    "we discuss a set of effective holographic theories parametrized by two exponents @xmath0 associated with dilatonic coupling to the gauge fields and potential .",
    "the parameter space is severely constrained by the nature of the ir singularity . imposing constraints for the singularity to be",
    "a good kind removes part of the @xmath0 plane as discussed .",
    "the transport properties of the allowed parameter space are studied and characterized by their scaling behavior .",
    "they suggest that there are ehts that display the hallmark behavior of general strange metals , namely linear resistivity .",
    "moreover , the dc resistivity is correlated to the entropy and the specific heat .",
    "there are however more features of the physics of the ehts that need to be analyzed so that their suitability as theories of strange metal behavior can be assessed .",
    "an important general ingredient are the zero and low temperature spectra of fluctuations , that should be derived in order to completely characterize the low energy degrees of freedom , as well as the energy - energy and charge - charge correlators .",
    "in particular the interplay between insulating versus conducting behavior must be further analyzed .",
    "it is a generic property of the holographic systems described here , in the @xmath91dimensional case , to favor conducting behavior .",
    "indeed , with the exception of strongly relevant dynamics , the systems at small charge density seem to be conductors at any small but non - zero temperature .",
    "there is generically a continuous phase transition to the extremal solution which is insulating .",
    "the phase structure also seems to be interestingly varying with the ir  strength \" of the scalar operator captured by the exponent @xmath38 .",
    "there are indications from our analysis that the appearance of discrete spectra at low temperature is  delayed \" by the finite charge density . at zero charge density ,",
    "such spectra appear when @xmath92 while at finite density in the @xmath93 case they never appear , and for @xmath94 their appearance is delayed until @xmath95 .",
