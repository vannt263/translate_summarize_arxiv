    "entanglement between two distant locations is an essential resource for quantum information and communication @xcite .",
    "many quantum information processes can not be realized perfectly without maximally entangled states .",
    "for instance , quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum dense coding @xcite , and quantum - state sharing @xcite require entangled states to set up a quantum channel between alice and bob , the two parties in quantum communication . also , alice and bob can exploit entangled photon pairs to create a private key efficiently @xcite , in particular in long - distance quantum communication with quantum repeater @xcite .",
    "as photons are the best physical systems for long - distance transmission of quantum states , people always choose their entangled states in the polarization degree of freedom to fulfill these tasks discussed previously .",
    "however , during a practical transmission , the polarization degree of freedom of photons is incident to be influenced by the thermal fluctuation , vibration , and the imperfection of an optical fiber .",
    "that is , they suffer from the channel noise inevitably whether they are single photons or entangled photon pairs .",
    "thus , various error correction and error - rejection processes are proposed .",
    "for example , with decoherent - free subspaces , walton _",
    "@xcite proposed a scheme for rejecting the errors introduced by a collective noise .",
    "quantum redundancy - code is also introduced to solve this problem @xcite .",
    "for the faithful transmission of a single - photon polarization state over a collective - noise channel , yamamoto et al .",
    "@xcite proposed an error - rejecting scheme with an additional single photon in 2005 .",
    "the success probability is in principle 1/16 without two - qubit operations .",
    "subsequently , kalamidas @xcite proposed two schemes to reject and correct arbitrary qubit errors without additional particles , but fast polarization modulators . in 2007 , li et al .",
    "@xcite also proposed a faithful qubit transmission scheme against a collective noise without ancillary qubits .",
    "its success probability is 50% with only linear optical elements in a passive way .",
    "also , they presented another faithful single - qubit transmission scheme with a success probability of 50% based on the frequency degree of freedom of photons , resorting to an additional qubit @xcite .",
    "for entangled quantum systems , there is another kind of processes which can be used to decrease the influence arising from the noise , named entanglement purification . for purifying a werner state @xcite , bennett _",
    "@xcite proposed an original entanglement purification protocol ( epp ) based on quantum controlled - not ( cnot ) gates in 1996 .",
    "subsequently , several epps based on similar quantum logic operations have been introduced . at present , a perfect cnot gate based on linear optical elements is very difficult to implement experimentally with current technology . in 2001 , pan _",
    "@xcite proposed an epp based on linear optics , without resorting to cnot gates , which is feasible in experiment .",
    "we also proposed an epp based on cross - kerr nonlinearity @xcite .",
    "however , entanglement purification is essentially used to distill some high - fidelity entangled states from less - entangled ones by sacrificing several qubits . in other words , all conventional epps @xcite can not get perfect maximally entangled photon pairs by far as they work probabilistically in principle . thus , the faithful distribution of maximally pure entangled states between two distant locations is valuable for the realization of long - distance quantum communication .",
    "the polarization entanglement of photon pairs is easily disturbed by the noise in quantum channel , so it is not a good way to transmit the polarization entanglement of photons directly over a noisy channel .",
    "there are some other degrees of freedom of photons , which suffer little from the channel noise over an optical fiber , such as the spatial degree of freedom and the frequency degree of freedom of photons . with present technology ,",
    "the entanglement of photons in the frequency degree of freedom is not difficult to be prepared with spontaneous parametric down - conversion @xcite .",
    "when a light propagates through an optically nonlinear medium with second - order nonlinearity ( @xmath0 ) , we can produce a pair of photons in the `` idler '' and the `` signal '' modes . also the conservation in energy and momentum",
    "can give rise to entanglement in various degrees of freedom , such as polarization entanglement , time - energy entanglement , and position - momentum entanglement .",
    "in this paper , we present an efficient entanglement distribution scheme over an arbitrary collective - noise channel .",
    "the basic idea of the present scheme is that the two parties , say alice and bob , first transmit an entangled state in the frequency degree of freedom which suffers little from the channel noise in an optical fiber .",
    "after alice and bob share an entangled photon pair , they add some operations and equipments to transfer the frequency entanglement of the photon pair into the polarization entanglement with a success probability of 100% .",
    "compared with conventional entanglement purification , this scheme does not require quantum resources largely .",
    "our protocol has several advantages .",
    "first , the noise channel can be an arbitrarily collective one .",
    "second , the two parties can get a perfect maximally entangled state in polarization in principle . in a practical transmission ,",
    "alice and bob can also obtain perfect maximally entangled states in polarization by controlling the distances between the entangled source and the users .",
    "moreover , this protocol can be generalized to distribute a multipartite entangled quantum system and can be easily realized in current experimental conditions .",
    "cross - kerr nonlinearity is a powerful tool for us to construct nondestructive quantum nondemoliton detectors ( qnd ) @xcite .",
    "the cross - kerr nonlinearity has been used to prepare cont gates @xcite and complete a local bell - state analysis @xcite .",
    "also it can be used to fulfill the quantum entanglement purification and entanglement concentration protocols @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of the cross - kerr nonlinearity is @xmath1 @xcite . here",
    "@xmath2 and @xmath3 are the creation operations and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the destruction operations .",
    "suppose a signal state @xmath6 ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 denote that there are no photon and one photon , respectively , in this state ) and a coherent probe beam in the state @xmath9 couple with a cross - kerr nonlinearity medium , the whole system evolves as @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the interaction time .",
    "the coherent beam picks up a phase shift @xmath13 directly proportional to the number of the photons in the fock state @xmath14 , which can be read out with a general homodyne - heterodyne measurement .",
    "so one can exactly check the number of photons in the fock state but not destroy them .",
    "now let us explain the principle of our entanglement distribution protocol over an arbitrary collective - noise channel .",
    "we suppose that the center , say carl prepares an entangled photon pair @xmath15 in the following state : @xmath16 here we denote the state of a horizontally polarized photon by @xmath17 and the state of a vertically polarized photon by @xmath18 .",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are two different frequency modes of the two photons .",

    ", alice and bob will get some different phase shifts and the photon pair will appear at some different output modes . in detail , if alice and bob have the same phase shift @xmath13 , the photon pair @xmath15 collapses to the state @xmath33 and they will appear at the lower output modes @xmath34 . if alice and bob have the same phase shift @xmath35 , the photon pair @xmath15 collapses to the state @xmath36 and they will appear at the upper output modes @xmath37 .",

    "the previous experiments showed that the polarization entanglement is quite unsuitable for transmission over distances of more than a few kilometers in an optical fiber @xcite .",
    "for example , naik _ et al .",
    "_ demonstrated the ekert protocol @xcite by only a few meters @xcite . also , they observed the quantum bit error rate ( qber ) increase to 33% in the experiment implementation of the six - state protocol @xcite . for frequency coding @xcite",
    ", for example , the besancon group performed a key distribution over a 20-km single - mode optical - fiber spool .",
    "they recorded a qber@xmath88 contribution of approximately 4% , and estimated that 2% could be attributed to the transmission of the central frequency by the fabry - perot cavity @xcite .",
    "that is , on one hand , the channel noise less affects the entanglement in the frequency degree of freedom . on the other hand , the optical fibers used to transmit photons will introduce a relative phase on the entanglement as there are two different frequencies in each photon .",
    "that is , the entangled state in the frequency degree of freedom will become @xmath89 after the two photons @xmath21 and @xmath22 are sent to alice and bob , respectively . here",
    "@xmath90 $ ] .",
    "@xmath91 and @xmath92 ( @xmath93 ) represent the velocity of photons in an optical fiber and the distance between the entangled source and alice ( bob ) , respectively . when @xmath94 , @xmath95 .",
    "that is , alice and bob can obtain a perfect entangled state in the frequency degree of freedom after their transmission if they can control their distances between them and the entangled source .",
    "also , alice and bob can compensate the relative phase @xmath96 after their transmission if @xmath97 , as @xmath96 is in general invariable and can be detected . in this case , the relative phase @xmath96 in frequency will be transferred into the entanglement in polarization .",
    "that is , alice and bob will obtain the maximally entangled state in the polarization degree of freedom with the form @xmath98 . with some unitary operations by wave plates ,",
    "they will obtain the standard bell state @xmath99 ) @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , kok _ et al .",
    "_ showed that operating in the optical single - photon regime , the kerr phase shift is only @xmath100 .",
    "with electromagnetically induced transparent materials , cross - kerr nonlinearities of @xmath101 can be obtained .",
    "the weak cross - kerr nonlinearity will make the phase shift @xmath13 and @xmath35 of the coherent state became extremely small , which will be hard to detect .",
    "that is to say , using homodyne detector , it is difficult to determine the phase shift due to the impossible discrimination of two overlapping coherent states , which will decrease the success probability of the present scheme to 1/4 at worst .",
    "in 2003 , hofmann _ et al .",

    "investigated quantum measurement strategies capable of discriminating two coherent states using a homodyne detector and a photon number resolving ( pnr ) detector @xcite . in order to lower the error probability ,",
    "the postselection strategy is applied to the measurement data of homodyne detector as well as a pnr detector .",
    "they indicated that the performance of the new displacement controlled pnr is better than homodyne receiver .    in summary",
    ", we have presented an efficient entanglement distribution scheme over an arbitrary collective - noise channel .",
    "compared with conventional entanglement purification protocols @xcite , the present scheme does not consume a great deal of less - entangled resources and it works in a determinate way .",
    "in essence , it is the entanglement transformation between two different degrees of freedom of photons .",
    "we exploit the feature that the frequency of photons suffers little from the channel noise to generate the entanglement in the polarization degree of freedom .",
    "if other degrees of freedom are robust to the channel noise , they also can be used to implement our protocol , and the frequency degree of freedom is not unique .",
