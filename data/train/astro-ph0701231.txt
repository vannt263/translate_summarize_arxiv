    "metallicity is one of the fundamental parameters to study the property of galaxy and its evolution history . the [ n  ii]/h@xmath3 strong emission - line ratio in the ionized gas in galaxies is a useful tracer to indicate the metallicities of the galaxies ( as n2=log([n  ii]/h@xmath3 ) ; pettini & pagel 2004 , pp04 ; yin et al .",

    "nitrogen is mainly synthesized in intermediate- and low - mass stars .",
    "the n2 index will therefore become stronger with ongoing star formation and galaxy evolution until reaching very high metallicities , i.e. 12+log(o / h)@xmath09.0 , where [ n ii ] starts to become weaker due to the very low electron temperature caused from strong cooling by metal ions .",
    "the n2 index is not affected very much by dust extinction due to the close wavelength positions of the two related lines .",
    "the near infrared spectroscopic instruments can gather these two lines for the galaxies with intermediate and high redshifts .",
    "the n2 index has helped to provide important information on the metallicities of galaxies at high-@xmath4 ( erb et al .",
    "however , the resulting log(o / h ) abundances from n2 ( and other methods including [ n ii ] line ) may involve the specific history of n - enrichment in the galaxies .",
    "we check this effect in more details in this paper .",
    "the mpa / jhu group used the photoionization models to simultaneously fit most prominent emission lines ( including [ n ii ] line ) , and then use the bayesian technique to calculate the likelihood distribution of the metallicity of each galaxy in the sdss database ( tremonti et al .",
    "2004 , t04 ) , given as ( o / h)@xmath5 in this study .",
    "we select 531 ( dr4 ) metal - poor and @xmath020,000 ( dr2 ) metal - rich galaxies from the sdss database for this study .",
    "we obtain their metallicities of ( o / h)@xmath6 and ( o / h)@xmath7 for the metal - poor sample galaxies ( y06a , b ) , and ( o / h)@xmath8 and ( o / h)@xmath9 for the metal - rich galaxies by using the calibrations given by pp04 and pilyugin & thuan ( 2005 , p05 ) , respectively .",
    "the metal - rich sample galaxies have 12+log(o / h)@xmath5@xmath108.5 and 12+log(o / h)@xmath9@xmath108.25 ( y06b ) .",
    "figs.1a - e show clearly the dependence of these abundances on log(n / o ) .    in summary , the strong - line ratio calibrations of metallicities involved [ n  ii ] emission - line may be related to the n - enrichment history of the galaxies , which should be kept in mind when compare the resulted abundances with others .",
