    "the kochen - specker ( ks ) theorem @xcite underlies a subtle but fundamental difference between classical and quantum theories .",
    "it shows that when describing systems with more than two distinguishable states , quantum theory , unlike its classical counterpart , is incompatible with the assumption of outcome noncontextuality .",
    "this means that there are quantum tests whose outcomes can not be predefined prior to the actual tests in a way that they do not depend on the test s context , that is , on the choice of jointly measurable tests which might be performed together .    a standard proof of the theorem relies on a construction of a so - called ks set of quantum yes - no tests .",
    "the tests of a ks set are represented by rank - one projectors ( or by the corresponding vectors ) , which are designed in a way making an assignment of the outcomes satisfying outcome noncontextuality impossible .",
    "more precisely , a _",
    "ks set _ in dimension @xmath0 is defined as a set @xmath1 of @xmath0-dimensional complex vectors , with @xmath2 and with the property that there is no map @xmath3 such that , for any context ( represented by an orthogonal basis in @xmath1 ) , one and only one of the vectors is mapped to  1 @xcite .    besides ks sets , there are two other ways of proving the ks theorem .",
    "one uses general operators instead of rank - one projectors @xcite .",
    "proofs of this type can be expressed in terms of ks sets @xcite . the other way is based on sets of vectors that permit one to derive a noncontextuality ( nc ) inequality violated by any quantum state @xcite .",
    "these sets of vectors are either ks sets or subsets of them ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) . in other words ,",
    "ks sets are behind all types of proofs of the ks theorem .",
    "the construction of ks sets is highly relevant for the foundations of physics , not only because ks sets provide a proof by contradiction of the incompatibility between quantum theory and non - contextual realism ( the ks theorem ) , but also because , assisted with maximally entangled states , ks sets provide a proof by contradiction of the incompatibility between quantum theory and local realism ( the so - called ks theorem with locality @xcite or free - will theorem @xcite ) .",
    "ks sets can also be used to design experimental tests to show the quantum state - independent violation of nc inequalities @xcite and to design experimental tests for detecting fully nonlocal correlations @xcite . in quantum information ,",
    "ks sets are used in quantum pseudotelepathy nonlocal games @xcite ; in games with quantum state - independent advantage @xcite , for providing security against classical attacks to quantum cryptographic protocols based on complementarity @xcite ; and for single - shot entanglement - assisted zero - error communication @xcite .",
    "the ks set in the original proof of the ks theorem @xcite contains @xmath4 vectors .",
    "this number is too high for a proof of such a fundamental result and also for practical applications .",
    "this motivated the search for more economical ks sets and simpler proofs of the ks theorem .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that the ks set with the smallest number of vectors has 18 vectors in @xmath5 .",
    "a set like that was introduced in ref .",
    "it has also been proven @xcite that the simplest proof of the ks theorem with a set of vectors which is not a ks set needs 13 vectors in @xmath6 . a proof like",
    "that was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it has been frequently pointed out @xcite that the above assessments of the proof s simplicity are not the most relevant , since the proofs of the ks theorem tacitly refer to many more vectors than those explicitly stated .",
    "this is so because the traditional way of counting vectors only takes into account those vectors that do not admit a ks valuation ( in the case of ks sets ) or that explicitly appear as variables in the state - independent nc inequality ( in the case of proofs with sets that are not ks sets ) . as remarked in ref .",
    "@xcite , `` [ t]his question of the actual size of a concrete ks set is important not so much for determining the record of the smallest such set , but for an experimental realisation , which actually involves procedures equivalent to basis . ''",
    "according to this observation , the physically relevant measure of simplicity of a proof of the ks theorem is the number of _ bases _ , which corresponds to the number of _ contexts _ in the ks set .    in this sense , the original proof of the ks theorem required 132 contexts in @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the ks sets in @xmath6 with the smallest number of vectors require 40 @xcite , 37 @xcite , and 36 contexts @xcite , respectively .",
    "the 13-vector proof of ref .",
    "@xcite requires 16 contexts .",
    "the ks set with the smallest number of vectors requires nine contexts @xcite .",
    "no other known proof requires a smaller number of contexts . significantly , these last two sets are , so far , the only ones that have been implemented in experiments @xcite .    a fundamental open question is , _ which is the proof of the ks theorem with the smallest number of bases ? _",
    "the aim of this article is to answer this question . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we show that there is a ks set requiring only seven bases in @xmath7 . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , we prove that , up to two natural assumptions , there is no ks set or proof of the ks theorem with yes - no tests requiring a smaller number of contexts .",
    "in addition , in sec .  [ sec4 ] , we use the ks set introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] to derive a nc inequality which is violated by any quantum state in @xmath7 .",
    "orthogonality relations between the vectors of the seven - context ks set .",
    "vectors are represented by nodes , and contexts ( bases ) are represented by straight lines .",
    "the pair of numbers @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , denotes the vector common to bases @xmath10 and @xmath11 in ( [ vi ] ) . ]",
    "consider the following 7 orthogonal bases in @xmath7 :    [ vi ] @xmath12    where @xmath13 .",
    "for simplicity , normalization factors are omitted .",
    "the seven bases in ( [ vi ] ) contain 21 different vectors .",
    "each vector belongs to two bases .",
    "the proof that the vectors in ( [ vi ] ) constitute a ks set is straightforward : to map one and only one of the vectors in each basis to @xmath14 , only seven vectors in ( [ vi ] ) must be mapped to @xmath14 .",
    "however , since each vector belongs to two bases , any mapping forces one to map to @xmath14 an _ even _ number of vectors .",
    "this makes the mapping impossible .",
    "the new ks set is represented in fig .",
    "the seven bases are represented by straight lines and each vector is represented as a node .",
    "the pair of numbers @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , denotes the vector common to bases @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "this seven - context 21-vector ks set does not only improve the current record of contexts in any @xmath0 @xcite and the current record of vectors in @xmath7 @xcite but , more importantly , as proven in the next section , constitutes the symmetric parity proof of the ks theorem ( defined later ) requiring the smallest number of contexts in any @xmath0 .",
    "any set of @xmath0-dimensional vectors can be associated to a graph @xmath15 in which vectors are represented by vertices such that two vertices in @xmath15 are adjacent if and only if the vectors that they represent are orthogonal .",
    "orthogonal bases then correspond to cliques of size @xmath0 in @xmath15 ( i.e. , sets of @xmath0 mutually adjacent vertices ) .",
    "a set of @xmath0-dimensional vectors allows for a proof of the ks theorem only if , in the corresponding @xmath15 , the minimum number of colors needed to color all vertices avoiding adjacent vertices to have the same color [ i.e. , the chromatic number of @xmath15 , @xmath16 is strictly greater than @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the ks set with the smallest number of bases previously known , namely the one in ref .",
    "@xcite , has two extra properties which make it particularly appealing : ( 1 ) its @xmath15 is vertex transitive , i.e. , given any two vertices @xmath17 and @xmath18 of the vertex set of @xmath15 , denoted as @xmath19 , there is some automorphism @xmath20 such that @xmath21 ; and ( 2 ) its @xmath15 has an odd number of cliques of size @xmath0 , while each vertex belongs exactly to an even number of them .",
    "any proof of the ks theorem having property ( 2 ) is called a _ parity proof , _ since the proof immediately follows from a simple parity argument .",
    "any proof of the ks theorem having properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is called a _ symmetric parity proof . _",
    "any ks set having properties ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) is called a _ symmetric parity ks set . _",
    "the first parity ks set was found by kernaghan @xcite and the first symmetric parity ks set is the one in ref .",
    "parity ks sets for systems of two , three , and four qubits have received special attention @xcite .",
    "our purpose is to prove that the ks set presented in the previous section is the symmetric parity proof of the ks theorem with the smallest number of contexts .",
    "the proof is as follows . for any parity ks set , the graph @xmath15 in which adjacent vertices represent orthogonal vectors is a fully contextual graph @xcite , namely , @xmath22 , where @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 are the independence number , lovsz number , and fractional packing number of @xmath15 , respectively ( for definitions , see appendix  [ appendix1 ] and refs .",
    "we generate _ all _ connected graphs with at most 31 vertices that are both fully contextual and vertex transitive ( see appendix  [ appendix2 ] for details ) . the number of graphs that are both fully contextual and vertex transitive are in column `` fcvt '' in table  [ table1 ] .",
    ".[table1]``fcvt '' indicates the number of fully contextual vertex - transitive connected graphs on @xmath26 vertices .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     if we add the restriction that the number of cliques of maximum size is odd and that every vertex belongs to an even number of them , then the number of graphs reduces substantially ( see column `` pfcvt '' in table  [ table1 ] )",
    ". only a few of them have nine or less bases .",
    "the first interesting graph , in boldface in table  [ table1 ] , is a ten - vertex graph called the johnson @xmath28 graph .",
    "it does not correspond to a ks set , since the maximum size of the cliques is 4 , while the graph does not admit a representation with vectors of @xmath5 , but requires vectors of dimension 6 @xcite ( see appendix  [ appendix3 ] for a proof ) .",
    "this graph also can not be used for a proof of the ks theorem without ks sets , since its chromatic number is  5 .",
    "the second interesting graph , in boldface in table  [ table1 ] , corresponds to the nine - basis 18-vector ks set in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "then we have five graphs corresponding to five - basis 20-vector sets .",

    "in addition , none of them can be used for a parity proof without ks sets , since the chromatic number of the common graph is  10 , while there is no representation of it in @xmath30 ( see appendix  [ appendix3 ] for a proof ) .",
