    "therefore , understanding the microscopic interactions between light and matter is an essential requirement to progress these emerging research areas into technological applications .",
    "when light arrives on a graphene sample it creates a highly non - equilibrium `` hot '' electron distribution ( he d ) , which first relaxes on an ultrafast timescale to a thermalized ( but still hot ) fermi - dirac ( fd ) distribution and then slowly cools , _ via _ optical and acoustic phonon emission , eventually reaching thermal equilibrium with the lattice .",
    "pump - probe spectroscopy is a very effective tool to study the non - equilibrium dynamics of hot carriers and has been extensively applied to a variety of graphene samples and other carbon - based materials  @xcite .",
    "there is consensus in the literature on the fact that the time scales of the thermalization process , primarily controlled by electron - electron ( e - e ) interactions , are extremely short , of the order of tens of femtoseconds .",
    "indeed , early theoretical calculations  @xcite based on the _ equilibrium _ many - body diagrammatic perturbation theory for an interacting system of massless dirac fermions ( mdfs ) all pointed to ultrashort e - e inelastic carrier lifetimes , with a sensitive dependence on doping .     of electron states .",

    "previous works , however , heavily relied on numerical analysis and did not address the following issues . when electrons in graphene are described by the low - energy 2d mdf model  @xcite , a special class of two - body scattering processes poses a serious conundrum . these are `` collinear '' events , in which incoming and outgoing momenta of the scattering particles lie on the same line  @xcite ( see fig .

    "is very tempted to conclude that they are irrelevant , since they lie on a one dimensional ( 1d ) manifold embedded in a 2d space , i.e.  a set of zero measure . as we will see in sec .",
    "[ ssec : coulombkernel ] , this intuitive statement can be formally proven by employing conservation of energy and momentum .",

    "ii ) interactions ( even at the hartree - fock level  @xcite ) are responsible for deviations of the energy - momentum dispersion relation from linearity .",
    "the renormalized quasiparticle spectrum , controlled by the real part of the quasiparticle self - energy , displays a concave curvature  @xcite , an effect that suppresses collinear scattering .",
    "iii ) the broadening of the energy - momentum dispersion , which follows from the finiteness of the quasiparticle lifetime ( an effect beyond the hartree - fock theory ) , opens up the phase space for collinear scattering , as thoroughly discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect : auger ] .",
    "the broadening of the quasiparticle spectrum is controlled by the imaginary part of the quasiparticle self - energy , a quantity directly probed by angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite .",
    "iv ) the situation is further complicated by the role of _ screening _ , a key phenomenon in systems with long - range coulomb interactions  @xcite . as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ sect : screening ] , static screening does not have a detrimental effect on collinear scattering .",
    "the opposite occurs when dynamical screening is considered at the level of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "v ) non - linearities and anisotropies in the band structure beyond the mdf model ( such as `` trigonal warping ''  @xcite ) may affect the efficiency of screening .",
    "these issues were recently addressed in ref .   by means of the equilibrium many - body perturbation theory , as we will discuss in sec .",
    "[ ssec : screeningmodels ] .",
    "all these issues raise the following question : is collinear scattering relevant or irrelevant to understand quasiparticle dynamics and transport in graphene ?",
    "collinear ( or forward ) scattering plays a special role in the dynamics of quasiparticles  @xcite and photo - excited carriers in graphene  @xcite . the finiteness of the quasiparticle lifetime on the mass shell  @xcite can be traced back to the divergence of the density of electron - hole pairs in the collinear direction . in this case , it is the only configuration in which `` impact ionization '' ( imi ) and `` auger recombination '' ( ar ) processes are possible  @xcite ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : scatteringprocesses ] ) .",
    "imi and ar ( which we will refer to with the generic term `` auger processes '' ) have been studied since the later fifties  @xcite . in recent years they attracted attention in the context of semiconductors  @xcite and quantum dots  @xcite .",
    "imi and ar are of fundamental interest because they strongly influence the relaxation dynamics of a he d .",
    "e.g. , ar in optically - pumped 2d electron systems in the quantum hall regime is responsible  @xcite for emission from states with energy higher than those optically pumped , and thwarts the realization of a landau - level laser , i.e.  a laser that would operate under the 2d landau quantization , with population inversion in the landau levels  @xcite .",
    "most importantly , auger processes can be exploited to design solar cells  @xcite or other photovoltaic devices that can overcome fundamental limitations  @xcite to photocurrent production by relying on `` carrier multiplication '' ( cm ) .",
    "we reported evidence of auger processes in graphene  @xcite , proving the existence of imi and cm in a short transient following ultrafast photo - excitation in the optical domain  @xcite .",
    "the excess energy of photo - excited electrons can also be transferred to secondary electron - hole pairs by intra - band scattering , _ without _ cm from the valence to conduction band .",
    "this process , also recently experimentally demonstrated  @xcite , proceeds by promotion of electrons from below to above the fermi energy and does not involve processes b)-d ) in fig .",
    "[ fig : scatteringprocesses ] . on the other hand , refs .  , by probing the non - equilibrium dynamics of mdfs by time- and angle - resolved photo - emission spectroscopy , found no evidence for cm .",
    "we note , however , that refs .   operated in a regime of pump fluences @xmath2 where cm is not expected on the basis of calculations relying on static screening  @xcite .",
    "moreover , both experiments lacked sufficient time resolution to observe cm .",
    "indeed , the higher the pump fluence , the shorter is the time window in which cm exists  @xcite .",
    "e.g. , for a pump fluence @xmath3 as in ref .",
    ", cm exists in a time window @xmath4 ( substantially larger than the time resolution in ref .  ) .",
    "refs .   used much higher pump fluences , i.e.  @xmath5 and @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "ref .   reported strong evidence of population inversion in graphene after intense photoexcitation , similar to what reported in ref .",
    ", where evidence of stimulated emission was seen for pump fluences @xmath7 . because of the large fluences in refs .",
    ", the existence of population inversion can not be ascribed to the absence of auger processes .    in semiconductors , imi ( ar )",
    "creates ( annihilates ) an electron - hole pair and takes place when the energy transfer to ( from ) one electron is sufficient to overcome the band gap . since graphene is a zero - gap semiconductor , the scattering rates of auger processes are generally larger than in most other common semiconductors , as discussed in ref .  .",
    "however , ref .   did not address the issue of the vanishing phase space for 2d mdf bare bands .",
    "moreover , the imi and ar rates calculated in ref .",
    "refer to fd distributions [ eq .  ( 20 ) in ref .  ] , thus do not apply to generic non - equilibrium situations .",
    "finally , ref .   did not discuss the role of dynamical screening , now known to play a pivotal role in the electronic and optoelectronic properties of graphene  @xcite .",
    "here we analyze in detail the interplay between collinear scattering and e - e interactions in the context of the non - equilibrium dynamics of photo - excited electrons .",
    "we first show that electron lifetime effects open up a finite phase space for collinear scattering processes , thereby regularizing the pathologies mentioned above . here",
    "we consider the broadening of the energy - momentum dispersion , but we neglect its deviations from linearity due to e - e interactions . although these two effects could be treated in principle on an equal footing ( since they are described by the imaginary and real part of the quasiparticle self - energy , respectively ) , changes in the dispersion due to the real part of the quasiparticle self - energy are relevant only for low carrier densities  @xcite . while our theory is general , the numerical calculations we present in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] are focused on a regime with large density of photo - excited carriers , @xmath8 .",
    "this is a value that is typically used in experimental time - resolved techniques for mapping the relaxation dynamics of electron distributions  @xcite .",
    "we then discuss the contribution of collinear processes to the coulomb collision integral in the semiclassical boltzmann equation ( sbe ) , which determines , _ together _ with electron - optical phonon ( e - ph ) scattering , the early stages ( sub-@xmath0 ) of the time evolution .",
    "most importantly , we go beyond the fermi golden rule , by introducing screening at the rpa level .",
    "contrary to what happens in a conventional 2d parabolic - band electron gas  @xcite , the introduction of _ dynamical _ screening brings in _ qualitative _ new features . on one hand ,",
    "rpa dynamical screening represents the most natural and elementary way to regularize  @xcite the logarithmic divergences of quasiparticle decay rates and transport coefficients  @xcite . on the other hand , due to a @xmath9 divergence that arises in the polarization function  @xcite @xmath10 of 2d mdfs when the collinear scattering condition @xmath11 is met , rpa dynamical screening",

    "we therefore decided for computational convenience to consider an isotropic distribution as initial condition for the semiclassical boltzmann equation , without loss of generality .",

    "indeed , it was experimentally shown  @xcite that the latter effect should be considered when applying pump pulses with duration comparable to the electron - phonon scattering time , which exceeds the @xmath0 time scale of our present work .",

    "we checked that our results are very stable with respect to changes of this type .",
    "the coulomb - scattering - induced broadening of the he d in the initial @xmath290 is much larger than the broadening due to phonons .",
    "we took into account both electron - electron and electron - phonon scattering during the whole time evolution , and showed that electron - phonon scattering does indeed play a minor role also in the initial , coulomb - scattering - dominated , stage of the dynamics .",
    "intra- and inter - band coherences were previously considered  @xcite in the framework of the density - matrix formalism (  semiconductor bloch equations \" ) . in the range of parameters we used here",
    ", the solution of the semiclassical boltzmann equation agrees with these results . taking coherences into consideration gives minor oscillations of the electron density ( analogous to the rabi oscillations in a two - level system  @xcite ) , which damp out quickly due to dephasing induced by electron and phonon scattering .",
    "genuine quantum kinetic effects  @xcite affect the dynamics on time scales of a few fs . to the best of our knowledge , quantum kinetic theory was never applied to ultrafast electron dynamics in graphene .",
    "although quantum kinetic effects are fundamental to describe the _ coherent buildup _ of screening  @xcite , here we targeted the role of screening in the time window @xmath291 .",
    "the effects of screening on this time scale are a dominant contribution to the dynamics , and it is unlikely that a more precise description of the buildup of screening can substantially alter this picture .",
    "indeed , it is known  @xcite that quasi - classical theories can be used to fit coulomb quantum kinetics on a timescale longer than @xmath283 .",
    "we also point out that it is an extremely difficult task to estimate _ a priori _ the short initial transient in which the coherent buildup of screening takes place . in an equilibrium state ,",
    "basic consideration of the screening dynamics  @xcite suggests that the buildup of screening , on a given length scale , should take place on a time scale comparable with the period of the plasma oscillations at the corresponding wavelength .",
    "this implies that coherent screening buildup is faster in systems with a large carrier density ( several hundreds @xmath44 ) , which corresponds to the parameters that we use in this work .",
    "however , the initial state that we consider is strongly displaced from equilibrium and the relation between coherent buildup of screening and carrier density is less clear .",
    "it is arguable that electron - electron scattering is much more effective in a non - equilibrium state than in a thermal state , thus the electron - scattering - induced dephasing further reduces the time span where coherent buildup of screening plays a relevant role .",
    "a second outcome of quantum kinetic theory is the ability to describe memory ( or non - markovian ) effects , which could play in principle an important role on ultrafast time scales . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the general effect of using a quantum kinetic equation is to introduce oscillations in the response of the system on very short timescales , typically of the order of @xmath274 in solid state systems .",
    "we focused here on the time window @xmath292 , where memory effects which survive for a few @xmath274 only are likely to be irrelevant .",
    "moreover , memory effects seem to be very important in systems with long - range coulomb interactions  @xcite . in our system , instead , electron - electron interactions are well screened since we are studying the dynamics of a high - density droplet of excited carriers . in the case of effectively short - range interactions ,",
    "memory effects are much less pronounced  @xcite and seem to be more important at low energies  @xcite . in graphene the density - of - states vanishes at low energies , therefore further suppressing them .",
    "thus , although our theory does not apply down to the few-@xmath274 time scale , where the coherent buildup of screening and memory effects take place , these effects do not change the dynamics in the window of interest , @xmath291 . in this time window",
    "we demonstrated that it is of utmost importance to have an accurate description of screening , which dominates the relaxation dynamics .",
    "an analytical treatment of the coulomb collision integral distinguishes our work from previous ones  @xcite . in this respect , our main result , eq .

    "<S> we present a combined analytical and numerical study of the early stages ( sub-@xmath0 ) of the non - equilibrium dynamics of photo - excited electrons in graphene . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the semiclassical boltzmann equation with a collision integral that includes contributions from electron - electron ( e - e ) and electron - optical phonon interactions . taking advantage of circular symmetry and employing the massless dirac fermion ( mdf ) hamiltonian , we are able to perform an essentially analytical study of the e - e contribution to the collision integral . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to take particular care of subtle collinear scattering processes  processes in which incoming and outgoing momenta of the scattering particles lie on the same line  including carrier multiplication ( cm ) and auger recombination ( ar ) . </S>",
    "<S> these processes have a vanishing phase space for two dimensional mdf bare bands . </S>",
    "<S> however , we argue that electron - lifetime effects , seen in experiments based on angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy , provide a natural pathway to regularize this pathology , yielding a finite contribution due to cm and ar to the coulomb collision integral . finally , we discuss in detail the role of physics beyond the fermi golden rule by including screening in the matrix element of the coulomb interaction at the level of the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , focusing in particular on the consequences of various approximations including static rpa screening , which maximizes the impact of cm and ar processes , and dynamical rpa screening , which completely suppresses them . </S>"
