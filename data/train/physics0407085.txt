    "[ galva ] .",
    "the source of neutral gallium atoms is an hollow cathode discharge lamp ( galvatron ) made by hamamatsu ( series l2783 - 31ar - ga ) .",
    "the see - through cathode has a cylindrical shape with a hole of 3  mm diameter and 15  mm length .",
    "the maximum current applicable to the discharge before breaking is limited to 6  ma .",
    "gallium atoms are sputtered from the cathode surface by energetic argon ions produced in the neutral buffer gas ( argon ) .",
    "the equilibrium between ion production and recombination process leads to a gas of neutral atomic gallium forming in the cathode region .",
    "the argon gas pressure is fixed by the company to a value of 6  torr to enable a low current operation of the gallium galvatron .",
    "the laser absorption was monitored independently for the two transitions sending a probe beam of about @xmath24 and @xmath25 through the plasma generated in the galvatron .",
    "the signal was detected using photodiodes ( thorlabs det110 ) .",
    "a frequency calibration of the scan was obtained using a confocal fabry - perot interferometer with a free spectral range of 300 mhz ( coherent spectrum analyzer 33 - 6552 ) .",
    "we performed a systematic study of the absorption signals of gallium transitions as a function of the galvatron current for both transitions .",
    "we measured the absolute absorption of the probe by looking at its transmission signal straight from a photodiode .",
    "the maximum absorption at the line center we could detect was always below 3% .",
    "hence the sample is optically thin . to enhance the signal and look for saturation effects we aligned a _ pump _ beam of about @xmath26 and @xmath27 ( from the same laser source ) with the probe in a counter - propagating beam configuration .",
    "the _ pump _ was chopped at high frequency ( 1  khz ) and the probe signal was detected by means of a lock - in amplifier .",
    "figures  [ spettri - galva ]  ( a ) and ( b ) show doppler broadened absorption spectra obtained in this configuration at 403  nm and 417  nm respectively .    in a standard alkali vapor cell with no collisional",
    "broadening , using a counter - propagating beam configuration yields to the detection of the doppler - free homogeneous lineshapes .",
    "this is a standard technique based on the saturation of the atomic transition by the pump used for example to actively stabilize infrared ecdls in alkalis experiment ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "the situation is more complex in a galvatron because of velocity changing collisions ( vcc ) occurring in the glow that can decrease or prevent the saturation of a specific velocity class ( in particular the zero velocity class responsible for the appearance of the doppler - free peaks )  @xcite .",
    "velocity changing collisions distribute atoms among the different velocity classes and thus produce a broad pedestal in the saturated absorption spectrum .",
    "when the mass ratio between the _ perturber _ and _ active _ atom ( argon and gallium in our case ) is not too large , a single collision completely thermalizes the atomic velocity distribution .",
    "this is called _ strong _ collision regime  @xcite . the pedestal shape in this case is a gaussian with a width changing with the buffer gas pressure . in the case of strong collisions and high intensity pump",
    "the width equals the doppler width @xmath28 and the vcc signal becomes independent of pump intensity . for high buffer gas pressure ( as in our case ) the strong vcc actually destroy the doppler - free signal . in our spectra",
    "no sub - doppler feature was visible and the absorption lines were well described by a superposition of gaussian profiles . indeed the buffer gas pressure of 6  torr in our galvatron causes the disappearance of the sub - doppler features .",
    "this can not be avoided because a low current operation is needed due to the low melting point temperature of gallium .    in fig .",
    "[ spettri - galva ]  ( c ) and ( d ) we have plotted the absorption signals while changing the galvatron current showing the growth of the atomic density in the glow .",
    "absorption profiles were obtained both with and without pump beam ( i.e. without lock - in amplification ) .",
    "we have verified that the two situations , hence the fwhm and lineshapes , are completely equivalent . in fig .",
    "[ spettri - galva ] we showed the ones obtained using the lock - in amplification to enhance the signals and have a better resolution to determine fwhm , amplitude and centers of the lines even at lower currents .    [ [ analysis ] ] analysis : + + + + + + + + +    an accurate analysis has been made by taking into account the hf components and the different isotope abundances .",
    "we fit the observed curves as a sum of several gaussians ( one for each hf transition ) , imposing the same width for all curves @xmath29 .",
    "this is the doppler width resulting from the temperature of the gas .",
    "moreover we fix the distance between the centers and the ratio between the amplitudes following the predicted hf structure of fig .",
    "[ theor - spectra ]  ( d ) and ( e ) . figure [ relabs ]  ( a ) shows the dependence on the galvatron current for the @xmath29 derived from this analysis .",
    "the uncertainty on the data points from the fit is of the order of @xmath30 .",
    "the width of the lines ( hence the temperature ) appears to be constant within the range of current explored .",
    "the width @xmath29 obtained from the multiple hf fit is consistently lower than the widths obtained from single gaussian profiles for both 403  nm and 417  nm transitions as expected . from the doppler width",
    "we can deduce the temperature of the neutral gas by the relation  @xcite :    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the molar weight , @xmath33 the gas constant , @xmath34 the speed of light and @xmath35 the frequency of the transition .",
    "considering all the @xmath29 values calculated for each transition , the temperature estimated was @xmath36  k with an uncertainty of 4% .",
    "this takes into account the fluctuations on the width obtained from different spectra .",
    "the absorption of light passing through an atomic sample of length @xmath37 and absorption coefficient @xmath38 , is expressed by the lambert - beer s law  @xcite :    @xmath39.\\ ] ]    in our case this can be simplified by assuming a uniform density of neutral atoms in the plasma and optically thin samples . hence introducing the absorption cross - section @xmath40 for the fine structure transition @xmath41 and the lower state density of absorbing atoms @xmath42 we can express the absorbance as :    @xmath43    in our case to have a correct estimate of the atomic density in the glow we have also to account for the hyperfine and isotope composition of the lines .",
    "thus by using the multiple fitting procedure as made for the temperature , we are able to give an estimate of the number of absorbing atoms by evaluating the peak absorption for a single hf line of a defined isotope :    @xmath44    where @xmath45 is the normalized intensity of the i - th hf component .",
    "the absorption cross - section in a glow discharge is related to the temperature of the sample , the wavelength and decay rate of the transition .",
    "this can be expressed as  @xcite :    @xmath46    where @xmath33 is the gas constant , @xmath32 the molar weight and @xmath47 the degeneracy of the fine structure levels . for our measurements",
    "the temperature in the glow was constant and we can use the value deduced from the doppler width to obtain the absorption cross - section for the two transitions @xmath48 and @xmath49 with a 2% uncertainty coming from the uncertainty on the temperature .",
    "figure  [ relabs ]  ( b ) shows the atomic density in the glow evaluated from each spectrum using eq .",
    "[ density ] ( with @xmath50  mm being the cathode length ) .",
    "the population in the @xmath51 state ( extracted from the 417  nm spectra ) is about two times larger than the population in the @xmath52 state ( extracted from the 403  nm spectra ) .",
    "in fact our measurements are made in a galvatron where the neutral atomic sample is created by sputtering and recombination of gallium ions from the cathode .",
    "the population in the two p ground levels depends upon the recombination process that creates highly excited atoms decaying in the ground states through spontaneous emission .",
    "thus this is mainly determined by the branching ratio for the s to p transitions and much less by the boltzmann factor or by optical pumping .",
    "[ [ optical - pumping ] ] optical pumping : + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    another important aspect in the gallium lambda system is the optical pumping within the two p ground states .",
    "we have verified the role played by it in the galvatron absorption spectra by looking at the absorption of the weak probe ( @xmath24 ) tuned on the 403  nm lines in presence of a strong ( @xmath26 ) _ pump _ beam at 403  nm ( from the same laser ) or a _ repump _",
    "beam tuned at 417  nm ( specifically on the @xmath53 transition and @xmath27 ) .",
    "when the _ pump _ was superposed to the probe we could observe a 33% decrease of the absorption signal .",
    "on the other hand when the _ repump _ was superposed we could observe an increase of the probe absorption up to 55% of the original signal .",
    "finally when both _ pump _ and _ repump _ were aligned there was an increase of the probe absorption of about 35% .",
    "all these values and line shapes did not change by having the beams co - propagating or counter - propagating confirming the crucial role of velocity - changing collisions in smearing out the saturation effects .",
    "+ in principle an alternative option for spectroscopy investigation is to monitor the discharge current i.e. to detect an optogalvanic signal  @xcite .",
    "sub - doppler resolution in the gallium lines was shown in  @xcite by the use of optical - optical double resonance spectroscopy with optogalvanic detection . in this work two frequencies at @xmath54  nm and @xmath55  nm acted on the @xmath56 level cascade .",
    "saturation of the blue line was achieved in a hollow cathode cooled with liquid nitrogen to reduce the discharge noise and pressure .",
    "we have verified that with our setup ( no liquid nitrogen cooling ) we were able to detect an optogalvanic signal .",
    "however this reproduced the doppler broadened profiles for both transitions with no sub - doppler features visible .",
    "[ [ atomic - beam ] ] atomic beam : + + + + + + + + + + + +    the vacuum system has been carefully planned according to the following criteria : keep the system as simple and standard as possible within the current uhv technologies ; have the possibility to extend and implement the setup for anf into a molecular beam epitaxy ( mbe ) system ; allow the optical access needed for the laser cooling and manipulation of gallium atoms .",
    "the vacuum chamber can be divided in three regions : i ) production of the gallium atomic beam ; ii ) collimation ( through mechanical and eventually optical means ) and probing ; iii ) optical focusing and deposition on a substrate .",
    "the atomic source is a gallium effusion cell ( dual filament type dfc-63 - 60 - 300-wk by createc - fischer , erligheim , de ) .",
    "the pbn ( pyrolitic - bore - nitrate ) crucible has been specially designed in order to have a horizontal atomic beam and to avoid damaging the oven by gallium reacting with the heating elements .",
    "the crucible is made of four parts : an outer standard cylindrical crucible , an inner boat shaped part where gallium is evaporated , a spacer and a 1  mm insert placed at the _ lip _ of the outer crucible ( that is always kept at a temperature 120  @xmath4c higher than the inner part to avoid gallium condensation ) .    to keep a good ultra - high vacuum we use two ion pumps ( 40  l / s in the oven region and 55  l / s in the cooling and deposition region ) that are switched on after a roughing and bake - out of the system",
    "is obtained .",
    "this gives a pressure of about @xmath57  mbar in the deposition region ( if required a better uhv could be achieved by the use of a non evaporable getter pump ) .",
    "the effusion cell is generally operated at a temperature of 1100  @xmath4c ( the gallium vapor pressure at this temperature is @xmath58  mbar ) .",
    "the atomic beam coming out from the cell is collimated by a 1  mm skimmer placed 5  cm after the effusive source . according to knudsen law this source",
    "provides a flux of atoms after the skimmer of about @xmath59  atoms / s with a most probable velocity of @xmath60  m / s along the longitudinal direction .",

    "the top parts of fig .  [ atbeam ] show two images of our gallium atomic beam obtained using the 403  nm ecdl tuned on resonance with the @xmath61 hyperfine transition for the two different isotopes . from the analysis of these gaussian profiles and the geometry of the beams we extracted information on the width of the atomic beam and obtained a divergence of @xmath62  mrad .",
    "this result is consistent with an estimate of about 20  mrad obtained from the geometry of the collimating holes .",
    "the lif signal generated by the laser beam has been also collected on a photodiode and analyzed using a phase sensitive detection ( psd ) for the two transitions independently .",
    "a reference modulation frequency ( 1  khz ) is sent to the ecdl current while the lif signal is recorded through lock - in amplification .",
    "a scan was sent to the ecdl piezo in order to observe the hyperfine resolved spectra of gallium at 403  nm and 417  nm .",
    "typical signals are shown in fig .",
    "[ hfspectra ] .",
    "the ( a ) and ( b ) plots have been obtained with laser intensity of about @xmath26 and @xmath27 respectively .",
    "the 100  mhz large broadening of the derivative signals is not only due to laser power broadening but also to the applied dither on the laser current needed to enhance the signal to noise ratio . in fact lowering the applied dither and the laser power we have split the closest doublets as shown in fig .  [ hfspectra ]  ( c ) and ( d ) .",
    "these spectra were obtained with an intensity of @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "the width reduces to 50  mhz , that agrees well with what is expected from the beam divergence .",
    "we verified that at large amplitude of the dither the spectra were fitted by a gaussian profile , while lowering the dither the dispersive signals become closer to multiple lorentzian derivative signals .",
    "in fact we expect the psd spectra to be derivatives of voigt profiles .",
    "a study of line shapes in frequency - modulation spectroscopy is beyond the scope of this paper . for a comprehensive investigation in atomic media",
    "see for example the work by xia _ et al . _",
    "external cavity diode lasers at 403 nm and 417 nm have been tested and tuned on resonance with gallium transitions .",
    "laser absorption spectroscopy in a galvatron has proved to be a useful tool for a quick tuning of the ecdls .",
    "we have used these laser sources to study absorption spectroscopy in a gallium hollow cathode exploring the atom density production and doppler width ( hence temperature ) as a function of discharge current .",
    "although sub - doppler features were not visible in a simple saturated absorption configuration , the gallium galvatron has proved to be a very useful tool to perform absorption spectroscopy of atomic gallium with the ecdls in the blue .",
    "we have also built the vacuum system and produced a collimated thermal atomic beam of gallium in a uhv environment . using the ecdls we have performed lif detection with a phase sensitive technique enhancing the hyperfine resolved spectra of gallium .",
    "our interest in gan - based diode lasers lies mainly in their use for laser cooling and atom nano - fabrication .",
    "there is no closed transition from the true ground state suitable for laser cooling and two alternatives are possible : a two - colour laser cooling using diode lasers at 403  nm and 417  nm on the p states  @xcite or laser cooling at 294  nm ( by frequency doubling a dye laser ) , where a closed transition exists between the @xmath51 and @xmath65 states ( this scheme is in use at colorado state university by the group of s.a.lee  @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to use the blue and violet diode chips to investigate two - colour laser cooling on the p - s transitions .",
    "the peculiarities of the gallium lower energy levels open up many interesting problems regarding the best cooling scheme to be used for the atomic beam collimation . from our first divergence measurements we can estimate the initial width of the transverse velocity distribution to be close to the velocity capture range @xmath66 ( i=1,2 )  @xcite , 9.2  m / s for gallium . if we consider a doppler cooling on one of the transition at 403  nm or 417  nm , we need to scatter few thousand photons to reach velocities of the order of the doppler limit @xmath67  cm / s , corresponding to a divergence of about 0.4  mrad well suited for anf .",
    "an interesting perspective is the use of two - colour doppler cooling in a similar fashion as in the work by rooijakkers  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on helium atoms . in the case of helium",
    "we have a cascade three - level system .",
    "optimum cooling parameters were found , showing that the cooling force is an order of magnitude stronger than for a two - level system . in the gallium case",
    "we have a lambda system involving the p - s transitions .",
