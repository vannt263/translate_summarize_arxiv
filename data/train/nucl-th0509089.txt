    "chiral symmetry breaking is an important phenomena in hadron physics and is of fundamental importance for hadron properties .",

    "the standard scenario for spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is the arising of a quark condensate . in the njl model",
    "the condensates appear when the strength of the contact interaction exceeds a critical value , separating the wigner - weyl and nambu - goldstone realizations of chiral symmetry .",
