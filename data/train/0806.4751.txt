    "the emergence of irreversibility from reversible dynamics in large systems has been one of the fundamental questions in science since the days of maxwell and boltzmann .",
    "the famous debate about the statistical character of the second law of thermodynamics and the related controversy about boltzmann s _ stozahlansatz _ in the derivation of his transport equation has been very fruitful for physics and mathematics . after lanford s rigorous justification of the boltzmann equation for a classical many  particle system at short kinetic time scales@xcite , the mathematical justification of the boltzmann equation at longer timescales has remained a challenge up to the present time .",
    "the analogous statement for quantum systems remains open even at the short kinetic timescale .",
    "a related important question is to understand how brownian motion emerges as an effective law from time - reversal - invariant microscopic physical laws , as given by a hamiltonian system or the schr \" odinger equation .",
    "kesten - papanicolaou@xcite proved that the velocity distribution of a classical particle moving in an environment consisting of random scatterers ( i.e. , lorenz gas with random scatterers ) converges to a brownian motion in a weak coupling limit in dimensions @xmath0 . in this model the bath of light particles whose fluctuations lead to the brownian motion of the observed particle is replaced with random static impurities .",
    "a similar result was obtained in @xmath1 dimensions@xcite .",
    "recently@xcite , the same evolution was controlled on a longer time scale and the position process was proven to converge to brownian motion as well .",
    "bunimovich and sinai@xcite proved the convergence of the periodic lorenz gas with a hard core interaction to a brownian motion . in this model",
    "the only source of randomness is the distribution of the initial condition .",
    "finally , drr , goldstein and lebowitz@xcite proved that the velocity process of a heavy particle in a light ideal gas , which is a model with a dynamical environment , converges to the ornstein - uhlenbeck process .",
    "although brownian motion was discovered and first studied theoretically in the context of classical dynamics , it also describes the motion of a quantum particle in a random environment , on a timescale that is long compared to the standard kinetic timescale@xcite . in the following",
    "we describe this result and the strategy of the proof in a bit more detail .",
    "besides the motivation discussed above , the random schr \" odinger operator that we study is also the standard model for transport of electrons in metals with impurities , which plays a central role in the theory of the metal ",
    "insulator transition@xcite .",
    "the outstanding open mathematical question in this area is the proof of the extended states conjecture , stating that in dimensions @xmath2 , at weak disorder , the spectrum of such hamiltonians is absolutely continuous . despite much effort",
    ", this conjecture has up to now only been proven@xcite on the bethe lattice , which can be interpreted as the case @xmath3 . in a system with a magnetic field , the existence of dynamical delocalization at certain energies near the landau levels has been proven recently@xcite .",
    "we consider random schr \" odinger operators , both on a lattice and in the continuum , in @xmath4 dimensions . in this presentation , we focus on the case @xmath5 .",
    "the time evolution of the _ anderson model _ ( am ) is generated by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the standard discrete laplacian and the potential is given by @xmath8 , with @xmath9 , and @xmath10 independent identically distributed ( i.i.d . )",
    "random variables .",
    "we assume that @xmath11 satisfies @xmath12 the continuum analogue of this model is the _ quantum lorentz model _ ( qlm ) , where @xmath13 on @xmath14 , with @xmath15 the standard laplacian , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a fixed spherically symmetric schwarz function with @xmath18 supp @xmath19 , @xmath20 is a poisson point process on @xmath21 with homogeneous unit density and i.i.d .",

    "again , @xmath25 is assumed to satisfy ( [ momentcondition ] ) .",
    "suppose the initial state is localized , i.e.  @xmath26 is smooth .",
    "how does the solution @xmath27 behave for large @xmath28 ?",
    "if @xmath29 , the time evolution is easily calculated in fourier space : @xmath30 , with @xmath31 ( qlm ) or @xmath32 ( am ) .",
    "it is equally easy to see that the motion is ballistic , i.e.   @xmath33 if @xmath34 , one expects either localization , @xmath35 for all @xmath28 , or diffusive behaviour ( extended states ) , @xmath36 , depending on @xmath37 and @xmath26 .",
    "the localized behaviour corresponds to dense pure point spectrum at almost every energy ; this was proven for large disorder@xcite and away from the spectrum of the laplacian .",
    "extended states correspond to absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "as mentioned , the latter has been proven@xcite on the cayley tree for small @xmath38 . at this time",
    "there is no proof of existence of extended states in @xmath5 . for a simpler case , namely that of randomness with a decaying envelopping function , i.e.   @xmath39 , @xmath40 i.i.d .",
    ", @xmath41 fixed , there is a proof@xcite that for @xmath42 and @xmath43 as @xmath44 , @xmath45 has absolutely continuous spectrum .",
    "our result is formulated in terms of the _ wigner function _ @xmath46 which can be thought of as an analogue of a phase space density ( but can become negative ) .",
    "its marginals are @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "moreover , @xmath49 on the lattice , one has to modify the definition of the wigner transform slightly@xcite .",
    "the _ kinetic scaling _ is given by @xmath50 i.e.  the microscopic time and space variables both become of order @xmath51 , so that velocities remain unscaled .",

    "@xmath54 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    this theorem was first proven for the continuum for small time @xmath55 @xcite , then for arbitrary time@xcite , and later extended to the lattice case@xcite .",
    "the _ diffusive scaling _ is defined by @xmath56 this is long compared to the kinetic timescale : the kinetic variables @xmath57 and @xmath55 diverge as @xmath58",
    "when @xmath59 and @xmath60 are kept fixed , @xmath61 a first hint at diffusion is that under this scaling @xmath62 is independent of @xmath37 .",
    "the result for the anderson model is    let @xmath5 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 be the solution to the random schr \" odinger equation with initial condition @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath66 is small enough and @xmath67 , then in the limit @xmath68 , @xmath69 converges weakly to the solution @xmath70 of a heat equation .",
    "more precisely : denote @xmath71 where @xmath72 .",
    "let @xmath73 and @xmath74 and let @xmath70 be the solution of the heat equation @xmath75 be a schwartz function on @xmath76 . then @xmath77 the limit is uniform on @xmath78 $ ] for any @xmath79 .",
    "we discuss some of the ideas in the proof of this theorem in section [ proofsec ] .",
    "if @xmath80 and @xmath81 is small enough , we have the more detailed error estimate @xmath82 the boltzmann equation also gives the same diffusion equation in the long time limit , but it was itself derived from the quantum mechanical time evolution only for shorter timescales .",
    "the main difficulty in the proof is to deal with contributions that vanish for @xmath58 under kinetic scaling , but that become important under the above  defined diffusive scaling .",
    "more technically speaking , in the feynman expansion done to analyze the time evolution , most of these terms would even diverge under diffusive scaling if we did not renormalize the propagator .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath83 are in an interval @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is a universal constant . for technical reasons , @xmath86 has to be chosen very small in the proof .",
    "heuristically , i.e.  ignoring many of the technical complications and assuming optimal bounds , one would expect the remainder of the renormalized feynman graph expansion to vanish up to @xmath87 , and to diverge for @xmath88 .",
    "the diffusive scaling leads to a diffusion on the energy shells .",
    "a diffusion mixing energy shells is expected to start at @xmath89 .",
    "an intuitive way of interpreting the expansion described below is as an expansion in the number @xmath90 of collisions of the particle with the randomly ( but statically ) arranged obstacles represented by the potential .",
    "as compared to the previous results@xcite , the main new feature here is that under diffusive scaling , the effective number of collisions of the particle diverges .",
    "that is , not only is it necessary to expand to an order @xmath90 that diverges as @xmath58 , but also the main contribution does not come from terms with a finite number of collisions .",
    "we discuss some of the ideas of the proof for the example of the anderson model , i.e.  the lattice situation . for the detailed bounds of feynman graphs",
    ", the lattice leads to a number of complications@xcite , but for the presentation it is easier .      let us start with a formal time  ordered expansion , setting @xmath91 and expanding in @xmath92 . then @xmath93 with @xmath94 where @xmath95 and @xmath96 because @xmath97",
    ", it is natural to split each @xmath98 further , @xmath99 .",
    "every sequence of obstacle labels @xmath100 represents a _ collision history _ , and for @xmath101 , the time variables @xmath102 in ( [ mudef ] ) are the time differences between two subsequent collisions .",
    "the delta function in ( [ mudef ] ) enforces the constraint that these time differences , together with the propagation times @xmath103 before the first collision and @xmath104 after the last one , add up to the total time @xmath28 .",
    "we shall discuss convergence questions about this expansion later .",
    "our detailed analysis takes place in momentum space , where each @xmath105 acts as a convolution operator , so that @xmath106 very schematically , one can represent this as follows , where each of the dashed lines represents a factor @xmath92 and each of the full lines gets a phase factor @xmath107 .",
    "as the convolution formula shows , one can define a momentum flow in this graph , where the momentum change @xmath108 flows away through the dashed line . before the disorder average",
    ", there is no translation invariance in the system , so every scattering at an obstacle changes the momentum of the particle .      recalling ( [ hat - wig ] ) , we have @xmath109 = \\sum_{n , n ' } \\sum_{{{\\bf a}}_n,{{\\bf a}}'_{n ' } }   { { \\mathbb e}}\\left [ \\overline{\\hat \\psi^{(n)}_{{{\\bf a}}_n } ( t , v - \\xi/2 ) } \\hat \\psi^{(n')}_{{{\\bf a}}'_{n ' } } ( t , v+\\xi/2 )   \\right ] .\\ ] ] note that there are now two , a priori independent , collision histories , one for @xmath110 and one for @xmath111",
    ". it will be part of the proof to show that , in the scaling limit we consider , the only contributions after self  energy renormalization come from the so - called ladder graphs , where the two collision histories are identical : @xmath112 and @xmath113 .    because the disorder is i.i.d .",
    ", translation invariance holds for the average , which means that momentum conservation also holds for the dashed lines , which for the anderson model simply correspond to a factor @xmath114 , since the second moment of the disorder was normalized to @xmath115 in ( [ momentcondition ] ) .",
    "the result can be represented as a graph built of two particle lines , particle  disorder vertices , which are joined by disorder lines , and , if the randomness is non - gaussian , disorder - disorder vertices , which correspond to the higher moments of the disorder distribution .",
    "an example is        particle lines get propagators @xmath116 , interaction lines give factors @xmath114 , and the disorder - disorder vertex of degree four corresponds to a factor @xmath117 .",
    "it is clear that in the way the expansion was introduced above , one really needs the assumption that arbitrary moments , not just the first @xmath118 ones , exist . the expansion employed in the true proof contains a stopping rule which avoids high moments , but we shall not discuss this here in more detail .",
    "in fact , we shall in the following assume for simplicity that the disorder is gaussian , so that there are no vertices of higher degree for the dashed lines , and the average just corresponds to a pairing of interaction lines .",
    "an example of a pairing is as follows        note that here , there is a crossing of the two pairing lines in the graphical representation , but there are no vertices in which more than one interaction line enters .",
    "a special class of pairings are the _ up  down pairings _ , where @xmath112 and the pairing corresponds to a permutation @xmath119 :        the most important term turns out to be the _ ladder graph _ , corresponding to @xmath120          in the following , we give a brief discussion of bounds of the contributions of individual graphs , restricting to up  down pairings .",
    "if one takes a bound in the representation ( [ psimom ] ) , each phase factor is replaced by @xmath115 .",
    "this leads to a bound of order @xmath121 ( where the @xmath122 comes from the time ordering implied by the delta function in ( [ mudef ] ) ) , which does not even allow to consider the kinetic scaling where @xmath123 is fixed .",
    "for this reason , the following _ propagator representation _ is useful .",
    "let @xmath124 .",
    "then , inserting the fourier representation of the delta function , @xmath125 it is convenient to choose @xmath126 .",
    "the contribution of a permutation @xmath127 , corresponding to an up  down pairing graph @xmath128 , to @xmath129 is @xmath130 at the moment , @xmath131 ; later , @xmath132 will change under renormalization and become complex .    a simple schwarz inequality separating the dependence on the @xmath133 and that on the @xmath134 implies that for all @xmath135 @xmath136 the ladder is easy to calculate at @xmath137 , and a ladder of length @xmath138 is of order @xmath139 .",
    "a crucial observation is that the values of graphs with _ crossings _ get inverse powers of @xmath28 , as compared to the ladder .",
    "this follows from the bound @xmath140 ( @xmath141 for the continuum ; @xmath142 on the lattice ) .",
    "@xmath143 in the continuum , @xmath144 on the lattice .",
    "again , here @xmath145 .",
    "this motivates why the ladder graph gives the dominant contribution under kinetic scaling . however , the number of graphs goes like @xmath122 , which cancels the @xmath146 , hence expanding to infinite order one gets majorants by geometric series , which converge only on very short kinetic timescales @xmath55 .",
    "this is the reason for the restriction to small kinetic timescales in the first proof@xcite of the boltzmann equation for the qlm .",
    "major progress@xcite came from the realization that one can do an expansion to finite order with an efficient remainder estimate .",
    "a natural way to generate a finite  order expansion is the _",
    "duhamel formula _",
    "@xmath147 iteration gives @xmath148 where @xmath149 and @xmath150 an alternative way of looking at this is via its relation to the resolvent formula @xmath151 where @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "iteration of the resolvent equation and using the fourier transform gives the above propagator representation directly .",
    "the duhamel formula is obtained via @xmath154    the second crucial ingredient is that one can use the unitarity of the full time evolution to reduce all terms to ones where no @xmath155 appears in the time evolution any more : @xmath156 thus @xmath157 the remaining integral over @xmath158 effectively gives a factor @xmath28 , which is the price to pay for this unitarity bound . to control this factor",
    ", one needs exhibit more factors @xmath159 in graphs with several independent crossings , and treat graphs with only one crossing explicitly ( in the resolvent iteration , the unitarity bound would be replaced by @xmath160 ) .    by a schwarz inequality",
    ", one can see that the wigner transform is continuous in @xmath161 norm : @xmath162 thus the unitarity bound can also be used for the wigner transform .",
    "the proof of the boltzmann equation@xcite on an arbitrarily large kinetic timescale @xmath55 uses an expansion up to order @xmath163 .",
    "the ladder terms give the gain term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "the lowest order self  energy correction gives the loss term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "it corresponds to the `` gate '' graph          because the ladder with @xmath138 rungs is of order @xmath164 , it diverges under diffusive scaling , and so do other graphs . to increase the time beyond @xmath51",
    ", we need to do a renormalization .",
    "formally , one can think of this as a resummation of the gate diagrams , which are of self  energy type , but this geometric series converges only for small @xmath123 .",
    "a way to avoid such formal resummations is to change the way @xmath155 is split into a `` free '' and an interaction part , i.e. , expand around a different @xmath165",
    ". for @xmath166 set @xmath167 this is the value of the gate diagram at energy @xmath168 in the anderson model ( in the qlm , the integrand contains an additional factor from the interaction function ) . the limit @xmath169 exists and is h \" older continuous@xcite in @xmath168 of order @xmath170 .",
    "let @xmath171 the idea is now to put @xmath172 as a counterterm , which by construction subtracts every insertion of a gate diagram at the point @xmath173 where the particle propagator is singular . because @xmath168 and @xmath174 appear only as auxiliary quantities in the expansion , it was necessary to take @xmath175 above and define @xmath176 in an @xmath168independent way .",
    "the counterterm is added and subtracted so that the hamiltonian does not change : let @xmath177 and decompose @xmath178 ( where @xmath179 denotes the momentum operator ) .",
    "the function @xmath132 can be thought of as a new dispersion relation of energy as a function of momentum .",
    "however , @xmath132 also has a negative imaginary part , roughly of order @xmath114 .",
    "more precisely , for @xmath4 there is @xmath180 such that @xmath181 thus @xmath165 is no longer selfadjoint .",
    "the negative sign of i m @xmath132 implies that the resolvent @xmath182 is still well - defined , since the imaginary parts add up with the same sign .",
    "correspondingly , the time evolution operator @xmath183 is no longer unitary but it remains bounded for @xmath184 .",
    "both the duhamel and the resolvent iteration are thus well - defined .",
    "besides the new propagator @xmath185 , the important change is that every factor @xmath186 now also contains a counterterm insertion @xmath187 .",
    "the point about these iterations is that they can be stopped ( or even modified ) after every expansion step .",
    "it is thus clear that one can group the counterterms that appear in the expansion together with the gates that get created when taking the average over the disorder .",
    "the cancellation among these two terms provides a small factor that makes such terms vanish in the diffusive scaling limit .",
    "moreover , it is clear that one can implement rules for stopping the expansion independently of the subsequent disorder average . in particular , because the randomness is i.i.d .",
    ", one can avoid moments beyond the power @xmath118 by stopping the expansion when a given site has appeared in the collision history @xmath188 times .",
    "the terms to which no such repetition or renormalization cancellation applies are expanded up to order @xmath189 , where @xmath190 depends on @xmath191 .",
    "the intuition behind this is that certain graphs with @xmath192 give the main contribution , and expanding up to an order that is @xmath193 higher leads again to small factors .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath132 gives effectively a regularization @xmath194 instead of @xmath195 for the denominators , which changes the values of all diagrams significantly .",
    "in particular , the integral for one rung of the ladder becomes @xmath196 where @xmath197 is a constant .",
    "thus with this renormalization , the ladders become of order 1 , so that one can go beyond kinetic scaling . indeed , in the language of feynman graphs , the main result can be stated informally as    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ after renormalization , the sum of the ladder graphs for the wigner transform converges to a solution of the heat equation in the diffusive scaling limit .",

    "they involve in particular proving that the terms which do not correspond to pure up ",
    "down pairings vanish in the limit , and dealing with a number of technical complications which arise from the fact that one has to do an expansion to a finite order .",
    "we have had to leave out almost all technical details to avoid overloading the presentation , but we should like to at least mention the heart of the proof here at the end , to clarify the main ideas about the feynman graph expansion .    focusing on up - down pairings , we have to deal with a combinatorial problem of bounding the sum over the @xmath122 permutations @xmath127 .",
    "as mentioned , with an expansion to infinite order , one can not get beyond the kinetic scaling because of this factor @xmath122 .",
    "the control of the remainders is done here by choosing an appropriate stopping @xmath138 for the expansion and by `` beating down the combinatorics by power counting '' .",
    "that is , we prove exponential suppression of the values of feynman graphs in the number of crossings they have , that is , loosely speaking , in their complexity .    the precise notion capturing the complexity of a permutation @xmath127 is its degree @xmath198 , defined as the number of non  ladder and non  antiladder indices . essentially , the ladder indices are those for which @xmath199 , and the antiladder indices are those for which @xmath200 .",
    "let @xmath201 be the feynman graph corresponding to @xmath202 .",

    "we have shown that , for random schr \" odinger operators with a weak static disorder the quantum mechanical time evolution can be controlled on large space and time scales where a diffusion equation governs the behavior .",
    "the schrdinger evolution is time ",
    "reversible  yet irreversibility on large scales emerges .",
    "this apparent controversy is resolved by noting that along the scaling limit microscopic degrees of freedom have been effectively integrated out .",
    "although the expansion methods we use bear some resemblance to those of constructive quantum field theory , there are also a few noteworthy differences .",
    "first , because we analyze the time evolution at real time , the ( near)singularities of the propagators are located on hypersurfaces , and not at points , as would be the case in euclidean field theories . the singularity structure is to some extent similar to that in real time fermi surface problems , although there is no fixed fermi surface here  the integrals over @xmath168 and @xmath215 `` test '' all possible level sets of the function @xmath216 , and this leads to a number of serious complications .",
    "second , we are able to control the combinatorics of a straightforward feynman graph expansion in momentum space , while the analysis in constructive field theory ( to our knowledge , always ) needs to be done by cluster expansions in position space to avoid the divergence of an infinite series of feynman graphs .",
    "the reason for this is twofold : the unitarity bound allows us to do an expansion to a finite order , and our strong improvement ( [ combest ] ) over standard power counting bounds allows us to push this order so high that we can reach the scale where diffusion sets in , while still retaining control of the remainders .",
    "the genuine challenge is to show diffusion without taking scaling limits , i.e. for a fixed ( small ) disorder @xmath37 and for any time independent of @xmath37 . with expansion techniques",
    ", this would require to renormalize not only the self ",
    "energy to arbitrary order but also the four  point functions .",
