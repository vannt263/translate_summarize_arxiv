    "<S> we update our earlier study in @xcite , which was inspired by the 2002 sno data , on the implications of the results of the solar neutrino experiments for the predictions of the effective majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta - decay , . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain predictions for using the values of the neutrino oscillation parameters , obtained in the analyzes of the presently available solar neutrino data , including the just published data from the salt phase of the sno experiment , the atmospheric neutrino and chooz data and the first data from the kamland experiment . the main conclusion reached in @xcite of the existence of significant lower bounds on in the cases of neutrino mass spectrum of inverted hierarchical ( ih ) and quasi - degenerate ( qd ) type is strongly reinforced by fact that combined solar neutrino data i ) exclude the possibility of @xmath0 at more than 5 s.d . </S>",
