    "an important accomplishment of recent work @xcite was then to prove numerically that rigorously defined hydrophobic interactions between atomic - sized hard sphere solutes in water also exhibit inverse - temperature behavior . independently , new results for broader solute models arrived at consistent conclusions for those cases @xcite . building from those important accomplishments ,",
