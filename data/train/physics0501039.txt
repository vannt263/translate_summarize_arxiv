    "one of the persistent problems in the development of a magnetic fusion reactor is the degradation of plasma confinement caused by turbulent transport . in spite of the strong confining magnetic field , high levels of energy and charged - particle transport across magnetic field lines",
    "are observed in a variety of experimental configurations , such as tokamaks and stellarators .",
    "this transport has received the adjective `` anomalous , '' as its features can not be explained by the classical or neoclassical collisional theories . instead , anomalous transport is generally attributed to small - scale , electrostatic plasma turbulence.@xcite in particular , the transport in the plasma edge is believed to be largely controlled by drift - wave turbulence , which appears naturally in this region as a result of the strong radial pressure gradient . the drift - wave transport mechanism has been the subject of much theoretical and experimental research over the past several decades , and was recently reviewed by horton.@xcite nevertheless , much of this transport phenomenon is yet to be fully understood .",
    "another important problem in the quest for controlled thermonuclear fusion that is linked to turbulence concerns the impurity content of the plasma .",
    "the properties of fusion plasmas are strongly influenced by the presence of impurities .",
    "for instance , impurities enhance radiative energy losses and dilute the hydrogen fuel within the hot plasma center , at the same time being the main agents in the erosion and deposition processes that affect plasma - facing components.@xcite consequently , the understanding of the transport mechanisms that control the impurity content in the plasma is of crucial importance for the performance and safe operation of future fusion devices .",
    "the transport of impurity particles across the magnetic field is related to that of the bulk plasma , since the motion perpendicular to the magnetic field of all charged particles in the plasma is dominated by one same velocity field , the electric drift velocity . in this sense ,",
    "impurities and bulk plasma are partly subject to a common mechanism of turbulent transport , which relates the problem of confinement to that of controlling the impurity content .",
    "however , the distinctive nature of impurity particles , notably their mass and electric charge , as well as their different influence on the plasma allow for disparities between the transport of impurities and that of the bulk plasma .",
    "in fact , recent experiments not only reveal disparities in the transport of impurities and bulk plasma,@xcite but also in that of different impurity species.@xcite in such experimental investigations impurity transport is usually characterized in terms of effective diffusion coefficients and drift velocities , the latter also known as pinch velocities.@xcite these transport coefficients are typically determined by analysis of the temporal evolution of injected impurity puffs .",
    "while the explanation for the diffusive character of turbulent transport goes back to the work of taylor and richardson in the 1920s,@xcite the origin of the anomalous pinch velocities is still a matter of intense research.@xcite moreover , the inward pinch observed in laboratory experiments tends to concentrate the impurities in the center of the plasma column,@xcite precisely where they are least wanted , and thus constitutes one of the major unresolved transport problems in fusion plasma physics .    in this contribution",
    "we investigate the turbulent transport of impurities in a generic model for plasma edge turbulence .",
    "specifically , the investigations are based on the simple and extensively studied model for resistive drift - wave turbulence proposed by hasegawa and wakatani.@xcite for the impurities , we use a consistent passive - fluid model that takes into account impurity - particle inertia , that is to say , it contemplates the polarization drift .",
    "this enables the model to exhibit different transport features depending on the mass and charge of the impurities , as observed in laboratory experiments .",
    "in particular , the polarization drift brings compressibility into the model , giving rise to subtle yet qualitatively important effects .",
    "the investigations are carried out by numerical simulations of the model equations using a newly developed code that applies semi - lagrangian pseudospectral schemes .",
    "we proceed separately for ideal ( i.e. , massless ) impurities and inertial ones . in the case of ideal impurities , we focus on the phenomenon of turbulent diffusion , which is studied from the relative - diffusion perspective . for inertial impurities ,",
    "we concentrate on the new effects that arise from compressibility .",
    "first , the density of inertial impurities is found to correlate with the vorticity of the electric drift velocity , that is , impurities cluster in vortices of a precise orientation determined by the charge of the impurity particles .",
    "this behavior is a direct consequence of compression by the polarization drift and turbulent mixing .",
    "second , we discover a radial pinch that scales linearly with the mass  charge ratio of the impurities . an understanding of this phenomenon is obtained by analysis of the evolution equation for the global impurity flux .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] the model for resistive drift - wave turbulence and the passive - fluid model for the impurities are described .",
    "the diffusive effect of turbulence is demonstrated in sec .",
    "[ sec : ideal ] for the case of ideal impurities .",
    "the effects that arise from impurity inertia , the clustering and the anomalous radial pinch , are respectively presented in secs .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] and [ sec : pinch ] .",
    "the results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclus ] .",
    "lastly , the appendix is devoted to a brief description of the numerical schemes applied in the simulations .",
    "in this section we provide a brief presentation of the resistive drift - wave paradigm used for modeling the turbulence at the plasma edge .",
    "we also describe the passive - fluid model for the impurity species , which takes into account impurity - particle inertia .      as a basic model for plasma edge turbulence",
    "we consider the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hasegawa  wakatani ( hw ) model for resistive drift - wave turbulence:@xcite    [ eq : hw ] @xmath0 \\label{eq : hw_w } { \\mathrm{d}_t{\\omega } } & = \\mathcal{c } ( \\varphi - n ) + \\mu_\\omega \\nabla_\\perp^2 \\omega,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 \\label{eq : ddt } { \\mathrm{d}_t { } } & \\equiv{{\\partial_{t}{}}}+{{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{\\hat{z}}}}}{\\boldsymbol{\\times}}{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}_\\perp\\varphi { \\boldsymbol{\\cdot}}{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}_\\perp.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here , @xmath2 denotes the fluctuating component of the plasma density , @xmath3 is the electrostatic potential , and @xmath4 is the vorticity of the electric drift velocity @xmath5 .",
    "the hw model assumes an unperturbed , uniform magnetic field in the @xmath6-direction , that is , @xmath7 .",
    "the @xmath8- and @xmath9-directions correspond respectively to the radial and the poloidal directions in a slab at the edge of the confined plasma .",
    "the electrons are assumed isothermal with temperature @xmath10 , whereas the ions are considered cold . the equilibrium plasma density @xmath11 is assumed to be homogeneous in the poloidal direction and to decrease in the radial direction in such a way that the equilibrium density length scale @xmath12 is constant .",
    "hence , in this thin - layer approximation the second term on the left - hand side of eq .   actually represents the advection of the inhomogeneous equilibrium plasma density by the electric drift .",
    "the quantities in eqs .   have been made dimensionless using the gyro - bohm normalization : @xmath13 here , @xmath14 is the sound speed and @xmath15 is the the drift scale , that is , the ion gyroradius at the sound speed . the parameter @xmath16 coupling eqs .   and is known as the adiabaticity parameter , and is defined as @xmath17 here , @xmath18 is the parallel resistivity and @xmath19 is the single parallel wave number that is considered in the reduction to a 2d model . in the strongly collisional limit @xmath20 , eq .   reduces to the 2d navier  stokes vorticity equation . in this so - called hydrodynamic limit",
    "the equations become decoupled and the plasma density is passively advected by the electric drift velocity . in the weakly collisional limit @xmath21 , the adiabatic electron response yields boltzmann - distributed density perturbations , @xmath22 , and the hw model reduces to the well - known hasegawa ",
    "mima equation.@xcite    the diffusive terms in eqs .   and correspond respectively to the collisional diffusion of electrons and the ion viscosity .",
    "these dissipative processes are essential for the stabilization of resistive drift modes as well as for the feasibility of numerically simulating the hw model .",
    "linear analysis of the hw model reveals the existence of unstable modes for @xmath23 , with all modes being unstable in the absence of dissipation.@xcite it is the combination of this linear instability with nonlinear interaction through the advective terms and dissipation at small scales that leads to quasistationary turbulent states within the hw model .",
    "in particular , when initialized with a broadband set of small - amplitude , random - phase modes , the system evolves in two stages : first , a linear phase in which the linearly unstable modes grow and the damped ones decay ; second , a phase of nonlinear saturation leading to a quasistationary turbulent state whose statistics solely depend on the parameters of the hw model .",
    "two relevant nonlinear invariants in the hw model are the total energy @xmath24 and the generalized enstrophy @xmath25 , defined as @xmath26 u & \\equiv \\frac{1}{2}{\\int{(n - \\omega)^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}{{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the evolution of these quantities within the hw model is governed by @xmath27 { \\frac{\\mathrm{d}{u}}{\\mathrm{d}t } } & = \\gamma_n - \\mathcal{d}^u,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 \\gamma_c & \\equiv \\mathcal{c } { \\int{(n-\\varphi)^2}\\,\\mathrm{d}{{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}}}},\\\\[0.5ex ] \\mathcal{d}^e & \\equiv { \\int{(\\mu_n{\\lvert{{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}_\\perp n}\\rvert}^2 + \\mu_\\omega{\\lvert{{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}_\\perp \\omega}\\rvert}^2)}\\,\\mathrm{d}{{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}}}},\\\\[0.5ex ] \\mathcal{d}^u & \\equiv { \\int{{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}_\\perp(n-\\omega){\\boldsymbol{\\cdot}}{\\boldsymbol{\\nabla}}_\\perp(\\mu_n n-\\mu_\\omega\\omega)}\\,\\mathrm{d}{{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}}}}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] hence , @xmath29 is the only source in the system , and corresponds to energy extracted from the equilibrium density gradient .",
    "conversely , @xmath30 is a sink corresponding to resistive dissipation through the parallel current , while @xmath31 and @xmath32 are sinks arising from collisionality and viscosity . being the sole source of energy and generalized enstrophy source within the hw model , @xmath29 is in practice positive definite.@xcite this fact is used in sec .  [",
    "sec : pinch ] to identify a source for radial drift of impurities .",
    "impurities are here regarded as a passive species , that is , they are advected by the turbulence but do not have any influence on it .",
    "this is a reasonable approximation for the situation in which the density of impurity particles is much lower than that of the bulk plasma .",
    "the modeling of the dynamics of impurities is consistent with that of the turbulence , in that it also follows from the drift - ordered fluid approach and the assumption of unperturbed , uniform magnetic field .",
    "the impurities are characterized by a density @xmath33 and a flow velocity @xmath34 .",
    "just as in the case of the ions in the bulk plasma , the impurities are assumed cold , with their motion parallel to the magnetic field likewise being neglected .",
    "therefore , the motion of the impurity fluid comprises only the electric drift @xmath35 and the polarization drift @xmath36 . under the same normalization applied to the turbulence model , the flow velocity of the impurities is hence given by @xmath37 where @xmath38 here , @xmath39 and @xmath40 are respectively the mass and the electric charge of the impurity particles . the impurity model resulting from the continuity equation",
    "is thus given by @xmath41 where the term on the right - hand side arises from collisional diffusion .",
    "the polarization drift , which represents the effect of impurity - particle inertia , constitutes a higher - order correction to the electric drift velocity .",
    "the influence of the former on the dynamics of impurities is determined by the dimensionless parameter @xmath42 , which varies with the mass  charge ratio of the impurity particles relative to that of the bulk - plasma ions . for ideal impurities @xmath43 and",
    "the impurities are solely advected by the electric drift . for inertial impurities",
    "@xmath42 has a nonzero value and the polarization drift can play a role in the dynamics .",
    "the value of @xmath42 is in any case small , since the length scale quotient @xmath44 is by assumption small .",
    "nevertheless , the polarization drift adds important qualitative features to the dynamics of impurities . in the case of static , uniform magnetic field",
    "the electric drift is incompressible , whereas the polarization drift is compressible .",
    "hence , the inclusion of the polarization drift in the impurity model allows for genuinely compressible effects , such as those described in secs .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] and [ sec : pinch ] .",
    "theoretical studies of the diffusive effect of plasma edge turbulence on passively advected impurities have previously relied on analysis of the absolute dispersion of test particles.@xcite the present approach is necessarily different , as the impurities are not modeled here as particles but as a fluid . in this section",
    "we investigate the turbulent diffusion of ideal impurities by relative - diffusion analysis of the evolution of impurity puffs.@xcite      we consider the release of a puff of ideal impurities into the turbulent field , which is a saturated turbulent state described by the hw model .",
    "the amount of impurities released is @xmath45 and the position @xmath46 of the center of mass of the impurity puff at any time instant is given by @xmath47 we define the relative position vector @xmath48 , which indicates position in a reference frame moving with the center of mass of the puff .",
    "the average evolution of impurity puffs can then be characterized by the following ensemble - averaged dispersion tensors : @xmath49 s_{ij}&\\equiv\\frac{1}{q}{\\left\\langle{{\\int{x'_i x'_j \\theta}\\,\\mathrm{d}{{\\ensuremath\\boldsymbol{\\mathrm{x}}}}}}\\right\\rangle},\\\\[1ex ] m_{ij}&\\equiv{\\left\\langle{c_i c_j}\\right\\rangle}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , the components of vectors and tensors have been indicated by subindices and the angular brackets stand for the ensemble average , that is , the average over many releases .",
    "the absolute - dispersion tensor @xmath50 measures the dispersion with respect to the origin of the fixed frame , whereas the relative - dispersion tensor @xmath51 measures the dispersion relative to the center of mass .",
    "the tensor @xmath52 quantifies the `` meandering '' of the center of mass .",
    "the dispersion tensors are related by @xmath53 which means that absolute dispersion consists of relative dispersion and meandering of the center of mass .",
    "relative - diffusion analysis focuses on the evolution of @xmath51 , that is , on the spreading of the puff relative to its center of mass . specifically , it is usually the diagonal elements @xmath54 that are of interest once the reference axes are adequately selected , in our case those corresponding to the radial and poloidal directions . in view of the above relation ,",
    "the meandering of the center of mass is eliminated in relative - diffusion analysis , which thus leads to better statistics in comparison with those of absolute diffusion .",
    "the evolution of the dispersion tensors depends on the initial size and shape of the puffs , the statistical properties of the turbulent velocity field , and the collisional diffusivity @xmath55 . under the assumption that @xmath55 is small , the evolution of @xmath54 for initially concentrated puffs follows three stages : first",
    ", a phase dominated by collisional diffusion that lasts while the puff is much smaller than the turbulent structures and is characterized by @xmath56 second , a transitional phase in which the size of the puff is comparable to that of the turbulent structures and @xmath54 typically evolve faster than linearly with time ( see ref .   for further discussions ) ; and last , a phase dominated by turbulent diffusion that starts when the puff is large compared to the turbulent structures and during which the evolution of @xmath54 can be characterized by effective diffusivities @xmath57 such that @xmath58 these diffusivities solely depend on the statistical properties of the turbulent velocity field ",
    "more precisely , they are related to the mean squared velocities and the lagrangian relative time scale .",
    "the last phase , dominated by turbulent diffusion , is most relevant for us , as it eventually dominates the transport of impurities .",
    "in fact , the effective diffusivities @xmath57 that characterize the phase of turbulent diffusion are equivalent in their definition to those employed in the experimental modeling of anomalous impurity transport.@xcite because in this last stage the diagonal elements @xmath54 grow linearly according to eq .  , the effective diffusivities @xmath57 can easily be obtained from the asymptotic evolution of @xmath54 .",
    "this is the procedure used here for estimating the effective diffusivities of the turbulent field acting on ideal impurities . in principle",
    ", any initial puffs could be used for the determination of the diffusivities . from the discussion above",
    ", large initial puffs rapidly experience the final phase of turbulent diffusion , and thus provide the effective diffusivities shortly after their release .",
    "however , care must be taken in numerical simulations that the puffs do not reach the boundaries of the simulation domain , as this would result in underestimates for the diffusivities . in order to determine the effective diffusivity in one direction , we take gaussian stripes in the perpendicular direction as initial puffs and use periodic boundary conditions . in this way , the puffs are as large as possible in one direction while the conclusions of the simulations remain valid . moreover , because gaussians are similarity solutions to the diffusion equation , the evolution of @xmath54 would be perfectly linear if the effect of turbulence were purely diffusive from the start .      the hw model for plasma edge turbulence , eqs .  , and the model for ideal impurities , eq .   with @xmath43 ,",
    "were simultaneously solved numerically using the schemes described in the appendix .",
    "the simulations were carried out on a doubly periodic square domain of side length @xmath59 using @xmath60 grid points .",
    "the viscosity @xmath61 and the collisional diffusivities @xmath62 and @xmath55 were set to the common value @xmath63 in all the simulations presented in this paper .",
    "we considered four different values for the adiabaticity parameter @xmath16 in the hw model : @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "as noted in the preceding section , low values of @xmath16 correspond to hydrodynamic - like regimes , whereas high values correspond to nearly adiabatic regimes . in this respect ,",
    "we regard @xmath68 as a transitional value , representative of an intermediate regime .",
    "an initial turbulent state was achieved by letting a uniform distribution of small - amplitude , random - phase modes evolve for a sufficiently long time in order to reach a quasistationary saturated turbulent regime .",
    "gaussian stripes having standard deviation @xmath66 were used as initial impurity puffs . for each value of the adiabaticity parameter and each direction , radial and poloidal , @xmath69 releases of such stripes",
    "were simulated , and the dispersion tensors were subsequently averaged .    in fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] we present snapshots of the evolution of two perpendicular stripes of impurities released into the same saturated turbulent field with @xmath68 .",

    "[ fig:1](e ) is significantly larger than the corresponding radial spread in fig .",
    "[ fig:1](f ) .",
    "hence , diffusion acts in this case faster in the poloidal direction than in the radial direction .",

    "hence , the theoretical argument explains the effect discovered in the simulations up to a slight mismatch in the regression coefficient .",
    "we emphasize that the particular features of the hw turbulence model were not used in the previous argument , the conclusions relying solely on the modeling of the dynamics of impurities and the argument of turbulent mixing .",
    "it follows that the clustering of inertial impurities in vortical structures is a generic effect , independent of the underlying instability mechanisms and the specific characteristics of the turbulence .",
    "the fact that the density of inertial impurities becomes directly correlated with the vorticity implies that impurities of positive charge cluster in positive vortices , the opposite taking place for negatively charged impurities . as previously introduced , this effect is similar to the aggregation of heavy particles in anticyclonic vortices that can take place in rotating fluids as a result of the coriolis force.@xcite in contrast with compression by the polarization drift , which yields @xmath109 , compression by the coriolis force enters the dynamics of heavy impurities in the form @xmath110 , with @xmath111 being the overall rotation .",
    "hence , aggregation in the rotating - fluid case does not necessarily lead to a linear relation between impurity density and vorticity , but can go on further to form highly concentrated clusters in the cores of anticyclonic vortices .",
    "for this reason , it has for example been suggested as a mechanism , in combination with gravitation , for planetary formation in rotating astrophysical disks.@xcite",
    "in this section we finally investigate the possible role of inertia in the radially inward pinch that concentrates impurities in the center of the plasma column in magnetic confinement devices.@xcite as a measure of the overall drift of impurities , we consider the global impurity flux @xmath112 here , we have distinguished the components respectively resulting from advection by the electric drift and by the polarization drift . in terms of these global fluxes , we define the impurity drift velocity @xmath113 and its components @xmath114 and @xmath115 by means of @xmath116 where once again @xmath117 . for a homogeneous distribution of impurities in a periodic domain ,",

    "more generally , this term sustains the radial transport of impurities in the turbulent states described by the hw model .    from the above estimates ,",
    "we are led to expect that @xmath131 is responsible for the saturation of the radial impurity drift seen in fig .",

    "consequently , when such a state is reached , the two terms dominating the evolution of the radial drift approximately cancel , and the radial drift enters a quasistationary regime . the time it takes for this regime to be reached is independent of @xmath42 , as the development of correlation is exclusively dependent on the turbulent mixing by the electric drift .",
    "in fact , the evolution of @xmath102 is approximately linear with @xmath42 within short time intervals , since in line with the discussion in sec .",
    "[ sec : cluster ] it follows that @xmath139 given that solely the density fluctuations yield net transport of impurities , the evolution of the impurity drift is likewise approximately linear with @xmath42 .",

    "[ fig:7 ] .",
    "while the arguments presented here do not yield a prediction for the quasistationary level of the radial impurity drift , they do identify the mechanism for its onset and likewise explain its scaling with the parameter @xmath42 .",
    "we emphasize that the former mechanism relies on the specific properties of the turbulence described by the hw model .",
    "nevertheless , an analogue pinch effect would appear for other driving instabilities provided that the term @xmath132 remains a source for a definite impurity drift .",
    "we have studied the transport of impurity particles in plasma edge turbulence , basing our investigations on the paradigmatic hasegawa  wakatani ( hw ) model for resistive drift - wave turbulence and a consistent passive - fluid model for the impurities .",
    "the latter model takes into account impurity - particle inertia , which enters the impurity flow velocity in the form of the polarization drift .",
    "inertia has indeed been found to play a significant role in the turbulent transport of impurities , since it gives rise to subtle yet qualitatively important compressible effects .",
    "the model equations have been investigated both theoretically and computationally .",
    "the numerical simulations were performed using the semi - lagrangian ( sl ) pseudospectral code briefly described in the appendix .",
    "although the emphasis of this paper is not on the numerical methods employed , we point out the suitability of sl schemes for the advection - dominated problems that appear in plasma turbulence . in particular , we highlight the superior stability of the sl semi - implicit scheme used here for the hw model , which is known to constitute a numerically challenging nonlinear problem .    in the case of ideal impurities , we have focused on their turbulent diffusion by the electric drift .",
    "this effect has been demonstrated by relative - diffusion analysis of the evolution of impurity puffs .",
    "the effective diffusivities of the turbulent advecting field have been calculated for several values of the adiabaticity parameter in the hw model .",
    "the resulting turbulent diffusivities are in qualitative agreement with those obtained in an earlier study based on an absolute - diffusion , test - particle approach.@xcite    in the case of inertial impurities , we have discovered that their density eventually correlates with the vorticity of the electric drift velocity .",
    "this clustering effect scales linearly with the mass  charge ratio of the impurity particles and results from compression by the polarization drift in combination with turbulent mixing .",
    "the clustering of impurities in vortices of definite sign is a generic effect in magnetized - plasma turbulence , in the sense that it is independent of the specific characteristics of the turbulence .",
    "finally , we have also found an overall radial drift of inertial impurities that scales linearly with the mass  charge ratio of the impurity particles and is inward for positively charged impurities .",
    "this anomalous pinch relies on the particular features of the turbulence described by the hw model .",
    "in contrast with other known turbulent pinches,@xcite the present pinch is neither caused by a specific magnetic field geometry nor by temperature gradients , given that our models assume a uniform magnetic field and cold impurities . consequently , our finding of a net radial drift due to impurity - particle inertia constitutes a new contribution towards the understanding of the anomalous pinch of impurities in magnetic confinement devices .",
