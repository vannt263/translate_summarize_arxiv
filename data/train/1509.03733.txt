    "core - collapse - supernovae ( cc - sne ) are believed to be the explosions that mark the end - point in the evolution of massive stars ( @xmath8 m@xmath9 ; see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "they are spectroscopically divided in different groups according mainly to the presence of the h and he lines in their optical spectra .",
    "while type ii sne show prominent h features , type i do not , and can be further subdivided , according to the presence or absence of he , as types ib and ic respectively .",
    "there are also hybrid objects which undergo a transition from being h dominated at early phases of their spectral evolution , to he dominated at later times .",
    "these are termed type iib sne .",
    "the first sn to have shown this spectral transition was sn  1987k , and its progenitor was proposed to be a star that had lost most of its hydrogen envelope before exploding @xcite .",
    "the best studied type iib sn to date is sn  1993j ( e.g. @xcite ) , that is considered the prototype of the subclass .",
    "its lc showed an early peak , followed by a rapid decline thought to be the consequence of the cooling of the progenitor s stellar envelope after shock breakout .",
    "subsequently it presented a secondary maximum attributed to input from the radioactive decay of @xmath7ni .",
    "the star that exploded as sn  1993j was detected in archival images @xcite , and its disappearance was confirmed by @xcite .",
    "two mechanisms have been proposed by which type iib sn progenitors lose part of their h envelope before exploding , namely stripping by a close companion after roche lobe overflow , and wind - driven stellar mass loss in a single star .",
    "the former scenario has gained strength over the past years , for example with the detection of signatures of the possible hot blue companion star of sn  1993j ( @xcite ; see also @xcite ) , and the modelling of a progenitor binary system and likely detection of the stellar companion of sn  2011dh @xcite . moreover , although a wolf - rayet ( wr ) wind - like spectrum was obtained for the type iib sn  2013cu a few hours after explosion @xcite , recent work has shown that the progenitor star for sn  2013cu was unlikely a wr @xcite .",
    "an important question is which of the observed properties of sne iib can be connected with the characteristics of their progenitor systems .",
    "for example , @xcite proposed that bright early luminosity from the shock - heated progenitor stellar envelope , low radio shell velocities , and thermal x - ray emission were characteristic of extended progenitors with r  @xmath10  r@xmath4 , while compact progenitors with r  @xmath11  r@xmath4 have faint early optical lcs , have high radio shell velocities and non - thermal x - ray emission .",
    "however , this link is not straightforward and needs to be revised since the type iib sne  2011dh and 2011hs present fast expanding radio shells but the hydrodynamical modelling of their lc @xcite , and in the case of sn  2011dh the detection of its progenitor in archival images @xcite and its disappearance @xcite , point to the explosion of extended stars . to further complicate the picture ,",
    "sne iib show a variety of continuum flux excess in early uv spectra @xcite .",
    "strong uv - excess suggest significant interaction between the sn ejecta and circumstellar material .    to date ,",
    "few type iib sne have been thoroughly studied since they are relatively rare events .",
    "@xcite estimated the fraction of type iib over a volume limited sample of 81 type ii sne to be @xmath12 . in this paper",
    "we present optical and near infrared ( nir ) data for the type iib sn  2011fu .",
    "sn 2011fu , with coordinates @xmath13 and @xmath14 ( j2000 ) , was discovered in a spiral arm of the galaxy ugc  1626 by f. ciabattari and e. mazzoni of the italian supernovae search project ( issp ) , on 2011 september 21.04 ut and classified by @xcite as a young type ii sn 2011 september 23.84 ut .",
    "a previous analysis of optical data of sn  2011fu was presented by @xcite , which confirmed it was a type iib sn . in this manuscript",
    "we contribute with data probing the whole sn evolution . in section [ host ]",
    "we discuss the distance , reddening , and explosion epoch of sn  2011fu . in section [ data ]",
    "we summarize our observations and the reduction process of the data . in section [ phot ]",
    "we present the optical and nir lcs of the object , while in section [ spec ] we present and discuss the spectral evolution . in section [ discussion ]",
    "we discuss the results obtained from the hydrodynamical modelling of the pseduo - bolometric lc and we compare our nebular spectra with published models for late time type iib sn spectra .",
    "finally , in section [ conclusion ] , we present the conclusions of our work .",
    "the rise to a first maximum in the _ v _ and _ r _ lcs ( see the inset of figure [ fig : apparentlcs ] ) implies that sn  2011fu was discovered very soon after explosion .",
    "in fact , models show that the evolution of the sn lc during this rise should be very fast , and lasts @xmath11  d for a number of configurations ( e.g. @xcite ) . by adopting @xmath15 as the explosion date of sn  2011fu",
    ", we obtain the best fit of the early phase of the pseudo - bolometric lc with the hydrodynamical models presented in section [ lcmodelling ] . for this reason we have chosen @xmath15 as the explosion date of sn  2011fu , which is in agreement with the discovery epoch , the last non detection of the object which was 2011 august 10 ( @xmath16 ) , the pre - discovery image taken by xing gao 2011 september 20 ( @xmath17 ) , and the classification as a young object . note that this assumed explosion date also agrees , within the uncertainties , with the explosion epoch adopted by @xcite .",
    "all phases in the rest of this manuscript are given with respect to @xmath15 .",
    "ugc  1626 is a sab(rs)c type galaxy whose recessional velocity given by the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) is @xmath18  km  s@xmath19 .",
    "we have performed measurements of the sn redshift from the narrow h@xmath20 emissions in its spectra and have obtained the same redshift as for its host galaxy , which we adopt in the rest of this paper . the redshift derived distance",
    "to ugc  1626 , also provided by ned assuming h@xmath21 km s@xmath19 mpc@xmath19 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and accounting for the virgo , great attractor and shapley infalls is @xmath24 mpc , i.e. @xmath25 mag , @xcite .",
    "the reddening in the line of sight of ugc  1626 due to the milky way is @xmath26  mag @xcite .",
    "we detect a narrow absorption likely due na i d @xmath27@xmath28 , @xmath29 at the host galaxy redshift .",
    "the equivalent width of this line is @xmath30   that using the relations for unresolved na i d given by @xcite , provides an estimate of the reddening in the host galaxy as : @xmath31  mag .",
    "in fact , a similar value of reddening due to the host galaxy is obtained using the relations of @xcite . in the rest of this manuscript",
    "we adopt @xmath32  mag as the total reddening towards sn  2011fu .",
    "we note that in @xcite the relations of @xcite were used to estimate the contribution to the reddening due to the host galaxy , and they obtained @xmath33 , which is consistent with the value we have adopted within the uncertainties .",
    "the observational follow - up data of sn 2011fu presented in this paper covers the period between a few days post discovery , until the sn disappeared behind the sun ( end of february 2012 ) .",
    "after that , one more spectrum and one epoch of _ gri _ photometric data were obtained well into the nebular phase of the sn , 2012 july 20 ut .",
    "thanks to a large collaboration between many european institutions , optical photometry and spectroscopy , as well as some nir photometric data of sn 2011fu , have been collected at several sites .",
    "some amateur data taken by f.ciabattari and e. mazzoni from italy , and xing gao from china were also included in our analysis .",
    "a summary of the characteristics of the instruments used to acquire our photometric data can be seen in table [ photometric_log ] .    the list with our spectroscopic observations and the instrumental configuration used to acquire the data is presented in table [ spectroscopic_log ] .",
    "all the data were corrected for overscan , bias , and flat - field within the iraf environment , except for data obtained at the liverpool telscope ( lt ) which were automatically reduced with the instrument specific pipeline .",
    "the instrumental magnitudes of the sn were derived via point spread function ( psf ) fitting which was done with snoopy @xcite . in the case of the _ u _ and _ u _ photometry ,",
    "the measurements were done after performing template subtraction . for all other bands , psf photometry at late time",
    "was verified by performing template subtractions and no major differences were found .",
    "a set of fifteen local stars in the sn field ( figure [ fig:11fusequence ] ) were used to trace the photometric calibration .",
    "the stellar sequence was calibrated with the zero points and colour terms derived for each site thanks to observations of landolt standards ( tables [ sequence_magsjc ] and [ sequence_magssloan ] ) and the sn magnitudes were calculated relative to these .",
    "the errors of the magnitudes of the stellar sequence were obtained as the rms deviation with respect to their mean values .",
    "given the fact that several instruments with different passbands were used to acquire our data , we performed s - corrections of our _ bvrrii _ photometry to the bessell system @xcite . in order to derive the s - correction terms we used our spectral sequence of the sn .",
    "note that we were not able to perform s - corrections to the _ u _ , _ u _ , and _ z _ band photometry given the fact that our spectra do not cover completely these passbands .",
    "the sn magnitudes together with their errors , calculated by adding in quadrature the uncertainties associated with the calibration and the psf fit , are reported in tables [ ubvri_phot ] , [ ugz_phot ] , and [ jhk_phot ] .",
    "the unfiltered photometry provided by f. ciabattari was rescaled to the _ r _ band considering that the detector sensitivity peaks at this wavelength . with the same argument",
    "the data provided by x. gao were rescaled to _",
    "note that stars 2 , 6 , 9 , 12 , and 14 from our sequence coincide with stars 2 , 1 , 4 , 3 and 5 used for photometric calibration by @xcite .",
    "the greatest difference between the two sequences is 0.1 mag found for star 2 in the _ u _ band . for the rest of the bands differences are found to be less than 0.1 mag .",
    "the nir data was reduced within iraf with the help of caindr , a package developed by jos a. acosta pulido and rafael barrena for the instrument cain3 at the tcs .",
    "the images of each specific filter were corrected for flat field , and bad pixel corrections were applied .",
    "then background images were constructed and subtracted from the science frames , and finally the images were combined taking into account the dithering pattern . similarly to the optical data , we measured the instrumental sn magnitudes by psf fitting .",
    "the sn calibration was done relative to 2-mass stars in the field ( @xcite ; see table [ sequence_magsjc ] ) .",
    "the spectra were corrected for overscan , bias , and flat - field within iraf . next they were variance - weighted extracted and wavelength calibrated with the use of arc lamp spectra .",
    "the wavelength calibration was cross - checked with respect to sky emission lines .",
    "finally a flux calibration was applied using sensitivity functions obtained from the observation of spectrophotometric standards .",
    "the flux calibration was cross - checked with the photometry of the sn at the nearest epoch .",
    "telluric lines were corrected dividing the sn spectra by telluric line spectra obtained from the spectrophotometric standards .",
    "the optical - nir lcs of sn  2011fu are presented in figure [ fig : apparentlcs ] .",
    "in addition to the data presented in the figure we obtained two epochs of sloan _",
    "g _ band data , which are listed in table [ ugz_phot ] . in the optical ,",
    "the lcs clearly present two peaks in all bands , but not in the nir since the data do not cover the early phases .",
    "the rise to primary peak in the _ v _ and _ r _ band can be seen thanks to the early time data provided by amateur astronomers ( see inset in the top - right of the figure ) .        by making low order polynomial fits to the optical lcs we have estimated the phases and magnitudes at which the minima after first peak and secondary maxima take place .",
    "the results are presented in table [ min_max_decay_rise ] .",
    "note that we obtain different absolute magnitudes at secondary peak than @xcite due to the fact that we have adopted different distance and reddening towards the host , however , our values agree within the uncertainties .",
    "we also fitted low order polynomials to the first peaks in the _ r _ and _ v _ lcs . in",
    "the _ v _ band the first peak at 16.3 mag is reached @xmath34  d after explosion while in the _ r _ band the 16.0 mag first peak is obtained @xmath35  d post explosion .",
    "we have also estimated the decline rates of the tails of the _ bvriz _ lcs ( table [ min_max_decay_rise ] ) .",
    "these rates are quite similar to those estimated for sn  2013df by @xcite , and are steeper than expected from @xmath7co decay .",
    "this is a common characteristic to stripped envelope sne ( e.g. , sn 2008ax , @xcite ) and is possibly due to increasing transparency for @xmath36 rays in their lower mass ejecta ."
