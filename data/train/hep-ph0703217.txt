    "weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) are one of the leading cold dark matter candidates , and supersymmetry provides a concrete , well - motivated , wimp candidate in the form of the lightest neutralino ( e.g. ref .",

    "constraints on , or measurements of , the wimp mass and interaction cross - section will be complementary to the information derived from collider experiments  @xcite .",
    "it is therefore pertinent to examine the accuracy with which wimp direct detection experiments will be able to measure the wimp mass , if they detect wimps .",
    "direct detection experiments could potentially measure the wimp mass via the mass dependence of either the energy spectrum  @xcite or the ` crossing energy ' at which the phase of the annual modulation signal  @xcite , due to the motion of the earth , changes sign  @xcite .",
    "the size of the annual modulation signal is small ( of order a few per - cent ) , however , and given the current exclusion limits from cdms  @xcite it is unlikely that even planned tonne scale experiments , such as supercdms  @xcite , xenon  @xcite and eureca  @xcite , will be able to accurately measure the energy dependence of the annual modulation phase  @xcite  , observed an annual modulation , which they interpret as a wimp signal  @xcite , however it appears to be possible to reconcile this with the cdms exclusion limit only by invoking ` non - standard ' wimp properties ( such as the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron couplings being different  @xcite or wimps which can scatter inelastically  @xcite ) . ] .",
    "furthermore the shape , phase and amplitude of the annual modulation signal depend sensitively on the detailed local wimp velocity distribution  @xcite whereas the shape of the differential event rate does not  @xcite , if the local wimp distribution is smooth .",
    "the mass dependence of the differential event rate  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) therefore appears to offer the best prospect , in the short to medium term at least , for probing the wimp mass using direct detection experiments .    in this paper",
    "we examine the accuracy with which a future supercdms  @xcite like direct detection experiment will be able to measure the wimp mass , given a positive detection .",

    "the direct detection differential event rate , or energy spectrum , depends on the wimp mass , its interaction with the detector nuclei and the velocity distribution of the incoming wimps .",
    "assuming purely spin - independent coupling , the event rate per unit energy , is given by ( see e.g.  @xcite ) : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the local wimp density , @xmath8 the wimp scattering cross section on the proton , @xmath9 the wimp - proton reduced mass , @xmath10 and @xmath11 the mass number and form factor of the target nuclei respectively and @xmath12 is the recoil energy of the detector nucleus .",
    "the dependence on the wimp velocity distribution is encoded in @xmath13 , which is defined as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the ( time dependent ) wimp speed distribution in the rest frame of the detector , normalized to unity and @xmath16 denotes time averaging . this is calculated from the velocity distribution in the rest frame of the galaxy , @xmath17 , via galilean transformation : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the earth s velocity with respect to the galactic rest frame .",

    "this illustrates that while eq .",
    "[ drde0 ] is a useful approximation for demonstrating the mass dependence of the energy spectrum , for concrete applications the time average of the local wimp velocity distribution should be calculated explicitly .",
    "we use monte carlo simulations to examine , for a range of detector exposures and input wimp masses , how well the wimp mass could be determined from the energies of observed wimp nuclear recoil events .",
    "our simulated detector is based on the proposed supercdms experiment  @xcite , being composed of ge with a nuclear recoil energy threshold @xmath49 .",
    "we assume that the background event rate is negligible , as is expected for this experiment located at snolab  @xcite , and that the energy resolution is perfect . for simplicity",
    "we assume that the nuclear recoil detection efficiency is independent of energy .",
    "the energy dependence of the efficiency of the current cdms experiment is relatively small ( it increases from @xmath50 at @xmath51 , the energy above which data from all detectors is analyzed , to @xmath52 at @xmath53  @xcite ) . for further discussion of these assumptions",

    "the later three exposures correspond , roughly , to a detector with mass equal to that of the 3 proposed phases of supercdms taking data for a year   with a @xmath59 detection efficiency .",
    "we assume a fixed wimp - nucleon cross - section of @xmath60 , which is just below the current exclusion limit from the cdms experiment  @xcite .",
    "since the number of events expected in a given experimental set - up is directly proportional to the cross - section , there is a straight - forward scaling to other cross - sections i.e. an exposure @xmath61 for @xmath62 is equivalent to an exposure of @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "we consider input wimp masses of @xmath65 and @xmath66 , with a maxwellian speed distribution with circular speed @xmath67 .",
    "for @xmath68 we also consider circular speeds in the range @xmath69 to @xmath70  @xcite and variations in the form of the speed distribution .",

    "@xcite : @xmath71 here @xmath72 is the number of events observed , @xmath73 are the energies of the events observed , @xmath74 is the , normalized , differential event rate and @xmath75 is the mean number of events ( @xmath74 and @xmath76 depend on @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) .",
    "we calculate the probability distribution of the maximum likelihood estimators , for each exposure and input wimp mass , by simulating @xmath79 experiments .",

    "the actual number of events for a given experiment , @xmath72 , is drawn from a poisson distribution with mean @xmath81 .",
    "we monte carlo generate @xmath72 events from the input energy spectrum , from which the maximum likelihood ( hereafter ` ml ' ) mass and cross - section are calculated .",
    "finally we plot the distribution of ml masses and cross sections . given real data from a single experiment a bayesian analysis with priors on the wimp parameters , possibly based on the results of other experiments , would be a reasonable approach .",
    "however , the question which we are trying to address ( ` for a given underlying wimp mass , how well can the mass be measured ? ' ) is best answered by simply considering the distribution of ml masses and cross - sections . since the approximations we make regarding the detector set - up and wimp distribution and cross - section are optimistic ,",
    "a real experiment would make less accurate determinations of the wimp properties .      in fig .",
    "[ m100 ] we plot the probability distribution of ml wimp masses and cross - sections for input wimp parameters @xmath68 and @xmath82 . in this case both the input energy spectrum and the maximum likelihood analysis of the simulated events are carried out assuming a maxwellian speed distribution with @xmath83 .",
    "for each experiment the extended likelihood is maximized for wimp parameters which produce an expected number of events equal to the actual number of events observed in that experiment : @xmath84 .",
    "this means that , for fixed exposure , the ml parameters are localized on curves corresponding to fixed @xmath85 . for a given experiment",
    "the position of the ml parameters on the curve depends on the energies of the observed events . for @xmath86 , @xmath87 , which is sufficiently small that the stratification of ml parameters is clearly visible and we hence plot the actual pairs of @xmath88 values . for the larger exposures",
    "the mean number of events expected is proportionately larger , the stratification is no longer visible , the ml values are better localized in the @xmath88 plane and we instead plot contours containing @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the simulated experiments .",
    "we calculate the continuous probability distribution of @xmath77 and @xmath78 by smoothing the ml values from the @xmath79 monte carlo simulations with a double gaussian kernel and summing them .",
    "the deviations of the kernel are chosen , for each exposure and underlying mass , to produce relatively smooth contours without artificially inflating the spread in the ml values .",
    "we then integrate the probability density above a threshold value and vary this threshold to find the values which enclose @xmath89 and @xmath90 of the probability distribution , and plot contours corresponding to these threshold values .",
    "for the two smallest exposures there is a significant low probability density tail at large ml masses .",
    "this is due to the weak mass dependence of the characteristic energy @xmath32 for @xmath91 . for these exposures",
    "the majority of experiments have ml masses smaller than the input mass .",
    "the likelihood analysis is not biased , the expected value of the ml mass is equal to the input mass , however there are a significant number of experiments with ml masses substantially larger than the input mass . as the exposure is increased , @xmath81 becomes large and the fractional spread in the number of events observed in each experiment becomes small .",
    "this allows the interaction cross - section ( which effectively acts as a normalization factor ) to be accurately determined .",
    "the larger number of events also allows the energy dependence of the differential event rate , and hence the mass , to be determined more accurately .    with an exposure of @xmath92 and an underlying wimp mass of @xmath68 it will be difficult to make quantitative statements about the wimp mass , beyond excluding very large or very small masses .",

    "for @xmath93 the accuracy with which the mass can be determined improves , however there is still a significant tail of experiments finding ml masses substantially larger than the underlying value .",
    "more quantitatively @xmath90 of experiments will find ml masses in the range @xmath94 . increasing the exposure by an order of magnitude",
    ", the distribution of ml masses becomes more symmetric about the input mass and the spread in the ml masses is of order @xmath95 . with a further increase in the exposure to @xmath96 the mass",
    "could be measured to an accuracy of around @xmath97 ( see the top panel of fig .",

    "@xmath119 , the weak dependence of @xmath32 on the wimp mass means that there is a large spread in the distribution of ml masses even for large exposures .",
    "there is a small , but significant , probability that an experiment will happen to observe one or more unusually large energy events and hence find a large ( @xmath120 ) ml mass . because of the extremely weak dependence of the energy spectrum on the wimp mass , the extended likelihood function also varies weakly with the mass in these cases ( where the ml mass is of order a few tev or greater , varying the wimp mass by a factor of two from the ml value only changes the 4th significant figure of the log of the extended likelihood function ) .",

    "the small increase in the expected number of events for these halo models leads to a small downwards shift in the distribution of best - fit cross - sections .",
    "since the differential event rate is directly proportional to @xmath161 , any uncertainty in the local wimp density leads straightforwardly to an equivalent uncertainty in @xmath78 .",
    "we have fixed the local wimp density to the ` standard value ' of @xmath162 .",

    "we saw above that an uncertainty in the local circular velocity translates directly into an uncertainty in the measured wimp mass .",
    "while the annual modulation signal depends sensitively on the wimp velocity distribution  @xcite , the _ time averaged _ differential event rates produced by smooth halo models are similar to that found under the standard assumption of a maxwellian velocity distribution ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "hence , as we saw above , the uncertainty in the speed distribution , for fixed @xmath144 , only leads to a small systematic error in the determination of the wimp mass ( see fig .  [ m100ns ] ) .",
    "in other words , for smooth halo models the characteristic energy of the energy spectrum , and hence the wimp mass determination , depends only weakly on the detailed kinetic energy distribution .",
    "these smooth halo models are derived by solving the collisionless boltzmann equation which assumes that the dark matter distribution has reached a steady state .",

    "the local wimp distribution , on sub milli - pc scales , may be composed of a ( a priori unknown ) number of discrete streams with unknown velocities . if this is the case it will not be possible to extract constraints on the wimp mass from an observed signal .",
    "finally we discussed the validity of the other assumptions made , namely negligible background , purely spin independent coupling , perfect energy resolution and known detector form factor .",
    "of these negligible background is probably the most significant and could in principle be taken into account by simulating the recoil spectra produced by neutrons and including the background event rate and energy spectrum in the maximum likelihood analysis .",

    "<S> we study the accuracy with which the wimp mass could be determined by a supercdms - like direct detection experiment , given optimistic assumptions about the detector set - up and wimp properties . </S>",
    "<S> we consider wimps with an interaction cross - section of @xmath0 ( just below current exclusion limits ) and assume , initially , that the local wimp velocity distribution and density are known and that the experiment has negligible background . for light wimps ( mass significantly less than that of the target nuclei ) small variations in the wimp mass lead to significant changes in the energy spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> conversely for heavy wimps the energy spectrum depends only weakly on the wimp mass </S>",
    "<S> . consequently it will be far easier to measure the wimp mass if it is light than if it is heavy . with exposures of @xmath1 and @xmath2 ( corresponding , roughly , to the three proposed phases of supercdms ) it will be possible , given the optimistic assumptions mentioned above , to measure the mass of a light wimp with an accuracy of roughly @xmath3 and @xmath4 respectively </S>",
    "<S> . these numbers increase with increasing wimp mass , and for heavy wimps , @xmath5 , even with a large exposure it will only be possible to place a lower limit on the mass . </S>",
    "<S> finally we discuss the validity of the various assumptions made , and the consequences if these assumptions are not valid . in particular if the local wimp distribution is composed of a number of discrete streams it will not be possible to determine the wimp mass .    ,    * keywords * : dark matter , dark matter detectors </S>"
