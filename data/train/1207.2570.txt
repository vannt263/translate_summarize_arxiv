    "high controllability of ultracold fermi gases enables us to study various many - body phenomena in a systematic manner@xcite . using a tunable pairing interaction associated with a feshbach resonance",
    ", we can study properties of fermi superfluids from the weak - coupling regime to the strong - coupling limit in a unified manner@xcite .",
    "introducing population imbalance to a superfluid fermi gas@xcite , one can simulate fermi superfluids discussed in various research fields , such as metallic superconductivity under an external magnetic field , and color superconductivity in a dense quark matter@xcite .",
    "the population imbalance naturally induces mismatch of fermi surfaces between ( pseudo)spin-@xmath2 and ( pseudo)spin-@xmath3 components , which suppresses the conventional @xmath4-wave superfluid state@xcite . in this case ,",
    "other pairing states , such as the fulde - ferrell - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) state@xcite and the sarma state , have been predicted@xcite",
    ".    when we deal with both the tunable interaction and population imbalance at the same time , pairing fluctuations are crucial in determining the phase diagram in terms of the interaction strength , polarization , and temperature . even in the weak - coupling regime , it has been pointed out@xcite that the fflo phase is unstable against pairing fluctuations in the absence of a lattice potential . however , despite the importance of strong - coupling effects , polarized fermi gases have been so far mainly examined within the mean - field level , so that roles of pairing fluctuations in this system have not been fully understood yet .",
    "one of the crucial reasons for this current situation is the breakdown of the strong - coupling theory developed by nozires and schmitt - rink ( nsr)@xcite in the presence of population imbalance@xcite .",
    "while the nsr theory has succeeded in explaining the bcs ( bardeen - cooper - schrieffer)-bec ( bose - einstein condensation ) crossover physics in unpolarized fermi gases , it gives negative spin susceptibility in the presence of population imbalance@xcite , which is , however , forbidden thermodynamically@xcite .    to resolve the above mentioned problem that the nsr theory possesses , we investigate a polarized fermi gas in the bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "we point out that one must carefully treat the pseudogap phenomenon associated with pairing fluctuations , as well as many - body corrections to the spin fluctuations in the presence of population imbalance . to overcome this problem , the ordinary @xmath0-matrix theory ( which has been",
    "also frequently applied to the unpolarized case ) is found to be still not enough . further extending the @xmath0-matrix theory to include higher order fluctuation effects , we obtain the expected positive spin susceptibility in the entire bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "the calculated spin susceptibility agrees well with the recent experiment on a @xmath1li fermi gas . using this extended @xmath0-matrix theory",
    ", we also determine the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath5 in a polarized fermi gas .",
    "we consider a two - component fermi gas with population imbalance ( @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the number of atoms with pseudospin @xmath8 ) .",
    "since recent experiments are all using a broad feshbach resonance , we employ the single - channel bcs model , described by the hamiltonian , @xmath9 here , @xmath10 is the creation operator of a fermi atom with momentum @xmath11 and pseudospin @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 is the kinetic energy , measured from the chemical potential @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is an atomic mass ) . when we write the chemical potential as @xmath16 , the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ h ] ) effectively describes a system under an external magnetic field @xmath17 .",

    "are , respectively , characterized by @xmath23 and @xmath24 ( where @xmath25 is the fermi momentum ) .",
    "the region @xmath26 is called the crossover region .",

    "( [ gf ] ) is expanded to o(@xmath38 ) , as @xmath39 for clarify , we call the strong - coupling theory using the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) the _ extended _",
    "@xmath0-matrix theory in this paper .",
    "the superfluid phase transition temperature @xmath5 is determined from the thouless criterion @xmath40 when the highest @xmath5 is obtained at @xmath41 , the ordinary uniform superfluid phase is realized .",
    "the fflo state , on the other hand , corresponds to the case of @xmath42 .",
    "however , since the latter state is known to be unstable against pairing fluctuations in the absence of a background lattice potential@xcite , we only consider the case of @xmath41 in this paper . as usual , we solve eq .",
    "( [ thoulessc ] ) , together with the number equations @xmath43",
    "the spin susceptibility @xmath44 is given by @xmath45 substituting the green s function given by eq .",
    "( [ gf ] ) into eq .",
    "( [ sus ] ) , we automatically obtain , not only self - energy corrections , but also vertex corrections to the spin susceptibility in a consistent manner . in the extended @xmath0-matrix theory ( where the self - energy in eq .",
    "( [ se ] ) is used ) , many - body corrections to the spin susceptibility ( @xmath46 ) are diagrammatically given by the first line in fig.[fig1 ] . here",
    ", the first term ( a1 ) involves many - body corrections to @xmath44 through the density of states @xmath47 .",
    "that is , noting that the spin susceptibility @xmath44 is deeply related to @xmath47 at the fermi level ( @xmath48 ) , when pairing fluctuations induce the pseudogap in @xmath47 above @xmath5 , @xmath44 is also suppressed due to the suppression of @xmath47 around @xmath48 . to understand the role of ( a2 ) , ( a3 ) and higher order diagrams in fig.[fig1 ] , it is convenient to approximate @xmath49 to the lowest - order contribution @xmath18 .",
    "then , the sum of these diagrams are found to be similar to the random - phase approximation ( rpa ) , as @xmath50 where @xmath51 is given by the diagram ( a1 ) in fig.[fig1 ] .    when one uses the nsr green s function @xmath52 in eq .",
    "( [ sus ] ) , the resulting spin susceptibility ( @xmath53 ) is diagrammatically described by the third line in fig.[fig1 ] . reflecting that the self - energy is only taken into account to @xmath54 , the diagram ( a1 ) is now approximated to ( c1 ) and ( c2 ) . in this regard",
    ", we note that the nsr green s function @xmath55 is known to overestimate the magnitude of the pseudogap@xcite , leading to the unphysical _ negative _ density of states around the fermi level in the bcs - bec crossover region . because of this",
    ", the suppression of the spin susceptibility by the pseudogap effect is also overestimated in @xmath56 , leading to the negative spin susceptibility , as shown in fig.[fig2 ] . in the strong - coupling bec limit , one finds@xcite @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the susceptibility of a free fermi gas .",
    "@xmath59^{-1 } $ ] and @xmath60 is the superfluid phase transition temperature in the bec limit ( where @xmath61 is the fermi temperature ) .",
    "the second term in eq . ( [ afx ] ) just arises from the diagram ( c2 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , which is related to fluctuation corrections to the density of states@xcite . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , this term is the origin of the negative spin susceptibility in the bec regime .",
    "the problem of the negative density of states is absent in the ordinary @xmath0-matrix theory ( where eq .",
    "( [ set ] ) is used)@xcite . in this case , the ( a1)-type diagram in fig.[fig1 ] is correctly included as ( b1 ) in the second line of fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "however , when we evaluate @xmath44 based on this theory ( @xmath62 ) , although the situation becomes much better than the nsr result , @xmath63 still becomes negative for @xmath64 .",
    "( see the inset in fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "this is because the rpa - type series in the extended @xmath0-matrix theory is truncated at the first order ( ( b2 ) in fig.[fig2 ] ) in the ordinary @xmath0-matrix theory .",
    "evaluating @xmath63 by approximating @xmath49 to @xmath18 , one obtains @xmath65 while eq.([susetma ] ) is always positive , eq.([sustma ] ) becomes negative when @xmath66 .",
    "the above analyses clearly indicate that one needs to carefully treat the pseudogap effect and the rpa - type many - body corrections to the spin susceptibility in the presence of population imbalance .",
    "since they are both correctly treated in our extended @xmath0-matrix theory , the calculated spin susceptibility @xmath67 is positive in the entire bcs - bec crossover . as shown in fig.[fig2 ] , @xmath67 gradually decreases with increasing the interaction strength , and almost vanishes when @xmath68 , because the spin degrees of freedom almost dies out due to the formation of tightly binding singlet pairs in the bec regime .",
    "we compare our theoretical result with the recent experiment on @xmath1li@xcite in fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "the calculated spin susceptibility @xmath67 well agrees with the observed susceptibility in the normal state ( the left side of the vertical dotted line ) .",
    "we emphasize that there is no fitting parameter in obtaining fig.[fig3 ] .",
    "so far , we have discussed spin susceptibility , which is obtained in the zero polarization limit ( @xmath69 ) . here , we briefly consider the case of finite polarization .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the phase diagram of a polarized fermi gas in terms of the interaction strength , polarization @xmath70 , and the temperature . in the weak - coupling bcs regime",
    ", @xmath5 vanishes at a critical polarization @xmath71 . the magnitude of @xmath71 increases , as one passes through the bcs - bec crossover region . in the bec regime",
    ", one finds @xmath72 .",
    "we briefly note that , although we have only considered the second order phase transition by using the thouless criterion in fig.[fig4 ] , the first order transition may exist below @xmath71@xcite . to examine the first order phase transition of a polarized fermi gas",
    ", one needs to take into account the possibility of phase separation between the paired molecules and fully polarized fermi atoms , which remains as our future problem .",
    "to summarize , we have investigated an ultracold fermi gas with population imbalance .",
    "we clarified that the breakdown of the nsr and @xmath0-matrix theories in the presence of population imbalance can be eliminated by carefully treating the pseudogap effects and the rpa - type many - body corrections to the spin susceptibility .",
    "the resulting extended @xmath0-matrix theory gives the expected positive spin susceptibility in the entire bcs - bec crossover region .",
    "the calculated spin susceptibility well agrees with the recent experiment on a @xmath1li fermi gas . since polarized fermi gases are deeply related to metallic superconductivity under an external magnetic field",
