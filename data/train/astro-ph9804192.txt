    "in unified models of active galactic nuclei with spherically symmetric blr the width distribution of the broad emission lines can not be accounted for by luminosity dependence alone .",
    "plots of line width versus continuum luminosity have a large scatter and show no significant correlation @xcite .",
    "there is , however , growing evidence that the broad line region ( blr ) is not spherical , but axisymmetric .    1",
    ".   observed samples of agn @xcite suggest relations between line widths and r , the ratio of core to lobe dominance .",
    "other samples @xcite find relations between line widths and @xmath2 , the continuum slope parameter from the optical to x  ray bands .",
    "both of these parameters have some viewing angle dependence .",
    "the continuum and line light curves of some active nuclei , eg 3c390.3 @xcite , are most naturally interpreted in terms of a disc - like line emission region .",
    "it has also been suggested that some double peaked line profiles arise from discs ( eg arp 102b ) although the interpretation in these cases is not so clear when time variability is taken into account .",
    "3 .   several axisymmetric disc - wind models , such as those of cassidy & raine , chaing & murray and emmering , blandford & shlosman have been proposed and models of this type are gaining support from evidence for winds @xcite .",
    "these will naturally predict some viewing angle dependence of line width .",
    "it should be noted that osterbrock showed that a deficit of systems with narrower lines ruled out pure disc models , but such objections do not necessarily apply to axisymmetric models in general .    in this paper",
    "we shall adopt a simple dependence of line width on both viewing angle and luminosity . then :    1 .",
    "we obtain a reasonable fit to the distribution of line widths .",
    "2 .   given the balwin relation between line and continuum luminosity we predict a relation between line width and equivalent width compatible with the observed trend .",
    "the scatter on this relation is attributed to angular dependence .",
    "we discuss how the width distribution can be used to test models of the blr .",
    "if the blr is indeed axisymmetric , we show how the line width distribution can be used , in principle , to determine cosmological parameters .",
    "for an axisymmetric blr we can expand the line width as a function of angle @xmath3 between the axis and the line of sight in a fourier series @xmath4 with the cosine terms set to zero for symmetry about @xmath5 .",
    "however the line widths do not appear to be a function of angle only as it is difficult to obtain the range of widths required in an uncontrived way .",
    "also , observations of variable sources such as ngc 4151 @xcite show that line width is luminosity dependent .",
    "however , there is no reason to assume that the variation in line width in one source should be the same as that between sources at different luminosities .",
    "in fact in the case of line equivalent widths this is definitely not the case @xcite .",
    "therefore we introduce the luminosity dependence as another independent variable .",
    "thus , we consider @xmath6 to depend on angle and luminosity with @xmath7 , which we expand as @xmath8 note that in principle @xmath9 could depend on @xmath10 , but we shall take it to be a constant for a given line .",
    "to lowest non - trivial order we terminate the series at @xmath11 and write @xmath12 , @xmath13 thus , we arrive at our proposed model : @xmath14 more precisely , we suggest that line width at half maximum ( fwhm ) , @xmath15 km s@xmath1 , is related to the b band luminosity , in units of @xmath16 erg s@xmath1 , and viewing angle as follows @xmath17    to produce the line width distribution we combine the above relation with statistical information about the number of systems at each viewing angle and each luminosity .",
    "the number of systems , @xmath18 , at each viewing angle satisfies @xmath19 the angle @xmath20 takes account of the obscuring material in the unified picture that prevents direct sight of the blr at large inclinations .",
    "this value will vary between systems and may be correlated with luminosity .",
    "realistic unified models probably have @xmath21 but we shall take @xmath22 constant , since this is all that can be justified by current data .",
    "the number of systems at each luminosity is found from the luminosity function @xmath23 .",
    "we use a broken power law fit to the luminosity function given in boyle , shanks and peterson to give @xmath24 the number of systems at each width , @xmath25 , is given by @xmath26 wher the @xmath27  function restricts the integral over luminosity and angle to systems with width @xmath15 . thus evaluating the angular integral , we obtain @xmath28 to compute this integral numerically we restrict @xmath29 to the range @xmath30 .      to complete the picture we introduce the parameter @xmath31 for the baldwin relation between the equivalent width ( ew ) of a line and the blue band continuum luminosity of the active nucleus : @xmath32 from the observational data sets we can obtain a relation between the ew and fwhm of a line of the form @xmath33 using our previous relation , @xmath34 , we see @xmath35 with a scatter deriving from the angular dependence .",
    "thus , any two of @xmath9 , @xmath31 or @xmath36 should determine the third .",
    "in particular , given the baldwin relation and a fit to @xmath25 , determining @xmath9 , we predict the slope of the correlations between fwhm and ew ( with a scatter from angular dependence ) .",
    "we have investigated the civ @xmath371549 , mgii @xmath372798 and h@xmath38 lines using data from wills et al .  , brotherton et al . , wilkes and puchnarewicz et al .  .",
    "fig.[c4lwd ]  shows the observed width distribution in civ for three samples with a theoretical curve drawn for comparison using @xmath39 and the other parameters as shown in table 1 .",
    "this value for @xmath20 is chosen to give a reasonable fit for the three emission lines simultaneously .",
    "this value is larger than expected for the standard unified model of agn but consistent with the unified model of cassidy and raine .",
    "the position of the peak of the distribution is dependent mostly on @xmath40 and @xmath20 with @xmath9 determining the spread of the distribution .",
    "setting @xmath41 gives a pure disc model and increases the predicted number of narrower lined systems .",
    "setting @xmath42 gives a spherically symmetric blr model and the distribution is a narrow peak centred around @xmath43 ( assuming @xmath9 is small ) .",
    "the wilkes data , taken from the parkes flat spectrum survey , is biased towards face on objects , which this model predicts would give a peak in the distribution at lower velocity . the data in wills et al .  and brotherton et al .",
    "is biased towards higher luminosity objects which may explain the lack of narrower lined systems in the lower figure .",
    "fig.[rixosfits ] shows similar fits to mgii and h@xmath31 .    .model",
    "parameters used to fit the observed samples for 3 emission lines .",
    "value of @xmath31 taken from peterson ( 1997 ) for civ and from puchnarewicz , e.m .",
    "( private communication ) for mgii and h@xmath31 [ cols=\"^ , > , > , > , > \" , ]     [ parameters ]",
    "fig.[wewplots ] shows the corresponding ew ",
    "fwhm relations obtained from the model . the slopes , from table [ parameters ] , are @xmath44 for civ , mgii and h@xmath31 respectively compared with @xmath450.25 for civ ( from inspection of wills et al . ) , 1.6@xmath460.4 for mgii and 0.6@xmath46 0.4 for h@xmath31 ( puchnarewicz , e.m . , private communication ) .",
    "the sharp edge to the data in these figures will be disrupted by time variability in the source luminosity since the baldwin relation in a single variable source does not have the same slope as the relation between different sources @xcite .",
    "whilst it is perhaps unexpected for the mgii emission line distribution to be fitted with @xmath47 , this is necessary for consistency with the observed baldwin effect ( @xmath48 ) amd the positive correlation between ew and fwhm ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "although a positive @xmath9 gives a similar distribution curve , @xmath50 is physically more reasonable as it corresponds to a decrease in mg@xmath51 ions with increasing ionization parameter .",
    "systems which have comparably wide mgii and civ lines are rare and seem to occur at low luminosity ( e.g. ngc 4151 ) .",
    "more commonly the widths @xmath52 satisfy @xmath53 . presumably at high luminosity",
    "the low ionization emission lines are absent from the inner , faster moving , blr material .",
    "certainly at higher luminosity ( e.g. ngc 5548 ) reverberation mapping shows mgii to come predominantly from larger radii @xcite .",
    "narrow lined systems ( fwhm@xmath54 km s@xmath1 ) appear to be under - represented in the samples .",
    "this may be a resolution or a selection effect . however a pure disc model ( @xmath41 ) would predict larger numbers of such systems .",
    "this led osterbrock to rule out disc models for the blr .",
    "however , it is as yet unclear where the narrow line seyfert 1 class of objects fits into the scheme .",
    "recent analysis of these systems @xcite shows the existence of a broad component to the narrow lines suggesting that the blr is not obscured in these sources , which may therefore provide a class of `` broad lined '' objects with small fwhm .",
    "current axisymmetric models of the blr include the dual winds picture @xcite , the disc wind model @xcite and the magnetic wind model @xcite .",
    "the dual winds model and the disc wind model both have an angular dependence of fwhm on viewing angle which is consistent with our model ( fig.[sincurves ] ) .",
    "examination of figure 6 in emmering et al .   suggests that in the magnetic wind model the fwhm reduces as viewing angle increases .",
    "whilst this is in the opposite sense to the other models we can still obtain the line width distribution using equation ( [ vileqtn ] ) with @xmath55 and so can not rule out the magnetic winds model .",
    "however where correlations exist between fwhm and r or @xmath56 , they suggest that @xmath15 increases with @xmath3 , hence @xmath57",
    ". it may be possible to discriminate between the models by consideration of the predicted value of @xmath9 .",
    "since this analysis enables us to remove statistically the scatter in the luminosity  fwhm relation for agn it has obvious applications to cosmology once large data sets of fwhm become available .",
    "note that the observed distribution of line widths is itself independent of any cosmological model .",
    "if other methods can be used to determine the line of sight to individual objects these too could then be used for cosmology . in",
    "further work we expect to include a redshift dependence in the luminosity function @xmath58 @xcite with @xmath59 , to provide a new method of determining @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "we conclude that the simple picture we have presented here accounts for the scatter in fwhm versus luminosity , accounts for the distribution of fwhm , and relates the trend in the ew with fwhm to the baldwin relation . this may be useful as a diagnostic tool in discriminating between disc - wind models .",
    "the analysis has applications as a cosmological tool particularly as measurement of line widths is independent of any cosmological model .",
