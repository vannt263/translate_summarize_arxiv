    "a number of the trivalent lanthanides undergo first order phase transitions under pressure that are characterized by unusually large volume changes , ce ( 15%),@xcite pr ( 9%),@xcite gd ( 5%),@xcite and dy ( 6%).@xcite these `` volume collapse '' transitions are believed to be caused by changes in the degree of @xmath3 electron correlation from strongly correlated ( localized ) at pressures below the transitions to more weakly correlated ( itinerant ) above.@xcite associated with these two regimes are differences in physical properties , with high - symmetry crystal structures below the collapse transitions characteristic of metals without @xmath7 electrons , and low - symmetry early - actinide - like structures at pressures above , suggesting a greater participation of @xmath7 electrons in the bonding .",
    "the magnetic susceptibility is of curie - weiss character in the localized regime characteristic of hund s rules @xmath3 moments , and is believed to become temperature independent similar to pauli paramagnetism in the itinerant regime .",
    "the latter behavior has actually been observed only for the collapsed @xmath6 phase of ce , but is inferred for the other lanthanides based on analogies to the actinides .",
    "in contrast to these apparently general trends , it has been recently shown that nd reaches the characteristic itinerant @xmath6-u structure in a relatively continuous fashion without any phase transitions of unusually large volume change,@xcite while in an analogous actinide system , am is noted to undergo two collapse transitions.@xcite it would therefore appear that the evolution from localized to itinerant character in these @xmath7 electron metals occurs more generally in a continuous manner which may or may not be accelerated by one or more large - volume - change collapse transitions .",
    "it was demonstrated many years ago that the volume collapse transitions in the lanthanides and actinides do not involve the promotion of electrons from @xmath7 to other states , and it was argued that these metals were instead undergoing mott transitions in their respective @xmath3 and @xmath8 electron systems.@xcite local density approximate ( lda ) calculations modified to enable orbital polarization,@xcite to include the self - interaction correction,@xcite and to explicitly incorporate the hubbard repulsion @xmath9,@xcite appear to provide such transitions for ce and pr .",
    "they describe large - volume magnetically - ordered solutions with hubbard split @xmath3 bands which become unstable under compression to paramagnetic solutions where these bands are grouped near the fermi level .",
    "it has been suggested , however , that the rather abrupt delocalization of these modified - lda transitions is an artifact of the static - mean - field nature of these techniques , and that a correlated solution would allow a continuous transfer of @xmath7 spectral weight between the hubbard side bands and the fermi level over an extended volume range.@xcite this is the case for the kondo - volume collapse model of the ce transition , based on a many - body solution of the anderson impurity model , which identifies kondo - like screening of the local moment as the driving force for the transition.@xcite more realistic calculations which combine lda with correlated dynamical mean field theory ( dmft),@xcite so called lda+dmft,@xcite generally corroborate these characteristics for ce,@xcite and the same technique has been applied to the actinides.@xcite    beyond the specific case of ce , a more general understanding of the lanthanide volume - collapse transitions or their absence may come from putting them in context of the extended evolution from localized to itinerant character which occurs as these materials are compressed . as a step in this direction , the present paper reports lda+dmft calculations over a wide range of volume for ce ( @xmath0 ) , pr ( @xmath1 ) , and nd ( @xmath2 ) , the last as mentioned being notable for the absence of a volume collapse transition .",
    "these calculations have been carried out as in earlier work on ce,@xcite except that the spin - orbit interaction is now incorporated .",
    "they also assume a face centered cubic ( fcc ) structure throughout , although lda estimates of the structural energy differences suggest these are significantly smaller than the relevant contributions to the correlation energy , which may then be discussed in terms of their volume dependence as more important leading order effects .",
    "the trivalent lanthanides follow a general structural sequence under pressure , namely hcp @xmath10 sm - type @xmath10 dhcp @xmath10 fcc @xmath10 dfcc , where these abbreviations are for hexagonal close packed ( hcp ) , double hcp ( dhcp ) , and distorted fcc ( dfcc).@xcite these are all just different stacking variants within the family of close packed structures , except for dfcc , a soft l - point phonon distortion of fcc,@xcite a phase which only ce does not assume .",
    "the heaviest lanthanides traverse the full sequence , whereas the lighter ones begin part way , e.g. , ce , pr , and nd are all dhcp at ambient conditions , although fcc ce is also metastable there . since the same sequence is seen in y which has no nearby @xmath7 states,@xcite and is theoretically understood to depend on the @xmath11 occupancy,@xcite it would appear to have no relation whatsoever with the @xmath7 electrons , which are then presumed to be fully localized . indeed , in the present work we find evidence for fully formed hund s rules moments and little @xmath3 spectral weight at the fermi level throughout the experimentally observed stability field of the fcc phases ( @xmath4 for ce ) , and for lower pressures .",
    "further compression takes ce through a 15% volume collapse from the @xmath4 ( fcc ) to the @xmath6 ( also fcc ) phase , while pr undergoes a 9% collapse from the dfcc to an @xmath6-u structure , and nd passes from the dfcc through two other low - symmetry structures before also reaching @xmath6-u , however , without any large volume changes .",
    "the present work finds a variety of signatures to accompany this compression regime : substantial deviation of the moments away from their hund s rules values , rapid growth in @xmath3 spectral weight at the fermi level ( the kondo resonance ) at the expense of the hubbard side bands , an associated softness in the total energy , and quenching of the spin orbit due to the mixed-@xmath12 character of the kondo resonance versus the predominant @xmath5 lower hubbard band .",
    "the most dramatic changes in these signatures for the case of ce _ coincide _ with the two - phase region in the @xmath4@xmath6 transition .",
    "this behavior was observed in earlier work on ce,@xcite and is consistent with the kondo volume collapse scenario.@xcite    in regard to signatures in the total energy , a unique feature of the kondo volume collapse model is the assertion that the @xmath4@xmath6 transition is driven by a rapid drop in entropy from the @xmath4 to the @xmath6 side , reflecting screening of the @xmath3 moments .",
    "the transition therefore need not occur at @xmath13,@xcite as has been documented for ce alloys,@xcite implying a featureless @xmath13 total energy .",
    "nevertheless , due to the interrelationships between the different thermodynamic functions , and even though it is the free energy which actually determines the phase transition , the _ finite-_@xmath14 total energy should show an associated softening in the vicinity of the phase transition , and is therefore a useful diagnostic.@xcite    the present work finds the same signatures for compressed pr and nd , however , their most dramatic change takes place over the volume range where the dfcc phase is experimentally observed , suggesting this phase is of transitional character and not the end member of the localized trivalent lanthanide sequence as has been assumed . only on further compression is pr observed to collapse into the @xmath6-u structure , and as noted nd has no collapse .",
    "an important difference among the lanthanides is that they become more localized with increasing atomic number , due to the increased but incompletely screened nuclear charge .",
    "this is evident in the present work by the offset of the concurrent correlation - related signatures to smaller volumes from ce to pr and then to nd .",
    "one consequence is that the softening effect in the energy associated with the growing kondo resonance must compete with the remaining , dominant part of the energy which has a curvature that grows ever larger with decreasing volume .",
    "while a region of negative bulk modulus is required for an isostructural transition as in ce , it may be more generally that a low bulk modulus favors larger volume changes in structural phase transitions , which would then be consistent with the decreasing size of the collapse from 15% ( ce ) , to 9% ( pr ) , to none ( nd ) . the observed collapse transitions in gd and dy",
    "would then appear inconsistent ; however , these involve filling of the @xmath15 subshell which complicates matters .    in the remainder of this paper , the theoretical methods are reviewed in sec .",

    "an essential component of the dmft method is solution of an auxiliary impurity problem which is achieved here by a quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) algorithm.@xcite the present calculations have been carried out as described in previous work for ce,@xcite except that the spin - orbit interaction has now been added and a broader set of materials considered . in the remainder of this section we give a brief review of the method , various computational details , and calculation of the moment .",

    "( [ etoteqn ] ) is a reminder of the still fairly new and evolving nature of the lda+dmft method .",

    "a step towards answering many of these questions is simply to provide more quantitative tests against experiment of lda+dmft implementations with clearly stated approximations , and this is the spirit of the present work .      while the matrices @xmath35 , @xmath27 , and @xmath58 in eq .  ( [ latgrneqn ] ) are all @xmath28 , it is customary to take @xmath58 non - zero only within the interacting or @xmath59 @xmath7-@xmath7 block , which permits the same reduction in the impurity problem itself .",
    "even so , one must still determine seven distinct functions of @xmath60 to fill out @xmath31 even for the full cubic point group,@xcite and more otherwise .",
    "on the other hand , if we ignore crystal field , then the @xmath7-@xmath7 self - energy becomes @xmath61 and we need only find functions for the two spin - orbit states @xmath5 and @xmath42 .",
    "this is an excellent approximation over most of the volume range studied here , including the volume - collapse regions , where the crystal field splitting ranges from about 1 to 10% of the spin - orbit splitting . at the very smallest volumes considered here , this ratio approaches 50% , however , it is to be emphasized this omission is only in the self - energy , and all such effects are reflected in @xmath27 where hybridization dominates anyway . in practice",
    "we input a bath green function of similar structure , @xmath62 , into the qmc and then improve statistical uncertainties by averaging over the six @xmath5 and eight @xmath42 states in determining the output @xmath63 .",

    "the success of lda calculations for the structural parameters in these phases for ce as well as the light actinides is also well known.@xcite    this work has also included a detailed quantitative comparison between the present lda+dmft results and experiment for the total energies and pressures of ce , pr , and nd . the comparison is encouraging , and serves to corroborate such theoretical observations as the systematic offset of kondo - like correlation signatures to smaller volume for increasing atomic number in these three lanthanides .",
    "there are also clear deficiencies , most notably the need to include intraatomic exchange , ideally in its full rotationally invariant form to enable rigorous calculation of the hund s rules moments in general cases .",
    "the need for accurate lda+dmft structural energy differences is also apparent .",
    "these improvements as well as making the lda and dmft parts mutually self - consistent will require a self - energy treatment that is both more precise and considerably less expensive , which unfortunately is likely to require giving up some of the rigor of the present qmc approach .",

    "<S> subsequent compression for all three lanthanides brings about significant deviation of the moments from their hund s rules values , a growing kondo resonance at the fermi level , an associated softening in the total energy , and quenching of the spin orbit since the kondo resonance is of mixed spin - orbit character while the lower hubbard band is predominantly @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> while the most dramatic changes for ce occur within the two - phase region of the @xmath4@xmath6 volume collapse transition , as found in earlier work , those for pr and nd occur within the volume range of the experimentally observed distorted fcc ( dfcc ) phase , which is therefore seen here as transitional and not part of the localized trivalent lanthanide sequence . </S>",
    "<S> the experimentally observed collapse to the @xmath6-u structure in pr occurs only on further compression , and no such collapse is found in nd . </S>",
    "<S> these lanthanides start closer to the localized limit for increasing atomic number , and so the theoretical signatures noted above are also offset to smaller volume as well , which is possibly related to the measured systematics of the size of the volume collapse being 15% , 9% , and none for ce , pr , and nd , respectively . </S>",
