    "wireless communication , remarkable for its low energy consumption and low product cost , is an emerging technology which is widely used@xcite .",

    "rfid is promoted by its longevity , efficacy , and energy efficiency .",
    "it is believed that rfid will become one of the most crucial techniques to realize the internet of things ( iot)@xcite , which allows objects to be sensed and creates more efficient interactions between the physical world and computer - based systems .    as a contactless technology in a short range ,",
    "rfid systems are expected to fulfill the aim of reducing handling time despite the augment of data stored in rfid tags@xcite . concerning this higher expectation of the data rate and data reliability for novel rfid applications",
    ", the implementation of the multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) scheme appears to be effective and promising@xcite , which attracts considerable research interests@xcite .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that adopting multiple antennas can extend the coverage of backscatter rfid systems and improve system capacity under the spatial multiplexing configuration .",
    "furthermore , the authors in @xcite show that multi - antenna techniques can significantly improve the data reliability of the rfid system .",
    "the space - time coding scheme is explored in @xcite for mimo rfid backscatter systems .",
    "apart from the above analytical studies , several real experiments concerning multi - antenna rfid tags have also been conducted@xcite .",
    "the measurement results in @xcite show that read range can be improved when multiple antennas , instead of a single antenna , are equipped at the rfid tag .",
    "in addition , the authors in @xcite propose a method for channel measurements in mimo rfid systems .",
    "the authors in @xcite showcase two multi - antenna techniques for rfid tags operating at 5.8 ghz . the mimo scheme has been extensively investigated and recognized as an efficient approach to further extending the information - carrying ability of rfid @xcite .",
    "due to the widespread deployment of rfid tags , the privacy concern for users , such as clandestine physical tracking and personal information protecting , also makes a great challenge to the design of rfid systems , because the transmission is vulnerable to eavesdropping due to the broadcast nature of backscatter communication @xcite .",
    "most of previous works concerning rfid security issues mainly focus on lightweight cryptography such as in@xcite . however , they still have some restrictions on the secret key generation and distribution from eavesdropping and practical limitations in terms of size , cost , and computation@xcite . fortunately , in recent years physical layer security ( pls ) , as an alternative or complement to cryptography , has drawn considerable attention in strengthening the security of wireless communications since perfect secrecy is provided .",
    "the theoretical basis for pls approaches lies in the notion of the _ secrecy capacity / rate _ , which was pioneered by wyner in @xcite .",
    "since then , wealth of relevant research has achieved a significant success in the security of conventional wireless communication systems@xcite .",
    "the main idea of pls approaches , in addition to exploiting the randomness inherent to wireless channels@xcite , is to manually construct _ equivalent channels _ via signal design and power allocation such that the superiority of the equivalent legitimate channel to the equivalent wiretap channel can be established@xcite .",
    "one of promising approaches is to send an artificially generated noise to deteriorate the channel condition of eavesdroppers .",
    "this conception of applying artificial noise ( an ) to enhance the secure transmission is first introduced in @xcite , and it is further studied in @xcite .",
    "these studies have also been generalized to the cooperative relay system@xcite . however , there is only little work to study the security of backscatter systems from the perspective of pls . in @xcite ,",
    "a physical layer noise injection scheme is proposed to strengthen the security of backscatter wireless systems under a single - input single - output ( siso ) system setting where all terminals employ a single antenna , and it is shown that the proposed approach yields significant performance gains . to the best of our knowledge",
    ", no work has been done on the pls of a mimo backscatter system , even though the mimo technique is promising in enhancing the security due to extra spatial degrees of freedom provided by multiple antennas@xcite .",
    "note that the pls approaches for the conventional mimo system can not be directly used into the mimo backscatter system due to the following two reasons .",
    "for one thing , the channel model of the mimo backscatter system is quite different from the conventional one and usually is modeled as the so - called _ dyadic backscatter channel _ @xcite , which makes it hard to formulate the considered security problem . for another thing , the passive backscatter system is typically resource - constrained and thus requires low - complexity algorithms in practice .",
    "particularly , the trade - off between secrecy performance and computational complexity should be taken into account in the algorithm design of the mimo backscatter system .",
    "based on the above observations , in this paper we focus on solving the security issues of a mimo rfid system from the perspective of pls , wherein we take full account of the resource - constrained nature of rfid devices .",
    "the novelty and main contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows :    1 .",
    "the mimo backscatter wireless communication is studied from the perspective of pls for the first time and a noise - injection precoding strategy is proposed to strengthen the security of the system .",
    "the _ alternating optimization _ ( ao ) method and the _ sequential parametric convex approximation _ ( spca ) method are , respectively , invoked to tackle the non - convex _ secrecy rate maximization _ ( srm ) problem .",
    "furthermore , we show an interesting fact that the two methods are actually equivalent for our problem .",
    "3 .   particularly , a custom - designed algorithm based on _ projected gradient _",
    "( pg ) is proposed for fast implementation , which is especially beneficial to the resource - constrained rfid device .",
    "4 .   as a complement , the case where the tag has only a single antenna is studied , and the global optimal solution can be obtained by one - dimensional search . moreover ,",
    "a nullspace an design in this case is further proposed , and it is shown in the simulations that this scheme obtains the secrecy rate which is close to the optimal one and enjoys an extremely low computational complexity .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_model ] , we present the system model and develop the formulation for the achievable secrecy rate of a mimo rfid backscatter system . in section [ sec_sol ] ,",

    ", we use the terms `` reader '' and `` tag '' as commonly used in rfid systems hereinafter .    the basic idea of realizing the rfid backscatter wireless communication is as follows :",
    "first , the reader transmits a continuous carrier wave ( cw ) to power up the tag .",
    "then , the passive tag reflects back the cw signal by changing the different impedance loads of its antennas according to its stored secret information such as identification data .",
    "this procedure can be regarded as a backscatter modulation , where the secret information , to be transmitted from the tag to the reader , is modulated on the reflected cw signal by the tag .",

    ", the reader continuously transmits a cw signal to power up the tag and concurrently receives the echoed back signal modulated by the tag , namely , it works in a full - duplex mode .",

    ", we consider a common scenario employed in @xcite that the signaling matrix @xmath33 takes the form of a diagonal matrix , given by @xmath34 we assume that the elements in vector @xmath35 are i.i.d . and",

    ", we propose a noise - injection precoding scheme to create additional interference at the eavesdropper and thus to strengthen the security of the system .",

    "<S> backscatter wireless communication is an emerging technique widely used in low - cost and low - power wireless systems , especially in passive radio frequency identification ( rfid ) systems . </S>",
    "<S> recently , the requirement of high data rates , data reliability , and security drives the development of rfid systems , which motivates our investigation on the physical layer security of a multiple - input multiple - output ( mimo ) rfid system . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we propose a noise - injection precoding strategy to safeguard the system security with the resource - constrained nature of the backscatter system taken into consideration . </S>",
    "<S> we first consider a multi - antenna rfid tag case and investigate the secrecy rate maximization ( srm ) problem by jointly optimizing the energy supply power and the precoding matrix of the injected artificial noise at the rfid reader . </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the alternating optimization method and the sequential parametric convex approximation method , respectively , to tackle the non - convex srm problem and show an interesting fact that the two methods are actually equivalent for our srm problem with the convergence of a karush - kuhn - tucker ( kkt ) point . to facilitate the practical implementation for resource - constrained rfid devices , we propose a fast algorithm based on projected gradient . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider a single - antenna rfid tag case and develop a low - complexity algorithm which yields the global optimal solution . </S>",
    "<S> simulation results show the superiority of our proposed algorithms in terms of the secrecy rate and computational complexity .    </S>",
