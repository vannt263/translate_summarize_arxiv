    "in lattice qcd simulations with periodic boundary conditions , the autocorrelation time of the topological charge can be rather large .",
    "in particular , this is the case for lattice spacings @xmath0 , where the topological charge is typically frozen @xcite . for",
    "chirally symmetric quark actions , such a freezing takes place also at much coarser lattice spacings ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) . to overcome this problem ,",
    "simulations with open boundary conditions have been advocated @xcite . however , even though promising , they might not always be applicable .",
    "for example , when using a mixed action setup with light overlap valence and corresponding wilson sea quarks , it is extremely difficult to take the continuum limit correctly , since exact zero modes of the valence dirac operator are not compensated by the sea quark determinant @xcite .",
    "a possible solution to this problem is to use topology conserving actions ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) and to simulate only the topological sector @xmath1 , where zero modes are absent ( in stochastic configurations ) .    in this work ,",
    "we use periodic boundary conditions and explore two methods to extract the topological susceptibility from simulations confined to a single topological sector .",
    "the first one is the aoki - fukaya - hashimoto - onogi ( afho ) method @xcite , which allows for the extraction of the topological susceptibility from the correlation function of the topological charge density .",
    "this method has already been studied in several models and theories including su(2 ) yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the second approach is the slab method , where the topological susceptibility is determined from computations of the topological charge on spacetime subvolumes .",
    "the method was sketched in @xcite and has recently been tested in lower dimensional models @xcite .",
    "we will present numerical tests for two - flavor qcd using both methods .",
    "to be able to verify that the fixed topology methods yield correct results , we have first computed the topological susceptibility at unfixed topology .    to this end",
    "we have generated 10000 gauge link configurations using two - flavor wilson twisted mass lattice qcd ( cf .",
    "@xcite for details regarding the simulation code ) .",
    "the lattice spacing is @xmath3 , the pion mass is @xmath4 and the lattice volume is @xmath5 .    on each gauge link configuration",
    ", the topological charge has been computed using the field strength definition ( cf .",
    "e.g.  @xcite ) , but with the gradient flow instead of cooling to reduce uv - fluctuations . moreover",
    ", the topological charge has been renormalized by locally minimizing @xmath6 with respect to @xmath7 , in the region @xmath8",
    "( @xmath7 is a multiplicative renormalization parameter ) , @xmath9 is the measured topological charge and @xmath10 denotes the integer closest to @xmath11 .    the topological susceptibility has then been computed via @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the spacetime volume and the statistical error has been determined by a bootstrap analysis .",
    "additionally , a systematic error has been estimated by comparing @xmath2 for different flow times .",
    "our result is @xmath14 ( since we are mainly interested in testing numerical methods , we always quote @xmath2 in units of the lattice spacing ) .",
    "the afho method is based on the topological charge density correlation function at large separations computed in a fixed topological sector , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the topological charge density and @xmath17 the mass of the lightest @xmath18 meson .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) is an expansion in @xmath19 and @xmath20 , i.e.  is valid for @xmath21 and @xmath22 . from the unfixed topology result of section  [ sec001 ] follows @xmath23 , which implies that ( [ eqn001 ] ) should be quite accurate for @xmath24 , while @xmath25 has to be treated with caution and @xmath26 must be discarded .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) shows that at large separations , the topological charge density correlation function converges to a constant , from which one can easily extract @xmath2 .",
    "our results have been obtained using the same gauge link configurations as in section  [ sec001 ] . in fig .  , our numerical results are shown , the topological charge density correlator @xmath27 as a function of the separation @xmath28 for different topological sectors .    @xmath29 as a function of the separation @xmath28 at flow time @xmath30 for different values of the topological charge @xmath31 .",
    "the horizontal lines are the expected plateaus @xmath32 with @xmath33 from section  [ sec001 ] . , width=472 ]    the theoretically expected values , using @xmath14 from the previous section , have also been plotted and are represented by the horizontal lines . the plateau values corresponding to different @xmath31 , as predicted in eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) , are clearly distinct . for values with @xmath22 ( i.e.  @xmath34 ) , there is excellent agreement . on the other hand , for @xmath35",
    "there is a slight tension , probably a consequence of @xmath36 , which is the expansion parameter of eq .",
    "( [ eqn001 ] ) and which should be small .",
    "we obtain @xmath37 via a combined fit to the @xmath1 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 results , which is consistent with our unfixed topology result from section  [ sec001 ] , @xmath14 .",
    "assuming a gaussian distribution of the topological charge , this method uses spacetime subvolumes @xmath40 , @xmath41 $ ] called `` slabs '' .",
    "the probability of having topological charge @xmath42 inside a slab under the condition that the topological charge of the total volume is @xmath31 is straightforward to calculate , @xmath43 defining @xmath44 allows to simplify ( [ eqn010 ] ) , @xmath45 from this expression one can read off @xmath46 the method to extract the topological susceptibility is then straightforward : one has to compute @xmath47 , the average of @xmath48 on the available gauge link configurations with topological charge @xmath31 , for several values of @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting points should be consistent with the parabola ( [ eqn002 ] ) , i.e.  @xmath2 can be obtained with a corresponding fit .    in fig .",
    ", numerical results for @xmath49 are shown for @xmath50 .",
    "@xmath51 as a function of @xmath11 for different values of the topological charge @xmath31 ( for better visibility points for @xmath1 ( @xmath39 ) are slightly shifted to the left ( right ) ) .",
    "the black curve represents the fit of eq .",
    "( [ eqn002 ] ) with an additive constant to the data points.,width=472 ]    the slabs used for the computations have temporal extent @xmath52 and spatial volume @xmath53 , periodic in space .",
    "we observe that the data points are not fully consistent with the quadratic curve ( [ eqn002 ] ) .",
    "in particular at small @xmath11 and small @xmath54 there are strong discrepancies . on the other hand ,",
    "the data points in the interval @xmath55 can be described nicely with ( [ eqn002 ] ) , if one allows for an additive constant . moreover",
    ", the corresponding result , @xmath56 , is then in agreement with the unfixed topology result from section  [ sec001 ] , @xmath14 .",
    "the distortions at small @xmath11 and small @xmath54 seem to be related to the gradient flow : for large flow times , these distortions become more and more prominent .",
    "understanding this issue in detail is part of our current research .",
    "to conclude , we have presented two methods allowing for the extraction of the topological susceptibility from simulations within a single topological sector .",
    "we have successfully applied them to qcd , demonstrating their practical use .",
    "the slab method has the advantage that one can apply it to any sufficiently large volume without encountering additional problems , while for the afho method the signal - to - noise ratio becomes worse when increasing the volume ( cf .",
