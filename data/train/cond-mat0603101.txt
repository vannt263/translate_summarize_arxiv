    "in a cellular environment soft objects like membranes and polymers are subject to brownian motion . as a result there are interactions between them which are entropic in origin , i.e. a consequence of constraints imposed on the brownian fluctuations .",
    "for example , two parallel membranes repel each other entropically with a potential that falls off like a power law in the distance between them @xcite .",
    "similarly , thermally fluctuating biopolymers like f - actin and microtubules may exert entropic forces on membranes or some other obstacles ; for an illustration see fig.[fig : setup ] .    though due to the same thermal fluctuations such forces have to be distinguished from forces obtained by pulling on a biopolymer @xcite .",
    "it will turn out that the force - distance curves of these two cases have no resemblance at all in a regime where thermal fluctuations play a role , which is generically the case for all cytoskeletal filaments .",
    "both types of forces are thought to play a prominent role in cell motility and movement of pathogens like listeria monocytogenes , that propel itself through the cytoplasm of infected cells by constructing behind it a polymerized tail of cross - linked actin filaments @xcite .",
    "similarly , in a crawling cell , the force generated from the growth of a collection of actin fibers is responsible for the protrusion of cell membrane , which are known as lamellipodia , filopodia , or microspikes according to their shapes @xcite .",
    "it seems that quite generally polymerizing networks of actin filaments are capable of exerting significant mechanical force , which are used by eukaryotic cells and their prokaryotic pathogens to change shape or move .",
    "one type of force is generated by fluctuating filaments at the leading edge of the network .",
    "the length of the thermally fluctuating parts of these polymers are typically @xmath0 nm , which is very short compared to their persistence length @xmath1 m @xcite , such that an analysis which considers these filaments as stiff seems appropriate .    in this paper",
    "we will not enter into the debate on the particular force generating mechanism responsible for all these different types of cell motility , but rather give a detailed analysis of the entropic forces which fluctuating stiff polymers exert on rigid walls .",
    "this may serve as important input for future molecular models of force generation in cellular systems .",
    "consider a semiflexible polymer with contour length @xmath2 and persistence length @xmath3 with one end fixed both in position and orientation to some rigid support ( see fig.[fig : setup ] ) , e.g. the dense part of an actin gel .",
    "we choose coordinates such that the grafted end is at the origin with the tangent fixed parallel to the @xmath4-axis .",
    "consider a rigid , smooth wall orthogonal to the @xmath5-@xmath4-plane at a distance @xmath6 from the origin .",
    "let @xmath7 be the angle between the @xmath4-axis and the normal @xmath8 of the wall .",
    "if @xmath6 is small enough , the wall will constrain the brownian fluctuations of the polymer leading to an increase in free energy with respect to the unconstrained polymer . on time",
    "scales larger than the equilibration time of the grafted polymer this results in an average force @xmath9 exerted on the wall .",
    "our goal is to calculate how the entropic force @xmath9 depends on @xmath6 and @xmath7 and the contour length @xmath2 and the persistence length @xmath3 of the polymer .",
    "we will proceed as follows .",
    "the following section [ sec : entropic_force ] serves to introduce and discuss the various types of thermodynamic forces which can be generated by fluctuating semiflexible polymers .",
    "we will arrive at the conclusion that the entropic forces discussed above are closely related to the probability distribution of the free end of the clamped polymer . in section [ sec : orthogonal ] we start our analysis of entropic forces with a polymer grafted perpendicular to the wall .",
    "this chapter contains a definition of the wormlike chain model and the basic idea of our analytical calculations , which starting from the tip distribution calculates the restricted free energy and the entropic force .",
    "the analysis is complemented by monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , which both show the range of validity of the analytical results and the crossover from semiflexible to gaussian chains .",
    "details of the calculations are deferred to the appendices [ app : inverse_laplace ] , [ app : saddle_point ] and [ app : jacobi_transform_parallel ] .",
    "section [ sec : oblique_angle ] treats the technically more complicated case of a polymer inclined at an angle @xmath7 with respect to the wall .",
    "here we obtain the entropic forces analytically up to the numerical evaluation of some integrals .",
    "for some asymptotic cases explicit analytical formula are again obtained . the mc simulations in this chapter",
    "are restricted to a parameter range which is close to the stiff limit , and mainly serve the purpose to define the range of applicability of the anayltical results .",
    "finally , in the conclusion we give a discussion of our main results .",
    "according to the _ wormlike chain model _",
    "@xcite , the elastic energy of a given configuration @xmath10 , parameterized in terms of the arc length @xmath11 $ ] , is given by @xmath12 here @xmath13 is the local tangent to the contour @xmath10 and @xmath14 is the persistence length with @xmath15 the polymer s bending modulus , and @xmath16 .",
    "as the polymer is considered to be inextensible , we have @xmath17 for all @xmath18 , i.e. the tangent vectors are restricted to the unit sphere .    in a cellular environment biopolymers",
    "are flexed by brownian motion , i.e. they exhibit thermal fluctuations in their shape .",
    "this mere fact makes for a rich mechanic response genuinly different from its classical analogue , a rigid beam .",
    "consider a polymer whose position ( not its orientation ) is fixed at one end and one is pulling on its other end , a typical situation encountered in an experiment using optical or magnetic tweezers . then there is no unique force - distance relation .",
    "it actually matters whether one pulls at constant force @xmath9 and measures the resulting average distance @xmath19 or vice versa .",
    "results for the constant force ensemble are thoroughly discussed in ref.@xcite . in a constant distance ensemble",
    "the probability density distribution of the end - to - end distance @xmath20 provides the necessary information @xcite .",
    "it defines a free energy @xmath21 from which the average force may be derived by differentiation , @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "here we are interested in the force a fluctuating filament exerts on a rigid obstacle which is fixed in its position @xcite .",
    "the polymer s end facing the obstacle is considered as free to fluctuate and only its proximal end is fixed in position and orientation ; see fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "since there are no direct forces between polymer and obstacle the force exerted on the wall is solely due to the steric constraints imposed on the filament .",
    "this suggests to use the term `` entropic forces '' , frequently used in analogous physical situations @xcite .",
    "however , this should not leave the reader with the wrong impression that there are different physical origins for entropic forces and those discussed in the preceeding paragraph .",
    "it is merely the type of `` boundary condition '' imposed on the thermal fluctuations which leads to their ( drastically ) different character .    for getting acquainted with the problem",
    "let us consider the simplest case , a grafted polymer whose one end and tangent is fixed such that it is oriented perpendicular to a smooth wall ( fig.[fig : setup ] with @xmath23 ) .",
    "the presence of the wall allows only for those polymer configurations which are entirely in the halfspace to the left of the wall .",
    "since we are mostly interested in stiff polymers ( which have a low probability for back - turns ) this restriction may be approximated as a constraint solely on the position of the polymer tip facing the wall , @xmath24 ; later in section [ sec : entropic_forces_explicit ] we will show some simulation data going beyond this approximation .    to derive the average force acting on the wall we consider a wall potential @xmath25 for the free polymer tip , which at the end of the calculation will be reduced to a hard wall potential . for now picture a steep potential which rises rapidly for @xmath26",
    "then , the ensemble average for the force the polymer tip excerts perpendicular to the wall reads @xmath27 \\ ,       { \\mbox{e}}^{- \\beta ( h+u ) } \\ ,       \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial r_z ( l ) } \\ , .",

    "this is now a thermodynamic force . in an actual experiments it is obtained by a time average with an averaging time much larger than the equilibration time for the grafted polymer",
    "this force would also be measured in an experiment where a large number of independent and identical polymers push against the same wall .    since the wall potential depends only on the difference between the position of the polymer tip and the wall we may rewrite the entropic force in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stat_mech_def_ef ] ) as @xmath31 upon definig a free energy of the confined polymer as @xmath32 the entropic forces again reads as a spatial derivative of a free energy @xmath33 the physical interpretation of this free energy becomes clear as one goes to the hard wall limit .",
    "then , the partition function reduces to @xmath34   \\ ,          \\theta(\\zeta - r_z(l ) ) \\ , { \\mbox{e}}^{-\\beta h }     \\nonumber \\\\     & = : & { \\langle { \\theta(\\zeta - r_z(l ) ) } \\rangle}_0 \\ ; , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the subscript @xmath35 indicates that the average is now taken with respect to the bending hamiltonian only .",
    "the @xmath36-function , defined such that @xmath37 for @xmath38 and zero elsewhere , indicates that only those configurations are counted with the position of the polymer tip to the left of the wall .",
    "hence , as for the fixed distance ensemble in a pulling experiment , the free energy results from a quantity measuring the number of configurations obeying the imposed constraint , where each configuration is weighted by a boltzmann factor for the bending energy .",
    "it is useful to rewrite the partition function as @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the probability density to find the @xmath4-coordinate of the polymer s free end at @xmath4 , irrespective of its transverse coordinates .",
    "it identifies the restricted partition sum as the cummulative distribution function corresponding to the probability density @xmath41 .",
    "one may then write the entropic force in the alternative form @xmath42 upon multiplying this formula by @xmath43 it may be interpreted as follows .",
    "the work done on the wall upon displacing it by an infinitesimal distance @xmath44 equals the thermal energy scale @xmath45 times a conditional probability @xmath46 , which measures the probability that the position of the polymer tip is within a distance @xmath44 from the wall given that the polymer is in the left halfspace .    since the probability density for the position of the polymer tip @xmath47 is actually a function of the position perpendicular and transverse to the wall , eq .",
    "( [ eq : entropic_force - best ] ) immediately suggests that one could define a _",
    "local _ entropic pressure .",
    "indeed , upon generalizing the above arguments one may write @xmath48 \\ ,       \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial \\zeta }       \\delta({\\mathbf}x \\!-\\ ! { \\mathbf}r_\\perp ( l ) ) \\ ,       { \\mbox{e}}^{- \\beta ( h+u ) }    \\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{{k_\\text{b}t}}{{\\cal z}_\\parallel ( \\zeta ) } \\ ,        \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\zeta }       { \\langle { \\theta(\\zeta - r_z(l ) ) \\",

    "again , the entropic force is given by the thermal energy scale times a conditional probability density , which now measures the probability of finding the polymer tip at a particular site @xmath49 on the wall conditioned on the polymer configuration being to the left of the wall .",
    "pictorially , one may say that the local pressure is given by @xmath45 times the number of `` collisions '' of the polymer with the wall per unit area , a reasoning which is frequently used in scaling analyses .",
    "the total force is , of course , obtained by integrating over this local pressure , @xmath50 .",
    "in addition , one may now also define an entropic torque as has recently been done for a rigid rod facing a planar wall @xcite ; we leave this issue for future investigations .",
    "generalizing the above ideas suggests to introduce an effective local free energy per unit area as @xmath51 which is useful in applications where the obstacle is actually not rigid but soft with some internal elasticity , e.g. a membrane , whose dynamics is much slower than the equilibration time of the polymer .",
    "then the elastic energy describing membrane bending and the above effective free energy may just be added to describe the combined system . of course , such a description fails if time scales for the dynamics of both soft objects are comparable .",
    "our main conclusion in this section is that entropic forces generated by a grafted stiff polymer can be reduced to the calculation of the probability distribution of the polymer tip . for a polymer constrained to two dimensions",
    "this distribution function has been found to show quite interesting behavior such as bimodality in the transverse displacement of the free end @xcite .",
    "this pronounced feature of the distribution function has recently been rationalized upon exploiting an interesting analogy to a random walker in shear flow @xcite .",
    "in this section we are going to calculate the entropic force generated by a grafted polymer whose orientation is on average perpendicular to the wall .",
    "it illustrates the basic idea of our analytical calculations for the simplest geometry .      in evaluating the distribution function",
    "analytically we restrict ourselves to the limit of a _ weakly bending filament_. in other words , we consider the persistence length @xmath3 to be large enough compared to the total contour length @xmath2 , such that the statistical weight of configurations with small sharp bends will be negligible",
