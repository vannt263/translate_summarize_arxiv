    "as it was shown by lynden - bell ( 1981 ) and sandage ( 1986 ) , in the simplest case of spherical symmetry with cosmological parameter @xmath6 the radius @xmath5 depends only on the total mass of a group @xmath7 and the age of the universe @xmath8 :    @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the gravitational constant . measuring @xmath5 via distances and radial velocities of galaxies outside the virial radius of the system @xmath11 , one can determine the total mass of the system independent of its virial mass estimate .",
    "note that both the methods deriving mass from internal and from external galaxy motions correspond to different linear scales where @xmath5 is roughly 4 times as large as the virial radius .",

    "a substantial overlap between the two last _ luminosity - linewidth _ samples provides confirmation that their zero points are the same and gives rms agreement per measure of 0.40 mag . as it is seen from fig.1 by tully et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , there is an excellent agreement in distance moduli between the _ luminosity - linewidth _ and other ( cepheid , trgb , sbf and snia ) measures . in particular , for 12 galaxies in our list with both tf and trgb or snia moduli the mean distance difference is ( @xmath39 )  mpc , while for 20 galaxies with sbf or trgb moduli the average difference is only ( @xmath40 )  mpc .",
    "following the previous authors ( tully & shaya 1984 , ekholm et al .",

    "we have considered the radiogalaxy virgo  a = ngc  4486 to be the physical center of the cluster as its position is close to the center of x - ray emitting gas .",
    "the total number of galaxies in this cone volume with apex angle @xmath41 is 630 ( the _ 2d sample _ ) .",
    "limiting the angular separation of galaxies from the virgo center introduces some selection effects into the virgocentric flow analysis . for this reason we have used also another way to form the observational sample , considering galaxies with spatial distances from the virgo cluster center @xmath42 mpc ( the _ 3d sample _ )",
    "this approach suffers a drawback too because galaxy distances are measured with errors and their significance is different at the proximate and the distant boundary of the spherical volume ( the so - called _ malmquist bias _ ) .",
    "the total number of galaxies in our 3d sample amounts to 1792 , and the fractions of diverse subsamples differ significantly from that in the 2d sample",
    ".    table 1 presents the summary of observational data that we have used .",
    "the first column indicates subsample kinds , the second one gives typical distance errors expressed in magnitudes .",
    "columns ( 3 ) and ( 5 ) contain numbers of galaxies in the cone ( 2d ) or in the spherical ( 3d ) volume . the _ sample goodness _",
    "@xmath10 , defined as @xmath43 , is a useful parameter which characterizes a statistical weight of a certain sample ( kudrya et al .",
    "goodness values are indicated in columns ( 4 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "for example , the subsample of galaxies with snia distances is scanty but its statistical significance is comparable with that of other samples because of higher accuracy of distance measurements . as one can see , the galaxy subsample acsvcs+ has the maximum statistical weight in the 2d set , however almost all these galaxies are concentrated within the virial radius . in the 3d set the highest goodness corresponds to the trgb sample , but its majority is crowded on the nearby side of the examined volume .",
    "the last two tf samples exhibit a significant increase in number going from the 2d to the 3d samples that is caused by the well - known effect of morphological segregation of late - type vs. early - type galaxies along the cluster radius .",
    "the virial radius of the virgo cluster @xmath44 mpc ( hoffman et al . 1980 ) corresponds to its angular scale of 6.0@xmath30 , assuming the average distance to the cluster members to be 17.0 mpc .",
    "radial velocities and distances relative to the local group ( lg ) centroid for 259 galaxies in this zone are represented in the top panel of fig.1 . here",
    ", precise distances for most the galaxies were obtained within the special survey acsvcs with hst ( mei et al .",
    "the virgo cluster members , located in the distance range from 14 to 20 mpc , demonstrate a radial velocity scatter from @xmath45800 up to @xmath462300 km s@xmath20 .",
    "foreground galaxies are scarcely presented on the panel while background objects tend to lie below the linear hubble regression with the global hubble parameter @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 ( spergel et al .",
    "2007 ) , showing thereby the expected effect of infall into the virgo cluster from the opposite side .",
    "the centroid of galaxies forming the `` virial column '' at [ @xmath47 mpc , marked by vertical lines , has a mean velocity @xmath461004@xmath4870 km s@xmath20 versus the expected hubble velocity of @xmath461224 km s@xmath20 at the distance of 17.0 mpc , which can be explained by a peculiar motion of the local group @xmath49 km  s@xmath20 directed towards virgo .",
    "the dotted and solid s - shaped curves correspond to a hubble flow perturbed by a point - like mass of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( as the limiting cases discussed below ) for the line - of - sight passing exactly through the cluster center .",
    "the distributions of radial velocities and distances for remaining galaxies of the 2d sample in close surroundings of virgo , ( @xmath52 ) and in a distant periphery ( @xmath53 ) , are shown in the middle and the bottom panels of fig.1 . here",
    ", the solid and dotted s - shaped lines having lower amplitudes describe the behavior of perturbed hubble flow at angular distances @xmath54 equal @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "these panels display some signs of the infall effect too , however , in front of the virgo , the expected infall is seen barely .",
    "considering a set of such kind hubble diagrams with their different amplitudes of s - shaped waves decreasing with the angular distance @xmath54 , one can find the quantity of the cluster mass that fits the observed infall pattern in the best way .",
    "but this approach seems us to be not transperent enough . in order to determine @xmath5 and the total cluster mass via it ,",
    "we have converted our observational data into distances and velocities expressed relative to the cluster center .",
    "the top panel of fig.2 shows the layout of a galaxy ( @xmath10 ) relative to the observer ( @xmath57 ) and the cluster center ( @xmath58 ) with angular separation @xmath54 from the cluster center .",
    "the spatial distance of the galaxy from the center therefore is    @xmath59    assuming that the galaxy and the cluster center are involved in an almost unperturbed hubble flow ( _ hf _ case ) with negligible peculiar velocities , we can state the mutual velocity difference between @xmath10 and @xmath58 in projection onto the stright line connecting them as    @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the distribution of galaxies in the virgocentric reference frame @xmath63 is represented in fig.3 .",
    "the only 391 galaxies with angles @xmath64 obeying @xmath65 or @xmath66 from the whole 2d sample are shown here . selecting galaxies situated approximately in front and behind the cluster",
    "is meant to reduce the role of tangential velocity componens which remain still unknown .",
    "the polygon curve traces the running median with a window of 1 mpc .",
    "the median follows roughly the linear hubble regression with @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 ( the inclined dashed line ) at middle virgocentric distances of @xmath6715 mpc , but tends to deviate from the @xmath68 line at smaller scales , crossing the zero - velocity line at @xmath69 mpc .",
    "the behaviour of the running median at large scales is strongly skewed by a selection effect due to the adopted limit for galaxy velocities @xmath70 km s@xmath20 .    another approach can be used also for converting the observational radial velocity of a galaxy @xmath71 into its virgocentric velocity ( the case of pure virgocentric flow , _ vf _ ) .",
    "if the galaxy is not involved in the general cosmological expansion but is falling instead towards the virgo cluster with a velocity @xmath72 ( fig.2b ) , than its radial velocity relative to the observer will be expressed as    @xmath73 and the infall velocity @xmath72 itself can be written as    @xmath74 where the angles @xmath54 and @xmath64 are shown in the fig.2b .",
    "evidently , the discrepancy between these two extreme approaches , _ hf _ and _ vf _ , decreases when @xmath64 tends to 0 or to 180@xmath30 .    as can be easily seen , selecting galaxies both in the cone with apex angle @xmath75 and the angle @xmath64 entails a loss of galaxies at large virgocentric distances which becomes apparent in the top right corner of the fig.3 .",
    "a selection of galaxies in the volume @xmath42 mpc ( 3d sample ) reduces the bias appreciably .",
    "fig.4 represents the sky distribution of galaxies with known virgocentric distances up to 30 mpc in equatorial coordinates .",
    "the galaxies of this 3d sample are marked as circles and their diameters indicate three distance ranges : ( 012 ) mpc , ( 1222 ) mpc , and more than 22 mpc from the observer .",
    "this map exhibits that the selection of galaxies by their angle @xmath41 brings some systematic skews dependent on distance .",
    "in particular foreground virgo galaxies are preferentially removed by this angular selection .",
    "the hubble diagram for 1792 galaxies of the 3d sample is represented in fig.5 .",
    "the symbols for objects from different sources of distance data are the same as for fig.1 .",
    "the number of galaxies in the 3d sample is roughly 3 times as large as in the 2d sample .",
    "it is noteworthy , they populate the crucial regions in front and behind the virgo cluster more thoroughly giving us an opportunity for more detailed analyses of the virgocentric infall .",
    "the velocity - distance relation for these galaxies with respect to the cluster center is shown in fig.6 .",
    "its top panel corresponds to the assumption of pure hubble flow of galaxies ( _ hf _ case ) while the bottom panel represents the case of pure radial motions towards the virgo center ( _ vf _ ) .",
    "as previously , the galaxies located far away from the line of sight crossing the cluster center , i.e. with 45@xmath76 , are eliminated in order to reduce the role of unknown tangential velocity components .",
    "this condition diminishes the number of sampled galaxies by 42% .",
    "comparison the bottom panel of fig.6 with the top one shows that switching from the _ hf _ case to the _ vf _ case does not lead to any dramatic changes in the hubble flow pattern given in the virgocentric coordinates .",
    "some galaxies move along the vertical axis appreciably but the total behaviour of the running medians traces the infall of galaxies towards the cluster in a similar way .",
    "the asymptotic tendency of the median at large distances @xmath77 looks much more regular for the 3d sample than for the 2d one .",
    "our elimination of galaxies with 45@xmath76 is a little arbitrary . to estimate the response of the virgocentric flow pattern to changing this condition we have imposed also a more rigid constraint , eliminating galaxies with @xmath78",
    "the corresponding diagrams for _ hf _ and _ vf _ cases are represented in two panels of fig.7 .",
    "as it is seen , the more severe selection of galaxies by @xmath64 reduces their number by more than a half .",
    "however , the behaviour of the running median is almost the same .    in the bottom panel of fig.7 every galaxy from the samples a",
    ", b , c , and d ( see table 1 ) having a distance error within 12% is supplied by error bars indicating where the galaxy should be situated if its distance from the observer changes by @xmath79 .",
    "as expected , these error bars are much longer for galaxies situated behind the cluster . changing a galaxy distance by @xmath80% leads in some regions of the \\{@xmath81 } diagram to significant displacement of the galaxy along the both virgocentric coordinates , and therefore to appreciable galaxy skips relative to the zero - velocity line .",
    "( we do not include the longer error bars for the tully - fisher distances ) .    to quantify the uncertainties on the running median curves plotted in figs .",
    "6 and 7 , we generated extensive sets of bootstrap realisations .",
    "their results permit us to estimate the radius of the zero velocity surface and also its rms error presented in table 2 .",
    "the table columns contain : ( 1 ) size of the window for a running median , taken to be 0.8 , 1.0 , and 1.2 mpc ; ( 2,3 ) the mean radius of the zero velocity surface @xmath5 and its rms scatter obtained with regarding to the assumptions on the pure hubble flow ( _ hf _ ) and the pure virgocentric flow ( _ vf _ ) , respectively ; here only four samples : a , b , c , and d with precise distance moduli were taken into account ; ( 4,5 ) the same quantities for the samples e and f with tully - fisher distances ; ( 6,7 ) the radii @xmath5 and their errors for the total set of available data on galaxy distances .",
    "we shell discuss the interpretation of these different estimates of @xmath5 in the next section .",
    "we have analysed available observational data on distances and radial velocities of galaxies in wide surroundings of the virgo cluster in order to study the virgocentric infall .",
    "the main purpose of the present paper is to determine the radius of the zero - velocity surface @xmath5 that separates the cluster against the global cosmic expansion . by using this observational quantity we are able to estimate the total mass of the virgo concentrated within @xmath5 and",
    "compare it with the virial mass estimates corresponding to roughly 4 times lower scale , @xmath11 . based on the hubble diagrams transformed into virgocentric coordinates and the results of our bootstrap numerical experiments given in table 2",
    ", we derive @xmath5 to be in the range of @xmath82  mpc with a typical random error of 1.0  mpc .",
    "the derived value of @xmath5 can be affected by some systematic circumstances .",
    "analysis of the hubble diagrams in the virgocentric coordinates suffers the lack of data on tangential velocity components of the galaxies .",
    "we tried to overcome this drawback with assumptions regarding a dominant type of galaxy motions in the virgo proximity .",
    "conversion of the observed radial velocities of galaxies into their virgocentric velocities was performed by us under two extreme kinematic assumptions : almost unperturbed hubble flow ( _ hf _ ) or almost pure radial flow towards virgo ( _ vf _ ) .",
    "we found that adopting one or another scheme does nt change significantly a general pattern of the virgocentric infall .",
    "calculating velocities in the _ vf _ case yields , at the average , some smaller values of @xmath83 , which causes a slightly larger ( @xmath460.7 mpc ) value of @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath5 quantities presented in table 2 tend to be correlated with the smoothing window size . when the window changes from 0.8  mpc to 1.2  mpc , the radius dicreases on 0.3  mpc at average .",
    "variation the window size in wider range : from 0.5  mpc to 2.0  mpc still leaves @xmath5 within its random errors .",
    "the most noticeable systematic variations in the radius @xmath5 are seen in dependence on galaxy samples .",
    "the use of samples of galaxies with only precise distance measurements ( via cepheids , trgb , sbf , and snia ) yields the radius @xmath5 within @xmath84  mpc , while the use of less precise tully - fisher distances leads to @xmath5 estimates around 5.2  mpc .",
    "the physical origin of this difference is clear .",
    "probably , the instance is just related with the fact that a typical distance error for tully - fisher method ( @xmath38% ) corresponds at the virgo distance to a linear scale of 3.4  mpc that comparable with the virial diameter of the cluster ( 3.6  mpc ) .",
    "large random errors can throw galaxies over the `` virial column '' diluting the shape of s - wave infall .",
    "nevertheless , we should stress that two completely independent sets of observational data on distances to early - type and late - type galaxies lead to quite compatible values of @xmath5 . as can be seen from table 1 , two samples with tully - fisher distances ( e+f )",
    "are about 2 times as large in galaxy number as the samples ( a+b+c+d ) with precise distances . because we estimate @xmath5 based on the running median without regard to galaxy weights ( distance errors ) , the radius @xmath5 for the total sample turns out to be closer to that for the former samples .",
    "assuming @xmath5 for the virgo cluster in the range of @xmath85  mpc , we obtain from eq .",
    "( 4 ) the total mass of the cluster to be within @xmath3 .",
    "this value is consistent with the virial mass estimates for the virgo : @xmath86 ( hoffman et al .",
    "1980 ) , @xmath87 ( tully & shaya 1984 ) and @xmath88 ( tonry et al . 2000 ) normalized to the same hubble parameter @xmath19 km s@xmath20 mpc@xmath20 .",
    "it should be reminded that this agreement is on very different scales as the zero velocity radius , @xmath5 , is roughly 4 times as large as the virial radius .",
    "this means our results are consistent with there being * no additional mass * outside the virial radius of the virgo cluster .",
    "two items are worth mentioning in conclusions .",
    "the stated method of estimating @xmath5 value from observational data relays on the assumptions that a cluster has spherically symmetric shape and that galaxy motions around the cluster are regular without a significant tangential component .",
    "deviations from the simple spherical infall scenario have been considered both theoretically and observationally by many authors ( peebles 1980 , davis & peebles 1983 , lilje et al .",

    "as seen from their figs .",
    "20,21 , the great attractor with a total mass of @xmath89 situated at a distance of 43 mpc generates significant distortions in the velocity field over the area of @xmath671 steradian .",
    "besides , tully ( 1988 ) found so called effect of `` local velocity anomaly '' arising by a push of the local void . according to tully",
    "( 2009 ) , a bulk motion of @xmath67260 km  s@xmath20 toward the supergalactic pole may be attributed to the local void .",

    "we would emphasize that observational abilities to determine @xmath5 and @xmath7 with a better accuracy have not been exhausted yet .",
    "with the derived @xmath5 around 7  mpc , the zero - velocity surface is situated at a distance of about 10  mpc from the observer , i.e. on the local volume edge .",

    "the addition of more galaxies with measured distances in the range @xmath91  mpc from the local group would allow a better measurement of @xmath5 , in particular these galaxies could be used to better rule out the case where there is a large amount of mass outside the virial radius .",
