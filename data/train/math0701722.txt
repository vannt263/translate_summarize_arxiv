    "regular covering projection _ of connected ( simple ) graphs .",
    "comparing symmetry properties of a given base graph @xmath7 and a covering graph @xmath9 has become quite an active area of research in recent years .",
    "the motivation stems from problems related to construction and classification of certain classes of graphs and maps on surfaces , counting the number of graphs in certain families , producing lists of graphs with a given degree of symmetry , inductive approach to studying the structure of graphs via inspection of smaller graphs arising as quotients relative to a semiregular group of automorphisms etc .",
    "references are too numerous to be listed here , but see , for instance , @xcite .",
    "questions related to symmetry properties of @xmath7 and @xmath9 are intimately linked with the problem of _ lifting and projecting automorphisms _ @xcite .",
    "let @xmath25 and @xmath26 be automorphisms with the property that @xmath27 ( note that functions are composed on the right ) ; such an automorphism @xmath28 is known as a _ lift _ of @xmath29 while @xmath29 is the _ projection _ of @xmath28 along @xmath2 . if all elements of a subgroup @xmath30 have a lift , then the collection of all such lifts forms the _ lifted group _ @xmath31 ; the projection @xmath2 is then called _",
    "@xmath1-admissible_. in particular , the group of _ covering transformations _",
    "@xmath32 is the lift of the trivial group , and @xmath3 is isomorphic to an extension of @xmath4 by @xmath1 .",
    "we remark that any abstract group extension can be viewed as a lifting problem ; this adds further motivation to the topic .",
    "a @xmath1-admissible regular covering projection @xmath0 is called _ split relative to @xmath1 _ ( or _ @xmath1-split _ for short ) whenever the extension @xmath33 is split .",
    "this case deserves special attention : since there exists a complement @xmath8 of @xmath4 within @xmath3 we can compare actions of two isomorphic groups , @xmath1 on @xmath7 and @xmath10 on @xmath9 , where @xmath10 projects isomorphically onto @xmath1 along @xmath2 . a restrictive situation such as this makes it possible to derive a lot more information about graphs and their symmetries",
    ".    however , the analysis can still be quite complicated .",
    "this is due to the fact that several complements @xmath10 of @xmath4 might exist within @xmath3 , which moreover differ in their actions on @xmath9 .",
    "two particular cases of split covers seem to stand out .",
    "the first one occurs when there exists a complement @xmath10 which is _",
    "sectional_. by this we mean that there is a _ section _ of @xmath9  a set of vertices containing exactly one point from each fibre  which is invariant under the action of @xmath10 .",
    "the second particular case occurs when there exists a complement @xmath10 which is transitive on @xmath9 ( @xmath1 itself must then be transitive on @xmath7 ) .",
    "two particularly interesting extremal cases of split covers can now be defined along these lines .",
    "a projection @xmath2 is called _ split - sectional _ if all complements of @xmath4 within @xmath3 are sectional , and is _ split - transitive _",
    "if all complements are transitive .",
    "a projection is called _ split - mixed _ whenever both sectional and transitive complements exist . of course",
    ", it can also happen that each complement of @xmath4 within @xmath3 is neither sectional nor transitive .",
    "this fourth possibility is perhaps less interesting , and definitely the most difficult of all to analyze .    in this paper",
    "we restrict ourselves to _",
    "@xmath6-covers _ , that is , to regular covering projections @xmath0 where @xmath4 is isomorphic to the cyclic group @xmath34 , with a particular emphasis given to such covering projections in the context of cubic symmetric graphs . now ,",
    "if the projection is @xmath1-split , the lifted group @xmath3 is necessarily isomorphic to the direct product @xmath35 . in other words , complements @xmath10 of @xmath4 are normal in @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , let us assume that @xmath1 is transitive on @xmath7 .",
    "then any complement is either sectional or transitive in its action on @xmath9 .",
    "thus , apart form the possibility that @xmath0 is non - split relative to @xmath1 , there are three possible _ types _ of @xmath1-split @xmath6-covers : split - sectional , split - transitive , and split - mixed . obviously",
    ", these various kinds of lifts do depend on all four items involved : the graph @xmath7 , the cover @xmath9 , the actual projection @xmath0 , and the group @xmath1 .",
    "for example , the cube @xmath36 is obtained as a sectional split @xmath6-cover of @xmath37 relative to the alternating group @xmath38 ; on the other hand , @xmath36 can be viewed as a mixed split @xmath6-cover relative to the symmetric group @xmath39 .",
    "for details see section  [ sec - examples ] where a thorough analysis of all these possibilities is given in the context of some cubic symmetric graphs of small order .",
    "the rest of this article is organized as follows . in section  [ sec :",
    "ex ] , split lifts with a sectional a complement are considered ( for general graphs ) . in section  [ subsec : transitive ] ,",
    "transitive complements are considered in the context of cubic symmetric graphs . in section  [ sec - height ]",
    "we consider consecutive @xmath6-lifts and show that within split covers only two such lifts are possible for cubic symmetric graphs we end the paper with section  [ sec : remarks ] , where we propose a short list of problems for future research .",
    "we now give examples of all four types of @xmath6-covers , using the complete graph @xmath37 on @xmath12 vertices and the petersen graph @xmath40 as base graphs . throughout this article most of our examples",
    "will be given in the context of cubic symmetric graphs .",
    "we will therefore use standard notation for these graphs from the extended foster census , see @xcite , together with commonly used names for some of them where appropriate . by fna , fnb , etc .",
    "we will refer to the corresponding graphs of order @xmath41 in the foster census of all cubic symmetric graphs @xcite , where the symbol fna is conveniently shortened to fn whenever a unique such graph exists .",
    "for example , @xmath37 and @xmath40 are the graphs @xmath42 and @xmath43 , respectively .    before starting with examples ,",
    "some additional terminology is in order .",
