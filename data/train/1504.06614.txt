    "note that both @xmath27 and @xmath28 characterize only the rates of destruction of the exciton in the cp29 lhc , and they do not describe any subsequent chemical reactions that take place in the damaging and the charge transfer channels . in this sense ,",

    "the energy of the damaging state , @xmath24 , was chosen : @xmath89 , close enough to initially populated level , @xmath90 , of @xmath67 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ a1]a , when only one sink , @xmath17 ( related to the cts ) is open ( green curve , @xmath91 ) , the efficiency of the npq process experiences a maximum ( @xmath92 ) , at the et rate , @xmath93 .",
    "the important observation is that when @xmath28 increases , the efficiency , @xmath94 , decreases .",

    "the results of numerical simulations are presented for the npq efficiency , @xmath100 and for the efficiency of the damaging channel , @xmath101 , for fixed et rate , @xmath95 .",
    "so , two sinks are open in this case .",
    "the two main differences from the previous results presented in figs .",
    "[ a1]a and [ a1]b , are caused by the following two modifications .",
    "first , in fig .",
    "[ a3]b , the energy of the damaging state was chosen , @xmath102 , which is significantly below the value , @xmath103 , which was used in figs .",
    "[ a1]a and [ a1]b ( and in fig .",
    "second , the influence of noise , produced by the protein environment , is included .    in our model ,",
    "noise is generated by the rtp , and it has two characteristic parameters : the amplitude of the correlation function , @xmath104 , and the correlation time , @xmath105 .",
    "also , the influence of noise on the cp29 lhc is characterized by the interaction constants ( matrix elements of  site - protein \" interactions ) , @xmath52 ( @xmath106 ) .",
    "then , instead of parameters , @xmath52 , the renormalized parameters , @xmath107 , occur in our model .",
    "the important property of the influence of noise on the chlorophyll dimer , discussed in @xcite , is the following .",
    "under the  resonant conditions \" , @xmath108 , the influence of noise on the dimer , @xmath109 , becomes maximal in the sense that the et rate has a resonant peak .    in fig .",
    "[ a3]a , the damaging level ( @xmath89 ) is chosen close to the energy level of @xmath67 .",
    "the efficiencies of sinks , @xmath94 and @xmath98 , are indicated by the blue and red curves , respectively .",
    "blue and red solid curves correspond to the resonant noise ( @xmath110 ) on the dimer , @xmath111 .",
    "blue and red dashed and blue and red dash - dot curves correspond to non - resonant noise on the dimer , @xmath111 .",
    "green and yellow curves correspond to the absence of noise .",
    "as one can see , the maximum of the npq efficiency is , @xmath112 , almost independent of noise , in the vicinity of @xmath93 .",
    "this behavior of @xmath94 , in the vicinity of @xmath113 , can be explained as follows . because the damaging sink is close ( in energy ) to the @xmath67 energy level , the damaging sink accumulates during @xmath85 the amount of probability which practically is independent of the amplitude of noise .",
    "different dependence of the npq efficiency on noise , in the vicinity of its maximum , occurs when the damaging energy level , @xmath114 , is relatively far from the energy level of the @xmath67 .",
    "as one can see from fig .",
    "[ a3]b , the resonant noise ( @xmath115 ) , acting on the dimer , @xmath111 , significantly degrades the npq performance in the vicinity of @xmath116 ( blue dashed curve ) .",
    "the reason is that the resonant noise acting on the @xmath111 transition , helps to accumulate extra probability in the damaging sink .",
    "when noise is non - resonant on the @xmath111 transition ( blue curve ) the npq efficiency improves up to , @xmath117 , and it approaches the npq efficiency when noise is absent ( green curve ) .      when noise is absent , the st , in relation to the npq mechanism , is easy to explain in terms of the effective non - hermitian hamiltonian , @xmath118 , where the hermitian operator , @xmath119 , is defined by eq .",

    "the energy level of the damaging state was chosen , @xmath102 .",
    "as one can see , in the vicinity of @xmath124 , the red curve experiences a maximum . at this point",
    ", a segregation of the decay widths begins .",
    "namely , when @xmath28 grows , the red and blue curves start to separate .",
    "so , the decay width of one ( superradiant ) eigenstate continue to grow with @xmath28 , and the decay widths of all other ( subradient ) eigenstates decreases .",
    "this segregation behavior of the decay widths is one of the characteristic properties of the st @xcite . as one can see from fig .",
    "[ a3]b ( green curve ) , in the vicinity of the st ( @xmath124 ) , the npq efficiency experiences its maximum behavior , with @xmath117 .",

    "different colors correspond to five different eigenstates .",
    "as one can see , at the superradiance transition ( @xmath128 ) , the superradiant state , with largest decay width ( blue curve ) , begins to overlap ( interact ) with its neighboring eigenstate ( red curve ) .",
    "indeed , at this point the spacing between these two states ( resonances ) is approximately equal to the half - sum of their decay widths : @xmath129 .",
    "then , these resonances can not be considered to be isolated , and they both coherently contribute to the et to the corresponding sink ( continuum ) @xcite . in our case , only two resonances overlap at @xmath130 .",
    "when @xmath28 grows , the decay width of the superradiant state grows , and finally the superradiant resonance overlaps with all other resonances .",

    "( see the next sub - section . )",
    "note also , that usually many interacting resonances may overlap and contribute to the st @xcite .",
    "when discussing the st , the diagram of the trajectories of the eigenenergies in the complex plane ( @xmath131 , @xmath132 ) can produce additional insight to the features of the st @xcite .",

    "the insert ( c ) demonstrates the behavior of the eigenenergies for large values of @xmath28 .",
    "the following parameters were chosen : @xmath136 and @xmath137 .",
    "to study numerically the localization properties of the eigenstates , we use the participation ratio ( pr ) @xcite of the eigenfunction , @xmath41 , defined as , @xmath138 its value varies from 1 , for a fully localized eigenstate , to 5 , for a fully delocalized eigenstate . in fig .",
    "[ pr ] , the prs for all five eigenfunctions are presented , as functions of @xmath139 .",
    "as one can see , the superradiance state ( blue curve ) is partly delocalized for relatively small values of @xmath140 , and it becomes localized at the site , @xmath18 , for large values of @xmath28 .",

    "different colors indicate different eigenfunctions . as one can see , the superradiant eigenstate , indicated by the blue curve , is localized mainly on the cts , @xmath18 .",
    "this is the main reason why this eigenstate , which has the largest decay width , does not contribute significantly to the st , or to the npq dynamics .",
    "( see green curve in fig .",
    "[ a3]b . ) indeed , the initial condition corresponds to the population of the @xmath67 ( site @xmath144 ) .",
    "then , at large values of the et rate , @xmath28 , this initially populated state , @xmath144 , only weakly overlaps with the superradiant eigenstate .",
    "so , during the finite time , @xmath85 ( as in figs .",
    "[ a3]a and [ a3]b ) ) , the efficiency of the npq , @xmath145 is relatively small .",

    "as one can see , for relatively the small value , @xmath97 ( green color ) , the superradiant eigenstate is inhomogeneously delocalized over all five sites",
    ". the value @xmath148 ( blue color ) corresponds to the vicinity of the st , and to the best performance of the npq mechanism .",
    "the superradiant eigenstate is still inhomogeneously delocalized over all five sites . when @xmath28 increases ( @xmath149 , orange color ) , the localization of the superradiant eigenstate on the cts , @xmath18 , increases .",
    "for large values of @xmath141 ( red color ) , the superradiant eigenstate is mainly localized on the cts ( site @xmath18 ) .",
    "our main result is the demonstration of the relation between the two well - known phenomena : the nonphotochemical quenching ( npq ) mechanism in photosynthetic organisms and the superradiance transition ( st ) , that occurs in many physical and biological systems . for concreteness",
    ", we analyzed this relation by using a relatively simple model for the npq by the charge transfer state ( cts ) , in the cp29 minor lhc of the psii .",
    "the npq protocol we used , is mainly based on the experimental results discussed in @xcite .    in the absence of noise",
    ", our model is described by an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian , which is represented by a non - hermitian @xmath150 matrix .",
    "the eigenenergies of this matrix are complex numbers . according to the accepted terminology",
    ", their real parts represent the positions of the resonances ( poles ) , in the complex energy plane .",

    "the st occurs when these resonances begin to interact ( overlap ) . in this case",
    ", the superradiant eigenstates accumulate large decay widths .",
    "so , these superradiant states contribute coherently to the radiation into the continuum spectra ( sinks ) .",
    "all other eigenstates ( sub - radiant ) have small decay widths , and are long - lived .",
    "however , for some range of parameters , the superradiant eigenstates become localized at the sites which do not overlap with those sites which are initially populated . in this case , the superradiant eigenstates practically do not contribute to the st ( in spite of the fact that these eigenstates have the largest decay widths ) .",
    "this competition between the decay widths and the delocalization of the superradiant eigenstates is well - know in the field of the sr .",
    "since our model includes two sinks , two sts occur for different values of parameters .",
    "one st occurs in the damaging channel , and the other occurs in the charge transfer channel .",
    "this latter one contributes to the npq mechanism .",
    "the efficiency of the npq by the cts mainly depends on two factors : the et rate to the sink connected to the site of the cts , and on the probability accumulated at the excitonic site , where the cts is localized .",
    "when the et rate to the sink associated with the cts is small , the npq efficiency is also small .",
    "however , when this et rate is very large , the superradiant eigenstate becomes strongly localized at the excitonic cts , and it practically does not overlap with the initially populated chlorophyll dimer . then , the npq efficiency is also suppressed in this case . only for the intermediate values of the et rate in the sink associated with the cts ,",
    "does the npq efficiency approaches its maximum .",
    "we demonstrated that the maximum of the npq efficiency is caused by the st to the sink associated with the cts .",
    "however , experimental verifications are required in order to determine whether or not the npq regime is associated with the st transition for real photosynthetic complexes .",
    "indeed , it can happen that , in the photosynthetic apparatus , the npq regime occurs in the  non - optimal \" region of parameters , and it could be independent of the st .",
    "the results obtained in this paper can easily be generalized to more complicated networks of interacting chlorophyll and carotenoid light - sensitive molecules , and for more complicated random protein environments .",
    "the experimental verification of the relation between the npq and the st phenomena would be of significant interest for both better understanding of the npq mechanisms and for bio- and nano - engineering .",

    "<S> , the damaging channels are partly suppressed , and the excessive sunlight energy is transfered to the non - damaging , quenching channel(s ) , that are opened in this regime .    in modeling the npq mechanisms , </S>",
    "<S> it is possible to characterize the sites of the lhcs by the discrete excitonic energy states , @xmath0 , @xmath1 being the number of site , associated with the light - sensitive chlorophyll or carotenoid molecule . </S>",
    "<S> then , both the damaging and undamaging channels can be characterized by their corresponding sinks , @xmath2 , that provide independent continuum electron energy spectra @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these sinks can have very complex structures , and they can be responsible for primary charge separation processes , as in the photosynthetic reaction centers ( rcs ) @xcite , for creation of charge transfer states , for singlet oxygen production @xcite , and for many other quasi - reversible chemical reactions . </S>",
    "<S> generally , a particular sink , @xmath2 , is connected to a particular site , @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> the energy transfer from this state to its sink is characterized by the electron transfer ( et ) rate , @xmath3 . for those sites which are not connected to sinks , </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding et rates vanish . under reasonable assumptions , </S>",
    "<S> this type of model can be described by an effective non - hermitian hamiltonian @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> then , this approach becomes similar to those used in describing the so - called  superradiance transition \" ( st ) in systems in which the discrete ( intrinsic ) energy states interact with the continuum spectra @xcite . in these systems , </S>",
    "<S> the st usually occurs when the resonances start to overlap . </S>",
    "<S> namely , when the half - sum of the imaginary parts of the neighboring eigenenergies ( decay widths ) becomes of the order of the spacing between the resonances ( distance between the real parts of the neighboring eigenenergies ) .    for small et rates , the decay widths are small , and resonances are isolated </S>",
    "<S> . however , if the @xmath3 approach critical values , at which the resonances begin to overlap , then a segregation of the widths occurs . in this case , most of the decay width is allocated to a few short - lived  superradiant \" states , while all other states become long - lived ( and effectively decoupled from the environment ) . </S>",
    "<S> this segregation is called the st . </S>",
    "<S> the st is a quantum coherent effect and , in biological systems , it should be considered ( see , for example , @xcite ) in close relation to the quantum coherent effects studied recently in the photosynthetic complexes @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> it is important to note , that in many systems the occurrence of the st requires not only the overlapping of the neighboring resonances , but also a delocalization of the eigenfunctions which are involved in the st . </S>",
    "<S> this is especially important for those systems in which the initial wave function does not sufficiently overlap with those eigenfunctions which are responsible for the sr ( see below ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the st has been well - studied in random matrix theory @xcite , nuclear physics @xcite , microwave billiards @xcite , and in paradigmatic models of coherent quantum transport @xcite . in particular , it was shown in @xcite that , for a realistic model for quantum transport , maximum transmission is achieved at the st . in biological systems , </S>",
    "<S> the st has previously been discussed in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> ( see also references therein . )    in this paper , we numerically study the possible role of the st in the npq mechanism in the lhcs of photosystem ii ( psii ) . for concreteness </S>",
    "<S> , we apply our approach to the npq protocol discussed in @xcite . according to @xcite , the npq mechanism </S>",
    "<S> is associated with charge transfer quenching . </S>",
    "<S> it takes place in part in the lhc cp29 minor lhc , which is located ( with other minor lhcs ) between the rc and the peripheral lhcii complex @xcite . in the npq mechanism , discussed in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> the following basic components are involved : a dimer based on two chlorophylls with their excited states , @xmath4 and @xmath5 ; the heterodimer , @xmath6 , where the carotenoid zeaxanthin , @xmath7 , is formed in the npq regime ; the charge transfer state ( cts ) of this heterodimer , @xmath8 ; and the damaging channel , which is responsible for production of the singlet oxygen and other damaging products . </S>",
    "<S> our model ( see also @xcite ) includes five discrete energy levels ( sites ) , each for a mentioned above component . </S>",
    "<S> each of two discrete levels , associated with the cts and with the damaging channel , is connected to its corresponding independent sink , which is described by the continuum electron spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> both these sinks are responsible for the quasi - reversible chemical reactions . according to @xcite , in the npq regime , the extra sunlight energy , that is absorbed by lhc , </S>",
    "<S> is transfered to the cts , and then it partly dissipates into the protein environment .    in our model , all five discrete states and two sinks </S>",
    "<S> are embedded in the protein environment , which we model by a random telegraph process ( rtp ) . in @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> our model was used to simulate numerically the efficiency of the npq regime , at various parameters of the system . in the present paper , we extend the application of our model to describe the possible role of the st in the npq regime . </S>",
    "<S> our mathematical approach is based on a non - hermitian hamiltonian which naturally occurs and is a standard mathematical tool used for studying the st in many physical and biological systems . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that , for reasonable conditions , the npq mechanism can be associated with the st in the charge transfer channel . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the st can optimize the performance of the npq mechanism . </S>"
