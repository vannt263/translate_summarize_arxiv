    "vacuum does not like matter , in which matter has so many possible states that can oscillate in many frequencies .",
    "the vacuum energy can not contain contributions from all arbitrary wavelengths , except those physically existed states that are permitted by the hamiltonian , e.g. to calculate the summation of states , we made the following assumptions :    \\1 ) the only contribution to the vacuum energy comes from the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the higgs mechanism ; which means we do not care any other possible sources .",
    "vacuum has only two states : unbroken state and broken state , which will be the only two permitted states that appeared in the summation .",
    "because the vacuum unbroken state has the energy @xmath121 , so the only state left in the summation is the vacuum broken state .",

    "a possible explanation is that @xmath126 is only occurred after symmetry breaking .",

    "the mass of the universe is proportional to the square of the universe s age : @xmath134 .",
    "according to dirac , the continuous creation of mass maybe either of two models .",
