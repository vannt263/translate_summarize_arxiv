    "k \" ahler@xcite has shown how to pack the dirac wave function into the language of differential forms in the sense that the dirac equation is an equation in which a linear operator acts on a linear combination @xmath0 of @xmath1-forms ( p=0 , 1 , ... , d ; here d = dimension = 4 ) .",
    "this is the dirac - k \" ahler formalism .",
    "one of us@xcite has long developed an a priori rather different formalism in an attempt to unify spin and charges . in this approach",
    "the spin degrees of freedom come out of canonically quantizing certain grassmannian odd ( position analogue in the sense of being on an analogue footing with @xmath2 ) variables @xmath3 .",
    "these variables are denoted by a vector index @xmath4 , and there are at first to see no spinors at all !    one of the main purposes of the present article is to point out the analogy and nice relations between the two different ways of achieving the - almost miraculous - appearance of spin one half degrees of freedom in spite of starting from pure vectors and tensors .    of course it is a priori impossible that vectorial and tensorial fields ( or degrees of freedom ) can be converted into spinorial ones without some  cheat  . the",
    " cheat  consists really in exchanging one set of lorentz transformation generators by another set ( which indeed means putting strongly to zero one type of grassmann odd operators fulfilling the clifford algebra and anticommuting with another type of grassmann odd operators , which also fulfill the clifford algebra@xcite ) .",
    "in fact one finds on page 512 in the k \" ahlers@xcite article that there are two sets of rotation generators ; one set for which the @xmath0 field ( in the k \" ahler s notation ) transforms as a spinor field and another one for which it transforms as superpositions of vector and ( antisymmetric ) tensor fields .",
    "analogously in the approach of one of us the apriori lorentz transformation generators @xmath5 have the wave function transform as vectors and antisymmetric tensors , while @xmath6 ( @xmath7 $ ] ) or @xmath8 ( @xmath9 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] means the commutator ) used alone are also possible lorentz generators for which now the wave function transforms as a spinor wave function . by putting @xmath11 ( which has the property that @xmath12 = 0 $ ] ) equal strongly to zero",
    "is the same as replacing @xmath13 by @xmath14 .    in both approaches to get spinors out of vectors and antisymmetric tensors , as start , you get not only one but several copies , families , of dirac fields .",
    "this is a fundamental feature in as far as these different families are connected by the generator parts not used : if one for instance uses @xmath6 as the lorentz generator to get spinors , then the not used part @xmath15 transforms the families ( of the same grassmann character ) into each other .",
    "it will be a major content of the present article to bring about a dictionary relating the two formalisms so that one can enjoy the simplicity of one also working on the other one .",
    "we also shall generalize the k \" ahler operators for @xmath16 , comment on the discrete symmetries , which in the one of us approach show up clearly and use the @xmath17 dimensions to describe spins and charges@xcite .",
    "in the following section we shall put forward the little part of the formalism of the work of one of us needed for the comparison with the dirac - k \" ahler formalism .    in the next section again - section 3 - we",
    "shall then tell the ( usual ) dirac - k \" ahler formalism as far as relevant .    the comparison which should now be rather obvious",
    "is performed in section 4 .    in section 5",
    "we shall analyse in the two approaches in parallel how the remarkable finding of the dirac equation inside a purely tensorial - vectorial system of fields occurs .",
    "in section 6 we shall comment on the evenness of the @xmath18 matrices , which have to transform grassmann odd wave functions into grassmann odd wave functions .",
    "in section 7 we shall comment on discrete symmetries for either k \" ahler or the one of us approach , also discussing the realization of the discrete symmetries pointed up clearly by weinberg in his book@xcite on pages 100 - 105 .",
    "in section 8 we want to investigate how unavoidable the appearance of families is to this type of approaches .    in section 9",
    "we shall look at how the ideas of one of us of extra dimensions generalizes the k \" ahler approach .",
    "in section 10 we discuss the nielsen and ninomija  @xcite no go theorem for spinors on a lattice and a possible way out .    in section 11 we shall resume and deliver concluding remarks .",
    "what we can call the manko approach@xcite , and which is the work of one of us , is a rather ambitious model for going beyond the standard model with say 10 ( or more ) extra dimensions , but what we need for the present connection with the dirac - k \" ahler@xcite formalism is only the way in which the spin part of the dirac particle fields comes about .",
    "the total number of dimensions in the model is ( most hopefully ) 13 + 1 bosonic degrees of freedom , i.e. normal dimensions , and the same number of fermionic ones .",
    "let us call the dimension of space - time @xmath19 and then the dirac spinor degrees of freedom shall come from the odd grassmannian variables @xmath20 .    in wanting to quantize or just to make poisson brackets out of the @xmath19 @xmath3 s we have two choices since we could either decide to make the different @xmath3 s their own conjugate , so that one only has @xmath21 degrees of freedom - this is the approach of ravndal and divecchia@xcite - or we could decide to consider the @xmath3 s configuration space variables only . in the latter case - which is the mankov",
    "c case - we have then from the @xmath3 s different conjugate variables @xmath22 .",
    "in this latter case we are entitled to write wave functions of the form @xmath23 this is the only form a function of the odd grassmannian variables @xmath3 can take .",
    "thus the wave function space here has dimension @xmath24 .",
    "completely analogously to usual quantum mechanics we have the operator for the conjugate variable @xmath3 to be @xmath25 the right arrow here just tells , that the derivation has to be performed from the left hand side .",
    "these operators then obey the odd heisenberg algebra , which written by means of the generalized commutators @xmath26 where @xmath27 takes the form @xmath28 here @xmath29 is the flat metric @xmath30 .    for later use we shall define the operators @xmath31 for which we can show that the @xmath32 s among themselves fulfill the clifford algebra as do also the @xmath11 s , while they mutually anticommute : @xmath33 note that the linear combinations ( [ eq6 ] ) presuppose a metric tensor , since otherwise only @xmath3 and @xmath34 but not @xmath35 and @xmath36 are defined .",
    "we could recognize formally @xmath37 as the dirac - like equation , because of the above generalized commutation relations . applying either the operator @xmath38 or @xmath39 on the two equations ( eqs.([d ] ) ) we get the klein - gordon equation @xmath40 .",
    "here of course we defined @xmath41 however , it is rather obvious that these equations ( [ d ] ) are not dirac equations in the sense of the wave function transforming as a spinor , w.r.t . to the generators for the lorentz transformations ,",
    "if taken as usual @xmath42 however it is easily seen that we can write these generators as the sum @xmath43 where we have defined @xmath44 , \\quad   \\tilde{\\tilde{s } } { } ^{ab } : = -\\frac{i}{4}[\\tilde{\\tilde{a } } {   } ^a,\\tilde{\\tilde{a } } { } ^b ] ,     \\label{s}\\ ] ] with @xmath45:=ab - ba$ ] .",
    "one can now easily see that the solutions of the two equations ( [ d ] ) now transform as spinors with respect to either @xmath46 or @xmath47    it is of great importance for the  trick  of manipulating what we shall consider to be the lorentz transformations and thus to be able to make the  miraculous  shifts of lorentz representation that is the somewhat remarkable characteristic of the k \" ahler type of shift in formulation interpretation , that both - untilded , the single tilded and the double tilded - @xmath13 obey the @xmath19-dimensional lorentz generator algebra @xmath48 , when inserted for @xmath49",
    ".    really the  cheat ",
    "consist -as we shall return to - in replacing the lorentz generators by the @xmath6 , say . this",
    " means indeed that for this choice the operators @xmath50 have to be put strongly to zero in the generators of the lorentz transformations ( eq.([vecs ] , [ vecsp ] , [ s ] ) ) as well as in all the other operators , representing the physical quantities .",
    "we shall present the one of us approach in further details in section 4 pointing out the similarities between this approach and the k \" ahler approach and generalizing the k \" ahler approach .",
    "the k \" ahler formulation@xcite takes its starting point by considering p - forms in the @xmath19-dimensional space , @xmath51 elegantly , the 1-forms say are defined as dual vectors to the ( local ) tangent spaces , and the higher p - forms can then be defined as antisymmetrized cartesian ( exterior ) products of the one - form spaces , and the 0-forms are the scalars ; but we can perhaps more concretely think about the p - forms as formal linear combinations of the differentials of the coordinates @xmath52 : a general linear combination of forms is then written @xmath53 where the p - form is of the form @xmath54",
    "@xmath55    then one can define both the presumably most well known exterior algebra denoted by the exterior product @xmath56 and the clifford product @xmath57 among the forms .",
    "the wedge product @xmath56 has the property of making the product of a p - form and a q - form be a ( p+q)-form , if a p - form and a q - form have no common differentials .",
    "the clifford product @xmath58 on a p - form is either a @xmath59 form , if a p - form does not include a one form @xmath52 , or a @xmath60 form , if a one form @xmath52 is included in a p - form .",
    "actually k \" ahler found how the dirac equation could be written as an equation@xcite ( eq .",
    "( 26.6 ) in the k \" ahler s paper ) @xmath61 where the symbol @xmath0 stands for a linear combination of @xmath1-forms ( eq.([u ] ) ) and @xmath62 with d being the dimension of space - time , namely d = 4 for the k \" ahler s case .",
    "further in the notation of k \" ahler the symbol , as k \" ahler does in his paper , but @xmath63 of k \" ahler is in the becher and joos paper replaced by @xmath64 , which means that in their paper @xmath65 . ] @xmath63 denotes inner differentiation , which means the analogue of the exterior differential @xmath19 but with the use of the clifford product @xmath57 instead of the exterior product @xmath66 @xmath67 the symbol @xmath68 determines the coupling of the charge with the electromagnetic field @xmath69 and @xmath70 means the electron mass , the symbol @xmath71 transforms a @xmath1-form into @xmath72-form , if the @xmath1-form includes @xmath73 , otherwise it gives zero .    for a free massless particle living in a d dimensional space - time -",
    "this is what interests us in this paper since the mass term brings no new feature in the theory - eq.([dk1 ] ) can be rewritten in the form    @xmath74    where the symbol @xmath0 stands again for a linear combination of @xmath1-forms ( p = 0,1,2,3,5, ...",
    ",d ) .    that is to say that the wave function describing the state of the spin one half particle is packed into the exterior algebra function @xmath0 .",
    "more about the k \" ahler s approach will come in section 4 giving the correspondence between that and the one with the grassmann @xmath3 s , where we shall also give some generalizations .",
    "we demonstrate the parallelism between the k \" ahler@xcite and the one of us@xcite approach in steps , paying attention on the becher - joos@xcite paper as well .",
    "first we shall treat the spin @xmath75 fields only , as k \" ahler did .",
    "we shall use the simple and transparent definition of the exterior and interior product in grassmann space to generalize the k \" ahler approach to two kinds of @xmath63 ( eq.([dk0 ] ) ) operators on the space of p - forms and then accordingly to three kinds of the generators of the lorentz transformations , two of the spinorial and one of the vectorial character , the first kind transforming spinor @xmath75 fields , the second one transforming the vector fields .",
    "we comment on the hodge star product for both approaches , define the scalar product of vectors in the vector space of either p - forms or of polynomials of @xmath3 s and comment on four replications of the weyl bi - spinor .",
    "we also discuss briefly the vector representations in both approaches .",
    "we present here , side by side , the operators in the space of differential forms and in the space of polynomials of @xmath76 s .",
    "we present the exterior product @xmath77 the operator of  differentiation  @xmath78 and",
    "the two superpositions of the above operators @xmath79 @xmath80 here @xmath81 stays instead of @xmath57 of eq.([dk1 ] ) , used by k \" ahler . introducing the notation with @xmath82 and @xmath83 we not only point out the similarities between the two approaches but also the two possibilities for the clifford product - only one of them used by k \" ahler .",
    "both @xmath84 and @xmath85 are clifford products on p - forms , while @xmath32 @xmath11 are the corresponding linear operators operating on the space of polynomials of @xmath3 s .",
    "one easily finds the commutation relations , if for both approaches the generalized form of commutators , presented in eq.([gen ] ) , are understood @xmath86 @xmath87 here @xmath29 is the metric of space - time .",
    "the vacuum state @xmath88 is defined as @xmath89 @xmath90 now we can define the dirac - like equations for both approaches : @xmath91 @xmath92 since @xmath93 and @xmath94 , while @xmath95 and @xmath96 , it is obvious that @xmath97 plays in the p - form formalism the role of the derivative with respect to a differential @xmath98form , similarly as @xmath99 does with respect to a grassmann coordinate .",
    "taking into account the above definitions , one easily finds that @xmath100 @xmath101    both vectors , the @xmath0 , which are the superpositions of differential p - forms and the @xmath102 , which are polynomials in @xmath103 s are defined in a similar way ( eqs .",
    "( [ * ] , [ up ] ) ) , as we shall point out in the following subsection .",
    "we see that either @xmath104 or @xmath105 similarly as either @xmath106 or @xmath107 can represent the dirac - like equation .      the superpositions of p - forms on which the dirac - k \" ahler equation is defined and the superpositions of polynomials in grassmann space , on which the dirac - like equations are defined , are @xmath108 @xmath109 the coefficients @xmath110 depend on coordinates @xmath2 in both cases and are antisymmetric tensors of the rank @xmath111 with respect to indices @xmath112 .",
    "the vector space is in both cases @xmath113 dimensional .",
    "both , @xmath115 and @xmath116 define the algebra of the @xmath18 matrices and so they do both @xmath117 and @xmath118 .",
    "one would thus be tempted to identify @xmath119    but there is a large freedom in defining what to identify with the gamma - matrices , because except when using @xmath120 as a parity operation you have an even number of gamma matrices occurring in the physical applications . then you may multiply all the gamma matrices by some factor provided it does not disturb their algebra nor their even products .",
    "we shall comment this point in section 6 .",
    "this freedom might be used to solve , what seems a problem : having an odd grassmann character , neither @xmath32 nor @xmath11 should be recognized as the dirac @xmath18 operators , since they would change , when operating on polynomials of @xmath3 , polynomials of an odd grassmann character to polynomials of an even grassmann character .",
    "one would , however , expect - since grassmann odd fields second quantize to fermions , while grassmann even fields second quantize to bosons - that the @xmath18 operators do not change the grassmann character of wave functions .",
    "one can notice , that similarly to the grassmann case , also the two types of the clifford products defined on p - forms , change the oddness or the evenness of the p - forms : an even p - form , @xmath121 , is changed by either @xmath115 or @xmath122 to an odd @xmath123-form , with either @xmath124 , if @xmath125 is not included in a p - form , or @xmath126 , if @xmath52 is included in a @xmath1-form , while an odd p - form , @xmath127 , is changed to an even @xmath59-form or @xmath128-form .",
    "we shall later therefore propose that accordingly @xmath129 are recognized as the dirac @xmath18 operators operating on the space of @xmath1-forms or polynomials of @xmath3 s , respectively , since they both have an even grassmann character and they both fulfill the clifford algebra @xmath130 of course , the role of @xmath131 and @xmath132 can in either the k \" ahler case or the case of polynomials in grassmann space , be exchanged .",
    "whether we define the gamma - matrices by ( [ eq25 ] ) or ( [ naive ] ) makes only a difference for an odd products of gamma - matrices , but for applications such as construction of currents @xmath133 or for the lorentz generators on the spinors @xmath134 $ ] only products of even numbers of gamma - matrices occur , except for the parity representation on the dirac fields , where the @xmath120-matrix is used alone .",
    "this @xmath120-matrix has to simulate the parity reflection which is either @xmath135 the  ugly  gamma - matrix identifications ( [ eq25 ] ) indeed perform this operation . and",
    "as long as the physical applications are the ones just mentioned - and that should be sufficient - the choice ( [ eq25 ] ) is satisfactory : living in the grassmann odd part of the hilbert space , we do nt move into the grassmann even part of it .",
    "the canonical quantization of grassmann odd fields , that is the procedure with the hamiltonian and the poisson brackets , then automatically assures the anticommuting relations between the operators of the fermionic fields .",
    "the simplest solution to the problem with the evenness and oddness is to use the  naive  gamma - matrix identifications ( [ naive ] ) and simply ignore that the even - odd - ness does not match .",
    "this is what k \" ahler did , we can say , in as far as he did not really identify the even - odd - ness of the p - forms with the statistics of dirac fields . if one - along the lines of the becher s and joos s paper ( @xcite ) - will make a second quantized theory based on the k \" ahler trick one does not proceed by insisting on taking p - forms to be fermionic only when p is odd . becher and joos take all the forms as fermion fields and assume then anticommuting relations for operators of fields .",
    "this simplest solution can thus be claimed to be the one applied by k \" ahler and used by becher and joos : they simply do not dream about in advance postulating that the p - forms should necessarily be taken to be boson or fermion fields depending on whether p is even or odd .",
    "it is only when one as one of us in her model has the requirement of canonical quantization saying that the @xmath3 s should be grassmann odd objects , which indeed they are , that the problem occurs .",
    "again , we are presenting the generators of the lorentz transformations of spinors for both approaches @xmath136 differing among themselves in the definition of @xmath13 only , which define the generators of the lorentz transformations in the internal space , that is in the space of @xmath1-forms or polynomials of @xmath3 s , respectively . while k \" ahler suggested the definition @xmath137 in the grassmann case  @xcite the operator @xmath138 is one of the two generators defined above ( eq .",

    "following the definitions in the one of us  @xcite approach , one can write the @xmath13 for the k \" ahler case @xmath141 =   -\\frac{i}{4 } [ \\tilde{\\gamma}^a , \\tilde{\\gamma}^b ] ,   \\quad { \\rm or } \\quad \\tilde{\\tilde{\\cal s } } { } ^{ab } =   \\frac{i}{4 } [ dx^a\\ ; \\wedge -\\ ; e^a    , \\ ; dx^b \\ ; \\wedge - \\;e^b ] .   \\label{eq31}\\ ] ] not only are in this case the similarities between the two approaches more transparent , also the definition of the generators of the lorentz transformations in the space of p - forms simplifies very much .",

    "the above equation is true for both approaches and the generators of the lorentz transformations @xmath49 fulfill the lorentz algebra in both cases .",
    "in addition , the operators of the lorentz transformations with the vectorial character can also be defined for both approaches in an equivalent way , that is as a sum of the two operators of the spinorial character @xmath143 which again fulfill the lorentz algebra .",
    "the operator @xmath144 if being applied on differential p - forms , transforms vectors into vectors , correspondingly @xmath145 , if being applied to polynomial of @xmath3 s transforms vectors into vectors  @xcite .",
    "elements of the lorentz group can be written for both approaches , for either spinorial or vectorial kind of the generators as @xmath146 where @xmath147 are parameters of the group .",
    "if @xmath49 are equal to either @xmath148 or @xmath149 , the period of transformations is @xmath150 either in the space of differential forms or in the grassmann space , demonstrating the spinorial character of the operator .",
    "if @xmath49 is the sum of @xmath151 and @xmath152 , the period of transformation is @xmath153 , manifesting the vectorial character of the operator .      in the way how we have defined the operators in the space of @xmath1-form , the definition of the `` hodge star '' operator , defined by k \" ahler working in the space of p - forms and the space of @xmath3 polynomials",
    ", will be respectively @xmath154 with @xmath155 equal to either @xmath156 in the k \" ahler case , or to @xmath157 in the one of us  @xcite approach .",
    "for an even d the factor with double tilde ( @xmath158 ) can be in both cases omitted ( @xmath159 , again we could distinguish the operators @xmath160 and @xmath161 in both cases , according to the elements , which define the casimir ) .",
    "it follows that @xmath162 are the two operators , which when being applied on wave functions defined either on p - forms or on polynomials in grassmann space , project out the left or right handed component , respectively .",
    "one easily recognizes that when being applied on a vacuum state @xmath163 , the operator @xmath160 behaves as a `` hodge star '' product , since one finds for @xmath19 even @xmath164      in the manko s approach  @xcite the scalar product between the two functions @xmath165 and @xmath166 is defined as follows @xmath167 here @xmath168 is the weight function @xmath169 which operates on the first function , @xmath170 , only while @xmath171 no summation over repeated index is meant and @xmath172 since @xmath173 , @xmath174 means the complex conjugation and @xmath175 means the hermitian conjugation , then with respect to the above defined scalar product the operator @xmath176 @xmath177 while @xmath178 and @xmath179 .",

    "one can write down the matrix representation for this second kind of the time - reversal transformation .",
    "if we choose for the basis the first copy of bispinors of table i. and the fourth copy of bispinors of table i , we obtain the matrix : @xmath344 where the @xmath345 , due to the choice of the phase of the spinors in table i. , and @xmath346 means that the complex conjugation has to be performed on the phase coefficients only , which in our case have again been chosen to be one .",
    "this is the time - reversal operation discussed by weinberg  @xcite in appendix c of the weinberg s book .",
    "when vectors and scalars are treated in the similar way for either of the two approaches , it turns out that the time - reversal operators do not transform one copy into another one .",

    "the complex conjugation affects , of course , the higher part of the internal space as well , affecting the charges of spinors , vectors and tensors , if one thinks of the extension  @xcite as discussed in section 9 .",
    "we want to look at the funny shift of the spin compared to the a priori spin for a field by shifting a priori generators @xmath347 out by anther set @xmath348 as a general nice idea .",
    "a prerequisite for that working is that the difference between the two proposals for lorentz generators @xmath349 is also a conserved set of quantities . in the notation above of course",
    "we find @xmath350    assuming that there is indeed such two lorentz generator symmetries in a model , we can ask for the representation under both for a given set of fields , and we can even ask for representation under the difference algebra @xmath351 . in order to shift in going from @xmath49 to @xmath352 from integer spin to half integer spin",
    "the representation for the fields in question must at least be spin 1/2 for @xmath351 . actually in the cases we discussed the @xmath351 were in the dirac spinor representation .",
    "but that means that the representation of the fields which shift representation going from @xmath49 to @xmath352 have to belong under @xmath351 to at least a spin 1/2 which means at least the weyl spin representation of the lorentz group , and that has @xmath353 dimensions . but",
    "that means then that a given representation of the final @xmath352 lorentz group always must occur in at least @xmath354 families .",
    "we have discussed the connection between the grassmann @xmath3 formulation and the k \" ahler formalism for general dimension @xmath19 and thus we could apply it simply in the d=4 case , or we could use it in extended models with extra dimensions .",
    "one should note that the connection between the spinor and the forms is such that for each extra two dimensions the number of components of a dirac - spinor goes up by a factor 2 , and at the same time the number of families also doubles .",
    "this agrees with that adding one extra @xmath3 doubles the number of terms in the @xmath3 polynomials and thus adding two would make this number four times as big .",
    "let us now study the application of the extra degrees of freedom which consists in supposing the k \" ahler degrees of freedom or equivalently the grassmann @xmath3 s we discussed to the case where the @xmath19 dimensional space is used in a kaluza - klein type model .",
    "that is to say we here look at a kaluza - klein model extended with @xmath3 s or the forms , much more rich than usual kaluza - klein .",
    "it has long been suggested  @xcite that special kinds of rotations of the spins especially in the extra @xmath355 dimensions manifest themselves as generators for charges observable at the end for the four dimensional particles . since both the extra dimension spin degrees of freedom and the ordinary spin degrees of freedom originate from the @xmath3 s or the forms we have a unification of these internal degrees of freedom .",
    "we can say then that the generators rotating these degrees of freedom , namely the just mentioned charges acting as hinger dimensional spins ( at high energy ) and the 4-dimensional spin , are unified .    such rotations of the internal spin degrees of freedom would in order to correspond to a kaluza - klein gauge fields with massless gauge bosons have to represent full symmetries of the vacuum state , i.e. they should as in usual kaluza - klein correspond to killing - vectors , but with the further degrees of freedom also corresponding to symmetry for the latter .",
    "so at the end we may consider also the charges associated with the internal spin as ordinary klauza - klein charges , of course in the sense of being for the very rich model considered here .",
    "but of course unless we have the @xmath3 or forms degrees of freedom one could risk that the gauge field from such symmetry could be practically decoupled .",
    "let us now look at what the  families  found in the dirac - k \" ahler will develop into in case we use it for a kaluza - klein type model , as just proposed : usually the number of surviving massless fermions into the ( 3 + 1 ) space consists only of those which are connected with ",
    "zero - modes  .",
    "this is to be understood so that we imagine weyl particles in the high ( @xmath19 ) dimensional space because of an atiah - singer theorem in @xmath355 dimensional  staying compactified",
    " space ensures some modes with the extra dimension part of the dirac operator gets zero for some number of modes - for each @xmath19-dimensional family .    if the model had a strength for compact space atiah - singer theorem @xmath356 and if the dimension of the full space , the number of @xmath3 s , is @xmath19 , so that the number of families at the @xmath19-dimensional level becomes @xmath248 , the total number of at low energy observable  families  should be @xmath357    as an example take the model  @xcite which has @xmath358 and at first - at the high energy level - @xmath359 lorentz group , but which should be broken to ( in two steps ) to first @xmath360 and then to @xmath361 .",
    "we may see the appearance of equally many ( namely @xmath362 ) right handed and left handed ",
    "flavours  in the k \" ahler model as an expression for the no go theorem@xcite for putting chiral charge conserving fermions on the lattice in as far as we could make attempts to make lattice fermions along the lines of becher and joos  @xcite .",
    "in fact it would of course have been a counterexample to the no go  @xcite theorem if there had been a different number of right and of left weyl particle species in the becher - joos model , because in the free model the number of particles functions as a conserved charge .",
    "as is very well known the becher - joos model really is just the kogut - susskind  @xcite lattice fermion model , it is also well known that it does not violate the no go theorem  @xcite and this is because there is this species doubling , which can be interpreted as the flavours .    becher and joos show that the kogut - susskind lattice description of dirac fields is equivalent to the lattice approximation of the dirac - k \" ahler equation .",
    "( see page 344 in the becher - joos@xcite article ) .",
    "this kogut - susskind model is one that gives us dirac particles , but we can seek to get to weyl particles in a naive @xmath363 ( or @xmath204 or @xmath364 in the usual notation ) projecting way , but of course now such a projection would have to be translated into the language with the vector and scalar fields in the k \" ahler s formulation , and it is rather easy to see  @xcite that requiring only one @xmath363 projection implies that the coefficient to one p - form say @xmath365 should relate ( just by a sign @xmath366 ) to that of the by the hodge star @xmath367 associated @xmath368 ( see subsection 4.5 ) . actually we easily see that requiring the restriction that @xmath369 in the language of k \" ahler becomes @xmath370    if we want like joos and becher to put the theory on the lattice there is a difficulty in just imposing this constraint , because the natural relation imposed by the hodge star @xmath367 on the lattice would go from lattice to the dual lattice and we could not identify without a somewhat ambiguous choice the @xmath367dual of a given lattice element , so as to impose the  self duality  condition .",
    "could we possibly invent a way to circumvent the no go theorem  @xcite for chirality conserving fermions on the lattice by making the species doublers bosons instead of fermions , both having though spin 1/2 ?    in the formulation by one of us which we have related to the k \" ahler formulation there is ( naturally ) assigned different grassmanian character to different components of the wave function .",
    "in fact the wave function with coefficients to monomial terms that are products of different sets of ( mutually different ) @xmath3-variables - in the sense of course that a polynomial is given by its coefficients - , and thus the coefficients to the products with an even number of factors have different grassmannian character from those of the odd number of factors .",
    "that actually is in the theory of one of us somewhat of an embarrassing reason for a super selection rule , which though may be overcome by taking into account the charges related to extra dimensions appearing in that model .",
    "but here we now want to point out the hope that these very grassmann character problems may be used as a new idea to circumvent the no go theorem .",
    "in fact we could hope for that spin @xmath371 and say left handed flavour appear with fermionic statistics ( the grassmann odd character ) while spin @xmath371 flavour with bosonic statistics would appear as right handed , and that even on the lattice .",
    "the way that manko  @xcite chooses to quantize the system , that is a particle moving in ordinary and grassmann coordinate space , is to let the wave function be allowed to be any function of the @xmath19 gassmann variables @xmath3 , so that any such function represents a state of the system . but in this quantization the @xmath11 s can not be put weakly to zero . in other words that quantization turned out not to obey the equation expected from expression for the canonical momentum @xmath22 , being proportional to the coordinate @xmath3 as derived from the lagrangian . if , however , in the operators such as the hamiltonian and the lorentz transformation operators @xmath11 s are just put strongly to zero , so that all the operators only depend on @xmath32 , while either @xmath117 or @xmath372 fulfill the clifford algebra : @xmath373 and @xmath374 , the expressions obtained after having put the @xmath11 s to zero describe spinor degrees of freedom . in particular , only the operators @xmath6 are used as the lorentz generator .",
    "one has accordingly the new lorentz transformations instead of the a priori one in the wave function on grassmann space quantization used . in that case",
    "the argument for only having integer spin breaks down , what the calculations indeed confirm to happen .",
    "we should now attempt to get an understanding of what goes on here by using a basis inspired from the dirac - k \" ahler - construction , which is a way often used on lattices to implement fermions on the lattice .",
    "the dirac - k \" ahler construction starts from a field theory with a series of fields which are 0-form , 1-form , 2-form , ... , d - form .",
    "they can be thought of as being expanded on a basis of all the wedge product combinations of the basis @xmath375 , @xmath376 , ... , @xmath377 for the one - forms , including wedge products from zero factors to d factors . in the dirac - k \"",
    "ahler construction one succeeds in constructing out of these `` all types of forms '' @xmath248 dirac spinor fields .",
    "this construction is without a  cheat ",
    "impossible in much the same way as manko s approach ought to be .",
    "we have pointed out clearly in this paper how this  cheat",
    " occurs in both approaches , showing up all the similarities of the two approaches and using the simple presentation of the quantum mechanics in grassmann space to not only simplify the dirac - k \" ahler approach but also to generalize it .",
    "we have shown in particular that in both approaches besides the ( two kinds of ) generators for the lorentz transformations for spinors also the generators for vectors and tensors exist .",
    "there are four copies of the weyl bispinors .",
    "one kind of the spinorial type of the lorentz transformations defines the weyl spinors , another kind transforms one copy of weyl spinors into another of the same grassmann character .",
