    "the first discussion of jet quenching in quark - gluon plasma dates back almost 30 years . in a paper by bjorken  @xcite",
    ", elastic scattering from `` quanta in the plasma '' was considered as a possible mechanism for differential energy loss of high - energy quarks and gluons , leading to a modification of the jet structure in high - energy hadronic collisions .",
    "ten years later first quantitative predictions were given in a perturbative qcd - based approach  @xcite , indicating that the dominant energy loss mechanism is radiative and leads to a significant suppression of hadron production in central nucleus - nucleus collisions at high transverse momentum @xmath3 .",
    "another decade later , at quark matter 2001 , the first experimental evidence for jet quenching was presented by the rhic collaborations  @xcite .",
    "it is remarkable that these very early data already revealed the essence of the phenomenon , which is valid to date : at large transverse momentum , hadrons are suppressed by a factor five in central au ",

    "all these results substantiate the early findings . on the theoretical side",
    "the situation is less clear .",
    "there exist quite a few models which give a good description of the experimental results , however , the extraction of the relevant medium properties from these data is still ambiguous ( see e.g.@xcite for a recent review ) .    at this quark matter conference , yet another ten years after the experimental discovery of jet quenching at rhic , first results from lhc are presented . owing to the increase of collision energy by more than an order of magnitude as compared to rhic ,",
    "the production of high-@xmath3 particles at lhc is much more abundant , giving rise to the expectation that lhc data on particle production at high @xmath3 will substantially improve the experimental constraints on energy loss models and allow for a more precise determination of the medium parameters . a first impression was given by alice presenting the inclusive charged particle spectra in central pb ",

    "the results are based on data from the first heavy - ion campaign at the lhc in the fall of 2010 , where alice recorded about 30 m minimum bias pb  pb events .",
    "nuclear modifications of particle production in aa are commonly expressed in terms of the nuclear modification factor : @xmath12 the construction of @xmath13 requires a reference @xmath3 distribution in @xmath0 which is obtained from the analysis of a dedicated @xmath0 run at @xmath14  tev at the lhc in march 2011 , where alice collected about 70 m minimum bias events .",
