    "the per - nucleon structure function @xmath2 measured on a nucleus ( @xmath3 ) was first reported to be smaller than that measured on deuterium at intermediate @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) by european muon collaboration in 1983 @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon is now commonly referred to as the emc effect , which was completely unexpected before the experiment .",
    "the early expectation was that the per - nucleon lepton deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) cross sections of heavy nuclei would not differ much from that of deuteron , for the nuclear binding energies are subtle compared to the high energy lepton probes ( at gev energy scale and higher ) .",
    "anyway , the quark momentum distributions in bound nucleons embedded in nuclei are modified .",
    "a lot of theoretical efforts have been made aimed at understanding the underlying physics which alters the quark distributions inside nuclei .",
    "comprehensive reviews of the emc effect can be found in refs .",
    "however , there is no generally accepted model for the effect over all @xmath6 and @xmath4 .",
    "early experiment at slac showed that the emc effect was logarithmically related to atomic mass number @xmath6 , or proportional to the average nuclear density @xcite .",
    "however , recent measurement at jlab found that the assumption that the size of the emc effect scales with nuclear density breaks down for very light nuclei @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the effect scales with the local nuclear environment of the nucleons . since then",
    ", the nuclear dependence of quark distributions has become an important subject to explore the origin of the emc effect .",
    "detailed analysis of the nuclear dependence of the emc effect and short - range correlations ( src ) is presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , aimed at testing the possible explanations for the correlation between the emc effect and src @xcite .",
    "it is suggested that the local density explanation @xcite is slightly better than the explanation in terms of high virtuality @xcite by comparing the fits to emc slopes versus @xmath7 and the fits to emc slopes versus @xmath8 .",
    "the src scaling factor @xmath9 is defined as the ratio of per - nucleon inclusive electron scattering cross section on nucleus a to that on deuteron at @xmath10 ( gev@xmath11 ) and @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "@xmath13 is similar to @xmath7 but with the correction for c.m .",
    "motion of the correlated pair , which better represents the relative probability of a nucleon being part of a short - range correlation pair @xcite .",
    "the explanation for the emc - src correlation is still not clear .",
    "as we know , protons and neutrons inside nuclei are bound together with nuclear force . in quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) theory level",
    ", the powerful attractive nuclear force comes from the residual strong interaction of quarks , which resembles the van der waals force between molecules .",
    "the emergence of nuclear force from qcd theory is a complex phenomenon and depends on the distances being considered .",
    "nonetheless , calculations of interactions among nucleons are starting to be realized from lattice qcd @xcite .",
    "the nuclear medium modifies the quark distributions of a nucleon .",
    "a related fundamental question is wether the nuclear force plays an important role in the emc effect .",
    "role of nuclear binding in the emc effect is an important and old issue @xcite .",
    "usually , the contribution of nuclear binding is believed to be small in the convolution picture @xcite .",
    "the emc effect can not be explained by nuclear binding and nucleon fermi motion alone . nevertheless , with new correction to the convolution formula , some @xcite argue that the nuclear binding effects may be sufficient to explain the emc effect at intermediate @xmath4 .",
    "recent phenomenological study of the nuclear structure function perfectly describes the emc slopes and detailed shapes of the emc effect with a few parameters @xcite . in the model ,",
    "a number of different nuclear effects including nuclear shadowing , fermi motion and binding , nuclear pion excess and off - shell correction to bound nucleon structure functions are considered . the off - shell correction is quantified by the average nucleon separation energy .",
    "interestingly , model calculations including off - shell effect are in agreement with the structure functions for light nuclei @xcite .    instead of studying the contribution of nuclear binding to the emc effect",
    ", we try to find out the relation between nuclear force and the emc effect . in this work ,",
    "we define nuclear residual strong interaction energy ( rsie ) as the energy ( mass ) loss of nucleons binding together with nucleon - nucleon strong interaction ( see sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] ) .",
    "the linear correlation between rsie and the emc effect is shown in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we investigate the correlations between rsie and other quantities which are connected to the emc effect . finally , a summary is given in sec .",
    "the simplest description of strength of nuclear force is the nuclear binding energy .",
    "the nuclear binding energy , defined as @xmath14 , is one of the well known static properties of the nuclei . in experiment ,",
    "the nuclear binding energy is precisely measured for most of the nuclei @xcite . while it is known in theory that nuclear binding results from the dominated strong interaction , it is difficult to calculate .",
    "a simple estimation of the nuclear binding energy can be calculated by the semi - empirical bethe - weizscker ( bw ) mass formula @xcite . according to bw formula",
    ", the binding energy of a nucleus of atomic mass number @xmath6 and proton number @xmath15 is described as @xmath16 where @xmath17 mev , @xmath18 mev , @xmath19 mev , and @xmath20 mev .",
    "the pairing energy @xmath21 for even @xmath22-even @xmath15 , @xmath23 for odd @xmath22-odd @xmath15 , and @xmath24 for odd a nuclei , with @xmath25 mev .",
    "similar to nuclear binding energy , we define rsie ( abbreviation of residual strong interaction energy ) as the energy loss due to the nucleon - nucleon strong interaction . the definition is given to quantitatively describe the strength of strong interaction part between nucleons .",
    "assuming the nuclear binding comes from only electro - magnetic and strong interaction , rsie can be extracted from binding energy after coulomb contribution @xmath26 removed .",
    "hence , we get @xmath27 the charged protons inside a nucleus repel each other resulting in coulomb repulsive energy",
    ". the coulomb energy is evaluated by taken the nucleus as a liquid spherical charged drop and with self - coulomb energy of @xmath15 protons removed , which is a good approximation for heavy nuclei .",
    "the very light nuclei may not exist as a spherical charged drop , yet @xmath28 is still a simple estimation .",
    "although bw mass formula is of excellent accuracy for heavy nuclei , it fails in describing very light nuclei and nuclei with magic number .",
    "therefore we take the measured binding energies @xmath29 from experiments in this analysis instead of the calculations from bw formula . besides , the measured binding energies are precise and model independent .",

    "the binding energy varies with the isotope . in the emc effect experiments , some of the target elements have more than one stable isotope . for the cases of cu and ag , two stable isotopes",
    "both have big natural abundances ( see table [ table1 ] ) .",
    "the natural abundances are taken from ref .",

    "the off - shell correction to the bound nucleon quantified by the nucleon separation energy describes well the emc effect of both heavy and light nuclei .",

    "the average nucleon separation energy @xcite as a function of the per - nucleon rsie is shown in fig .",
    ". roughly , rsie per nucleon and the average nucleon separation energy are linearly correlated .",
    "in fact , these two quantities are both related to the nuclear force . compared to the average separation energy ,",
    "the rsie describes only the strong interaction part of the nuclear force .",
    "in addition , rsie is easy to calculate .",
    "it is reasonable to investigate the relationship between rsie and nucleon - nucleon ( nn ) src , as there is strong connection found between src and the emc effect .",
    "the strength of nn src is usually described by @xmath7 or @xmath13 .",
