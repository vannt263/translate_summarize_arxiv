    "in the past few years , high angular resolution observations of protoplanetary disks have revolutionized our understanding of planet formation .",
    "rich structures have been identified in disk images in near infrared ( nir ) and in mm / cm dust continuum and gas emission . among them , a particularly intriguing class of features is narrow gaps , found in systems such as tw hya @xcite , hd 169142 @xcite , hd 97048 @xcite , ab aur @xcite , v 4046 sgr @xcite , hd 141569 @xcite , rx j1615.3 - 3255 @xcite , and hl tau @xcite .",
    "these gaps have both their inner and outer edges revealed in images , enabling a full view of the gap structure and particularly , a measurement of the gap width .",

    "* ) , may be common gaps opened by multiple planets @xcite , the above mentioned narrow gaps are more likely to be the products of single planets .    the masses and locations of planets still forming in disks are key quantities in the study of planet formation .",
    "different formation scenarios , such as `` core accretion '' and `` gravitational instability '' models , predict planets to form at different locations , with different final masses . measuring the masses of gap - opening planets ( @xmath2 ) will thus help us distinguish different planet formation scenarios . to do this ,",
    "quantitative connections between @xmath2 and gap properties that are directly measurable from images must be established . at the moment ,",
    "a general scheme for this purpose is lacking .",
    "@xcite pioneered in this direction by connecting @xmath2 with gap width at both infrared and millimeter ( mm ) wavelengths .",
    "they explored a limited parameter space ( e.g. , no variation on disk viscosity ) , and it is unclear whether synthetic observations based on 2d hydro simulations employed by @xcite generate the same results as 3d hydro simulations .    in this work",
    ", we propose to advance this field by connecting @xmath2 with gap properties in nir scattered light .",
    "our goal is to establish direct and quantitative relations between two observables  the gap depth ( @xmath6 ; the contrast ) and width ( @xmath7 ; the radial extent )  with @xmath2 , and two disk parameters , the aspect ratio @xmath8 and @xmath3-viscosity @xcite .",
    "this effort is newly motivated by recent advances in nir polarized scattered light imaging driven by subaru / hiciao @xcite , gemini / gpi @xcite , vlt / naco @xcite and sphere@xcite . at the moment",
    "these high resolution imaging instruments are discovering gaps at an ever faster pace , which urgently necessitates the effort presented here .",
    "this @xmath9-[{m_{\\rm p}},h / r,\\alpha]$ ] connection can be segmented into two parts ,    1 .",
    "@xmath9-[{\\delta_\\sigma},{w_\\sigma}]$ ] : connect gap depth and width in images to the _ physical _ gap depth and width in the gas distribution , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , measured from the disk surface density @xmath12 ; 2 .",

    "analytically , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* see also @xcite ) have shown that based on torque balancing one can derive a simple scaling relation @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the depleted and initial ( undepleted ) surface density in the gap , and @xmath17 . for the gap width ,",
    "@xcite calculated the propagation of planet - induced density waves , and showed that in the weakly - nonlinear regime the gap width , the waves dissipate and deposit angular momentum over the length scale `` shocking length '' , which is proportional to the disk scale height .",
    "it is therefore likely that the width of the gap will also be proportional to the scale height : @xmath18 where @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the radius of the outer and inner gap edges , respectively .",
    "this relation will be tested and confirmed with our models .",
    "the weakly - nonlinear regime applies to planets with masses comparable or smaller than the thermal mass @xmath21 , @xmath22    several groups have carried out numerical simulations to fit @xmath10 and @xmath11 as power laws of @xmath2 , @xmath8 , and @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "these empirical correlations were synthesized from 2d hydro simulations , and @xcite confirmed that gap opening in 3d produces the same gap profiles as in 2d .",
    "the exact functional forms vary somewhat in the literature , mostly due to variations in the definitions of @xmath11 and @xmath10 . for the gap depth",
    ", @xcite found , for deep gaps with @xmath10 exceeding 10 , up to @xmath23 , equation  [ eq : gapdepthsigma ] agrees with simulations to within a factor of 2 . for the gap width ,",
    "hydro simulations by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite have verified the results of @xcite , and showed that gap opening indeed initially occurs at a fixed number of scale heights away from the planet s orbit for a given planet mass . by defining the gap width as the radial distance between the two edges where the surface density drops to 50% of the initial value , @xcite found @xmath24 , which not only has dependencies on @xmath2 and @xmath3 , but also predicts an inverse relation with @xmath8 . whether these differences reflect",
    "some unknown physics of of gap opening , or simply due to the different definitions of @xmath11 , is unclear .",
    "the first step , finding out how a density gap looks like in scattered light images , is the aim of this paper .",
    "we address this question by carrying out 2d and 3d hydro and 3d radiative transfer simulations to study synthetic images of planet - opened gaps with parametrized @xmath8 and @xmath3 .",
    "this step is affected by properties of the disk and observational conditions , in particular , the angular resolution @xmath25 ( a known parameter for a specific observation ) and the inclination of the system @xmath26 .",
    "the dependence @xmath26 can be eliminated by only measuring the scattered light radial profile at @xmath27 scattering angle ( section  [ sec : inclinations ] ) , such as in face - on disks and along the major axis of inclined disks .",
    "a few other factors , including the total disk mass @xmath28 , wavelength @xmath29 , and grain properties , may affect the conversion as well ; however , within reasonable ranges in the parameter space assumed in this paper ( optically thick , gravitationally stable disks ; @xmath30 ; close to @xmath31 scattering angle ) they are generally unimportant ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for extremely faint gaps in which the gap bottom reaches the noise level in images , the sensitivity of the observations ( i.e. , detection limit ) will affect the measurement of @xmath6 ; in this work we focus on relatively low mass planets and shallow gaps and do not consider such situation .",
    "we focus on narrow gaps ( @xmath32 ) opened by a single relatively low mass giant planet about neptune ( @xmath33 ) and saturn ( @xmath34 ) mass , up to one jupiter ( @xmath5 ) mass .",
    "the motivation is mainly threefold .",
    "first , such planets are probably more common than their more massive siblings @xcite , and therefore it may be more likely to see gaps opened by such planets .",
    "@xcite concluded that only @xmath35 of @xmath36 @xmath37 stars have @xmath38 @xmath5 planets at orbital distances of @xmath39 au .",
    "although little is known about the statistics of sub - jovian planet at tens of au , observations such as hl tau hints at their existence @xcite .",
    "second , massive planets ( @xmath40 ) may open eccentric gaps ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and vortices may form at the gap edge excited by the rossby wave instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "these features complicate the interpretation of gaps in observations .",
    "third , wide gaps may be common gaps opened by multiple planets , in which case there is a degeneracy between the number of planets and their masses @xcite , preventing unique solutions on planets masses .",
    "the lower limit of @xmath2 in our work is set so that its gap may be visible in scattered light ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "in this section , we briefly introduce the numerical methods employed to produce synthetic images of gaps . in short ,",
    "we use the hydrodynamics code ` penguin ` @xcite to calculate the density structures of planet - opened gaps in 2d and 3d , then `` translate '' the resulting density structures to scattered light images using radiative transfer simulations by the monte carlo @xcite code . for hydro simulations we follow the procedures described in @xcite , while for radiative transfer simulations we adopt the methods in @xcite .",
    "below we briefly summarize the key processes .",
    "the 2d simulations performed in this paper have an identical setup as the one used in @xcite , and the 3d one is identical to @xcite .",
    "the only differences are that we choose the parameters @xmath41 , @xmath8 , and @xmath3 from a different parameter space , focusing more on smaller planets and lower disk viscosities , and that all results here are obtained after 6000 orbits , equivalent to about 1 myr at 30 au around a solar - mass star .",
    "this time is sufficient for models with @xmath42 to reach a quasi - steady state . for the models with the lowest @xmath3 values ,",
    "the gaps have not yet fully settled , but they are still relevant models since 1 myr is already a significant fraction of the typical protoplanetary disk lifetime .",
    "we recapitulate some important features here , and refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite for the details .",
    "the initial disk profile assumes the following surface density and sound speed profiles : @xmath43 @xmath44 where we set @xmath45 , , and @xmath46 is a parameter we vary to obtain different @xmath8 values . since the disk scale height @xmath0 is @xmath47 with @xmath48 being the keperlian frequency , @xmath8 is constant in radius . in 3d hydrostatic equilibrium ,",
    "the initial density structure is : @xmath49\\right ) \\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath50 , with @xmath51 being the scale height at @xmath52 , is the initial gas density at the location of the planet .",
    "density and sound speed are related by a locally isothermal equation of state .",
    "the kinematic viscosity in the disk is @xmath53 , where @xmath3 is constant in radius .",
    "the simulation grid spans @xmath54 to @xmath55 in radius , which corresponds to 12 au to 60 au , if the planet is placed at 30 au .",
    "table  [ tab : models ] lists the parameters and results for all models .      for radiative transfer calculations ,",
    "we assume a central source of 2.325 @xmath56 and 4350 k , appropriate for a 1 @xmath37 star at 1 myr @xcite . for 3d hydro simulations , we directly feed the density grid into radiative transfer simulations ; for 2d hydro simulations , we puff up the disk surface density in the vertical direction @xmath57 by a gaussian profile , @xmath58 using the same scale height @xmath0 as in the hydro simulations .",
    "the mcrt simulation domain spans @xmath59 from the disk midplane , which is about a factor of 2 higher than the scattered light surface . a 1 au radius circumplanetary region centered on the planet",
    "is excised ( except in section  [ sec:2d3d ] and figure  [ fig:2d3d ] , see below ) , for reasons laid out in section  [ sec:2d3d ] .",
    "the hydro simulations are gas only , while scattered light comes from the dust .",
    "we convert gas into dust by assuming the two are well mixed , and assume interstellar medium grains @xcite for our dust model .",
    "these grains are sub-@xmath60 in size , and their scattering properties are calculated using mie theory .",
    "they are small enough that their stopping time is very short compared to their orbital timescale and vertical stirring timescale ( characterized by the viscous parameter @xmath3 ) in our simulations , so they are dynamically well coupled with gas ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we scale the size of the hydro grid so that the planet is at 30 au . given the inner working angles ( iwa ) in current gpi and sphere observations ( @xmath61au at 140 pc ) , 30 au is about as close as a planet can be for the inner gap edge to still be outside the iwa .",
    "the inner dust disk edge is taken to be dust sublimation radius @xmath62 , where dust reaches temperature of 1600 k ; between @xmath62 and the inner boundary of hydro simulations ( 12 au ) , we assume an axisymmetric inner disk smoothly joining the outer hydro disk with a constant surface density . the details of the inner disk does not matter as long as it is axisymmetric and does not cast significant shadows on the other disk .",
    "we scale the hydro disk so that the initial condition @xmath63 g @xmath64 , resulting in a final total dust disk mass between @xmath65 to @xmath66 inside 60 au ( depending on how deep the gap is ) .",
    "we note that gap width and contrast do not depend on the assumed disk mass within one order of magnitude from the chosen value .",
    "radiative transfer simulations produce full resolution polarized intensity ( pi ) images at @xmath67-band , which are convolved by a gaussian point spread function to achieve a desired angular resolutions .",
    "fiducially we choose @xmath68 , comparable to what is achievable by sphere and gpi , unless otherwise noted .    as examples ,",
    "figure  [ fig : example ] shows the dust surface density and scattered light images at both face on and @xmath69 inclination for model 1@xmath705@xmath31e-3 . unless otherwise noted , all images in this paper show @xmath67-band polarized intensity @xmath71 , although we note that our results generally apply to total intensity images as well ( see below ) . in panel",
    "( e ) and ( f ) , we scale the images by @xmath72 to compensate for the distance from the star , where @xmath73 is the distance from the star ( deprojected in inclined cases ) .",
    "unless otherwise noted , all @xmath67-band images and their radial profiles below have been scaled by @xmath72 .",
    "@xcite have shown that the surface density of planet - opened gaps in 3d hydro simulations are nearly the same as gaps in 2d simulations . in this section",
    "we show that synthetic images are also practically identical between a 3d model and a model with 2d surface density manually puffed up using equation  [ eq : gauss ] .",
    "figure  [ fig:2d3d ] shows two face - on synthetic images and their azimuthally averaged radial profile for the model 1@xmath705@xmath31e-3 .",
    "panel ( a ) is from a 3d hydro simulation , while panel ( b ) is produced by puffing up the surface density of the model by the same assumed @xmath8 profile as in the 3d hydro calculation .",
    "note that unlike all other images in the paper , in both panels the circumplanetary region is not excised .",
    "the gap profiles ( c ) from the two images are essentially identical .",
    "this result means vertical kinematic support is unimportant in the vertical distribution of material in the gap region , and we can safely puff up 2d hydro surface density structures in mcrt simulations to study gaps in scattered light .",
    "the differences between the two images are in the local structures .",
    "first , the spiral arms are clearly more prominent in ( a ) than in ( b ) , due to vertical kinematic support in planet - induced density waves ( * ? ? ?",
    "* dong & fung , submitted ) .",
    "second , the circumplanetary region sticks out in ( b ) while it is not noticeable in ( a ) .",
    "this is because when puffing up 2d structures into 3d , the circumplanetary region , which has a higher surface density than the surroundings , is artificially expanded in the vertical direction by the same @xmath8 as the rest of the disk . in reality",
    "though the gravity in the circumplanetary region is dominated by the planet so the actual @xmath8 of the circumplanetary region is much smaller .",
    "this leads to artificially brightening of the region in scattered light in ( b ) .",
    "for this reason , and to avoid the artificial shadow in the outer disk produced by this structure ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we excise the circumplanetary region in 2d surface density maps when puffing it up in mcrt simulations in the rest of the paper .",
    "in this section , we explore the connections between gap properties in surface density to disk and planet parameters @xmath8 , @xmath3 , and @xmath2 , and the correlations between gaps in scattered light and gaps in surface density .",
    "figure  [ fig : sigma_image_rp ] shows the radial profiles of the surface density , and both full resolution and convolved images at face - on viewing angle for three representative models with @xmath4 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "the images have been scaled by @xmath72 .",
    "qualitatively , in all three cases , each with very different gap depths , the radial profiles of the full resolution images closely traces the variations in the surface density profiles .",
    "this general behavior has been found by @xcite using analytical calculations of scattered light grazing angles in disks with narrow gaps .",
    "the two deviate near the gap bottom , where the scattered light profile does not reach as deep as the surface density .",
    "also , the outer edge of the scattered light gap lies slightly inside the surface density gap .",
    "these observations can be qualitatively explained . approximately , scattered light comes from a surface with optical depth of unity to the star @xcite . for disks with constant @xmath8 ,",
    "if the surface density variation is smooth , this surface is flat at roughly a constant polar angle @xmath78 ( i.e. , not concave - up as in flared disks ) . in this case , at @xmath79 the @xmath72-scaled intensity of the scattered light at each radius is roughly proportional to the surface density of the dust above the surface , @xmath80 . because @xmath81 for disks with constant @xmath8 , it follows that @xmath82 , which is what we find",
    "this relation breaks when the surface density fluctuation is so large that the disk surface is no longer at roughly a constant @xmath83 , which happens when the gap depletion is high , and at the gap edges .",
    "also , this analysis does not formally hold if the disk surface is flared ( i.e. , @xmath8 increases outward ) .",
    "however , gaps are local structures , and the global flareness of the disk may not significantly affect the width and depth of local structures .",
    "we will come back to this point later in section  [ sec : flareness ] .    convolving the full resolution image by a finite psf smooths structures .",
    "convolved images ( dotted line ) thus closely follow full resolution images outside the gap , as the variations occur on spatial scale much larger than the angular resolution ( @xmath84au for @xmath68 and @xmath85140 pc ) . inside the gaps , convolved images have less steep edges and shallower depths .",
    "a planet - opened gap is a perturbation on top of an initial `` background '' disk with no planets .",
    "the definition and characterization of a gap are relative to this background . while in simulations",
    "a planetless background can be well defined , in real observations of actual systems it is nearly impossible to do so .",
    "in addition , a complete global disk profile is often not accessible in real observations with finite inner and outer working angles .",
    "in fact , based on scattered light alone it is usually difficult to verdict whether a `` gap - like '' structure is indeed a planet - opened gap or not . to mimic actual observations and to maximize the applicability of the correlations derived in this work , below we will assume gaps as local structures so that its parametrization only involves its immediate neighborhood , and we will characterize an observed gap in such a way that does not require prior knowledge of the underlying planetless background disk .",
    "we emphasize this is an necessary assumption in order to construct useful empirical relations to quickly and quantitatively convert observed gap properties to planet and disk properties . for individual actual systems , whether this assumption is good or not may be indicated by the reasonableness of the fitting .",
    "more accurate assessments of the planet and disk properties require detailed modeling of individual systems with specifically designed simulations to match the 1d ( or even 2d ) gap profiles , instead of using parameterized gap depth and width .",
    "the definitions of gap depth and width in surface density vary somewhat in the literature . for the former ,",
    "the common practice is to define it as the ratio between the minimum @xmath12 inside the gap ( or averaged over a finite radial range ) to a fiducial `` undepleted '' value ( @xmath16 ) .",
    "what counts as @xmath16 varies . for the gap width",
    ", the difficulty lies in defining the two gap edges , @xmath19 and @xmath20 ( such that @xmath86 ) .",
    "the common practice is to define them as where @xmath12 reaches a certain threshold fraction of @xmath16 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this class of width definitions does not work for shallow gaps in which the depletion is less than the threshold fraction . with this fixed - depth - width definition ,",
    "@xmath11 depends on @xmath2 and @xmath3 in addition to @xmath8 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this paper ,",
    "we adopt dynamical definitions of the gap depth and width in both surface density and images , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : definition ] .",
    "our definitions work for of gaps with a wide range of depth and width . for @xmath12 , we first find the location in the gap where @xmath12 reaches the minimum , @xmath87 . the initial value of @xmath12 at @xmath87 , @xmath88 , is regarded as the fiducial undepleted value .",
    "thus @xmath10 is defined as @xmath89 we then regard the inner and outer gap edges , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , as where surface density reaches the geometric mean of the minimum and the undepleted value , @xmath92 therefore the gap width @xmath11 is @xmath93 and the normalized gap width @xmath94 is defined as @xmath95 we note @xmath11 has a physical unit ( e.g. , au or arcsec ) , while @xmath94 is dimensionless .",
    "the definitions of gap width and gaps in scattered light are similar .",
    "we first scale the image by @xmath72 , then find the location in the gap where @xmath71 reaches the minimum , @xmath96 ( a gap can not be defined if the @xmath72-scaled intensity monotonically varies with radius ) .",
    "we find that in general @xmath97 , with small model - by - model differences .",
    "we then read the intensity at @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these two locations are far away from the gap region so they are considered to be outside the influence of the gap .",
    "a fiducial `` background '' @xmath100 at @xmath101 is subsequently defined as the geometric mean of the two points ( note that this choice assumes the underlying `` planetless '' background profile follows a power law ) , @xmath102 , and the gap depth is @xmath103 the inner and outer edges of the gap , @xmath104 and @xmath104 , are found at where @xmath71 reaches the geometric mean of @xmath100 and @xmath71 at @xmath96 .",
    "@xmath105 correspondingly , the width of the gap @xmath7 is defined as @xmath106 and the normalized gap width @xmath107 is @xmath108 the gap parameters in surface density and in face - on images for all models are listed in table  [ tab : models ] .    finally , we note that all image - related quantities , such as @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath107 , are functions of both angular resolution @xmath25 , and inclination @xmath26 , i.e. , @xmath109 , @xmath110 , and @xmath111 .",
    "we omit the variables when the context is clear .",
    "previous numerical studies have fit empirical relations to express @xmath11 and @xmath10 as functions of @xmath112 $ ] . here",
    "we derive our version based on the new definitions of depth and width in figure  [ fig : definition ] . as discussed in section  [ sec : intro ] , analytical weakly - nonlinear theory and simple scaling relations based on torque balancing have motivated equations  [ eq : gapdepthsigma ] and [ eq : width - h ] as possible functional forms for @xmath11 and @xmath10 .",
    "we are able to achieve good fit for both correlations , as shown in figure  [ fig : width_depth_sigma ] , by varying only the constant proportionality factor .",
    "for gap width we have @xmath114 the standard deviation @xmath115 is @xmath116 for all models .",
    "if we restrict to only the models that have been run for longer than viscous timescale ( @xmath4 and @xmath117 , the black points ) , we again recover eqn  ( [ eq : width - sigma - h ] ) while @xmath115 shrinks to @xmath118 .",
    "we note that if we adopt the @xcite definition of the gap width , we do recover their @xmath119 correlation ( with a standard deviation of 17% ) .",
    "however we prefer our dynamical definition of the gap width over defining the width as the distance between two points on the edges with a fixed depletion factor for a few reasons .",
    "first , the latter does not work for shallow gaps opened by relatively low mass planets , and in real observations such gaps are more common than deeper gaps opened by more massive planets , due to the higher occurrence rate of smaller planets than their more massive siblings @xcite .",
    "second , adopting the latter definition returns a less robust correlation between the gap width in images and the gap width in surface density ( not shown ) .",
    "third , while the @xcite correlation is a pure empirical correlation synthesized from simulations within a confined parameter space , our eqn ( [ eq : width - sigma - h ] ) has some theoretical footing from gap opening theory , thus more robust when applying to real systems that may lie outside the parameter space explored by our models .    for gap depth",
    ", we have @xmath120 with @xmath121 for all but the three @xmath122 and @xmath74 models , which have the largest thermal masses in our models , @xmath123 , and so their gap opening process is in the strongly nonlinear regime and the analytical torque balancing calculations break .",
    "we have experimented with freeing the power law indexes in the fit ; overall no significant improvement is found .",
    "we thus conclude that the gap width and depth definitions in figure  [ fig : definition ] successfully capture the physics of gap opening as argued by analytical theories .",
    "one thing to note is that @xmath8 can now be directly constrained based on measured gap properties . assuming hydrostatic equilibrium in the vertical direction , scale height @xmath8 is related to disk temperature @xmath124 at each radius as @xmath125 where @xmath126 is the keplerian speed , and @xmath127 is the mean molecular weight .",
    "thus , our constraints on @xmath8 based on measured gap properties can be used to infer the midplane temperature of the disk at the location of the gap .      at @xmath79",
    ", we measure 4 quantities for each model for a given @xmath25 : @xmath94 , @xmath10 , @xmath128 , and @xmath129 .",
    "figure  [ fig : width_depth ] compares @xmath94 with @xmath128 , and @xmath10 with @xmath129 , for both @xmath130 and @xmath68 .    in full resolution images",
    ", it is well approximated that @xmath131 , with a standard deviation of 7% for all gaps .",
    "for the depth , @xmath132 is close to @xmath10 for shallow gaps ( @xmath133 ) , but deviates from @xmath10 for deeper gaps .",
    "once convolved , we expect the gap to become shallower and narrower , and we expect the effect of psf smearing to depend on the ratio of @xmath134 since with higher angular resolution ( smaller @xmath25 ) and/or wider gaps ( bigger @xmath7 ) , the intrinsic gap profile at @xmath130 is better preserved ; and vice versa .",
    "this is confirmed in the figure  for wider gaps @xmath128 well correlates with @xmath94 ( as well as @xmath135 ) , while narrower gaps becomes noticeably wider with finite @xmath25 . for the depth",
    ", psf smearing makes the gap shallower in all cases .",
    "quantitatively , we find @xmath128 is correlated to @xmath136 , @xmath137 , and @xmath6 in the following way , @xmath138 with @xmath139% . in the high angular resolution limit ( @xmath140 ) , @xmath141 . for the gap depth , we find @xmath142 with @xmath143% . in the high angular resolution ( @xmath140 ) and shallow gap limit ( @xmath144 ) , @xmath145 .",
    "both equations are invertible and it is straight forward to obtain @xmath10 and @xmath11 , given @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath25 .",
    "these correlations are synthesized for the parameter space of @xmath146 and @xmath147 ; we caution their applications to the parameter space beyond .      in this section ,",
    "we compare the radial profile of face - on images to the radial profile along the major axis of disks at modest inclinations ( @xmath148 ) . in the latter ,",

    "therefore , strictly speaking the major axis going through the star is not the major axis of the gap ellipse ( the two are parallel to each other ) .",

    "this choice results in a flat disk surface , which simplifies the problem in our qualitative analysis of the physical picture , and enables us to obtain a straightforward intuition to why scattered light features closely follow the structures in surface density ( section  [ sec : qualitative ] ) .",
    "however , real disks passively heated by the central star may be flared , with @xmath159 and @xmath160 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for example , by modeling the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) and resolved mm observations , @xcite obtained @xmath161 for a sample of 12 transitional disks .",
    "this surface flareness certainly affects the scattered light distribution in disks ; for example , flared disks have surface brightness decreasing slower with radius than flat disks .",
    "this may affect the width and depth of gaps in images , and alter the surface density profiles slightly ( through eqns  [ eq : depth - sigma ] and [ eq : width - sigma - h ] ) .",

    ", the @xmath8 variation across the gap under a reasonable @xmath162 ( e.g. , @xmath163 ) may be too small to produce any significant effect . to test this hypothesis",

    "specifically , for @xmath94 and @xmath107 , all three models return essentially the same values ; for @xmath10 , the two flared models have measurements higher than the flat model by @xmath167 ; and for @xmath168 , the two flared models differ from the flat model by about 10% . therefore , we tentatively conclude that under reasonable flareness ( @xmath163 ) , the flaring of the disk does not significantly affect the gap properties in both the density and image space for narrow gaps as in this example ; subsequently , we expect the correlations derived in this paper to hold to a good approximation .",

    "note that normally @xmath8 can be constrained directly from the gap width , and it leaves the quantity @xmath176 to be constrained from the gap depth .",
    "we note that these correlations are derived for polarized intensity at @xmath67-band , but they also apply to total intensity images , and/or images in other spectral bands within a factor of @xmath177 difference in wavelength from @xmath67-band ( as long as the signals are dust scattering dominated ) , because both depth and width are measured in a relative sense , and face - on radial profiles and major axis radial profiles in inclined images minimize the dependence on scattering angles . finally , we emphasize that a key precondition when applying these correlations to actual systems is that the gap bottom needs to be detected ( i.e. , the gap bottom in images should be above the detection threshold ) . if not , the gap depth becomes illy defined .",
    "in simulating the gap images and deriving the correlations , we have made a number of assumptions in disk structures and modeling . here",

    "the timescale that a planet takes to fully open a gap with a gap width of @xmath178 ( i.e. , our gap width ) is approximately the viscous timescale to cross @xmath178 , @xmath179 . with @xmath180 ,",
    "@xmath181 is longer than 3myr .",
    "therefore , in low viscosity disks , very young systems , and large separations from the center , gaps may not reach their final depth and width , which invalids the @xmath170-[{\\delta_\\sigma},{\\delta_\\sigma}]$ ] correlations synthesized in this work and in others .",
    "this gap opening timescale issue is however irrelevant to the @xmath182-[{\\delta_\\sigma},{w_\\sigma}]$ ] conversions , and we expect them to hold even when the gap is only partially opened .",
    "3 .   in our mcrt simulations",
    ", no noise is added into the images ( apart from the intrinsic poisson noise due to finite number of photons ) , thus the gap bottom reach their theoretically minimum .",
    "if in real observations the gap bottom reaches the noise level , the measured gap depth , and the derived planet mass , will be their lower limits , while the measured gap width , and the derived disk scale height , will be their upper limits .",
