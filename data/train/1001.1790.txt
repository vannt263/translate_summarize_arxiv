    "a globular cluster ( gc ) is a gravitationally bound system of stars with a spherical shape .",
    "the typical radius is of the order of 10 pc and its mass is about @xmath2 .",
    "stars in a gc are known to be very old and their chemical compositions roughly represent that of the primordial universe .    among known @xmath3 gcs , @xmath0 centauri is notorious for its unusual properties .",
    "its mass is about @xmath4  @xcite and it is the most massive gc in the milky way galaxy .",
    "one of the most astonishing facts about @xmath0 centauri is that its dwarf stars split into two sequences  @xcite , the blue main sequence ( bms ) and the red main sequence ( rms ) .",
    "25%-35% of the dwarf stars are populated by the bms  @xcite .",
    "although enhanced metallicities might split a main sequence by lowering the surface temperature of metal - rich stars , it is reported that stars in the bms are more metal - rich than those in the rms in @xmath0 centauri  @xcite .",
    "recently , it is reported that there also exists the third redder ms @xcite .",
    "this ms is suggested to be populated by super metal - rich stars @xcite and seems to have nothing to do with their helium contents .",
    "furthermore , observations by the hubble space telescope discovered the triple main sequence in another gc , ngc 2808  @xcite .",
    "ngc 2808 is also massive , with its mass above @xmath5  @xcite .",
    "it was found that , in either gcs , the isochrone that matches the properties of the bms can be produced by assuming very high helium abundances ( @xmath6 ) , @xmath7  @xcite . as other parameters",
    "do not have much effect on colors , it is very likely that the helium enrichment is the cause of the multiple main sequence .",
    "the origin of the enhanced helium abundances in the bms stars has been a mystery .",
    "it was suggested , for example , that the ejecta descended from massive asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars would enhance the helium abundances of the main sequence stars and split the main sequence  @xcite .",
    "however , it is difficult for massive agb stars to produce as much helium as @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "what is more , the amount of helium supplied from agb stars is not enough to increase the helium content of all stars in the bms up to @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "helium enhancement by massive stars is also suggested to explain the ms splitting @xcite .",
    "rotating low - metal massive stars can enhance the helium abundance in the stellar winds but such stars should accelerate the helium - rich matter by the subsequent supernova explosions",
    ". the helium rich ejecta might be too energetic to be trapped in a gc and could easily escape from it .",
    "these difficulties associated with the agb and massive star scenarios might be relieved if the gc was originally the nucleus of a more massive dwarf galaxy @xcite .",
    "there were much more agb stars in the dwarf galaxy and the helium supplied from these agb stars might be sufficient to produce the observed number of bms stars .",
    "as for the massive star scenario , a massive dwarf galaxy might be able to trap the helium - rich ejecta due to its deeper gravitational potential .",
    "however , there remain problems in both scenarios .",
    "it is still difficult to produce the observed fraction of bms stars with the helium - rich matter or these scenarios seem to require an initial mass function of stars extremely biased toward massive stars . in addition , no significant spread in metallicities of stars in ngc 2808 is incompatible with the observed spread in metallicities of stars in a dwarf galaxy .    most helium in the universe is believed to be produced by the big bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) . by observations of extragalactic metal poor h ii regions",
    "@xcite , the mass fraction of helium produced during bbn ( @xmath10 ) is estimated to be @xmath11 .",
    "one of the parameters that affect @xmath10 is the baryon - to - photon ratio ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "recently , results of the five - year observation of the cosmic microwave background radiation ( cmbr ) by the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap ) were released  @xcite .",
    "the baryon density parameter is determined to be @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the normalized hubble constant given by dividing the hubble constant by @xmath15 @xmath16 .",
    "combining this value with the well - known temperature of cmbr , @xmath17 k  @xcite , @xmath12 is determined to be @xmath18 . given this @xmath12 , the calculation of the standard bbn yields @xmath19 , matching well with the observed values  @xcite .",
    "in the standard bbn theory , however , it is assumed that the bbn occurred homogeneously and @xmath12 has a uniform value .",
    "although wmap did not detect the inhomogeneity of the universe with scales smaller than a resolution @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , there remains a possibility of inhomogeneity with scales under @xmath22 mpc . within regions",
    "smaller than 10 mpc , @xmath12 might not take the standard value .",
    "many calculations have been done with various values of @xmath12 ( see the references of  @xcite ) .",
    "the general results are that the higher @xmath12 becomes , the more abundant helium will be .",
    "so , here comes a new candidate for the enigmatic mechanism of the helium enhancement in the bms , inhomogeneous bbn with a high value of @xmath12 .",
    "we consider a baryogenesis mechanism that enhances the baryon density in regions with the mass scale of @xmath23 , a comparable amount of baryons to the gcs that have multiple main sequence .",
    "though we do not specify this baryogenesis in more detail , the affleck - dine mechanism @xcite can realize this situation right after the inflation era .",
    "this mechanism can enhance the baryon density as high as @xmath24 in a region with the mass scale of @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "the size of inhomogeneity is a free parameter in this mechanism .",
    "the mass scale and desired @xmath12 indicate that the scale of necessary inhomogeneities is much smaller than the scales of fluctuations in the cmbr that can be detected by wmap .",
    "recent papers by matsuura et al .",
    "@xcite have preformed calculations of the bbn with high values of @xmath12 on the basis of the affleck - dine baryogenesis .",
    "such an inhomogeneous bbn may be affected by the diffusion of neutrons .",
    "lara @xcite showed that regions with enhanced @xmath12 s do not lead to abundances of light elements significantly deviated from those of the ambient medium if their size at the temperature of 100 gk was smaller than @xmath25 cm .",
    "since the size of the region we are concerned with in this paper is of the order of @xmath26 cm at this temperature ( see eq .",
    "( [ size ] ) ) and much larger than @xmath25 cm , the diffusion of neutrons can not change the yields of the bbn",
    ". still larger @xmath12 s in our scenario suppress the diffusion of neutrons further .",
    "in addition , this region extending over the event horizon even at the end of the bbn tolerates the diffusion of neutrons .    in this paper",
    ", we seek a possibility that the over abundance of helium in the bms of gcs is due to the inhomogeneous bbn caused by the baryogenesis .",
    "first of all , we determine the parameter region that reproduces the helium abundance of bms stars .",
    "the parameters we concerns are the baryon - to - photon ratio ( @xmath12 ) and the degeneracy of electron neutrinos ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "@xmath27 is defined as @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the chemical potential of electron neutrinos and @xmath30 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "these parameters are the most effective in the sense that they can change the abundances of elements synthesized by the bbn . in section",
    "ii , we briefly summarize effects of the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath27 during the bbn .",
    "we also summarize calculations we have done in section ii .",
    "results are given in section iii and the evolution of the helium enhanced region is discussed in section iv .",
    "the conclusion is given in section v.",
    "the bbn occurred when the temperature of the universe was about @xmath31 k. the parameters that govern the abundance of helium synthesized during bbn are @xmath12 and @xmath27 for a given set of the cosmological parameters .",
    "as @xmath12 represents the density of baryons , collisions of baryons occur more frequently with increasing @xmath12 , resulting in larger @xmath10 .",
    "the parameter @xmath27 represents lepton asymmetry and it can affect @xmath10 directly through the reactions @xmath32 which determines the number of neutrons and protons before bbn . at the equilibrium of these reactions , the number ratio of neutrons to protons is expressed by a function of the temperature @xmath33 and @xmath27 as @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the difference of the rest energies between a proton and a neutron . as most of neutrons that had existed before the bbn era were brought into helium nuclei , a negative",
    "@xmath27 enhances helium synthesis .",
    "we treat @xmath27 as a free parameter restricted from observations  @xcite and assume @xmath36-equilibrium at the beginning of calculations . allowed range with 2@xmath37 cl is @xmath38 note that the affleck - dine mechanism prefers negative @xmath27 with the absolute value of the order of @xmath12 because @xmath12 is supposed to be positive @xcite .",
    "because the horizon scale right after the bbn is much smaller than @xmath1 in mass , the effect of diffusion is negligible .",
    "thus , we calculate the bbn with high @xmath12 in the same way as the homogeneous bbn ignoring inhomogeneities inside the region and adopt the same method of numerical calculations as that of the ordinary homogeneous bbn .",
    "we first calculated bbn with the reaction network including 61 nuclei shown in table .",
    "[ small ] .",
    "the nucleosynthesis with a larger reaction network with nuclei in table .",
    "[ large ] is also calculated to see how much heavy elements are produced .",
    "heavy element production during bbn with high @xmath12 is discussed in @xcite . to calculate bbn",
    ", we used the kawano code introduced in  @xcite , with revised reaction rates taking from  @xcite whenever they are available .",
    "reaction rates of heavy elements are taken from  @xcite .",
    ".nuclei included in the small reaction network .",

    "n refers to neutron . [",
    "cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we calculate the bbn with various parameters .",
    "the calculations are started from the time when the temperature is @xmath41 k and we obtained the abundances at @xmath42 k. the nuclear statistical equilibrium and the @xmath36-equilibrium are assumed at the initial state .      to locate a star on the bms in @xmath0 centauri by enhancing the helium content",
    ", the helium fraction should be as high as 0.35 @xcite .",
    "therefore we require @xmath12 to be greater than @xmath43 that reproduces @xmath44 . to estimate the amount of helium produced during bbn , only the reactions of light elements are essential .",
    "for this reason , we use the small reaction network to estimate @xmath45 .",
    "the results of calculations are shown in fig .",
    "we performed the calculation with three different @xmath27 ; @xmath46 , @xmath47 , and @xmath48 .",
    "the horizontal line indicates @xmath49 . for @xmath46 ,",
    "@xmath12 yielding @xmath50 is in the region @xmath51 thus @xmath52 . for @xmath53 and @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "@xmath12 above these values are required to explain the bms stars .     for some sets of @xmath12 and @xmath27 .",
    "the horizontal line at the middle represents @xmath49.,width=340,height=302 ]      as previously predicted by matsuura et al .",
    "@xcite , heavy elements are produced during bbn with high @xmath12 . the amount of heavy elements produced during bbn gives the upper limit of @xmath12 .",
    "too large @xmath12 might overproduce heavy elements incompatible with the metallicity of bms , which is at least a factor of a few smaller than the solar abundances . as nuclei with the mass number ( @xmath40 ) of @xmath57 or greater",
    "are important for this restriction , we use a large reaction network for this purpose . for calculations of the large reaction network ,",
    "we only consider the case of @xmath46 .    in fig .",
    "[ 900 ] , we show the results of bbn calculations for some values of @xmath12 . between @xmath58 and @xmath59 ,",
    "there is a considerable jump in the amount of heavy elements with @xmath60 .",
    "fig . 7 of matsuura et al .",
    "@xcite shows that @xmath61 yields a significant amount of heavy elements with @xmath62 , comparable to the solar abundances . with higher @xmath12",
    ", the abundances of heavy elements continue to increase .",
    "observations show that the amounts of heavy elements are at least a factor of a few less than the solar abundances in the relevant gc @xcite .",
    "therefore the upper limit of @xmath12 is somewhere between @xmath63 and @xmath64 .    in fig .",
    "[ 900 ] , some elements @xmath60 are very close to the expected abundances of the gc stars . thus , it is a good touchstone of our model to check the abundances of the elements @xmath60 in the dwarfs in bms .",
    "even if a primordial gas with high @xmath10 was once formed at the time of bbn , it might be mixed with other gases in the outer regions and end up with a lower fraction of helium .",
    "we briefly show that the effect of such mixing would not affect the region with high helium abundance . here",
    ", we do not only consider effects of diffusion and accretion , but also take into account self - gravity as a competing process .",
    "helium ions in the region with a higher @xmath10 might diffuse outward the surrounding region with lower helium contents .",
    "this effect takes place after the horizon scale exceeds the size of the region , that is , after the temperature becomes lower than @xmath65 k. the diffusion equation for helium is written as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number density of helium and @xmath68 is the diffusion coefficient of helium with electrons and its magnitude is estimated as @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the mean free path of helium ions and @xmath71 is the thermal speed of helium ions . here",
    "the constant @xmath72 denotes the mass of hydrogen .",
    "the time scale @xmath73 of the diffusion is approximated as @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the size of the region .      before the recombination of electrons , photons and",
    "matters had been coupled and had the same temperature .",
    "the number density of helium during this epoch is proportional to the cube of the temperature and written as @xmath76 here @xmath77 k is the present temperature of cmbr and @xmath78 is the present number density of photons and expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the reduced planck constant . for the case of @xmath61 and @xmath81 , @xmath82",
    "thus , the size @xmath75 is expressed as a function of the temperature @xmath83    next , we estimate @xmath68 before the recombination . assuming that the universe has no net charge , the number density of electrons @xmath84 is written as @xmath85 the last value is , again , for the case of @xmath61 and @xmath81 . from  @xcite , @xmath86 where @xmath87 thus , @xmath88    from @xmath75 and @xmath68 derived above , @xmath73 is estimated to be @xmath89 this diffusion time scale is so large that the effect of diffusion is negligible .",
    "matters are assumed to completely decouple from radiation after the recombination .",
    "thus , @xmath90 and @xmath75 after the recombination are denoted as functions of the gas temperature @xmath33 , @xmath91 and @xmath92 here the temperature @xmath93 when free electrons recombine with hydrogen ions is about 5,500 k due to the higher density .",
    "we have assumed that all of helium and hydrogen atoms are neutral in this stage .",
    "therefore the cross section for helium atoms becomes of the order of @xmath94 .",
    "accordingly , @xmath68 becomes @xmath95 the diffusion timescale is obtained as a constant value .",
    "@xmath96 this diffusion time is also too large .      since the region with enhanced helium content has a much higher density than the surrounding region , the region accretes matters from the outside , which might dilute the helium fraction . for simplicity , the timescale of this process is estimated assuming the bondi accretion @xcite .",
    "the time scale of the bondi accretion is inferred from the relation @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the total mass of the region ( @xmath1 in this case ) , @xmath99 and @xmath100 are the density and the sound speed at infinity .",
    "the eigen value of the steady state solution @xmath101 is a function of the adiabatic index @xmath102 written as @xmath103 the values of @xmath99 and @xmath100 are taken from those in the surrounding region with @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "they change as the universe expands and can be written as functions of temperature , @xmath106 where @xmath33 after the recombination denotes the gas temperature .",
    "similarly , @xmath100 is expressed as @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the mean molecular weight and @xmath109 is the radiation energy constant @xmath110 .",
    "thus , the accretion time scale @xmath111 becomes @xmath112 this result means that the time scale of accretion before the recombination is long enough to avoid dilution of helium , while the time scale after the recombination becomes significantly shorter than the hubble time at that epoch .",
    "this indicates that the average helium content reduces considerably .",
    "however , if we take the effect of self - gravity into account , star formation might precede the dilution of helium depending on the effectiveness of turbulent mixing .",
    "the jeans length @xmath113 of the system before the recombination is @xmath114 and the jeans mass @xmath115 is @xmath116 therefore as long as the matter is ionized the mass of the helium rich region never exceeds the jeans mass . on the other hand ,",
    "the jeans mass in this region reduces to @xmath117 immediately after the recombination .",
    "the helium rich region collapses on the time scale of @xmath118 sec , much shorter than the accretion time scale at the temperature of @xmath119 k , _ i.e. _ , @xmath120 sec ( see equation ( [ accretion ] ) for before recombination ) .",
    "this preceding collapse might avoid overall mixing of the helium rich matter with the accreted ambient matter .",
    "the resultant cloud consists of helium rich core surrounded by a primordial gas with the normal helium content .",
    "though there is no widely accepted scenario for the formation of a gc , we raise possible routes to realize gcs with multiple main sequence .",
    "subsequent star formation both in the core and envelope could lead to a star cluster with double main sequence resembling @xmath0 centauri . to reproduce a gc like ngc 2808 , two such clouds with different @xmath10 s in helium",
    "rich cores are needed to collide and trigger star formations in each of regions with three different @xmath10 s .",
    "the collision with a high velocity removes stars that have formed before .",
    "this may also reduce the star - to - star scatter in metallicities . as a result ,",
    "stars in the thus formed cluster have main sequences with three different helium contents and have similar metallicities .",
    "these features are observed for stars in ngc 2808 .",
    "cloud - cloud collisions have been raised as a possible mechanism for the globular cluster formation @xcite .",
    "young stellar clusters found in merging galaxies @xcite and near the center of the milky way galaxy @xcite support this mechanism .",
    "we calculated the bbn for several values of @xmath12 and @xmath27 and looked for the parameter region where the helium enrichment in the gcs is reproduced .",
    "we set lower limits of @xmath12 to be @xmath121 for @xmath46 , @xmath122 for @xmath53 , and @xmath123 for @xmath54 .",
    "the upper limits come from metal abundances and the allowed parameter region for the case of @xmath46 is @xmath124 . if an inhomogeneity caused by the affleck - dine baryogenesis made a region with @xmath12 and @xmath27 in these criterions , the helium abundance is enhanced and the region can end up with gcs , showing multiple main sequences .",
    "our model predicts that the abundances of heavy elements with @xmath125 is enhanced in the bms stars .",
    "stars in our model are expected to have more concentrated spatial distribution of the bms stars than the rms as was recently reported for @xmath0 centauri @xcite because the bms stars are formed in the central part of the helium enhanced region while the rms stars are formed in the outer envelope in our model .",
    "a problem of the affleck - dine baryogenesis is that it can be adopted to antimatters as well as ordinary matters and can create regions with enhanced antimatters .",
    "as there are no observations of such regions with antimatters , there should be some mechanism that stops the generation of antimatters or there must be another baryogenesis mechanism to exclusively enhance ordinary matters up to @xmath126 in small regions .",
