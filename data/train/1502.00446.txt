    "operation techniques embedded with the formalism of the evolution operator have played a central role in the study of time dependent problems in quantum mechanics .",
    "the associated technicalities have attracted the attention of physicists @xcite and mathematicians @xcite , who provided tools of crucial importance to deal with the study of the time dependent schrdinger equation .",

    "our aim is to push forward previous investigations of solutions to the relativistic evolution equation involving fractional derivatives , namely the relativistic schrdinger ( called also salpeter s ) equation @xcite , and to compare them with operationally obtained solutions to the dirac - type and klein - gordon equations .",
    "the main motivation of this research is that fundamental relativistic wave equations give results whose interpretation based on hamiltonian mechanics concepts , as well as explanations of arising paradoxes ( like zitterbewegung or the klein paradox ) , still remains controversial @xcite and need clarification . in our opinion",
    "the use of fractional derivatives or of pseudo - differential operators , to treat relativistic quantum problems , allows a more complete understanding of longstanding problems associated with nonlocal evolution problems .",
    "these problems , once considered academic , have in recent years acquired a more concrete flavour , mainly in the context of the so - called quantum simulation , namely the possibility of `` simulating '' quantum nonrelativistic effects in condensed matter and atomic physics @xcite .",

    "<S> the use of operator methods of algebraic nature is shown to be a very powerful tool to deal with different forms of relativistic wave equations . </S>",
    "<S> the methods provide either exact or approximate solutions for various forms of differential equations , such as relativistic schrdinger , klein - gordon and dirac . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the free particle hypotheses and those relevant to particles subject to non - trivial potentials . in the latter case </S>",
    "<S> we will show how the proposed method leads to easily implementable numerical algorithms . </S>"
