    "over the last twenty five years i have produced several published versions of a catalogue of galactic snrs , along with more detailed web - based versions ( most recently in 2006 ) .",
    "here i present an updated version of the catalogue , now containing 274 remnants .",
    "details of the catalogue are presented in section  [ s : catalogue ] , including notes on the snrs added and removed since 2004 .",
    "section  [ s : discussion ] briefly discusses some simple statistics of the objects in the current catalogue , and reviews the selection effects that apply to the identification of snrs .",
    "the current version of the catalogue contains 274 snrs , and is based on research in the published literature up to the end of 2008 . for each remnant in the catalogue",
    "the following parameters are given .",
    "* * galactic coordinates * of the source centroid , quoted to a tenth of a degree as is conventional .",
    "( note : in this catalogue additional leading zeros are not used . ) * * right ascension * and * declination * of the source centroid .",
    "the accuracy of the quoted values depends on the size of the remnant , for small remnants they are to the nearest few seconds of time and the nearest minute of arc respectively , whereas for larger remnants they are rounded to coarser values , but are in every case sufficient to specify a point within the boundary of the remnant .",
    "these coordinates are almost always deduced from radio images rather than from x - ray or optical observations , and are for j2000.0 . * * angular size * of the remnant , in arcminutes , usually taken from the highest resolution radio image available .",
    "the boundary of most remnants approximates reasonably well to a circle or an ellipse .",
    "a single value is quoted for the angular size of the more nearly circular remnants , which is the diameter of a circle with an area equal to that of the remnant . for elongated remnants the product of two values",
    "is quoted , and these are the major and minor axes of the remnant boundary modelled as an ellipse . in a few cases an ellipse is not a satisfactory description of the boundary of the object ( refer to the description of the individual object given in its catalogue entry ) , although an angular size is still quoted for information . for ` filled - centre ' remnants",
    "the size quoted is for the largest extent of the observed radio emission , not , as at times has been used by others , the half - width of the centrally brightened peak . * * type * of the snr : ` s ' or ` f ' if the remnant shows a ` shell ' or ` filled - centre ' structure , or ` c ' if it shows ` composite ' ( or ` combination ' ) radio structure with a combination of shell and filled - centre characteristics ; or ` s ? ' , ` f ? ' or ` c ? ' , respectively , if there is some uncertainty , or ` ? ' in several cases where an object is conventionally regarded as an snr even though its nature is poorly known or not well - understood .",
    "( note : the term ` composite ' has been used in a different sense , by some authors , to describe snrs with shell radio and centrally - brightened x - ray morphologies .",
    "an alternative term used to describe such remnants is ` mixed morphology ' , see @xcite . ) * * flux density * of the remnant at 1  ghz in jansky .",
    "this is _ not _ a measured value , but is deduced from the observed radio - frequency spectrum of the source . the frequency of 1  ghz is chosen because flux density measurements at frequencies both above and below this value are usually available . * * spectral index * of the integrated radio emission from the remnant , @xmath0 ( here defined in the sense , @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the flux density at a frequency @xmath3 ) , either a value that is quoted in the literature , or one deduced from the available integrated flux densities of the remnant . for several snrs a simple power law is not adequate to describe their radio spectra , either because there is evidence that the integrated spectrum is curved or the spectral index varies across the face of the remnant . in these cases",
    "the spectral index is given as ` varies ' ( refer to the description of the remnant and appropriate references in the detailed catalogue entry for more information ) . in some cases , for example where the remnant is highly confused with thermal emission , the spectral index is given as ` ? ' since no value can be deduced with any confidence .",
    "* * other names * that are commonly used for the remnant .",
    "these are given in parentheses if the remnant is only a part of the source .",
    "for some remnants , notably the crab nebula , not all common names are given .",
    "a summary of the data available for all 274 remnants in the catalogue is given in table  1 .",
    "a more detailed version of the catalogue is available on the world - wide - web from : +    http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/surveys/snrs/     + in addition to the basic parameters which are given in table  1 , the detailed catalogue contains the following information .",
    "( i ) notes if other galactic coordinates have at times been used to label it ( usually before good observations have revealed the full extent of the object , but sometimes in error ) , if the snr is thought to be the remnant of a historical sn , or if the nature of the source as an snr has been questioned ( in which case an appropriate reference is usually given later in the entry ) .",
    "( ii ) short descriptions of the observed structure of the remnant at radio , x - ray and optical wavelengths , as applicable . (",
    "iii ) notes on distance determinations , and any point sources or pulsars in or near the object ( although they may not necessarily be related to the remnant ) .",
    "( iv ) references to observations are given for each remnant , complete with journal , volume , page , and a short description of what information each paper contains ( for radio observations these include the telescopes used , the observing frequencies and resolutions , together with any flux density determinations ) .",
    "these references are _ not _ complete , but cover representative and recent observations of the remnant  up to the end of 2008  and they should themselves include references to earlier work .",
    "the detailed version is available as postscript or pdf for downloading and printing , or as html web pages for each individual remnant .",
    "the web pages include links to the ` nasa astrophysics data system ' for each of the over two thousand references that are included in the detailed listings for individual snrs .    some of the parameters included in the catalogue are themselves of quite variable quality . for example , the radio flux density of each remnant at 1  ghz .",
    "this is generally of good quality , being obtained from several radio observations over a range of frequencies , both above and below 1  ghz . however , for a small number of remnants ( 16 remnants in the current catalogue )  often those which have been identified at other than radio wavelengths  no reliable radio flux density , or only a limit , is available .",
    "also , although the detailed version of the catalogue contains notes on distances for many remnants reported in the literature , these have a range of reliability .",
    "consequently the distances given within the detailed catalogue should be used with caution in any statistical studies .",
    "the follow remnants have been added to the catalogue since the last published version @xcite .",
    "* g32.4@xmath40.1 , identified by @xcite .",

    "as noted above , the detailed catalogue is based on published papers up to the end of 2008 , and hence the catalogue does not include remnants identified more recently ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to the observational selection effects that are discussed further in section  [ s : selection ] , it should be noted that the catalogue is far from homogeneous .",
    "it is particularly difficult to be uniform in terms of which objects are considered as definite remnants , and are included in the catalogue , rather than listed as possible or probable remnants which require further observations to clarify their nature .",
    "although many remnants , or possible remnants , were first identified from wide - area radio surveys , many others have been observed with diverse observational parameters , making uniform criteria for inclusion in the main catalogue difficult .",
    "the detailed version of the catalogue contains notes both on those objects no longer thought to be snrs , and on many possible and probable remnants that have been reported in the literature .    ,",

    "( note that the latitude and longitude axes are not on the same scale.)[f : lb],width=491 ]",
    "there are 16 galactic snrs that are either not detected at radio wavelengths , or are poorly defined by current radio observations , so that their flux density at 1  ghz can not be determined with any confidence : i.e.  94% have a flux density at 1  ghz included in the catalogue . of the catalogued remnants ,",
    "@xmath9% are detected in x - ray , and @xmath10% in the optical . at both of these wavebands ,",
    "galactic absorption hampers the detection of distant remnants .    in the current version of the catalogue , 78% of remnants",
    "are classed as shell ( or possible shell ) , 12% are composite ( or possible composite ) , and 4% are filled - centre ( or possible filled centre ) remnants .",
    "the type of the remaining remnants is not clear from current observations , or else they are objects which are conventionally regarded as snrs although they do not fit well into any of the conventional types ( e.g.  ctb80 ( @xmath8(69.0)+(2.7 ) ) , msh 17@xmath73_9 _ ( @xmath8(357.7)-(0.1 ) ) ) .",
    "although several galactic snrs have been identified at other than radio wavelengths , in practice the dominant selection effects are those that are applicable at radio wavelengths .",
    "simplistically , two selection effects apply to the identification of galactic snrs due to the difficulty in identifying ( i ) faint remnants and ( ii ) small angular size remnants ( see @xcite for more detailed discussions ) .    in terms of surface brightness , which is distance - independent , the wide - area radio surveys covering the galactic plane mean that the catalogue is thought to be complete down to about @xmath11 @xcite .",
    "[ f : sigma ] shows a histogram of @xmath12 for the 258 remnants in the current catalogue for which 1-ghz flux densities are available , and also for those remnants included in the catalogue since the 2004 version .",
    "this shows that the majority of newly identified remnants are indeed fainter than nominal completeness limit of @xmath13 .",
    "most of these are from the deep survey of a limited region of the galactic plane by @xcite ( see section  [ s : new ] above ) .",
    "the are a few newly - identified remnants that are brighter than the nominal surface brightness completeness limit of the catalogue of @xmath13 .",
    "the brightest two of these , namely ( 337.2)+(0.1 ) and ( 350.1)-(0.3 ) , both have relatively small angular sizes ( @xmath14 arcmin ) .",
    "such small snrs are difficult to identify because their structure is not easily recognised without high enough resolution observations .",
    "it is difficult to quantify the angular size selection effect ",
    "see @xcite for some further discussion  but fig .",
    "[ f : theta ] shows a histogram of the observed angular sizes of remnants in the current catalogue .",
    "( note : for elongated remnants , which have angular sizes given as @xmath15 arcmin@xmath16 in the catalogue , a single diameter of @xmath17 has been used in this histogram . ) since much of the galactic plane is now covered by several recent radio surveys  the canadian / vla / southern galactic plane surveys , see @xcite  with a resolution of @xmath18  arcmin , systematic searches using these should be able to identify small angular size remnants that have not been recognised in previous surveys with lower resolution .    due to these selection effects , care has to be taken in using the catalogue for statistical studies .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ f : lb ] shows the distribution of both ( a ) _ all _ snrs , and ( b ) the brighter ones ( with @xmath19 ) , to illustrate the surface brightness selection effect .",
    "this shows that relatively many more remnants are seen in the 2nd and 3rd galactic quadrants and away from @xmath20 , when looking at the whole catalogue rather than the brighter remnants .",
    "this is expected , as the galactic background is fainter in these regions , and hence it is easier to identify faint snrs here .",
    "in addition to selection effects that apply to the identification of galactic snrs , many statistical studies also require distances for all remnants .",
    "the surface brightness ",
    "diameter ( ` @xmath21 ' ) relation is often used for such studies , but  as has been discussed in @xcite  there are problems with this method given the large range of properties shown by galactic snrs , and the observational selection effects .",
    "also , as discussed in detail in @xcite , it should be noted that some @xmath21 relations in the literature ( e.g. ) have been derived using least - squares regression minimising deviation in terms of @xmath22 , rather than in terms of @xmath23 . as the @xmath21 relation is used to derive a diameter ( and hence distance ) from an observed surface brightness , then least - squares in terms of @xmath23",
    "is appropriate . given the large scatter in the observed properties of snrs with known distances , then using a least - square regression in terms of @xmath22 leads to a significantly flatter @xmath21 slope than if a regression in terms of @xmath23 is used .",
    "this leads to an overestimate of the diameters , and hence distances , for all faint remnants .",
    "i am grateful to many colleagues for numerous comments on , and corrections to , the various versions of the galactic snr catalogue .",
    "this research has made use of nasa s astrophysics data system bibliographic services ."
