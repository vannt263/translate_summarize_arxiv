    "the suppression of heavy quarkonium production has been the subject of intense studies as it was proposed as a signature for the quark - gluon plasma @xcite .",
    "recent experimental observations of an anomalous @xmath0 suppression in pb+pb collisions by the na50 collaboration @xcite have aroused a great deal of interest @xcite .",
    "there is , however , considerable uncertainty concerning the role of the produced hadrons on the suppression of @xmath0 production . in order to confirm that the suppression of @xmath0 comes from the presence of the quark - gluon plasma , it is necessary to understand how the produced hadrons may affect the suppression of @xmath0 production so that the desired signal from the quark - gluon plasma can be separated out .",
    "we shall study three different mechanisms of @xmath0 and charmonium dissociation in a hadronic medium : spontaneous dissociation , dissociation by thermalization , and dissociation by collision .",
    "we shall briefly summarize these mechanisms in turn .",
    "the interaction between the quark and the antiquark in a heavy quarkonium depends on the temperature of the medium @xcite .",
    "we can understand such a dependence as coming from the change of the quark and gluon fields between the heavy quark pair and the change of the qcd vacuum surrounding the quarkonium .",
    "the former arises from the disorientation of the quark and gauge fields between the heavy - quark pair as temperature increases , while the latter arises from the change of the external pressure which tends to confine the quark with the antiquark . at the deconfinement phase transition temperature",
    ", the confining interaction is expected to vanish .",
    "hadron matter at high temperature provides an altered environment which can lead to the spontaneous dissociation of a heavy quarkonium .    using the @xmath1-@xmath2 interaction as inferred from lattice gauge calculations of karsch @xmath3@xcite , digal , petreczky , and satz",
    "@xcite recently reported theoretical results on the dissociation temperatures of heavy quarkonia .",
    "subsequent analysis using different parametrization of the interaction and selection rules was given in @xcite and will be described below .    to study the behavior of a heavy quarkonium at finite temperatures , we calculate the energy @xmath4 of the heavy quarkonium state @xmath5 from the schr \" odinger equation @xcite @xmath6 where the energy @xmath4 is measured relative to the pair of lowest - mass mesons at @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the masses of the open heavy - quark mesons , and @xmath10 fm . we represent the interaction @xmath11 , as inferred from lattice gauge calculations of karsch @xmath3@xcite , by a yukawa plus an exponential potential @xcite @xmath12    = -6 = -2.8 in where @xmath13\\theta(t_c - t)$ ] , @xmath14 gev@xmath15 , @xmath16 gev , and @xmath17 is the deconfinement phase transition temperature .",

    "the results are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "a state label along the curve denotes the onset of the occurrence when that state emerges above its dissociation threshold .",
    "as one observes , the survival probability @xmath27 decreases with increasing temperature in a step - wise manner , and it becomes quite small as one approaches the transition temperature .",
    "a heavy quarkonium can dissociate into an open charm pair by collision with hadrons through reactions of the type @xmath28 . as the temperature of the medium increases , the quarkonium state energy changes ( fig",

    "we observe in fig .  3 that the maximum values of the dissociation cross sections increase and the positions of the maxima shift to lower kinetic energies as the temperature increases .",
