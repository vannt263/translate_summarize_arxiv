    "a single- and multi- gene duplication plays crucial role in evolution @xcite . on the proteinomic level",
    ", the gene duplication leads to a creation of new proteins that are initially identical to the original ones .",
    "in a course of subsequent evolution , the majority of these new proteins are lost as redundant , while some of them survive by diverging , i.e. quickly loosing old and possibly slowly acquiring new functions .",
    "the protein - protein interaction network is commonly defined as an evolving graph with nodes and links corresponding to proteins and their interactions .",
    "thus a successful single - gene duplication event results in a creation of a new node which is initially linked to all the neighbors of the original node .",
    "later , some links between each of the duplicates and their neighbors disappear , fig .  ( [ fig_uno ] ) . such network evolution process is commonly called a duplication and divergence @xcite .",
    "although duplication and divergence is usually considered as the growth mechanism only for protein - protein networks , it also may play a role in a creation of certain new nodes and links in the world wide web , growth of various networks of human contacts by introduction of close acquaintances of existing members , and evolution of many other non - biological networks .     a sketch of duplication and divergence event .",
    "links between the duplicated vertex and vertices 3 and 4 disappeared as a result of divergence . ]",
    "does the evolution dominated by duplication and divergence define the structure and other properties of a network ?",
    "so far , most of the attention has been attracted to the study of a degree distribution @xmath0 , which is a probability for a vertex to have @xmath1 links .",
    "wagner @xcite has provided a numerical evidence that duplication - divergence evolution does not noticeably alter the initial power - law degree distribution , provided that the evolution is initiated with a fairly large network .",
    "a somewhat idealized case of the completely asymmetric divergence @xcite when links are removed only from one of the duplicates ( as in fig .  [ fig_uno ] ) was investigated in refs .",
    "it was found that the emerging degree distribution has a power - law tail : @xmath2 for @xmath3 .",
    "yet apart from the shape of the degree distribution , a number of other perhaps even more fundamental properties of duplication - divergence networks remain unclear :    1 .   how well does the model describe its natural prototype , the protein - protein networks ? 2 .",
    "is the total number of links a self - averaging quantity ? 3 .",
    "how does the average total number of links depend on the network size @xmath4 ?",
    "4 .   does the degree distribution scale linearly with @xmath4 ?",
    "a non - trivial answer to any of these questions would be much more important than details of the tail of the degree distribution ; the reason why only these details are usually studied is that the more fundamental questions are assumed to have trivial answers .",
    "here we shall attempt to answer above questions and we shall also look again at the degree distribution of the duplication - divergence networks . as in @xcite",
    ", we consider a simple scenario of totally asymmetric divergence , where evolution is characterized by a single parameter , link retention probability @xmath5 .",
    "it turns out that even such idealized model describes the degree distribution found in the biological protein - protein networks very well .",
    "we find that , depending on @xmath5 , the behavior of the system is extremely diverse : when more than a half of links are ( on average ) preserved , the network growth is non - self - averaging , the average degree diverges with the network size , and while a degree distribution has a scaling form , it does not resemble any power law . in a complimentary case of small @xmath5",
    "the growth is self - averaging , the average degree tends to a constant , and a degree distribution approaches a scaling power - law form .    in the next section",
    "we formally define the model and compare the simulated degree distribution to the observed ones .",
    "the properties of the model are first analyzed in the tractable @xmath6 and @xmath7 limits ( sec .",
    "iii ) and then in the general case @xmath8 ( sec .",
    "section v gives conclusions .",
    "to keep the matter as simple as possible , we focus on the completely asymmetric version of the model of duplication and divergence network growth .",
    "the model is defined as follows ( fig.[fig_uno ] ) :    1 .",
    "* duplication*. a randomly chosen target node is duplicated , that is its replica is introduced and connected to each neighbor of the target node .",
    "2 .   * divergence*. each link emanating from the replica is activated with probability @xmath9 ( this mimics link disappearance during divergence ) .",
    "if at least one link is established , the replica is preserved ; otherwise the attempt is considered as a failure and the network does not change .",
    "( the probability of the failure is @xmath10 if the degree of the target node is equal to @xmath1 . )    in contrast to duplication - mutation models ( see e.g. @xcite ) , no new links are introduced .",
    "initial conditions apparently do not affect the structure of the network when it becomes sufficiently large ; in the following , we always assume that the initial network consists of two connected nodes . as in the observed protein - protein interaction networks , in this model",
    "each node has at least one link and the network remains connected throughout the evolution .",
    "these features is the main distinction between our model and earlier models ( see e.g. @xcite ) which allowed an addition of nodes with no links and generated disconnected networks with questionable biological relevance .",
    "the above simple rules generate networks which are strikingly similar to the naturally occurring ones .",
    "this is evident from figs .",
    "[ fig_yeast][fig_human ] which compare the degree distribution of the simulated networks and protein - protein binding networks of baker yeast , fruit fly , and human .",
    "the protein interaction data for all three species were obtained from the biological association network databases available from ariadne genomics @xcite . the data for human ( _ h .",

    "these figures also show that the degree distributions of both simulated and naturally occurring networks are not exactly resembling power - laws that they are commonly fitted to ( see , for example , @xcite ) .",
    "a possible explanation is that the protein - protein networks ( naturally limited to few tens thousand of nodes ) are not large enough for a degree distribution to converge to its power - law asymptotics . to probe the validity of this argument we present ( fig .  [ fig_simul ] ) the degree distributions for networks of up to @xmath19 vertices with link retention probability similar to the fitted to the observed networks , @xmath20 .",

    "here we analyze duplication - divergence networks in the limits @xmath24 and @xmath25 when the model is solvable and ( almost ) everything can be computed analytically .",
    "this case has already been investigated in refs .",
    "@xcite . here",
    "we outline its properties as it will help us to pose relevant questions in the general case when divergence is present .    when @xmath24 , each duplication attempt is successful and the network remains a complete bipartite graph throughout the evolution : initially it is @xmath26 ; at the next stage the network turns into @xmath27 or @xmath28 , equiprobably ; and generally when the number of nodes reaches @xmath4 , the network is a complete graph @xmath29 with every value @xmath30 occurring equiprobably . in the complete bipartite graph @xmath29 the degree of a node has one of the two possible values : @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "hence in any realization of a @xmath6 network , the degree distribution is the sum of two delta functions : @xmath33 .",
    "averaging over all realizations we obtain @xmath34 the total number of links @xmath35 in the complete graph @xmath29 is @xmath36 .",
    "averaging over all @xmath31 we can compute any moment @xmath37 ; for instance , the mean is equal to @xmath38 and the mean square is given by @xmath39    in the thermodynamic limit @xmath40 , the link distribution @xmath41 becomes a function of the single scaling variable @xmath42 , namely : @xmath43 with @xmath44 .",
    "the key feature of the networks generated without divergence ( @xmath24 ) is the lack of self - averaging .",
    "in other words , fluctuations do not vanish in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "this is evident from eqs .",
    "( [ lav])([pnl ] ) : in the self - averaging case we would have had @xmath45 ( instead of the actual value @xmath46 ) and the scaling function @xmath47 would be the delta function .",
    "the lack of self - averaging implies that the future is uncertain  a few first steps of the evolution drastically affect the outcome .",
    "finally we mention that the @xmath24 limit of our model is equivalent to the classical plya s urn model @xcite .",
    "the urn models have been studied in the probability theory @xcite , have applications ranging from biology @xcite to computer science @xcite , and remain in the focus of the current research ( see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "let @xmath49 . then in a successful duplication attempt ,",
    "the probability of retaining more than one link is very small ( of the order of @xmath9 ) . ignoring it",
    ", we conclude that in each successful duplication event , one node and only one link are added , so when @xmath49 the emerging networks are trees .",
    "if the degree of the target node is @xmath1 , the probability of the successful duplication is @xmath50 which approaches @xmath51 when @xmath52 .",
    "hence any of the @xmath1 neighbors of the target node will be linked to the potentially duplicated node with the same probability @xmath9 .",
    "a given node * n * links to the new , duplicated , node in a process which starts with choosing a neighbor of * n * as the target node .",
    "the probability of that is proportional to the degree @xmath53 of the node * n*. then the probability of linking to the node * n * is @xmath9 ( as we already established ) so the probability that the new node links to * n * is proportional to its degree @xmath53 .",
    "thus we recover the standard preferential attachment model @xcite .",
    "this model exhibits the well - known behavior : the total number of links is @xmath54 , and the degree distribution is a self - averaging quantity peaked around the average , @xmath55",
    "we now move on to the discussion of the general case which is only partially understood .",
    "self - averaging of any quantity can be probed by analyzing a relative magnitude of fluctuations of that quantity . as a quantitative measure we shall use the ratio of the standard deviation to the average . for the total number of links",
    ", @xmath57 should vanish in the thermodynamic limit if the total number of links is the self - averaging quantity .",
    "a lack of self - averaging would be extremely important  it would imply that a slight deviation in the earlier development could lead to a very different outcome . even if @xmath58 vanishes in the thermodynamic limit , fluctuations may still play noticeable role if @xmath58 approaches zero too slowly .     vs. @xmath4 for ( top to bottom ) @xmath59 .",

    "we performed a number of simulation runs where links between a target node and its image were added at each duplication step with a probability @xmath171 .",
    "introduction of such links is the most direct way to prevent partitioning of the network into a bipartite graph ( see @xcite ) . in other words , without such links the target and duplicated nodes are never directly connected to each other .",
    "we observed that for reasonable values of @xmath172 ( in the observed yeast , fly , and human protein - protein networks @xmath171 never exceeds this value ) the results remain unaffected .",
    "apparently , without randomly introduced links , the network characteristics establish themselves independently in every subset of vertices duplicated from each originally existing node .",
    "we leave more systematic study of the effects of mutations as well as of the more symmetric divergence scenarios ( when links may be lost both on the target and duplicated node ) for the future .",
