    "the use of linear resonators for the mitigation of resonant vibrations was first proposed by watts @xcite and frahm @xcite to reduce the rolling motion of ships .",
    "the problem was later formalized in more rigorous terms by ormondroyd and den hartog @xcite , den hartog @xcite and brock @xcite , who developed tuning rules that formed the basis of _ den hartog s equal - peak method_. the vibration absorber considered in @xcite consists of a mass - spring - dashpot system attached to the primary system to be controlled . through the proper tuning of the spring and damper of the absorber , it is possible to approximately obtain @xmath0 optimization of the frequency response in the vicinity of the target resonant frequency .",
    "thanks to its simplicity , effectiveness , low cost and small requirements for maintenance @xcite , the passive vibration absorber ( often referred to as tuned mass damper , tuned vibration absorber or dynamic vibration absorber ) was extensively studied and implemented in real - life structures .",
    "its main applications include structures subject to human - induced vibrations , such as spectator stands and pedestrian bridges ( the most famous example is the millenium bridge in london @xcite ) , steel structures excited by machines such as centrifuges and fans , aircraft engines @xcite , helicopter rotors @xcite , tall and slender structures subject to wind - induced vibrations , but also power lines @xcite and long - span suspended bridges @xcite . for a list of installations of vibration absorbers in civil structures the interested reader can refer to @xcite .    an overview of existing designs for passive vibration absorbers is given in @xcite .",
    "they include classical absorbers with translational mass movements , pendulum absorbers , centrifugal pendulum absorbers @xcite , ball absorbers , sloshing liquid absorbers @xcite and particle vibration absorbers @xcite , although the sloshing liquid and particle vibration absorbers have qualitatively different features than the more typical vibration absorbers with a concentrated mass .",
    "many different configurations and variations of the original vibration absorber were studied in the last decades , e.g. , a damped host system @xcite , different combinations of response and excitation @xcite and the use of multi - vibration absorbers to control several resonances @xcite .",
    "a fundamental drawback of the vibration absorber ( that hereafter is referred to as linear tuned vibration absorber , ltva ) is that it requires a fine tuning between its natural frequency and the targeted resonant frequency .",
    "the ltva may therefore be ineffective when it is attached to nonlinear systems , in view of the frequency - amplitude dependence of these systems .",
    "this limitation was addressed in the literature through the development of nonlinear vibration absorbers @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", the authors introduced the nonlinear tuned vibration absorber ( nltva ) , whose design is based on a principle of similarity with the nonlinear primary system , i.e. , the nltva should be governed by equations similar to those of the primary system .",
    "thanks to this principle , a nonlinear generalization of den hartog s equal - peak method could be developed , and the optimal nonlinear coefficient of the nltva was determined numerically @xcite .",
    "a more detailed study about the performance and robustness of the nltva was carried out in @xcite , whereas it was experimentally validated in @xcite .",
    "the nltva was also successfully applied for the mitigation of limit cycle oscillations @xcite .",
    "this paper revisits the design procedure of the nltva proposed in @xcite .",
    "specifically , by combining a harmonic balance technique with a perturbation method , it derives a compact analytical formula for the nonlinear coefficient of the absorber which is valid for any polynomial nonlinearity in the primary system .",
    "the case where the primary system comprises several nonlinearities is also carefully investigated in this study .",
    "in this study , we seek to minimize the amplitude at resonance of a harmonically - forced one - degree - of - freedom ( 1dof ) nonlinear oscillator which models the targeted mode of the considered nonlinear system .",
    "this is achieved by attaching a nonlinear vibration absorber to the primary oscillator .",
    "mathematically , the problem is formulated as follows : @xmath1\\right\\ } \\rightarrow |h\\left(\\omega_a\\right)|=|h\\left(\\omega_b\\right)|\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the frequency response function of the coupled system measured at the primary mass , and @xmath3 represents the two resonance frequencies .      for linear absorbers coupled to linear oscillators , den hartog @xcite demonstrated that the frequency response function passes through two fixed points independent of absorber damping , and he selected the absorber stiffness that imposes equal amplitude for these points ( fig .  [ linear ] ) .",
    "brock @xcite then calculated the absorber damping by taking the mean of the damping values that realize a maximum of the receptance at the two fixed points . even though the resulting formulas have sufficient accuracy in practice , they are only an approximation to problem [ probform ] , because @xmath4 is not strictly equal to @xmath5 .",
    "nishihara and asami @xcite were the first to derive an exact solution to problem [ probform ] .",
    "instead of imposing two fixed points of equal amplitude , the direct minimization of the @xmath6 norm of the frequency response of the controlled structure was achieved .",
    "eventually , exact analytical formulas were obtained for the frequency tuning @xmath7 and damping ratios @xmath8 : @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass ratio ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 are defined later ) .",
