    "in nature , we can hardly find true elementary particles .",
    "basically most of them are composite particles made of even more elementary constituents .",
    "these constituents are fermions .",
    "fermions obey the pauli principle , i.e.  they can not occupy the same quantum state . on the other hand , when we try to place two composite particles at the same location we try to force that the constituents to occupy the same quantum state .",
    "the quantum system tries to prevent this and we observe the phenomena of pauli blocking .    the simplest way to model the pauli blocking is to use a local repulsive short range potential .",
    "this suppresses the wave function at short distances and reduce the probability of finding the constituents there . since the pauli blocking depends strongly on quantum numbers these type of potentials exhibit a strong dependence on partial waves .",
    "in fact , the pauli blocking is a restriction on the hilbert space . for composite particles",
    "the available hilbert space is not the same as for structureless particles .",
    "those states , which are occupied by the constituents , are absent or suppressed in the relative motion .",
    "there are several models for composite particle interaction , based on cluster model , which , more or less , follow this philosophy .",
    "probably the most elaborated is the fish - bone model by schmid @xcite . in the fish - bone potential the fully pauli",
    "forbidden states are removed from the hilbert space .",
    "this model also uses the concept of partly pauli forbidden states , whose contribution is suppressed . as a result ,",
    "the fish - bone potential is a combination of local and non - local terms .",
    "the structure of non - locality is determined by the internal structure of the constituents and the local potential is to be determined from a fitting procedure .",
    "in the fish - bone model we put all the information about the internal structure of the composite particle in their mutual interaction and we hope that we will achieve some simplification in parameters .",
    "unfortunately , this was only partly true .",
    "in the case of the @xmath2 fish - bone potential , the parametrization of ref .",
    "@xcite provided a good description of the two - body experimental phase shift , but it needed quite a sizable three - body potential to get the correct binding energy for the three-@xmath3 system @xcite .    in a recent study we reexamined the @xmath2 fish - bone potential @xcite .",
    "we fitted the fish - bone potential to the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 experimental phase shifts , the @xmath4 two-@xmath3 resonant state and the low energy three-@xmath3 ground and excited states .",
    "we found that a single gaussian term in the local part of the fish - bone potential provides a reasonably good description of all these data .",
    "there is no need for any explicit angular momentum dependence and there is no need for a three - body potential . if the composite structure of the particles is properly built into the non - locality of the interaction , the fitted local part of the potential became really simple .",
    "the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fish - bone potential has been determined in ref .  @xcite . for the local part of the potential",
    ", the authors adopted a wood - saxon shape with a spin - orbit term .",
    "although they observed an excellent fit to the experimental phase shifts , the agreement was achieved by using independent parameters for each partial wave and different strength parameters for the spin - orbit term for partial waves @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    however , some of the parameters are rather close to each other .",
    "so , it may be possible to find a better parametrization of this potential which is , in the spirit of the fish - bone model , simple and does not have explicit angular momentum dependence .",
    "maybe , the angular momentum dependence we observe in nature , entirely comes from the composite structure of the alpha particles .    in sec .",
    "ii we outline the fish - bone optical model . in sec .",
    "iii we specialize it to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 case and present our results . in sec .",
    "iv we summarize and draw some conclusions .",
    "the fish - bone model has been derived from the resonating group model . in the resonating group model",
    "the total wave function is an antisymmetrized product of the cluster @xmath9 and the inter - cluster @xmath10 relative states @xmath11 the state @xmath9 describes the internal properties of the clusters , including the spin and isospin structure .",
    "the unknown relative motion state @xmath10 is determined from the variational ansatz @xmath12 this results in a rather complicated equation for @xmath10 , which is possible to solve only by using strong approximations on @xmath9 and on the interaction of the particles . in a typical example @xmath9 describes fermions in harmonic oscillator potential wells located at some distance apart and @xmath10 is the relative motion of the oscillator wells .",
    "it is easy to see that if @xmath10 is expressed in terms of harmonic oscillator states , some of the lowest states in the relative motion space are not allowed due to the pauli principle .",
    "the fish - bone model is a model for the relative motion @xmath10 @xcite .",
    "it is defined by an effective hamiltonian @xmath13 where @xmath14 refers to the angular momentum channel , @xmath15 is the kinetic energy operator and @xmath16 is a local potential .",
    "our knowledge about the internal structure @xmath9 and on the pauli principle are incorporated in the last term .",
    "the states @xmath17 are eigenstates of the norm operator , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the center of mass distance of the two clusters . if the relative motion is forbidden by pauli principle then @xmath20 , and @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath22 eigenvalues are ordered such that @xmath23 .",
    "the matrix @xmath24 is then given by @xmath25^{1/2 } } , & \\text{if $ i \\le j$ } , \\\\",
    "1-\\frac { \\displaystyle   1-\\eta_{p , j } } { \\displaystyle    [ ( 1-\\bar{\\eta}_{p , j } ) ( 1-\\bar{\\eta}_{p , i})]^{1/2 } } , &    \\text{if $ i > j$ } ,   \\end{cases}\\ ] ] where @xmath26 if @xmath21 and @xmath27 otherwise . if the system has only one pauli - forbidden sate , the matrix @xmath24 , which exhibits a fish - bone - like structure , is given by @xmath28    we can see that in the hamiltonian ( [ fishh ] ) the matrix elements of @xmath29 are eliminated or partly suppressed by the fish - bone term . if a state @xmath17 is fully pauli forbidden , then the corresponding elements of @xmath29 are removed and from @xmath30 . consequently , @xmath17 becomes a solution of the schrdinger equation at zero energy . or , if we take @xmath31 nonzero in @xmath30 , for pauli forbidden states only , the corresponding @xmath17 become solutions at @xmath32 energy . in the fish - bone model",
    "we take @xmath32 as a large positive number .",
    "then the states at physically accessible energies become orthogonal to the pauli forbidden states .",
    "if the pauli - forbidden state is like a ground state harmonic oscillator wave function , i.e.  it is without any node , then the physical states has to be orthogonal to the pauli forbidden state and must have a node .",
    "so , the fish - bone model simulates the pauli blocking by a node in the wave function at short distances .",
    "we adopt a model that in the @xmath3 particles the nucleons are in @xmath33 states in a harmonic oscillator well of width parameter @xmath34 .",
    "the norm kernel eigenvalues @xmath35 are also harmonic oscillator states with the same width parameter @xcite .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath22 in the @xmath36 channel are given by @xmath37 , and in the @xmath7 and @xmath8 channels are given by @xmath38 .",
    "so , we have only one fully pauli - forbidden sate in the @xmath36 channel .",
    "the other states are partly pauli forbidden .",
    "we used the experimental phase shift compilation from ref .",
    "@xcite .    the fish - bone model results in a coulomb - like potential with non - local terms .",
    "we solved the equations by using the method of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this method",
    "the problem is written in a lippmann - schwinger integral equation form and the short - range terms are expanded in coulomb - sturmian basis . for the @xmath32 parameter of the fish - bone model , which aims to remove the pauli - forbidden states , we took @xmath39 . in this range of @xmath32 ,",
    "the dependence of the results was beyond the fifth significant digit .",
    "the proton and neutron are spin @xmath40 particles and the proton has a charge .",
    "therefore we seek the local part of the potential as a sum of a smeared coulomb , a central and a spin - orbit term @xmath41 \\frac{v_{so}}{r } \\frac{d}{dr } v(r),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath42 is the spin , @xmath43 is the orbital angular momentum , @xmath44 is the total angular momentum , and @xmath45 for the @xmath0 system and @xmath46 for the @xmath1 system .",
    "we took the harmonic oscillator width parameter @xmath34 and the spin - orbit coupling term @xmath47 as fitting parameters and tried out several forms for @xmath48 .",
    "we achieved an excellent fit to the phase shift values with a double gaussian potential @xmath49 the  best fit ",
    "parameters are @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 .",
    "our results for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scattering are given in figures [ fig1 ] and [ fig2 ] , respectively , and @xmath48 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] .    ,",
    "@xmath7 , and @xmath8 @xmath0 phase shifts.,width=283 ]    , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 @xmath1 phase shifts .",
    ", width=283 ]    .",
    ", width=283 ]    we can see that the @xmath36 phase shifts start at @xmath56 , although neither the @xmath0 nor the @xmath1 system has any bound state .",
    "this seems to be in contradiction to the levinson theorem , which connects the zero - energy phase shift to the number of bound states .",
    "the bound state , which is required by the low energy behavior of the @xmath36 phase shift , is forbidden by the pauli principle .",
    "although the pauli - forbidden states are absent from the spectrum , their effects are clearly visible in the phase shift .",
    "in this work we propose a new parametrization for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 fish - bone potentials .",
    "we determined the parameters of the potential by fitting to the experimental phase shifts .",
    "we found that if we incorporate our knowledge on the charge , the spin and the composite structure into the form of the potential , then the potential to be fitted is really very simple . with the same set of parameters , six parameters altogether , and without any angular momentum dependence in @xmath57 , we achieved a very good description for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 low energy scattering data for all the relevant partial waves . in a forthcoming work we will study this potential in the @xmath58 and @xmath59 systems .",
    "we believe that the fish - bone model deserves further attention .",
    "we can see that the fish - bone model really provides a good account for the composite structure of the constituents and of the pauli principle .",
    "then the local potential , which is to be determined by a fitting procedure , becomes very simple .",
    "we can also conclude that the strong angular dependence of the potentials may be mainly due to inadequate treatment of the internal structure of the composite particles .",
    "the fish - bone model uses the concept of partly pauli forbidden states as well .",
    "so , it can model pauli effect even if there is no complete pauli blocking , like in the nucleon - nucleon potential ."
