    "long ago tarrach  @xcite showed that the pole mass of a quark is infrared - finite and gauge - independent through two - loop order in perturbation theory .",
    "it is widely believed that this result holds through any finite order in perturbation theory .",
    "there does not seem to be a reference in the literature containing a proof , however , and this paper aims to fill that gap . to be specific",
    "i consider qcd with one massive quark and @xmath0 massless quarks , but extra massive quarks do not change the argument .",
    "there are a few reasons why one might suspect infrared divergences to arise in the perturbative - qcd series for the pole mass .",
    "qcd contains massless self - interacting gluons , so the infrared behavior is often worse than for qed . in qcd and qed , infrared divergences",
    "_ do _ arise in the two - loop self energy .",
    "another worry is that the _ non_perturbative pole mass , if at all defined , is clearly very sensitive to the infrared .    on the other hand , the kinematics of qcd , with the quark content under consideration ,",
    "is like that of qed with a massive muon , some massless scalar bosons , and some massless electrons  @xcite . here ( or with @xmath1 large enough to make qcd infrared - free ) nonperturbative problems should not arise in the infrared . for the qed model one can even pick boundary conditions so that gauge - invariant muon states are in the spectrum .",
    "also , the infrared divergence from the two - loop self energy is cancelled by a term from evaluating the one - loop self energy on the one - loop mass shell and iterating  @xcite ; one could hope that this mechanism occurs at any order .",
    "moreover , in asymptotically free qcd a remnant of the anticipated infrared sensitivity appears through renormalons  @xcite ; this implies that perturbation theory can `` know about '' the infrared behavior of nonperturbative qcd without having infrared divergences at fixed order .",
    "the above discussion is nothing but a duel of fears and hopes , and it should be replaced by definitive results .",
    "below it is shown that the infrared divergences cancel in the pole mass , as at two loops , to any order .",
    "it is then a simpler matter to confirm that the pole mass is independent of the gauge chosen for the calculation .",
    "the arguments are straightforward and can be found in textbooks , although , to the best of my knowledge , the specific application is not .",

    "loop momenta are denoted generically by @xmath24 .",
    "to prove infrared - finiteness i follow the methods of chapter  13 of ref .",
    "first , i recall how , in perturbation theory , one finds singularities in green functions .",
    "this analysis establishes that the propagator and the self energy have a branch point at @xmath5 .",
    "since the pole mass requires the self - energy functions to be evaluated here , one must check whether they diverge at the branch point or not .",
    "it turns out that the on - shell self energy does suffer from infrared divergences , but i show that they drop out of the pole mass .",
    "consider an arbitrary feynman diagram ( of any green function ) , with quark propagators rationalized and all denominators combined with feynman parameters  @xmath25 .",

    "the green function is an analytic function of lorentz invariants of the external momenta , up to branch points .",
    "branch points can arise only when  @xmath29 vanishes , but that is not enough .",
    "in addition , the contour of integration ( over feynman parameters  @xmath30 and loop momenta  @xmath24 ) must be pinched  @xcite .",
    "this happens if and only if on each internal line @xmath31 and , furthermore , following any closed path  @xmath32 in the diagram @xmath33 with the sign of @xmath34 taken in the sense of the path  @xmath32 .",
    "equations  ( [ on shell ] ) and  ( [ closed path ] ) are the so - called landau equations .    solutions of the landau equations have a physical interpretation  @xcite .",
    "up to an overall factor the feynman parameter  @xmath25 is the ratio of the time elapsed , from one end of the line to the other , to the energy propagating on the line .",
    "thus ,  @xmath35 is the space - time separation between the two ends , and eq .",
    "( [ closed path ] ) says a loop in the diagram corresponds to a loop in space - time .",

    "obtains the _ reduced diagram _ by shrinking off - shell lines to a point .",
    "then branch points arise if and only if the reduced diagram represents a genuine physical process of on - shell states .",
    "the physical picture given above is useful , because it is often easier to find solutions to eqs .",
    "( [ on shell ] ) and  ( [ closed path ] ) with physical reasoning instead of with algebra . for example",
    ", a two - point function has branch points only at normal thresholds , that is , when  @xmath11 is just right to produce a collection of on - shell particles .",
    "for the massive quark propagator these branch points are at @xmath38 ^ 2,\\ ] ] corresponding to creation of the massive quark plus  @xmath39 massive pairs .",
    "these branch points are accumulations of infinitely many solutions to the landau equations , because once a solution is found , others are given by adding zero - momentum massless lines .",
    "physically , this is because it costs nothing to create an extra soft gluon or extra soft pair .",
    ", the branch points would be at @xmath40 ^ 2 $ ] , so infinitely many collapse to the same point as  @xmath41 . ]",
    "if the solutions accumulate too quickly , an infrared divergence will develop .    on the other hand , note that there are no collinear divergences .",
    "as soon as the massive quark radiates non - zero momentum , it is off shell , and the ( un)physical picture disallows a singularity .      to examine the infrared properties , one performs a power - counting analysis .",
    "one scales some or all loop momenta by a factor @xmath42 ; if the feynman integral scales as @xmath43 as @xmath44 , one says the degree of infrared divergence is  @xmath45 .",
    "for example , in @xmath46  dimensions the momentum - space volume element  @xmath47 has @xmath48 .",
    "if  @xmath49 , an integral is infrared convergent .",
    "the conclusions derived above for arbitrary diagrams apply equally well to the one - particle irreducible ones contributing to the self energy .",
    "it is convenient to route the external momentum  @xmath3 along the `` main line , '' the massive quark line that runs all the way through a self - energy diagram . off the main line",
    "the momenta are independent of  @xmath3 , and the degrees of infrared divergence are straightforward .",

    "soft three - gluon and gluon - ghost vertices contribute @xmath52 , and other soft vertices @xmath53 . in a closed loop the massive quark propagator  @xmath54 has degree of infrared divergence  @xmath55 .",
    "the internal parts of the main line have propagator  @xmath56 . when  @xmath24 is soft @xmath57 off shell ( away from the branch point ) such lines have degree of infrared divergence  @xmath55 . on shell",
    ", however , one treats @xmath58 as higher order in  @xmath20 . ]",
    "@xmath59 which gives degree  @xmath60 .    when all loop momenta are soft and @xmath5 , an arbitrary qcd ( or qed ! ) self - energy diagram  @xmath61 with @xmath15 loops , but no massive quark loops , has degree of infrared divergence @xmath62 in @xmath46 dimensions .",
    "this holds at one loop .",
    "higher - loop diagrams can be built by adding gluons , ghost loops , or ( for now ) massless quark loops .",
    "it is enough to insert the loops into gluon propagators ; more gluons can be added later .",

    "new gluons give @xmath64 , where @xmath46 comes from the new loop , @xmath65 from the gluon propagator , and the @xmath66 are degrees associated with each end .",
    "the ends can be on a gluon or ghost line : @xmath67 for vertex and propagator ; on a three - gluon vertex : @xmath68 from changing the three- to a four - gluon vertex ; on the main line or a massless quark : @xmath68 for the propagator .",
    "thus , these ways all give @xmath63 . replacing an internal @xmath26-vertex polygon of a massless quark with a massive one increases  @xmath69 by  @xmath26 .",
    "therefore , in four dimensions no infrared divergences can arise from the region with all loop momenta soft .",
    "infrared divergences may come , however , from regions with some loop momenta soft and others not . according to the physical picture of the self energy , the non - soft lines can be shrunk to a point , augmenting the foregoing analysis with composite vertices . for @xmath70 ,",

    "composite three - point vertices have the same infrared power counting as their fundamental counterparts . for example",
    ", gauge invariance guarantees the beneficial @xmath52 for the ( composite ) vertex of three soft gluons , in the same way it safeguards renormalizability .",
