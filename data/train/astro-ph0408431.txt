    "@xmath0 centauri ( ngc 5139 ) is , to the best of our knowledge , the most massive globular cluster in the milky way , with a mass around @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it shows peculiar chemical and dynamical features , such as the wide spread in metallicity distribution of member stars @xcite and the difference in kinematics of metal - rich and metal - poor populations @xcite .",
    "some member stars show an enhancement of s - process elements produced by agb stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which means that the potential well must have been deep enough to trap the gas ejected from agb stars @xcite .",
    "a merger model @xcite can explain the kinematics and metallicity spread , but has difficulty in accounting for the presence of s - process elements .",
    "a tidal stripping scenario @xcite has been proposed to explain all observed features simultaneously . in this scenario ,",
    "the cluster was born as a dwarf elliptical galaxy , which was much more massive than the current @xmath0 centauri .",
    "as it sinks to the galactic center through dynamical friction , it loses most of its mass through the tidal stripping by the gravitational potential of the milky way .",
    "however , if the central density is sufficiently high , the core of the dwarf can still survive as a bound system and become a relatively large globular cluster , something like @xmath0 centauri . in this scenario , a relatively long star formation history",
    "is naturally explained because the potential well of the progenitor dwarf elliptical was initially much deeper than that of the present - day @xmath0 centauri .",
    "in addition , since the progenitor dwarf could be formed through hierarchical merging events , signatures of past merging events can also be explained .",
    "furthermore , recently , @xcite reported that some of massive globular clusters in ngc 5128 may also be such tidally stripped dwarf ellipticals .    from the viewpoint of dynamics , whether or not the stripping scenario works depends on the following two questions .",
    "the first one is whether the dynamical friction can bring the progenitor dwarf to the current orbit of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "the second one is whether the tidal stripping can actually produce the observed surface brightness of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "the first question has been addressed by recent work @xcite .",
    "however , the second question has not been studied so far , despite its significance to the validity of the stripping scenario .    in this paper",
    ", we have investigated whether a dwarf galaxy with the orbit similar to that of the present - day @xmath0 centauri will evolve to have the spatial structure which agrees with that of @xmath0 centauri using @xmath1-body simulations . in   2 , numerical models and method are described .",
    "results are shown in   3 .",
    "a discussion is given in ",
    "we consider the dynamical evolution of a dwarf elliptical in a fixed potential . in this paper , we neglect the effects of dynamical friction .",
    "this neglect should not affect results as far as a progenitor dwarf along the present - day orbit of @xmath0 centauri is concerned , since our main goal is to see whether or not the tidal field of the milky way in the present - day orbit of @xmath0 centauri can account for its density structure .",
    "in reality , dynamical friction must have played a certain role in bringing the progenitor dwarf to its current orbit , but that part of evolution is not in the scope of the present paper .",
    "we use the data compiled by @xcite for the surface - brightness profile of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "this profile is well - fitted ( except in the outermost region ) by a king model with a non - dimensional central potential @xmath4 and a core radius @xmath5 .",
    "we choose the total mass of this king model to be identical to the mass suggested from observations , @xmath6 .",
    "then , we set up the model of the progenitor dwarf to have the same core radius and central velocity dispersion , but with a much more extended halo .",
    "we choose a king model with @xmath7 as a model for the dwarf .",
    "since some dwarf elliptical galaxies can also be fitted by a king model , we believe this choice is justified . @xcite have found that a king - like dwarf elliptical can not evolve to @xmath0 centauri on the basis of numerical simulations of king- and hernquist - like dwarf galaxies embedded in a live milky way potential .",
    "this point will be discussed in   4.1 .",
    "the dwarf elliptical is represented by @xmath8 particles of equal mass .",
    "the initial total mass is @xmath9 .",
    "we do not include a dark matter halo of the dwarf , which would be more extended than the distribution of visible stars .",
    "since the extended halo would be stripped out anyway , we believe the presence of a dark matter halo does not change results significantly . in most of our simulations ,",
    "the final cluster still had more than 50,000 particles , with the result that the relaxation time is much longer than the duration of the simulation .",
    "we use two different models for the gravitational potential of the milky way , a singular isothermal sphere ( run std ) and a bulge - disk - halo model ( run mwd ) .",
    "the circular velocity of the std potential is @xmath10 .",
    "the mwd potential is almost the same as the model used in @xcite .",
    "this model consists of three components : a miyamoto - nagai @xcite disk , a hernquist @xcite bulge , and a logarithmic halo potential .",
    "the only difference between the model of @xcite and ours is the core radius of the logarithmic potential .",
    "we set the core radius to be @xmath11 , while @xcite set it to be @xmath12 , so that the circular velocity at the solar circle radius , i.e. , @xmath13 , is @xmath14 .",
    "the potentials and parameters used in simulations are listed in table  [ tab : model ] .",
    "the circular speed curves of these models are plotted in figure  [ fig : model ] .",
    "we use the following kinematical data on @xmath0 centauri : the distance from the sun is @xmath15 , the proper motions are @xmath16 , and the radial velocity is @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "for the most probable values of the proper motions and the radial velocity in the isothermal model ( run std ) , the pericenter and apocenter distances are @xmath18 and @xmath19 , respectively .",
    "we made two other runs , in which we expand the initial dwarf by a factor of 1.5 ( run r15 ) and 2 ( run r20 ) , to see the effect of the change in the tidal force at the pericenter .",
    "for the singular isothermal model , the only characteristic scale in the experiment is the core radius of the cluster .",
    "a linear expansion of the cluster by a factor of 1.5 or 2 can therefore equally well correspond to a reduction in the pericenter distance of the unmodified cluster by a factor of @xmath20 ( run r15 ) or @xmath21 ( run r20 ) , which corresponds to @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "we use a hierarchical tree algorithm @xcite on the grape-6 hardware @xcite with an opening angle being 0.5 .",
    "we employ a plummer softening of @xmath24 , which is roughly one - tenth of the observed core radius of @xmath0 centauri , @xmath25 .",
    "the equations of motion are integrated using a leap - frog method with a constant time - step of @xmath26 .",
    "this time - step is comparable to the time required for a particle with the maximum circular velocity around @xmath0 centauri to cover the softening length .",
    "the total energy was conserved to better than @xmath27 per cent in all simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : snap ] shows snapshot images from run std , along with the orbit of the cluster center for the periods of 0.1 gyr before and after the time for the snapshot ( whenever the orbit is available ) .",
    "the cluster center is defined as the position of the particle with the minimum potential energy for the @xmath1-body particles .",
    "we include all particles to calculate the potential . removing unbound particles",
    "did not affect the result , even after more than 90 per cent of the particles were stripped .",
    "we can see that the stripped stars remain close to the cluster orbit , and form numerous ripple structures .",
    "figure  [ fig : mass ] shows the time evolution of the cluster mass . here",
    ", we define the cluster mass simply as a mass within @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the tidal radius at the apocentric position expressed as @xmath30 here @xmath31 is the distance from the galactic center to the cluster , @xmath32 is the galaxy mass within @xmath31 , and @xmath33 is the cluster mass .",
    "we assume that the stars are stripped from the cluster if their distances from the cluster center are larger than two apocentric tidal radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "for the three - component model , we have determined the cluster mass in the same way .",
    "the cluster mass exhibits periodic sudden drops , which correspond to the pericentric passage .",
    "thus , almost all the mass loss occurred at the pericentric passage .",
    "since the cluster is expanded in runs r15 and r20 , the mass loss is larger for these runs than that for run std .",
    "there is very little difference between the result of run std and that of mwd , suggesting that the disk does not contribute significantly to the tidal force .",
    "this result is of course not surprising , because the disk gravity is small at a pericenter distance of @xmath34 .",
    "figure  [ fig : sden ] shows the final surface - density profiles for all runs .",
    "we assume a constant mass - to - light ratio , since the estimated relaxation time of @xmath0 centauri is too long for the mass segregation to be visible ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "clearly , the result of run std does not agree with observations . replacing the galactic potential with a more realistic one ( run mwd )",
    "does not improve the situation .",
    "on the other hand , changing the pericenter distance has a drastic effect , and the agreement of run r20 with observations is very good .",
    "the result of r15 falls between std and r20 .",
    "we conclude that a tidal stripping scenario involving a king - like progenitor without a dark matter halo can reproduce the observed luminosity profile quite well , provided that the pericentric distance of @xmath0 centauri is around @xmath35 .",
    "our conclusion that a king - like dwarf can evolve to @xmath0 centauri apparently contradicts with the result by @xcite that final clusters started from king - like dwarf ellipticals are still more massive than @xmath36 .",
    "this difference is mainly due to the high velocity dispersion of the initial dwarf models in their simulations .",
    "the central velocity dispersion in their model k5 reaches @xmath37 , while we set it to be @xmath38 .",
    "this means that the cluster mass inside the tidal radius in their model k5 is @xmath39 times larger than the mass in our model , even if the pericenter distance is assumed to be equal . in terms of the fraction of total mass lost ,",
    "their results are actually quite consistent with ours .",
    "we have shown that the observed surface - brightness profile of @xmath0 centauri is nicely reproduced by the tidal stripping scenario if the pericenter distance of the cluster is roughly @xmath35 . here",
    ", we discuss whether such a small pericenter distance is compatible with observations .",
    "we have adopted the following error estimates for observational data .",
    "for the errors in the proper motion and the radial velocity , we have used the data by @xcite : @xmath40 . here , @xmath41 is the relative velocity of @xmath0 centauri to the local standard of rest .",
    "the positive directions of the @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 components are , respectively , outward from the galactic center , toward the galactic rotation , and toward the galactic north pole . for the galactic parameters",
    ", @xcite estimated the ratio of the circular speed to the solar circle radius , @xmath45 , on the basis of the proper motion study of sagittarius a@xmath46 by using vlba , and concluded that the circular speed is @xmath47 , assuming that the solar circle radius is @xmath48 .",
    "for the error in the circular speed at the solar circle , we have adopted the value of @xmath49 .",
    "since the solar circle radius would have an error comparable to that in the circular speed , we have used @xmath50 for the solar circle radius .",
    "we calculated the variations of the pericentric distance due to errors in the orbital velocity of @xmath0 centauri , the solar circle radius , and the circular speed at the solar circle .",
    "the results are summarized in table  [ tab : err ] .",
    "the error in the circular speed has a strong effect on the pericenter distance , since the orbit of @xmath0 centauri is highly eccentric .",
    "a 10 per cent variation in the circular speed can lead to 50 per cent change in the pericenter distance .",
    "the error in the @xmath43 component also has such large magnification .",
    "thus , our result that the pericenter distance must be around @xmath35 is compatible with observations .",
    "we set the total mass of @xmath0 centauri to @xmath6 , following the estimate by @xcite .",
    "however , since this mass estimate is based on a multi - mass king model , the total mass is probably overestimated ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . indeed , in our best - fit king model , the central velocity dispersion reaches @xmath38 , while the observed value is around @xmath51 @xcite . for the observed value of the central velocity dispersion ,",
    "the total mass is around @xmath52 .",
    "this change of the cluster mass reduces the tidal radius by about 15 per cent ( @xmath53 ) . in other words , to yield the observed tidal radius with a reduced cluster mass , the periastron distance in the model would have to be increased by 30 per cent [ from equation ( [ eq : rt ] ) , @xmath54 . therefore ,",
    "if we use this revised estimate of the mass of @xmath0 centauri , the most likely value of the pericenter distance is around @xmath2 .      in section 3",
    ", we have found that the quantitative result remains unchanged when we change the galactic potential model from the singular isothermal sphere to the more realistic three - component model .",
    "however , since we integrated our model only for 0.88 gyr , we could have missed some important contributions of the non - sphericity of the potential .",
    "we integrated the orbit of a point - mass cluster in the three - component potential for @xmath55 . here",
    ", such a long integration time is required since chaotic diffusion time could be much longer than a hubble time .",
    "we have found that the minimum pericentric radius is @xmath56 , although the orbit is chaotic .",
    "consequently , the effect of chaotic diffusion is negligible .",
    "we have found that the structure of @xmath0 centauri is nicely explained by the tidal stripping scenario , for the orbital parameters within the observational errors .",
    "the pericenter distance is the most important parameter that determines the structure of the simulated @xmath0 centauri . in other words",
    ", we can put a fairly tight constraint on the pericenter distance of @xmath0 centauri from its internal structure .",
    "this constraint can be converted to constraints on the galactic potential , such as the circular speed , if we have high - accuracy data for the proper and radial motions of @xmath0 centauri .",
    "we can probably apply a similar technique to other tidally - limited globular clusters , though in this case the modeling is somewhat more complex since we can not ignore thermal relaxation .",
    "clusters in highly eccentric orbits are most useful , since a small change in the galactic parameters results in a large change in the pericenter distance .",
    "thus , the dynamical simulation of the evolution of globular clusters in a galactic tidal field , combined with high - accuracy proper motion data which will be available via next - generation astrometry projects , will provide us with a unique tool to probe the structure of the milky way .",
    "we thank the anonymous referee for useful comments that helped us to improve the clarity of the paper .",
