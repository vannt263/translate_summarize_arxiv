    "this paper and its companion paper  @xcite are part of our program to extend the nijmegen soft - core one - boson - exchange potential  @xcite by including two - meson - exchange potentials . the material presented here",
    "is incorporated into a new extended soft - core nucleon - nucleon model , hereafter referred to as the esc potential .",
    "we are still investigating ways to improve this model as much as possible , but the preliminary version of the esc potential employed in the present paper is here used to illustrate the contributions of the various two - meson exchanges .    in low - energy nucleon - nucleon models , exchanges with an effective mass less than 1 gev",
    "seem to be the most important ones .",
    "the very heavy mesons possibly only play some role for @xmath6 waves , but they can presumably be covered up by the lower - mass mesons .",
    "after one - meson exchange , the effects of two - meson exchanges at low energies seem worthwhile to be investigated and , as we will demonstrate with the esc potential , they indeed provide a major improvement in the theoretical description of the nucleon - nucleon data .",
    "recently , we have evaluated the soft two - pion - exchange potentials in coordinate space , using some new techniques  @xcite .",
    "we noted that these techniques could also be applied to double - meson exchanges where the mesons have different masses .",
    "for the double - meson exchanges we can distinguish two different classes .",
    "the first class consists of the diagrams with two baryons ( nucleons ) in the intermediate states , which can be simply understood as the second - order contributions in a series expansion of multi - meson exchanges . in this paper",
    "we calculate these two - meson - exchange ( tme ) potentials , using gaussian form factors , for the cases where one of the exchanged mesons is the pion . for exchanges with effective masses below 1 gev",
    "these are the most important ones .",
    "an extension to the most general two - meson exchange ( not necessarily involving at least one pion ) , can then be evaluated in a straight forward manner .",
    "furthermore , we restrict ourselves to the case with two nucleons in the intermediate states .",
    "the potentials containing the isobar excitation effects explicitly have been considered elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the second class consists of the diagrams where either one or both nucleons contains a pair vertex ( `` seagull '' diagrams ) .",
    "the pair - meson diagrams can be viewed as the result of integrating out the heavy - meson and resonance degrees of freedom in the two - meson - exchange processes ( see , e.g. , ref .",
    "it will appear that these `` seagull '' contributions can be interpreted successfully in a `` dual '' picture  @xcite .",
    "the various possibilities for meson pairs coupling to the nucleon are inspired by the chiral - invariant phenomenological lagrangians that have appeared in the literature .",
    "the pair - meson potentials belonging to this second class will be presented in the companion paper  @xcite .",
    "the mesons we include are ( i ) pseudoscalar mesons : @xmath4 , @xmath7 ; ( ii ) vector mesons : @xmath1 ; ( ii ) scalar mesons  @xcite : @xmath2 ; and ( iv ) the @xmath3 contribution from the pomeron . the @xmath8-exchange potential has already been derived in ref .",
    "@xcite , and we here only include those results for reasons of completeness . in the literature , the treatment of two - meson exchanges is incomplete .",
    "for example , the @xmath9 potential has been derived in the dispersion - relation approach  @xcite , which does not allow for the inclusion of gaussian form factors as applied in the present study . for the @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 exchanges , only the non - iterative potentials from the graphs with at least one meson in the intermediate state ( see below ) have been evaluated in momentum space in the framework of noncovariant perturbation theory  @xcite . in this paper",
    "we give , apart from the @xmath8-exchange , the potentials for all pion - meson exchanges with a total mass less than @xmath12 gev .",
    "our general approach to two - meson - exchange potentials is given , in principle , in ref .",
    "starting from the relativistic two - body equations , the two - meson - exchange potentials for the relativistic three - dimensional integral equation and for the lippmann - schwinger equation are derived from the second - order feynman diagrams by integration over the relative energies  @xcite .",
    "this way , the `` old - fashioned '' perturbation graphs for the tme potentials are obtained from the feynman diagrams .    the proper way to incorporate gaussian form factors",
    "is explained in @xcite and , as already mentioned above , in this paper the important `` factorization '' technique involving two mesons with different masses will be exploited .",
    "it is in particular this factorization technique which enables us to express the two - meson exchanges in terms of the basic coordinate - space function @xmath13 of the nijmegen one - boson - exchange ( obe ) model  @xcite .",
    "technically , there is no compelling reason to work in coordinate space , rather than in momentum space .",
    "electromagnetic effects can be included more easily in coordinate space , whereas relativistic effects can be studied more effectively in momentum space .",
    "however , we think that at low energies relativistic effects can be included sufficiently accurate in coordinate space .",
    "coordinate - space interactions are useful , for example , in jastrow variational calculations ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite ) or in applications where one wishes to distinguish a ( long - range ) meson - exchange region and a ( short - range ) quark - exchange region ( see , e.g. , refs .  @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , the effects of the particular shape of the central , spin - spin , tensor , and spin - orbit components on the phase shifts is much more transparent in a coordinate - space picture . ultimately , it is our goal to produce an @xmath14 potential which is exactly equivalent in both coordinate space and momentum space .",
    "the graphs which we calculate are : ( i ) the planar and crossed @xmath4-meson - exchange graphs of the similar type as those calculated by brueckner and watson  @xcite for two - pion exchange , and ( ii ) the iterated @xmath4-meson - exchange graphs of the type of graphs calculated by taketani , machida , and ohnuma  @xcite for two - pion exchange .",
    "as the distinction between these two classes of graphs is convenient as a means to denote the different contributions , we will also adopt in this paper the following nomenclature : the non - iterative potential graphs with at least one meson in the intermediate state are of class ( i ) and will be referred to as planar ( @xmath15 ) and crossed ( @xmath16 ) bw graphs , while the iterative graphs with only nucleons in the intermediate state are of class ( ii ) and will be referred to as tmo graphs .",
    "the @xmath4-meson - exchange potentials are calculated first using the adiabatic approximation for the nucleons in the intermediate states . however , in the meson exchanges we include the @xmath17 terms , in analogy with the obe model  @xcite .",
    "we find that up to this order the @xmath18 and @xmath19 potentials are identically zero .",
    "also , in the @xmath4-vector and @xmath4-pseudoscalar potentials there are large cancelations between the contributions from the planar and crossed - box diagrams when the meson is an isoscalar ( @xmath20 ) meson . therefore ,",
    "the next to leading order is expected to be important , and so we here also calculate the nonadiabatic @xmath5 corrections and the @xmath5 corrections from the pseudovector coupling of the pion and the other pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chap2 ] we define the two - meson - exchange kernels .",
    "we give the interaction hamiltonians and briefly indicate how the gaussian form factors can be implemented . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chap3 ] the definition of the nucleon - nucleon two - meson potential for the lippmann - schwinger equation is briefly repeated from @xcite and the vertices in pauli - spinor space for the different couplings are given .",
    "here we also mention the approximations made in these vertices . in the next section , the @xmath4-pseudoscalar , the @xmath4-scalar , the @xmath4-pomeron , and",
    "the @xmath4-vector potentials are derived . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chap5 ] we derive the @xmath5 corrections , due to ( i ) the nonadiabatic corrections , ( ii ) the @xmath5 term in the pseudovector coupling of the pion and the other pseudoscalar mesons , and ( iii ) a cancelation between the @xmath17 off - shell term in the pseudovector vertices and the @xmath5 term of the two - nucleon intermediate state in the tmo diagrams . in sec .",
    "[ sec : chap7 ] the results are shown and discussed .    appendix  [ app : appa ] contains a dictionary of differentiation formulas , adequate for deriving the final form of the potentials of this paper in coordinate space .",
    "explicit expressions for the leading - order contributions to the coordinate - space potentials are given in appendix  [ app : appb ] .",
    "the fourth - order two - meson - exchange kernel is derived following the procedure as discussed in @xcite , to which we refer for details and definitions .",
    "the only difference is that here we choose to shift the @xmath21 factors into the green s function .",

    "finally , we note that if we choose to take the pseudoscalar coupling ( [ lagps ] ) instead of the pseudovector coupling ( [ lagpv ] ) , there are some small differences in the pion - scalar and pion - vector potentials ; i.e. , one of the @xmath17 terms changes sign , see table  [ table2 ] .",
    "a much larger effect is due to the fact that in case of the pseudoscalar coupling the @xmath85 pseudovector - vertex corrections of sec .",
    "[ sec : chap5b ] are all absent .",
    "also , there is a sign change in the off - shell tmo corrections , which means that in the pion - pseudoscalar potential the nonadiabatic and off - shell tmo spin - orbit contributions exactly cancel ( they have the same @xmath205 dependence ) .",
    "hence , the apparent problem with the spin - orbit contribution as discussed above does not occur .",
