    "a wealth of theoretical evidence , mostly accumulated over the past decade , strongly suggests that the putative superfluid phase ( sfp ) of parahydrogen ( 2 ) , predicted over four decades ago,@xcite is unlikely to occur in practice .",
    "the problem with the original prediction is its failure to take into proper account the depth of the attractive well of the interaction potential between two 2 molecules , which imparts to the system a strong tendency to crystallize , even in reduced dimensions.@xcite if it occurs at all , superfluidity in 2 may only be observable in small clusters ( thirty molecules or less ) , @xcite which remain liquid - like at low temperature due to their relatively large surface to volume ratio .",
    "+ various theoretical and experimental avenues have been explored , aimed at suppressing crystallization in bulk 2 , thereby paving the way to a possible superfluid transition ; these have mainly attempted to exploit the ( combined ) effect(s ) of disorder , confinement , as well as the presence of external periodic potentials incommensurate with the preferred crystalline arrangement of 2 molecules in their equilibrium solid phase  all of these conditions are expected ( and in some cases have been shown ) to expand the region of stability of fluid phases , with respect to the bulk .",
    "+ however , although confinement and disorder are known to lead to novel phases of matter,@xcite and indeed there are theoretical predictions of enhanced superfluid response of 2 clusters in nanoscale size confinement,@xcite none of the above - mentioned attempts has so far yielded any evidence of fluid - like behaviour of 2 , much less superfluidity at low temperature ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "worth mentioning are , for instance , experimental studies of 2 in the confines of porous vycor,@xcite all showing that the system is in a crystalline phase at low @xmath1 , albeit with a different structure@xcite than that of bulk 2 .",
    "+ on the theoretical side , there is strong evidence that merely embedding a fluid of 2 molecules in a foreign crystalline matrix , incommensurate with the equilibrium crystal structure of pure 2 , does _ not _ result in a sfp.@xcite it really seems unlikely that one may arrive at 2 superfluidity in this way , as a low - density commensurate crystal is the only additional phase that can result from the presence of an external periodic potential .",
    "the same qualitative conclusion is reached even in the presence of a random distribution of scatterers.@xcite + a different kind of confinement , which has been long deemed favorable to the stabilization of novel phases of matter , consists of restricting particle motion to ( quasi ) one dimension ( 1d ) .",
    "this has motivated theoretical studies of quantum fluids such as @xmath2he@xcite and 2@xcite in strictly 1d , as well as in models of confinement aimed at describing the physical environment experienced by atoms and molecules moving inside a single carbon nanotube,@xcite or the interstitial channel of a bundle of nanotubes,@xcite or nanopores.@xcite + the low @xmath1 equilibrium properties of 2 confined in long , narrow ( around diameter ) cylindrical channels , which constitute a reasonably realistic model of a fluid of 2 molecules , e.g. , in the pores of glass like vycor , or even a carbon nanotube,@xcite have been recently studied systematically by first principle quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations.@xcite the main results of that study are that , on varying the attractive strength of the wall of the cylindrical pore , as well as its diameter , the equilibrium phase evolves from a single quasi - one - dimensional ( 1d ) channel along the axis , to a cylindrical crystalline shell , to the simultaneous presence of a crystalline shell coating the inner surface of the cylinder and a ( physically well separated ) quasi-1d axial column .",
    "+ all quasi-1d systems ( i.e. , the central column ) retain a strong propensity to crystallization , albeit somewhat reduced compared to the purely 1d system .",
    "this is in stark contrast to what is observed in confined @xmath2he @xcite ( due to its weaker inter - particle interactions ) .",
    "the results of ref . [ ] yield no evidence of a topologically protected superfluid phase , as described by the tomonaga - luttinger liquid theory ( tll ) .",
    "@xcite + almost concurrently , however , the claim was put forth [ m. rossi and f. ancilotto , phys .",
    "b * 94 * , 100502 ( 2016 ) , hereinafter referred to as ra ] of a quasi-1d superfluid phase of 2 , in a physical setting very similar to that considered in ref .",
    "[ ] , ostensibly based on comparable calculations .",
    "specifically , it is contended that inside a @xmath0 armchair carbon nanotube the equilibrium phase of an imbibed 2 fluid should consist of a ( solid ) cylindrical shell adsorbed on the surface of the tube , as well as an inner quasi-1d channel , which is quite consistent with the findings of ref .",
    "[ ] . however , it is concluded in ra that the quasi-1d axial 2 system displays superfluid character , in the tll sense .",
    "+ a key aspect is that in ra the full three dimensional ( 3d ) many - body hamiltonian , which includes interactions between 2 molecules as well as between 2 and the carbon atoms , is replaced with a purely 1d one , only aiming at describing 2 molecules along the axis .",
    "such a modified hamiltonian makes use of an effective renormalized pair - wise interaction among 2 molecules , given by : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a vector in cylindrical coordinates , @xmath5 is the radial particle number density , @xmath6 is the linear density for @xmath7 total 2 molecules inside a carbon nanotube of length @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the bare 2 intermolecular pair potential .",
    "it is important to note that , in ra , there is no cut - off in the radial integrations in ( [ eq : v1d ] ) , i.e. , they extend from the axis of the tube all the way to its surface , thereby including _ all _ the 2 molecules in the system .",
    "+ ra assert that the presence of the 2 shell adsorbed on the inner surface of the tube has the effect of dramatically weakening the effective pair - wise interaction among molecules in the quasi-1d central column .",
    "indeed , the effective pair potential @xmath10 arising from ( [ eq : v1d ] ) is strongly renormalized with respect to the bare pair potential . in particular",
    ", the depth of the attractive well of @xmath10 is about three times shallower than that of a typical , accepted 2 intermolecular potential , e.g. , the silvera - goldman .",
    "@xcite such an effective interaction is much more similar to that between two 4 atoms,@xcite and is therefore scarcely surprising that the 1d simulations carried out in ra , based on ( [ eq : v1d ] ) , find a strong propensity towards superfluidity ( again in the sense of tll theory ) , since this is consistent with 1d @xmath2he physics.@xcite    in this paper , we show that ( i ) @xmath10 does not provide a realistic ( much less _ ab initio _ ) model of intermolecular interactions in the central 1d column of 2 confined inside @xmath0 nanotubes and ( ii ) when performing an exact simulation of the full 3d microscopic system introduced by ra , we observe no evidence of superfluidity in the central column , but instead find a quasi - crystalline phase , undergoing spinodal decomposition below the 1d equibrium density of 2 , namely , @xmath11 .",
    "in other words , the physics of the axial 2 system rather closely reproduces the theoretical 1d limit .",
    "thus , contrary to what stated in ra , the confines of a carbon nanotube prove no more promising an environment for the stabilization of a superfluid phase of 2 than any of the ones that have been considered in the past .",
    "+ the remainder of this paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ mc ] we introduce a microscopic model of 2 confined inside a @xmath0 armchair carbon nanotube and provide computational details ; in sec .  [ sere ] we illustrate our results and offer a theoretical interpretation .",
    "finally , we outline our conclusions in sec .",
    "we considered a collection of @xmath7 point - like particles ( 2 molecules ) , moving in three dimensions in the presence of an external potential arising from a lattice of @xmath12 static , identical carbon atoms , aligned to form a section of length @xmath13 of a @xmath0 armchair nanotube of radius ( we neglect curvature as in ra).@xcite periodic boundary conditions are utilized in the axial direction , whereas in the other two they are immaterial as the system is confined .",
    "the quantum - mechanical many - body hamiltonian is : @xmath14 here , @xmath15 k@xmath16 , @xmath9 is the interaction potential between any two 2 molecules , @xcite only depending on their relative distance @xmath17 , whereas @xmath18 represents the interaction of each 2 molecule with a c atom.@xcite the above hamiltonian is identical to that reported in ra .",
    "it should be noted that refinements of @xmath9 have been recently proposed , which afford a more accurate reproduction of the experimental equation of state of 2 at high pressure,@xcite and that such potentials were used in the most recent studies of 2 in confinement.@xcite + we studied the low temperature physical properties of eq .",
    "( [ ham ] ) by means of first principle computer simulations based on the worm algorithm in the continuous - space path integral representation.@xcite the most important aspects of this well - established method to be emphasized here , are that it enables one to compute numerically exact thermodynamic properties of bose systems at finite temperature , directly from the microscopic hamiltonian , in particular energetic , structural and superfluid properties .",
    "+ technical details of the simulation are standard , and we refer the interested reader to ref . [ ] .",
    "we adopted the usual high - temperature approximation for the many - particle propagator accurate up to order @xmath19 , and all of the results reported here are extrapolated to the @xmath20 limit ; in general , we found that a value of the imaginary time step @xmath21 k@xmath22 yields estimates that are indistinguishable from the extrapolated ones , within the statistical errors of the calculation .",
    "we obtained results in the temperature range @xmath23 k @xmath24 k and observed no discernible variation of the physical behaviour .",
    "in particular , within this range of temperature , even the estimates of the energy remain unchanged within our statistical uncertainties ( @xmath25 0.01% on the total energy per 2 molecule ) .",
    "thus , the structural results presented here can be regarded as representative of the ground state of the system and can be directly compared with the @xmath26 results of ra .",
    "+ we point out that this study does not pose any particular challenges , as exchanges of indistinguishable particles are virtually absent in this system .",
    "the same results could in principle be obtained by means of a straightforward implementation of the path integral monte carlo methodology.@xcite",

    "all of these observations are consistent with the full simulations performed in ra .",
    "+ we observe sharper density features , with narrower peaks than those previously reported for 2 confined inside cylindrical pores of similar radii in weakly attractive substrates,@xcite as a result of the increased 2 density within the confines of a carbon nanotube , a strong adsorber .",
    "the enhanced molecular localization , and in particular the lack of any observed particle density between the central quasi-1d column and surrounding shell , and the ensuing absence of quantum exchanges , are _ not _ signatures of an energetically favorable environment for superfluidity.@xcite the lack of overlap between the wave function of molecules near the axis and those in the shell , renders these two systems _ de facto _ distinguishable , precluding the use of @xmath10 as given by ( [ eq : v1d ] ) , i.e. , without any cut - off beyond the axial core for the radial integrations .",
    "+ according to the tll theory , the ( quasi)superfluid character of a quasi-1d system can be inferred from the long - distance behaviour of the pair correlation function @xmath32 , which oscillates around unity , the amplitude of the oscillations decaying as @xmath33 as @xmath34 .",
    "the value of the luttinger parameter @xmath35 determines whether the system displays quasi - superfluid or quasi - crystalline behaviour . specifically , if @xmath36 the static structure factor will develop ( bragg ) peaks at reciprocal lattice vectors , which is the experimental signature of a crystalline solid . on the other hand ,",

    "+ the physical mechanism responsible for the reduction in @xmath35 is identical to that observed in ref . for 2 inside cylindrical channels in weak substrates .",
    "it arises from the effective softening of the repulsive core of the interaction between two 2 molecules moving on the axis , as a result of transverse zero - point excursions away from it ( the outer 2 shell plays no role ) .",

    "all of the subsequent results for the luttinger parameter @xmath35 reported in ra are based on this effective model , which is not proven to offer a quantitatively accurate description of molecular structure or energetics inside the nanotube .",
    "this is especially concerning , as interactions in their effective 1d model are _ strongly _ renormalized , featuring a much shallower attractive potential well ( about one third of that of the bare 2 potential ) .",
    "the resulting potential is very similar to the bare interaction between 4 atoms , but as the mass of bosonic 2 molecules is half that of 4 , it is not at all surprising that signatures of superfluidity are found in ra .",
    "additional claims of thermodynamically stable low density liquid phases are also in agreement with what is known to exist in 1d 4.@xcite        the effective potential utilized in by ra was previously discussed by one of us,@xcite in the context of the study of superfluid @xmath2he adsorbed inside cylindrical pores of nanometer size diameter .",
    "the considerably weaker _ bare _ potential between 4 atoms dramatically reduces the energy barrier for spatial fluctuations in the radial direction in that system and leads to enhanced atomic exchanges between the central column and surrounding cells .",
    "this is confirmed by the radial density profiles , which always exhibit a finite density of particles between shells , or by measuring the spatially resolved superfluid density@xcite which tracks the particle density . for 4 inside nanopores ,",
    "the wavefunction of atoms in the core penetrates far into the radial direction and @xmath10 may provide some qualitative insights into the origin of the reduction in @xmath35 from its known purely @xmath48 value .",
    "+ however , as seen in fig .",
    "[ f1 ] , 2 inside carbon nanotubes exhibits strong localization and molecules near the axis do not participate in any exchanges ( as evidenced by zero radial density between the column and first shell ) . in these conditions , one may only utilize eq .   by inserting a cutoff in the radial direction where the density vanishes ( @xmath49 in this case ) . to phrase it differently",
    ", the delocalization of molecules on the axis arises exclusively from zero point motion , and the outer 2 shell has no effect on the effective interaction between two molecules on the axis , contrary to what stated in ra .",

    "[ f4 ] , along with unrestricted integration employed by ra and the bare interaction potential.@xcite the resulting effective potential differs only minimally from the bare potential , and a 1d simulation employing it will exhibit none of the superfluid traits observed in ra using the ( spuriously ) weaker one ( line labelled  no cutoff \" in fig .",
    "+ summarizing , quantum monte carlo simulations of a realistic model of 2 in the confines of an armchair ( 10,10 ) carbon nanotube of radius @xmath25 6.7  , yield no evidence of possible superfluid behaviour . on the contrary , they display behavior that is consistent with previous work in similar settings ; the system has a strong propensity towards crystallization .",
