    "subdwarf b ( sdb ) stars are low - mass @xmath0 core helium burning objects with thin and mostly inert hydrogen - rich residual envelopes .",
    "they belong to the extreme horizontal branch ( ehb ) @xcite and remain hot @xmath1 and compact @xmath2 throughout their lifetime @xcite , before evolving towards the white dwarf cooling sequence without experiencing the asymptotic giant branch and planetary nebula phases of stellar evolution .",
    "@xcite use binary population synthesis calculations to demonstrate the formation of sdb stars through several possible channels , but resulting models require further comparison with observation . @xcite and @xcite respectively discovered that some sdb stars undergo fast and slow non - radial pulsations .",
    "this means asteroseismology can be used to study the internal structure of these stars and so constrain evolution models .    after having measuring the pulsation periods ,",
    "the first step of any seismic modelling is to identify the pulsation modes that are excited , mode identification consists in assigning values to the spherical wavenumbers @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , respectively the number of nodes of the radial displacement , the number of nodal lines on the stellar surface and the number of such lines passing through the rotation axis of the star . ] , which is far from being trivial .",
    "in the case of pulsating sdb stars , most mode identifications up to date have been performed using either period fitting ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* _ etc . _ ) or multicolour amplitude ratios ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* _ etc . _ ) .",
    "however , these methods do not provide a full reconstruction of the pulsations , and should therefore be complemented by spectroscopic mode identification techniques , such as the one we present here .",
    "as reported earlier @xcite , line - profile variations ( lpv ) , although weak , are to be expected in pulsating subdwarf - b stars .",
    "furthermore , they have been observed , for instance in pg  1325 + 101 by @xcite . a reliable spectroscopic mode identification method is therefore needed to take advantage of these and similar observations .",
    "nowadays , the most commonly used spectroscopic mode identification method is the `` moment method '' ( hereafter mm ) .",
    "it was first introduced by @xcite and later reformulated into computer - friendly terms and applied to main sequence pulsators by @xcite and @xcite for monoperiodic stars , while @xcite extended the formalism to multiperiodic stars . in this method ,",
    "one does not try to identify pulsation modes directly from the line - profiles , because this is often impossible for multiperiodic stars , but instead replaces each observed line - profile by its first few moments and compares their time dependence with that of theoretical moments .",
    "the latter depending on the wavenumbers @xmath4 and @xmath5 of the pulsation mode , as well as on the pulsation amplitude and on the inclination angle @xmath6 of the star , this method should in principle allow a complete reconstruction of any non - radial pulsation .",
    "it has been used successfully for the study of @xmath7 cephei and slowly pulsating b ( spb ) stars @xcite . however",
    ", this method makes use of a crucial ( and not always justified ) approximation : except for radial velocity variations , the mm neglects all other variations due to non - radial pulsations .    however , because of non - radial pulsations , different points on the stellar surface not only have different radial velocities , but also different temperatures , @xmath8 and orientations , and their contributions to a line - profile therefore have different amplitudes . hence , lpv do not only come from the doppler shift in wavelength , but also from the complex temperature and @xmath8 behavior on the stellar surface .",
    "this is especially the case in sdb pulsators : because they are so dense , any significant displacement of the stellar surface due to pulsation is kept at its minimum , and instead the available energy causes temperature perturbations in the stellar photosphere . to demonstrate that neglecting temperature , gravity and geometric variations can lead to a mistaken mode identification , even in the simplest cases",
    ", we used the mm to identify various monoperiodic pulsations present in time - series of synthetic spectra computed following @xcite . on the one hand",
    ", it could be seen that the mm always provide , within its five best solutions , the proper mode identification ( as well as very good estimates of @xmath6 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) when only radial velocity variations were taken into account .",
    "however , on the other hand , when temperature , gravity and geometric variations were taken into account ( as indeed they should be ) this test demonstrated that even in the simple case of monoperiodic pulsations , the current mm falls short of properly identifying all pulsational characteristics .",
    "clearly , in the case of pulsating sdb stars , where temperature , pressure and geometric effects have to be taken into account , an improved version of the moment method is needed .",
    "@xcite introduced a state - of - the - art code that computes times - series of synthetic spectra and lpv .",
    "the `` synthetic moment '' method ( hereafter smm ) introduced here takes advantage of this ability to compute `` synthetic moments '' for these extremely accurate synthetic lpv , and to compare them to observed moments : for a given target and observed line - profile variation , a grid of time - series of synthetic spectra spanning a suitable parameter space is computed , the first three moments of each of these synthetic lpv are obtained , and the best fit between observed and synthetic moments is found by minimising a merit function of the form @xmath11\\bigg\\}^{1/2}\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 is the number of observations , odd moments have average zero , and the synthetic second moment @xmath13 is adjusted to have the same average as its observed counterpart @xmath14 .    the choice of the parameter space to be searched is crucial : if too limited one might miss the proper mode identification , but if too broad the computing time of the synthetic lpv can become prohibitive .",
    "one could consider building an extensive grid of synthetic lpv by varying these parameters more or less `` continuously '' , but because most parameters are target - dependent , it is simply more efficient to compute one grid for each pulsating star",
    ". provided spectroscopic observations of the target are obtained at high enough snr , @xmath15 , @xmath8 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 $ ] can be determined to good accuracy . before attempting mode identification",
    ", one should also obtain reliable values of the pulsation period(s ) @xmath18 , either through ( ideally simultaneous ) photometry or radial velocity measurements . if the latter are obtained ( either directly through spectroscopic measurements or indirectly from the first moment ) , then good estimates of the physical velocity amplitudes of the pulsation mode(s )",
    "can be obtained ; if not , then pulsation amplitudes can in principle remain a free parameter , along with the inclination @xmath19 and the actual mode identification @xmath20 .",
    "ideally , when dealing with a multiperiodic star , all pulsation modes should be identified simultaneously , but this would require a very large grid of synthetic lpv , which can become prohibitive .",
    "it is however possible to attempt mode identification as follows :    1 .   use the smm on the dominant pulsation mode with a suitable primary grid of synthetic lpv to obtain @xmath21 and @xmath19 for the five best fitting solutions ( minimising @xmath22 ) . then , if at all possible , further discriminate between these five best solutions ( see next subsection for more details ) .",
    "each of the possible @xmath19 and @xmath21 combinations obtained in step 1 , build a secondary grid of synthetic lpv ( one for each @xmath23 combination ) and use the smm to identify the second pulsation mode .",
    "step 2 can be repeated at will until all modes have been succesfully identified .      as experience has shown in the case of main sequence pulsators (",
    "see for example @xcite ) it is in general safer not to accept straight away the best solution of the mm ( and by extension , of the smm ) as the proper mode identification , but instead to discriminate between a few best solutions using some other mode identification method . similarly , to confirm the identification of pulsation modes in pg1716 stars",
    ", we suggest a visual inspection of the fit between observed and synthetic moments , as well as the use of the ips ( for intensity period search ) diagnostic @xcite to compare the amplitude and phase diagrams of observed lpv with those of synthetic profiles corresponding to the few best solutions of the smm .",
    "figure [ synthlpv ] shows in grey - scale a biperiodic lpv , representative of the pg1716 star pg  1338 + 481 ( @xmath24k , @xmath25 , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 , [ he / h]@xmath29 , [ mg / h]@xmath30 ) , that was used ( amongst many others ) to test the smm .",
