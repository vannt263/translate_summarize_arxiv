    "in the search for a quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions , electromagnetic signals are considered good probes of the dense matter @xcite .",
    "because of the large electromagnetic mean free path , leptons and photons produced by interacting ( anti)quarks inside qgp can easily escape the hot and dense matter and carry the information of the system to the detector .",
    "recent developments in parton transport phenomenology indicate that dileptons and photons could also reveal the dynamics of the early evolution of the a dense parton system @xcite .",

    ", there are two kinds of background sources for the thermal electromagnetic signals .",
    "one comes from the evolution of the hadronic phase and the decays of the produced hadrons .",
    "the other one is due to the initial parton scatterings at the very earliest stage of the heavy ion collisions . for dilepton production , the latter one is usually referred to as drell - yan ( dy ) processes @xcite .",
    "in the lowest order , @xmath4 , the dy processes are simply quark - antiquark annihilations .",
    "first order contributions @xmath5 in perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) , originating from initial state radiation and virtual corrections , give rise to about the same amount of dilepton production as in the lowest order , which is often characterized by a so - called `` @xmath6-factor '' of about 2 @xcite .",

    "it is expected that at energies @xmath9 agev , minijets [ ( anti)quarks and gluons with @xmath10 few gev / c ] are produced abundantly via multiple semihard scatterings .",
    "these minijets have important contributions to particle production , transverse energy and overall evolution of the formed quark - gluon system @xcite-@xcite .",
    "therefore , it would be interesting to study dilepton bremsstrahlung from the initially produced minijets .",

    "@xcite , the relatively large invariant masses @xmath12 of the dileptons fix the lower limit of the momentum scale of the qcd radiation processes .",
    "this makes the problem calculable in pqcd . in the leading logarithm approximation and in an axial gauge @xcite",
    ", the dilepton fragmentation functions can be calculated up to all orders in pqcd .",
    "using the obtained fragmentation functions to convolute with minijet cross sections , we then compute the contribution to the dilepton production from the final state radiation of minijets .",
    "we will show how the associated production of @xmath13 gev / c@xmath2 dileptons from minijets with @xmath14 gev / c is comparable to the first order dy results at bnl relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) energies but becomes dominant at cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) energies , even up to masses @xmath15 gev / c@xmath2 .",

    "[ eq : dq03 ] and [ eq : dq11 ] , we can see that the relative importance of the first order qcd correction to the qed fragmentation function is controlled by a @xmath19-dependent factor , @xmath48 where @xmath49 is defined in eq .",

    "the only difference is that dilepton ( or virtual photon ) fragmentation functions with a given mass @xmath20 have a definite initial condition , @xmath68 together with the boundary condition , @xmath69 the boundary condition simply means that the probability for the dilepton to take the whole fraction of momentum of the initial quark or gluon is zero after qcd evolution is taken into account . since there is always a finite contribution to @xmath70 from the qed term in the evolution equation eq .",

    "the overall qcd corrections to the qed ( or lowest order in pqcd ) result are about 10% , except near @xmath79 and 1 .",
    "since a gluon does not have dilepton production to the zeroth order in pqcd , the dilepton fragmentation function of a gluon is one order of magnitude smaller than a quark . because there are logarithmic divergences at @xmath79 and 1 for each order correction to the dilepton fragmentation functions , as can be seen in eqs .",
    "[ eq : qz1 ] and [ eq : gz1 ] , every order becomes important so that one has to sum them together to get the full qcd result .",

    "although not shown here , this can be done analytically for the first order calculation of the dilepton fragmentation functions .",
    "one could also use the relative transverse momentum @xmath84 as the argument in the running strong coupling constant .",
    "this is , however , beyond the scope of our simple leading logarithm estimates in this paper .    with the kinematical cutoff in eq .",
    "[ eq : z0 ] , we can obtain the integrated dilepton fragmentation functions , @xmath85 , the probabilities for a quark or gluon to produce a dilepton with mass @xmath20 within the interval @xmath86 .",

    "the first order results @xmath90 and @xmath91 are very close to the full qcd - evolved fragmentation functions with only a few percent difference through the whole @xmath51 range . as we have seen in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the full qcd - evolved fragmentation functions are enhanced at small @xmath16 while depleted at large @xmath16 as compared to the lowest order calculations . for small values of @xmath92 ,",
    "qcd evolution is important , but the lower limit @xmath93 of the @xmath16-integration is also small .",
    "thus , the integrated full qcd fragmentation functions are almost the same as the first order results . at large values of @xmath92 ,",
    "the lower limit @xmath93 is large , but the qcd corrections in any order are increasingly smaller .",
    "therefore , in the whole range of @xmath51 , the first order calculation of the @xmath16-integrated dilepton fragmentation functions is a very good approximation .      in the following ,",
    "we consider dilepton production associated with minijets .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the differential rates of dileptons with rapidity @xmath94 as functions of the invariant mass @xmath20 . as a first approximation , we can assume the dilepton to be produced collinearly with the parent quark or gluon .",
    "then the differential cross section can be written down in a straightforward manner by folding the @xmath16-integrated dilepton fragmentation functions @xmath95 and @xmath96 with the @xmath97 subprocesses of minijet production .",
    "we can also neglect the contribution from the initial state dilepton radiation , since the rapidities of these pairs are typically large like those of the initially radiated partons @xcite .",
    "one has to take into account that the dilepton pair can be produced by either one of the final state partons , and connect this to the correct normalization of the integrated minijet cross section @xmath98 . in this way ,",
    "the basic formula for the associated production of dileptons with @xmath99 from minijets in a @xmath100 collision at impact parameter @xmath101 can be written as follows : @xmath102 where the produced ( anti)quarks and gluons ( i.e. minijets ) have transverse momentum @xmath103 and the kinematical range of rapidities @xmath104 the momentum fractions of the initial state partons are denoted by @xmath105 and the mandelstam variables in the parton - parton level for the massless partons by @xmath106 the cross sections @xmath107 for the various partonic subprocesses can be found e.g. in refs .",
    "the parton density of a nucleus by our definition is @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the thickness function of the nucleus which is normalized to @xmath110 .",
    "the parton distribution in a nucleon is @xmath111 , and the ratio @xmath112 for the nuclear modifications to the parton distributions is both scale and impact parameter dependent @xcite . in the following , we will approximate the impact parameter dependent ratio @xmath112 by its averaged value , @xmath113 so that @xmath114 where the effective parton distributions per nucleon in a nucleus is defined as @xmath115    in this paper we will use the set 1 of the duke - owens parton distributions @xcite for @xmath111 .",
    "we use the scale dependent nuclear modifications for @xmath116 as studied in @xcite .",
    "especially , we assume that at the lowest scale @xmath117 gev , gluons are shadowed by the same amount as the structure function @xmath118 in deeply inelastic @xmath119 scatterings .",
    "note that the normalization of eq .",
    "[ mini ] can be checked by setting the @xmath51-integrated fragmentation functions to unity and integrating over @xmath120 ; this will give us @xmath121 as expected when integrating over the inclusive @xmath97 scattering cross section .",
    "as usually in the case of pqcd calculations , there are uncertainties in choosing the momentum scales both in the parton distributions and the fragmentation functions .",
    "we will choose the scale entering the parton distributions to be the transverse momentum of the jets , @xmath122 , for duke - owens parametrization set 1 with @xmath123 gev @xcite .",
    "the scale @xmath124 in the dilepton fragmentation functions represents the maximum virtuality of the final state parton before any radiation .",
    "as we have emphasized in this paper , the dilepton fragmentation functions at large fixed mass do not have nonperturbative contributions .",
    "therefore , unlike the scale in the parton distributions , @xmath125 in large mass dilepton fragmentation functions is not correlated with the choice of @xmath126 .",
    "examining the matrix elements of @xmath127 processes , one can find out that the scale entering the leading logarithm term is one of the mandelstam variables , @xmath128 , depending on the channel of the specific process .",

    "it is also straightforward to calculate the @xmath7 distribution of the associated dilepton pairs in our fragmentation function approach . since one has to convolute the dilepton fragmentation functions in @xmath16 together with the @xmath7 distributions of the jets , we expect the resultant @xmath7 spectrum of these dileptons to be softer than the @xmath7 spectrum of the jets",
    "therefore , the dileptons associated with minijets should have smaller @xmath7 relative to the direct drell - yan pairs which have a high @xmath7 tail like that of the produced jets .",
    "since thermally produced dileptons in a qgp also have relatively small @xmath7 as compared to drell - yan @xcite , minijet - associated dileptons thus pose a more intangible background .",
    "in calculating the dilepton fragmentation functions , we have assumed leading logarithm approximation so that we can include contributions from all orders in pqcd .",
    "however , the higher order corrections are small and the first order results are sufficient enough for our estimates of the minijet - associated dilepton production .",
    "the largest uncertainty in our calculation is the choice of the momentum scale @xmath125 used in the dilepton fragmentation functions .",
    "since the correct scale in a matrix element calculation is channel - dependent , we used only an effective scale choice in the fragmentation functions to convolute with the minijet cross sections .",
    "we evaluated the dilepton spectrum for two choices of the scale , @xmath139 , @xmath156 .",
    "however , the results with @xmath139 should give us the lower bound of the associated dilepton production .",
    "another notorious uncertainty of the @xmath7 cutoff @xmath130 in minijet - related problems is greatly reduced here due to the kinematic restriction @xmath158 . for @xmath139 ,",
    "the @xmath7 cutoff is replaced by @xmath20 whenever @xmath20 is larger than @xmath130 .",
    "the abundance of dileptons associated with minijet production at high energies is mainly due to the large gluon - related minijet cross sections and the high initial gluon densities inside the colliding nuclei .",
    "this should have important implications for the dilepton production in the pre - equilibrium stage of the quark gluon plasma .",
    "as pointed out recently @xcite , the parton system is not at all in chemical equilibrium when initially produced in the earliest stage of high energy nucleus - nucleus collisions . because of the small cross sections for ( anti)quark production , the initial parton system is dominated by gluons and is quark deficient as compared to an equilibrated qgp .",
    "studies @xcite also suggest that the parton system thus produced may not be able to achieve chemical equilibrium before hadronization . in this case",
    ", dilepton production through @xmath167 annihilation should be severely suppressed . on the contrary",
    ", dilepton production from gluon fragmentation could become relatively important for a gluon dominated system , since gluon - related cross sections of small angle scatterings are about 9/4 larger than the quark . even though the dilepton fragmentation function of a gluon is about one order of magnitude smaller than a quark , a gluon density at least about 5 times higher than the quark could easily compensate the small fragmentation function and make the gluon associated dilepton production important .",
