    "first observe that an @xmath5-perfect code in @xmath290 would induce a tiling of @xmath292 by @xmath291 , and a _ packing _ by @xmath295 .",
    "the relative efficiency of the latter with respect to the former is defined as the ratio of the volumes of these bodies , @xmath312 , which by lemma [ th : volumes ] tends to @xmath3 as @xmath5 grows indefinitely .",
    "this has the following consequence : if an @xmath5-perfect code exists in @xmath75 for arbitrarily large @xmath5 , then there exists a tiling of @xmath292 by translates of the body @xmath291 for arbitrarily large @xmath5 , which further implies that a packing of @xmath292 by translates of the body @xmath295 exists which has efficiency arbitrarily close to @xmath3 .",

    "i.e. , a tiling ( in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix ) it is shown that there exists a packing whose density is the supremum of the densities of all possible packings with a given body ) .",
    "this is a contradiction .",
    "namely , minkowski @xcite ( see also ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 1 ) ) has shown that a necessary condition for a convex body to be able to tile space is that it be a polytope with centrally symmetric is centrally symmetric if its translation @xmath313 satisfies @xmath314 for some @xmath315 . ]",
    "facets , which @xmath295 fails to satisfy for @xmath310 .",
    "for example , the facet which is the intersection of @xmath295 with the hyperplane @xmath316 is the simplex @xmath317 , a non - centrally - symmetric body .    in summary , we have shown that linear @xmath5-perfect codes in @xmath74 exist for :    * @xmath318 , @xmath5 arbitrary , * @xmath310 a prime power , @xmath319 .",
    "the statement that these are the only cases ( apart from the trivial one @xmath320 ) , even if nonlinear codes are allowed , is a further strengthening of the prime power conjecture .",
    "it should also be contrasted with the golomb - welch conjecture @xcite ( see also , e.g. , @xcite ) stating that @xmath5-perfect codes in @xmath70 under @xmath46 distance exist only in the following cases :    @xmath318 , @xmath5 arbitrary , and    @xmath319 , @xmath21 arbitrary .    to conclude this section we note that one could also define perfect @xmath6 sequences as those that give rise to tilings by the shapes @xmath321 . in dimension",
    "@xmath3 the problem is trivial , and in dimension @xmath287 the tilings exist for any @xmath322 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : s2_tiling ] ) .",
    "the tiling lattice @xmath121 for the shape @xmath323 is the one spanned by the vectors @xmath324 and @xmath325 , and it is unique , which can be seen from the figure . in this case",
    ", however , @xmath238 is not cyclic and hence , perfect @xmath6 sequences of size @xmath326 do not exist in cyclic groups . in higher dimensions ,",
    "a statement analogous to theorem [ th : rperfect ] can be proven to exclude such tilings for @xmath5 large enough .",

    "a permutation channel @xcite over an alphabet @xmath181 is a communication channel that takes sequences of symbols from @xmath181 as inputs , and for any input sequence outputs a random permutation of this sequence .",
    "this channel is intended to model packet networks based on routing in which the receiver can not rely on the packets being delivered in any particular order , as well as several other communication scenarios where a similar effect occurs , such as systems for distributed storage , data gathering in wireless sensor networks , etc .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the appropriate space for defining error - correcting codes for such channels is @xmath328 , where @xmath329 is the discrete standard simplex , and @xmath53 is the metric given by .",
    "notice that @xmath330 is just the translated @xmath2 lattice restricted to the nonnegative orthant .",
    "this restriction is the reason that this space lacks some nice properties that are usually exploited when studying bounds on codes , packing problems , and the like . in order to study the underlying geometric problem",
    ", one can disregard these restrictions and investigate the corresponding problems in @xmath74 .",
    "the same approach is employed for some other types of codes ; for example , studying the geometry of codes for flash memories reduces to packing problems in @xmath70 , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "observe the channel with input alphabet @xmath331 in which the transmitted symbols can be increased , decreased , or remain intact ( we are not concerned here with a detailed description of the channel , but wish to make a rather general point ) . in some situations",
    ", it may be desirable to treat these two types of errors separately when designing an error - correcting code , and to impose different bounds on the number of `` up '' and `` down '' errors that can be corrected .",
    "this is because these types of errors can be of different nature and/or different origin , and the probabilities of a symbol being increased / decreased might be different .",
    "we give below two simple examples , see also @xcite for a survey of codes for the classical @xmath332-ary asymmetric channel .",
    "consider the following channel model .",
    "the transmitter sends @xmath333 particles ( or packets ) in the @xmath63th time slot .",
    "the particles are assumed identical , implying that the transmitted sequence can be identified with a sequence of nonnegative integers @xmath334 . in the channel ,",
    "some of the particles can be lost ( deletions ) , while new particles can appear from the surrounding medium ( insertions ) .",
    "additionally , one can also allow delays of the particles in the model @xcite .",
    "( notice that if a particle is delayed , this can be thought of as it being deleted , while another particle is being inserted several time slots later . )",
    "such channels are of interest in molecular communications , discrete - time queuing systems , etc .",
    "we want to guarantee that all patterns of @xmath335 insertions and @xmath336 deletions can be corrected at the receiving side .",
    "it is not difficult to see that this will be achieved if and only if the translates of the set @xmath93 are disjoint . in other words ,",
    "the decoding regions are in this case defined precisely by the set @xmath88 , and hence , packing / tiling problems in @xmath75 are relevant for studying and designing good codes for channels of this type .      as a different scenario ,",
    "think of the symbols in @xmath181 as voltage levels ( e.g. , in baseband digital signal transmission , or in multi - level flash memory @xcite ) , and suppose that we wish to assure that the receiver will be able to recover the signal whenever the total voltage drop ( across all symbols of a particular codeword ) caused by noise is @xmath336 , and the total voltage increase @xmath335 .",
    "this situation is essentially identical to the one in the previous example , and it is clear that the codes in @xmath75 ( more precisely their restrictions to @xmath337 ) are adequate constructions for error - correction in this case .",
