    "the special electronic structure of graphene shows up in its electronic properties . @xcite",
    "most attention has been paid to the electronic conductivity @xcite which , due to the strong energy dependence of the density of states , can be tuned significantly with a gate voltage . for dirty graphene",
    ", this gate dependence is furthermore modified by elastic scattering @xcite due to potential inhomogenities forming charge puddles . at high voltages , also inelastic scattering due to optical phonons appears @xcite , but the low - energy inelastic scattering due to electron - electron ( e - e ) @xcite or electron- acoustic phonon scattering ( e - ph ) @xcite does not directly influence the conductivity because the mean free paths for them are typically larger than the elastic mean free path .",
    "@xcite    in this paper we study the effect of low - energy inelastic scattering in graphene by using josephson critical current measurements to determine heat transport in the system .",
    "the idea is to apply a heater voltage and to measure the increased temperature via nearby thermometers .",
    "the measurement is performed at sub - kelvin temperatures and low voltages , thereby providing access to low - energy inelastic scattering processes and allowing to disregard scattering from optical phonons . to perform the measurement we use three superconducting electrodes fabricated on graphene .",
    "two of them ( thermometer electrodes , c and r in fig .  [",
    "fig : set ] ) lie close to each other , so that we can measure a finite supercurrent through them , and the third one ( heater electrode , l in fig .",
    "[ fig : set ] ) is used for heating the system .",
    "the supercurrent is sensitive to the electron temperature or , more accurately , to the electron distribution function on the graphene region between the superconductors @xcite and therefore acts as an electron thermometer .",
    "k. ]    we make two measurements : first we measure the supercurrent as a function of temperature , and thus calibrate the thermometer and find parameters for a microscopic theory describing the supercurrent in the junction .",
    "second , we apply a voltage to the heater electrode , supplying heat into the electron system , and measure again the supercurrent in the presence of the heater voltage .",
    "the magnitude of the supercurrent in the presence of the heater voltage is sensitive to the strength of inelastic relaxation inside graphene , allowing us to measure it .    the joule heat generated in the presence of a bias voltage",
    "is dissipated either to the electrodes or to phonons.@xcite however , since the electron - acoustic phonon coupling is so weak in graphene , most of the heat escapes into the electrodes , even though this process is blocked at low energies by the superconducting gap @xmath2 .",
    "the escape is possible as a result of processes transferring excitations from low energies to above the gap , in particular multiple andreev reflections @xcite and e - e scattering .",
    "the former tends to broaden the electron distribution below the gap and thus to increase the effective temperature at these energies , while the latter drives the distribution towards a quasiequilibrium ( fermi function ) form having a lower effective temperature .",
    "our thermometer is most sensitive to the distribution at energies below @xmath2 , and therefore it is a sensitive probe of the e - e scattering strength in graphene . but to extract the magnitude of the e - e scattering we have to abandon the simple effective temperature description used for example in ref .   and rather solve a full kinetic boltzmann equation , with e - e scattering included explicitly with a collision integral .",

    "physically , we assume that the superconductor on top of the graphene flake acts as an electrode for the high - energy electrons and does not noticeably affect the low - energy ones .",
    "we also assume above and in the following that @xmath2 is constant : independent of position or heating in the system .",
    "the degree of inelastic scattering determines the state of the system which , in the presence of superconductors , can become a quite complicated nonequilibrium state when e - e relaxation is incomplete .",

    "the use of a semiclassical diffusion approach has some limitations for the description of graphene , however .",
    "the experimentally found finite minimal conductivity at the cnp can not be explained without quantum - mechanical effects and a more detailed description of the impurities and the nonuniform doping effects they may introduce ( charge puddles ) .",

    "we assume the distribution @xmath44 is sufficiently well defined by the effective electron temperature @xmath70 of eq .  .",
    "then , in the limit @xmath84 , where @xmath85 is the sound velocity , the e - ph power is @xmath86 with a @xmath4-dependent interaction constant @xmath87 and the area of the flake @xmath88 .",
    "this power law is applicable up to very close to the dirac point since the condition @xmath89 translates to @xmath90 for the distance from the dirac point in terms of gate voltage @xmath91 .",

    "this estimate neglects the effect of charge puddles close to the cnp , but we expect eq .",
    "to hold whenever the use of our semiclassical approach is justified .    the total power injected into the system is @xmath99 and if electron - phonon coupling is absent , all of this escapes into the leads . if , furthermore , e - e interactions are neglected , the electron distribution function is comprised of discrete steps due to multiple andreev reflections @xcite so that highest local effective temperature of the system is roughly @xmath100 . @xcite as a result , energy escape takes place also at @xmath101 . in the presence of e - e interactions",
    ", @xmath70 is reduced from this value so that for strong interactions , @xmath102 as in a diffusive conductor without superconductivity ( notice that , at high voltages , a hot spot is formed in the middle of the normal - conducting region 1 , so that @xmath103 becomes high while the average @xmath70 remains much lower ) .",
    "for @xmath104 @xmath105 and we see that the relative importance of e - ph interaction increases in two cases : first with increasing @xmath106 and second with @xmath106 decreasing below @xmath2 when e - e interaction is absent .",
    "we evaluate the both possibilities to obtain a range for @xmath106 where @xmath107 is significant .    the value for the e - ph interaction constant has not been measured but we obtain a theoretical upper estimate @xmath108  w / k@xmath109m@xmath110 for graphene mass density @xmath111",

    "we emphasize that in this estimate we used the hot - spot temperature which is much larger than the average @xmath70 at high voltages . on the other hand , at low voltages , we assumed a total absence of e - e interaction resulting in a high @xmath70 of the order @xmath2 .",
    "generally , @xmath70 can be expected to be even smaller than estimated above and we conclude that for our experiment e - ph coupling can be neglected .",
    "coulomb interactions in graphene have been discussed , for example , in refs .",
    "however , most of the existing results are for clean , charge - neutral graphene , where the golden - rule collision integrals are furthermore plaqued by divergences.@xcite a full theory of e - e interactions for diffusive graphene that would be valid at both the dirac point and at finite doping is currently lacking . in particular it is not known if a well - defined quasiequilibrium state ever exists in diffusive graphene biased far from equilibrium , although it is often a convenient assumption.@xcite since the interband relaxation due to e - e collisions is expected to be weak,@xcite electrons and holes ( or electrons in the conduction and valence bands ) may in any case have to be treated separately.@xcite    as explained above , our semiclassical approach restricts our calculation in principle to the strongly - doped regime , where only one charge carrier is dominant . in this case",

    "in our theoretical model based on metallic e - e interaction , gate voltage has no explicit effect on the results and any gate dependence is due only to such dependence in the materials parameters such as @xmath23 .",
    "we therefore use the parameter values from the case where @xmath154  v as a representative example .",
    "in addition , we set @xmath190 so that any pecularities due to the nonequilibrium state should be visible both in region 1 and 2 . a true nonequilibrium distribution with @xmath191 is given in fig .",
    "[ fig : f0 ] and we notice that , in the absence of relaxation , @xmath44 remains constant in region 2 .",
    "this happens because the electrostatic potential at the middle superconductor is fixed .",
    "the numerically determined @xmath44 for @xmath192 ( table  [ table : kee ] ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : f1 ] .",
    "we see that while the electrons clearly have a nonequilibrium distribution near the superconductors , where @xmath44 in any case is strongly affected by the boundary conditions of eqs .   and  , in the middle of both regions 1 and 2 @xmath44 is smoothed very close to a thermal distribution .",
    "the question now regarding the state of the system is : is @xmath44 in region 2 effectively a thermal ( quasi)equilibrium distribution ?",
    "if so , the e - e interaction is weak enough to let some of the energy injected into region 1 leak into region 2 , but still so strong that it forces the system in region 2 into a thermal state . to answer this",
    ", we calculate @xmath24 as a function of heater voltage for several values of @xmath142 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ktestic ] .",
    "first , the expected value of supercurrent is clearly dependent on the value of @xmath142 in this range so the measurement can be used to determine @xmath142 with satisfactory precision .",
    "second , as there is no plateau of constant @xmath24 at small voltages , the system is only in complete equilibrium state at @xmath74 .",
    "third , at voltages @xmath193 there is a clear difference between the critical current obtained using actual nonequilibrium distributions and their quasiequilibrium counterparts , i.e. ,  equilibrium functions @xmath67 with @xmath70 determined from @xmath44 .",
    "this implies that not only electron heating but also the formation of nonequilibrium state affects the observable supercurrent at @xmath193 . for voltages smaller than this",
    ", a quasiequilibrium description for the system is apt .",
    "for a representative case ( @xmath154  v , @xmath190 ) at different positions of the graphene flake . here ,",
    "e - e interactions are neglected , i.e. ,  @xmath191 .",
    "dashed line is the quasiequilibrium function @xmath67 at the effective temperature @xmath70 corresponding to the nonequilibrium function @xmath44 . ]     for a representative case ( @xmath154  v , @xmath190 ) at different positions of the graphene flake . here",
    ", the strength of the e - e interaction corresponds to the value of table  [ table : kee ] which we obtained by fitting to the experimental data : @xmath192 .",
    "dashed line is the quasiequilibrium function @xmath67 at the effective temperature @xmath70 corresponding to the nonequilibrium function @xmath44 . the spectral supercurrent @xmath194 ( eq .  ) is shown as a black dotted line with arbitrary units and centered so that @xmath195 when @xmath196 . ]    .",
    "the solid lines are the results from the nonequilibrium distributions @xmath44 , whereas the dashed lines demonstrate how @xmath24 differs if quasiequilibrium functions with effective electron temperatures are used instead .",
    "blue crosses correspond to the measured values . ]",
    "we finally estimate the e - e relaxation time in our sample . from eq .  , we find @xmath197  ns at @xmath198  mk and @xmath199  ps at @xmath200  k , depending on the gate voltage .",
    "the relaxation rate is expected to be proportional to the electron - electron scatterin strength @xmath142 .",
    "our measurements therefore suggest e - e relaxation times which are smaller than the values above by a factor @xmath201 .",
    "then , at @xmath202 , @xmath203  ps and @xmath200  k , @xmath204  ps .",
    "we are not aware of any comparable results in the low - energy regime .",
    "the e - e scattering times have been estimated for graphene in ref .  , but there the graphene is ballistic , the energy scale much larger and the obtained scattering times , consequently , ( even ) much smaller .",
    "we have measured the strength of e - e interaction in graphene at four different gate voltages . from eq .",
    "we find the expected values for the parameter @xmath142 describing the interaction strength as given in table  [ table : kee ] .",
    "the measured values are roughly 40 - 140 times larger than expected from the altshuler - aronov theory with the largest differences closer to the dirac point .",
    "discrepancies between theory and experiments are reported also in metallic wires ( ag ) , @xcite but there the differences are sample - specific and only up to a factor of 20 , with the measured value larger there as well . even though the strength of the e - e interaction is stronger than expected , the system is still not thermalized and the incomplete e - e relaxation can be seen at heater voltages @xmath71 well below the superconducting gap by measuring the critical current .",
    "the result at low voltages is seen as an energy leak from the heater junction and increasing temperature in the thermometer region . for @xmath205 ,",
    "also the electrons in the thermometer are driven into a nonequilibrium state where a thermal description with an effective temperature @xmath70 is no longer enough .",
    "in addition to finding the magnitude of the e - e scattering strength , we find that the scattering strength exhibits a significant gate dependence , presumably due to changes in charge density as the gate voltage is varied .",
    "finally , we note that we have also estimated the interaction strength between electrons and acoustic phonos in our setup with an aim to measure it .",
    "however , since the e - e interaction is relatively strong , we expect that @xmath70 is at most of the order of the heater voltage except when @xmath101 .",
    "consequently , the expected electron - phonon power at @xmath206 becomes even lower than predicted by our estimate in sec .",
    "[ sec : e - ph ] . at the other end of the scale , @xmath205",
    ", the effective temperature needs to be increased yet further for a high ratio @xmath207 .",
    "this results in notable heating also in the thermometer region , making a critical current measurement such as the one used here very difficult , unless a strong thermal isolation is established between the heater and the thermometer regions .",
