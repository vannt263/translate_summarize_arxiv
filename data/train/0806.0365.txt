    "it is known that the model undergoes a delocalization transition : if the asymmetry parameter exceeds a critical value @xmath19 then the fraction of `` monomers '' @xmath20 , @xmath21 , which are in the upper half - plane tends to @xmath0 in the thermodynamic limit @xmath22 ( delocalized phase ) , while if @xmath23 then a non - zero fraction of them is in the lower half - plane ( localized phase ) .",
    "what mostly attracts attention is the slope , call it @xmath24 , of the curve @xmath25 in the limit @xmath26 : @xmath24 is expected to be a universal quantity , i.e. , independent of the details of the law @xmath4 and of the disorder distribution ( see next section for a more extended discussion on this point ) .",
    "already the fact that the limit slope is well - defined and positive is highly non - trivial @xcite .    until now , all what was known rigorously about @xmath24 is that @xmath27 , but numerically the true value seems to be rather around @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the upper bound comes simply from annealing , i.e. , from jensen s inequality , as explained in next section .",
    "our main new result is that @xmath24 is strictly smaller than @xmath0 .",
    "the proof works through a coarse - graining procedure in which one looks at the system on the length - scale @xmath29 , given by the inverse of the annealed free energy .",
    "the other essential ingredient is a change - of - measure idea to estimate fractional moments of the partition function ( this idea was developed in @xcite and @xcite , and used in the context of copolymers in @xcite ) .",
    "coarse - graining schemes , implemented in a way very different from ours , have already played an important role in this and related polymer models ; we mention in particular @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",

    "as already mentioned , much attention has been devoted to the slope of the critical curve at the origin , in short the `` critical slope '' , @xmath82 existence of such limit is not at all obvious ( and indeed was proven @xcite only in the case of the `` standard copolymer model '' ) , but is expected to hold in general .",
    "while the proof in @xcite was given in the case @xmath83 , it was shown in @xcite ( by a much softer argument ) that the results of @xcite imply ( always for the model ) that the slope exists and is the same in the gaussian case we are considering here . moreover , the critical slope is expected to be a function only of @xmath84 and not of the full @xmath37 , at least for @xmath85 , and to be independent of the choice of the disorder law @xmath44 , as long as the @xmath17 s are iid , with finite exponential moments , centered and of variance @xmath0 .",
    "in contrast , it is known that the critical curve @xmath25 _ does _ in general depend on the details of @xmath37 ( this follows from ( * ? ? ? * prop .",
    "2.11 ) ) and of course on the disorder law @xmath44 .",
    "the belief in the _ universality of the critical slope _ is supported by the result of @xcite which , beyond proving that the limit exists , identifies it with the critical slope of a continuous copolymer model , where the simple random walk @xmath58 is replaced by a brownian motion , and the @xmath17 s by a white noise .    until recently , nothing was known about the value of the critical slope , except for @xmath86 which follows from and from the lower bound in ( note that the strict upper bound does not imply a strict upper bound on the slope ) .",
    "none of these bounds is believed to be optimal .",
    "in particular , as we mentioned in the introduction , for the standard copolymer model numerical simulations @xcite suggest a value around @xmath28 for the slope . this situation was much improved in @xcite : if @xmath87 , then ( * ? ? ? * ths .",
    "2.9 and 2.10 ) @xmath88 note that @xmath87 and @xmath89 are profoundly different situations : the inter - arrival times of the renewal process have finite mean in the former case and infinite mean in the latter .",
    "moreover , it was proven in ( * ? ? ?",

    "our main result is that the upper bound in is always strict :    [ th : slope ] for every @xmath39 there exists @xmath94 such that , whenever @xmath37 satisfies , @xmath95    it is interesting to note that the upper bound depends only on the exponent @xmath84 and not the details of @xmath37 .",
    "this is coherent with the mentioned belief in universality of the slope .",
    "the new idea which allows to go beyond the results of ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.10 ) is to bound above the fractional moments of @xmath96 in two steps :    1 .",
    "first we chop the system into blocks of size @xmath97 , the correlation length of the annealed model , and we decompose @xmath96 according to which of the blocks contain points of @xmath63 2 .   only at that point we apply the inequality , where each of the @xmath98 corresponds to one of the pieces into which the partition function has been decomposed .",
    "theorem [ th : slope ] holds in the more general situation where @xmath46 is a sequence of iid random variables with finite exponential moments and normalized so that @xmath99 .",
    "we state the result and give the proof only in the gaussian case simply to keep technicalities at a minimum . the extension to the general disorder law",
    "can be obtained following the lines of ( * ? ? ?",
