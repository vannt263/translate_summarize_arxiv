    "<S> we propose a set theoretical foundation including an axiom of constructibility and derive a generalized quantum mechanics by postulating symmetry of action . </S>",

    "<S> quantum mechanics is obtained here without the requirement for presupposing the statistical interpretation of the wave function ; thus this derivation becomes continuous with prior physics . </S>",
    "<S> in this theory we also see space - time as relational and the fields as free of singularities .    </S>",
    "<S> we propose the following axioms . </S>",
    "<S> the formulae for these axioms are given in the appendix .    </S>",
    "<S> .[tbl - axioms ] axioms [ cols=\"<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ example_table ]    the first six axioms are the set theory of zermelo - frankel ( zf ) without the power set axiom and with the axiom schema of subsets ( a.k.a </S>",
    "<S> . , separation ) deleted from the axioms of regularity and replacement . </S>",
    "<S> because of the deletion of the axiom schema of subsets , a minimal @xmath0 , usually denoted by @xmath1 and called the set of all finite natural numbers , can not be shown to exist in this theory ; instead this set theory is uniformly dependent on @xmath0 and then all the finite as well as infinitely many infinite natural numbers are included in @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> these infinite numbers are one - to - one with @xmath0 ; a finite natural number is any member of @xmath0 that is not infinite .    </S>",
    "<S> we can now adjoin to this sub - theory of zf an axiom asserting that the subsets of @xmath0 are constructible . by constructible sets </S>",
    "<S> we mean sets that are generated sequentially by some process , one after the other , so that the process well - orders the sets . </S>",
    "<S> gdel has shown that an axiom asserting that all sets are constructible can be consistently added to zf @xcite , giving a theory usually called zfc@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that no more than countably many subsets of @xmath0 can be shown to exist in zfc@xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> this result will , of course , hold for the sub - theory zfc@xmath2 minus the axiom schema of subsets and the power set axiom . </S>",
    "<S> thus we can now add a new axiom which says that the subsets of @xmath0 are countably constructible . </S>",
    "<S> this axiom , combined with the axiom schema of bijective replacement , creates a set of constructible subsets of @xmath0 and deletion of the power set axiom then assures that no other subsets of @xmath0 exist in this theory .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall refer to these seven axioms as @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> all the sets of finite natural numbers in @xmath3 are finite . </S>",
    "<S> the general continuum hypothesis holds in this theory because all sets are countable . </S>",
    "<S> we now will also show that this theory is rich enough to contain functions of a real variable effectively governing physical fields .    </S>",
    "<S> we first show @xmath3 has a countable real line . </S>",
    "<S> recall the definition of `` rational numbers '' as the set of ratios , in zf called @xmath4 , of any two members of the set @xmath1 . in @xmath3 , </S>",
    "<S> we can likewise , using the axiom of unions , establish for @xmath0 the set of ratios of any two of its natural numbers , finite or infinite . </S>",
    "<S> this will become an `` enlargement '' of the rational numbers and we shall call this enlargement @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> two members of @xmath5 are called `` identical '' if their ratio is 1 . </S>",
    "<S> we now employ the symbol `` @xmath6 '' for `` is identical to . '' </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , an `` infinitesimal '' is a member of @xmath5 `` equal '' to 0 , i.e. , letting @xmath7 signify the member and employing the symbol `` = '' to signify equality , @xmath8 $ ] , where @xmath9 is a finite natural number . </S>",
    "<S> the reciprocal of an infinitesimal is `` infinite '' . </S>",
    "<S> a member of @xmath5 that is not an infinitesimal and not infinite is `` finite '' . </S>",
    "<S> the constructibility axiom well - orders the set of constructible subsets of @xmath0 and gives a metric space . </S>",
    "<S> these subsets then represent the binimals forming a countable real line @xmath10 . in this theory </S>",

    "<S> we can now define `` functions of a real variable in @xmath3 '' . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath19 is a function of a real variable in @xmath3 only if it is a constant or a sequence in @xmath20 of continuously connected biunique pieces such that the derivative of @xmath21 with respect to @xmath20 is also a function of a real variable in @xmath3 . </S>",

    "<S> if some derivative is a constant , they are polynomials . </S>",
    "<S> if no derivative is a constant , these functions do not _ per se _ exist in @xmath3 but can , however , always be represented as closely as required for physics by a sum of polynomials of sufficiently high degree obtained by an iteration of :    @xmath22 dx \\equiv \\lambda \\int_a^b ru^2 dx\\ ] ]    where @xmath23 is minimized subject to : @xmath24 where : @xmath25 at @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 are functions of the real variable @xmath20 .    </S>",
