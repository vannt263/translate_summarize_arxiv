    "recent years have seen extensive progress on understanding the nature and dynamics of topological solitons @xcite , and in particular of skyrmions . for the su(2 ) skyrme system , minimal - energy skyrmions resemble polyhedral shells @xcite ; for example , the 3-skyrmion looks like a tetrahedron @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the hopf - type solitons in the skyrme - faddeev system ( where the field takes values in the 2-sphere @xmath0 ) resemble closed loops , which may be linked or knotted @xcite ; for example , the 3-soliton in this system looks like a slightly - twisted circular loop . this paper describes a natural one - parameter family of generalized skyrme systems , which interpolates between the standard su(2 ) skyrme model and the skyrme - faddeev model .",
    "its minimum - energy solutions interpolate between polyhedral skyrmions and string - like hopf solitons .",
    "the simplest way to describe the family is as follows . in the su(2 ) skyrme model , the field takes values in the 3-sphere @xmath1 , with its standard metric .",
    "this 3-sphere is fibred over @xmath0 ( the hopf fibration ) ; and instead of the standard metric on @xmath1 , we can use a metric for which distances along the ( one - dimensional ) fibres are scaled by a factor which we denote @xmath2 .",
    "so @xmath3 gives the standard skyrme system , whereas @xmath4 corresponds to the target space being the quotient @xmath0 , namely the skyrme - faddeev system .",
    "the global symmetry so(4 ) in the @xmath3 case is broken to u(2 ) when @xmath5 ; and this in turn means that the generalized skyrmion solutions for @xmath5 have less symmetry than those for @xmath3 .",
    "the system can also be formulated in terms of a pair @xmath6 of complex scalars , and as such is related to condensed - matter systems in which there are two flavours of cooper pairs @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath7 then appears , in particular , as the coefficient of a term @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the current density .    in two spatial dimensions , and without the fourth - order skyrme terms",
    ", the case @xmath4 corresponds to the @xmath10 model .",
    "the generalization of this to @xmath11 was investigated in @xcite .",
    "it arises as a modification of the @xmath10 model which takes account of the effect of fermions ( starting with a system which has fermions as well as bosons , and integrating out the fermionic degrees of freedom ) . in this case",
    ", there are explicit finite - energy static solutions ( parametrized by @xmath7 ) which , for @xmath4 , are the usual instanton solutions of the 2-dimensional @xmath10 model . in the three - dimensional case which is discussed below",
    ", one needs a skyrme term to stabilize the solutions ; and the solutions have to be obtained numerically .",
    "let us consider , first , the general situation of a map @xmath12 from a 3-space ( with local coordinates @xmath13 and metric @xmath14 ) to another 3-space ( with local coordinates @xmath15 and metric @xmath16 ) . the skyrme energy density @xmath17 of such a map may be defined as follows @xcite , in terms of the differential @xmath18 of @xmath12 .",
    "define a @xmath19 matrix @xmath20 by @xmath21 then @xmath22 , where @xmath23.\\ ] ] here @xmath24 and @xmath25 are constants .",
    "if the metric @xmath16 admits a group of symmetries ( isometries ) , then these will correspond to ( global ) symmetries of the system .    in",
    "what follows , we take the target space to be the 3-sphere @xmath1 equipped with a one - parameter family of u(2)-invariant metrics .",
    "a particular member of this family is the standard so(4)-invariant metric , and the corresponding system is the usual su(2 ) skyrme model .",
    "the family of metrics may be described as follows .",
    "let @xmath6 denote a complex 2-vector satisfying the constraint @xmath26 ( where @xmath27 is the complex - conjugate row vector corresponding to the column vector @xmath28 ) .",
    "the set of all such vectors @xmath28 forms a 3-sphere .",
    "note that the map @xmath29 is the standard hopf fibration from @xmath1 to @xmath0 , with @xmath30 being the usual stereographic coordinate on @xmath0 .",
    "the standard metric @xmath31 on @xmath1 corresponds to @xmath32 let @xmath33 be the vector field obtained from the 1-form @xmath34 by raising its index with the metric ( [ stmet ] ) .",
    "this vector field @xmath33 has unit length , and is tangent to the fibres of the hopf fibration .",
    "our family of metrics , parametrized by the real number @xmath7 , is taken to be @xmath35 .",
    "an alternative way to write @xmath36 is @xmath37 note that both @xmath31 and @xmath38 , and hence also @xmath36 , are manifestly invariant under the u(2 ) transformations @xmath39 , where @xmath40 .    for @xmath11 , the metric ( [ met ] )",
    "is positive - definite .",
    "but when @xmath4 , it becomes degenerate , with @xmath33 being a zero - eigenvector ; distances along the hopf fibres are then zero , and the metric is , in effect , the standard metric on the quotient space @xmath41 . in other words ,",
    "our one - parameter family includes the standard 3-sphere ( @xmath3 ) and the standard 2-sphere ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "we will restrict to the range @xmath42 for which the metric is non - negative ; in fact , our interest is in the range @xmath43 , which interpolates between the skyrme and the skyrme - faddeev systems .",
    "the lagrangian @xmath44 of the generalized skyrme system ( consistent with the expressions ( [ gene ] ) for the static energy density ) may be described as follows .",
    "the vector @xmath28 determines an su(2 ) matrix according to @xmath45.\\ ] ] write @xmath46 = k_{\\mu\\nu } = { { \\rm i}}k^a_{\\mu\\nu}\\sigma_a,\\ ] ] where the partial derivative is with respect to space - time coordinates @xmath47 , and where @xmath48 denotes the pauli matrices .",
    "then @xmath49 , where @xmath50.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in this form , the global u(2 ) symmetry corresponds to @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is an su(2 ) matrix and @xmath53 is a diagonal su(2 ) matrix ; note that this transformation preserves both @xmath54 and @xmath55 .    if @xmath3 , then @xmath44 is the standard skyrme lagrangian . if @xmath4 , on the other hand , we get the skyrme - faddeev system @xcite .",
    "one way of seeing this is to replace the field @xmath28 by the unit 3-vector field @xmath56",
    ". then @xmath44 with @xmath4 becomes @xmath57 where @xmath58 ; this is the skyrme - faddeev lagrangian .",
    "if we take the space on which the field @xmath59 is defined to be @xmath60 , then we need a boundary condition @xmath61 ( constant ) as @xmath62 , to have finite energy .",
    "fields satisfying this condition are classified topologically by their winding number @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the topological charge density @xmath65 in the limit @xmath66 , @xmath67 equals the hopf number of the @xmath0-valued field .    the values of the constants @xmath24 and @xmath25 correspond to the energy and length scales .",
    "to choose convenient values for them in what follows , let us consider the system defined on the unit 3-sphere @xmath1 ( that is , take @xmath14 to be the standard metric on @xmath1 ) @xcite ; and take the field @xmath68 to correspond to the identity map from @xmath1 to itself ( in other words , an isometry if @xmath3 ) .",
    "it is straightforward to compute the energy @xmath69 of this field : one gets @xmath70 so from now on let us take @xmath71 , \\quad \\lambda_4=1/[4\\pi^2(3 - 2\\alpha)];\\ ] ] consequently , the ` identity ' field has unit energy for all @xmath72 $ ] .",
    "a numerical minimization procedure was used to find local minima of the static energy @xmath69 for various values of @xmath67 and @xmath7 , and hence stable skyrmion solutions ; the results are described below . the procedure uses a finite - difference version of the functional @xmath69 on a cubic grid , with a second - order scheme in which the truncation error is of order @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the lattice spacing , and using the coordinate @xmath75 for @xmath76 ( similarly for @xmath77 and @xmath78 ) so that the whole of @xmath60 is included . with a relatively small number of lattice points ( say @xmath79 ) , this achieves an accuracy of better than @xmath80 .",
    "the discrete energy was then minimized using a standard conjugate - gradient method ( flowing down the energy gradient ) .",
    "this produces a local minimum of the energy functional . in general , there are many local minima ; the starting configuration determines which one is produced by this procedure .",
    "it seems likely that the solutions described below are global minima in the relevant topological classes , but the only evidence for this at present is consistency with previous studies in the @xmath3 and @xmath4 cases @xcite .",
    "most straightforward are the @xmath81 and @xmath82 cases , where the solutions admit a continuous symmetry . for @xmath81 ,",
    "the @xmath3 skyrmion has o(3 ) ( spherical ) symmetry , and energy @xmath83 . when @xmath5 , this is broken to o(2 ) ( axial ) symmetry .",
    "the normalized energy @xmath84 depends smoothly on @xmath7 , and the numerical results indicate that , to within the small numerical error , its dependence is quadratic : @xmath85 .",
    "the topological charge density ( [ b ] ) has an almost - spherical shape , for all  @xmath7 .    for @xmath82 , one has o(2 ) symmetry both for @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the constant-@xmath64 surfaces resemble tori .",
    "so the expectation is that the @xmath82 generalized skyrmions will look like tori for all values of @xmath7 , with @xmath84 decreasing from @xmath86 to @xmath87 @xcite over the range @xmath72 $ ] ; but this has not been checked .",
    "it is worth remarking at this point on the energy - values of skyrme - faddeev solitons given in @xcite , so as to facilitate comparison with that paper .",
    "the energies in @xcite should be divided by a factor of @xmath88 in order to adjust the normalization to the one being used here ; and by a further factor of ( about ) @xmath89 to allow for the fact that @xcite used a finite - size box ( rather than all of @xmath60 ) .",
    "for example , in the @xmath82 case , @xcite gives an energy @xmath90 , which when divided by the two factors above yields @xmath91 .",
    "this is within @xmath92 of the correct figure .      for @xmath96 ,",
    "the picture is less straightforward , with the skyrmions having at most discrete symmetry .",
    "we look in detail at the cases @xmath93 and @xmath97 .",
    "the 3-skyrmion ( for @xmath3 ) has energy @xmath98 and tetrahedral symmetry @xcite ; in particular , a typical constant-@xmath64 surface resembles a tetrahedron .",
    "it is also useful to plot the curve in @xmath60 where @xmath99 , or equivalently where @xmath100 and @xmath101 ; in the faddeev - skyrme system , this curve may be interpreted as the position of the string - like hopf skyrmion @xcite .",
    "each plot in figure 1 depicts the surface @xmath102 , with the ` thickened ' curve @xmath103 strung around it ; subfigure ( a ) is for @xmath3 , ( b ) is for @xmath94 , and ( c ) is for @xmath95 .",
    "we see that as @xmath7 increases from zero , the tetrahedral skyrmion transforms into a twisted torus or loop ( see also the pictures in @xcite for the @xmath4 case ) .",
    "the tetrahedral symmetry is broken to the subgroup @xmath104 .",
    "the normalized energy @xmath84 again has a quadratic dependence on @xmath7 : @xmath105 .",
    "finally , let us look at the case @xmath97 .",
    "the 4-skyrmion ( for @xmath3 ) resembles a cube @xcite : see figure 2(a ) , where the same quantities are plotted as in figure 1 . as @xmath7 increases , the minimum - energy configuration becomes a closed loop strung along eight edges of the cube ( figure 2(b ) , for @xmath106 ) , which then flattens as @xmath7 increases further .",
    "when @xmath4 , one again gets a twisted circular loop , with the twisting being greater than in the @xmath93 case ( see also the pictures in @xcite ) .",
    "we have seen that the skyrme model and the skyrme - faddeev - hopf system may be regarded as members of a one - parameter family of generalized skyrme systems ; and the topological - soliton solutions of all these systems , although rather different in appearance , are all closely - related to one another .",
    "a recent paper @xcite has pointed out a similarity between sphaleron solutions of the skyrme system and axially - symmetric hopf solitons , especially as the winding number @xmath67 increases .",
    "these solutions are unstable ( saddle - points of their respective energy functionals ) ; and this connection between skyrmions and hopf solitons is quite different from the one described above",
    ". it may be of interest , however , to investigate sphaleron - type solutions of the family of skyrme systems , and see how they depend on the family parameter @xmath7 .    * note added in proof . *",
    "a similar family arises from considering bundles of strings [ s. nasir and a. j. niemi , mod .",
