    "a basic problem in quantum information science is to construct , if it exists , a _ quantum operation _ sending a given set of _ quantum states _",
    "@xmath0 to another set of quantum states @xmath2 ; see e.g. , @xcite and the references therein . quantum states are mathematically represented as _ density matrices _  positive semidefinite hermitian matrices with trace one , while quantum operations are represented by _ trace preserving completely positive linear maps _  mappings @xmath3 from the space of @xmath4 density matrices @xmath5 to @xmath6 density matrices @xmath7 having the form @xmath8 for some @xmath9 matrices @xmath10 satisfying @xmath11 . see @xcite for more details .",
    "thus given some density matrices @xmath12 and @xmath13 , our task is to find a completely positive linear map @xmath3 satisfying @xmath14 for each @xmath15 . in turn , if we let @xmath16 denote the _ standard orthonormal basis of @xmath5 _",
    ", then a mapping @xmath3 is a trace preserving completely positive linear map if , and only if , the celebrated _ choi matrix of @xmath3 _ , defined in block form by @xmath17 is positive semidefinite and the trace preserving constraints , @xmath18 , hold , where @xmath19 is the _ kronecker delta_. note that the choi matrix @xmath20 is a square @xmath21 matrix , and hence can be very large even for moderate values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . a little thought now shows that our problem is equivalent to the positive semidefinite feasibility problem for @xmath24 : @xmath25 where @xmath26 denotes the space of @xmath21 positive semi - definite hermitian matrices .",
    "moreover , the rank of the choi matrix @xmath27 has a natural interpretation : it is equal to the minimal number of summands needed in any representation of the form for the corresponding trace preserving completely positive map @xmath3 .",
    "because of the trace preserving constraints , the solution set of is bounded .",
    "thus , the problem is never _ weakly infeasible _ ,",
    "i.e. ,  infeasible but contains an asymptotically feasible sequence , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "in particular , one can use standard primal - dual interior point semidefinite programming packages to solve the feasibility problem .",
    "however , when the size of the problem ( @xmath28 ) grows , the efficiency and especially the accuracy of the semidefinite programming approach is limited . to illustrate , even for a reasonable sized problem @xmath29 ,",
    "the number of complex variables involved is @xmath30 . in this paper",
    ", we exploit the special structure of the problem and develop projection - based methods to solve high dimensional problems with high accuracy .",
    "we present numerical experiments based on the _ alternating projection ( map ) _ and the _ douglas - rachford ( dr ) _ projection / reflection methods .",
    "we see that the dr method significantly outperforms map for this problem .",
    "our numerical results show promise of projection - based approaches for many other types of feasibility problems arising in quantum information science .",
    "we begin by describing the method of alternating projections ( map ) and the douglas - rachford method ( dr ) in full generality . to this end , consider an euclidean space @xmath31 with an inner product @xmath32 and norm @xmath33 .",
    "we are interested in finding a point @xmath34 lying in the intersection of two closed subsets @xmath35 and @xmath36 of @xmath31 .",
    "for example @xmath35 may be an affine subspace of hermitian matrices ( over the reals ) and @xmath36 may be the convex cone of positive semi - definite hermitian matrices ( over the reals ) , as in our basic quantum channel problem .",
    "projection based methods then presuppose that given a point @xmath37 , finding a point in the nearest - point set @xmath38 is easy , as is finding a point in @xmath39 . when @xmath35 and @xmath36 are convex , the nearest - point sets @xmath40 and @xmath39 are singletons , of course .",
    "given a current point @xmath41 , the method of alternating projections then iterates the following two steps @xmath42 when @xmath35 and @xmath36 are convex and there exists a pair of nearest points of @xmath35 and @xmath36 , the method always generates iterates converging to such a pair . in particular ,",
    "when the convex sets @xmath35 and @xmath36 intersect , the method converges to some point in the intersection @xmath43 .",
    "moreover , when the relative interiors of @xmath35 and @xmath36 intersect , convergence is r - linear with the rate governed by the cosines of the angles between the vectors @xmath44 and @xmath45 . for details ,",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "when @xmath35 and @xmath36 are not convex , analogous convergence guarantees hold , but only if the method is initialized sufficiently close to the intersection @xcite .",
    "the douglas rachford algorithm takes a more asymmetric approach .",
    "given a point @xmath37 , we define the reflection operator @xmath46 the douglas rachford algorithm is then a `` reflect - reflect - average '' method ; that is , given a current iterate @xmath47 , it generates the next iterate by the formula @xmath48 it is known that for convex instances , the `` projected iterates '' converge @xcite . the rate of convergence , however , is not well - understood . on the other hand ,",
    "the method has proven to be extremely effective empirically for many types of problems ; see for example @xcite .",
    "the salient point here is that for map and dr to be effective in practice , the nearest point mappings @xmath49 and @xmath50 must be easy to evaluate .",
    "we next observe that for the quantum channel construction problem  our basic problem  these mappings are indeed fairly easy to compute ( especially the projection onto the affine subspace ) .      in the current work",
    ", we always consider the space of hermitian matrices @xmath51 as an euclidean space , that is we regard @xmath51 as an inner product space over the reals in the obvious way . as usual , we then endow @xmath51 with the frobenius norm @xmath52 , where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the real and the complex parts of @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "recall that our basic problem is to find a hermitian matrix @xmath24 satisfying @xmath56 we aim to apply map and dr to this formulation . to this end , we first need to introduce some notation to help with the exposition .",
    "define the linear mappings @xmath57 and let @xmath58 moreover assemble the vectors @xmath59 thus we aim to find a matrix @xmath27 in the intersection of @xmath26 with the affine subspace @xmath60 projecting a hermitian matrix @xmath27 onto @xmath26 is standard due to the eckart - young theorem , @xcite .",
    "indeed if @xmath61 is an eigenvalue decomposition of @xmath27 , then we have @xmath62 where for any real number @xmath63 , we set @xmath64 . thus projecting a hermitian matrix onto @xmath65",
    "requires a single eigenvalue decomposition  a procedure for which there are many efficient and well - tested codes ( e.g. ,  @xcite ) .",
    "we next describe how to perform the projection onto the affine subspace @xmath66 , that is how to solve the nearest point problem @xmath67 classically , the solution is @xmath68 where @xmath69 is the moore - penrose generalized inverse of @xmath70 and @xmath71 is the residual .",
    "finding the moore - penrose generalized inverse of a large linear mapping , like the one we have here , can often be time consuming and error prone .",
    "luckily , the special structure of the affine constraints in our problem allow us to find @xmath69 both very quickly and very accurately , so that in all our experiments the time to compute the projection onto @xmath66 is negligible compared to the computational effort needed to perform the eigenvalue decompositions .",
    "we now describe how to compute @xmath69 in more detail ; full details can be found in the supplementary text@xcite .",
    "henceforth , we use the matlab command @xmath72 to denote a vectorization of the matrix @xmath73 .",
    "we now construct the matrix @xmath74 by declaring @xmath75 we then separate @xmath76 into three blocks @xmath77 where @xmath78 has rows formed from the diagonals of matrices @xmath79 , and @xmath80 and @xmath81 have rows formed from the real and imaginary parts of @xmath79 , respectively , for @xmath82 .",
    "define now the matrices @xmath83 permuting the rows and columns of @xmath84 in a certain way , described in @xcite , we obtain a matrix denoted by @xmath85 . then @xmath70 can be represented in coordinates ( i.e. acting on a vectorization of @xmath27 ) in a surprisingly simple way , namely as a matrix :    @xmath86    where @xmath87 denotes the kronecker product , and @xmath88 denotes the triangular number @xmath89 .",
    "let the matrix @xmath90 have orthonormal columns that yield a basis for @xmath91 , i.e. , @xmath92 the generalized inverse of the top - left block is trivial to find from @xmath85 .",
    "an explicit expression for the generalized inverse of the bottom right - block can also be found .",
    "therefore , we get an explicit blocked structure for the moore - penrose generalized inverse of the complete matrix representation . @xmath93 as claimed .",
    "thus @xmath94 is easy to construct by simply stacking various small matrices together in blocks .",
    "moreover , this means that both expressions @xmath95 and @xmath96 can be _",
    "vectorized _ and evaluated efficiently and accurately .",
    "in this section , we numerically illustrate the effectiveness of the projection / reflection methods for solving quantum channel construction problems .",
    "the large / huge problems were solved on an amd opteron(tm ) processor 6168 , 1900.089 mhz cpu running linux .",
    "the smaller problems were solved using an optiplex 9020 , intel(r ) core(tm ) , i7 - 4770 cpus , 3.40ghz,3.40 ghz , ram 16 gb running windows 7 .    for simplicity of exposition , in our numerical experiments",
    ", we set @xmath97 .",
    "moreover , we will impose the unital constraint @xmath98 , a common condition in quantum information science .",
    "we note in passing that the unital constraint implies that the last constraint in each density matrix block of constraints for each @xmath99 is redundant . to generate random instances for our tests we proceed as follows .",
    "we start with given integers @xmath100 and a value for @xmath63 .",
    "we generate a choi matrix @xmath27 using @xmath63 random unitary matrices @xmath101 and a positive probability distribution @xmath102 , i.e. ,  we set @xmath103 note that , given a density matrix @xmath104 , then the trace preserving completely positive map can now be evaluated using the blocked form of @xmath27 in as @xmath105 we then generate random density matrices @xmath106 and set @xmath107 as the image of the corresponding trace preserving completely positive map @xmath3 on @xmath79 , for all @xmath99 .",
    "this guarantees that we have a feasible instance of rank @xmath63 and larger / smaller @xmath63 values result in larger / smaller rank for the feasible choi matrix @xmath27 .",
    "we set @xmath108 to be @xmath109 to enforce the unital constraint .",
    "we first look at our basic feasibility problem .",
    "we illustrate the numerical results only using the dr algorithm since we found it to be vastly superior to map ; see section [ sect : drmap ] , below .",
    "we found solutions of huge problems with surprisingly high accuracy and very few iterations .",
    "the results are presented in table [ table : drfeasp ] .",
    "we give the size of the problem , the number of iterations , the norm of the residual ( accuracy ) at the end , the maximum value of the cosine values indicating the linear rate of convergence , and the total computational time to perform a projection on the psd cone .",
    "the projection on the psd cone dominates the time of the algorithm , i.e. ,  the total time is roughly the number of iterations times the projection time . to fathom",
    "the size of the problems considered , observe that a problem with @xmath110 finds a psd matrix of order @xmath111 which has approximately @xmath30 variables .",
    "moreover , we reiterate that the solutions are found with extremely high accuracy in very few iterations .",
