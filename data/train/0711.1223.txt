    "observational effects caused by primordial molecules seem to be most promising in investigating dark ages epoch of the universe .",
    "the basic properties of the molecules are discrete narrow energy levels and high efficiency of their interaction with cmbr .",
    "this leads to forming ssf if proto - objects , containing these molecules , move with peculiar velocities v@xmath9 relative to cmbr ( dubrovich,1977,1982 , puy,1993 ) .",
    "we may consider ssf as manifestation of the proto - objects at high redshifts 300 @xmath10 10 as scattering of cmb photons by primordial molecules must leave imprints on the cmbr temperature distribution .",
    "the most abundant chemical elements predicted by the pure big bang model are h , he , d , @xmath11he , li and their ions .",
    "they give some molecules in the primordial matter at z=100 - 200 such as h@xmath12,h@xmath13,hd , hd@xmath2 , heh@xmath2 , lih , lih@xmath2 , h@xmath12d@xmath2 .",
    "there are other molecules which should be considered if non - standard nuclear synthesis at the early times ( z=10@xmath14 ) or star formation at z = 100 - 200 took place .",
    "for the high efficiency of interaction between molecules and cmbr photons two values are important - the cross - section for scattering and the concentration ( or relative abundance ) of this molecule .",
    "the first parameter depends on the specific quantum structure of the molecule - its symmetry and dipole moment .",
    "the second one depends on the abundance of the chemical elements of which it is composed and on the rate of the appropriate chemical reactions . according to these constraints",
    ", we should take into consideration only those molecules which have a large enough dipole moment and relatively high abundance .",
    "these are hd@xmath2 , heh@xmath2 , lih , h@xmath12 d@xmath2 .",
    "we consider them as the basic molecules interacting with cmbr at high z ( dubrovich,1977,1982,puy et al.,1993,stancil et al.,1996 ) .",
    "let us remind physical conditions in dark ages epoch when the universe was younger than 300 mil .",
    "the universe was in @xmath15 times smaller and in @xmath16 times more dense than now , temperature of cmbr and molecular gas followed @xmath17 law till z @xmath18150 .",
    "then , temperature of matter should be lower than cmbr temperature due to different adiabatic indexes of radiation and matter ( varshalovich , hhersonskii , sunyaev , 1981 ) and it must follow @xmath19 law till first star formation .",
    "calculated temperatures of cmbr and molecular gas in dark ages epoch are given in table 1 , we used @xmath20 = 2.726 k ( mather et al . , 1994 ) . in epoch before secondary ionization molecules are formed in accordance with kinetic rate of specific chemical reactions when matter and radiation are cooling .",
    "after reionization molecular formation follows a more complicated law due to growth of ionization degree of hydrogen and existence of heavy chemical elements produced by first stars ( basu , hernandez - monteagudo , sunyaev , 2004 ) .",
    ".temperatures of cmbr and molecular gas in dark ages epoch z=300 - 10 [ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     if we realize a channel bandwidth of @xmath21=2% in 3 mm band preferable or optimal linear scales for ssf search are l=1.5 mpc for heh@xmath22(i=0 ) at z=20 and l=0.75 mpc for lih(i=6 ) at z=30 , correspondent angular sizes according to ( 7 ) are 10.7@xmath7 and 7.5@xmath7 .",
    "recent wmap polarization measurements have shown strong probability of an early reionization scenario with @xmath23 ( kogut et al , 2003 , page et al , 2006 ) due to pop iii stars ( wyithe , loeb,2003 ) in galaxy halos .",
    "ssf detection at z=20 - 30 may provide us with important information about ionization history of the universe .",
    "the question is which maximum proto - object scales are reasonable , could exist at z=20 - 30 or are connected with some known scales in the universe .",
    "let us compare them with spatial scales of primary cmba .",
    "the angular scale of the first peak in primary cmbr power spectrum @xmath24 50@xmath7 , the following cmba peaks are @xmath25 1/2@xmath26,1/3@xmath26 , and 1/5@xmath26 ( see fig.2 down ) .",
    "then possible spatial scales l of 1 - 4 peaks in cmbr power spectrum for different @xmath27 are given in the table 5 with ( 7 ) and ( 6 ) .",
    "the above consideration shows that at @xmath4t / t=2@xmath2810 @xmath6 level and with @xmath21=2% we can search for ssf which are the result of large scale proto - object motion with peculiar velocity relative to cmbr at z=20 - 30 .",
    "these possible proto - objects are still less than spatial scale of the fourth peak in cmbr power spectrum ( table 5 ) which might be related to a proto - galaxy scale . with less @xmath21 , higher sensitivity and multipole resolution we can approach to smaller spatial scales of proto - objects up to proto - star scales .",
    "ssf firstly proposed as a new phenomena in ( dubrovich , 1977 ) is one of most promising secondary cmba .",
    "ssf is non - isotropic spectral distortions of cmbr which are to be present at z=300 - 10 .",
    "homogeneous and isotropic spectral distortions of cmbr may be present at z=6000 - 1000 due to primordial helium and hydrogen recombination ( dubrovich , 1975 , dubrovich , stolyarov , 1995 , dubrovich , shahvorostova , 2004 , dubrovich , grachev , 2004 ) .",
    "non - isotropic distortions of cmbr similar to ssf may be present in this epoch at lower @xmath0 level as well(dubrovich , 1977/2 ) .",
    "calculation of this effect in more details at z=1000 - 1100 is done in ( rubino - martin , mernandez - monteagudo and sunyaev , 2005 ) .",
    "let us remind that cmbr temperature fluctuations are expanded in spherical harmonics ( peebles , 1993,peacock , 1999 ) : @xmath29    the angular power spectrum @xmath30 of @xmath0 can be related to the autocorrelation function @xmath31 as : @xmath32    where @xmath33 are legendre polynomials , l - multipole moment and @xmath34 .",
    "theoretical predictions of @xmath35 are usually quoted as    @xmath36    @xmath37    as we consider small - angle patches of the sky cmbr fluctuations @xmath38 may be generated by evaluating the simple fourier series ( bond et al , 1987 ) :    @xmath39\\ ] ]    where @xmath40 denotes the size of the simulated region in radians ; @xmath41 are cartesian coordinates on the sky ( spatial domain ) ; @xmath42 are coordinates of fourier components @xmath43 in spatial frequency domain , @xmath44 , @xmath45 .    for the search of ssf cmbr maps obtained in several spectral channels",
    "are to be studied and then processed by the special frequency - differential or the difference method ( dubrovich , bajkova,2004 ) .",
    "the difference method can be considered as an alternative method to the correlation function analysis . in this case",
    "we are interested in the first derivative of spatial distortions with respect to the frequency .",
    "the method used is based on the analysis of a difference of two cmbr temperature maps observed at different frequencies and reduced to one beam shape .",
    "mainly , such a difference map contains information only on the secondary fluctuations because the primary cmbr fluctuations present in both maps will be eliminated due to their black - body spectrum nature .",
    "the procedure of ssf simulation is the following .",
    "firstly cmb map is generated with a standard cmb power spectrum .",
    "then amplitudes of fft spectrum of cmb map are kept while phases are modified as random values uniformly distributed in the interval 0 - 2@xmath46 .",
    "a backward fft gives us an approximation of cmb map which contains primary and secondary fluctuations in conditions of unknown theoretical power spectrum of ssf .",
    "the actual theoretical power spectrum of ssf is to be a subject of nearest energetic efforts , it is strongly needed for following ssf investigation .",
    "let the difference of the cmbr observation frequencies be equal to @xmath47 .",
    "let the limiting angular fluctuation size @xmath26 corresponds to this frequency difference in accordance with equation ( 5 ) .",
    "obviously , the fluctuations of size larger than @xmath26 will be seen at both maps .",
    "after subtraction of one map from the other the fluctuations of size larger than @xmath26 will be mutually suppressed and the remainder map will contain only the fluctuations smaller than @xmath26 . evidently , this fact can be seen also from angular power spectrum of this map which is close to zero at frequencies with multipoles @xmath48 and different from zero at @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the break of the spectrum .",
    "now let the difference of two frequencies be @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "the angular size @xmath53 corresponds to this frequency interval .",
    "obviously , @xmath54 in accordance with equation ( 5 ) .",
    "in this case we will see at the difference map the fluctuations with size smaller than @xmath53 and the corresponding angular power spectrum will have the break at @xmath55 .",
    "our cmba model also includes convolution of expected cmba maps with a simulated radio telescope beam and adding a pixel noise .",
    "differential maps are preliminary processed to decrease the noise in given power spectrum region .",
    "let convolved cmbr maps have spatial scales l@xmath56 @xmath57 ( l@xmath58-m@xmath59 , then the spatial scale of differential maps is ( l@xmath58-n@xmath60l@xmath61)@xmath57l@xmath58 , where m=0,1,2 ... , @xmath4l@xmath61/l corresponds to @xmath62/@xmath632% in our case ) .",
    "let us limit l@xmath64 in the simulation by l=1056 which is near to the lowest reasonable limit of l@xmath58 in the ground based mm - wave ssf experiment .",
    "we will use in simulation a standard @xmath65cdm cmbr model ( spergel et al .",
    ", 2003 , spergel et al , 2006 ) with parameters : @xmath66=0.2(@xmath67/100 km / smpc , @xmath68 km / smpc ) , @xmath69=0.65 , @xmath70 , n=1 , h=0.65 .",

    "fig.3 demonstrates predicted difference ssf map without an instrumental noise(up ) and with white instrumental noise ( down ) added in single frequency maps with s / n=1.17 .",
    "power equalization method of wiener filtration ( gorski , 1997 ) was applied in this case as signal preliminary processing to decrease the noise in given power spectrum region . in spite of a correlation coefficient of two difference maps of fig.3",
    "is less than 0.15 the power spectra of the difference signal after wiener filtration are similar ( fig.3 right ) that is the most important to recognize ssf in a real ssf search experiment . but this is true for white instrumental noise and we concentrate our efforts in section 4 to avoid or minimize abnormal instrumental pixel noise in the ssf search experiment .    9.5 cm     it was assumed in above simulation that the observed cmbr maps consist only of the primary and secondary cmbr fluctuations with some additive white instrumental noise .",
    "however , in practice the cmbr detected maps in addition contain a number of astrophysical foregrounds such as extragalactic unresolved sources , free - free and synchrotron radiation , sz effect , galactic dust and so on .",
    "astrophysical foregrounds are characterized by considerably low value of spectral index as compared with the analyzed secondary cmbr fluctuations and are successfully eliminated in difference maps .",
    "up to now practically all cmbr ground based and space experiments study primary cmba which has black body spectrum .",
    "primary cmba was 30 years under investigation at ratan-600 radio telescope since 1977 ( parijskij , korolkov , 1986 , parijskij et al , 2005 ) .",
    "first attempts of ssf observations were done in 1992 at iram mm radio telescope with the upper @xmath4t / t limit 2@xmath2810@xmath75 at 1.3 mm ( de bernardis , dubrovich et al , 1993 ) and in 2001 at ratan-600 ( the near pole survey ) with the upper @xmath4t / t limit 10@xmath76 at 6 cm ( gosachinskii , dubrovich et al.,2001 ) .",
    "surplus frequency resolution of the existing spectrum - analyzers ( 30 mhz and 20 khz ) increased @xmath4t / t limit in both cases . the far infrared absolute spectrometer(firas ) instrument has shown that cmb has ideal black body spectrum from 60 ghz to 600 ghz and cmb temperature is 2.725 + -0.001 k(fixsen , mather,2002 ) .",
    "then fixsen et all reported about an effort to measure distortions of cmb black body spectrum due to of various processes in early universe .",
    "this attempt was done in arcade balloon - born experiment where cmb temperatures were measured at 10 ghz and 30 ghz with accuracy + -0.010 k and + -0.032 k ( fixsen et all , 2004 ) . in this paper",
    "we suggest a concept and strategy of the ssf experiment with @xmath60t / t limit @xmath77 .",
    "high absolute measurement accuracy is not necessary in this experiment as we need to measure differential temperatures in nearby receiver channels without measuring absolute cmb temperatures .",
    "simulation of possible ssf experiment is done for msrt ( khaikin et al , 2002,2003 ) , tuorla observatory , finland ( fig.4 ) equipped with a 7x4 beam cryo - microblometer array at 3 mm with rf multiplexer providing up to 7 spectral channels in each beam .",
    "the scheme of the experiment is given in fig.5 .",
    "firstly idea of such an experiment is suggested in ( dubrovich , bajkova , khaikin , 2004 , khaikin , dubrovich , 2004 , khaikin , luukanen , dubrovich , 2005 ) . in this paper",
    "we develop the concept and present simulation results of a possible experiment .",
    "the challenge is to split rf band in front of bolometers .",
    "if superconducting nb microstrip resonant @xmath78/4 stub filters are used in rf multiplexer ( rfm ) the in - band transmission can approach unity due to negligible loss of the superconducter . to simplify a multiplexer design",
    "the number of filters and spectral channels may be reduced to 5 or even 3 .",
    "a wideband microstrip superconducting frequency multiplexer is applied in front of tes bolometers in samba(superconducting antenna - coupled multifrequency bolometric array ) , where low loss and excellent out - of - band rejection is demonstrated at 3 frequencies of mm band ( goldin et al , 2003 ) .",
    "antenna - coupled tes bolometer with an integrated microstrip bp filter at 217 ghz is applied for a bolometer array in a ground based cmb polarization experiment ( myers et al , 2005 ) .",
    "another way to split radio frequency band in a bolometric receiver is to build a quasi - optical filter based on metal mesh filters(mmf ) or frequency - selective surfaces ( fss ) .",
    "a review of quasi - optical mmfs is given in ( ade et al , 2006 ) .",
    "a few possible designs of cryogenic mmfs with bandwidth up to 6@xmath79 at 1 - 3 mm are given in ( page,1994 ) .",
    "3 cryogenic filter wheels with several bandpass filters , are under development now in columbia university for millimeter bolometric array camera ( mbac ) to provide 5 - 10% frequency resolution in one octave mm band from 150 ghz to 300 ghz at atacama cosmology telescope(act ) .",
    "fss may be also used to separate in space radio telescope foci in which several feeds or arrays at different frequencies may be placed ( kasyanov , khaikin , 2004 ) .",
    "but it is difficult to achieve frequency resolution with mmf or fss better than 5@xmath79 and superconducting @xmath80 microstrip resonant filters are more effective in our case .",
    "we consider several variants of an array feed . as",
    "a narrow flare corrugated horn is difficult to build in 3 mm band a trimode conical horn may be used to provide a small flare angle with an acceptable sidelobe level ( less than 20 db in e / h plane ) and low frequency cut - off near 87 ghz .",
    "a smooth - walled spline - profile horn(granet et al , 2004 ) is an alternative to both corrugated and trimode horns and it allows us to achieve an identical radiation pattern in e / h plane in the band , low sidelobe level(less than -25 db ) , more tight array packaging and lower manufacture cost .",
    "we are in final stage now to build and test such a horn for array applications al lower frequencies ( 30 ghz-38 ghz ) in cooperation with c.granet(csiro)(khaikin et al,2007 ) .",
    "a 2 m precise carbon fiber msrt dish ( khaikin et al,2002 ) allows us to work in 100 ghz and 150 ghz bands but the second one is much more difficult due to higher atmospheric attenuation and antenna scattering background .",
    "angular resolution of msrt is 7@xmath7 - 6@xmath7 at 88 ghz-100 ghz that is enough for a large scale ssf experiment and corresponds to l@xmath58=@xmath46/@xmath81=1542 - 1800 ( for full sky coverage ) the same as at plank ( 7@xmath7 , l=1542 ) and twice better than at wmap(l@xmath58=750 ) .",
    "nevertheless for a ground based or balloon experiment @xmath82 , where @xmath83 ( size of the symmetrical map ) and actual spatial resolution of msrt is not higher than l=1200 - 1500 for partial sky coverage . in boomerang balloon experiment",
    "actual resolution was less than l=1025 at 150 ghz(de benardis et al.,2002 ) .",
    "1000@xmath84 seems to be optimal for ssf search at current stage . at higher l with the low frequency resolution s",
    "/ n ratio falls . besides , in ground based experiments with higher angular resolution such as cosmic microwave imager ( cbi ) ( readhead et al,2004 ) with l @xmath58= 3500 point sources were a serious problem at 26 - 36 ghz as the power spectrum of primary cmba falls rapidly with l while the point source contribution grows as l@xmath85 in the band .",
    "point source contamination is still dangerous at 3 mm at higher l if secondary cmba has a falling spectrum .",
    "some secondary cmba may have inverted @xmath30 spectra when the magnitude of @xmath30 grows at higher l ( doroshkevich , dubrovich , 2001 ) .",
    "however ssf search at l@xmath861500 needs both higher sensitivity and higher frequency resolution which contradicts each other .",
    "a multifeed or receiver array is needed in a ssf experiment to get a cmbr map in an unmovable radio telescope mode ( preferable ) or to accelerate mapping in a scanning mode ( less preferable because of variable instrumental effects ) .",
    "we plan to use a chopping mode to reduce an abnormal instrumental noise and atmospheric effects .",
    "a chopper with beam deviation @xmath87 will distort power spectrum of ssf due to filtration of scales @xmath88 and changing the amplitudes at scales @xmath89 but this is not so dangerous in the task of ssf search .",
    "the main role of the chopper is to suppress uncorrelated residual 1/f noise of different bolometers which can not be eliminated in difference maps .",
    "identical and stable calibration of all receiver channels is very important in this experiment .",
    "it may be produced quasi - optically by a lens , forming a lateral plane wave for a whole array .",
    "a high stable noise generator with a direct coupler or a matched black body load is placed in the lens focus .",
    "a calibration source must be put in a reverse two level thermostat realizing 0.1 k accuracy at the first and not less than 0.01 k accuracy at the second level .        according to our concept msrt",
    "central beam is fixed near the north celestial pole ( ncp ) at @xmath90=86@xmath71 to increase cosmic source passing time via the beam up to 348s -402s and to observe the 1@xmath71 x 8@xmath71 strip preferably in low culmination from @xmath91=8@xmath9200@xmath93 to 16@xmath9200@xmath93 at high galactic latitudes .",

    "fopas allows us to optimize fpa geometry with the beam spacing and the overlapping level which are optimal for the given astrophysical task .",

    "atmospheric fluctuations are to be effectively suppressed with a chopper while high atmospheric attenuation is the most dangerous for a ground based mm - wave ssf experiment with cryo - bolometers .",
    "atmosphere gives the main limitation in sensitivity in mm wave ground based ssf experiment with cryo - bolometers as it will contribute up to 80% in a system temperature and in some cases may saturate ( overheat ) a cryo - bolometer .",
    "the bolometer must be able to absorb up to 1 pw in order to avoid saturation with photon nep @xmath113 wt / hz@xmath97 .",
    "this requires a rather high dynamic range d which is the ratio of the maximum power detected to the minimal detectable power . for expected sensitivity 1",
    "mk s@xmath97 d must be not worse than 45 db .",
    "in fact only days with lowest atmospheric opacity ( lowest water vapour content ) may be used for such an experiment at sea level .",
    "it was shown by a `` tipping curve '' method that typical atmospheric opacity at msrt site in zenith @xmath114 is 0.2 db at 36.5 ghz for dry clear autumn nights ( khaikin et al , 2003 ) that gives predicted @xmath115 at 94 ghz 0.3 db - 0.5 db in clear cold winter nights with lowest integrated water wapour content ( @xmath116 ) .",
    "an effective beam wobbling made it possible to reduce residual atmospheric noise @xmath4t@xmath98 and spillover @xmath4t@xmath117 up to 10 @xmath111k at 40 ghz in sk cmbr experiment in canada ( wollack et al , 1994 ) , where the radiometric offset was less than 7 @xmath111k per day for all observations .",
    "a special ground screen ( height up to 3 m ) is to be installed near msrt ( fig.5 ) to avoid the contribution of the hot atmosphere and ground via sidelobes , spillover and scattering background and provide t@xmath118= 33 k at high elevation angles including own antenna temperature , atmosphere ( 20 k ) and cmbr(khaikin , luukanen , dubrovich,2005 ) .",
    "the residual non - thermal instrumental noise must be significantly reduced up to 30 @xmath111k in differential maps while thermal noise grows by a factor 2@xmath119 in comparison with single frequency maps .",
    "non - thermal noise can not be reduced lower in difference maps due to residual abnormal ( 1/f ) instrumental noise , some difference in radiation patterns , in amplitude - frequency characteristics of the channels and some difference in atmospheric effects within 12% bandwidth .    in spite of atmospheric limitations a ground based ssf mm wave experiment has advantages in the cost , flexibility and possible duration . in space conditions",
    "tes bolometers may give one - two orders better sensitivity . in ( ali et al , 2003 ) netd=25 @xmath111 k / s@xmath119 per pixel is expected in space for cmbr at 90 ghz for 100 tes detectors with the physical temperature less than 0.1 k and nep=@xmath120 wt / hz@xmath97 . yet , most of new generation mm wave cmbr projects chose multi - element bolometer arrays to reach highest sensitivity in the ground based experiment . @xmath121 per detector",
    "must be reached in 1000 element array of tes bolometers at 10 m south pole telescope(spt ) in 20% bandwidth at 95 ghz and 150 ghz(ruhl et al , 2004 ) .",
    "millimeter bolometric array camera(mbac ) with 3 1000-element tes bolometer arrays at 150 ghz/220 ghz/270 ghz is under development now for 6 m atacama cosmology telescope(act ) project ( fowler , 2004 ) .",
    "expected mbac sensitivity to cmbr is 300 @xmath111k/500@xmath111k/700@xmath111k@xmath122 per detector        &    &    &    &     + & & & & + @xmath100 &    & & & + & & & @xmath123 & +    in a ground based experiment at sea level atmospheric effects contribute much more than astrophysical foregrounds nevertheless we should take them into account to better prepare the experiment .",
    "galactic and extragalactic dust emission will significantly dominate at 3 mm over other foreground effects such as discrete and diffuse sources , galactic synchrotron and free - free emission , hot clusters of galaxies .",
    "dust fluctuations are seen on all angular scales from 2@xmath7 to tens of degrees on iras data ( low et al.,1984 ) .",
    "antenna temperature is @xmath124 , where @xmath125 is the spectral index which depends upon the emissivity of the dust and lies in the range of 1.5 - 2.2 according to cobe , iras and wmap data .",
    "after 60 ghz galactic and extragalactic dust dominate and we should carefully chose cmbr map coordinates in dust free areas of the universe at high galactic latitudes . the full sky thermal dust map based on data from iras and cobe using mem procedure",
    "shows a wide range of temperatures from 400 @xmath111k to 15 @xmath111k in w band of wmap ( 94 ghz ) ( bennet at el , 2004 ) .",
    "contribution of dust emission is to be significantly eliminated in differential maps as this component must be well enough correlated in single frequency maps due to its black - body spectrum .",
    "as it was shown in section 2 the expected signal ( @xmath0 of ssf ) depends on many cosmological parameters and conditions in early universe such as @xmath126,@xmath127 , @xmath128 , @xmath129,@xmath130,@xmath131 and others while the best s / n ratio at given z also depends on @xmath21 .",
    "it is extremely difficult to predict the most probable combination of these parameters at different z in early universe and ssf experiments are urgently needed to set ssf an uppper limit at @xmath0=@xmath132 level and specify theoretical predictions of ssf .",
    "we want to emphasize in final remarks the significance of ssf detection which leads to the discovery of the cosmological molecules .",
    "cosmological molecules can provide an unique test to non - standard nuclear synthesis at high z. ssf can only help us in investigating dark ages epoch in the early universe ( @xmath133 ) .",
    "ssf detection at z=20 - 30 may give an important information about ionization history of the universe .",
    "finally , they will allow us to explore physical properties of dark matter and dark energy .",
    "observational effects caused by interaction of primordial molecules with cmbr seem to be most promising in investigating of dark ages epoch of the early universe and ionization history of the universe . strategy and concept of the experiment",
    "are given .",
    "simulation of the experiment in an atmospheric transparency window at 3 mm with msrt equipped with a 7x4 beam cryo - microbolometer array gives us the expected sensitivity of 50 - 55 @xmath111k in the differential cmbr maps near ncp with angular resolution 6@xmath7 - 7@xmath7 ( l=1200 - 1500 ) and frequency resolution * * @xmath4**@xmath134/@xmath135=2% .",
