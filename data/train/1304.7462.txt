    "harris was the first to provide a theoretical derivation for this phenomena by using statistical arguments @xcite . for a finite system , e.g single - file diffusion in a box , the tagged particle s mean- square- displacement reaches equilibrium , @xmath2 @xcite ( see also @xcite for periodic boundary condition ) .",
    "an intriguing treasure is found in an appendix of lizana et al .",
    "they note by passing that the generalized diffusion coefficient @xmath3 is sensitive to the way the system is prepared .",
    "that is a surprising result since we expect diffusivities of interacting system not to be sensitive to the initial conditions .    here",
    "we confirm this prediction using the jepsen line , showing that the prediction in @xcite is correct . to show that @xmath3 is sensitive to the initial state of the system we consider two ensembles of initial conditions : an initial state that is taken from equilibrium versus particles initially situated in equal distances between each other .",
    "we show that @xmath3 for both ensembles differs by a prefactor of @xmath4 .",
    "since transport coefficient like @xmath3 , for the many - body interacting system , is sensitive to initial preparation we must challenge basic concepts in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",

    "the system is stretched from @xmath10 to @xmath11 .",

    "we consider two types of initial conditions .",
    "the first is the case of particles distributed with fixed density , namely the distance between particles are exponentially distributed with mean distance between particles is @xmath14 .",

    "the second case we consider is the case where particles are initially situated on a lattice , with equal distances between particles @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the lattice constant .",

    "in this section we find the mean - square - displacement ( msd ) with a rigorous method by treating the problem with a theoretical tool called the jepsen line ( see details below ) @xcite .",

    "notice that the difference between the mean - square - displacement ( msd ) of the two initial conditions is a pre - factor of @xmath4 ( see fig.[fig : lattice1 ] ) .",
    "more specifically we compared between the two initial condition by taking @xmath26 since that is the average separation between particles on the lattice .",
    "this is a surprising effect , since we find that the influence of the initial conditions on the diffusion of the tagged particle in infinite system is lasting forever .",
