    "there has been a lot of interest on the cauchy problem for the irrotational water waves problem since the work of s. wu ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "more relevant for our present work is the eulerian approach developed by d. lannes ( @xcite ) in the presence of a bottom .",
    "another program initiated by w. craig ( @xcite ) consists in justifying the use of the many asymptotic models that exist in the physical literature to describe the motion of water waves .",
    "this requires a local wellposedness result that is uniform with respect to the small parameters involved ( typically , the shallow water parameter ) .",
    "this was achieved by b. alvarez - samaniego and d. lannes ( @xcite ) for many regimes ; other references in this direction are ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the irrotational framework is however not always the relevant one . when dealing with wave - current interactions or , at larger scales , if one wants to take into account the coriolis force .",
    "the latter configuration motivates the present study .",
    "several authors considered the local wellposedness theory for the water waves equations in the presence of vorticity ( @xcite or @xcite for instance ) .",
    "recently , a. castro and d. lannes proposed a generalization of the zakharov - craig - sulem formulation ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite for an explanation of this formulation ) , and gave a system of three equations that allow for the presence of vorticity .",
    "then , they used it to derive new shallow water models that describe wave current interactions and more generally the coupling between waves and vorticity effects ( @xcite and @xcite ) . in this paper , we base our study on their formulation .",
    "this paper is organized in three parts : firstly we derive a generalization of the castro - lannes formulation that takes into account the coriolis forcing as well as non flat bottoms and a non constant pressure at the surface ; secondly , we prove a local wellposedness result taking account the dependence of small parameters ; finally , we justify that the rotational shallow water model is a good asymptotic model of the rotational water waves equations under a coriolis forcing .",
    "we model the sea by an incompressible ideal fluid bounded from below by the seabed and from above by a free surface .",
    "we suppose that the seabed and the surface are graphs above the still water level .",
    "the pressure at the surface is of the form @xmath0 where @xmath1 models a meteorological disturbance and @xmath2 is a constant which represents the pressure far from the meteorological disturbance .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the horizontal dimension , which is equal to @xmath4 or @xmath5 .",
    "the horizontal variable is @xmath6 and @xmath7 is the vertical variable .",
    "@xmath8 is the typical water depth .",
    "the water occupies the domain @xmath9 .",
    "the water is homogeneous ( constant density @xmath10 ) , inviscid with no surface tension .",
    "we denote by @xmath11 the velocity of the fluid , @xmath12 is the horizontal component of the velocity and @xmath13 its vertical component .",
    "the water is under the influence of the gravity @xmath14 and the rotation of the earth with a rotation vector @xmath15 .",
    "finally , we define the pressure in the fluid domain by @xmath16 .",
    "the equations governing the motion of the surface of an ideal fluid under the influence of gravity and coriolis force are the free surface euler coriolis equations    @xmath17    with the boundary conditions    @xmath18    where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 and @xmath22    the pressure @xmath16 can be decomposed as the surface contribution and the internal pressure    @xmath23    with @xmath24 .    in this paper , we identify functions on @xmath25 as function on @xmath26 .",
    "then , the gradient , the curl and the divergence operators become in the two dimensional case    @xmath27 _ _    in order to obtain some asymptotic models we nondimensionalize the previous equations . there are five important physical parameters : the typical amplitude of the surface @xmath28 , the typical amplitude of the bathymetry @xmath29 , the typical horizontal scale @xmath30 , the characteristic water depth @xmath8 and the typical coriolis frequency @xmath31",
    ". then we can introduce four dimensionless parameters    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is called the nonlinearity parameter , @xmath34 the bathymetric parameter , @xmath35 the shallowness parameter and @xmath36 the rossby number .",
    "we also nondimensionalize the variables and the unknowns .",
    "we introduce ( see @xcite and @xcite for instance for an explanation of this nondimensionalization )    @xmath37    in this paper , we use the following notations    @xmath38    we also define    @xmath39    and    @xmath40    notice that our nondimensionalization of the vorticity allows us to consider only weakly sheared flows ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the nondimensionalized fluid domain is    @xmath41    finally , if @xmath42 , we define @xmath12 by @xmath43 .",
    "then , the euler coriolis equations become    @xmath44    with the boundary conditions    @xmath45    in the following we omit the primes . in @xcite ,",
    "a. castro and d. lannes derived a formulation of the water waves equations with vorticity .",
    "we outline the main ideas of this formulation and extend it to take into account the coriolis force ; even in absence of coriolis forcing , our results extend the result of @xcite by allowing non flat bottoms .",
    "first , applying the @xmath46 operator to the first equation of we obtain an equation on @xmath47    @xmath48    furthermore , taking the trace at the surface of the first equation of we get    @xmath49    then , in order to eliminate the term @xmath50 , we have to introduce the following quantity .",
