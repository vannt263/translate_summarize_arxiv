    "the expected gamma - ray flux from the dm annihilation channels was evaluated as a function of energy using the dmfit package  @xcite based on darksusy  @xcite , as implemented in the lat science tools  @xcite . for large dm masses ( around or above @xmath70 )",

    "once the individual sky directions were analyzed , a stacking analysis was performed . in this case the counts from the signal and background regions corresponding to each source were added , and the upper limits on the signal were evaluated following the same procedure as for individual sources .    in order to implement the same analysis procedure as for individual sources , in the stacking analysis the ratio between the signal and background regions was defined as :    @xmath71    where @xmath72 and @xmath73 are respectively the solid angles and the livetimes of the signal and background regions of the @xmath74-th source ( @xmath75 according to the discussion in  [ sec : individualanalysis ] ) .",

    "[ eq : cdef1 ] .",
    "we found that the differences in the values of @xmath54 obtained implementing the two different definitions were negligible in all the energy bins .",
    "the different exposures of the individual sources were also taken into account in the evaluation of the smearing matrix @xcite , which was performed by stacking the pointing histories of all the sources .",
    "this procedure is equivalent to stacking the events from each sky direction on top of one another and then analyzing the resulting image ( as an example see the last panels in figs .",
    "[ fig : countmaps ] and [ fig : countdist ] for the case of the dsph analysis ) .",
    "since the sources may be seen by the instrument with different exposures , the @xmath10-factor value used in the stacking analysis was defined as the average of the @xmath10-factors of individual sources , each one weighted with its exposure in the whole energy interval under investigation . in principle , different @xmath10-factors should be determined for each energy bin , with each one evaluated taking into account the exposures in the corresponding bin .",
    "we performed this calculation in the case of the dsph galaxies , and the differences between the @xmath10-factors evaluated using the exposures in individual energy bins with respect to the @xmath10-factor evaluated using the overall exposure were less than @xmath79 .",
    "since these differences are small , we decided to use the same @xmath10-factor for the whole energy interval , evaluated using the overall exposure . in this way we also avoided introducing an energy dependence of the @xmath10-factor that may seem unphysical since , according to eq .",
    "[ eq : jfactor ] , the @xmath10-factor is determined only by the dm density profile .",
    "the upper limits on @xmath16 were evaluated in the same way as for individual sources .      in the previous analysis",
    "the events from all the sources were stacked .",
    "this is equivalent to considering the set of all the sources as a single source with a @xmath10-factor given by the average value weighted with the exposures of all the sources . in the stacking method",
    "all the sources are treated in the same way , and photons from a source with a small @xmath10-factor are considered as likely to originate from dm as photons from a source with a large @xmath10-factor . however , in the absence of a clear gamma - ray signal , i.e. , if the counts in the signal region @xmath49 are compatible with the expected background ( @xmath80 ) , a source with a higher @xmath10-factor will yield a lower upper limit with respect to a source with a lower @xmath10-factor .",
    "the `` dm sensitivity '' of each source is therefore determined by its @xmath10-factor .    to account for the different sensitivities of each observation we developed a composite analysis approach that combines the results from all the sources taking into account the individual @xmath10-factors . unlike the approaches discussed in sections  [ sec : individualanalysis ] and  [ sec : stacking ] , for simplicity , in this approach we do not treat the energy resolution .",
    "since the @xmath81 containment of the energy resolution of the lat in the energy range chosen for the present analysis is less than @xmath82  @xcite , we expect that neglecting the energy dispersion in the evaluation of the flux could yield a similar uncertainty .",
