    "study of anisotropic flow of particles  @xcite produced in relativistic heavy - ion collisions has emerged as an important tool to probe the early history , especially the thermalization , of the dense fireball produced in these collisions .",
    "anisotropic flow means that the azimuthal distribution of particles produced in non - central collisions , measured with respect to the direction of impact parameter , is not flat .",
    "this is characterized by the fourier harmonics  @xcite : @xmath0 where @xmath1 denotes the azimuthal angle of an outgoing particle , @xmath2 is the azimuthal angle of the impact parameter ( @xmath2 is also called the orientation of the reaction plane ) , @xmath3 is a positive integer , and angular brackets denote an average over many particles belonging to some phase - space region , and over many events . throughout this paper , we assume that colliding nuclei are spherical and parity is conserved : then , the system is symmetric with respect to the reaction plane and @xmath4 vanishes for all @xmath3 .",
    "the two lowest harmonics @xmath5 and @xmath6 are named directed and elliptic flows .",
    "they have been studied extensively over the last several years , with reference to the wealth of data produced at ganil  @xcite , at the darmstadt sis synchrotron  @xcite , the brookhaven alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags )  @xcite , and the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) at cern  @xcite , as well as the new and upcoming data from the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven  @xcite .    since the reference direction @xmath2 is not known experimentally",
    ", measuring @xmath7 is a difficult task .",
    "an alternate idea is to extract it from the interparticle correlations which arise indirectly due to the correlation of each particle with the reaction plane .",
    "however , standard methods of correlating a particle with an estimate of the reaction plane  @xcite , or of correlating two particles with each other  @xcite were shown to be inadequate at ultrarelativistic sps energies  @xcite due to the smallness of the flow , and the comparatively large magnitude of `` nonflow '' correlations  @xcite due to transverse momentum conservation , resonance decays , etc .",
    ", which are usually neglected in these methods . at the higher rhic energies ,",
    "it was argued that nonflow correlations due to minijets could even dominate the measured correlations  @xcite .",
    "these shortcomings of conventional methods motivated the development of new methods based on a cumulant expansion of multiparticle correlations  @xcite .",
    "the cumulant of the @xmath8-particle correlation , where @xmath8 is a positive integer , isolates the genuine @xmath8-particle correlation by subtracting the contribution of lower - order correlations .",
    "nonflow correlations , which generally involve only a small number of particles ( typically , two or three in the case of resonance decays , possibly more in the case of minijets ) contribute little to the cumulant if @xmath8 is large enough . note that this is also true for correlations from global momentum conservation , although the latter involves all particles  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "anisotropic flow is a genuine collective effect , in the following specific sense : in a given event , all azimuthal angles are correlated with the reaction plane azimuth @xmath2 , which varies randomly from one event to the other . in the laboratory frame , where @xmath2 is unknown , this results in azimuthal correlations between all particles , or at least a significant fraction of the particles . therefore , unlike nonflow correlations , anisotropic flow contributes to cumulants of all orders @xmath8 . neglecting the contribution of nonflow correlations to the cumulant , one thus obtains an estimate of @xmath7 , which was denoted by @xmath9 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and becomes more and more reliable as @xmath8 increases .",
    "cumulants of four - particle correlations were first used to measure elliptic flow at rhic  @xcite .",
    "however , it was argued that experimental results could still be explained by nonflow correlations alone  @xcite at this order .",
    "higher - order cumulants , of up to 8 particles , were constructed at sps  @xcite , and provide the first quantitative evidence for anisotropic flow at ultrarelativistic energies . in practice , the cumulant of 8-particle correlations is obtained by evaluating numerically the 8@xmath10 derivative of a generating function . this is rather tedious and numerically hazardous .    in this paper , we propose to study directly the large - order behavior of the cumulant expansion , rather than computing explicitly cumulants at a given order .",
    "correlating a large number of particles is the most natural way of studying genuine collective motion in the system .",
    "furthermore , finding the large - order behavior turns out to be simpler in practice than working at a given , finite order .",
    "as we shall see , the large - order behavior is determined by the location of the zeroes of a generating function in the complex plane  @xcite . in this respect ,",
    "our method is in close analogy with the theory of phase transitions formulated 50 years ago by lee and yang  @xcite : at the critical point , long - range correlations appear in the system ; as a consequence , the zeroes of the grand partition function come closer and closer to the real axis as the size of the system increases .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs here , and anisotropic flow appears as formally equivalent to a first order phase transition .",
    "the idea of studying anisotropic flow through the correlation of a large number of particles is not new .",
    "the same idea underlies global event analyses through a three - dimensional sphericity tensor  @xcite , which led to the first observation of collective flow at bevalac  @xcite . a similar two - dimensional analysis , restricted to the transverse plane  @xcite , led to the discovery of flow at the brookhaven alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags )  @xcite .",
    "with these methods , however , one could not study anisotropic flow differentially , that is , as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity for identified particles .",
    "this is why they were soon superseded by the more detailed , although less reliable , two - particle methods .",
    "one of our important results is that the method presented in this paper also allows one to analyze differential flow , and its implementation is rather straightforward .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [",
    "s : recipes ] we present in a self - contained manner our recipes to calculate the `` asymptotic '' integrated and differential flows .",
    "the derivations of these results are given in sec .",
    "[ s : zeroes ] , where they are related with the lee - yang theory .",
    "the remaining sections are devoted to detailed discussions of the various sources of error .",
    "it is now well known that ( even when anisotropic flow is absent ) `` nonflow '' correlations may give a spurious result when the various techniques of flow analysis are applied . in sec .",
    "[ s : sensitivity ] , we discuss the magnitude of this spurious flow , and show that it is significantly smaller than with any previous method : the main point of this paper is that the present method is the most efficient way to disentangle anisotropic flow from other effects . when anisotropic flow is present in the system ,",

    "finally , four appendices are devoted to further discussions and calculations .",
    "in this section , we show how to obtain an estimate of the flow @xmath7 from the genuine correlation among a large number of particles .",
    "the fact that azimuthal angles of outgoing particles are correlated with the azimuth of the reaction plane @xmath2 allows one to construct in each event a reference direction , which is called an `` estimate of the reaction plane '' in the standard danielewicz - odyniec method  @xcite .",
    "this direction is defined by the flow vector of the event , as recalled in sec .",
    "[ s : flowvector ] .",
    "note that , unlike other multiparticle methods  @xcite , the present one is based on the flow vector . , we propose an alternate version of the present method , which does not make use of the flow vector , but is more time - consuming . ]    the flow analysis then proceeds in two successive steps . the first one is to estimate how the flow vector is correlated with the true reaction plane .",
    "more precisely , we estimate the mean projection of the flow vector on the true reaction plane .",
    "this quantity is a weighted sum of the individual flows @xmath7 of all particles over phase space , which we call `` integrated flow '' and denote by @xmath11 .",
    "the method used to estimate @xmath11 experimentally is described in sec .",
    "[ s : recipeint ] .",
    "this first step is the equivalent of the subevent method in the standard flow analysis , from which one estimates the event - plane resolution . here however , as well as in the cumulant method based on the flow vector  @xcite ,",
    "subevents are not needed .",
    "the second step in the analysis is to use this reference integrated flow to analyze `` differential flow , '' i.e. , flow in a restricted phase - space window ( e.g. , as a function of transverse momentum and rapidity for a given particle type ) , which is the goal of the flow analysis . when analyzing a @xmath12-th harmonic of the differential flow ( @xmath13 )",

    ", with @xmath14 , is to use a flow vector in a lower harmonic @xmath15 .",
    "thus , at sps the sign of elliptic flow @xmath6 is determined using the reference from directed flow @xmath5 , while its magnitude is determined more accurately using the flow vector in the second harmonic  @xcite .",

    "[ s : detector ] and sec .",

    "the first step of the flow analysis is to evaluate , for each event , the flow vector of the event .",

    "the coefficients @xmath26 in eq .  ( [ flowvector ] )",
    "are weights depending on transverse momentum , particle mass and rapidity .",
    "the best choice of @xmath26 is that leading to the smallest statistical error , by maximizing the flow signal .",
    "the weight should ideally be proportional to the flow itself , @xmath27  @xcite . otherwise ,",
    "reasonable choices are @xmath28 , i.e. , the rapidity in the center - of - mass frame , for directed flow , and @xmath29 for elliptic flow .",
    "when comparing events with different multiplicities @xmath24 , one may in addition have weights depending on @xmath24 .",

    ". this quantity was denoted by @xmath48 in ref .",
    "@xcite , and by @xmath49 in ref .",
    "note that unlike the flow coefficients @xmath7 , which are dimensionless , our integrated flow involves the weights present in the flow vector ( [ flowvector ] ) , which can have a dimension . since the flow vector definition involves a sum over all particles , the integrated flow scales like the multiplicity @xmath24 .",
    "with unit weights , @xmath50 where @xmath7 in the right - hand side ( rhs ) is to be understood as an average over the phase space covered by the detector acceptance , and we have neglected fluctuations of the multiplicity @xmath24 for simplicity .",
    "let us now explain how an estimate of @xmath11 can be obtained in a real experiment . for a given value of @xmath41 , we first define the following generating function , which depends on an arbitrary complex variable @xmath51 : @xmath52 where curly brackets denote an average over a large number of events , @xmath53 , with ( approximately ) the same centrality . this generating function has the symmetry properties @xmath54 ( following from @xmath55 ) , and @xmath56^*=g^\\theta(z^*),\\ ] ] where the star denotes complex conjugation .",
