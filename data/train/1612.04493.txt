    "relativistic magnetic reconnection can occur when , as in many high - energy astrophysical environments , the magnetic energy density exceeds the energy density of the ambient plasma ( including the rest - mass energy density ) .",
    "this situation is characterized by a large magnetization parameter @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the ambient reconnecting magnetic field strength and @xmath6 is the relativistic enthalpy density , the sum of the relativistic energy density @xmath7 ( including rest mass ) and the plasma pressure  @xmath8 . when @xmath9 , the ( relativistic ) alfvn velocity @xmath10 approaches the speed of light  @xmath11 , and magnetic reconnection proceeds in the relativistic regime @xcite , leading to ultra - relativistic bulk flows , plasma heating to relativistic temperatures , nonthermal particle acceleration to ultra - relativistic energies , etc .",
    "there are many examples of high-@xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) and medium-@xmath12 ( @xmath14 ) astrophysical environments where relativistic magnetic reconnection is believed to take place , including pulsar magnetospheres , pulsar winds , and pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) @xcite ] ; gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) @xcite ; magnetospheres of magnetars @xcite ; coronae of accreting black holes ( bhs ) in both galactic x - ray binaries ( xrbs ) and active galactic nuclei ( agn ) @xcite , as well as in relativistic jets powered by these systems , including blazars @xcite .",
    "many of these systems are observed to emit nonthermal broadband radiation ( characterized by a power - law energy spectrum ) .",
    "whether quiescent or in the form of bright , impulsive x - ray and @xmath15-ray flares with rapid time variability , such nonthermal radiation is thought to result from energetic electrons ( and positrons , if present ) emitting via synchrotron and/or inverse compton ( ic ) mechanisms ; the energy spectrum of emitting particles is therefore inferred to be nonthermal as well ( a power law , sometimes extending over orders of magnitude in energy ) .",
    "this highlights the importance of understanding the physical mechanisms of non - thermal particle acceleration operating in collisionless energy - conversion processes , of which magnetic reconnection is a leading candidate [ see , e.g. , @xcite for a review ] , taking place in relativistic astrophysical plasmas .",
    "nonthermal particle acceleration in plasma processes has been studied within fluid ( e.g. , magnetohydrodynamic ) frameworks by tracking distributions of passive test particles @xcite . however",
    ", such studies , though valuable in many respects , can not account for the effects of nonthermally accelerated particles acting back on the electromagnetic fields and fluid motions .",
    "these self - consistent effects are likely to be important , especially when the particle energy distributions @xmath16 have power - law indices @xmath17 ( as in ultra - relativistic electron - positron reconnection : * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , indicating that most of the particle kinetic energy resides in particles with energies much higher than average .",
    "because of this , a self - consistent study of nonthermal particle acceleration inherently requires a kinetic approach that evolves the entire particle distribution .",
    "a powerful computational tool often employed in numerical studies of kinetic plasma processes is particle - in - cell ( pic ) simulation .",
    "in particular , there have been a large number of pic studies of relativistic collisionless reconnection in electron - positron pair plasmas in the high-@xmath12 limit in the past few years @xcite .",
    "these studies have concentrated on pair plasmas for two main reasons .",
    "first , some of the most important astrophysical applications of relativistic reconnection involve pair plasmas , most notably pulsar magnetospheres , pulsar winds , and  pwn .",
    "the second reason is the relative simplicity of pair plasma reconnection due to the absence of the scale separation , present in conventional electron - ion plasmas , between the important electron and ion kinetic scales such as the larmor radii , @xmath18 and  @xmath19 , and the collisionless skin depths , @xmath20 and  @xmath21 .",
    "computational advances have allowed the more recent of these pic studies ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to add substantially to our understanding of relativistic pair - plasma reconnection by clearly demonstrating efficient nonthermal particle acceleration and mapping out its quantitative characteristics , such as the power - law index and high - energy cutoff , as functions of the system parameters",
    ".    however , _ electron - ion _",
    "( _ ei _ ) plasmas predominate in many relativistic high - energy astrophysical environments in which magnetic reconnection is believed to be important ( throughout this paper , the ions are protons ) .",
    "for example , _",
    "ei_-plasma reconnection has been invoked as the main mechanism responsible for electron heating and subsequent high - energy radiation in many of the systems mentioned above , e.g. , in accretion disk coronae ( adc ) in black hole systems , in gamma - ray flares in relativistic blazar jets ( and agn jets in general ) , including ultra - rapid tev flares , and for powering prompt emission in  grbs . despite its importance , and in stark contrast to non - relativistic reconnection , relativistic reconnection in _ ei _ plasmas",
    "has so far received relatively little attention ; pic studies of _ ei _ reconnection in the relativistic regime have started only recently @xcite .    when considering ultra - relativistic reconnection in electron - ion plasmas , it is important to note that the key fundamental plasma time- and length - scales , such as the plasma and cyclotron frequencies , the collisionless skin depth , and the larmor radius , become independent of the particle rest - mass and instead depend only on the average particle energy in this ultra - relativistic limit . therefore , if both electrons and ions become ultra - relativistic as a result of magnetic energy release in a reconnection process , then any differences in the dynamical behavior of the two species disappear ( in the absence of radiative losses ) .",
    "correspondingly , one _ a priori _ expects ultra - relativistic _",
    "ei_-plasma reconnection to become essentially similar to ultra - relativistic pair - plasma reconnection , as was indeed confirmed in a recent study by @xcite .",
    "importantly , however , in many real astrophysical plasmas , one finds a more complex and interesting situation  the _ semi - relativistic _ regime  where typical electrons are ultra - relativistic ( with the average lorentz factor @xmath22 ) but ions are sub - relativistic ( @xmath23 ) ; here , @xmath24 is the average kinetic energy of electrons / ions , excluding the rest - mass energy . whether typical ions in the reconnection outflow are expected to be relativistic is governed by the upstream ` cold ' magnetization @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the reconnecting magnetic",
    "field and @xmath27 is the ion density upstream of the reconnection region ; this quantity is basically twice the ratio of the available magnetic energy density to ion rest - mass energy density .",
    "magnetic reconnection in the semi - relativistic regime , characterized by @xmath28 , may be of great importance in , e.g. , accreting black - hole coronae and agn ( including blazar ) jets .",
    "because of the very large separation between the electron and proton rest masses , @xmath29 , the range of applicability of this regime is actually quite broad : it essentially covers three orders of magnitude in  @xmath0 and hence in the expected average dissipated energy per particle , and correspondingly several orders of magnitude in the energy of emitted photons ( since @xmath30 ) .",
    "it is thus critical to understand this new , so far unexplored , reconnection regime , as well as the transition from this semi - relativistic regime to the pair - plasma - like regime of ultra - relativistic ions as @xmath0 increases from @xmath31 to @xmath2 .",
    "we note that , in contrast to our present study , @xcite focused solely on the ultra - relativistic regime , @xmath32 , while @xcite studied greatly reduced mass ratios ( @xmath33 ) with @xmath34 and mildly relativistic electrons , as well as with @xmath35 and barely relativistic electrons .    here",
    "we report the results of our systematic investigation of collisionless _",
    "ei_-plasma magnetic reconnection , using the real mass ratio @xmath36 , from the semi - relativistic through the ultra - relativistic regime  covering the entire range from @xmath37 to @xmath38using the relativistic pic code vorpal / vsim @xcite .",
    "we focus on several important quantitative characteristics of the reconnection process for large system sizes @xmath39such as the reconnection rate , energy partitioning between electrons and ions , hall effect signatures , power - law slopes and cutoff energies of nonthermal particle populations  and study how they scale with the upstream ion magnetization  @xmath0 .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec - sims ]",
    "we describe our numerical simulations , and then present the results in  [ sec - results - dynamics][sec - results - kinetics ] . in   [ sec - results - dynamics ] we discuss the basic fluid dynamics and electrodynamics of reconnection  reconnection rate , plasma flows , and hall effect signatures .",
    "we then describe our findings regarding the energetics and kinetic aspects of the reconnection process in   [ sec - results - kinetics ] , namely , the energy partitioning between electrons and ions , and nonthermal particle acceleration .",
    "after that , in   [ sec - astro ] we discuss some of the most intriguing astrophysical applications of our results , in particular , as a possible natural explanation for ultra - rapid tev flares in agn / blazar jets [ with connections to the minijet model of @xcite ] , as well as the non - flaring emission at lower energies .",
    "finally , in   [ sec - conclusions ] we summarize our conclusions .",
    "our simulations  all two - dimensional ( 2d)of relativistic electron - proton plasma reconnection presented here are performed with the explicit electromagnetic particle - in - cell ( em - pic ) vorpal / vsim code @xcite , using a fully electromagnetic field solver @xcite and a relativistic boris particle - push @xcite with divergence - preserving current deposition @xcite .",
    "the simulations are initialized with an electron - proton plasma , using the real mass ratio @xmath40 , in a double - periodic relativistic harris equilibrium , which is described below in detail .",
    "our investigation focuses on the effects of varying ion magnetization @xmath0 ( defined below ) ; besides describing the setup below , we also relate the initial simulation parameters to @xmath0 .",
    "the fundamental aspects of the initial configuration are the reversing magnetic field and ambient ( background ) plasma . to allow the use of easily - implemented periodic boundary conditions ,",
    "it is convenient to simulate two field reversals ( the so - called double - periodic configuration ) .",
    "as is commonly done , we add a relativistic harris current layer @xcite  a non - uniform , drifting plasma component  at each field reversal to provide current and pressure to balance the reversing magnetic field .    the simulations are conducted in a 2d rectangular computational box with a regular cartesian grid and periodic boundary conditions in both directions . the initial double - reversing magnetic field configuration ( cf . figs .  [ fig : aztimeevolutionsigp1 ] and [ fig : aztimeevolutionsig10 ] ,",

    "thus , our coordinate system places @xmath46 in the direction of the reconnecting magnetic field ( the plasma outflow direction ) , and @xmath47 in the direction of reconnected magnetic field ( the inflow direction , perpendicular to the current layers ) , with the ignorable @xmath48 direction parallel to the initial harris current . for simplicity",
    ", we limit this study to the case without a guide magnetic field component ( @xmath49 , initially ) .",
    "also , unlike most previous double - periodic simulations , our present simulations use a tall box , @xmath50 ( where @xmath39 and @xmath51 are the box sizes in the @xmath46 and @xmath47 directions , respectively ) to reduce interactions between the two layers .",
    "in addition to the two concentrated harris layers , which are described in more detail below , we initially fill the entire box with a low - density uniform and stationary background plasma , described by non - drifting relativistic maxwell - jttner electron and ion distributions with equal initial electron and ion densities , @xmath52 , and temperatures , @xmath53 .",
    "we then characterize the fundamental reconnection setup through the relationships between the upstream reconnecting magnetic field  @xmath26 and the parameters of this ambient background plasma .",

    ", we relate the background plasma temperature to the upstream magnetizations : for all simulations presented here we have chosen @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",
    "these background density and temperature choices yield an initial upstream plasma @xmath59 parameter of @xmath60 , so the upstream region is magnetically dominated .    because @xmath61 is roughly the available magnetic energy per particle",
    ", the ` cold ' magnetizations set the basic scale for average particle energy gain during reconnection .",
    "it is convenient to define a corresponding length scale @xmath62 , where @xmath63 are nominal relativistic electron and ion larmor radii ; thus defined , @xmath64 is the larmor radius of an ultra - relativistic electron with energy @xmath65 ( or , if @xmath2 , of an ion with energy @xmath66 ) .",
    "the corresponding time - scale is @xmath67 . because the larmor radius @xmath64 and larmor period of typical electrons ( after being energized by reconnection ) scale with @xmath0 , simulation grid cell size and timestep are set basically proportional to  @xmath0 , with small adjustments as @xmath0 decreases ( because the scale separation between electrons and ions becomes larger ) .",
    "we note that @xmath64 can also be interpreted as the half - thickness of the current sheet that balances ( via ampere s law ) the jump in @xmath68 equal to  @xmath69 , assuming the sheet has density @xmath70 and drift velocity @xmath71 .",
    "that is , a uniform electron current density of @xmath72 in a layer of total thickness @xmath73 would support a magnetic field discontinuity @xmath74 .",
    "linking the initial upstream temperature to @xmath0 has both advantages and disadvantages .",
    "importantly , it helps to ensure that our simulations are always properly resolved , namely , that the debye length of the background plasma , @xmath75^{1/2}=\\rho_c/20 $ ] , does not become small compared to the grid cell size ( which also scales with @xmath64see below ) .",

    "we emphasize that the fiducial system size @xmath99 is large enough that most of the particles forming the initially - drifting harris sheet have been trapped around the major o - points by the beginning of mid - reconnection .",
    "this can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : ndrift ] , a snapshot of the initially - drifting particle density at the beginning of the mid - reconnection interval for @xmath109 , namely @xmath161 .",
    "therefore , we believe that , during and after the period of mid - reconnection , x - point and plasmoid dynamics ( except when involving the major plasmoid ) are controlled primarily by the upstream ( background ) environment , and are much less influenced by the initial harris sheets .      one of the main quantities of interest in any reconnection study is the reconnection rate , a measure of how rapidly the magnetic flux is transferred from the upstream ( unreconnected ) region to the downstream ( reconnected ) region and , correspondingly , how rapidly the available magnetic energy is converted into plasma energy .",
    "the instantaneous reconnection rate is essentially the time - derivative of the unreconnected flux @xmath156 between the two layers ( times @xmath162 because reconnection proceeds in both layers and we want the rate to be defined as a positive quantity ) .",
    "the corresponding dimensionless instantaneous reconnection rate is then @xmath163 .",
    "however , @xmath164 exhibits both a complex chaotic short - time behavior due to multiple x - points and plasmoid dynamics , and a secular long - time behavior due the exhaustion of the unreconnected magnetic flux and magnetic free energy ( see fig .  [",

    "therefore , constructing a robust and simple measure of reconnection rate requires some care ; in this paper , we characterize ` the ' dimensionless reconnection rate for a given simulation as the normalized time - average @xmath165 during the mid - reconnection interval : @xmath166/(t_{70\\%}-t_{80\\%})$ ] .",
    "this reconnection rate corresponds to a reconnection inflow velocity of @xmath167 and a reconnection electric field @xmath168 ; with yee finite - difference electromagnetics @xcite , @xmath164 is exactly equivalent to the sum of out - of - plane electric fields at the two major x - points ( by faraday s law ) , and so @xmath169 is the average electric field @xmath144 at the major x - points during mid - reconnection .",

    "due to random fluctuations from simulation to simulation and the challenges of making precise measurements , as well as the difficulty of identifying convergence in the limit @xmath199 , we have not been able to conclude with confidence whether the computed power - law indices and cutoff energies are truly independent of @xmath39 for @xmath200 .",

    "we know from electron - positron reconnection studies @xcite that in the ultrarelativistic limit a smaller @xmath82 results in a larger / steeper power - law index  @xmath8 ; however , in the pair case , small @xmath82 means that electrons do not get accelerated very much ( compared to their initial thermal energy ) .",
    "in contrast , electron - ion reconnection can ( e.g. , for @xmath34 ) yield steeper slopes @xmath219 while maintaining @xmath220 ( allowing significant electron acceleration ) .",
    "the ion spectra are harder to characterize , but at high energies there are more ions than electrons with any given energy .",
    "the results obtained in this paper are relevant to a number of astrophysical systems , including accretion disk coronae ( adc ) and blazar jets , which are composed of electron - ion plasma likely undergoing reconnection in the semi - relativistic regime .",
    "the hard x - ray spectra of adc in black - hole x - ray binaries in the high - soft ( hs ) and steep power law ( spl ) states often exhibit relatively steep power - law tails that have spectral indices @xmath221 and extend to well beyond 1  mev @xcite .",
    "this high - energy radiation is generally believed to be produced by inverse - compton ( ic ) scattering of soft x - ray seed photons coming from the accretion disk by a nonthermal population of highly relativistic coronal electrons with an inferred power - law index @xmath222 .",
    "blazars often feature double - humped broad - band spectral energy distributions ( seds ) attributed to synchrotron radiation ( lower - energy component ) and ic scattering ( higher - energy component ) .",
    "there are two main spectral classes of blazars : flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) with synchrotron peaks in the far - infrared range and ic peaks in the mev range ; and high - frequency peaked bl lacs ( hbls ) with synchrotron peaks in uv and x - rays and ic peaks in the gev ",
    "tev range ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "a systematic trend of increasing synchrotron luminosity and increasing compton dominance with decreasing synchrotron peak frequency is known as the blazar sequence @xcite .",
    "typical spectral indices of fsrqs in the x - rays are @xmath223 @xcite , indicating nonthermal distributions of ultra - relativistic electrons with @xmath224 .",
    "to explain the observed seds , these electron energy distributions should extend to @xmath225 in the case of fsrqs and to @xmath226 in the case of hbls .",
    "there are even a few ultra - high - frequency - peaked bl lacs ( uhbls ) that demand @xmath226 , possibly requiring hadronic models @xcite .",
    "the nonthermal electron power - law distributions inferred in these systems have often been attributed to first - order fermi acceleration in strong shocks @xcite , but such a model is viable only if the plasma involved is weakly magnetized .",
    "in contrast , adcs are thought to be strongly magnetized ; the buoyant rise of magnetic energy to form magnetically dominated coronae in accretion disk models with vertical stratification is well - documented in local ( shearing box ) simulations @xcite , suggesting that reconnection is the dominant dissipation and particle acceleration mechanism @xcite . as for blazar jets , the likely importance of magnetic energy out to large distances in these systems",
    "is due to the nature of the hydromagnetic acceleration process , which is efficient as long as the jet is magnetically dominated but becomes extremely inefficient once the kinetic energy and poynting fluxes become comparable @xcite .",
    "jet acceleration can be facilitated by dissipation of magnetic energy , e.g. , through reconnection triggered by current - driven instabilities @xcite .",
    "barring such dissipation , the conversion of poynting flux to kinetic energy would get ` stuck ' at values of @xmath227 .",
    "it is thus interesting to observe that the nonthermal electron distributions with @xmath228 , which emit radiation spectra with @xmath229 seen in adc and blazars , can be produced , according to our simulations , by magnetic reconnection with @xmath230  just the range where substantial dissipation should go hand - in - hand with gradual acceleration of the jet beyond approximate equipartition .",
    "we therefore suggest that reconnection in this semi - relativistic , near - equipartition regime , is a natural way to produce the observed nonthermal spectra in blazar jets , and perhaps in adc as well .    furthermore , adopting our estimated cutoff lorentz factors for the accelerated electrons , @xmath231 , and assuming @xmath232 ( corresponding to @xmath233 and @xmath234 ) for both fsrqs and hbls , we obtain @xmath235 .",
    "this corresponds to a frequency of the observed synchrotron peak @xmath236hz , where @xmath237 is the comoving magnetic field in the emitting region , measured in gauss , and @xmath238 is the doppler boost due to the bulk lorentz factor of the jet , which typically lies in the range @xmath239 @xcite .",
    "fsrqs , with synchrotron peak frequencies extending from as low as @xmath240hz into the uv band , would therefore require low magnetic fields @xmath241 , consistent with the deduction that gamma - rays must be produced at rather large distances from the black hole , @xmath242 , where @xmath243 is the gravitational radius , to avoid excessive pair - production opacity @xcite .",
    "the gamma - rays from hbls , on the other hand , could be produced closer to the jet base ( at @xmath244 ) with corresponding magnetic field strengths @xmath245 .",
    "electron lorentz factors @xmath246 are also consistent with the tev photons being produced by the synchrotron - self - compton mechanism in hbls , in contrast to the mev  gev gamma - rays in fsrqs , which most likely result from comptonization of ambient photon sources @xcite .",
    "in addition to the distributed , and relatively steady , blazar emission discussed above , blazars often exhibit intense , rapid flares in gamma - rays @xcite . to avoid excessive pair production , which would prevent the gamma - rays from escaping",
    ", the flaring regions must have local bulk lorentz factors that exceed the mean for the jet by a factor of a few @xcite .",
    "such ` minijets ' could represent outflow regions from relativistic reconnection sites @xcite , with local values of @xmath0 several times larger than the mean .",
    "we would then predict the spectral slopes to be correspondingly flatter and the cutoffs higher in proportion to @xmath247 ( assuming similar sources of seed photons for comptonization ) .",
    "an additional argument in support of the minijet model follows from our finding ( see  [ sec : plasmaflows ] ) that relativistic reconnection - driven electron fluid flows do not actually require high @xmath0 but readily occur in the semi - relativistic , small-@xmath0 cases as well .",
    "since gamma - radiation is produced by the electrons , the minijet mechanism can thus operate successfully over a broad range of plasma magnetizations , including the @xmath248 regime favored by the observed spectral indices as described above .",
    "finally , we would like to stress the crucial role of the electron - ion plasma composition , in the semi - relativistic limit , for explaining the range of spectral indices typically seen in adc and blazar jets .",
    "kinetic simulations of relativistic reconnection in electron - positron pair plasmas that produce highly relativistic energy cutoffs  necessary to explain the blazar observations ",
    "yield nonthermal electron power - law indices close to @xmath249 @xcite .",
    "while such hard electron distributions may be necessary to explain the most extreme flaring events in blazars , characterized by very flat photon spectra with spectral indices near zero @xcite , they are much too flat to be consistent with most of the regular blazar emission observations , even if one took cooling into account . in contrast , in electron - ion reconnection , electrons are accelerated to ultra - relativistic energies even for modest magnetizations @xmath250 , which , according to our simulation results , are needed to explain the range of spectral indices observed in these systems .",
    "in this paper , we performed a comprehensive numerical investigation of antiparallel ( no guide magnetic field ) collisionless relativistic magnetic reconnection in an electron - ion plasma , relevant to many astrophysical systems , such as coronae of accreting black holes in x - ray binaries and active galactic nuclei , and their relativistic jets , including blazars .",
    "we used a series of large 2d relativistic particle - in - cell simulations with real proton / electron mass ratio @xmath251 to probe various fundamental aspects of reconnection , such as dynamics ( reconnection rate , electron and ion outflows , and hall - effect signatures ) , energetics ( e.g. , the energy partitioning between electrons and ions ) , and nonthermal particle acceleration in different astrophysically - relevant physical regimes .",
    "the main focus of our study was on exploring how these aspects are affected as one transitions from the semi - relativistic regime ( ultra - relativistic electrons but non - relativistic ions ) , which has not been systematically explored before , to the fully relativistic regime ( both ions and electrons are ultra - relativistic ) .",
    "since this transition is quantified by the initial ` cold ' upstream ion magnetization parameter @xmath252 ( basically , twice the average upstream magnetic energy per background ion normalized by the ion rest mass ) , our parameter - space study explored a broad range of  @xmath0 , from very small ( semi - relativistic regime , @xmath253 ; down to @xmath174 in our simulations ) to very large ( ultra - relativistic regime , @xmath2 ; up to @xmath254 ) .",
    "we also explored the dependence of various reconnection characteristics on the system size  @xmath39 ( while keeping the aspect ratio of our computational box fixed , @xmath160 ) , our largest production runs ( for all @xmath0 ) reaching well into the large - system , plasmoid - dominated regime .",
    "our main findings can be summarized as follows .",
    "first , the average dimensionless reconnection rate @xmath255 during the active reconnection phase approaches a constant value @xmath256 in the ultra - relativistic limit @xmath2 .",
    "this value is consistent with previous studies of relativistic electron - positron pair - plasma reconnection @xcite , which is in fact expected since any dynamical differences between ions and electrons disappear in the ultra - relativistic limit ( and in the absence of radiative losses ) and so electron - ion - plasma reconnection should become indistinguishable from the extensively studied pair case .",
    "our simulations also show that as @xmath0 is lowered below @xmath257 , @xmath258 decreases .",
    "this dependence of the reconnection rate on @xmath12 can be attributed almost entirely to the scaling of the upstream alfvn speed @xmath184 with @xmath0 : the reconnection inflow velocity properly normalized to  @xmath184 , @xmath259 , remains essentially constant ( about 0.1 ) across the physical regimes , varying very little as @xmath0 is varied over 3 orders of magnitude .",
    "we also find that the reconnection rate is rather insensitive to the system size for large enough systems .",
    "our simulations also show that , just as in the non - relativistic case , reconnection diffusion regions around x - points develop a two - scale structure in the semi - relativistic regime , with narrow electron current layers embedded in broader ion layers .",
    "interestingly , we find that electron fluid outflows in these electron layers can locally become relativistic , even in the small-@xmath0 cases , when the overall ( ion ) reconnection outflows are sub - relativistic ; however , even for high-@xmath0 , these fluid outflows do not become more than mildly relativistic with lorentz factors of a few .",
    "because the potentially observable radiative signatures are dominated by electrons , this finding may have important astrophysical implications , especially in situations where relativistic motions of the emitting , flaring plasma fireballs are inferred , as in the minijets model for ultra - rapid tev flares in blazar jets  @xcite .",
    "another interesting consequence of the different electron and ion flow patterns in the reconnection region in the semi - relativistic regime is the development of the classic hall - effect signatures near magnetic x - points ( again , similar to non - relativistic electron - ion reconnection ) : the out - of - plane magnetic field @xmath260 with the characteristic quadrupole structure and the corresponding dipolar ( directed into the layer and downstream ) in - plane electric field , which can be described by an electrostatic potential that forms potential wells inside the plasmoids . as one transitions into the ultra - relativistic regime , these signatures weaken , as expected .",
    "we also explored the question of the partitioning of the released magnetic energy between electrons and ions as a function of  @xmath0 .",
    "this issue is important for interpreting astrophysical observations ( e.g. , for evaluating the energy budget of a high - energy flare ) and for computing observational signatures of global mhd simulations of , e.g. , coronae of accreting black holes , since only the electron fraction of the released energy can be promptly radiated away and hence directly observed as a flare .",
    "we found that while the electrons and ions get equal amounts of energy in the ultra - relativistic limit , as expected , the electron energy fraction decreases as @xmath0 is decreased , but eventually seems to asymptote at a finite value of about 1/4 in the semi - relativistic limit .",
    "we then proposed a simple empirical formula [ see eq .  ( [ eq : energypartition ] ) ] that describes this dependence .",
    "finally , we characterized the resulting energy spectra of electrons and ions accelerated by reconnection .",
    "we found that both electrons and ions attain nonthermal distributions by the end of the reconnection process .",
    "in particular , we were able to obtain clear evidence for nonthermal particle acceleration of electrons , manifested as robust power - law energy distributions .",
    "we mapped out the dependence of the electron power - law index @xmath8 and high - energy cutoff @xmath171 on @xmath261 and  @xmath39 , and found that the index becomes fairly insensitive to the system size but exhibits a relatively strong dependence on @xmath0 in the semi - relativistic regime , well - fit by the empirical relationship @xmath262 [ see  eq .",
    "( [ eq : p_e ] ) ] .",
    "the electron cutoff energy is found to scale approximately linearly with @xmath0 , namely , @xmath263 , over several orders of magnitude in @xmath0 , although its scaling with @xmath39 is not completely clear ; a conclusive detailed investigation of this issue is left for a future study . as for ions , based on our present simulations we can not claim a power - law ion energy distributions in the semi - relativistic regime , although in the ultra - relativistic case the ion distribution of course becomes very similar to that of the electrons , with a clear power law .",
    "we believe that our results have important astrophysical implications , e.g. , for high - energy emission from blazar jets .",
    "in particular , the electron power - law indices ( @xmath264 ) that correspond to the nonthermal radiation spectra typically observed in blazars ( @xmath223 ) can be produced by magnetic reconnection with modest ambient magnetization @xmath250 , in agreement with the values that are naturally expected in theoretical models of relativistic jet acceleration .",
    "our present study acts as a bridge connecting two previously extensively - investigated limits : non - relativistic electron - ion reconnection ( usually done in the context of , e.g. , solar flares and earth s magnetosphere ) and ultra - relativistic pair - plasma reconnection ( with applications to , e.g. , pulsar winds and pwn ) .",
    "this research provides baseline knowledge of magnetic reconnection in the astrophysically - important semi - relativistic electron - ion regime , describing the basic dynamics of reconnection as well as resulting particle acceleration , and offering a concrete way to connect theoretical models with astrophysical observations by providing specific fitting formulae for several key parameters of the accelerated particle populations ( such as @xmath265 , @xmath8 , and  @xmath171 ) .",
    "our study also opens up a number of exciting new opportunities that should be explored in the near future ; it will serve as a departure point for more detailed studies of the semi - relativistic regime , including the examination of the effects of guide magnetic field , upstream plasma temperatures , initial configurations other than harris sheets , 3d effects , and synchrotron and ic radiative cooling .",

    "@xmath286 in the boosted frame , @xmath287 thus @xmath288 is an eigenvector of the matrix @xmath289 with eigenvalue @xmath290 ; transforming this eigenvalue equation to the original frame , we see that @xmath7 is an eigenvector of @xmath291 with the same eigenvalue : @xmath292 in the boosted frame , the matrix @xmath289 is block diagonal , with the @xmath293 block consisting of @xmath294 , corresponding to the eigenvector @xmath295 , and the @xmath296 block , which is symmetric and therefore has 3 real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors , which are space - like because they are orthogonal to @xmath297 .",
    "therefore , the matrix @xmath291 also has 4 real eigenvalues , along with one time - like and three space - like eigenvectors .",
    "the time - like eigenvector , if normalized to @xmath298 ( and , if necessary , multiplied by @xmath299 so that @xmath300 ) , yields the landau 4-velocity @xmath7 .    to be clear",
    ", we note that @xmath301 , where @xmath302 is the minkowski metric with diagonal @xmath303 .",
    "it is the non - symmetric matrix @xmath304 , and not the symmetric stress - energy tensor @xmath305 , that must be diagonalized . in the boosted frame , however , @xmath306 is symmetric because @xmath307 is symmetric and @xmath286 .",
    "thus , given a local stress - energy tensor @xmath308 , the landau 4-velocity @xmath7 can be found as follows :    1 .",
    "diagonalize the matrix @xmath304 and find its eigenvectors .",
    "only one eigenvector @xmath7 is time - like ; normalize it so that @xmath309 and @xmath310 ; @xmath7 is the landau fluid velocity .",
    "we have developed a robust procedure to fit the high - energy portion of particle energy spectra to a power - law ; subsequently we can determine the high - energy cutoff of the power - law . essentially , the procedure attempts to identify the longest section of the spectrum @xmath311 that resembles a power law @xmath312 , and then fits a power law to that section only .",
    "[ here , @xmath313 is the particle kinetic energy . ]    because @xmath311 is generally an excellent power - law at very low energies ( the low - energy part of the initial maxwellian)and because we are mainly interested in the nonthermal spectrum ",
    "we look only at @xmath314 where @xmath315 is around the average particle energy ( for this study , we used 1 , 2 , and 4 times the average energy ) .    we begin by smoothing @xmath311 .",
    "empirically , we expect @xmath311 to decrease monotonically above @xmath316 , and so any non - monotonicity indicates noise .",
    "therefore , we find the monotonic function closest to @xmath311 using the pool - adjacent - violators algorithm @xcite , and use this to estimate noise ; that is , we subsequently approximate @xmath311 with the minimal number of cubic splines necessary so that the best spline fit is , on average , no further from @xmath311 than the monotonic fit .",
    "the spline fit yields a smoother @xmath311 .    working with the smoothed @xmath311",
    ", we calculate the local slope @xmath317 , and then , with brute - force , search for the longest interval [ in terms of @xmath318 over which @xmath319 remains approximately constant ( for example , @xmath8 varies at most within @xmath320 or @xmath321 of a central value ) .",
    "we estimate ` the ' power - law index  @xmath8 as the median value of @xmath319 over that interval . after fitting a pure power - law over the same interval",
    ", we calculate the cutoff energy @xmath171 where the measured @xmath311 drops to a value that is @xmath322 times the pure power - law fit .    this procedure for determining a power law",
    "has the advantage that , within the identified power - law section , the local slope @xmath319 does not vary much , and so guarantees that the identified section will really resemble a power - law ( although the procedure might fail to find such a section of reasonable length ) .",
    "however , this procedure depends on several ( somewhat arbitrary though reasonably - chosen ) parameters , such as @xmath315 , the amount of smoothing , and the allowed maximum variation in @xmath319 .",
    "therefore , for each particle spectrum obtained from simulation , we perform many fits with different sets of these parameters , taking the median @xmath8 ( over all fits ) as the final value .",
    "we estimate the robustness by determining the range of @xmath8 that encompasses the middle 68% of the fits , and express this range as ` error ' bars around the median ."
