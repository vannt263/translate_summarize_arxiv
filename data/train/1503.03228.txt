    "@xcite ( focus on classical systems ) and @xcite ( focus on quantum systems ) can be consulted .",
    "these theorems have also been verified experimentally for a variety of classical systems @xcite and have also been used to determine free energy changes in molecular systems by measuring work statistics in controlled non - equilibrium processes @xcite .",
    "further details on this topic are available in the reviews @xcite .",
    "the situation regarding experimental verification of fluctuation theorems for quantum systems is still in its nascent stages .",
    "one central issue in the quantum context is that work is not an observable @xcite ; it is process dependent and therefore the potential values that it may take in a single experiment can not be represented as the eigenvalues of a hermitian operator acting on the hilbert space of the considered system .",
    "this issue underpins the most common approach to determine work statistics for a quantum system , the so - called two - energy - measurement approach ( tema ) @xcite : here the work supplied by a time dependent force @xmath3 during the time interval @xmath14 is defined as the difference between the system s energy at the final and initial times .",
    "the tema can be divided into the following steps : ( 1 ) the system is prepared in a thermal equilibrium state at inverse temperature @xmath6 at @xmath8 with the initial hamiltonian @xmath15 $ ] ; ( 2 ) a projective measurement of energy is performed yielding one of the eigenvalues @xmath16 of @xmath15 $ ] as possible outcome ; due to the measurement the state of the system is projected to the associated energy eigenstate @xmath17 ; ( 3 ) subsequently it undergoes a unitary time evolution during @xmath18 governed by the hamiltonian @xmath2 $ ] which changes in time according to the prescribed protocol @xmath19 ; ( 4 ) at @xmath20 a second projective measurement of energy is performed ; its outcome is an eigenvalue @xmath21 of the final hamiltonian @xmath22 $ ] .",

    "theorems detailed in @xcite , the experimental difficulties of projective measurements were circumvented by encoding the characteristic function of work in the reduced state of an ancillary system that interacts with the system of interest with a strength determined by the force protocol .",
    "an experiment , using nmr spectroscopy , of such a proposal was reported in @xcite . a second way to address",
    "the difficulty of performing projective measurements is to ask if the replacement of the same by non - projective generalized measurements , which may be easier to implement in an experiment , preserves the fluctuation theorems @xcite ( see also @xcite for a recent proposal to measure work as the outcome of a single generalised measurement ) . with this line of enquiry",
    "we found in an earlier publication @xcite a no - go theorem restricting projective measurements of energy as the only ones within a large class of generalized measurements that satisfy both crooks and jarzynski equalities for arbitrary protocols .",
    "although , for some specific forms of the generalized measurements , modified fluctuation theorems may be derived @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on yet another way to address the issue of measurement of work in quantum systems .",
    "conventionally , in classical systems work can be determined in an incremental way by integrating up the supplied power which can be inferred from the instantaneous state of the system @xcite .",
    "a direct extension of such a method to quantum systems is difficult since the system will have to be continuously monitored @xcite .",
    "it is known that a continuous monitoring of a quantum system can cause the freezing of coherent dynamics , a phenomenon known as the quantum zeno effect @xcite .",
    "the central aim of this work is to explore in detail how and why the extension of power measurements to estimate the work done on quantum systems fails to provide work statistics that satisfies the transient fluctuation theorems of crooks @xcite and jarzynski @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : powmeas ] we define the quantum mechanical variable corresponding to the instantaneous power supplied to a system that experiences a force via a coupling to a generalized coordinate .",
    "we introduce an estimate of work computed by incremental projective measurements of the power in conjunction with the protocol , and explain how such an estimate differs from the usual tema based work both in magnitude and range of the possible values . in the limit of frequent measurements ,",
    "the system s unitary evolution is frozen due to the quantum zeno effect ( we refer to such a regime of the dynamics as the  zeno limit \" henceforth ) .",
    "we analyze the statistics of the power - based work in this limit and point out how the commutator of the power operator with the total hamiltonian is crucial in deciding the merits of the work estimate .",
    "we also derive an inequality for the dissipated work estimated by the power measurement in the zeno limit .",
    "further , the results so far obtained are illustrated by the example of a two - level system undergoing an avoided crossing . in section [ sec : jointstat ] , we allow for energy measurements at the beginning and the end of the force protocol additionally to the coordinate measurements necessary for the power measurements and compare the distributions of tema , @xmath24 , and power - based work estimates @xmath25 . in section [ sec : fintime ]",
    "we relax the assumption of projective instantaneous measurements of the power operator and adopt a weak , continuous measurement of power to define the work .",
    "the treatment there is carried out within the framework of stochastic master equations ( sme ) @xcite .",
    "work statistics obtained from numerical solution of smes for the two - level system example are also studied . in section [ sec : conclusion ] we conclude the paper . appendices [ app : genpower ] and [ app : smederiv ] provide additional details omitted from the main text of the paper .",
    "in classical mechanics , the energy - work relation can be invoked to define the work supplied to a thermally closed system as the increase in its energy .",
    "first , let us consider a classical system whose energy is determined by the hamiltonian @xmath26 $ ] where @xmath27 is a point in phase - space and @xmath3 is an external parameter which is varied in time leading to a change in the system s energy .",
    "hence the work done by changing @xmath3 in the interval @xmath14 according to some specific protocol is given by @xcite @xmath28 } - h^{\\mathrm{cl}}{\\left [ \\mathbf{z},\\lambda(0 ) \\right ] } \\label{eq : ediffwclass},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath29 is the solution of hamilton s equation of motion @xmath30},\\mathbf{z } \\right\\}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at time @xmath31 for a trajectory with the initial condition @xmath32 .",
    "( [ eq : ediffwclass ] ) can be rewritten as an integral of the total time - derivative of the hamiltonian which agrees with the partial time - derivative .",

    ", work becomes a random quantity .    in quantum mechanics , both expressions ( [ eq : ediffwclass ] ) and ( [ eq : powintwclass ] ) can in principle",
    "be extended to operational definitions of work which , however , turn out to be no longer equivalent to each other . here , we note that there have been earlier attempts @xcite to define work in quantum systems using expressions analogous to ( [ eq : powintwclass ] ) . in @xcite",
    "this is done in the context of a driven harmonic oscillator interrupted by a small number of measurements of the coordinate and in @xcite the same system is examined under the continuous quantum histories framework for the power operator . in the context of superconducting cooper - pair box systems some lower order moments of a power - based work were considered in @xcite for a closed system and extended to include open systems in @xcite . in some of these attempts @xcite , power - based work has been treated as a standard quantum mechanical observable ( with a corresponding operator ) in contrast to the view point in @xcite , which we adopt .",
    "one central aim of this work is to show that even a more careful implementation of the power - based work for quantum systems taking into account the process dependence will generally lead to qualitatively different statistics from the tema definition of work and generally fail to satisfy the fluctuation relations of crooks and jarzynski .    to that end , we consider the simplest possible situation where a single scalar parameter @xmath3 acts as a force on a system via a generalized coordinate @xmath36 . in the absence of this force",
    "the system is described by the hamiltonian @xmath37 . in the quantum scenario",
    ", the generalised coordinate @xmath36 corresponds to a self - adjoint operator @xmath38 acting on the system s hilbert space .",

    "since the generalised coordinate does not explicitly depend on time , we simply indicate the heisenberg picture by the presence of the time - argument omitting the superscript @xmath42 . in order to determine the power",
    ", one needs to perform a measurement of the generalized coordinate @xmath38 .",
    "the possible measurement outcomes , in a projective measurement @xcite , are determined by the eigenvalues @xmath43 of the generalized coordinate @xmath44 . for the sake of simplicity",
    "we assume that @xmath38 has a non - degenerate discrete spectrum .",
    "hence , the eigenprojection operators @xmath45 are determined by the eigenfunction @xmath46 of @xmath38 . in order to precisely capture the work as the integral of the power one should ,",
    "in principle , continuously measure the generalized coordinate .",
    "this though will inevitably freeze the dynamics of the system in an eigenstate of @xmath38 .",
    "provided that the force protocol is sufficiently slow compared to the unitary dynamics of the system , one can try to avoid the full halt of the dynamics by performing only a finite number of power measurements and approximate the integral by a discrete sum : @xmath47 where we assumed that @xmath48 measurements take place at regularly spaced times @xmath49 with @xmath50 in the interval @xmath51 . the first basic difference between",
    "the power - based and tema work estimates emerges from the varying allowed values of work that the two approaches produce . on the one hand ,",
    "the set of possible tema work values is given by @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the set of indices labelling the spectrum of @xmath54 . here",
    "@xmath55 are operators projecting on the eigenstates corresponding to @xmath56 . comparing with all possible power - based work values having the form given by ( [ eq : workpowbn ] ) , it is apparent that both the number of possible values and magnitudes of work are different in the two approaches .",
    "indeed for a system with finite @xmath57-dimensional hilbert space , the maximum number of possible work values from tema is @xmath58 , whereas in the power measurement case with @xmath48 measurements it is given by @xmath59 . whereas the allowed tema work values are functions of all parameters entering the full hamiltonian ( [ eq : totham ] ) , the power - based work values depend solely on the time - derivatives of the force at the measurement times .",
    "only the probabilities which characterize the occurrence of these work values may depend on the other parameters of the system .",
    "still one could hope that the two estimates of work might be similar in a statistical sense . for this purpose",
    "we now compute the distribution for the work estimate in ( [ eq : workpowbn ] ) to compare it with the distribution of the tema work values in terms of their cumulative probabilities .",
    "beginning at @xmath8 with a canonical density matrix @xmath60}$ ] we obtain for the joint probability @xmath61 of finding the eigenvalues @xmath62 in the @xmath48 measurements at times @xmath63 : @xmath64 where @xmath65 here @xmath66 denotes the time - evolution operator for the system from time @xmath67 to @xmath68 under the influence of the protocol @xmath19 .",

    "we will relax this assumption in appendix [ app : genpower ] and consider generalised measurements of the coordinate . expressing the projection operators in terms of the eigenfunctions of @xmath38 ,",
    "the joint probability becomes : @xmath71 the pdf @xmath72 of finding the value @xmath73 for the power - based work estimate @xmath74 is then given by : @xmath75 for a large number of measurements , the zeno effect @xcite causes a freezing of the system in the state corresponding to the outcome of the first measured eigenvalue of @xmath38 .",
    "this is a consequence of the fact that the transition probabilities @xmath76 between different eigenstates of @xmath38 vanish as @xmath77 .",
    "hence for large values of @xmath48 ( which correspond to small values of @xmath78 ) , the joint probability in ( [ eq : jointprobeig ] ) becomes @xmath79 putting this asymptotic result into the expression in ( [ eq : projfinmeaspowpdf ] ) we obtain @xmath80}x_{\\alpha } \\right ) } { \\left<\\varphi_{\\alpha}\\right|}\\rho_0 { \\left|\\varphi_{\\alpha}\\right > } , \\label{eq : projinfmeaspowpdf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the work pdf neglecting corrections of the order @xmath81 . note that in the above @xmath82 limit , the sum in the delta function specifying the work in ( [ eq : projfinmeaspowpdf ] ) can be replaced by an integral yielding @xmath83}x_{\\alpha_1}$ ] .    having obtained the pdf for the power - based estimate of work , we can immediately check if the jarzynski equality is satisfied .",
    "to that end we have for the average of the exponentiated work the following expression : @xmath84 } { \\hat{x } } } e^{-\\beta{\\left [ h_0 + \\lambda(0 ) { \\hat{x}}\\right]}}}{z(0 ) } \\label{eq : expbetawpowinf}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the jarzynski equality to hold , the numerator of the right - hand side must coincide with the partition function @xmath85}$ ] .",

    "based on the independence of different trajectory simulations we could estimate the inherent statistical error of the work histograms as the sample variance of 100 blocks of 100 trajectories each .",
    "when the measurement strength @xmath248 is small such that @xmath249 , the work estimate ( [ eq : workdefncontlz ] ) is dominated by the noise term and the resulting pdf is approximately gaussian distributed with zero mean .",

    "the system hamiltonian and the initial state are almost diagonal in the diabatic basis giving cumulative probabilities that have sharp jumps at @xmath156 ( low initial temperature ) or @xmath262 ( high temperatures ) .",
    "also in figure [ fig : pardiabkapzeno ] the jumps in the power - based and tema estimates occur at approximately the same values of @xmath73 . we note that this behaviour owes its explanation , as noted in section [ sec : powmeas ] , to the fact that for our choice @xmath122 the magnitude of maximum work possible in tema @xmath263 almost coincides with the location of the jumps in the power measurement cumulative probability .",
    "in summary we find that the work pdf estimated even by weak continuous measurement of the power does not reproduce the behaviour of the tema estimate in general .",
    "for very weak measurement strengths @xmath249 , the estimate is noise dominated and has gaussian behaviour irrespective of @xmath172 and @xmath206 .",
    "when @xmath250 ( strong measurement regime ) the pdf depends on the sweep rate @xmath172 ( for a fixed value of @xmath9 ) which sets the extent to which the total hamiltonian is off - diagonal in the measurement basis .",

    "we considered the statistical properties of work , defined as the integral of supplied power , for a quantum system .",
    "we showed that even a careful definition of work in terms of repeated measurements of the system s instantaneous power leads to a statistics quite different from the usual two energy measurement approach ( tema ) for defining work . in the power - based approach in general even the jarzynski equality or the crooks relation",
    "do not hold . in the limit of a large number of projective measurements of the instantaneous power we found that the quantum zeno effect leads to a freezing of the system s dynamics in the power operator s basis .",
    "the statistics of power - based work in this limit is very different from tema except for the trivial case when the power operator commutes with the system hamiltonian at all times .",
    "furthermore we carried out a detailed comparison of the power - based work and the tema work estimate by considering the joint pdf of both types of work estimates in a setting that combines both approaches .",
    "we obtained a crooks type fluctuation theorem for the joint probability distribution and modified integral fluctuation theorems for the marginal power - based work distribution .",
    "we also studied the correlation between the two estimates of work using the joint probability for the lz problem . finally , relaxing the condition of projective , instantaneous measurements , weak continuous measurement of power was discussed within the formalism of stochastic master equation ( sme ) . using the landau - zener problem as an example , we determined the pdf of power - based work numerically and analysed its properties in the limiting cases of weak and strong measurement strengths .",
    "we found that since the power operator in general does not commute with the total hamiltonian of the system , also within the framework of continuous measurements the power - based estimate is not able to reproduce the qualitative features of the tema work estimate .",
    "finally we would like to note that the treatment of continuous measurements in terms of an sme also leads to a lindblad - type master equation , see ( [ eq : contsmeavg ] ) , similarly as obtained in various recent publications @xcite which are concerned with the definition of work and heat and the quest for fluctuation theorems in open quantum systems .",
    "there , the presence of terms in the equation of motion of the reduced density matrix describing energy - non - conserving effects is caused by the interaction with the environment .",

    "<S> work in the paradigm of quantum fluctuation theorems of crooks and jarzynski , is determined by projective measurements of energy at the beginning and end of the force protocol . in analogy to classical systems </S>",
    "<S> , we consider an alternate definition of work given by the integral of the supplied power determined by integrating up the results of repeated measurements of the instantaneous power during the force protocol . </S>",
    "<S> we observe that such a definition of work , in spite of taking account of the process dependence , has different possible values and statistics from the work determined by the conventional two energy measurement approach ( tema ) . in the limit of many projective measurements of power , </S>",
    "<S> the system s dynamics is frozen in the power measurement basis due to the quantum zeno effect leading to statistics only trivially dependent on the force protocol . </S>",
    "<S> in general the jarzynski relation is not satisfied except for the case when the instantaneous power operator commutes with the total hamiltonian at all times . </S>",
    "<S> we also consider properties of the joint statistics of power - based definition of work and tema work in protocols where both values are determined . </S>",
    "<S> this allows us to quantify their correlations . relaxing the projective measurement condition , </S>",
    "<S> weak continuous measurements of power are considered within the stochastic master equation formalism . even in this scenario the power - based work statistics is in general not able to reproduce qualitative features of the tema work statistics . </S>"
