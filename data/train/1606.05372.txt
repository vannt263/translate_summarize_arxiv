    "since the pionneering work of polder and van hove  @xcite it is well known that the radiative flux exchanged between two hot bodies at subwavelength separation distances can exceed the limit predicted by the blackbody theory  @xcite , thanks to the extra contribution of evanescent waves . in presence of resonant surface modes such as surface plasmons or surface polaritons , collective electron or partial charge oscillations coupled to light waves at the surface",
    ", the radiative - heat exchange can even drastically surpass this limit  @xcite by several orders of magnitude . in the last decade several limits for this enhancement effect were derived  @xcite .",
    "these discoveries have opened the way to promising technologies for near - field energy conversion  @xcite , data storage  @xcite as well as active thermal management  @xcite at nanoscale with thermal rectifiers  @xcite , transistors  @xcite , memories  @xcite , and heat flux splitters  @xcite based on exchanges of evanescent thermal photons .    on the contrary , at long separation distance ( i.e. in the far - field regime ) the transfer of energy between two bodies out of thermal equilibrium results exclusively from propagating waves .",
    "if it is possible to extract the non - radiative waves , which are naturally confined on the surface of materials , using various diffraction mechanisms , the flux exchanged between two media can not go beyond the planck limit when the gap is filled by vacuum as it can be shown in the framework of the landauer formalism  @xcite , for instance .",
    "the situation dramatically changes if a third body is introduced between the two reservoirs .",
    "the reason of this modification is twofold .",
    "first , the presence of a body modifies the optical properties of the medium between the two external bodies : thus , the evanscent waves existing at the interface between each reservoir and vacuum can be coupled to the third body and become propagating inside it .",
    "secondly , the presence of a third body modifies in a more fundamental fashion the heat exchange , since the non - additivity of radiative heat transfer results in purely three - body effects that can hopefully be exploited to amplify the energy flux .",
    "this idea has been recently discussed in  @xcite , where the near - field radiative heat transfer between two bodies has been amplified thanks to the coupling of the reservoirs to a third thin slab placed between them .",
    "connecting a hot reservoir at temperature @xmath0 to a cold reservoir at temperature @xmath1 .",
    "the separation distances between the pipe and the left and right reservoirs are equal to @xmath2 . ]    differently from this last work , our attention is focused on the far field .",
    "we want to understand whether a third invervening body can be exploited to obtain a far - field heat transfer between two external planar slabs going beyond the blackbody limit .",
    "in particular , by choosing dielectric source and sink , we exploit the properties and the anisotropy of hyperbolic materials to produce a heat sink , transporting the near - field energy over distances larger than the thermal wavelength and going therefore beyond planck s blackbody limit .",
    "let us start our discussion with a review of the basics of the radiative heat flux between two semi - infinite reservoirs held at fixed temperatures @xmath0 and @xmath1 , which are connected by thin slab of thickness @xmath3 and temperature @xmath4 as depicted in fig .",
    "[ waveguide ] . between both reservoirs and the intermediate slab is a vacuum gap of thickness @xmath2 . according to the three - body theory of radiative heat transfer  @xcite , which is based on rytov s fluctuational electrodynamics  @xcite ,",
    "the heat flux @xmath5 received in steady - state regime by the reservoir on the right side reads @xmath6 , \\label{flux3b}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 , @xmath8 are the mean photon occupation numbers at equilibrium temperature @xmath9 with @xmath10 .",
    "@xmath11 are the energy transmission coefficients for both polarizations @xmath12 which take into account the contributions of propagating ( @xmath13 , @xmath14 being the component of the wavevector parallel to the slabs ) and evanescent waves in vacuum ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "they are defined in terms of ( optical ) reflection and transmission coefficients of different media as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the normal component of the wavevector , while @xmath18 are the fabry - prot - like denominators . here",
    "@xmath19 and @xmath20 are the fresnel reflection coefficients of the two reservoirs , while @xmath21 are the transmission and reflection coefficient of the intermediate body ( @xmath22 being the corresponding fresnel coefficient corresponding to a semi - infinite medium ) and @xmath23 is the reflection coefficients of the left and intermediate bodies considered as a single entity .",
    "here @xmath24 is the normal component of the wave - vector inside the intermediate body",
    ".    it can be easily checked that if @xmath25 then @xmath26 and @xmath27 so that @xmath28 .",
    "when inserting these expressions the energy transmission coefficients reduce to the well - known expressions of polder and van hove  @xcite for the radiative heat flux between two semi - infinite planar reservoirs separated by a vacuum gap of distance @xmath29 . in this case",
    "( without intermediate slab ) , it is well - known that the radiative heat flux can be larger than that predicted by stefan - boltzmann law when the distance @xmath29 becomes smaller than the thermal wavelength @xmath30 due to the extra contribution of evanescent waves  @xcite . in many different experimental setups",
    "this super - planckian radiation has been verified in the last ten years  @xcite .",
    "the near - field enhanced heat flux or super - planckian radiation is particularly large if both reservoirs have surface phonon polariton resonances in the infrared  @xcite .",
    "this is the case , for instance , for sic and gan , that we will use throughout the paper as examples of sources and sinks .",
    "as anticipated , our aim here is to study how the introduction of a hyperbolic intermediate slab can channel a super - planckian radiative heat flux from reservoir 1 to reservoir 2 over distances which are larger than the thermal wavelength , of the order of @xmath31 for @xmath32 .    to this end , we simplify the discussion by assuming that @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "this corresponds to a situation where we start with the whole structure at equilibrium at temperature @xmath35 and then we heat up @xmath0 by the amount @xmath36 .",
    "this results in a heat flux which is channeled towards reservoir 2 .",
    "if the losses in the intermediate slab are small enough , then the temperature of the intermediate medium 2 will not change , which justifies the assumption that @xmath34 . under this assumption ,",
    "the contribution proportional to @xmath37 in eq .   does not play any role , and we are led to define a heat - transfer cofficient as @xmath38 here @xmath39 is the mean occupation number of the thermal photons at temperature @xmath35 .",
    "this expression , which is only valid for @xmath40 , is much more compact than eq .",
    "( [ flux3b ] ) and it depends only on one temperature @xmath35 . from this expression it becomes obvious that the heat transfer coefficient is quite sensitive with respect to the transmission coefficient @xmath41 of the intermediate slab .",
    "this is so , because @xmath41 determines the properties of the intermediate slab and in particular the eigenmodes inside the slab which can be used to guide or channel the radiative heat flux between both reservoirs . since @xmath42 with @xmath43 it is clear that waves with @xmath44 are exponentially damped along the slab . for large @xmath3 such waves",
    "can therefore not be guided between both reservoirs .",
    "therefore a material with a large permittivity @xmath45 would be ideal for the purpose of heat flux channeling , offering us a wide region of modes of the @xmath46 plane being evanescent in vacuum , while propagating inside our waveguide .",
    "to gain some insight into the mechanism we want to address , we start with the simple case of an isotropic waveguide . for this purpose",
    "we choose germanium , an excellent candidate for two reasons : in the infrared region it has a high dielectric permittivity ( @xmath47 ) and negligible losses .",
    "it thus allows to have propagating modes with lateral wavevectors up to @xmath48 which means that waves with @xmath49 which are thermally excited in reservoir 1 can tunnel into the intermediate ge slab ( if @xmath2 is smaller than the thermal wavelength ) . inside the ge slab these waves are converted to propagating waves which can travel through the ge slab until they reach the second vacuum gap where they can tunnel to the second reservoir .     for sic - ge - sic as function of the thickness of the intermediate germanium slab @xmath3 for a fixed gap distance of @xmath50 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the heat - transfer coefficient is normalized to the blackbody value @xmath53 for @xmath32 . ]",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : gedelta ] the heat transfer coefficient calculated for two sic reservoirs , three different distances @xmath2 and as a function of the thickness @xmath3 of the intermediate slab .",
    "we describe the dielectric properties of sic by means of a drude - lorentz model @xcite @xmath54 with @xmath55 , @xmath56rad / s , @xmath57rad / s and @xmath58rad / s .",
    "we have considered the range of thicknesses @xmath59 .",
    "we have plotted unphysical small values of @xmath60 m just to illustrate the convergence . at such small @xmath3",
    "the heat transfer coefficient @xmath61 converges to the value for two sic reservoirs which are separated by a vacuum gap of thickness @xmath29 . in all the cases considered here ( @xmath62 nm )",
    "this value is of course larger than the blackbody value @xmath63 , showing the super - planckian effect . while this is not surprising for @xmath3 going to zero , since we fully are in a near - field regime , we have to focus on large values of @xmath3 , and remark that for very large @xmath64 ( i.e.  @xmath65 ) the heat transfer coefficient is still larger than the blackbody value although the overall distance is much larger than the thermal wavelength .",
    "this is exactly the waveguide effect we are looking for .    the coupling of the surface polaritons inside the sic reservoirs and the waveguide modes inside the ge slab is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomegakappa ] . in the left column",
    "we have plotted the transmission coefficient of the intermediate slab @xmath66 for the p polarization and in the right column the corresponding energy transmission of the radiative heat flux @xmath67 , choosing @xmath52 .",
    "for a very thin ge slab with @xmath68 the transmission coefficient @xmath69 is very close to 1 for all plotted @xmath70 and @xmath14 . therefore all the waves in this @xmath46 region are nearly perfectly transmitted . as a consequence , the energy transmission @xmath67 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomegakappa](b ) is only slightly different from the energy transmission without the intermediate slab as it could be expected . in this plot",
    "the coupled surface phonon polaritons of both reservoirs can be very nicely seen .",
    "now , when @xmath71 is very large , we find in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomegakappa](c ) that @xmath72 is very large between the light line in vacuum ( @xmath73 ) and the light line in ge ( @xmath74 ) . it should be noted that @xmath66 is much larger than 1 as a result of the poles ( or better resonances ) in @xmath75 which are determined by the condition @xmath76 these are the fabry - prot modes inside the slab .",
    "the surface phonon polaritons as well as the total internal reflection modes of the reservoirs which are between the light lines in vacuum and in ge can couple to these fabry - prot modes , leading to a large transmission for these coupled modes as it can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : geomegakappa](d ) .",
    "in the previous section we have seen that the super - planckian heat radiation can be efficiently channeled or guided through an intermediate slab if this slab supports propagating waves with @xmath77 in a broad frequency and wavevector range . as an alternative to the ge slab we want to study now uni - axial slabs and in particular hyperbolic or indefinite materials  @xcite .",
    "these materials have already been considered for thermal radiation , because they allow for broad - band radiative heat fluxes  @xcite , with a large penetration depth  @xcite in contrast to phonon polaritonic materials  @xcite .",
    "the advantage of hyperbolic materials is that in such materials propagating waves with large wavevectors can exist , a property that can be exploited for hyperbolic lensing  @xcite , for instance .",
    "our goal is now to discuss this hyperbolic lensing for thermal radiation .",
    "since we are looking for an ideal waveguide we will neglect losses ( we actually introduce a very small imaginary part for each component of @xmath78 , equal to @xmath79 ) and dispersion during the discussion . for a real material one has to include losses as well as dispersion .",
    "nonetheless such an idealization helps to find optimal parameters for the heat flux tunneling , which can serve as a basis for the search of a real hyperbolic waveguide structure .    assuming that the optical axis of the uni - axial intermediate slab is along the @xmath80 direction",
    ", we can use the same heat flux expression as before since in this case there is no depolarization  @xcite . we just need to replace the reflection coefficients @xmath81 by the corresponding uni - axial expressions  @xcite @xmath82 with the wavenumbers @xmath83 of the ordinary and @xmath84 of the extra - ordinary waves fullfilling the dispersion relations  @xcite @xmath85 where @xmath86 ( @xmath87 ) is the permittivity parallel ( perpendicular ) to the optical axis .     for sic - hm - sic for different values of @xmath88 and @xmath89 , for @xmath71 and @xmath51 .",
    "the htc is normalized to the blackbody value @xmath53 for @xmath32 . ]",
    "furthermore , it is necessary to replace @xmath90 in the expressions for s polarization by @xmath83 and by @xmath91 for p polarization .",
    "therefore , the transmission coefficient for p polarization of the intermediate slab satisfies @xmath92 this implies that only modes for which @xmath93 is a real number can efficiently guide the heat flux through the intermediate slab with large @xmath3 . in order get some more insight we have to study the behavior of @xmath84 in different regions of the plane @xmath94 :    1 .",
    "@xmath95 and @xmath96 : in this case we have a dielectric uni - axial material . for such materials we have propagating waves in the slab for @xmath97 . as a result ,",
    "materials with large @xmath86 are very useful for our purpose .",
    "2 .   @xmath95 and @xmath98 : this is a so - called type - i hyperbolic material . in this material",
    "we can write the wavenumber of extra - ordinary waves as @xmath99 showing that for such materials @xmath84 is real for all @xmath14 , meaning that such materials support propagating waves with arbitrarily large wavevectors .",
    "of course in a real material there will be a cutoff at a given @xmath14 which is determined by the microscopic properties of the structure .",
    "the type - i hyperbolic material is clearly an ideal candidate for our purpose .",
    "@xmath100 and @xmath96 : this is a so - called type ii hyperbolic material . in this case",
    "we can write the wavevector of extra - ordinary waves as @xmath101 therefore @xmath84 is real if @xmath102 .",
    "again we can have propagating waves inside the slab for arbitrary large @xmath14 , at least in principle .",
    "in contrast to the case of a dielectric uni - axial material , it is advantageous to have small @xmath86 in this case .",
    "4 .   @xmath100 and @xmath98 : this anisotropic metallic case has to be treated separately . actually in this case @xmath103 is always imaginary",
    ". therefore all the waves are damped inside the slab .",
    "but this is not the whole story .",
    "actually it can be shown that for the special case where @xmath104 the transmission coefficient of the intermediate slab is  @xcite @xmath105 in the quasistatic limit .",
    "this means that for @xmath104 the evanescent waves are amplified .",
    "this is nothing else than the perfect lens effect found by pendry  @xcite for an isotropic metallic slab with @xmath106 .",
    "the condition @xmath104 is a generalization to the uni - axial case . for the radiative heat flux",
    "this effect has been demonstrated in  @xcite , thus we will not follow this route further .",
    "another reason is that this effect is quite sensitive to losses and metals are typically very lossy so that we can not use that amplification effect for guiding heat radiation .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : heatfluxmap](a ) we show @xmath107 for different combinations of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "first , we observe the existence of several regions where the ratio is larger than 1 , i.e. where super - planckian heat transfer can be indeed guided to far - field distances .",
    "it seems , in particular , that the type - i hyperbolic materials are quite advantageous for heat channeling because one can have large values of @xmath107 in a large parameter range of @xmath86 and @xmath87 .     for sic - hm - sic as a function of the thickness @xmath3 of the intermediate slab for a fixed gap distance of @xmath51 and three different choices of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",

    "fig : slabthicknesstypeiandii ] . in particular , we consider the cases @xmath108 and @xmath109 , corresponding respectively to a type - ii and type - i hyperbolic material , the case @xmath110 describing ge , and compare these results to the case of using a sic slab . in this plot it can be clearly seen that for large @xmath3 the type - i and type - ii hyperbolic materials are better than ge .",
    "moreover , the type - i hyperbolic material is better than type - ii for the chosen parameters . interestingly for a thickness of @xmath111",
    "we find values for @xmath107 which are larger than for @xmath112 indicating an enhancement or amplification effect for the hyperbolic materials ( hyperlens effect ) which does not exist for a ge slab .",
    "this amplification is similar to that found in  @xcite ( perfect - lens effect ) where a thin metallic layer where used .",
    "nevertheless , in this case the total distance @xmath113 between the two reservoirs is still in the near - field regime .    in figs .  [",
    "fig : t1 ] and [ fig : t2 ] we show the plots of @xmath114 and of @xmath67 for the two hyperbolic materials .",
    "the coupling between the surface modes and the fabry - prot modes in the hyperbolic slab can be nicely seen in both figures illustrating the channeling of the surface mode resonances through the hyperbolic waveguide .",
    "note that the slope of the fabry - prot modes in the type i hyperbolic materials is negative which is due to the fact that type - i hyperbolic materials show negative refraction  @xcite .     for gan - hm - gan as a function of the thickness @xmath3 of the intermediate slab for a fixed gap distance of @xmath51 and three different choices of @xmath88 and @xmath89 .",
    "the case of gan is also shown.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    in order to check the robustness of our results with respect to the choice of the reservoirs we calculate the same heat - transfer - coefficient ratio for two gallium nitride ( gan ) reservoirs .",
    "the dielectric properties of gan can again be safely described in the frequency region of interest by means of a drude - lorentz model  @xcite , by choosing the parameters @xmath55 , @xmath56rad / s , @xmath57rad / s and @xmath58rad / s .",
    "we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : gan ] the quantity @xmath115 as a function of the thickness @xmath3 for four different slabs : the two hyperbolic materials considered before , as well as ge and gan itself . as evident from the figure , apart from an overall increased value of the amplification factor , the same kind of conclusions can be drawn .",
    "first of all , also in this case in the limit of large thickness @xmath3 , both hyperbolic materials perform well in guiding modes into the far field and are even better than ge .",
    "morevoer , we observe again the small - thickness peak in the amplification , and the prefernece of type - i over type - ii in the regime of large thickness .",
    "the considerations in the last section were made assuming the ideal case of a dispersion and dissipationless material . as it is well - known , causality demands both dispersion and dissipation which are connected by the kramers - kronig relations .",
    "nonetheless , one can hope to find materials which fullfill the type - i hyperbolic property in the infrared with small dispersion and dissipation in the frequency window which is important for thermal radiation . in order to explore the possibility of a real anisotropic material we consider the very simple case of a multilayer structure where thin slabs ( orthogonal to the @xmath80 axis ) of sic and ge are periodically alternated .",
    "this structure is described by a filling factor @xmath116 , associated to the fraction of sic present in one period .",
    "the case @xmath117 ( @xmath118 ) gives back a standard sic ( ge ) slab . by choosing two sic reservoirs , we hope in this way to exploit both the presence of a phonon - polariton resonance in one of the two materials ( sic ) constituting the intermediate slab which can couple to the resonances of the reservoirs , and the fact that this artificial material can produce anisotropy and a hyperbolic behavior .    before looking at the heat - transfer - coefficient ratio ,",
    "let us check that this structure can indeed produce a hyperbolic behavior . to this aim",
    "we make us of the effective description in terms of an anisotropic dielectric permittivity .",
    "the perpendicular and parallel components of @xmath78 can be connected to the permittivities of sic and ge by means of the following expressions  @xcite , valid for each frequency : @xmath119 the result is plotted for a filling factor @xmath120 in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : sicge ] .",
    "it is clear that the two components @xmath87 ( red line ) and @xmath86 ( black line ) have in some parts of the spectrum opposite sign .",
    "in particular we have a type - ii hyperbolic behavior for lower frequencies ( the red area in figure ) , while we have a type - i hyperbolic region for higher frequencies ( the grey area ) .",
    "based on this observation we have calculated for three different filling factors the heat - transfer coeffiecient for this structure .",
    "the results are presented in the main part of fig .",

    "the inset shows @xmath87 ( red line ) and @xmath86 ( black line ) for @xmath120 , highlighting the hyperbolic regions ( see text).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    several comments are in order .",
    "first of all , we notice that the behavior of this hyperbolic material is non - trivial , in the sense that the heat - transfer coefficient is not always intermediate between the one of sic and the one of ge .",
    "this can be clearly seen around @xmath122 nm .",
    "the heat - transfer coefficient becomes indeed intermediate between the ones of sic and ge for large values of @xmath3 . nevertheless , even if the final super - planckian amplification is lower than the one given by ge alone , we stress the fact that by using a realistic material we still achieve our goal of channeling near - field effects to far field , since the ratio is still larger than 1 .    the main message of the comparison between this analysis and the one performed in sec .  [ secideal ]",
    "is that the presence of losses plays a key role in the existence and amplitude of this phenomenon .",
    "for this reason , we will in the next section go back to the cases considered in sec .",
    "[ secideal ] and realize a quantitative study of the role of losses .",
    "as anticipated , we perform in this section a quantitative study of the role played by the losses of the intermediate slab . to this aim , we focus our attention on the case @xmath109 and introduce on both components of the anisotropic permittivity an imaginary part @xmath123    also in this case ,",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we assume this imaginary part @xmath124 to be constant as well with respect to frequency .     for the sic - hm - sic configuration .",

    "the solid lines correspond to the cases of gan and ge , while the dashed lines are associated with different choices of the imaginary part @xmath124 of the permittivity of the intermediate slab.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the results obtained are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : lossessic ] in the case of sic reservoirs .",
    "we show the case of imaginary part @xmath125 , i.e. the one considered before , and go up to @xmath126 .",
    "we find that the ability of channeling super - planckian radiation on long distances is a very strong function of the losses in the intermediate material .",
    "this is not fully surprising , considering that we want to exploit propagating waves inside the middle slab , and the imaginary part @xmath124 directly determines their typical decay length .",
    "we observe that for @xmath127 the effect is already for @xmath128 m very important so that in this case the hyperbolic waveguide slab performs worse than both sic and ge for far - field distances .",
    "nevertheless , even for @xmath127 we still have a ratio bigger than 1 for the largest @xmath3 considered here , whereas this is not the case for @xmath129 .",
    "finally , we show the same result in the case of two gan reservoirs . also in this case",
    ", we see basically the same trend and a strong transistion in the behavior of our hyperbolic waveguide happens around @xmath127 .",
    "in this work we have investigated heat exchanges by radiation between two hot bodies interconnected in near - field with anisotropic waveguides . we have predicted that a class of hyperbolic media could transport a super - planckian heat flux over separation distances much larger than wien s wavelength . by analyzing the transmission coefficients between these bodies",
    "we have shown that this behavior results from the presence of hyperbolic modes which remain propagating far beyond the light line .",
    "hence , we have demonstrated that provided the exponential damping of these modes due to intrinsic losses of materials is weak the magnitude of heat flux exchanged between two hot bodies can be larger that that one predicted by stefan - boltzmann s law .",
    "we believe that the hyperbolic waveguides could find broad applications in the field of thermal management by allowing the longdistance transport of the huge energy density which is usually confined close to the surface of materials .",
    "however , so far these waveguides have been considered as purely photonic systems .",
    "further works are needed to evaluate the role play by the heat conduction on the heat transport .",
