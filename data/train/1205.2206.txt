    "the trojans are celestial bodies moving on the same orbit as a planet , but around @xmath4 ahead or @xmath4 behind the planet close to the triangular lagrange points @xmath0 ( leading ) or @xmath1 ( trailing ) . by the original definition ,",
    "only those asteroids on the so - called tadpole orbits are `` real '' trojans @xcite .",
    "jupiter is the first planet known to host thousands of this kind of asteroids after the discovering of ( 588 ) achilles in 1906 .",
    "several trojan asteroids around mars were discovered quite lately in 1990s @xcite .",
    "even another ten years later , the first neptune trojan 2001 qr322 was found @xcite to orbit around the @xmath0 lagrange point . and in the august of 2011 ,",
    "the first earth trojan was confirmed @xcite and its dynamics was studied @xcite very recently .",
    "the trojan asteroids are of special interest not only because the dynamics of them is complicated , but also because their origin and evolution may bear important clues to the early history of our solar system .",
    "many studies , e.g. @xcite , have devoted to the dynamics of trojan asteroids around different planets . in recent years , the origin of trojans and the formation of the trojans cloud began to attract more and more attentions @xcite since the very well - known `` nice model '' ( for a review , see for example",
    "* ) about the early history of the solar system regards the existence and property of jupiter trojans as one of the critical evidences of the theory @xcite .    before the discovery of asteroid 2008 lc18 by @xcite ,",
    "six neptune trojans ( nt hereafter for short ) have been observed .",
    "but they are all around the leading lagrange point @xmath0 , about @xmath5 ahead of neptune .",
    "this is partly due to the fact that the trailing lagrange point ( @xmath1 ) is nowadays in the galaxy center direction .",
    "the background stars add difficulty to the discovery of asteroids in this `` shinning '' region . as the first nt orbiting around the @xmath1 point , 2008 lc18 is of particular interest , not only because it is the first member of a possible asteroid swarm in which it resides , but also because a tricky way has been used to block out the strong background light from the galaxy center . following this success , another @xmath1 nt ( 2004 kv18 )",
    "was reported in july of 2011 , adding the number of @xmath1 nts to two . as for orbital dynamics researching ,",
    "these two findings make the first step of confirming the dynamical symmetry between the @xmath0 and @xmath1 points @xcite , and the high inclinations of their orbits ( see table  [ orbele ] ) raise further the fraction of nts on highly - inclined orbits ( so far 3 out of total 8 nts have inclination larger than 25 degrees ) .",
    "both of these two points bring specific indications to the capturing process of nts and the evolution of the planetary system in the early stage @xcite .",
    "meanwhile , the new horizons probe will travel through the sky region around neptune s @xmath1 point in a few years , thus the study of this region is even more important than the one around @xmath0 .",
    "people meet difficulties in explaining the estimated 4:1 high inclination excess among the population of nts @xcite .",
    "investigations on their dynamics show that the inclination of nts is not likely excited _ in situ _ under the current planetary configuration .",
    "the only acceptable explanation seems to be that the nts are captured rather than formed _ in situ _ , and the capture progress pumped up the trojans orbits , resulting in both high inclination and high eccentricity @xcite . on the other hand , the nt orbit with",
    "eccentricity larger than 0.1 seems to be unstable , thus the nts excited in the early days of the solar system should have been expelled from the trojan cloud @xcite .",
    "this is the critical puzzle in the `` capture origin '' scenario .",
    "except for the newly found asteroid 2004 kv18 , all other nts have eccentricities below 0.1 . the highly eccentric orbit ( @xmath6 )",
    "makes it so peculiar .",
    "can it be the `` smoking gun '' to support the capture origin of neptune trojan cloud ? or , it is not a remnant from the original dynamically excited trojan cloud , but just a passer - by on its journey from the trans - neptune region to the inner interplanetary space .",
    "we take great interest to explore its dynamical properties to find some clues .    in this paper",

    "[ lcini ] .",
    "the orbits are numerically simulated using the hybrid algorithm from the _ mercury6 _",
    "package @xcite .",
    "for the asteroid 2004 kv18 , 1000 clone orbits are integrated up to 10  myr in both forward ( to the future ) and backward ( to the past ) directions .",
    "the integration time span ( 10  myr ) is chosen after some test computations , and it is long enough to show the behavior of the asteroid as being an @xmath1 neptune trojan .",
    "in fact , according to the results in our previous papers @xcite , the orbit of an nt can be stable only when its eccentricity is smaller than 0.12 .",

    "note that we did not show the dynamical map at the section of the exact inclination @xmath15 , but we had the maps for @xmath16 in the paper and for @xmath17 not presented in the paper , and the continuity helps us draw the above conclusion .",
    "we have removed those clones whose semimajor axes exceed 100au in our simulations , because they have been practically ejected from the solar system . by the end of the integration ( 10myr ) , 569 clones out of the total 1000 in the forward integrations , and 558 in the backward integration , survive ( stay in the solar system ) .",
    "the leftovers , however seem all on the very chaotic orbits and we believe they will escape the solar system some time . since our interests in this paper are mainly in the fate of the asteroid as a neptune trojan , we track the variable @xmath18 defined as : @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the mean longitudes of the clone and neptune , respectively .",
    "so @xmath18 is the critical argument of the 1:1 mean motion resonance ( mmr ) between the clone and neptune . for an @xmath1 trojan , @xmath18 librates around @xmath22 ( or equivalently @xmath23 ) .",

    "if the amplitude gets larger resulting in @xmath25 , the asteroid may still stay in the 1:1 mmr but turn to a `` horseshoe orbit '' .",
    "it is not a `` trojan '' anymore according to the original definition @xcite . and",
    "if @xmath18 circulates , the asteroid leaves the 1:1 mmr .",
    "we define the time @xmath26 , when for the first time @xmath18 goes beyond @xmath27 in our simulations , as the moment of a clone escaping from the trojan cloud .",

    "this orbital instability is consistent with the conclusion drawn from locating the nominal orbit on the dynamical maps in our previous papers @xcite .     when the clones leave the @xmath1 trojan region ( see text ) , while the curves with open circles represent the distribution of @xmath28 when the clone escape from the 1:1 mmr . ,",

    "clearly the orbits are chaotic , as the initially close - to - each - other orbits at time @xmath39 become separated quite soon .    in the top panel ,",
    "we see that the resonant angle @xmath18 librates for several periods in both forward and backward directions before it s libration amplitude increases beyond @xmath40 where the clone turns to the horseshoe orbit .",

    ", the clone may have different experiences before it s final escaping from the 1:1 mmr .",
    "it may librate with an amplitude larger than @xmath40 , moving on a horseshoe orbit ; it may shift to the tadpole orbit around the @xmath0 point and become a leading trojan ; and it may behave like a retrograde satellite around neptune with @xmath18 librating around @xmath49 with a small amplitude .",
    "the nominal orbit and another highlighted orbit in fig .",
    "[ kvorb ] show clearly some of these possibilities . in a word ,",
    "the asteroid 2004 kv18 is an @xmath1 neptune trojan right now , but probably it was and will be in the @xmath0 trojan cloud , and it may change its identity several times in the time duration of being in the 1:1 mmr .    when a clone is on the tadpole orbit ( either around the @xmath1 or @xmath0 point ) , its orbital evolution is more or less regular in this regime . for example , in the time range from @xmath50kyr to 70kyr , the nominal orbit is an @xmath1 trojan orbit as indicated by @xmath18 s behavior , and we find its semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination all behave regularly , as shown in fig .",
    "[ kvorb ] . for another highlighted orbit ( blue curves in fig .",
    "[ kvorb ] ) , the tadpole stage is from @xmath51kyr to 140kyr ( @xmath1 first and @xmath0 later , shifting at @xmath52kyr ) , again the regular evolutions in @xmath53 and @xmath9 can be clearly recognized .",
    "but the regular motion must be a transient phenomenon , because the orbit locates on the separatrix of the 1:1 mmr .",
    "this region is characterized by strong chaos induced by overlaps of the secondary resonances ( see for example * ? ? ?",
    "moreover , comparing the orbital elements with the resonance map in our previous papers ( figure 11 in @xcite and figure 5 in @xcite ) , we see that the 2004 kv18 may be strongly influenced by a combined resonance characterized by @xmath54 , where @xmath55 and @xmath56 are the frequencies of the resonant angle @xmath18 and the quasi 2:1 mmr between neptune and uranus , and @xmath57 is the apsidal precession rate of saturn .",
    "as soon as the clone leaves 1:1 mmr , the orbital evolution will be very chaotic .",
    "this chaos arises from the overlap of one - order mmrs in the close vicinity of a planet s orbit @xcite . meanwhile , because neptune and uranus are very close to the 2:1 mmr , some clones will enter the 2:1 mmr with uranus immediately after it escapes the 1:1 mmr with neptune .",
    "in fact the nominal orbit is in the 2:1 mmr with uranus from 70kyr to 170kyr when its @xmath37 librates around 30.7au with a small amplitude , as shown in the second panel of fig .",
    "[ kvorb ] .    due to the strong chaos ,",
    "it is hard to predict precisely the long - term fate of the clones after they escape from the 1:1 mmr , or inversely in time , to trace back their origins before being capturing into this 1:1 mmr .",
    "however , we can still make some informative statistics on their evolutions as follow .",
    "based on the behaviors of two variables , namely the semimajor axis @xmath37 and resonant angle @xmath18 , we divide the clone orbits into seven categories :    * tadpole orbits , td for abbreviation * horseshoe orbits , hs for abbreviation * retrograde satellite , rs for abbreviation * centaurs , ct for abbreviation * transneptunian objects , tno for abbreviation * passing by orbits , pb for abbreviation * ejected objects , ej for abbreviation    actually , the first three all belong to co - orbital motions .",
    "they have similar @xmath37 , but differ from each other by the libration center of @xmath18 : @xmath58 for td , @xmath59 for hs , and @xmath49 for rs . as for centaurs and tnos ,",
    "our definition is not so rigid as in common sense . for a clone whose @xmath18 does not librate",
    ", we simply check if its semimajor axis is larger or smaller than the upper or lower boundary of trojan semimajor axis .",
    "this boundary is estimated through @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 represent the amplitudes of @xmath37 and @xmath18 , respectively , and @xmath63 is the semimajor axis of neptune . here",
    "the angular boundary @xmath62 is set to be @xmath64 according to our previous study @xcite , and the upper and lower boundaries of @xmath37 are then defined by @xmath65 .",
    "the orbits located out of the upper boundary are regarded as tnos , while cts are those inside the lower boundary .",
    "if in a watch window the semimajor axis of a clone excurses both sides of the trojan boundaries , it is assigned to the pb category . and finally , those with semimajor axis larger than 100au are regarded as being ejected from the system .",
    "we set the watch window to be 50kyr , covering about 5 full librating periods of a tadpole orbit . over the 10myr s duration of our simulations",
    ", ten evenly distributed windows are set .",
    "we check the 1000 clones in every window and the statistical results are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ kvcat ] .",
    "the forward and backward integration give more or less the same results in fig .",
    "[ kvcat ] .",
    "note that though we find rss when closely examining the orbits , no rs appear in fig .",
    "[ kvcat ] .",
    "generally the rs phase for a clone orbit lasts only for a very short duration , and it can not be recognized by our numerical categorization code . on one hand , we need longer window width to assure the orbits type ; on the other hand , we need shorter time interval to avoid type mixing in a window",
    ". surely such a dilemma also causes deviations to other categories , but not too much .    as fig .",
    "[ kvcat ] shows , the number of pbs and all coorbital orbits ( td and hs ) decreases with time , indicating that these orbital types are only temporary phases , and not likely to be the final destiny of 2004 kv18 . while the portion of tnos and cts seem not change much after @xmath66yr , implying that they may be the potential final destinies for 2004 kv18 .",
    "since the number of cts is smaller than that of tnos , and this number decreases slightly with time , we argue that it s more possible that 2004 kv18 was ever and will end as a tno than as a centaurs .",
    "at first glance , the asteroid 2008 lc18 is more like a typical nt than 2004 kv18 , because it has a small eccentricity . locating the nominal orbit @xmath67 at epoch jd=2449200.5 on the dynamical maps in our previous papers ( figure  3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we know that it is on the edge of stable region . the _ spectral number _ ( sn ) of it is @xmath68 .",
    "this sn is nearly the same as the ones for the @xmath0 nts , 2005 to74 and 2001 qr322 , but is larger than the sns for other four @xmath0 nts ( 2004 up10 , 2005 tn53 , 2006 rj103 and 2007 vl305 ) .",
    "so the stability of 2008 lc18 is comparable to 2005 to74 and 2001 qr322 , whose orbits have been discussed in our previous paper @xcite . as a matter of fact , in the paper reporting the detection of 2008 lc18 , @xcite mentioned that all the orbits of known nts by then ( seven nts except for 2004 kv18 ) `` are stable for the age of the solar system '' . on the contrary ,",
    "2004 kv18 just discussed in previous section , has an @xmath69 , indicating a very chaotic thus unstable orbit .",
    "the orbit of 2008 lc18 is less precisely determined compared to 2004 kv18 , as indicated by the larger @xmath13 variations in table  [ orbele ] . using the same method for 2004 kv18 ,",

    "[ lcini ] we show the dependence of the lifetimes ( @xmath26 ) of clone orbits on the initial conditions .",

    "[ lcini ] , nearly all the clones that escape in the first stage have initial resonant angles either @xmath89 or @xmath90 . the clones escaping in the second stage on the other hand have @xmath91 .",
    "in fact , as the dynamical maps in our previous papers ( figure 3 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) show , the stable region is separated from the unstable region by a sharp edge , i.e. the intermediate area is very narrow .",
    "thus it s natural to see that those orbits initially locating in the unstable region escape quickly making the quick decrease in the first stage in fig .",
    "[ orbnum ] , while those orbits in the stable region escape slowly in the second stage .",
    "we believe that 2008 lc18 is a typical nt rather than a temporary nt like 2004 kv18 .",
    "further observations will reduce the uncertainties of the orbit and probably exclude those unstable clone orbits escaped in the first stage .",
    "then the decay in the second stage will give the `` proper '' surviving probability of this objects in the @xmath1 region .",
    "moreover , for those orbits initially in the stable region , their orbital elements may diffuse very slowly on the dynamical map and the instability can set in `` abruptly '' when the orbit crosses the narrow transitional area .",
    "such an example of sudden escape from the @xmath1 region is shown in the following section .",
    "we have shown in the above section the ensemble behavior of clone orbits , and we will turn to the evolution of individual orbits now .",
    "but in fact , the orbital evolution of clones of 2008 lc18 is plain . as an example",
    ", we illustrate in fig .",
    "[ lcorb ] the temporal evolution of the nominal orbit of 2008 lc18 .    ) , semimajor axis ( @xmath37 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath38 ) and inclination ( @xmath9 ) of the nominal orbit of 2008 lc18 .",
    "note the break in abscissa axis . ]    from the behavior of resonant angle @xmath18 in the top panel of fig .",
    "[ lcorb ] , the nominal orbit will leave the @xmath1 trojan region in about @xmath92gyr , and it was captured to the @xmath1 tadpole orbit about @xmath93gyr ago . during its being an @xmath1 trojan , the semimajor axis , eccentricity and inclination behave very regularly , varying with small amplitudes .",
    "particularly , the amplitude of @xmath18 is smaller than @xmath94 in most time of its life .",
    "no apparent secular variations of @xmath95 or @xmath18 can be observed in the time range when it is on the tadpole orbit as a trojan .",
    "as we mentioned above , the chaos seems to set in suddenly .",
    "this is due to the fact that the border between the stable and unstable region is narrow , a small deviation from the stable region may result in destroying of the stability .",
    "actually , all those stable orbits that survive on the tadpole orbits in both time directions for 4gyr behave in a similarly regular way as the nominal orbit in the trojan phase from @xmath96gyr to @xmath92gyr .",
    "their semimajor axes oscillate between 29.98au and 30.4au , their eccentricities are always smaller than 0.12 , their inclinations librate around @xmath97 with amplitudes smaller than @xmath98 , and their resonant angles librate around @xmath22 with amplitudes @xmath99 .",
    "the second panel of fig .",
    "[ lcorb ] shows that the semimajor axis of the nominal orbit was beyond the orbit of neptune before it was captured into the trojan cloud , and it will be inside neptune s orbit after it leaves the @xmath1 region .",
    "therefore , it had become a nt from a scattered transneptunian objects ( tno ) and it will turn to a centaurs finally in future . however , it is worth noting that we may draw conclusions from our calculations about the destiny of these clones 4gyr later in future , but no solid conclusions can be made about their origins 4gyr ago in the past .",
    "the solar system currently is quite `` clean '' , but 4gyr ago the orbits of planets probably had not been settled down and the planetesimal disc or even the gas disc still existed .",
    "even though the computing error ( roundoff error and model error ) could be ideally controlled and ignored absolutely , the origin of a nt can not be determined by tracing back its orbit through backward integration , because the exact circumstances at that time are far from being understood .",
    "although the eccentricity of 2008 lc18 is small ( @xmath100 ) , its inclination is quite high ( @xmath101 ) , suggesting a typical excited orbit .",
    "the high inclination of some nts is an important puzzle and perhaps also a key clue for the understanding of their origins and orbital evolutions .",
    "based on our calculations for those 1000 clones , we discuss in this part the excitation of nt orbits , particularly , we will check the possibility of inclination being pumped up _ in situ_.    the resonant maps ( figures 5 , 6 , 7 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) reveal that numerous secular resonances involve in the orbital dynamics of nts , even in the stable region of the orbital elements space .",
    "the effects of these resonances may be not so strong that the orbital stability of nts may not be destroyed in the age of the solar system .",
    "but they may drive the orbits of nts to diffuse slowly in the elements space , so that a primordial nt may attain the high inclination through this slow diffusion . to clarify wether",
    "this process is responsible for the inclination of 2008 lc18 , we examine the eccentricity variation @xmath102 and inclination variation @xmath103 of clone orbits during the simulations . here",
    "@xmath102 and @xmath103 are the full varying ranges of eccentricity and inclination , defined as the differences between the maximal and minimal values of @xmath38 and @xmath9 in the whole simulations .",
    "the results are summarized in fig .",
    "[ varei ] .",

    "it is an enlargement of the lower left corner of the left panel , indicated by an arrow ( see text ) .",
    ", height=245 ]    in the left panel of fig .",
    "[ varei ] , clone orbits are divided into two separated groups .",
    "one group extends from @xmath104 to @xmath105 , and the other one is confined in a small area at low @xmath102 and low @xmath103 , indicated by the arrow in the picture .",
    "we pick out all the stable orbits surviving 4gyr in our simulations in both integration directions and plot their variations of @xmath38 and @xmath9 in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ varei ] .",
    "apparently , the above mentioned group of orbits locating in the lower left corner of the left panel just consists of those stable orbits exactly .",
    "so , all the stable orbits have small eccentricity and inclination variations , i.e. @xmath106 and @xmath107 . for those stable orbits ,",
    "the inclination neither decreases significantly in the backward integration nor increases in the forward integration . hence the inclination of 2008 lc18",
    "seemingly has not arisen under the current configuration of the solar system .    however , those unstable orbits occupy the lower right half of the left panel in fig .",
    "[ varei ] , reflecting that most of them experience large eccentricity variations .",
    "a carefully examining on the orbits reveals that the eccentricity variation is caused either by crossing through mmrs ( between clones and planets ) or by close encounters of the clones with planets .",
    "and both of these two mechanisms work only when the clones are outside the trojan phase .",
    "generally , the increased eccentricity of a clone will result in further close encounters with planets .",
    "the inclination may obtain large variation in these encounters . that is the reason why large inclination variation is always accompanied by large eccentricity variation . on the contrary ,",
    "the lack of orbits in the upper left region of the picture shows clearly that no inclination excitation could happen without the eccentricity excitation .    to the question of whether the inclination of 2008 lc18 can be excited _ in situ _ , our calculations give a negative answer .",
    "but our calculations suggest that during the capturing of asteroids into the trojan orbits , their inclinations might be pumped up , mainly through close encounters with planets . after the capturing",
    ", there must be some braking mechanisms that can damp down the eccentricity but preserve the inclination .",
    "the trojan cloud around the triangular lagrange points @xmath108 of neptune is believed to be a large reservoir of asteroids , hosting more asteroids than jupiter s trojan cloud or even the main asteroid belt between mars and jupiter @xcite . up to now , six leading neptune trojans around the @xmath0 point and two trailing ones around the @xmath1 point have been discovered .",
    "the dynamics of the @xmath0 nts have been studied in literatures by several authors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in this paper , taking into account the errors introduced in the observations and orbital determinations , we investigate the orbital dynamics of two trailing nts , 2004 kv18 and 2008 lc18 .",
    "starting from clouds of clone orbits around the nominal orbits , we simulate the clones orbital evolutions using the well - known _",
    "mercury6 _ numerical integrator package .",
    "our results suggest that 2004 kv18 is on an especially unstable orbit .",
    "it is neither a primordial nor a permanent nt , but rather a passer - by object on its way of exchanging between a tno and a centaurs .",
    "its lifetime as a trailing nt is in the order of @xmath109years in the future , and probably it has been on such a unstable tadpole orbit only for less than @xmath110years .",
    "such an unstable orbit means that it can neither be regard as the smoking gun of `` the hot trojan '' from the chaotic capture model @xcite nor from the migrating neptune model @xcite .    due to the strong chaos suffered by the orbits , it is hard to draw solid conclusion about where the asteroid came from and where it will go in the long term . but statistics on the clone orbits still give some helpful information , suggest that most probably it will evolve to be a tno after its leaving the @xmath1 region .    the asteroid 2008 lc18 however is more like a primordial trailing neptune trojan .",
    "our calculations show that an appreciable proportion of clone orbits within the limits of orbital errors survives on the tadpole orbits for 4gyr and their orbital evolutions are very regular in both forward and backward time directions .",
    "particularly , the high inclination of the orbit does not change much , implying that the orbit has not been excited on the tadpole orbit under current planetary configuration . on the contrary , for those clone orbits escaping from the tadpole orbit",
    ", their inclinations may vary significantly when they are outside of the trojan phase .",
    "these calculations imply that the 2008 lc18 may be captured onto current high - inclined orbit very long ago , and during the capturing process its inclination may be excited due to close encounters with planets .",
    "the orbital stability of clones of 2008 lc18 apparently depends on the semimajor axis and the resonant angle .",
