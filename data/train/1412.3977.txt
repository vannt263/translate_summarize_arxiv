    "quantum field theory in a curved spacetime predicts that the gravitation field creates particles and antiparticles .",
    "the main related phenomena are the hawking effect in black holes and particle creation due to the cosmological expansion @xcite . in the latter case",
    "the creation is caused by the time dependence of the background metric which in turn causes a nontrivial time evolution of the ground state similar to what happens to a quantum harmonic oscillator with time - dependent frequency @xcite .",
    "the process of particle creation depends only on the particulars of the metric and particle properties ( mass , spin etc . ) irrespective of whether the expansion is of cosmological or another origin .",
    "in particular , particle creation is expected in time - dependent analog gravity systems such as expanding bose - einstein ( be ) condensates @xcite , bose and fermi superfluids @xcite , and expanding hadronic fluids @xcite .",
    "analog gravity has proven to be useful in studying various physical phenomena @xcite , e.g. , acoustics @xcite , optics @xcite , superfluidity @xcite , black hole accretion @xcite , and hadron fluid @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to study in the framework of analog gravity the phenomenon of cosmological particle creation in a hadronic fluid produced in high energy collision experiments .",
    "strongly interacting matter is described at the fundamental level by a non - abelian gauge theory called quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) . at low energies ,",
    "the qcd vacuum is characterized by a nonvanishing expectation value @xcite : @xmath0 ( 235 mev)@xmath1 , theso - called chiral condensate .",
    "this quantity describes the density of quark - antiquark pairs found in the qcd vacuum and its nonvanishing value is a manifestation of chiral symmetry breaking @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the linear sigma model @xcite combined with a boost invariant bjorken - type spherical expansion @xcite .",
    "the linear sigma model serves as an effective model for the low - temperature phase of qcd @xcite . in the chirally broken phase ,",
    "i.e. , at temperatures below the point of the chiral phase transition , the pions are massless but owing to the finite temperature effects propagate slower than light @xcite .",
    "moreover , the pion velocity approaches zero at the critical temperature .    as in general relativity , a notable manifestation of analog gravity are two effects both having a quantum origin : the hawking radiation and cosmological particle creation .",
    "these two phenomena are similar but appear under different physical conditions .",
    "the hawking thermal radiation is due to the information loss across the apparent horizon whereas the cosmological particle creation generates a quasithermal radiation as a result of time variation of the spacetime geometry .",
    "the hawking radiation takes place only if there exists a trapping ( or apparent ) horizon , whereas the cosmological particle creation takes place with or without a horizon . on the other hand , in any stationary geometry",
    "the cosmological particle creation is absent whereas the hawking radiation is present in a stationary geometry with an event horizon .",
    "besides , if a field theory is conformally invariant there will be no cosmological particle creation .",
    "in contrast , the hawking radiation is present even in the conformal case as long as a trapping horizon exists .",
    "the analog hawking effect has been studied in our previous papers @xcite in the context of an expanding hadronic fluid .",
    "we have demonstrated that there exists a region where the flow velocity exceeds the pion velocity and the analog trapped region forms which then causes the hawking radiation of massless pions .",
    "here we study the effect of cosmological creation of pions in an expanding hadronic fluid in terms of the bogoliubov transformation @xcite and adiabatic expansion @xcite . for alternative approaches to cosmological particle creation",

    "the velocity components in this coordinate frame are @xmath89 , and hence , the new coordinate frame is comoving . using this and ( [ eq218 ] ) from ( [ eq022 ] ) we obtain the analog metric in a diagonal form @xmath90 where",
    "@xmath91 this metric is of the form of a frw spacetimes with negative spatial curvature provided the quantities @xmath7 and @xmath92 are functions of time only .",
    "we could , in principle , convert the metric ( [ eq243 ] ) back to the original coordinates @xmath93 using the inverse of the transformation ( [ eq147 ] ) and proceed with calculations in the laboratory frame .",
    "however , for our purpose it is advantageous to do the calculations in the comoving reference frame mainly for the following reasons .",
    "the original coordinate frame ( or laboratory frame ) is not suitable for thermodynamic considerations since the thermodynamic variables , such as temperature , are always defined in the fluid rest frame or the comoving frame .",
    "besides , as we shall shortly demonstrate , the comoving reference frame yields an analog frw cosmology . hence , from now on we work in the comoving reference frame referring to the proper time @xmath94 simply as the _ time_.    to find the time dependence of @xmath7 and @xmath92 we shall use ( [ eq051 ] ) and the fact that the temperature of the expanding chiral fluid is , to a good approximation , proportional to @xmath95 .",
    "this follows from the fact that the expanding hadronic matter is dominated by massless pions , and hence , the density and pressure of the fluid may be approximated by @xmath96 and @xmath97 for an ideal massless pion gas @xcite . using this and the continuity equation @xmath98 , where the subscript @xmath99 denotes the covariant derivative associated with the background metric ( [ eq218 ] ) , one finds    @xmath100    here @xmath18 is the critical temperature of the chiral transition and @xmath101 may be fixed from the phenomenology of high energy collisions . for example , if we take @xmath102 gev , then a typical value of @xmath103 gev / fm@xmath1 at @xmath105 fm @xcite is obtained with @xmath106 .",

    "the particles associated with quantum fluctuations of the chiral field are pions and sigma mesons .",
    "since the chiral fluid is expanding and the particles experience an effective time - dependent metric , the pions and sigma mesons will be created during the expansion in complete analogy with the standard cosmological particle creation . as a consequence , the pion and sigma - mesons numbers will not be conserved and a vacuum state generally evolves into a multiparticle state . in sec .",

    "we will make use of the asymptotic expressions for @xmath238 . from ( [ eq2016 ] ) and ( [ eq2031 ] ) in the limit @xmath252 we find @xmath259 @xmath260",

    "we obtain the differential equation @xmath264 where the function @xmath198 is defined in ( [ eq2010 ] ) with ( [ eq2011 ] ) . before proceeding to solve ( [ eq4001 ] ) for the analog cosmological model defined by the metric ( [ eq243 ] ) with ( [ eq2108 ] ) and ( [ eq2208 ] ) , it is useful to study three important examples which may be solved analytically .    consider first a conformally invariant field theory , i.e. , for @xmath265 and @xmath266 , in which case there should be no particle creation , as has been argued on general grounds @xcite . indeed , in this case , as may easily be verified , the function @xmath267 is a solution to ( [ eq4001 ] ) for arbitrary @xmath268 and @xmath269 .",

    "in contrast , on account of ( [ eq2032 ] ) the choice @xmath275 would generally yield @xmath276 and hence an unphysical prediction of particle creation for a conformally invariant field .",

    "the spacetime described by the analog metric ( [ eq243 ] ) approaches the milne universe with @xmath88 and @xmath278 .",
    "it is therefore instructive to compare the analog cosmological particle creation with that of the milne universe . in particular , in the milne universe there should be no creation of massless particles since the scalar field satisfies the conformally invariant wave equation . indeed , for @xmath265 the asymptotic solution to ( [ eq4001 ] ) @xmath279 gives @xmath280 , and hence there is no creation of massless particles as in the previous case .",

    "note that the critical coupling @xmath303 contrary to what one would expect since the original sigma model becomes conformally invariant at the critical point .",
    "curiously , @xmath304 would be equal to @xmath305 if the critical exponent @xmath306 were equal to zero , in which case the pion velocity , as given by ( [ eq252 ] ) , would not necessarily vanish at the critical point .    since there is no creation of pions in the limit @xmath277",
    ", it is natural to choose as the initial state the vacuum state vector @xmath307 at some large @xmath221 and evolve equation ( [ eq2014 ] ) backward in time starting at @xmath221 .",
    "the vacuum state satisfies @xmath308 and , according to ( [ eq3001 ] ) , the one - particle state @xmath309 is represented by @xmath310 where the function @xmath311 is defined in ( [ eq2020 ] ) with @xmath312 .",

    "the reason for that is the the sign change of @xmath319 when @xmath286 exceeds the critical value @xmath320 , as predicted by the asymptotic solution ( [ eq4105 ] ) in the vicinity of the critical point . using these numerical solutions we calculate the square of the bogoliubov coefficients @xmath321 as given by ( [ eq2033 ] ) . in fig .",

    "clearly , the departure of @xmath331 from @xmath335 is significant for large @xmath134 because , according to ( [ eq2040 ] ) , @xmath331 falls off asymptotically as @xmath339 in contrast to the exponential decay of @xmath335 .",
    "hence , the calculated quasi - planckian temperature @xmath325 may be regarded as reliable for almost all particles with wave numbers @xmath340 and some particles with @xmath134 above @xmath338 .",
    "the number of particles thermalized at @xmath325 may be estimated by performing the integral in ( [ eq2030 ] ) with the exact planck distribution function given by ( [ eq4004 ] ) with a @xmath134-independent temperature @xmath325 .",
    "the excess of unthermalized particles above @xmath338 may be estimated evaluating the integral from @xmath338 to @xmath341 using the same planck distribution subtracted from the asymptotic expression ( [ eq2040 ] ) .",
    "we find that the proportion of such particles to the total number of thermalized ones amounts to less than @xmath342 at @xmath337 and less than @xmath343 at @xmath344 .    to check how close we are to the adiabatic regime , for each @xmath94 we compare the comoving wave number @xmath134 with the hubble scale @xmath345 .",

    "this prescription involves theso - called kodama vector @xmath363 @xcite which generalizes the concept of the time translation killing vector to nonstationary spacetimes .",

    "in contrast , the analog hawking temperature vanishes at @xmath373 1.1002 @xmath101 at which the analog trapping horizon ceases to exist @xcite .",
    "we have investigated the cosmological creation of pions in an expanding hadronic fluid in the regime near the critical point of the chiral phase transition . in our approach",
    "we have disregarded a possible particle production caused by the self - interaction potential of the scalar field . besides",
