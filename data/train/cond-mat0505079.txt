    "[ fig : model ] described by the time - dependent hamiltonian @xmath2 , where the different contributions correspond to the quantum dots , the leads , and the tunneling coupling to the respective lead .",
    "we disregard interaction and spin effects and assume that intra - dot excitations do not play a role such that each dot is well described by a single energy level .",
    "then , the double quantum dot hamiltonian reads @xmath3 where the fermion operators @xmath4 and @xmath5 annihilate and create an electron in the left and the right dot , respectively .",
    "the on - site energy difference @xmath6 is determined by the static internal bias @xmath7 , the driving amplitude @xmath8 , and the frequency @xmath9 .",
    "typical driving frequencies range up to 100ghz @xcite such that the wavelength exceeds the size of the setup and , thus , the implicitly assumed dipole approximation is well justified .",
    "the leads are modeled as ideal electron gases , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 creates an electron in lead @xmath12 .",
    "the tunneling hamiltonian @xmath13 establishes the contact between the dot levels and the respective lead .",
    "below , we shall assume within a so - termed wide - band limit that the coupling strengths @xmath14 , @xmath15 , are energy independent .",
    "to specify the dynamics , we choose as an initial condition for the lead electrons a grand canonical ensemble at temperature @xmath16 and chemical potentials @xmath17 .",
    "the influence of lead @xmath18 is fully determined by the lesser green functions @xmath19 and the tunnel matrix elements @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "more precisely , these quantities enter the expressions for the current and the noise in form of the correlation function @xmath21 of the fermionic noise operator @xmath22 , where @xmath23)^{-1}$ ] denotes the fermi function @xcite .",
    "henceforth , we consider the case of zero bias voltage with both chemical potentials located midway between the dot levels @xmath1 , i.e. , @xmath24 .",
    "for harmonic driving , the hamiltonian @xmath25 obeys time - reversal symmetry and , hence , each individual scattering process has a time - reversed partner which occurs with the same probability .",
    "thus , it is tempting to conclude that the net current of both partners and , consequently , the pump current vanishes .",
    "this , however , is not the case because the driving enables energy non - conserving scattering . in particular , there exist processes like the one sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model ] : with the leads initially at equilibrium , an electron from the right lead with energy below the fermi surface is scattered into a state in the left lead with energy above the fermi surface . this process contributes to the current .",
    "by contrast , the time - reversed process does not transport an electron because the respective initial state is not occupied .",
    "the net effect is transport of electrons from the lower level to the higher level , i.e. , from right to left .    none the less",
    ", the pump might vanish due to the presence of an additional symmetry , such as generalized parity @xmath26 which relates two scattering processes with identical _ initial _ energies .",
    "their contributions to the current cancel each other @xcite . with equally strong coupling to the leads , @xmath27 , generalized parity is satisfied for @xmath25 at zero internal bias @xmath28 . for finite bias @xmath29 ,",
    "however , this symmetry is broken and , consequently a finite pump current emerges .",
    "moreover , this pump current exhibits resonance peaks including higher - order resonances @xcite .    within our analytical approach ,",
    "we focus on strongly biased situations , @xmath30 , and driving frequencies close to the internal resonances of the double dot , @xmath31 . in this regime ,",
    "the dynamics of the dot electrons is dominated by the second term of the hamiltonian while the tunneling contribution , which is proportional to @xmath32 , represents a perturbation .",
    "consequently , a proper interaction picture is defined by the transformation @xmath33 $ ] with the time - dependent phase @xmath34 this yields the double - dot interaction - picture hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "the transformation @xmath36 has been constructed such that @xmath37 obeys the time - periodicity of the original hamiltonian while all its other energy scales are significantly smaller than @xmath38 .",
    "thus , we can separate time scales and replace @xmath39 within a rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) by its time average @xmath40 with @xmath41 and the effective tunnel matrix element @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath44th order bessel function of the first kind .    while the lead hamiltonian is unaffected by the transformation @xmath36 , the tunneling hamiltonian acquires a time - dependence , @xmath45 .",
    "the lead elimination along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , but here for a time - dependent contact hamiltonian , reveals that the influence of the leads is no longer determined by the noise operators @xmath46 but rather by @xmath47 .",
    "its correlation function @xmath48 depends not only on the time - difference @xmath49 , but also explicitly on @xmath50 .",
    "the latter time - dependence is @xmath51-periodic and is therefore much faster than all other time scales .",
    "hence , we can replace within the rwa the correlation function of @xmath52 by its @xmath50-average @xmath53 where @xmath54\\hbar\\omega\\bigr)\\ ] ] can be interpreted as an effective electron occupation number of the levels in lead @xmath18 . at zero temperature , it exhibits steps at @xmath55 and is constant elsewhere .",
    "the rwa provides a mapping of the originally time - dependent transport problem to a static one with renormalized parameters .",
    "this problem , in turn , can be solved by standard procedures : both the current and the noise power can be expressed in terms of the transmission probability @xmath56 of an electron with energy @xmath57 .",
    "for a two - level system in the wide - band limit , one obtains @xmath58 then , the current defined as the change of the charge in the , e.g. , left lead , is given by the landauer - like formula @xmath59 $ ] ; the corresponding expression for the noise power reads @xcite @xmath60 \\\\ + & [ 1-t(\\epsilon)][f_{{\\mathrm{l}},{\\mathrm{eff}}}(\\epsilon )                  -f_{{\\mathrm{r}},{\\mathrm{eff}}}(\\epsilon)]^2 \\big\\ } .",

    "for the remaining evaluation of the energy integrals , it is important to note that the transmission is practically zero for @xmath64 .",
    "thus , for @xmath65 , the effective electron occupation is constant in the relevant energy range and can be replaced by its value at @xmath66 .",

    "we find that the current exhibits peaks located at the resonance frequencies @xmath86 .",

    "the pump current vanishes proportional to @xmath88 .",
    "for the chosen parameters , the noise power @xmath71 possesses clear minima , each accompanied by two maxima . in the vicinity of the resonance ,",
    "the noise is considerably below the shot noise level @xmath89 ; cf .",
    "[ fig : omega](b ) .",
    "this feature is notably pronounced at the first resonance .",
    "far from the resonances , the current becomes smaller and the fano factor is close to @xmath90 .",
    "the comparison of the numerically exact results with the current and the noise power [ dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : omega](a ) ] leads to the conclusion , that the rwa predicts both the current maxima and the noise minima sufficiently well to employ these expressions for a parameter optimization towards low - noise pumping .",
    "we have already seen that the condition of large current and low noise is met at the internal resonances of the biased double - dot setup .",
    "thus , we can restrict the search for optimal parameters to resonant driving . as a figure of merit for the noise strength we employ the fano factor for @xmath70 @xmath91 which is a function of @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",

    "then , the value @xmath106 is assumed for @xmath107 which means @xmath108 ; this unfortunately implies a vanishing current .",
    "therefore , the central question is whether it is possible to find a driving amplitude providing on the one hand an appreciably large pump current , while on the other hand yielding a noise level close to @xmath109 .",
    "the numerical results depicted in fig .  [ fig : optimizing ] indeed suggest this possibility : the fano factor is close to the optimal value already for a finite amplitude .",
    "a closer investigation reveals that the location of the minimum corresponds to @xmath110 , in compliance with our analytical considerations .",
    "in particular , the minimum is shifted towards smaller values of @xmath111 for weaker coupling @xmath99 . moreover , the rwa solutions and agree very well with the numerically exact results , although they slightly underestimate the noise .",
    "this discrepancy diminishes as @xmath112 ( not shown ) .",
    "the data also reveal that in the interesting regime , the ratio @xmath111 is considerably smaller than 1 and , hence , we can employ the approximations @xmath113 and j@xmath114 valid for small arguments .",
    "it is now straightforward to obtain to lowest order in @xmath111 the expressions @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "for instance , choosing @xmath117 , the noise level lies merely 5% above @xmath109 and the condition @xmath118 corresponds to @xmath119 , i.e. , to weak dot - lead coupling .",
    "this estimate is confirmed by the inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : optimizing ] which , in addition , demonstrates that @xmath120 for @xmath121 .",
    "for such a small coupling @xmath99 , interaction - induced electron - electron correlations typically play a minor role .    in the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite , a typical inter - dot coupling is @xmath122 .",
    "then , an internal bias @xmath84 corresponds to the resonance frequency @xmath123 .",
    "tuning the lead coupling to @xmath124 results in an optimized pump current of the order @xmath125 with a fano factor @xmath126 .",
    "the analysis of ac - driven , asymmetric double quantum dots demonstrates that optimal pumping is achieved beyond the adiabatic regime . in particular , the ideal _ modus operandi _ requires a large internal bias at resonant driving in combination with a strong inter - dot coupling @xmath127 .",
    "the resulting pump current then assumes a maximum while , interestingly enough , the ( absolute ) noise power assumes at the same time a minimum such that the fano factor becomes remarkably small . in order to systematically tune the pump into a low - noise regime ,",
    "we have derived analytical expressions for both the current and its noise power .",
