    "kigami constructed a laplacian for fractal sets , in particular post - critically finite attractors of iterated function systems , as the limit of ( normalised ) difference operators on a sequence of finite graphs , which approximate the attractor , see for instance @xcite .",

    "this approach is motivated by the fundamental theorem of calculus and based on the works of feller @xcite and kac and kren @xcite . in the case that @xmath2 is a fractal set , whereas the previous approaches relied on graph approximation methods , with this new approach such approximations are not required . indeed in @xcite a harmonic calculus of @xmath0",
