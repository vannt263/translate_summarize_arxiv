    "the enumeration of lattice animals is a classical combinatorial problem of great interest in it own right @xcite .",
    "lattice animals are connected subgraphs of a lattice . a _ site _",
    "animal can be viewed as a finite set of lattice sites connected by a network of nearest neighbor bonds .",
    "the fundamental problem is the calculation ( up to translation ) of the number of animals , @xmath3 , with @xmath4 sites . in the physics literature lattice animals",
    "are often called _ clusters _ due to their close relationship to percolation problems @xcite .",
    "series expansions for various percolation properties , such as the percolation probability or the average cluster size , can be obtained as weighted sums over the number of lattice animals , @xmath5 , enumerated according to the number of sites @xmath4 and perimeter @xmath6 @xcite . in mathematics , and combinatorics in particular ,",
    "the term polyominoes is frequently used .",
    "a polyomino is a set of lattice cells joined at their edges .",
    "so polyominoes are identical to site animals on the dual lattice .",
    "furthermore , the enumeration of lattice animals has traditionally served as a benchmark for computer performance and algorithm design @xcite@xcite .",
    "lattice trees form a proper subset of lattice animals , and can be defined as those animals containing no circuits .",
    "another way of defining trees is that a tree is a finite connected set of sites with the property that a walk starting from any given site can not return to the original site without self - intersections .",
    "lattice trees have been suggested as a model of branched polymers @xcite .",
    "lattice animals and trees are expected to belong to the same universality class @xcite and thus have the same critical exponents .    an algorithm for the calculation of @xmath5",
    "has been published by martin @xcite and redner @xcite .",
    "it was used by sykes and co - workers to calculate series expansions for percolation problems on various lattices . in particular sykes and",
    "glen @xcite calculated @xmath5 up to @xmath7 on the square lattice , and thus obtained the number of lattice animals , @xmath8 , to the same order .",
    "redelmeier @xcite presented an improved algorithm for the enumeration of lattice animals and extended the results to @xmath9 .",
    "this algorithm was later used by mertens @xcite to devise an improved algorithm for the calculation of @xmath5 and a parallel version of the algorithm appeared a few years later @xcite .",
    "the next major advance was obtained by conway @xcite who used the finite lattice method with an associated transfer - matrix algorithm to calculate @xmath10 and numerous other series up to @xmath11 @xcite . in unpublished work oliveira",
    "e silva @xcite used the parallel version of the redelmeier algorithm @xcite to extend the enumeration to @xmath12 . in this work",
    "we use an improved version of conway s algorithm to extend the enumeration to @xmath13 .",
    "we also calculate the number of lattice trees up to @xmath14 and the radius of gyration of lattice animals and trees up to @xmath15 .",
    "the quantities and functions we consider in this paper are : ( i ) the number of lattice animals @xmath3 and the associated generating function , @xmath16 ; ( ii ) the number of lattice trees @xmath17 with generating function , @xmath18 ; and ( iii ) the mean - square radius of gyration of animals or trees of size @xmath4 , @xmath19 .",
    "these quantities are expected to behave as    @xmath20 , \\nonumber \\\\ t_n & = & t \\lambda_0^n n^{-\\tau}[1+o(1 ) ] , \\\\ \\langle r^2 \\rangle _ n & = & r n^{2\\nu}[1+o(1 ) ] , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the reciprocals @xmath23 of the critical point of , respectively , the animal and tree generating functions .",
    "from numerical evidence it is well - established that @xmath24 .    in section  [ sec : enum ]",
    "we give a detailed description of the finite lattice method for enumerating lattice animals .",
    "some initial results of the analysis of the series are presented in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "the method we use to enumerate site animals and trees on the square lattice is based on the method used by conway @xcite for the calculation of series expansions for percolation problems , and is similar to methods devised by enting for enumeration of self - avoiding polygons @xcite or the algorithm used by derrida and de seze to study percolation and lattice animals @xcite . in the following we give a detailed description of the algorithm used to count lattice animals .",
    "we then show how to generalise the method to calculate the radius of gyration and obtain series for lattice trees .",
    "the number of animals that span rectangles of width @xmath25 and length @xmath26 are counted using a transfer matrix algorithm . by combining the results for all @xmath27 rectangles with @xmath28 and @xmath29",
    "we can count all animals up to @xmath30 . due to symmetry we only consider rectangles with @xmath31 and thus count the contributions for rectangles with @xmath32 twice .     a snapshot of the intersection ( solid line ) during the transfer matrix calculation on the square lattice .",
    "animals are enumerated by successive moves of the kink in the boundary , as exemplified by the position given by the dashed line , so that one site at a time is added to the rectangle . to the left of the boundary",
    "we have drawn an example of a partially completed animal .",
    "numbers along the boundary indicate the encoding of this particular configuration . ]",
    "the transfer matrix technique involves drawing a boundary line through the rectangle intersecting a set of @xmath25 sites . for each configuration of occupied or empty sites along the boundary",
    "we maintain a generating function for partially completed animals intersecting the boundary in that particular pattern .",
    "animals in a given rectangle are enumerated by moving the boundary so as to add one site at a time , as shown in figure  [ fig : transfer ] .",
    "each configuration can be represented by a set of states @xmath33 , where the value of the state @xmath34 at position @xmath35 must indicate first of all if the site is occupied or empty .",
    "an empty site is simply indicated by @xmath36 . since we have to ensure that we count only connected graphs more information is required if a site is occupied . in short",
    "we need a way of describing which other occupied sites on the boundary it is connected to via a set of occupied sites to the left of the boundary .",
    "the most compact encoding of this connectivity is @xcite    @xmath37    configurations are read from the bottom to the top . as an example the configuration along the boundary of the partially completed animal in figure  [ fig : transfer ] is @xmath38 .",
    "in addition to the configuration of states along the boundary line we also have to specify whether or not the partially completed animals include sites on the lower and/or upper borders of the rectangle .",
    "this can simply be done by marking a configuration with a 0 if none of the borders have been touched , and a 1 , 2 or 3 if , respectively , the lower border , upper border or both borders have been touched . in this way",
    "we can be sure to count only those animals which span a given rectangle in the vertical direction . that all animals span the horizontal direction is ensured by the set updating rules detailed below .",
    "the total configuration of occupied sites and the touching of the borders can be encoded by a pair of integers @xmath39 , where @xmath40 indicates which borders have been touched , and @xmath41 is the integer whose binary representation is obtained by assigning 3 bits to each @xmath34 in the configuration of occupied sites , @xmath42 .",
    "we shall call such a @xmath39-pair a _ signature _ , and in practise represent it by an integer @xmath43 . for @xmath44",
    "a signature can thus conveniently be stored in the computer as a 64-bit integer , while for @xmath45 we need to switch to a more complicated representation , say , in terms of several 16-bit integers .",
    "often we shall explicitly write out the configuration @xmath33 instead of @xmath41 and use the notation @xmath46 to indicate a configuration obtained by concatenating the strings @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the major improvement of the method used to enumerate animals in this paper is that we require animals to span the rectangle in _ both _ directions . in the original approach",
    "@xcite animals were only required to span in the lengthwise direction and animals of width less than @xmath25 were generated many times .",
    "it is however easy to obtain the animals of width exactly @xmath25 and length exactly @xmath26 from this enumeration @xcite .",
    "the only drawback of the new approach is that for most configurations we have to use four distinct generating functions .",
    "the major advantage is that the memory requirement of the algorithm is exponentially smaller .    realizing the full savings in memory usage comes from two enhancements to the original algorithm .",
    "firstly , for each configuration we keep track of the current minimum number of occupied sites @xmath49 which have been inserted to the left of the intersection in order to build up that particular configuration .",
    "secondly , we calculate the minimum number of additional sites @xmath50 required to produce a valid animal .",
    "there are three contributions , namely the number of sites required to connect all the separate pieces of the partially completed animal , the number of sites needed to ensure that the animal touches both the lower and upper boundary , and finally the number of sites needed to extend at least @xmath25 columns in the length - wise direction . if the sum @xmath51 we can discard the partial generating function for that configuration because it wo nt make a contribution to the animal count up to the size we are trying to obtain .",
    "furthermore , for any @xmath25 we know that contributions will start at @xmath52 since the smallest animals have to span a @xmath53 rectangle .",
    "so for each configuration we need only retain @xmath54 terms of the generating functions . with the original algorithm contributions started at @xmath25 because the animals were required to span only in the length - wise direction .      in table  [ tab : update ] we have listed the possible local ` input ' states and the ` output ' states which arise as the kink in the boundary is propagated by one step .",
    "the most important boundary site is the ` lower ' one situated at the bottom of the kink ( the site marked with the second ` 2 ' in figure  [ fig : transfer ] ) .",
    "this is the position in which the lattice is being extended and obviously the new site can be either empty or occupied .",
    "the second most important boundary site is the ` upper ' one at the top of the kink ( the site marked ` 3 ' in figure  [ fig : transfer ] ) .",
    "the state of the upper site is very important in determining the state of the lower site when occupied .",
    "the state of the upper site is likely to be changed as a result of the move .",
    "in addition the state of a site further afield may have to be changed if a branch of a partially completed animal terminates at the new site or if two independent components of a partially completed animal join at the new site . in the following",
    "we give the details of how some of these updating rules are derived .",
    "we shall refer to the signature before the the move as the ` source ' and a signature produced as a result of the move as a ` target ' .",
    ".[tab : update ] the various ` input ' states and the ` output ' states which arise as the boundary line is moved in order to include one more site of the lattice .",
    "each panel contains two ` output ' states where the left ( right ) most is the configuration in which the new site is empty ( occupied ) . [",

    "estimates of the critical point and critical exponent were obtained by averaging values obtained from second order inhomogeneous differential approximants . in table  [ tab : analysis ] we have listed the estimates obtained from this analysis .",

    "note that these error bounds should _ not _ be viewed as a measure of the true error as they can not include possible systematic sources of error . from this",

    "since the @xmath58 estimates from the two tree series are in excellent agreement we claim that the best estimate for @xmath65 is the one obtained from the tree series .",
    "this estimate is consistent with , but much more accurate than , the recent estimate @xmath66 obtained from monte carlo simulations of lattice trees @xcite .",
    "it is also consistent with the estimate @xmath67 obtained using phenomenological renormalization to lattice animals @xcite .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the animal series was performed in @xcite .",
