    "radial velocity ( rv ) and transit detections of extrasolar planets have been a watershed for observational studies of planet formation , compiling a sample of planets large enough ( @xmath1400 to date ) for statistical studies .",
    "however , these discoveries provide an incomplete picture of the extrasolar planet population : most rv planets are detected only indirectly and with the @xmath2 ambiguity in their masses , and transiting planets are mostly restricted to very small orbital separations .",
    "direct imaging of exoplanets can measure colors , luminosities and spectra , thereby providing temperatures and compositions . furthermore , since rv and transit studies are confined to the inner regions of other solar systems ( @xmath36 au for 15-yr survey ) , we know very little about the planetary constituents in the outer regions of other solar systems , where gas - giant planets are born .",
    "the discovery of extrasolar planets by direct imaging ( ) has opened the door to a whole new realm of observational study .",
    "analogous to the growth of rv and transit studies , the next steps in the field of direct imaging will be to move from individual `` headline '' discoveries to well - defined , well - studied samples to glean the properties of the whole population .",
    "moreover , detailed photometric and spectroscopic analysis of new exoplanet discoveries will allow us to dissect the atmospheric properties and thermal evolution of these objects ( e.g. , ) .",
    "in principle , the largest ( 810  meter ) ground - based telescopes equipped with adaptive optics ( ao ) could be effective for direct imaging of planets , as these platforms achieve the highest possible angular resolution in the near - ir with a filled aperture telescope .",
    "however , traditional ao imaging is hampered by the time - variable nature of the point spread function ( psf ) and the presense of quasi - static point - like speckles in the images .",
    "thus while ao greatly enhances the contrast ( i.e. , the ability to detect faint sources next to bright ones ) , its imperfect correction is a severe limitation to push to planetary masses and separations .",
    "this challenge can be overcome with specialized instrumentation .    _ , title=\"fig:\",width=403 ] 0.2 in -0.1 in 2ex",
    "-1ex    the near - infrared coronagraphic imager ( nici ) is a powerful ao instrument tailored to direct detection of extrasolar planets through high contrast imaging ( * figure  [ fig : nici ] * ) .",
    "it is the first instrument on an 8 - 10  meter telescope designed expressly for such work .",
    "nici was built by mauna kea infrared in hilo , hawaii ( pi doug toomey ) and funded by nasa .",
    "the instrument is now fully operational at the gemini - south 8.1-meter telescope@xcite .",
    "nici combines a suite of capabilities to achieve high contrast imaging : ( 1 )  an efficient natural guide star curvature ao system built by the university of hawaii , ( 2 ) spectral differential imaging ( sdi ) ; ( 3 ) angular differential imaging ( adi ) ; and ( 4 ) lyot - style coronography .",
    "while these techniques have been used in previous instruments , nici is the first to bring all of them together into a single instrument .",
    "nici was designed as a complete end - to - end system for high - contrast imaging , minimizing both the wavefront phase distortions from the atmosphere , telescope and instrument as well as the internal instrumental scatter .",
    "nici first creates a high strehl image ( @xmath03045% at @xmath4-band ) with its own internal low - scatter 85-element curvature ao system .",
    "its wavefront sensor is tailored to the range of natural guide star brightnesses needed for the planet - finding campaign ( @xmath5  mag ) . unlike most other ao systems to date , the corrected ao beam is reflected into the science channel and the first transmissive element is the focal - plane mask . the ( warm ) focal plane mechanism offers several choices of circular translucent masks , all with flat - topped gaussian transmission profiles and central attenuations of order 0.5% .",
    "the masks effectively boost the dynamic range of the detector , allowing us to accurately determine the position and flux of the central star relative to any faint companion candidates .",
    "nici s internal ( cryogenic ) pupil mechanism allows for several hard - edged stops , which help to remove psf artifacts associated with the edges of the gemini - south secondary mirror . following the focal - plane mask and pupil stop , the beam is divided with a 50/50 beam - splitter into two imaging channels that are read out simulataneously .    _ , width=480",
    "]    2ex    for ages of @xmath6100  myr , ultracool ( @xmath7  k ) objects with near - ir photospheric  absorption correspond to masses of @xmath612  according to evolutionary models ( e.g. , ) , and hence  absorption is expected to be a characteristic signature of young planets . ir imaging of young planets in and out of this absorption band will produce a unique photometric signature , strong emission in the blue band and little emission in the red one , that can be distinguished from the bright ( methane - free ) glare of the parent star @xcite .",
    "the sdi approach was first attempted with the trident camera on cfht @xcite and has also been used for the sdi cameras on the vlt and mmt @xcite .",
    "similar to these instruments , nici provides time simultaneous methane - band imaging in order to counteract the time - variable ao psf .",
    "nici implements sdi through dual - channel imaging design , with each channel being an independent optical channel with its own @xmath8 aladdin insb detector ( * figure  [ fig : dualchannel ] * ) .",
    "the spectral properties of the @xmath4-band on+off methane filters in nici were custom designed to maximize the combination of sensitivity and accurate sdi subtraction , based on an end - to - end simulation of the expected imaging performance ( see ) .",
    "the resulting filters are 4% wide , with central wavelengths of 1.578  ( off - methane ) and 1.652  ( on - methane ) .",
    "nici can also employ adi ( a.k.a .",
    "roll subtraction ; ) to distinguish between long - lived telescope+instrument speckles and faint astronomical objects , thereby removing the psf and achieving higher contrast .",
    "altogether , nici offers a number of imaging options , through the use of adi , sdi , or both ; this versatility makes it novel compared to other previous ao instruments .",
    "for instance , dual - channel data obtained with adi+sdi mode can also be summed , instead of differenced as in the sdi processing , to yield a pseudo - broadband adi dataset .",
    "likewise , the instrument can be used in single - channel adi - only mode , where an internal mirror is used to send all the light to one detector , thereby maximizing the throughput . _",
    "nici s versatile imaging configurations make it sensitive to very faint companions , both with and without photospheric methane absorption . _",
    "to take full advantage of the powerful capabilities of nici , we are leading a three - year guaranteed - time campaign at the gemini - south 8.1-meter telescope dedicated to finding and characterizing planets by direct imaging .",
    "the campaign is designed to address three key questions in the study of gas - giant extrasolar planets :    1 .   *",
    "_ what is the frequency of outer ( @xmath9510  au ) massive planets around other stars ? _ * determining the incidence and properties of outer planetary companions will allow us to develop a complete picture of exoplanetary configurations .",
    "to this end , one major goal of the nici campaign is to probe the mass and separation distribution ( @xmath10 ) of planets at distances as close as @xmath1510  au , as inferred from the complete set of nici detections ( discoveries ) and non - detections .",
    "this distribution may have profound consequences for assessing the dominant formation mechanism of gas - giant planets .",
    "* _ what is the dependence of planet frequency on the stellar host mass _ * ?",
    "the frequency of giant planets in the outer regions of low - mass stars ( m  dwarfs ) is another key discriminant between the two competing theories of giant planet formation , namely core accretion and disk instability . by design ,",
    "the campaign is searching for planets around young stars over a wide range of masses , from spectral type b7 to m6 .",
    "this is feasible thanks to the sensitivity of nici s curvature - based ao system to optically faint stars .",
    "rv surveys find few massive planets in the inner @xmath61  au regions around low - mass stars ( e.g. , ) ; the nici campaign will be a complementary study of the outer regions around these objects .",
    "* _ what are the spectrophotometric properties of young extrasolar planets _ * ?",
    "follow - up multi - band photometry and spectroscopy of directly imaged planets will test theoretical models , which are far from mature .",
    "the discovery space is large and unexplored .",
    "cooling models may be incorrect or missing key opacity sources .",
    "indeed , one of the early surprises from rv discoveries was the diversity of exoplanet orbits .",
    "whether this diversity extends to their spectral energy distributions ( seds ) is an important open question .",
    "initial studies of the seds of the hr  8799 planets point to unusually cloudy , non - equilibrium photospheres compared to field brown dwarfs , suggesting extreme physical properties in ultracool atmospheres at young ages ( )",
    ". however , many more systems are needed for study .     from 0.0330  au .",
    "the nearest , youngest stars are favored , though more nearby , slightly older stars can be better targets than younger stars farther away . [",

    "the nearest , youngest stars are favored , though more nearby , slightly older stars can be better targets than younger stars farther away . [",
    "fig : simulations]_,title=\"fig:\",width=288 ]    to achieve these goals , the nici campaign is mostly targeting nearby young ( @xmath6300  myr ) stars , where planets are expected to be hot enough and luminous enough for direct detection at near - ir wavelengths .",
    "one added virtue of nici is that it is deployed at gemini - south .",
    "while numerous young stars have been recognized in the last 510  years all over the sky , the most promising of the currently known moving groups reside in the southern hemisphere ( e.g. , ) .",
    "we also carried out complementary efforts to identify previously unrecognized young stars as targets prior to the start of the campaign , focusing on low - mass stars ( m  dwarfs ) within 25  pc@xcite .",
    "the current young star census is mostly restricted to higher - mass ( afgk - type ) stars and contains few m dwarfs .",
    "this paucity is striking , especially considering that m dwarfs dominate the stellar mass function by number : m  dwarfs comprise @xmath070% of a volume - limited census ( e.g. , ) . to find this `` missing '' population , we used x - ray activity+color selection to identify candidates and high - resolution optical spectroscopy to refine their age estimates , through gravity - sensitive indices , strong h@xmath11 , lithium , and @xmath12 space velocities .",
    "the vast majority of our m  dwarfs are not in any previously published young star sample , illustrating the novelty of our search .    to select and prioritize targets , prior to the start of the campaign we employed monte carlo simulations to evaluate the science return of different approaches : deeper vs. shallower exposures ; more vs.  fewer targets ; younger , more distant targets vs. older , closer targets , etc .",
    "our approach is based on the methods developed by nielsen et al .",
    "( e.g. , ) .",
    "the ranking of targets is done by simulating a large number of planets ( 100,000 ) around each star , with planets drawn from mass , semi - major axis , and eccentricity distributions consistent with the known rv planet population and null results from previous direct imaging surveys@xcite .",
    "the brightness , age and distance of the host star establish the apparent magnitudes , flux ratios , and projected separations of the simulated planets .",
    "the simulated planets were then compared with the expected nici companion sensitivity to determine what fraction would be detected ( * figure  [ fig : simulations ] * ) .",
    "this approach allows us to understand the trade - offs of the relevant factors : age , distance , host star luminosity , ao performance , exposure times , and overall sample size .",
    "the result is that the best stars can be identified for deep nici imaging , out of thousands of possible targets . in short",
    ", the nici campaign has been designed to maximize the likelihood of detecting planets ; as a natural consequence , this also ensures that even a null result would have profound scientific impact , strongly constraining the possible populations of long - period giant extrasolar planets .",
    "the final campaign target list is composed primarily of stars with ages of @xmath6300  myr and distances of @xmath670  pc .",
    "it does include stars with older ages or larger distances that are promising targets , especially if they have ancillary evidence for being hosts of planetary systems ( e.g. , the presence of circumstellar debris disks ) .",
    "our simulation effort showed that the `` best '' list of stars depends to some degree on the assumed input planet population , especially the adopted outer orbital separation and its dependence ( or lack thereof ) on stellar host mass .",
    "this was not surprising , though the full extent of the effect is perhaps unappreciated in previous such simulations  the choices that go into the modeling inevitably sway the outcome . in the end",
    ", we synthesized the results from simulations with different assumptions , ensuring the broad range of spectral types needed to study the dependence of planet frequency on stellar host mass ( campaign goal # 2 ) .",
    "the final sample is split roughly equally between high - mass stars ( af spectral types ) , solar - type stars ( gk types ) , and low - mass stars ( m type ) .",
    "the campaign began science observations in december 2008 , with monthly observing runs executed in fixed blocks of several nights during bright time .",
    "observations are executed on - site by gemini staff , with real - time remote support by campaign team members via polycom .",
    "most nici observations have been carried out during the chilean summer , from november to april when seeing conditions are favorable for ao imaging .",
    "first - epoch observations for 178 stars have been obtained so far , more than half the campaign goal of 300 stars .    thanks to the extensive on - sky characterization during the commissioning phase and first year of the campaign , we have developed a stable set of observing protocols that are now used for almost all campaign observations@xcite , ensuring homogenous datasets that are directly amenable to prompt pipeline processing and common science analysis .",
    "most targets are observed contemporaneously with two instrument configurations : ( 1 )  a dual - channel adi+sdi mode ( `` asdi '' ) with the 4% 1.6  methane on+off filters and ( 2 )  a single - channel adi - only mode with the regular @xmath4-band filter .",
    "this `` hybrid '' scheme provides the greatest sensitivity over a range of separations .",
    "the asdi mode delivers the highest contrasts in the inner @xmath61.01.5where speckle noise dominates , while the adi - only mode offers the greatest sensitivity to faint companions at larger separations .",
    "each night , we design an observing plan to carefully control the amount of sky rotation for each target ( * figure  [ fig : schedule ] * ) . too much instantaneous rotation during a single adi exposure will lead to too much blurring and thus loss of point - source sensitivity at larger separations .",
    "too little total rotation over the entire observing sequence for a target will make it difficult to construct an appropriate psf for adi data reduction and lead to self - subtraction at smaller separations .",
    "fundamentally , the duration of an observing window is a function of target declination . for objects that transit close to overhead",
    ", these windows can be very brief , sometimes only 10 - 20 minutes long . for more northerly or southerly targets ,",
    "the observing windows are longer , up to several hours in duration , and therefore easier to schedule . given a prioritized list of science targets , we assemble a custom schedule for each night , fitting together the differently sized observing windows for all the targets .",
    "this ensures that objects with difficult ( short ) observing windows will be observed with an optimal rate and total amount of sky rotation .    _ , width=336 ]",
    "data processing and analysis occur immediately during and after each run , providing the feedback on data quality and any potential discoveries needed to plan the next block of observing . with the combined angular+spectral differencing imaging ( asdi ) mode and the adi - only mode .",
    "individual images are scaled , registered , radially aligned , and optimally differenced to subtract the psf halo and speckles from the bright star , thereby revealing any faint , close companions .",
