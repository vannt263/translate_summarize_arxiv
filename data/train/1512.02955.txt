    "although there is a long history of nuclear reaction calculations using three - body models @xcite , the rigorous faddeev - type scattering theory @xcite was practically applied to nuclear reaction problem only in the last decade @xcite . despite being theoretically most complicated and computationally more expensive than traditional approximate three - body reactions methods , the faddeev formalism has an advantage that , once numerically well - converged results are obtained , the discrepancies with the experimental data can be attributed to the shortcomings of the used potentials or to the inadequacy of the three - body model .",
    "the numerical calculations @xcite have been performed using the alt - grassberger - sandhas ( ags ) integral equations for transition operators @xcite that were solved in the momentum - space framework ; the coulomb interaction was included via the screening and renormalization method @xcite .",
    "so far the applications of faddeev / ags equations are limited to three - body systems made of a proton ( @xmath9 ) , neutron ( @xmath10 ) , and nuclear core ( @xmath11 ) . with @xmath11 most often being one of @xmath12 , @xmath5 , @xmath13 , or @xmath6 , reactions initiated by the collisions of the deuteron ( @xmath14 ) with the nucleus @xmath11 and of the proton with the bound system",

    "the @xmath0 process is especially important since it may be used for the creation and study of weakly bound core plus valence proton @xmath23 systems such as one proton halo nucleus @xmath24 .",

    "the standard ags formalism assumes short - range potentials within the three pairs of particles .",
    "this condition is fulfilled by the nuclear interactions @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 that , in the odd - man - out notation , denote @xmath9-@xmath10 , @xmath10-@xmath11 , and @xmath11-@xmath9 potentials , respectively . however , the proton - core coulomb repulsion @xmath29 , in the coordinate space given as @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the charge number of nucleus @xmath11 and @xmath32 the fine structure constant , is of the long range .",

    "the two - body transition operators , when iterated to all orders via ags equations , lead to the three - body transition operators .",
