    "correlated percolation@xcite is a useful theoretic model in statistical physics .",
    "it provides us with fundamental understanding of spread processes of message , disease and matter in nature and society . linking probability between any two nodes in it takes the form of @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is @xmath6-dimensional distance between the nodes , and",
    "@xmath0 is a positive real number , namely , distance - decay exponent of links .",
    "weinrib and halperin@xcite analytically studied whether the correlations change the percolation behavior or not .",
    "weinrib@xcite pointed out , for @xmath7 , the correlations are relevant if @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the percolation - length exponent for uncorrelated percolation ; while for @xmath10 the correlations are relevant if @xmath11 .",
    "it is a generalization of the harris criterion@xcite appears earlier .",
    "recently , network models referring to correlated percolation have gradually appeared@xcite .",
    "achlioptas process(ap)@xcite for link - adding networks , which is an attractive topic at present@xcite , could be viewed as a new kind of correlated percolation if we put all nodes uniformly on a two - dimensional(2d ) plane .",
    "starting from a set of isolated nodes , two candidate links are put to nodes randomly at every time step , but only the link with smaller product @xmath12 is retained , where @xmath13(or @xmath14 ) is the mass ( the number of nodes ) of the cluster that node i(or j ) belongs to , which is called product rule(pr ) . a link chosen with pr from both inter - cluster candidates is called a type - i link .",
    "when two candidate - links are of different types , i.e. , one is an inter - cluster link , the other is a intra - cluster one , always the later is retained , and it is called a type - ii link . while for both intra - cluster ones , the retained link is arbitrarily chosen no matter they are in the same or different clusters , and it is called a type - iii link . generally speaking , in the way of ap , network percolation",
    "is inhibited , which postpones the appearance of the threshold @xmath15 at which a giant component g starts to grow , and results in a sharp growth of g called an explosive percolation . in our point of view , if we put ap on a 2d plane , it gives rise to a new mechanism of long - range correlation for the nodes based on co - evolutionary growing masses of components they connected .",
    "the selective rule for topological links relies on mass - product instead of 2d geometric length of them , which prevents the property exhibited in the previous correlated percolation . and",
    "correlation feature in ap - type of percolation has not been revealed up till now .    a recent model of ours@xcite based on the observation of phenomena in different real systems@xcite describes another kind of correlated percolation in growing networks , which could be viewed as a overlapping of traditional correlated percolation with ap in a 2d space .",
    "the link - occupation function in the model takes the form @xmath16 which looks like newton s gravity rule .",
    "it resumes the classical erdos - renyi(er ) random graph model when exponent @xmath17 , and it gives another extreme of ap when @xmath18 .",
    "different properties of such kind of new correlated percolation are expected , since er random graph grows without any bias , ap takes a strong bias to inhibit network percolation independent of geometric distance , while the new model with gravity - like rule have some distance - related relax on such bias , which produces a new type of correlated percolation .    in this paper , we report the simulation results on objective competition between type - i , ii and iii links in both gravity model@xcite and ap model , and we point out a new mechanism to support critical points , which bears the scaling relations revealed in our recent work .",
    "different saturation effect is manifested , which distinguishes it from the traditional correlated percolations .",
    "suppose @xmath19 isolated nodes are uniformly scattered on a 2d plane . for convenience of calculating distance ,",
    "the plane is discretized with a triangular lattice , each minimal edge with the length of two units for the convenience of algorithm .",
    "each vertex of the triangles is occupied by a node so that we exclude all possible biases except link - adding rules . for any two pairs of nodes @xmath20 and @xmath21 possibly with the same product @xmath12 , a type - i link connects the the pair with longer distance if both the links ends hit the nodes belonging to different clusters ; while a type - ii link connects the nodes inside the same cluster if the other one is an inter - cluster link ; a type - iii one connects arbitrarily chosen pair of nodes if both candidate links are intra - cluster ones .",
    "parallel to pr , we pick randomly two pairs [ @xmath22 and @xmath23 of nodes in the plane at every time step . for the pair @xmath22 ( and for @xmath24 likewise ) , we calculate the generalized gravity defined by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the geometric distance between @xmath20 and @xmath21 , and @xmath0 is an adjustable decay exponent .",
    "once we have @xmath27 and @xmath28 , we have two choices in selecting which pair to connect . for the case of the maximum gravity strategy ( we call it @xmath29 ) we connect the pair with the larger value of the gravity , e.g. , the link @xmath22 is made if @xmath30 and the link @xmath24 otherwise .",
    "we also use the minimum gravity strategy ( @xmath31 ) in which we favor the smaller gravity pair to make connection .",
    "the two strategies , @xmath32 and @xmath31 , lead the link - adding networks to evolve along the opposite paths of percolation processes . generally speaking , @xmath29 facilitates the percolation process , whereas @xmath31 inhibits it .",
    "all such generalized gravity values are calculated inside the circular transmission range with the radius @xmath1 centered at one of nodes @xmath20 and @xmath21 as the speaking node  @xcite in a mobile ad hoc network@xcite . for the different limits of parameters @xmath1 and @xmath6",
    ", we have three cases in the model .",

    "case iii : with both limited values of radius @xmath1 and exponent @xmath0 , we have the gravity rule inside the transmission range .",
    "it can describe the communication or traffics with constrained power or resources .    for case",
    "i and case iii in the model , three scaling relations have been found with large scale simulations .",
    "when strategy @xmath36 is adopted in 2d free space(case i ) , we have    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is dimensionless time - step with @xmath39 , @xmath0 is the decay exponent of connection probability .",

    "new properties were found out for our gravity - like model together with ap producing explosive percolations .",
    "all simulations are carried out on the triangular lattice of the size @xmath62 with @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "we simulate either of strategy @xmath29 or @xmath31 for either case i or iii .",
    "the total number of links equating to that of time - steps is divided by @xmath19 , which is defined as @xmath65 .",
    "the mass of the largest component divided by @xmath19 makes up the observable @xmath66 , the node fraction of the largest component .",
    "all results presented in this work are obtained from 5000 different realizations of network configurations with @xmath67 if not specially indicated .            inspired by cho and kahng s @xcite work and a referee of ref.@xcite",
    ", we have gone further by calculating fractions of three types of links and arithmetic average lengths of their links .",
    "our attention was pointed at ap first . in fig.1",
    "we illustrated the evolution of fractions of 3 types of links .",
    "just at the threshold the fraction of type - i@xmath68 links has a sharp drop - down , meanwhile that of type - ii @xmath69 shoots up , crossing @xmath70 at @xmath71 . a little after it , @xmath70 crosses with growing fraction of type - iii links ( @xmath72 ) at the level @xmath73 , while @xmath74 gets its summit(@xmath75 ) at the same point , which has not been concerned by previous works . however , it is this property that pervades all cases in the present correlated percolation . in fig.2 , the average lengths of type - ii(@xmath76 )",
    "merges that of type - iii(@xmath77 ) at @xmath15 after an abrupt growth , @xmath76 starts to grow earlier than @xmath77 .",
    "the level of @xmath3 for both of them keep invariant for @xmath78 , while @xmath79 starts to decrease from @xmath15 .",
    "we see from both the figures that in explosive percolation the system undergoes a sharp transition from a type - i link dominant phase into a type - ii and iii dominant phase at @xmath15@xcite .",
    "besides , average lengths undergo a parallel transition at the same point .",

    "fractions for @xmath87 and @xmath88 shift the cross point rightward obviously . on the other hand ,",
    "the curves for @xmath89 cross @xmath72 at @xmath90 for almost all values @xmath0 except @xmath86 . to determine which one would be the candidate of another critical point",
    ", we cast ourselves on the assistance from the observation of average lengths of links . in fig.4 @xmath91 merges @xmath91 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 at @xmath90 , separating themselves from others .",
    "however , almost all other ones collect at @xmath85 , which gives hint to us for @xmath92.(here a better resolution is needed in further calculation ) .",
    "correspondingly , in fig.5 for scaling relation ( 1 ) with exponents @xmath93 , @xmath40 , and @xmath94 , @xmath58 for @xmath95 $ ] collapse into the universal function very well , with that for @xmath86 barely collapsing onto it .",
    "but those @xmath58 for @xmath87 and @xmath88 do not behave well in collapse .",
    "the separation from others at the turning middle part indicates the deviation of their @xmath92 from @xmath96 with which others share . in the description of the average lengths for case i with @xmath36 , simulated results @xmath97 in fig.4 with all values",

    "variation of parameter @xmath0 only shifts starting points of up - growing @xmath74 and @xmath72 as @xmath0 increases .",
    "the saturation effect of large decay exponents @xmath99 appears clearly and is shown by dash lines , which demonstrates the inheritance from traditional correlated percolation@xcite . in this case with @xmath36 , special level of fractions at cross point of @xmath100 and @xmath101 keeps 0.25 just as in ap without any distance - decay included , so does @xmath74 at hiking its summit .     of the system with @xmath36 in case i. @xmath63 and @xmath64.(b)percolation thresholds @xmath15 for @xmath102 and @xmath88 with @xmath36 in case i.,width=336 ]     of type - i , type - ii and type - iii links with strategy @xmath29 in case i. parameters are the same as in fig.6,width=336 ]    as in a usual way , we determine the critical point @xmath15 of percolation by observation of tips of susceptibility @xmath103 ( fig.6 ) . comparing @xmath15 in fig.6 with @xmath97 in fig.4",
    ", we find that these @xmath15 approximately hit the horizontal coordinates of middle point of growing fraction of type - ii links , which means that @xmath15 is the transition point from the inter - cluster - link dominant phase to the intra - cluster - link dominant phase .",
    "besides @xmath15 , we have another ( sub)-critical point @xmath92 which is in certain range independent of decay exponent @xmath0 in gravity model , and @xmath92 indicates the balance between the fractions of type - i and type - ii links , yielding a new scaling behavior of @xmath104 in formula ( 1 ) not revealed by previous works .",
    "moreover , the steady level @xmath105 is always @xmath106independent , type - independent which takes the inherited value of that in ap . actually , 131.5 is the value for l=128 only .",
    "we have size effect since a free boundary condition instead of a periodic one is adopted .",
    "the finite size effect is shown in fig.7 which gives that @xmath107 , i.e. ,    @xmath108    where @xmath19 is the number of nodes on the 2d plane .",
    "hopefully it goes towards infinity in thermodynamic limit .",
    "however , the finite size effect of @xmath109 ( fig.8 for an example ) is not strong enough for us to identify the scaling exponents @xmath110 as usual .",
    "therefore , we can check the validation of scaling laws presented by weinrib @xcite for correlated percolation in the present model only by rescaling susceptibility @xmath111 . fig . 9",
    "illustrates the results of it for examples @xmath112 and @xmath84 , respectively .",

    "the cross points for @xmath89 and @xmath74 shift leftward from @xmath15 of ap as decay exponent @xmath0 increases , which means that @xmath43 as a correlated percolation mechanism weaken the explosive effect caused by ap .",
    "but the starting position of fraction - ii still provides hints of thresholds @xmath15 .",
    "however , it is hard to locate a common cross point for @xmath89 and @xmath72 in a range of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , we have no scaling relation for them .",
    "the steady average lengths of links ( fig.11 ) have the same level of @xmath36 and ap cases , and size - effect ( not shown ) also tells the divergence of @xmath3 , but all of them do not tell any possible hint for critical points",

    "<S> motivated by the importance of geometric information in real systems , a new model for long - range correlated percolation in link - adding networks is proposed with the connecting probability decaying with a power - law of the distance on the two - dimensional(2d ) plane . by overlapping it with achlioptas process </S>",
    "<S> , it serves as a gravity model which can be tuned to facilitate or inhibit the network percolation in a generic view , cover a broad range of thresholds . moreover , it yields a set of new scaling relations . in the present work , </S>",
    "<S> we develop an approach to determine critical points for them by simulating the temporal evolutions of type - i , type - ii and type - iii links(chosen from both inter - cluster links , an intra - cluster link compared with an inter - cluster one , and both intra - cluster ones , respectively ) and corresponding average lengths . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results have revealed objective competition between fractions , average lengths of three types of links , verified the balance happened at critical points . </S>",
    "<S> the variation of decay exponents @xmath0 or transmission radius @xmath1 always shifts the temporal pace of the evolution , while the steady average lengths and the fractions of links always keep unchanged just as the values in achlioptas process . </S>",
    "<S> strategy with maximum gravity can keep steady average length , while that with minimum one can surpass it . without the confinement of transmission range , @xmath2 in thermodynamic limit , while @xmath3 does not when with it . </S>",
    "<S> however , both mechanisms support critical points . in two - dimensional free space , </S>",
    "<S> the relevance of correlated percolation in link - adding process is verified by validation of new scaling relations with various exponent @xmath0 , which violates the scaling law of weinrib s . </S>"
