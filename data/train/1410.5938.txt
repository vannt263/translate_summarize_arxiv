    "the rashba spin - orbit ( so ) coupling@xcite , initially considered in semiconductor devices such as quantum wells@xcite , has been recently reproduced in ultracold atoms @xcite by means of externally applied controlled laser beams .",
    "the relevance of this achievement can be understood in relation to the extremely high degree of control achievable in these systems .",
    "in fact , the absence of interfering phonons present in solid state aggregates and the precise tunability of external laser sources , make ultracold atoms invaluable candidates for the experimental investigation of the most delicate aspects of quantum mechanics , such as so effects .    following this success , a large number of theoretical studies recently focused on the intricate effects of rashba or dresselhaus@xcite so couplings in bose - einstein condensates@xcite , in superfluid fermions at the bcs - bec crossover@xcite , and in the quasi - ideal fermi gas@xcite .",
    "yet , little is known so far concerning the possible effects of so couplings in the repulsive atomic fermi gas , a system which is widely known for its intrinsic and peculiar polarization properties@xcite .    in this manuscript",
    "we will consider a two - component bi - dimensional ( 2d ) atomic fermi assembly in presence of rashba so coupling .",
    "low dimensional atomic fermi systems are of particular relevance in this context , in view of possible spintronics applications , and are currently undergoing experimental investigations@xcite , also in relation to their non - trivial spin transport properties@xcite . in the present system , due to the non - local spin structure induced by the so coupling , a conventional hartree - fock approach based on single - particle states",
    "whose spin is aligned along a fixed axis is not applicable .",
    "we will thus introduce a suitable variational procedure , making use of an appropriate functional form for the single particle orbitals , whose spin structure will depend on a variational parameter .",
    "this approach allows for a seamless connection between spin polarized and unpolarized regimes , through the minimization of a unique energy function .",
    "the hamiltonian of a uniform 2d repulsive fermi gas in presence of rashba spin - orbit coupling can be written as a sum of a one - body ( 1b ) and a two - body ( 2b ) contribution : @xmath0 in second quantization , the single particle contribution is defined as @xmath1 where the two - component quantum field operators @xmath2 are defined in terms of the operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 , which construct and annihilate one particle with spin @xmath5 @xmath6 at the position @xmath7 . the single - particle operator @xmath8 in eq .",
    "accounts for both the kinetic energy and the rashba potential , and is defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 represents the momentum operator , @xmath11 is the 2d identity matrix , and @xmath12 are the @xmath13 pauli matrices .",
    "the quantity @xmath14 represents the particle mass , while @xmath15 is the rashba coupling , accounting for the tunability of the rashba@xcite so coupling ( the second term to the right in eq . ) .",
    "constant @xmath16 was set to 1 to simplify the notation .    as concerns",
    "the two - body contribution , at very low energy only the s - wave scattering will be relevant , and the interaction may be modelled - due to the pauli principle - as a contact potential acting only between particles of opposite spins . in second quantization",
    "the repulsive two - body interaction thus takes the form : @xmath17 the coupling constant @xmath18 is positive , and it may be experimentally tuned by exploiting the feshbach resonance mechanism@xcite . since an effectively 2d atomic gas can be realized by confining a three dimensional ( 3d ) system along the @xmath19 direction within a small thickness @xmath20 , a direct relation exists between the coupling constant @xmath18 , the energetic and geometrical properties of the system , and the 3d scattering length @xmath21 , as discussed in refs .",
    "( ) .    regarding the total density of particles , which will be fixed in our calculations , this is obtained as the expectation value of the operator @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the area of our 2d system .",
    "analogously , the spin polarization is derived from the expectation value of the operator @xmath24",
    "in the absence of so coupling , a straightforward hf ( or mean field ) approach could be applied to our system@xcite .",
    "in fact , in this particular case the hamiltonian commutes with the spin operators , and the single - particle wave functions can be safely chosen as eigenstates of the third pauli matrix @xmath25 .",
    "this choice leads to a clear distinction between spin up ( @xmath26 ) ad spin down ( @xmath27 ) particle densities , and at any given value of @xmath18 the hf energy per volume can thus be expressed as a function of these quantities : @xmath28 .",
    "a minimization of this function at fixed total density @xmath29 , leads to zero polarization ( @xmath30 ) for @xmath18 below the critical value @xmath31 , and full polarization ( either @xmath32 or @xmath33 ) at @xmath34 ( stoner instability@xcite ) .    when including the rashba so coupling , however , the above procedure is not directly applicable .",
    "the main problem with a mean field description based on @xmath25 single - particle eigenstates is that the expectation value of the so coupling on both spin - up and spin - down wave functions is identically zero .",
    "no so energy contribution would thus be present in such a mean field approach .",
    "a possible alternative , explored in recent studies of the 2d electron gas with rashba so coupling@xcite , is to make use of single - particle eigenfunctions of the rashba coupling@xcite .",
    "given the dependence of the so coupling on momentum , these orbitals retain a plane wave structure , accompanied by a @xmath35-dependent spinorial form .",
    "these wave functions provide information about the non - local spin structure induced by the so coupling , leading in general to non - zero so energy contributions . a straightforward use of rashba eigenstates , however , is not possible in our case , since the expectation value of @xmath25 on rashba eigenstates is zero .",
    "a different approach must thus be tailored when aiming to study the polarization properties of our system .    to combine the polarization properties of @xmath25 eigenstates with the non - local structure induced by the rashba coupling",
    ", we introduce a variational many - body state @xmath36 , depending on two variational parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 whose meaning will become clear in the following .    physically , a favorable way of controlling the polarization of a given system is that of applying an external magnetic field , inducing a spin - dependent coupling .",
    "following this idea , we define an auxiliary hamiltonian @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "this hamiltonian only contains single - particle energy terms , and can favor , through the parameter @xmath37 , the alignment or antialignment of the spin along the @xmath19 axis , while still retaining the non - local rashba so coupling .",
    "hence , we explicitly construct our many - body variational wave function as an eigenstate of @xmath42 : @xmath43    the diagonalization of @xmath42 within the single - particle framework leads to the single - particle eigenenergies @xmath44 corresponding to the single - particle eigenstates @xmath45 where the normalization constants @xmath46 are defined to be real and obey the equation : @xmath47 here @xmath48 is a 2d wave vector . as seen , two solutions exist for every fixed value of @xmath49 , corresponding to two distinct energy bands .",
    "these will be hereafter labelled as @xmath50 for simplicity .",
    "we underline that these single particle states depend , through @xmath51 on the external parameter @xmath37 .",
    "this has not been fixed yet , and will be used in the following as a variational parameter .",
    "the variational many - particle wave function @xmath36 is constructed as an antisymmetrized product of the above single particle eigenstates , and is constrained to describe a fixed density of particles @xmath52 through the relation @xmath53 the total density of particles is equal to the sum of the densities relative to the @xmath54 and @xmath55 bands ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the densities of the @xmath50 bands ( @xmath57 ) can in turn be expressed in terms of the relative fermi energies @xmath58 , as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the heaviside step function .",
    "given the constraint of fixed total density @xmath52 , only @xmath38 can be regarded as an independent variable , controlling the relative @xmath61 band occupation in @xmath36 .",
    "depending on the @xmath37 value and the single - particle band occupation , the system will be allowed to develop both a non - local rashba spin texture , or a spin - polarized configuration .",
    "the relevant spin configurations will thus be spanned by our theory , and the present approach will represent an extension of the original variational procedure to a broader space of configurations .    once the variational wave function has been defined , the energy is written as @xmath62 this expression is a function of the parameter @xmath37 and of the single particle band occupation @xmath38 , and its minimization at fixed total density @xmath52 leads to the optimal parameters @xmath63 and @xmath64 , from which the wave function @xmath65 is determined .",
    "we also stress that @xmath66 , differently from @xmath67 , accounts for the presence of the two - body interaction .",
    "finally , after the optimal wave function @xmath65 has been obtained through the variational procedure , the polarization @xmath68 can be straightforwardly computed as @xmath69    as concerns the actual computation of @xmath66 , this can be simplified by making use of the relation .",
    "details and analytical formulas regarding @xmath66 and @xmath68 are reported and discussed in detail in the appendix .",
    "we present in this section the energy and polarization properties of the system at @xmath70 , derived according to the variational procedure introduced in section iii . in the following",
    "we will express lengths in units of @xmath71 , and energies in units of @xmath72 .",
    "as already outlined in section ii ( see appendix for details ) , if @xmath73 no polarization is present in the system , since the single particle states on which @xmath36 relies coincide in this case with the rashba eigenstates . on the other hand ,",
    "if a polarized state is energetically favored with respect to a spin unpolarized configuration , a finite optimal @xmath63 will be found within the variational procedure .     and",
    "@xmath63 , plotted in function of @xmath18 for different values of @xmath15 .",
    "units are specified in the text . ]    clearly , depending on @xmath18 and @xmath15 , different optimal @xmath64 and @xmath63 values will be found , corresponding to different values of the polarization .",
    "interestingly , the introduction of a @xmath37 dependent @xmath36 allows to consistently achieve lower variational energies with respect to using both rashba states and @xmath25 eigenvectors in the polarized regime . according to the variational principle @xmath36",
    "is thus expected to provide a more accurate approximation to the polarized ground states .    to understand the behavior of @xmath36 in relation to the repulsive interaction we analyze @xmath64 and @xmath63 as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath15 ( see fig .",
    "[ figura2 ] ) . clearly , @xmath63 is identically zero below @xmath74 , while increasing values of @xmath63 are found above @xmath74 .",
    "this indicates a modification of the spin configuration of the system upon increasing @xmath18 , related to the development of a polarization .",
    "on the other hand , we stress that an imbalanced occupation of the @xmath54 and @xmath55 bands alone is not sufficient to induce a finite polarization in the system .",
    "in fact , this quantity is closely related to occupation of rashba single - particle bands , and thus to the non - local spin structure of the system .    by analyzing the polarization @xmath68 as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath15 we observe a first - order phase transition , analogous to that found in absence of so , leading to finite polarization at strong repulsion ( see fig .",
    "[ figura3 ] ) . while @xmath68 is identically zero below @xmath74 , a gradual polarization increase with respect to @xmath18 , depending on @xmath15 , is found upon introduction of the so coupling , beyond the critical point .     for different values of @xmath15 .",
    "solid black lines indicate the phase transition ( shifted in the case of @xmath75 ) .",
    "units are specified in the text . ]    a slower convergence to the fully polarized state ( @xmath76 ) is also observed for the larger @xmath15 , while a decrease of @xmath68 with respect to @xmath15 is found at fixed @xmath18 .",
    "this suggests a clear tendency of the so coupling to effectively frustrate the spin alignment .",
    "moreover , large values of @xmath15 can even cause a complete loss of polarization ( @xmath77 ) .",
    "this remarkable effect is visible in fig.[figura3 ] for @xmath78 , and can be understood analytically through an expansion over @xmath37 of the total energy @xmath66 around @xmath79 . under the condition",
    "@xmath80 only the @xmath55 band is occupied ( see for instance fig.[figura2 ] , upper panel ) , and one can prove that , to leading order in @xmath37 @xmath81 where @xmath82 is constant with respect to @xmath37 . clearly , the rashba coupling varies the relative importance of the two - body and one - body terms in the above equation , changing the convexity of @xmath83 with respect to @xmath37 .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath37 that minimizes the energy becomes eventually zero for @xmath84 .",
    "moreover , a numerical study of @xmath85 reveals that @xmath79 is a global minimum in this context , and should represent the best approximation to the ground state , according to the variational principle .",
    "since non - zero @xmath68 is only possible at finite @xmath37 , no spin polarization will be present in the system when @xmath84 .",
    "equivalently , the critical value of @xmath18 , beyond which finite polarization is developed , will depend on the so coupling , and can be expressed as @xmath86 the critical @xmath18 will thus coincide with the value predicted in absence of so coupling if @xmath87 , but it will be shifted to higher values ( stronger repulsion ) , for larger so couplings ( see fig.[figura4 ] ) . as a whole ,",
    "the rashba coupling and the repulsive two - body coupling thus constitute complementary tools for an effective tuning of the system polarization , opening the way to the development of partially polarized states and control of the phase transition .     as a function @xmath15 .",
    "the dashed vertical line separates the regimes of constant and variable @xmath88 .",
    "units are specified in the text . ]    as a final remark , we stress that the present approach reproduces , for @xmath89 , the mean field results presented by conduit @xcite in absence of so . on the other hand ,",
    "the further inclusion of correlation terms was recently shown @xcite to produce a reduction of the critical coupling constant @xmath74 , and a contextual smoothing of the transition .",
    "an analogous behavior is thus expected also in presence of the rashba coupling , while the so effects presented above should be roughly preserved .",
    "in fact so couplings have a one - body structure , and their effects were recently shown to be only marginally influenced by the correlation induced by the two - body repulsion @xcite .",
    "the spin polarization of the two - dimensional fermi gas in presence of contact repulsion and rashba so coupling has been computed from a variational theory , based on the optimization of the wave function spinorial structure . as a result",
    ", we observe no polarization below the critical repulsive coupling @xmath18 predicted in absence of so coupling , and confirm the presence of a phase transition . above criticity the polarization is determined by a competition between the repulsive interaction and the rashba coupling . while the two - body repulsion has a polarizing effect , the so coupling tends to frustrate the spin alignment , and can eventually lead to a complete loss of polarization .",
    "this mechanism determines a variability of the critical @xmath18 as a function of @xmath15 , with a consequent shift of the phase transition .",
    "contextually , partially polarized states can be obtained by tuning @xmath15 .",
    "we acknowledge francesco pederiva and enrico lipparini for useful discussions .",
    "we provide here an analytic computation of @xmath66 defined in eq . .",
    "to make use of the convenient single - particle energy expressions given in eq . , we first observe that @xmath90 .",
    "the variational energy can thus be recast into @xmath91 the eigenvalue @xmath67 defined in eq . can be computed as @xmath92 , where @xmath93 are defined as the sum of the single particle energies ( see eq . ) .",
    "regarding the @xmath55 band , instead , one has to distinguish between the cases @xmath95 ( single intersection with the @xmath55 band ) , and @xmath96 ( double intersection with the @xmath55 band ) : @xmath97 \\nonumber \\\\     & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\text{if } \\epsilon_-^f>-\\zeta   \\ , , \\hspace{3 mm }   \\nonumber   \\\\ = & \\frac{n_-}{2\\lambda_r^2}(\\pi^2 n_-^2-\\zeta^2+\\lambda_r^2)-     \\nonumber \\\\ & -\\frac{1}{2\\pi}\\frac{1}{3\\lambda_r^3 } \\big[\\left(\\lambda_r^2 + \\pi n_- \\right)^3-\\left(\\lambda_r^2 - \\pi n_- \\right)^3 \\big ] \\nonumber \\\\    & \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad \\text{if } \\epsilon_-^f<-\\zeta \\ ,",
    ". \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dependence on @xmath98 can be easily removed from the above equations through the relation @xmath99 .",
    "analogously to @xmath93 , the expectation value of the two - body interaction @xmath100 ( indicated as @xmath101 ) and of the operator @xmath102 ( indicated with @xmath103 ) are also defined as functions of @xmath104 and @xmath37 .",
    "since in both cases @xmath103 contains @xmath37 as an overall multiplicative factor , no polarization is possible for @xmath79 , in line with the observations of sec .",
    "we remind , in this regard , that the polarization @xmath68 ( see eq . ) is related to @xmath103 by @xmath109 .",

    "<S> motivated by the remarkable experimental control of synthetic gauge fields in ultracold atomic systems , we investigate the effect of an artificial rashba spin - orbit coupling on the spin polarization of a two - dimensional repulsive fermi gas . by using a variational many - body wavefunction , based on a suitable spinorial structure </S>",
    "<S> , we find that the polarization properties of the system are indeed controlled by the interplay between spin - orbit coupling and repulsive interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , two main effects are found : 1 ) the rashba coupling determines a gradual increase of the degree of polarization beyond the critical repulsive interaction strength , at variance with conventional 2d stoner instability . </S>",
    "<S> 2 ) the critical interaction strength , above which finite polarization is developed , shows a dependence on the rashba coupling , _ </S>",
    "<S> i.e. _ it is enhanced in case the rashba coupling exceeds a critical value . a simple analytic expression for the critical interaction strength is further derived in the context of our variational formulation , which allows for a straightforward and insightful analysis of the present problem . </S>"
