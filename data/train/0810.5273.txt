    "in the case of hd  209458b , absorptions of several percents for hi lyman-@xmath1 , oi and cii have been measured in the hydrodynamically escaping upper atmosphere ( vidal - madjar 2003 , 2004 , 2008 , dsert et al .",
    "2004 , lecavelier des etangs 2007 , ehrenreich et al . 2008 ) and a hot layer of hydrogen have been detected ( ballester et al . 2007 ) .",
    "more recently , rayleigh scattering by h@xmath2 molecules has been identified ( lecavelier et  al .",
    "2008b ) from sets of hst / stis observations",
    "( charbonneau et al .",
    "2002 , knutson et al .",
    "2007 , sing et  al .",
    "2008a , b ) . from the same datasets , the possible presence of tio / vo as been studied ( dsert et al . 2008 ) .",
    "the observing program was originally designed to observe hd  209458b with hst / stis .",
    "after stis failure , it has been possible to execute the program with hst / acs during cycle 13 . the program ( go10145 )",
    "consists in @xmath3 visits , performed with the acs / hrc and the acs / sbc .",
    "the results obtained using acs / sbs with pr110l prism spectroscopy around the lyman-@xmath1 line are presented in a separated paper ( ehrenreich et la .",
    "the two other visits are composed of @xmath4 orbits ( @xmath5 ) . each orbit was plan to be a sequence of direct image filters and prism pr200l spectra at various exposure times .",
    "the normal observing technique for all acs - hrc pr200l spectroscopy is to obtain a direct image of the field followed by the dispersed prism image .",
    "this combination allows the wavelength calibration of individual target spectra by reference to the corresponding direct images .",
    "we obtain few exposures of 0.1s , 3.6 s , 40 s , and 540 s during the two transit observed .",
    "all the images were saturated .",
    "hrc pr200l slitless spectroscopy yields spectral 2d calibrated images . the spectral image is composed of the stellar halo surrounding the stellar center position , the red pile - up resulting from the built up of photons on a few detector pixels which appear when using a prism the saturation zone and the stellar continuum between 150 and 400 nm .",
    "the spectral resolution significantly diminishes toward the red . for bright objects , such as hd  209458",
    ", this effect can lead to blooming of the hrc ccd from filled wells ; the overfilled pixels bleed in the detector y direction .",
    "the tilt of the prism causes a deviation of about 300 pixels between the position of the direct object and the region of the dispersed spectrum on the ccd .",
    "all the effect described previously make this extraction very difficult .",
    "we used the flat - fielded spectral images to extract the spectra .",
    "since there is no slit in the acs , the point spread function of the target modulates the spectral resolution .",
    "the so called background is the sum of the effects of the real background , the halo , and the diffraction spikes . due to the quasi central symmetry of the image",
    ", we considered that a good evaluation of the background was to consider the opposite pixels from the star .",
    "the current calibration of the wavelength solution used in the axe data reduction software assumes the use of these apertures . at 3500  ,",
    "the dispersion drops to 105   per pixel lyman-@xmath1and is 563   per pixel at 5000  .",
    "we parameterized the transit light curve with 4 variables : the planet - star radius ratio @xmath6 , the stellar radius to orbital radius ratio @xmath7 , the impact parameter @xmath8 , and the time of mid - transit @xmath9 .",
    "we used the transit routine ` occultnl ` developed by mandel & agol ( 2002 ) where limb - darkening corrections are taken into account .",
    "we then performed a least - squares fit to our data over the whole parameter space .",
    "we extracted the nuv radius of hd  209458b at 2 bandpasses .",
    "we are able to detect the stellar mgii doublet at   2800  . we found a radius of @xmath0 in agreement with the radius of @xmath10 found in the visible ( knutson et al .",
    "2007 ) obtain from stis / hst observations .",
    "although acs is very sensitive , the error bars derived here are large since they include various systematics that affect the determination of the radius of the planet .",
    "the telescope jitter , dithering and intra - pixel sensitivity variations are responsible for severe fluctuations observed in individual spectra .",
    "we conclude that dithering should not be used for precision photometry when levels of 0.01% are needed . finally , the exposures were all saturated which introduce not linearity effects and thus make the comparison between consecutive wavelength difficult .",
    "the error bars we derived are to large to draw any firm conclusion on the detection of absorbers potentially present in the atmosphere and which could be observed in this wavelength domain .",
