    "ultracompact ( uc ) hii  regions are very small ( @xmath50.1  pc ) and dense ( @xmath1@xmath11  @xmath12 ) ionized regions ( wood @xmath13 churchwell 1989a , hereafter wc89 ; kurtz , churchwell , @xmath13 wood 1994 , hereafter kcw ) .",
    "they are bright radio and infrared sources and seem to be still embedded in the parental molecular clouds . thus these objects have been thought to represent an early evolutionary stage of massive stars .",
    "one of the most interesting problems related to them is that too many uc  hii  regions are observed in the galaxy , i.e. , the `` age problem '' : the number of uc  hii  regions is greater by about an order of magnitude than expected from other indicators of massive star formation rate based on their dynamical age ( wc89 ; wood @xmath13 churchwell 1989b ) .",
    "hence , it has been considered that hii  regions should remain in the ultracompact phase for a much longer ( @xmath110@xmath8  yr ) period than their sound crossing time ( @xmath510@xmath6  yr ) in a uniform medium .",
    "several different models were proposed to resolve this problem : the infall model , photo - evaporating disk model , pressure - confined model , and stellar - wind supporting bow shock model ( see churchwell 2000 and references therein ) .",
    "these models present various mechanisms which constrain hii  regions to remain longer in the ultracompact phase .",
    "on the other hand , there is some observational evidence to suggest that uc  hii  regions are _ not _ as young as they appear .",
    "the ultracompactness of uc  hiiregions might arise because interferometric observations are insensitive to structures larger than a certain extent depending on the baseline range . using the very large array ( vla ) d - array , which is sensitive to large ( @xmath215@xmath3 ) structures , koo et al .",
    "( 1996 ) found that g5.48@xmath40.24 , known as an uc  hii  region , is actually a large hii  region complex that contains structures of diverse length scales ranging from 0.04 to 40  pc : it has an ultracompact core , a compact core , an extended halo , and a diffuse large plateau .",
    "the presence of the extended envelope could be direct evidence supporting that the uc  hii  region is much older than 10@xmath6  yr ( see   5 for more details ) .",
    "it also implies that there are much more ionizing photons than what would have been estimated from the ultracompact core alone .",
    "a few other groups have also noted the importance of extended emission around uc  hii  regions in understanding the nature of hii  regions ( garay et al .",
    "1993 ; kurtz et al .",
    "for example , kurtz et al . ( 1999 ) detected extended emission towards 12 out of 15 randomly selected sources from the kcw survey , and suggested on the basis of its morphology that the extended emission may be directly connected with uc  hii  regions in about half ( 8/15 ) of the sources .",
    "however , the physical relationship between uc  hii  regions and their extended envelopes is still poorly understood .    in this study",
    ", we undertook vla radio continuum observations of 16 uc  hii  regions in search of associated extended emission and detected diffuse extended emission in all the sources .",
    "a preliminary version of these results was presented by kim @xmath13 koo ( 1996 ) .",
    "we also made h76@xmath0  and he76@xmath0  radio recombination line ( rrl ) observations in order to study the physical association between the uc  hii  regions and their extended envelopes .",
    "the observations are described in   2 and the results are presented in   3 .",
    "we investigate the relationship between the parameters of the uc  hii  regions and their envelopes in   4 and discuss the physical association between the two , the origin of extended envelopes , and their implication in resolving the age problem in   5 .",
    "some individual sources are discussed in   6 and our main conclusions are summarized in   7 .",
    "we have carried out radio continuum observations of 16 uc  hii  regions with @xmath240@xmath1420@xmath15 resolution at 21  cm ( table 1 ) .",
    "the observations were made during 1995 february using the vla of the national radio astronomy observatory ( nrao ) in the dnc hybrid configuration .",
    "so our observations are sensitive to structures smaller than 15@xmath3 .",
    "we have selected 16 uc  hii  regions from the wc89 catalog ( table 2 ) .",
    "these uc  hii  regions are ones with simple morphology and large ( @xmath110 ) ratios of single - dish to vla fluxes . here simple morphology means that they each are not resolved into two or more clearly distinct components .",
    "this requirement is to avoid possible confusion by nearby uc  hiiregions in exploring the association between an uc  hii  region and extended emission .",
    "they consist of one shell - type , two spherical , three core - halo type , four cometary , and six irregular ( or multiply peaked ) uc  hii  regions . in order to improve the _ u - v _ coverage ,",
    "each source was observed at several hour angles .",
    "the flux density was referred to 3c  286 , which was assumed to have flux densities of 15.03 jy ( at 1.385 ghz ) and 14.64 jy ( at 1.465 ghz ) .",
    "the data were edited , calibrated , imaged , and cleaned following the standard vla procedures in the astronomical image processing system ( aips ) .",
    "self - calibration was accomplished for several appropriate sources to reduce the rms noise level of their final images .",
    "we observed h76@xmath0  rrls , which have a rest frequency of 14,689.99 mhz , toward all of the objects in our sample .",
    "the observations were undertaken with the 140 foot ( 43 m ) telescope of the nrao in 1997 february and june .",
    "the telescope has an angular resolution ( fwhm ) of about 2@xmath3 and a main beam efficiency of 0.58 at the observing frequency . in order to diminish the effects of standing waves between the telescope and receiver , we observed with focus",
    "alternately displaced @xmath16@xmath17/8 from its peak value .",
    "both circular polarizations were observed simultaneously using two 1024 channel autocorrelators with 40  mhz bandwidth each , and thus the velocity resolution was 1.59  km  s@xmath10  after hanning smoothing .",
    "each spectrum was obtained by integrating typically for 20 minutes using frequency switching . the system temperature varied in the range 40@xmath460  k during the observing sessions depending on weather conditions and elevation of the source .",
    "we mapped g5.89@xmath40.39 ( 16@xmath3@xmath1810@xmath3 ) and g5.97@xmath41.17 ( 18@xmath3@xmath1814@xmath3 ) in full - beam spacing .",
    "for the other sources , we made observations at 1@xmath413 positions including the peak positions in each envelope ( see figs .",
    "1@xmath191@xmath20 ) .",
    "he76@xmath0  ( 14,695.97  mhz )",
    "rrls were also observed at a total of 18 positions in 6 sources ( see table 5 ) .",
    "these positions are ones where strong h76@xmath0  line emission was detected .",
    "we detected extended emission in all our sources .",
    "figures 1@xmath191@xmath20 show their images .",
    "the extended envelopes are from @xmath21 to @xmath22 in angular extent , and their morphologies range from a relatively simple structure with a single peak ( e.g. , g8.14 + 0.23 , g23.71 + 0.17 , and g23.96 + 0.15 ) to a fairly complicated structure with several compact components ( e.g. , g10.15@xmath40.34 , g10.30@xmath40.15 , and g29.96@xmath40.02 ) .",
    "all the uc  hii  regions except for g23.46@xmath40.20 and g25.72 + 0.05 are located at the peak positions .",
    "both of the latter are spherical uc  hii  regions lying near the edge of extended hii  regions .",
    "if we adopt the distances given by wc89 ( table 2 ) , the geometric mean diameters range from 0.56  pc to 5.68  pc for the compact components and from 3.8  pc to 18.7  pc for the extended envelopes .",
    "based on their linear sizes ( and physical parameters ) , the compact components would have been classified as compact or dense hii  regions while the extended components would have been categorized as classical hii  regions ( habing &  israel 1979 ) .",
    "table 3 presents the basic observed parameters of our sources . in the first column of this table ,",
    "a@xmath4c represent the brightest three compact components in order of decreasing peak brightness .",
    "the first entry for each source refers to the extended component including uc  hii  region and compact component(s ) .    in the sources with two or more compact components ,",
    "the uc  hii  regions tend to lie in the smallest and densest ones .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 , where we plot angular and linear sizes versus distance for the compact components .",
    "most ( 11/14 ) of the compact components with uc  hii  regions are smaller than 2  pc , whereas all but two without uc  hii  regions are larger .",
    "the average diameter ( 1.6  pc ) of the compact components with uc  hii  regions is about half of that of those without uc  hii  regions ( 3.5  pc ) . on the other hand",
    ", there seems to be no relationship between the morphologies of uc  hii  region and its extended envelope .",
    "assuming that the hii  region is spherically symmetric , optically thin , homogeneous , dust - free , and ionization - bounded , we derived the electron number density @xmath23 , emission measure @xmath24 , excitation parameter @xmath25 , and mass @xmath26  of the ionized gas from the observed integrated flux densities ( schraml @xmath13 mezger 1969 ; panagia @xmath13 walmsley 1978 ) .",
    "we also estimated the lyman continuum photon flux @xmath27  required to ionize each source using the formulae of rubin ( 1968 ) .",
    "here we used the electron temperatures given by downes et al .",
    "( 1980 ) and wink et al .",
    "table 4 summarizes the results .",
    "the table also lists the spectral type of the ionizing star of each source ( panagia 1973 ) .",
    "this assumes that a single zero - age main sequence ( zams ) star is responsible for the ionization .",
    "the spectral types of the compact components with uc  hii  regions are approximately three subclasses earlier than those measured from uc  hii  regions alone in wc89 , which are given in parentheses .",
    "if a source is produced by a stellar cluster , rather than by a single star , then the most luminous star in the cluster would be about two subclasses later than the equivalent single - star spectral type ( see , e.g. , kcw ) .",
    "we determined the fraction of ultraviolet ( uv ) photons absorbed by dust within the ionized gas , @xmath28=1@xmath4@xmath27/@xmath29 , where @xmath29 is the total rate of lyman continuum photons of the ionizing star ( table 4 ) . in this calculation , we adopted the value of @xmath29 from wc89 , which was derived primarily from the @xmath30 data under the assumption that a single star provides the entire infrared luminosity .",
    "we used the value of the associated ( or the nearest ) compact component for @xmath27 , considering the low ( @xmath24@xmath3 ) resolution of @xmath30 observations .",
    "our values of @xmath28 might be overestimates because the sizes of the compact components are frequently smaller than the @xmath30 beamsize . in the majority ( 11/16 ) of our sources , nevertheless , the estimated fractions ( @xmath3160% ) are significantly less than those ( @xmath180% ) determined by wc89 and kcw for most uc  hii  regions in their catalogs .",
    "this discrepancy may be mainly due to the contribution from extended emission around uc  hii  regions .",
    "accordingly , the dust absorption of stellar uv radiation within the hii  regions seems to be less important than suggested by previous studies .",
    "we detected h76@xmath0  line emission in all the sources except g12.43@xmath40.05 , which was the weakest radio continuum source in our sample .",
    "figure 3 shows a sample from our rrl spectra at g10.15@xmath40.34 ( + 05.@xmath322 , + 00@xmath3 10@xmath15 ) , where the strongest h76@xmath0  line emission was detected .",
    "we performed a least - squares fit of each spectrum to a single gaussian profile .",
    "table 5 gives the gaussian parameters of the h76@xmath0  lines .",
    "in this table , columns ( 2)@xmath4(5 ) are the equatorial coordinates , the central velocity , the line intensity , and the line width ( fwhm ) , respectively .",
    "the equatorial coordinates are given as offsets with respect to the position of uc  hii  region .",
    "errors quoted are statistical @xmath161  @xmath33 errors in the fit only .",
    "the central velocities of our rrls detected toward uc  hii  regions are in good agreement with those of previous single - dish observations ( downes et al .",
    "1980 ; wink et al . 1982 ; lockman 1989 )",
    ". we can find no significant velocity difference between the spectrum observed toward each uc  hii  region and the average spectrum of its extended envelope with one exception ( g25.72 + 0.05 ) .",
    "this indicates that the two components are physically associated . in the case of g25.72 + 0.05 , h76@xmath0  line emission",
    "was observed at 98  km  s@xmath10toward the uc  hii  region while it was detected at 54  km  s@xmath10   in the nearby compact component , suggesting that they constitute a chance coincidence in the line of sight . in seven sources ( g5.89@xmath40.39 , g5.97@xmath41.17 , g10.15@xmath40.34 , g10.30@xmath40.15 , g12.21@xmath40.10 , g23.46@xmath40.20 , and g29.96@xmath40.02 ) , on the other hand , the ionized gas in some part of the envelope is blue- or redshifted by 3@xmath410  km  s@xmath10  with respect to the compact component associated with an uc  hii  region .",
    "for instance , the eastern part of g10.15@xmath40.34 is blueshifted from its central region by @xmath210  km  s@xmath10  ( fig .",
    "4 ) . we will discuss in detail the velocity structure of individual sources in   6 .",
    "the h76@xmath0  line width is usually larger in the compact components , especially in the ones with uc  hii  regions , than in the extended envelopes for the resolved sources ( see   6.1 and   6.2 ) .",
    "this trend probably occurs because turbulent motions , including large - scale expansion or contraction motions , are larger in the compact components than in the extended envelopes , as proposed by garay &  rodrguez ( 1983 ) .",
    "he76@xmath0  line emission was detected at 10 out of the 18 observed positions ( table 6 ) .",
    "the singly ionized helium abundance ( by number ) y@xmath34 was estimated at these positions from the ratio of the he76@xmath0  to h76@xmath0  line integrals .",
    "the derived values ( 0.063@xmath40.080 ) for g10.30@xmath40.15 , g23.46@xmath40.20 , and g29.96@xmath40.02 are comparable to the average value ( 0.074@xmath160.003 ) in our galaxy ( shaver et al .",
    "1983 ) , while the values ( 0.016@xmath40.049 ) for g5.89@xmath40.39 , g5.97@xmath41.17 , and g10.15@xmath40.34 are significantly lower .",
    "the low value of y@xmath34 implies that either the sizes of heii  regions are significantly smaller than those of hii  regions or the he abundance y is low at the observed positions . for g5.89@xmath40.39 and g5.97@xmath41.17 ,",
    "the observed low value is likely to be due to the low effective temperature of the ionizing stars ( o7 ) ( mezger 1980 ) .",
    "additionally these two objects are at galactocentric distances of 6@xmath47  kpc where the metal abundance is known to be significantly higher than in the solar neighborhood ( shaver et al .",
    "the high metallicity could make the sizes of heii  regions smaller .",
    "this is not true for g10.15@xmath40.34 , which has ionizing stars of spectral type o5 or earlier .",
    "such stars emit hard enough photons to singly ionize helium in the entire hii region .",
    "this view is supported by the fact that normal values were observed for y@xmath34 in g10.30@xmath40.15 , g23.46@xmath40.20 , and g29.96@xmath40.02 , which have ionizing stars of o5 or o5.5 .",
    "we can also exclude the possibility that y is low in the region because the value ( @xmath350.063 ) is approximately normal in g10.30@xmath40.15 , which is located in the same molecular cloud ( see   6.3 ) .",
    "a possible explanation for the low y@xmath34 observed in g10.15@xmath40.34 is that helium ionizing photons are preferentially absorbed by dust in the nebula as in sgr  b2 ( e.g. , chaisson , lichten , &  rodrguez 1978 ) .",
    "what is the physical relationship between the ultracompact , compact , and extended components in each source ? according to our rrl observations , the compact component(s ) and extended envelope appear to be physically associated in the individual sources . on the other hand ,",
    "our measurements of the h76@xmath0  line emission toward uc  hii  regions were likely to be dominated by their associated compact components , rather than that due to the uc  hii  regions themselves , since our beam size ( @xmath22@xmath3 ) is much larger than the typical size ( @xmath510@xmath15 ) of the uc  hii  regions . in order to investigate the physical relationship between uc  hii  regions and their associated compact components",
    ", therefore , we compare our h76@xmath0  line data with the rrl and molecular line data of uc  hii  regions taken from the literature ( table 7 ) . in this comparison",
    ", we do not include g12.43@xmath40.05 , in which the h76@xmath0  line was not detected .",
    "g23.46@xmath40.20 and g25.72 + 0.05 are also excluded because they have no associated compact components .",
    "figure 5 exhibits the results . on the whole ,",
    "the central velocities of the two components are in rough agreement and there is no systematic trend between the two parameters . for 5 uc  hii  regions ,",
    "our results are compared with those of high - resolution rrl observations ( andrews et al .",
    "1985 ; churchwell et al .",
    "1990b ; afflerbach et al .",
    ". the central velocity of the uc  hii  region is equal to that of its associated compact component within 2  km  s@xmath10  for g6.55@xmath40.10 , g12.21@xmath40.10 , and g29.96@xmath40.02 , and within 6  km  s@xmath10  for g5.89@xmath40.39 and g23.96 + 0.15 . for the other uc  hii  regions ,",
    "our h76@xmath0  lines are compared with their associated nh@xmath36 or cs ( 7@xmath46 ) lines ( churchwell et al .",
    "1990a ; cesaroni et al .",
    "1992 ; plume et al .",
    "these molecular lines trace the densest part of a cloud , and their velocities should be close to those of uc  hii  regions ( e.g. , forster et al .",
    "we could not find any significant ( @xmath16  km  s@xmath10 ) difference between the two velocities except for g23.71 + 0.17 , for which the difference is @xmath210  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "this large velocity difference is probably due to a relative motion between the ionized and molecular gas .",
    "table 7 also presents the average difference between the velocities of the ultracompact and compact components , @xmath37 , for each line emission .",
    "figure 6 displays @xmath38/@xmath39  versus @xmath39/@xmath40  for 14 sources in which the uc  hii  region has an associated compact component . here",
    "@xmath38 , @xmath39 , and @xmath40  are the lyman continuum photon fluxes of the ultracompact , compact , and extended components , respectively .",
    "for @xmath38 , we used the values estimated by wc89 from flux densities at 2  cm or 6  cm .",
    "the ratios of @xmath39/@xmath40  are greater than 65% for all the sources with a single peak except for g5.97@xmath41.17 , which has a ratio of about 30% . on the other hand ,",
    "@xmath38/@xmath39  is less than 35% for 12 of the 14 sources .",
    "our values of @xmath38/@xmath39  and @xmath39/@xmath40  may be , respectively , overestimated and underestimated and so should be taken as upper limits and lower limits , since uc  hii  regions are optically thin at 2  cm or 6  cm but optically thick at 21  cm .",
    "the extreme cases are g5.89@xmath40.39 and g29.96@xmath40.02 , for which @xmath39  is equal to or less than @xmath38 .",
    "the uc  hii  region , compact component(s ) , and extended envelope in each source have approximately the same radial velocity and thus the three components are likely to be physically associated in almost all of our sources .",
    "are they ionized by the same source or by separate sources ?",
    "although they are physically associated , they can still be ionized by separate sources , e.g. , by stars of different ages in associations .",
    "this is closely related to how massive stars form from molecular clouds and how they destroy the natal clouds .",
    "first , in order to examine whether the compact components in each source are excited by the same ionizing source or not , we estimated how much lyman continuum photon flux the ionizing star in the strongest compact component can provide for nearby components in sources with two or more compact components .",
    "here it was assumed that the strongest component is density - bounded and the star maintains the ionization of the entire hii  region ( including all compact components and extended envelope ) .",
    "the flux supplied depends on the solid angle subtended by the compact component from the ionizing star .",
    "the derived fluxes are much less ( 0.3%@xmath430% ) than the required values in all the sources . in the case of g10.15@xmath40.34 , for example",
    ", the ionizing source in the eastern compact component can supply the western one with at most 15% of the required flux .",
    "_ hence , the compact components in each source appear to be ionized by separate sources .",
    "_    what about the compact components and their envelopes ? as stated in",
    "  4.2 , the ratios of @xmath39/@xmath40  are greater than 65% for all the sources with a single peak except for g5.97@xmath41.17 .",
    "the surface brightness decreases monotonically from the compact component peak to the envelope edge in these sources .",
    "_ therefore , it seems probable that the extended envelope is entirely or at least significantly ionized by the exciting star of the compact component .",
    "_ in the case of sources with two or more compact components , the envelope of each compact component could have been produced by uv photons escaping from the compact component in a similar manner to the sources with a single peak . the individual envelopes might have merged to form a larger envelope at later times .",
    "however , we can not exclude absolutely the possibility that the large envelope may have been created by separate ionizing sources , such as massive stars in an earlier generation as in the sequential star formation model ( elmegreen & lada 1977 ) .",
    "we can also ask whether the uc  hii  region and its associated compact component are excited by the same source or by separate sources . as noted in   3.1 , the uc  hii  regions correspond to the peaks of their associated compact components in all the sources and the compact components with uc  hii  regions are usually smaller and denser than those without uc  hii  regions . for three sources ,",
    "i.e. , g5.89@xmath40.39 , g6.55@xmath40.10 , and g29.96@xmath40.02 , we were able to confirm that the uc  hii  region is still located at the peak of radio continuum emission in available data obtained at higher resolution ( zijlstra et al .",
    "1990 ; andrews , basart , & lamb 1985 ; fey et al .",
    "if they are ionized by independent sources , one would not expect these correlations .",
    "_ hence the uc  h@xmath41 region and its associated compact component are likely to be excited by the same ionizing source in our samples . _",
    "if this is true , the fractions of uv photons that escape from the uc  hiiregions , @xmath42=1@xmath4@xmath38/@xmath39 , are estimated to be 65%@xmath497% for our sources .",
    "these are probably underestimates ( see   4.2 )      the age problem of uc  hii  regions originates from the results of wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) , who found that uc  hii  regions have peculiar @xmath30 60 - 12  @xmath43 m  and 25 - 12  @xmath43 m  colors , log@xmath44 and log@xmath45 , and evaluated the total number of uc  hii  regions in the galaxy to be 1650@xmath43300 based on these color criteria .",
    "since the @xmath30 sample is sensitivity - limited , most of them are likely to be embedded o stars .",
    "this estimate is about 10 times greater than the number derived from the known formation rate of o stars , e.g. , 4@xmath1810@xmath46 o stars  yr@xmath10 ( see garay & lizano 1999 ) , and the dynamical age ( @xmath510@xmath6 yr ) of uc  hii  regions .",
    "however , almost all of the uc  hii  regions in our sample have extended ( @xmath1 a few 1 pc ) envelopes ionized by the same sources , which implies that their actual ages are @xmath110@xmath8  yr ( see next section ) . if most uc  hii  regions are associated with extended emission as in our sources , therefore , the age problem is expected to be resolved although we need to explain how structures with very different length scales can coexist in an hii  region for a long time .    in order to address this issue , we calculated the ratios of single - dish ( @xmath47 ) to vla fluxes ( @xmath48 ) for 30 uc  hii  regions with simple morphology in the wc89 catalog .",
    "here we used the 11  cm flux densities observed with the effelsberg 100  m telescope ( fwhm@xmath494.@xmath503 ) ( f@xmath51rst et al .",
    "most of the uc  hii  regions have large ratios ( fig . 7 ) .",
    "for instance , about 70% have ratios @xmath75 or @xmath48/@xmath47@xmath310.2 .",
    "the derived ratios are likely to be underestimated , since the uc  hii  regions are quite optically thick at 11  cm . however , this may have little effect on our result .",
    "one may suspect that the result is attributed to selection effects of the wc89 survey , because their original target list was created by selecting strong compact sources from previous single - dish surveys .",
    "thus we also determined the flux ratios for 22 simple uc  hii  regions in the survey of kcw , which were chosen by the @xmath30 color criteria of wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) , and obtained a very similar result ( fig .",
    "7 ) . for comparison , we computed the ratios for the 15 sources of kurtz et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which consist of 8 simple and 7 complex uc  hii  regions .",
    "about 80% of the 12 sources with extended emission have ratios @xmath110 , while two of the 3 sources without extended emission have ratios @xmath315 .",
    "_ consequently , most sources known as uc  h@xmath41 regions are likely to be associated with extended emission , analogous to our sources . _    the @xmath30 color criteria of wood & churchwell ( 1989b ) were established using the uc  hii  regions in the wc89 catalog .",
    "so the color criteria may select compact or extended hii  regions as well as uc  hii  regions .",
    "this idea is consistent with the results of codella , felli , & natale ( 1994 ) who found that more than half of 445 diffuse hii  regions are related to @xmath30 point sources that satisfy the color criteria .",

    "however , we could not find any apparent variation in the @xmath30 colors with @xmath47/@xmath48 , which implies that the @xmath30 colors are not very sensitive to the presence of extended emission .",
    "our observations show that an uc  hii  region is usually surrounded by more extended emission , which appears to be excited by the same ionizing source .",
    "various models were suggested to explain the longevity of uc  hii  regions , as mentioned in   1 , but none of them predicted the presence of extended emission around them .",
    "we consider the origin of the extended envelopes of uc  hii  regions in this section .",

    "the signposts of massive star formation , such as uc  hii  regions and maser sources , are commonly observed in the molecular clumps .",
    "the hot cores are closely associated with uc  hii  regions .",
    "they are believed to be the sites of massive star formation where uc  hii  regions have not yet developed ( e.g. , cesaroni et al .",
    "1994 ) or remnants of the gas from which the massive stars formed ( e.g. , garay & rodrguez 1990 ) .",
    "the sizes of the hot cores and molecular clumps agree roughly with those of uc  hii  regions and their associated compact components in our sample , respectively .",
    "we can first think of the possibility that the extended envelope could be formed very soon after the central star turns on , e.g. , before the hii  region starts to expand dynamically .",
    "it may depend on the density of interclump medium and volume filling factor of dense clumps . according to earlier studies on the internal structures of the molecular clumps in massive star - forming regions ( snell et al .",
    "1984 ; stutzki et al .",
    "1988 ; stutzki & gesten 1990 ; plume et al . 1997 ) , the interclump medium density is generally @xmath110@xmath6  @xmath12  and the volume filling factor varies between @xmath310.1 and 0.5 and tends to increase with approaching the peak . assuming that the spectral type of ionizing star is o6 , the initial strgren radii of hii  regions would be @xmath310.15  pc , which are much less than the typical size of molecular clumps . to our knowledge , there is no previous detailed study on the substructures of the hot cores .",

    "we propose a simple model in which _ the existence of the extended emission around uc  h@xmath41 regions can be explained by combining the champagne flow model with the hierarchical structure of massive star - forming regions _",
    "( tenorio - tagle 1982 and references therein ) .",
    "figure 8 is a schematic representation of our model .",

    "a champagne flow would develop when an ionization front ( of d - type ) breaks out of the core .",
    "the timescale that the ionization front needs to reach the core s edge depends on the depth of the exciting star inside the core .",
    "assuming that the depth is 0.03  pc , the timescale will be @xmath210@xmath6  yr from the expansion law for hii  regions in a uniform medium ( spitzer 1968 ) .",
    "if @xmath27  is significantly less than 10@xmath60  s@xmath10 and/or @xmath57 is greater than 10@xmath58  @xmath12 , the hii  region can reach pressure equilibrium without breaking through the core s boundary as in the pressure - confined model of uc  hii  regions ( de pree , rodrguez , @xmath13 goss 1995 ; garca - segura @xmath13 franco 1996 ) .",
    "the supersonic gas flow drives a strong isothermal shock moving away from the core and a rarefaction wave traveling toward the exciting star .",
    "the velocity of the champagne flow , which is determined by the pressure contrast at the edge , could increase up to 30  km  s@xmath10 . according to whitworth ( 1979 ) who estimated the efficiency with which o stars disperse their parental molecular clouds ,",
    "the erosion timescale can be calculated from the following formula    @xmath61    if this result is adopted , the lifetime of the hot core would be about 3@xmath1810@xmath8  yr",
    ". meanwhile , the hii  region continues to be ultracompact within the hot core while it could grow up to a few 1  pc outside the core .",
    "another champagne flow would develop when the ionization front crosses the edge of the molecular clump .",

    "we could find the champagne flows in several sources ",
    "3.2 based on the velocity gradient of h76@xmath0  line emission and/or the morphology of radio continuum image ( see also   6 ) .",
    "this is compatible with expectation of our model .",
    "it is difficult to detect the champagne flows in all the sources because of the large line width and non - gaussian profile of h76@xmath0  lines as well as various viewing angles .",
    "we may not expect to obtain direct evidence for the large velocity gradients on length scales of molecular clumps or smaller owing to the low resolution and coarse sampling of our rrl observations .",
    "however , the larger line width of rrls in the compact components noted earlier is consistent with our model . in the light of the model presented here , among our sources g5.97@xmath41.17 and g8.14 + 0.23 are good examples of hii  regions observed at viewing angles of about 0@xmath62  and 90@xmath62 , respectively ( see   6.2 and   6.6.2 ) .      for uc and compact hii  regions , @xmath23  was found to be on the average proportional to d@xmath10 ( garay et al .",

    "<S> we have carried out 21 cm radio continuum observations of 16 uc  hii  regions using the vla ( d - array ) in a search for associated extended emission . </S>",

    "<S> the uc  hii  regions have simple morphologies and large ( @xmath110 ) ratios of single - dish to vla fluxes . </S>",
    "<S> we detected extended emission towards all the sources . </S>",
    "<S> the extended emission consists of one to several compact ( @xmath21@xmath3 or 0.5@xmath45  pc ) components and a diffuse extended ( 2@xmath3@xmath412@xmath3 or 4@xmath419  pc ) envelope . </S>",
    "<S> all the uc  hii  regions but two are located in the compact components , where the uc  hii  regions always correspond to their peaks . </S>",
    "<S> the compact components with uc  hii  regions are usually smaller and denser than those without uc  hii  regions . for individual sources , </S>",
    "<S> we derive the spectral types ( o7@xmath4o4 ) of the ionizing stars and the fractions of uv photons absorbed by dust within the nebulae , which are significantly different from previous estimates based on the uc  hii  regions alone .    </S>",
    "<S> our recombination line observations show that the ultracompact , compact , and extended components have approximately the same velocity in the individual sources with one exception ( g25.72 + 0.05 ) , implying that they are physically associated . </S>",
    "<S> the compact components in each object appear to ionized by separate sources , while the uc  hii  regions and their associated compact components are likely to be ionized by the same sources on the basis of the morphological relations mentioned above . </S>",
    "<S> this suggests that almost all of the observed uc  hii  regions are not ` real ' uc  hii  regions and that their actual ages are much greater than their dynamical age ( @xmath510@xmath6  yr ) . </S>",
    "<S> we find that most of simple uc  hii  regions previously known have large ratios of single - dish to vla fluxes , similar to our sources . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the ` age problem ' of uc  hii  regions does not seem to be as serious as earlier studies argued . </S>",
    "<S> we present a simple model in which the coexistence of the ultracompact , compact , and extended components for a long ( @xmath710@xmath8  yr ) time is easily explained by combining the champagne flow model with the hierarchical structure of massive star - forming regions . </S>",
    "<S> the well - known relation between the density and diameter of hii  regions , @xmath9  d@xmath10 , is a natural consequence of the hierarchical structure according to our model . </S>",
