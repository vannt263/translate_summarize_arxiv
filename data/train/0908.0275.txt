    "magnetic field effects are not important in the work here and can be safely neglected .",
    "m.[fig : eit43s ] ]    in the thinner regions of the wedge , @xmath54 m , the wall interactions dominate the dephasing and also shift the rydberg state energy .",
    "there are two components to the forces that the rydberg atoms experience due to the presence of the wall @xcite .",
    "first , there is the interaction of the atom with its image .",
    "this interaction essentially takes into account the boundary conditions on the electromagnetic field due to the quartz wall .",
    "it is @xmath55mhz for 43s and @xmath56mhz for 32s at r@xmath57 m @xcite , where r is the distance between the wall and atom .",
    "secondly , the rydberg atom can couple resonantly to the surface polariton modes of the quartz . as this interaction depends on the microscopic properties of the quartz ,",
    "a detailed estimate of its size is beyond the scope of this paper and will be the subject of an additional work in the near future .",
    "the interaction with surface polariton modes can be large for rydberg atoms because the energy intervals between dipole coupled rydberg states can match those of far infrared active polariton modes .",
    "it is therefore important to chose a rydberg state and microcell material so that the resonant couplings between the rydberg state and polariton modes , including those from thermally excited polaritons , are minimized in order to maximize the coherence time of the atoms in a microcell . in our experiment , minimization of the overlap between the resonances of the dielectric and the rydberg atoms is the essential point that allows for coherence times of roughly @xmath58ns even at a cell thickness of @xmath53 m .",
    "the 43s state data exhibits strong effects from its interaction with the quartz walls , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eit43s ] . at a cell temperature of @xmath59 and a reservoir temperature of @xmath60",
    "we observed line broadenings up to @xmath61 and a shift of @xmath62mhz at a cell thickness of @xmath63 .",
    "we attribute this behavior to a strong interaction with surface polaritons .",
    "note that some surface polariton modes are thermally excited at @xmath59 .",
    "these modes can lead to other second order energy exchange pathways between rydberg states where one polariton can be annihilated and another one can be created .",
    "these thermally activated pathways are enabled by transitions with smaller differences in principle quantum number and therefore possess larger dipole transition matrix elements .",
    "a spectrum as a function of wedge thickness for the 32s state is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eit32s ] .",
    "in contrast to the 43s data , we observed narrow and only marginally shifted eit lines all the way down to @xmath64 , fig .",
    "[ fig : eit43s ] .",
    "the linewidths were @xmath65mhz and the maximum shift was @xmath66 at a cell temperature of @xmath67 .",

    "these conditions are the same as for the 43s measurement .",
    "32s has the smallest coupling to the walls that we have observed so far .",
    "we attribute this result to the fact that the 32s state has the fewest overlaps between its allowed dipole transitions and infrared active transitions between polariton states .",
    "the differences between the 32s and the 43s states can not be explained by the scaling of the respective dipole moments . a plot of the 43s data scaled according to the n@xmath68 dependence @xcite of the interaction due to the different dipole moments is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : eit43s ] .",

    "[ fig : eit32s ] ]    the 41d state shows additional evidence for the presence of resonant wall interactions , fig .",
    "[ fig:41dstate ] .",
    "the interaction of the atom with its image does not depend on polarization @xcite .",
    "the resonant interaction that involves atoms interacting with the surface polaritons is polarization dependent because of the dipole selection rules that govern the allowed transitions for energy exchange with the wall . for the 41d state",
    "we have observed a gap and temperature dependent splitting of the m@xmath70 sublevels of each of its fine structure components , fig .",
    "[ fig:41dstate ] .",
    "we observe one group of states that is shifted and broadened similar to the 43s state , whereas other states at the same time are not affected .",
    "this can not be explained by a boltzmann factor weighting of the dominant dipole transition .",
    "the temperature dependence of the dominant dipole transition is very weak over the small range of temperatures we investigated , @xmath3 .",
    "the fact that different m@xmath70 states have different behavior supports our statement that the resonant wall interactions are important since this has to result from a polarization dependent interaction .",
    "similar observations were obtained for the 30d state .",
    "m. [ fig:41dstate ] ]    further systematic investigations of the details of the atom wall coupling are clearly necessary and are the subject of further studies . however , the fact that it is possible to observe rydberg atoms with linewidths and shifts on the @xmath71 level is very encouraging for further investigations toward collective coherent quantum dynamics in microcells .",
    "the data leads us to the conclusion that the overlap between the polariton resonances of the walls and the rydberg atoms have to be reduced to obtain a coherence time such that it is possible to realize rydberg atom blockade in a microcell .",
    "to summarize , we have measured the dephasing and energy level shifts experienced by rydberg states in microcells with thicknesses on the order of @xmath4 using eit . for 43s",
    "we observed a significant wall induced line shift and broadening .",
    "the magnitude of these effects in the @xmath72 region of the cell prevented us from obtaining a suitable signal for coherent spectroscopy .",
    "for the 41d state we observed a group of states strongly coupled to the surface and another one that remained narrow - evidence for a dark state with respect to the atom wall coupling .",
    "we obtained our best results for the 32s state .",
    "this state does not have resonant overlap with the known polariton lines of quartz @xcite and we observe an eit signal that is suitable for coherent manipulations of the dynamics in the @xmath73 region of the cell .",
    "the frequency shifts and line broadening are only on the order of a few @xmath74 .",
    "this is significantly less than the bandwidth required for collective coherent dynamics in a thermal vapor cell as discussed in the introduction of this paper .",
    "therefore we expect that collective coherent dynamics are possible in a thermal microcell .",
    "our measurement is encouraging for further investigations that are necessary for realizing single photon sources and other quantum devices based on rydberg atom blockade in thermal microcells .",
    "the significant achievement of this study is the demonstration that there are rydberg states that can have long enough coherence times to take advantage of the dipole blockade effect in thermal microcells .",
    "in contrast to collective dynamics involving electronic transitions , for example rydberg states , the collective dynamics of nuclear spin states are expected to have a significantly longer coherence time , especially if spin protective coatings or buffer gas loaded cells are used .",
    "future studies will utilize cells that make use of conductive coatings to eliminate residual electric field effects and ones coated and filled with buffer gas to enhance the coherence times of nuclear spin states .",
    "optimized cell materials and surface structures can also be used to minimize the interactions of polaritons and rydberg atoms .",
    "the cell was fabricated from two quartz optical flats ( herasil 1 ) of thickness of @xmath75 , cut to a size of @xmath76 . to form the cell , a spacer of @xmath77 thickness is placed between the flats to make a 5@xmath30 cm long wedge with a maximum gap of 500@xmath18 m .",
    "all the edges of the wedge , except the one where the spacer is placed , are sealed by fusing the glass .",
    "next , the spacer is removed and a tube is connected to the open side of the wedge and the wedge is sealed .",
    "the cell is pumped through the tube to pressures below @xmath78 , the tube is partially filled with rb and is finally sealed off .",
    "the tube acts as the reservoir .",
    "the oven used to heat the wedge has 2 windows so that the light used for the experiment can pass through the cell .",
    "this oven heats the wedge uniformly without obstructing optical access .",
    "the rb density is monitored by absorption measurements on the rb @xmath79 transition . from fits of the absorption spectra",
    "we were able to reproduce the wedge temperature to within @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , we were able to control the rb density and optical density in the wedged cell .",
    "the coupling and probe beams pass through the oven windows , optical flats and vapor in a counter propagating geometry , essentially normal to the surface of the cell , fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the position of the beams along the wedge can be changed by moving the cell in and out of the oven heating the wedge on a translation stage .",
    "this allows the thickness of the gap and consequently the rb vapor to be set for a given experiment .",
    "the accuracy of the cell thickness is better than @xmath81 m .",
    "the probe laser has a power of 16@xmath18w and is focussed to a beam waist of @xmath82 .",
    "the coupling laser has a power of 800@xmath18w for 32s and is focussed to a beam waist of @xmath83 .",
    "the laser - matter interaction region is cylindrical with a diameter of 193@xmath84 and length equal to the size of the wedge gap .",
    "the rayleigh ranges of the focussed beams are much longer than the cell gap width for all the data presented here .",
    "the coupling laser has a bandwidth of 2@xmath30mhz over a ms timescale .",
    "the probe laser bandwidth is approximately the same .",
    "the coupling laser bandwidth is more important because the rydberg linewidth is narrow compared to the laser bandwidth , thus reducing the effective rabi frequency delivered on the coupling transition .",
    "the reference cell is a @xmath38 long rb vapor cell in co- and counter propagating laser geometry . to determine the reference signal ,",
    "a fraction of the probe laser is shifted with an aom 200@xmath30mhz to supply the probe light for the reference cell .",
    "the coupling laser light used in the reference cell is derived from the same source as that in the thin cell .",
    "this light is frequency shifted 200@xmath30mhz and amplitude modulated at 100@xmath30khz with a @xmath85 phase shift relative to that used for experiments in the thin cell .",
    "a second lock - in amplifier is used for this setup .",
    "the co- and counter - propagating eit signals provide a well defined calibration of the frequency via the differential doppler effect .",
    "additionally , each scan is triggered on the counter - propagating signal to provide a stable locking point for the averaging of the scans .",
    "the stark shifts for alkali - atom rydberg states are well known and there are highly accurate methods to compute them @xcite .",
    "consequently , the field inside the cell can be estimated by measuring the line splitting of a d state or the shift of an s state .",
    "we observed a wall distance dependent line splitting for the 41d state from which we determined the electric field to be @xmath86 at @xmath53 m wedge gap .",
    "the measured electric field depended linearly on the wedge gap which is evidence that the charges were on the surfaces of the wedge .",
    "this measurement was done in the larger , @xmath87 m , sections of the wedge to avoid mixing the stark shift caused by the surface charges with the interaction between the dielectric wall and the rydberg atoms .",
    "in addition , for the 32s state , which was observed to have a weak interaction with the walls , we observed only a small shift . this data places an upper limit on the electric field in the @xmath88 m part of the wedge at @xmath404@xmath30v@xmath30cm@xmath37 , consistent with the electric field measurement performed using the 41d state splittings .",
    "this estimate is an upper limit since it attributes all the observed shift to an electric field .",
    "a third piece of data that supports our field measurements is the fact that we do not observe the blue shift of the m@xmath89 41d@xmath90 or the m@xmath89 41d@xmath48 states . from the 41d stark map",
    "this observation indicates that the field is smaller than 1.2@xmath30v@xmath30cm@xmath37 at a gap of @xmath91 m and suggests that the other measurements are upper bounds and in fact the electric field may be smaller .",
