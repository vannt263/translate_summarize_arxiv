    "in the course of learning a spatial environment , an animal forms an internal representation of space that enables spatial navigation and planning @xcite .",
    "the hippocampus plays a key role in producing this map through the activity of location - specific place cells @xcite . at the neurophysiological level",
    ", these place cells exhibit spatially selective spiking activity . as the animal navigates its environment , the place cell fires only at a discrete location ",
    "its place field ( figure  [ pcs]a - b ) .",
    "it is believed that the entire ensemble of place cells serves as a neuronal basis of the animal s spatial awareness @xcite .",
    "remarkably , place cells spike not only during active navigation but also during quiescent wake states @xcite and even during sleep @xcite .",
    "for example , the animal can `` replay '' place cells in sequences that correspond to the physical routes traversed during active navigation @xcite or `` preplay '' sequences that represent possible future trajectories , either in direct or reversed order , while pausing at a decision point @xcite .",
    "this phenomenon implies that , after learning , the animal can explore and retrieve spatial information by cuing the hippocampal network @xcite , which may in turn be viewed as a physiological correlate of `` mental exploration '' @xcite .",
    "it bears noting , however , that the actual functional units for spatial information processing in the hippocampal network are not individual cells but repeatedly activated groups of place cells known as cell assemblies ( see @xcite and figure  [ pcs]c ) .",
    "although the physiological properties of the place cell assemblies remain largely unknown , it is believed that the cells constituting an assembly synaptically drive a certain readout unit downstream from the hippocampus . in the `` reader - centric '' view , this readout neuron  a small network or , most likely , a single neuron  is what actually defines the cell assembly , by actualizing the information provided by its activity @xcite .",
    "the identity of the readout neurons in some cases is suggested by the network s anatomy .",
    "for example , there are direct many - to - one projections from the ca3 region of the hippocampus to the ca1 region .",
    "since replays are believed to be initiated in ca3 @xcite , this implies that the ca1 place cells may serve as the readout neurons for the activity of the ca3 place cells . assuming that contemporaneous spiking of place cells implies overlap of their respective place fields ( figure  [ pcs]a - b )",
    ", it is possible to decode the rat s current location from the ongoing spiking activity of a mere 40 - 50 neurons @xcite .",
    "this suggests that the readout neurons may be wired to encode spatial connectivity between place fields by responding to place cell coactivity ( see figure  [ pcs]a - c and @xcite ) .",
    "a natural assumption underlying both the trajectory reconstructing algorithms @xcite and various path integration models @xcite is that the representation of spatial locations during physical navigation is reproducible .",
    "if the rat begins locomotion at a certain location and at a certain moment of time , @xmath0 , and then returns to the same location at a later time , @xmath1 , then the population activity of the place cells at @xmath0 and @xmath1 is the same .",
    "similarly , if spatial information is consistently represented during replays , then the activity packet in the hippocampal network should be restored upon  replaying \" a closed path . whereas the correspondence between place cell activity and spatial locations ( i.e. , place fields ) during physical navigation is enforced by sensory and proprioceptive inputs @xcite",
    ", the consistency of spatial representation during replay must be attributable solely to the network s internal dynamics @xcite .    here",
    "we develop a model that accounts for how a neuronal network could maintain consistency of spatial information over the course of multiple replays or preplays .",
    "this model is based on the discrete differential geometry theory developed in @xcite , which reveals that key geometric concepts can be expressed in purely combinatoric terms .",
    "the choice of this theory is driven in part by recent work that indicates that the hippocampus provides a topological framework for spatial information rather than a geometric or cartesian map @xcite .",
    "the results suggest that to maintain consistency of spatial information during path replay , the synaptic connections between the place cells and the readout neurons must adhere to a zero holonomy principle .    ,",

    "the two red rectangles mark the periods during which the cells are coactive @xcite . *",
    "b. * the gold , green and blue areas represent place fields .",
    "place cell firing rate is maximal at the center of the place field and attenuates towards its periphery ; this pattern can be closely approximated by gaussian distribution .",
    "place cell cofiring reflects overlap between respective place fields : cells @xmath4 and @xmath2 are coactive in the location @xmath5 , cells @xmath2 and @xmath3 are coactive in the location @xmath6 and so on .",

    "* the simplicial model of the cell assembly network*. a convenient framework for representing a population of place cell assemblies is provided by simplicial topology @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "an assembly of @xmath8 place cells , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , ... , @xmath11 , is represented by a @xmath12dimensional abstract simplex ( not to be confused with a geometric simplex ) containing @xmath8 vertexes , @xmath13 $ ] , where each vertex , @xmath14 , corresponds to a place cell @xmath15 ( in the following , the same symbol `` @xmath16 '' will be used to denote a cell assembly and the simplex that represents it ) @xcite .",
    "the entire network can then be represented by a purely combinatorial simplicial complex @xmath17 @xcite whose _ maximal _ simplexes correspond to place cell assemblies @xcite .",
    "simplexes in @xmath17 may overlap : physiological studies demonstrate that a given place cell may be a part of many cell assemblies @xcite .",
    "many authors have suggested that place cell assemblies should overlap significantly in order to better represent contiguous spatial locations @xcite : the more cells shared by @xmath18 and @xmath19 , the closer the encoded locations are to one another .",
    "the most detailed representation of the environment is produced by a population of maximally overlapping cell assemblies , which differ by a single cell . in such case ,",
    "a transition of the activity from one cell assembly @xmath18 to another @xmath19 occurs when one place cell in @xmath18 turns off and another cell in the new assembly @xmath20 turns on .",
    "the resulting simplicial complex @xmath17 has the structure of a combinatorial @xmath21-dimensional simplicial manifold ( in the literature also referred to as `` pure complex '' or `` pseudomanifold '' , @xcite ) .",
    "* population activity in the cell assembly complex @xmath17*. the simplicial complex @xmath17 is a convenient instrument for relating place cell coactivity to the topology of the rat s environment @xcite .",
    "the rat s movements in the physical environment induce a packet of place cell activity that propagates in the hippocampal network  an `` activity bump '' @xcite . in our model",
    "the propagation of the activity bump corresponds to an `` active simplex '' propagating through @xmath17 .",
    "the resulting population activity vector is then @xmath22 where the first component @xmath23 represents the spiking rate of the readout neuron , and @xmath24 denotes the spiking rate of the place cell @xmath15 within the assembly @xmath16 .",
    "roughly speaking , @xmath24 can be viewed as the firing rate of @xmath15 at the location where the place fields of the cells constituting the assembly @xmath16 overlap , which we refer to as the cell assembly field , @xmath25 ( the domain @xmath7 on figure  [ pcs]b ) .",
    "a given place cell @xmath15 is a part of many cell assemblies @xmath26 , whose fields @xmath27 are contained in the @xmath15 s place field ; thus , the higher the orders of the cell assemblies , the ( statistically ) smaller the @xmath25s @xcite .",
    "since the individual place cell spiking rates are well approximated by smooth gaussian functions of the rat s coordinates @xcite , the quantities @xmath24 remain approximately constant over @xmath25 .",
    "the components of the population activity vector ( [ act ] ) in a given cell assembly can then be related to the corresponding place cells maximal firing rates @xmath28 by a set of factors @xmath29 , that are specific to a given cell and a given cell assembly , @xmath30 which may be viewed as measures of the separation between the location @xmath25 and the respective place fields centers ( figure  [ pcs]b ) . in other words ,",
    "the coefficients @xmath31 provide a discrete description of the place field map s geometry .",
    "as the rat moves from one cell assembly field to another ( e.g. , from @xmath32 to @xmath33 ) , the activity packet in @xmath17 shifts from the maximal simplex @xmath18 to the maximal simplex @xmath19 , then to @xmath34 , and so on , tracing a `` simplicial path , '' @xmath35 ( these are  thick paths \" in the terminology of @xcite ) . as a result , every path @xmath36 in the rat s physical environment corresponds to a simplicial path @xmath37 , which can be viewed as an abstract representation of the place cell trajectory code used in @xcite .",
    "however , in order to represent the path @xmath38 in the hippocampal network , the activity of each place cell assembly @xmath39 should activate the corresponding readout neuron @xmath40 .",
    "thus , during the activation period , the net input from the presynaptic cells in @xmath16 should exceed the corresponding readout neuron s firing threshold @xmath41 , @xmath42 where the coefficients @xmath43 represent the strengths of synaptic connections between the place cells and the readout neuron @xcite .",
    "in other words , this is a rate model in that the activity of cells is described by a single parameter : the firing rate , @xmath44 , related via coefficients @xmath45 to the maximal rate ( [ fsig ] ) .",
    "if the network is trained the synaptic architecture is fixed , place fields are stable  then each cell assembly fires when the rat visits ( or replays ) a specific spot where the respective place fields overlap .",
    "because this spot is very small compared to the size of place fields , the left side of ( [ wf ] ) is the essentially the same every time .    using ( [ fsig ] ) , the condition ( [ wf ] ) becomes @xmath46 where the variables @xmath47 and @xmath48 are defined on all simplexes ( i.e. , all cell assemblies ) , and the variable @xmath44 on the vertexes ( i.e. , place cell ) .",
    "* dressed cell assembly complex @xmath49*. the coefficients @xmath50 can be regarded as characteristics of the maximal simplexes of @xmath17 and the values @xmath28 as characteristics of its vertexes .",
    "together , these parameters produce a  dressing \" of the cell assembly complex with physiological information about the cells spiking and the network s synaptic architecture .",
    "equation ( [ th ] ) singles out a set @xmath51 of _ valid _ dressings , @xmath52 which enable readout neurons to respond to presynaptic activity and thus defines the scope of working synaptic architectures of the place cell assembly networks .",
    "replays occur on a millisecond time scale and produce only a few spikes per activity period @xcite ( figure  [ pcs]d ) , which is comparable to the stochastic background activity of neurons . in order to distinguish cell assembly activation from the assembly s background activity",
    ", the readout neuron should be tuned to a particular combination of inputs ; the physiological process most likely involves gating specific parts of the dendritic tree by timed inputs from the presynaptic cells . here",
    ", the model employs a simplified version of this process : we propose that the readout neuron should remain in a sensitive , near - threshold state @xcite that allows it to quickly respond to the cell assembly during each individual step of replay .",
    "thus , we hypothesize that during replays the inequality ( [ th ] ) may be approximated by the equation @xmath53 which further restricts the set of valid dressings to a special marginal set @xmath54 , for which spontaneous replays of place cell assemblies are possible . note , however , that equation ( [ q ] ) does not fix the values of the parameters @xmath28 and @xmath50 , and so it allows a significant variability of spiking activity and of the synaptic connection strengths . to emphasize the assumption that place cell activity during replays elicits a response from the readout neuron at a constant rate @xmath55 , it is convenient to use the notation @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a fixed parameter that can be interpreted as the readout neuron s susceptibility to discharge .     * propagation of place cell activity along simplicial paths*. * a. * the firing rate of the cell @xmath2 , required to activate the readout neuron of the cell assembly @xmath18 ,",
    "can be inferred from the firing rates of the other two cells , @xmath58 and @xmath4 using the equation ( [ v2eq ] ) ( red arrow over @xmath18 ) .",
    "the the resulting rate @xmath59 of @xmath2 and the rate @xmath60 of @xmath58 define the rate @xmath61 of the cell @xmath3 required to activate the readout neuron in the next cell assembly @xmath19 according to the equation ( [ v2sol1 ] ) ( red arrow over the @xmath20 ) . *",
    "b. * a network of maximally overlapping cell assemblies is represented by a simplicial manifold @xmath49 .",

    "if equation ( [ q ] ) holds over @xmath18 , then the readout neuron @xmath69 fires with the rate @xmath70 in response to the coactivity of @xmath4 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath71 suppose that equation ( [ q ] ) also holds for an adjacent ( maximally overlapping ) cell assembly , represented by an adjacent simplex @xmath72 $ ] , so that the second readout neuron @xmath73 fires with the rate @xmath74 @xmath75 a key observation here is that , since @xmath19 shares vertexes @xmath76 and @xmath77 with @xmath18 , the corresponding firing rates @xmath67 and @xmath68 in ( [ v2eq ] ) define uniquely the firing rate of the remaining cell , @xmath78 , required to activate the readout neuron @xmath73 ( fig .  [ thickpath]a ) , @xmath79 similarly , if there is another @xmath65 simplex @xmath80 $ ] adjacent to @xmath19 , then , once the value @xmath78 is found from ( [ v2sol1 ] ) , the firing rate at @xmath81 can be obtained from @xmath68 and @xmath78 , and so on ( figure  [ thickpath]b ) .",
    "in other words , once the synaptic connections @xmath82 are specified for all simplexes , equation ( [ q ] ) can be used to describe the conditions for transferring the activity vector @xmath83 over the entire complex @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "notice however , that equations ( [ v1eq])-([v2sol1 ] ) do not specify the mechanism responsible for generating place cell activity ; they only describe the conditions required to ignite the cell assemblies in a particular sequence .",
    "while the subsequent simplexes @xmath84 and @xmath85 in the simplicial path ( [ g ] ) are not necessarily adjacent , the activity according to equation ( [ q ] ) is propagated along a sequence of adjacent maximal simplexes , such as depicted in figure  [ thickpath]b .    *",

    "the @xmath110 dimensional pivot simplex @xmath111 shown in red carries the curvature coefficients @xmath112 . ]",
    "mathematically , a mismatch between the starting and the ending orientation of the population activity vector is akin to the differential - geometric notion of holonomy which , on riemannian manifolds , measures the change of a vector s orientation as a result of a parallel transport around a closed loop @xcite .",
    "hence , the requirement ( [ prod1 ] ) that the activity vector should be the same after completing a closed simplicial trajectory implies that the discrete holonomy along paths in @xmath49 should vanish .    * discrete curvature*. in differential geometry , zero holonomy on a riemannian manifold",
    "is achieved by requiring that the riemannian curvature tensor @xmath113 associated with the connection @xmath114 vanishes at every point @xmath115 @xcite .",

    "the difference between the starting and the ending orientations of @xmath116 defines the curvature at the point @xmath115 @xcite .",
    "an analogous procedure can be performed on a discrete manifold @xmath49 .",
    "however , there is a natural limit to shrinking simplicial paths : in a @xmath21-dimensional complex , the tightest simplicial paths consist of @xmath12dimensional simplexes @xmath117 which intersect the same @xmath108 dimensional face ( see figure  [ holonomy]b ) .",
    "such a path @xmath118 we will call an `` elementary closed path '' , following @xcite .",

    "the product of the matrices @xmath89 encircling the pivot @xmath111 ( figure  [ holonomy]b ) has the same form as equation ( [ mgamma ] ) ; however , the coefficients @xmath124 at the bottom row of the matrix @xmath125 can be viewed as the curvatures defined at @xmath122 .",
    "thus , to ensure zero holonomies , the conditions @xmath126 @xmath127 , ... , @xmath8 , must be imposed on the connection coefficients @xmath50 at every pivot simplex @xmath122 of a @xmath21-dimensional dressed cell assembly simplicial complex .",
    "for example , an elementary @xmath65 closed path encircling a vertex @xmath128 with @xmath95 simplexes enumerated as shown on figure  [ holonomy]c yields the holonomy matrix @xmath129 the values @xmath130 , @xmath127 , @xmath131 , @xmath132 , of the bottom row that distinguish @xmath133 from the unit matrix should be considered as discrete curvatures defined at the pivot vertex @xmath128 ( see figure  [ holonomy]c and @xcite ) , which need to vanish in order to ensure a consistent representation of space during replays .",
    "since there exists a finite number of pivot simplexes , the number of constraints ( [ curv ] ) on a given dressing @xmath134 is finite .",
    "thus , the scope of nontrivial zero holonomy conditions ( [ prod1 ] ) drastically reduces and the task of ensuring consistency of translations of the population activity vectors over @xmath49 becomes tractable .",
    "nevertheless , zero curvature conditions ( [ curv ] ) are in general quite restrictive and impose nontrivial constraints on the synaptic architecture of the place cell assemblies . as the simplest illustration ,",
    "consider the case when the firing rates of all the place cells and readout neurons are the same : @xmath135 , and all the connection strengths from the place cells to the readout neuron in all cell assemblies are identical : @xmath136 , giving a constant connection dressing @xmath137 .",
    "it can be shown that in this case the resulting transfer matrix is idempotent , that is @xmath138 , so that the zero curvature condition ( [ curv ] ) is satisfied identically for the even order elementary closed paths and can not be satisfied if the paths order is odd . under more general and physiologically more plausible assumptions equation ( [ curv ] ) does not necessarily restrict the order of the cell assemblies .",
    "however , the domain of permissible dressings , @xmath54 is significantly restricted by ( [ curv ] ) , as compared to the domain occupied by the synaptic parameters of the unconstrained cell assembly networks .",
    "the zero curvature constraints ( [ curv ] ) affect the net statistics of the synaptic weights .",
    "since the structure of the full space of marginal dressings @xmath139 and of the corresponding probability measures is too complex , we considered a family of connections parametrized as @xmath140 in which the fluctuations @xmath141 are normally distributed , @xmath142 in the absence of zero curvature constraints , cell assemblies are uncoupled and the synaptic fluctuations are statistically independent , so that the joint probability distribution of @xmath141 is @xmath143 under zero - curvature conditions ( [ curv ] ) the parameters of the synaptic architecture are coupled ( figure  [ coupling ] ) and the probability distribution for a particular variable @xmath141 is obtained by averaging the joint distribution ( [ indep ] ) under delta - constraints : @xmath144 where @xmath145 is the normalization constant and @xmath146 denotes integration over all @xmath147 .    in the appendix",
    "it is demonstrated that for weak fluctuations , the shape of the distribution ( [ gauss ] ) remains gaussian , @xmath148 but its width decreases : @xmath149 .",
    "thus , zero curvature conditions narrow the distribution of the uncorrelated weights , i.e. , produce a  tuning \" of the synaptic connections @xmath82 .",
    "this result also applies to the synaptic weights : in cases where the place fields are distributed regularly , so that the coefficients @xmath31 have a well defined mean , @xmath150 , and a small multiplicative variance , @xmath151 @xmath152 , the coefficients @xmath153 are approximately defined by the ratios of the synaptic weights , @xmath154 and therefore the zero curvature conditions produce the same effect on @xmath155 as on @xmath82 , i.e. , reduce the variability of synaptic weights .",
    "understanding the effects produced by zero curvature constraints ( [ curv ] ) on a wider range of fluctuations is mathematically more challenging .",
    "the qualitative results obtained here , however , may generalize beyond the limit of small multiplicative synaptic noise and could eventually be experimentally verified .",
    "a physiological implication of the result ( [ tune ] ) is that the distribution of the unconstrained synaptic weights in a network that does not encode a representation of space ( e.g. , measured _ in vitro _ ) should be broader than the distribution measured _ in vivo _ in healthy animals , which can be tested once such measurements become technically possible .",
    "the task of encoding a consistent map of the environment imposes a system of constraints on the hippocampal network ( i.e. , on the coefficients @xmath82 ) that enforce the correspondence between place cell activity and the animal s location in the physical world .",
    "here we show that zero holonomy is a key condition , which is implemented by requiring that curvatures vanish at the pivot simplexes .",
    "this approach works within a combinatorial framework , but a similar intuition guided a geometric approach @xcite , where the place cells ability to encode the location of the animal  but not the path leading to that location  was achieved by imposing the conditions of stoke s theorem @xcite on the synaptic weights of the hippocampal network , which were viewed as functions of cartesian coordinates .",
    "our model is based on the same requirement of path - invariance of place cell population activity , implemented on a discrete representation of space  a dressed abstract simplicial complex @xmath49without involving geometric information about the animal s environment .    in particular , note that the concepts of `` curvature '' and `` holonomy '' are defined in combinatorial , not geometric , terms .",
    "this is an advantage in light of ( and indeed was motivated by ) recent work indicating that the hippocampus provides a topological framework for spatial experience rather than cartesian map of the environment @xcite , and it also makes our model somewhat more realistic .",
    "it does , however , lead to a number of technical complications .",
    "for example , discrete connections ( [ b ] ) defined over @xmath49 are nonabelian @xcite , so using the approach of @xcite would require a nontrivial generalization of stoke s theorem , which is valid only in spaces with abelian differential - geometric connections @xcite .",
    "our approach is based on the analysis of discrete holonomies suggested in the pioneering work of @xcite which , in fact , explains the mathematical underpinning of the stoke s theorem approach in both abelian and nonabelian cases @xcite .",
    "indeed , the zero - holonomy constraint ensures that no matter what direction the activity is propagated in the network ( forward , backward , or skipping over some cell assemblies ) , the integrity of the spatial information remains intact .",
    "* generality of the approach*. a key instrument of our analyses is equation ( [ q ] ) , which describes the conditions necessary for propagating spiking conditions over the cell assembly network .",
    "the exact form of this equation is not essential ",
    "a physiologically more detailed description of near - threshold neuronal spiking @xcite could be used to establish more accurate zero holonomy and curvature constraints on the hippocampal network s synaptic architecture , which should be viewed as a general requirement for any spatial replay model .",
    "the assumption of maximally - overlapping place cell assemblies may also be relaxed , since equation ( [ q ] ) can be applied in cases where the order of the cell assemblies varies , that is , when the simplicial complex @xmath49 is not a manifold but a quasimanifold ( see figure  [ qmanif ] and @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , implementing the `` zero holonomy '' principle in this case would require rather arduous combinatorial analysis .",
    "for example , propagating the activity packets using ( [ kk ] ) would impose relationships between the dimensionalities of the maximal simplexes and their placement in @xmath49 , i.e. , require a particular cell assembly network architecture .     * a replay in simplicial quasimanifold*. an example of a simplicial quasi - manifold containing @xmath65 and @xmath156 simplexes .",
    "the activity of cells in the @xmath156 simplexes is induced from the @xmath65 simplexes approaching its sides .",
    "two simplicial paths are shown by gray triangles , marked by red dotted lines . ]    * learning the constraints*. in this paper , the requirements ( [ prod1 ] ) and ( [ curv ] ) enforcing path consistency of place cell replay are imposed on a fully trained network : it is assumed that the place fields have had time to stabilize @xcite and that the cell assemblies with constant weights @xmath43 have had time to form @xcite . in a more realistic approach",
    ", these constraints should modulate the hippocampal network s training process .",
    "for example , if the unconstrained network is trained by minimizing a certain cost functional @xmath157 @xcite then the constraints ( [ curv ] ) would contribute an additional  curvature term \" @xmath158 , @xmath159 defined , e.g. , via lagrange multipliers @xmath160 , @xmath161    physiologically , the network may be trained by `` ringing out '' the violations of the conditions ( [ curv ] ) in the neuronal circuit , i.e. , by replaying sequences and adapting the synaptic weights to get rid of the centers of non - vanishing holonomy .",
    "curiously , the role played by @xmath158 in ( [ action ] ) resembles the role played by the curvature term in the hilbert ",
    "einstein action of general relativity theory @xcite , which ensures that , in the absence of gravitational field sources , the solution of the hilbert ",
    "einstein equations describes a flat space - time . by analogy , the constraints imposed by ( [ curv ] )",
    "may be viewed as conditions that enforce `` synaptic flatness '' of the hippocampal cognitive map .",
    "it is worth noting that the mechanism suggested here is an implementation of the zero holonomy condition in this simplest case of the reader - centric cell assembly theory that is consistent with physiology .",
    "the place cell readout might involve , instead of a single neuron , a small network of a few neurons ( not yet identified experimentally ) , which might require a different implementation of zero holonomy principle , depending on the specific architecture of such a network .",
