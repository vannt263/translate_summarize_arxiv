    "it has been observed that the momentum distribution of particles created in heavy ion collisions is not azimuthally symmetric in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction .",
    "this dominant asymmetry , the elliptic flow , is the result of several factors , the main one being the anisotropy of the initial configuration after the collision due to the non - zero impact parameter .",
    "the elliptic flow is typically characterized using the second coefficient of the fourier expansion of the momentum distribution , @xmath0 .",
    "it was found in experiments @xcite that the @xmath0 parameter as a function of the transverse momentum , @xmath1 , scales with the number of constituent quarks , @xmath2 , in a hadron .",
    "that is , if the @xmath3 curves are re - scaled according to the constituent quark number of the considered hadron species , and @xmath4 is plotted as function of @xmath5 for each type of hadron with mass @xmath6 , the curves will coincide .",
    "later results showed that the scaling is more precise if @xmath0 is plotted as a function of the transverse kinetic energy , @xmath7 , instead of the transverse momentum @xmath8 .",
    "this experimentally found scaling law is remarkably simple , and indicates that the elliptic flow develops before the quarks recombine into hadrons .",
    "therefore , understanding the factors influencing the measurable @xmath0 can provide information about the state of the quak gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "the fluid dynamical ( fd ) model describes the dynamical development of the qgp from the ( already thermalized ) initial state until the break - down of the equilibrium , where first the chemical equilibrium among quarks and anti - quarks ceases .",
    "initially the plasma has only two flavors , u and d , and thus the fd model assumes two flavors .",
    "however , the flavor equilibration in the plasma is a rapid process with a timescale of the order of @xmath9 , so by the end of the fd development a flavor equilibrium among three flavors , u , d , and s , is reached .",
    "our usual fd evolution does not take into account this chemical change of flavors with an additional rate equation , instead this process is taken into account at the final stage of the fd development , when the subsequent eos is already assumed to have three equilibrated flavors .",
    "energy and momentum conservation and the requirement of non - decreasing entropy is enforced in the transition , from the ideal qgp state to the state where quark and anti - quark numbers are frozen out . as a consequence ,",
    "the mass change of the quarks starts in the initial qgp with two flavors , and we use this approximation to estimate in section ii.b the final boundary where the initial fd stage of the evolution ends , with light quark masses .",
    "we consider a model of hadronization and investigate the constituent quark number scaling ( qns ) of the @xmath0 parameter . in this model ,",
    "a gas of quarks and anti - quarks expands in a background field represented by the bag constant @xmath10 , which depends on density and temperature of the expanding fireball .",
    "initially this @xmath10-field includes the energy of the deconfined perturbative vacuum and of the gluon fields .",
    "as the system expands the deconfinement starts and the average @xmath10 decreases .",
    "furthermore , as the chiral symmetry breaking starts , the quarks gain mass .",
    "the quark mass is calculated as a function of the temperature and density of the matter .",
    "the quark gas expands rapidly while the quark mass increases .",
    "this process can be considered as a simple representation of the breaking chiral symmetry and deconfinement in a dynamical transition crossing the quarkyonic phase @xcite .",

    "finally , the @xmath0 parameter is determined using simple two- and three - source models of the elliptic flow and the particle distributions obtained from the hadronization model .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ a ] the density and temperature dependence of constituent quark mass is considered .",
