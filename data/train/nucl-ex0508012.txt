    "the dynamics of the three - nucleon ( 3@xmath0 ) system can be very accurately studied by means of the nucleon - deuteron breakup reaction .",
    "its final state , constrained by only general conservation laws , provides a rich source of information to test the nuclear hamiltonian .",
    "it is of particular importance for components of the models which account for subtle effects , like three - nucleon force ( 3nf ) contributions to the potential energy of the 3@xmath0 system .",
    "precise predictions for observables in the 3@xmath0 system can be obtained via exact solutions of the 3@xmath0 faddeev equations for any nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 ) interaction , even with the inclusion of a 3nf model  @xcite . to investigate details of the dynamics of the 3@xmath0 system , in addition to elastic @xmath3 scattering data , reliable deuteron breakup data sets , covering large regions of the available phase space ,",
    "are needed .",
    "unfortunately , it still remains difficult to perform such measurements at the required level of precision . in our previous paper",
    "@xcite we have started to report results of a project dedicated exactly towards such an aim .",
    "here we continue with the presentation of a systematic set of breakup cross - section values and we compare them with theoretical predictions based on various dynamical assumptions .",
    "properties of few - nucleon systems at not - too - high energies are determined mainly by pairwise nucleon - nucleon interactions .",
    "models of @xmath1 forces describe the long range interaction part according to the meson - exchange picture , while the short range is based on phenomenology , and adjusted by fitting a certain number of parameters to the @xmath1 scattering data .",
    "the present generation of @xmath1 potentials reaches an unprecedented accuracy in describing the @xmath4 and @xmath5 observables below 350 mev , expressed by a @xmath6 per degree of freedom very close to 1 . in few - nucleon studies",
    "the most widely used so - called `` realistic '' @xmath1 potentials are argonne @xmath7 ( av18 )  @xcite , charge dependent ( cd )  bonn  @xcite , nijmegen i and ii ( nijm  i , nijm  ii )  @xcite . their full equivalence with phase shift analysis  @xcite guarantees that all two - body aspects of the interaction are taken into account when",
    "these @xmath1 force models are used in microscopic calculations of few- and many - nucleon systems .    at the more fundamental level of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , the strong force between the nucleons is understood as residual color force .",
    "a direct description of few - nucleon systems at low energy from first principles would require the solution of qcd in the non - perturbative regime which is not possible at present ( except on the lattice ) .",
    "on the other hand , the low - energy dynamics of qcd can be studied in the chiral effective field theory ( eft ) framework .",
    "this is a systematic approach which incorporates the spontaneously broken approximate chiral symmetry of qcd and is based on the most general effective lagrangian for goldstone bosons ( pions in the two - flavor sector of the up and down quarks ) and matter fields ( nucleons , @xmath2resonances , @xmath8 ) . in the pion and single - baryon sectors ,",
    "@xmath9-matrix elements can be calculated in chiral perturbation theory ( chpt ) via an expansion in terms of @xmath10  in powers @xmath11 of a low - momentum scale @xmath12 , associated with small generic external momenta and with the pion ( light - quark ) mass . here ,",
    "small means with respect to the scale @xmath13 , corresponding to the chiral symmetry breaking scale of the order of 1 gev . motivated by successful applications of chpt in the @xmath14 and @xmath15 sectors",
    ", weinberg proposed to extend the formalism to systems with two and more nucleons , where non  perturbative calculations are necessary to deal with the shallow bound states ( or large scattering lengths )  @xcite . according to weinberg ,",
    "chpt can be applied in that case not to the amplitude but to a kernel of the corresponding dynamical equation which may be viewed as an effective nuclear potential .",
    "few - nucleon @xmath9-matrix elements are generated non - perturbatively by iterating the potential in the dynamical equation .",
    "the first application of this approach in the 2n sector was performed in  @xcite . at present , the 2n system has been studied up to next - to - next - to - next - to - leading order ( n@xmath16lo ) in the chiral expansion  @xcite , while the three- and more numerous nucleon systems have so far been analyzed up to next - to - next - to - leading order ( nnlo )  @xcite .",
    "it should be stressed that this approach offers an unique possibility to estimate uncertainties of the theoretically predicted physical quantities .",
    "high - quality models of the @xmath1 potentials , when applied to calculate observables in the 3@xmath0 system , revealed discrepancies between the pure pairwise dynamics and the experimental results .",
    "the most promising and widely investigated explanation is the presence of three - nucleon interactions .",
    "the realistic potentials are therefore supplemented by 3nf models , usually refined versions of the fujita - miyazawa force  @xcite , in which one of the nucleons is excited into an intermediate @xmath2 via a 2@xmath17-exchange between both remaining nucleons .",
    "the most popular version of such an interaction is the urbana ix  @xcite force .",
    "the tucson - melbourne ( tm )  @xcite 3nf extends this picture by allowing for additional processes contributing to the pion rescattering at the intermediate nucleon .",
    "an alternative mechanism of generating a 3nf is based on the so - called explicit @xmath2-isobar excitation  @xcite .",
    "calculations are performed in a coupled - channel approach and the effective 3nf is generated ( together with other @xmath2-isobar effects ) due to the explicit treatment of the degrees of freedom of a single @xmath2 . finally , within the chpt framework",
    "both 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 forces ( as well as nuclear currents ) are derived from the same effective chiral lagrangian and are thus fully consistent with each other .",
    "this leads to a consistent model of the @xmath1 and 3@xmath0 interactions , which also strongly constrains the parameters of the 3nf .",
    "as stated earlier , presently the results in the 3@xmath0 system are only available at nnlo .",
    "the analysis at n@xmath16lo requires sophisticated analytical and numerical calculations .",
    "this work is in progress .",
    "the role of 3nf effects has been recognized already when studying the bound states of three nucleons .",
    "no realistic potential approach can reproduce the binding energies of @xmath16he and @xmath16h when the calculations are based on @xmath1 forces only  @xcite . when 3nf contributions are taken into account , the @xmath16h and @xmath16he binding energies can be described accurately ( by construction , because parameters of the 3nf are usually fitted to match the triton binding ) ",
    "see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "these combined models of @xmath1 and 3@xmath0 forces also describe the @xmath18he binding energy , indicating that 4nf are presumably small  @xcite . for the description of the level schemes of p - shell nuclei , the most simple 3nf s show failures which motivated more sophisticated 3nf models leading to encouraging agreement between theory and experiment  @xcite . here",
    ", we will restrict ourselves only to the models mentioned above . in the isospin @xmath19 = 1/2 state , they are expected to be very similar to the extended versions used in  @xcite . an analogous conclusion is obtained within the chpt framework ",
    "inclusion of 3nf graphs leads to an improved description of few - nucleon bound states  @xcite .",
    "further evidence of relevant consequences originating from introducing additional dynamics into the 3@xmath0 system comes from the coupled - channel approach  the binding energies of @xmath16he and @xmath16h are much closer to the experimental values when the @xmath2-isobar contributions are included and the difference of the two bindings is well matched  @xcite .    presently , the richest evidence for the importance of 3nf effects is deduced from the elastic nucleon - deuteron scattering observables .",
    "the picture emerging from the comparisons of various data with theory is , however , rather ambiguous . in several cases where the @xmath1 forces alone fail to reproduce the observables the inclusion of 3nf s leads to significant improvements  @xcite ( for earlier references c.f .",
    "alas , in several cases discrepancies between the experimental data and theoretical predictions remain , even if the presently available full 3@xmath0 dynamics is taken into account .",
    "this statement is especially true for various polarization observables  @xcite , but holds also for certain cross - section angular distributions ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "those failures , confirmed by different calculational approaches , indicate that the 3nf models are still missing some relevant ingredients , while for the chpt framework they might suggest the necessity for including higher order ( at least n@xmath16lo ) terms for the 3@xmath0 system .",
    "since the theoretical models clearly need more constraints from the experimental data , it is natural to extend the investigations of the 3@xmath0 system to the nucleon - deuteron ( @xmath3 ) breakup reaction .",
    "the continuum of the final states , which has to be simultaneously described in its full richness by the assumed dynamical model of @xmath1 and 3@xmath0 interactions , should provide a lot of information to pin down the details of the theoretical models .",
    "unfortunately , this field has hardly been explored experimentally and only at lower energies , below 30 mev nucleon energy ( see @xcite and @xcite for references ; the most recent results can be found in  @xcite and  @xcite , and in  @xcite at much higher incident energy ) . in the region of intermediate energies",
    " 100 mev ) only at 65 mev several isolated kinematical configurations have been investigated with respect to cross sections and analyzing powers  @xcite .",
    "comparison of those data with the theoretical predictions obtained within the approaches  @xcite discussed above shows again a mixed picture : sometimes the agreement is improved by including 3nf s , in some cases the 3nf effect is negligible and there are cases in which inclusion of 3nf s moves the prediction away from the data . since the thorough theoretical study  @xcite of the full phase space of the breakup reaction shows that significant effects can be expected , there is a strong need for data which precisely and systematically scan large ranges of the final state kinematical variables .",
    "therefore , we have performed a @xmath20h(@xmath21,pp)n breakup experiment using a beam of @xmath22 mev polarized deuterons ( equivalent to 65 mev incident nucleon energy ) .",
    "the experiment has been performed at kvi in groningen , employing a detector setup covering a large fraction of the full breakup phase space .",
    "high precision cross sections together with vector and tensor analyzing powers have been measured in kinematically complete configurations by registering energies and angles of the two outgoing coincident protons .",
    "we have already reported  @xcite a comparison of the first set of the breakup cross sections with realistic @xmath1 forces and 3nf model predictions , finding unambiguously significant effects of the three - nucleon interaction . in this paper",
    "we present an extended breakup cross - section data set for 72 kinematical configurations ( corresponding to a total of about 1200 data points ) .",
    "since we have introduced certain improvements in the data analysis procedure , this set partially overlaps with the previous data .",
    "a second reason for such an overlap is to provide now a fully systematic coverage of the phase space , presenting the data on a grid of kinematical variables ( two proton polar angles , their relative azimuthal angle and the arclength variable ) .",
    "we compare our experimental results to theoretical predictions based on various approaches .",
    "first , we use realistic @xmath1 potentials combined with phenomenological 3@xmath0 interactions . then",
    ", we base the predictions on a coupled - channel potential with the explicit single @xmath2-isobar degrees of freedom .",
    "finally , we use also the results of the calculations within the chpt framework at nnlo , with complete 2@xmath0 and 3@xmath0 dynamics .",
    "the comparison is supplemented by first global searches of possible regularities in differences between the data and theory , determined by inspecting the cross sections summed over certain kinematical variables .",
    "there are a few issues which need to be discussed in order to clarify the details of interpreting the experimental results .",
    "first of all , we already discussed that the 3@xmath0 interaction is still not completely understood .",
    "recent studies of strongly non - local interactions ( see  @xcite ) aim at total removal of the 3nf s .",
    "indeed , the non - locality is closely related to the 3nf s  @xcite and , in principle , this can result in an ambiguous separation of 3nf effects and off - shell effects . here",
    "we will not discuss this issue further .",
    "we only note that our predictions are based on several @xmath1 interactions , some of which are local , some are non - local .",
    "nevertheless , they all provide very similar predictions , alone and when combined with model 3nf s .",
    "we also note that the chiral interactions we use are evidently non - local .",
    "it should also be mentioned that all the applied formalisms miss two features which are inherently present in the experimental data .",
    "the first difference is the coulomb interaction : the experiment is performed in the deuteron - proton system while all calculations neglect any long - range forces like the coulomb interaction .",
    "it can be argued that the influence of the coulomb interaction at our energy is ( if any ) very small .",
    "calculations for the elastic scattering cross section at 65 mev  @xcite indicate an essentially negligible difference for @xmath23 and @xmath24 predictions , even in the cross - section minimum , the most sensitive region to study the 3nf effects .",
    "the simultaneous treatment of the coulomb and nuclear forces in the faddeev framework is progressing  @xcite , but predictions for our breakup data are not available yet .",
    "the first information suggest , however , that in contrast to the elastic scattering case , the coulomb effects can significantly influence the breakup cross sections in certain kinematical configurations .",
    "secondly , all the theoretical approaches are using a nonrelativistic framework and nonrelativistic kinematics . here again we expect the effects induced by relativity to be almost negligible . for cross sections of the breakup reaction in selected configurations",
    "it has been shown  @xcite using relativistic kinematics that the differences between both treatments are minimal at nucleon energies below 100 mev .",
    "the remaining problem of arclength differences does not introduce any noticeable effects either  we adopt a projection procedure  @xcite , transforming the theoretical predictions onto the relativistic kinematics .",
    "similar conclusions were also reached in  @xcite .",
    "ultimately rigorous comparison will be possible only after a full relativistic dynamics ( boosted potentials ) is implemented for the faddeev formalism , similarly to the first calculations for the 3@xmath0 bound states  @xcite and to the pioneering @xmath3 elastic scattering study  @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ secii ]",
    "we recall some details of the experiment and of the data analysis , emphasizing the refinement introduced since the previous report  @xcite .",
    "we briefly present in section  [ seciii ] the theoretical formalism underlying the calculations based on solving the faddeev equations with the realistic potentials , with the effective potential obtained in the chpt framework and the coupled - channel approach with the explicit @xmath2-isobar excitation treatment .",
    "our high precision breakup cross - section data are presented and compared to theoretical predictions in section  [ seciv ] .",
    "we conclude and summarize in section  [ secv ] .",
    "the experiment was performed at the kernfysisch versneller instituut ( kvi ) , groningen , the netherlands .",
    "only the main features of the experimental procedure are briefly summarized in the following , the detailed description can be found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the beam of vector and tensor polarized deuterons was focused to a spot of approximately 2 mm diameter on a liquid hydrogen target of few mm thickness .",
    "the salad ( small angle large acceptance detector )  @xcite detection system consisted of a three - plane multiwire proportional chamber ( mwpc ) and two layers of scintillator hodoscope ( cf .",
    "[ fig_setup ] ) .",
    "the mwpc was used for precise reconstruction of the charged - particle emission angles . to resolve reconstruction ambiguities for multihit events , the mwpc consisted of three active anode planes with wires spanned horizontally ( @xmath25 ) , vertically ( @xmath26 ) and diagonally ( @xmath27 ) .",
    "the almost point - like reaction region , as compared to the target - mwpc distance , allowed for reconstruction of the polar and azimuthal particle emission angles with the overall accuracy of 0.6@xmath28 .",
    "schematic view of the detection system , presenting the relative positions of the mwpc , the two layers of the scintillation detectors and the scattering chamber containing the target .",
    "the central beam line transporting the primary beam to the target and further downstream to a distant faraday cup is also indicated . for the sake of better view on the @xmath29-detector wall ,",
    "6 @xmath30 detectors ( one sector ) are removed from the figure.,width=325 ]    the plastic scintillator hodoscope covered the range of polar angles between 10@xmath28 and 35@xmath28 , and the full range of azimuthal angles .",
    "it consisted of 24 transmission detectors ( horizontal @xmath30 strips ) and 24 stopping detectors ( vertical @xmath29 slabs ) , forming together a two - dimensional array of 140 elements , with an area of about 60@xmath3160  mm@xmath32 each .",
    "the system possessed mirror symmetries with respect to the horizontal and vertical planes , i.e.  it could be viewed as composed of four similar sectors , each consisting of 6 slabs and 6 strips .",
    "strips belonging to one sector formed telescopes with slabs of the same sector , while they had no overlap with slabs in other sectors .",
    "this physical grouping of detectors had a reflection in the trigger logic , based on combination of hit multiplicities within the sectors .",
    "apart from trigger definition , information from the telescope array was used for particle identification and for determination of their energies .",
    "the events of interest can be roughly divided into three classes .",
    "first we distinguish single events , for which only one @xmath30@xmath29 telescope of the scintillation array has registered signals in a proper time window .",
    "the other two types are coincident events with two particles detected in two different telescopes . among them",
    "a distinction was made between coincidences of elements belonging to the diagonal sectors ( candidates for both , elastic scattering and breakup events ) and elements of the adjacent sectors or belonging to the same sector ( only breakup events ) .",
    "these three kinds of triggers were separately downscaled , enhancing the coincidence rates , to a level acceptable for the data acquisition system .",
    "fine classification of events has been done off - line by incorporating the mwpc information  for an extensive description see  @xcite .    for each registered event",
    "the information from the readout system comprised data from the scintillator hodoscope and from the mwpc .",
    "the hodoscope data included times measured with respect to the cyclotron reference ( rf ) signal and pulse heights for all active detectors ( strips and slabs ) .",
    "the mwpc information was coded into the numbers of the hit wires ( more precisely  centers and widths of the adjacent groups , i.e. clusters , of wires ) .",
    "in addition , several auxiliary pieces of information were stored with each event : the beam polarization state , trigger pattern at various electronic stages , etc .",
    "scalers , trigger rates , integrated beam current , pulse generator signals for dead - time monitoring , etc . , were read out every 1  s.      all basic steps of the data analysis procedure , like event selection , energy calibration , determination of detection efficiencies and cross section normalization , have been thoroughly described in  @xcite .",
    "the description below recalls the main features with an emphasis put on the introduced improvements and on additional studies performed with the aim to reduce experimental uncertainties or to control their magnitude with enhanced accuracy .",
    "the first step of the analysis was an adequate selection of the events of interest , i.e.  coincident proton - proton pairs from the breakup process or , necessary for cross section normalization , deuteron - proton coincidences originating from the elastic scattering . to guarantee that only the products of the reactions initiated within a single beam burst were selected , a 20-ns - wide time window was imposed on the time spectra .",
    "particle identification , based on the @xmath30@xmath29 technique , proved to be very reliable , providing very good separation between protons and deuterons in the whole energy range .",
    "energy calibration was performed on the basis of data collected in special calibration runs with energy degraders of precisely known thicknesses .",
    "the positions of the peaks corresponding to protons from elastic scattering which traversed the degraders were compared with the results of simulations taking into account all energy losses of protons on their paths from the reaction point to the detectors . in this way the relation between adc conversion ( pulse height ) and the energy deposited in the @xmath29 counter was found .",
    "the relation between the deposited energy and the proton energy at the moment of the reaction was obtained by analogous simulation of the proton energy losses . with all these provisions for each breakup event",
    "the initial energies of both protons ( @xmath33 and @xmath34 ) were determined .",
    "the coincidence ( kinematic ) spectra @xmath33 vs.  @xmath34 were built for each analyzed configuration , defined by polar angles @xmath35 , @xmath36 and relative azimuthal angle @xmath37 of the two emitted protons . the integration limits of @xmath38 and @xmath39 were used in all experimental integrations leading to the cross - section results , as well as in the studies concerning the performance of the detection system .",
    "the energies @xmath33 and @xmath34 of each event were transformed into two new variables : @xmath40 , denoting the distance of the @xmath41 point from the kinematical curve in the @xmath42 plane , and @xmath9  the value of the arclength along the kinematics .",
    "events in slices along the @xmath9 axis were projected on the central @xmath40 axis , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_e1e2 ] . in the resulting spectra ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig_e1e2 ] ) , the breakup events group themselves in a prominent peak , underlaid with only a low background of accidental coincidences .",
    "as it has been already pointed out in  @xcite , the choice of integration limits @xmath43 and @xmath44 , as well as of the assumed background function , is not critical since the contribution of accidental coincidences in all analyzed angular configurations was very low ( between 2% and 5% ) .",
    "however , to treat all configurations in a consistent way , and since all the @xmath40-projected distributions have approximately gaussian shape , the limits @xmath43 and @xmath44 were chosen at the values of @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the maximum of the fitted peak .",
    "a linear dependence of background between those points was assumed .",
    "gaussian shape and linear background fitted to a sample distribution are shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig_e1e2 ] .",
    "@xmath47 versus @xmath48 coincidence spectrum of the two protons registered at @xmath49 = 20@xmath50 , @xmath36 = 15@xmath50 and @xmath37 = 100@xmath51 .",
    "the solid line shows a 3-body kinematical curve calculated for the central values of the experimental angular ranges .",
    "inset : determination of the accidental coincidences .",
    "the spectrum was obtained by choosing one slice along the kinematical curve in the @xmath47 vs.  @xmath48 spectrum ( marked area in the main figure ) and projecting the events onto the @xmath40 axis .",
    "solid line represents the sum of a linear background function ( shown with the dashed line ) and a gaussian distribution , fitted in the range of @xmath40 between @xmath43 and @xmath44 , corresponding to distances of @xmath45 and @xmath46 from the peak position.,width=325 ]      the efficiency in determining the particle - emission angles , called for simplicity the mwpc efficiency , is a product of hardware efficiencies of the mwpc wire planes and the efficiency of our procedure of reconstructing the angles .",
    "since we accepted only events with vertical and horizontal wires properly correlated with the corresponding @xmath29 and @xmath30 detectors , the ranges of wire numbers associated with the individual hodoscope elements had to be set wide enough .",
    "these correlation tables were revised once again ( with respect to the procedure of ref .",
    "@xcite ) , inspecting the whole data sample and the ranges of wires associated with each hodoscope element have been slightly broadened . in this way , since there was practically no uncorrelated noise on the wires , no additional background was introduced while the efficiency was increased . with these new conditions",
    "the efficiency has been recalculated in the manner similar to the one described in  @xcite and , in addition , losses due to the requirement of correlation between all three planes have been determined . in spite of imposing this last restriction with reasonable `` safety limits '' of @xmath52 wires in @xmath27 plane , some protons scattered on their way to mwpc escaped those limits and were rejected , affecting the total efficiency .",
    "the final map of the mwpc efficiency is presented in fig .",

    "only the square - like area of the map is meaningful .",
    "the range of polar angle @xmath53 is from 0@xmath28 to 40@xmath28 with the binning of 1@xmath54 and the azimuthal angle @xmath55 covers the full range with the binning of 5@xmath54 .",
    "the discontinuities of lower efficiency regions are the result of this finite binning.,width=302 ]    thorough studies of the detection and trigger efficiencies were supplemented with additional tests , performed for configurations with the relative azimuthal angle of the two protons exceeding 90@xmath28 .",
    "such configurations can be realized by two mutually exclusive classes of events : when the two protons were registered in either the adjacent sectors or in two diagonal sectors of the hodoscope .",
    "these two cases corresponded to different trigger signals and different downscaling factors , therefore any relative inefficiency of the trigger logic and/or of the downscaling should be reflected by influencing the relative amount of events of the two groups .",
    "it should be stressed that we are sensitive only to the _ relative _ efficiency of the two trigger classes : since the events originating in the elastic scattering are always registered in diagonal sectors , the trigger / detection efficiency for the diagonal sectors cancels out in normalization , cf .",
    "( [ br_cs2 ] ) .",
    "each of the two event groups was analyzed separately and the ratio of their rates as a function of the arclength @xmath9 was constructed .",
    "an analogous ratio was calculated for simulated events .",
    "for all the configurations the experimental ratio is constant along @xmath9 and agrees with the result of simulations within statistical accuracy of 0.8% or less , depending on the configuration ( see example in fig .",
    "[ fig_effsec1 ] ) .",
    "the above result confirms not only the correct functioning of the trigger but also proper handling of the detection efficiencies in the analysis .",

    "points show the experimental values obtained within 4 mev @xmath9-bins .",
    "the difference between the purely geometrical factor ( dashed line ) and the total correction factor ( solid line ) including the acceptance losses for single - sector events , is clearly visible .",
    "numerical values of the factors are given with their statistical uncertainties.,width=325 ]    in configurations with the relative azimuthal angle of two protons @xmath37 not exceeding 90@xmath28 additional losses of acceptance have to be taken into account , due to cases when both protons were registered in the same @xmath30 or @xmath29 detector ( impossible proper particle identification and/or energy determination ) , or in two adjacent @xmath29 detectors . in the latter case",
    ", if at least one of the two protons was registered close to the edge of the two @xmath29 detectors , the event can not be distinguished from a so - called cross - over and had to be rejected ( cf .",
    "[ seciib3 ] ) .",
    "obviously , only single - sector events are affected by these effects .",
    "therefore , the total correction factor is obtained as a product of the ratio of events with both protons emitted into a single sector to all events collected in the specific configuration , and the actual correction , describing the losses within the single sector .",
    "experimentally , the total correction can be determined by the ratio of the breakup events _ registered _ in single sectors to all events of the considered configuration . by means of simulation",
    "one can investigate both contributions separately .",
    "first , in order to find for each configuration with @xmath61 purely geometrical factors of probability for single - sector events , an ideal case was assumed with no losses due to the detector granularity .",
    "then , the events were artificially digitized and analyzed in the same way as the experimental ones .",
    "it has been found that the acceptance losses reduce the geometrical factors by up to 13% , depending on the configuration , but they are constant as a function of @xmath9 for the selected geometry . in fig .",
    "[ fig_eff3 ] an example comparing the pure geometrical and the total correction factors is shown for one configuration .",
    "in general the losses increase with decreasing relative azimuthal angle and with the increasing difference of the polar angles .",
    "it should be noted that the errors introduced by applying the correction factors are much smaller than the factors themselves .",
    "the procedure of energy calibration faces a problem in determining the energy of particles which penetrate from one stopping detector to the adjacent one , in the so called cross - over events .",
    "simple summing up of the two deposited energies is not completely adequate due to energy losses in the foil covering all the detector walls .",
    "additionally , in a particular situation when the energy deposited in one of the @xmath29 slabs is below the detection threshold , the energy information is significantly distorted and , moreover , there is even no obvious signature of cross - over .",
    "such events are shifted away from the kinematic curve and contribute to the background attributed to accidental coincidences , which is then subtracted in the way described in section  [ seciib1 ] .",
    "therefore , a new approach was used , in which all cross - over candidates were rejected from the analysis ( in a way explained below ) and their amount was determined with the use of monte - carlo simulation based on the geant4 package .",

    "the simulations were performed for elastic scattering and for all studied configurations of the breakup reaction . for elastic scattering , due to rather high proton energy and constrained kinematics the effects are quite large  on average about 7% of all the events is biased with the cross - over possibility .",
    "the corresponding correction factors vary strongly , from 4% to 11% , depending on the proton polar angle @xmath62 .",

    "this is the only systematic uncertainty which changes along the arclength @xmath9 in every configuration ; all other contributions are rather configuration - specific .",
    "the uncertainty of the reconstructed value of the angle is due mainly to finite target thickness , finite size of the beam spot on the target , straggling effects and angular resolution related to the discreteness of the position information delivered by the mwpc .",

    "straggling effects in materials were introduced by means of geant4 transport routines and , finally , the positions of proton trajectories intersecting the wire planes were translated to hits on the wires .",
    "the same reconstruction algorithm as for the real data was applied to the simulated events . in this way we were able to compare the amount of events in each configuration defined by proton emission angles , with the number of events in the same configurations , but defined with the use of the reconstructed angles .",

    "practically the same amount of events emitted into the chosen range is reconstructed with the values of angles not belonging to the considered configuration , and therefore rejected . in this way",

    "there is , however , a number of configurations in which the cross - section data are not correctly reproduced by any calculation .",
    "the effect depends on the relative azimuthal angle @xmath37 of the two protons : for small values the data are overestimated by the predictions , the agreement becomes good in the central range of the analyzed @xmath37 and at the largest angles the discrepancy is reversed .",
    "thanks to the highly symmetric form of our detection system , which allows to reduce and to carefully control and test for systematic uncertainties , we basically exclude the possibility of attributing this inconsistency to any experimental deficiency .",
    "the regularities of disagreements have been studied in more detail using a global analysis , in which we have concentrated on both , the shapes of the distributions as well as on the absolute values of the cross sections .",
    "it has been established that for configurations with large values of the @xmath37 angle the agreement between the experimental data and the theoretical predictions is improved when the 3nf contributions are taken into account .",
    "on the contrary , for @xmath61 the 3nf effects move the predictions away from the data .",
    "this conclusion is valid for all combinations of realistic @xmath1 potentials with the model 3nf s .",
    "it also holds for the predictions obtained in the coupled - channel approach , but with reduced size of the effects induced by the @xmath2-excitation .",
    "the chpt calculations predict essentially no sensitivity to the 3nf influences along @xmath37 .",
    "we have confirmed that sizable influences of 3nf s are visible in the breakup cross sections at the energy of our measurement .",
    "comparison of the agreement between the experimental data and the predicted cross - section values is presented by first examples of analyzing a multi - dimensional breakup data set by inspecting its projections onto selected sub - spaces of lower dimensions .",
    "since the advantages of the experimental method reduce strongly the impact of systematic errors , the established discrepancies might be considered as signal of some missing ingredients in the assumed dynamics of the 3@xmath0 system . determining regularities in the disagreements might eventually help to identify shortcomings of the nuclear force models .",
    "however , it can not be ruled out that the discrepancies result from coulomb effects , which are ignored in all theoretical approaches presently used . in view of the recent advances in including long range forces into the faddeev formalism this persisting question",
    "might soon be quantitatively addressed .",
    "our present study clearly shows the importance of complete , precise experiments , determining various observables of the breakup reaction . implementing symmetric detection systems covering large fractions of the phase space allows to attain rich data sets , for which systematic uncertainties are strongly suppressed and well controlled .",
    "results of such experiments are the basis for systematic comparisons with different theoretical approaches .",
    "they provide stringent criteria for verification of the models of the nuclear hamiltonian , assumed in formulating the three - nucleon scattering problem .",
    "further improvements of the theoretical models , which are also a basis for exact calculations in many - body systems , require still more experimental input .",
    "we are going to supplement the cross - section results with polarization observables , with which we will be able to provide more detailed information , and hopefully pin down the discrepancies found here .",
    "more data sets are needed , acquired at energies lower and higher than in our study , with proton and deuteron beams , as well as covering still larger fractions of the phase space .",
