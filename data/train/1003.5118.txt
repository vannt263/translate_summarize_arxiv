    "the determination of the angular momentum of the cores and the fraction of their energy stored in rotational motions is complicated by the fact that the velocity fields in the cores usually exhibit complex supersonic motions when mapped with tracers such as co , cs , and c@xmath17o with a transition to subsonic , coherent motions when tracers with a higher excitation density are used such as nh@xmath1 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 lines ( e.g. barranco & goodman 1998 ; goodman et al .",

    "our results also show that the cfe is strongly reduced with an increasingly important magnetic field in the cloud , particularly for the case of the higher density cores .",
    "it is useful to emphasize any comparisons between isothermal models such as ours and the observations remain valid as long as we are dealing with pre - stellar cores which are themselves embedded in a cloud that does not harbor strong sources of radiation ( stars / protostars ) .",
    "the presence of radiation will unavoidably alter the structure of the cloud and reduce the core formation efficiency , and subsequently the star formation efficiency as recently pointed out by the simulations of bate ( 2009 ) and offner et al .",
    "after having defined the cells that belong to the same core , we calculate the components of the angular momentum of the core , @xmath97 around the center of mass using the standard expression :    @xmath98    where @xmath99 is the distance from each cell to the center of mass , @xmath100 the mass of the cell , and @xmath101 is the relative velocity of the cell with respect to the core s center of mass .",
    "the specific angular momentum is then calculated as being :    @xmath102    where @xmath103 is the mass of the core .",

    "however , as @xmath33 is intended to represent a volume integrated estimate of the balance between centrifugal forces and effective gravitational forces taking into account that dense cores in molecular clouds are not isolated objects , and in order not to make any assumption on the values of @xmath112 in the 3d estimate , it is more adequate , from a theoretical point of view , to replace @xmath105 by the quantity @xmath113 which is slightly different than @xmath105 ( e.g. , dib et al .",
    "2007a ) and which is given by :    @xmath114    where @xmath115 is the gravitational potential .",
    "note that @xmath113 is not exactly equal to the volume gravitational energy , @xmath105 , because the true gravitational potential is a result of the distribution of matter inside the core and outside of it ( e.g. , the parent cloud ) .",
    "however , as already shown in dib et al .",
    "( 2007a ) , the essential part of the gravitational acceleration in the core is due to the mass contained inside the core and in general @xmath116 .",
    "thus , our definition of @xmath33 is :    @xmath117    it is important to stress that in a time dependent model of a turbulent cloud with gravity , the statistical properties of the cores formed in the cloud may vary with time ( e.g. , jappsen & klessen 2004 ; dib et al .",
    "in addition to angular momentum loss that may be due to the cores secular evolution ( i.e. , magnetic braking ) , the angular momentum of a core might be modified if the core enters a soft gravitational encounter with another / other core(s ) and/or a physical merger ( e.g. , larson 2010 ) . following a collision",

    "[ fig1 ] shows that the number of cores detected at the lowest thresholds declines as a function of time while the number of cores identified at the highest thresholds increases . as some of the cores evolve into a stage of gravitational contraction ,",

    "a similar trend is observed in the @xmath33 distributions in fig .",

    ", we will therefore focus our attention on the discrepancy between the observed and numerically measured specific angular momentum distributions .",
    "offner et al . (",

    "they found that the 2d cores have specific angular momenta values that are systematically larger by a factor of @xmath14 than the values of @xmath13 for the 3d cores .",

    ", we used an initial @xmath132 ma number of @xmath39 and which decays to @xmath133 by @xmath69 whereas the observed cores by goodman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and caselli et al ( 2002a ) are sampled from different molecular cloud complexes in which the dynamical conditions ( e.g. , the mach number ) are different .",
    "the most simple situation is that the parameters governing the dynamical evolution of the molecular cloud in the models do not exactly match the dynamical conditions in the regions where the observed cores are formed and thus cores in the observations may have intrinsically more specific angular momentum than the simulated ones .",
    "the second effect may be related to the fact that the simulated cores are identified in intrinsic space whereas the observed cores are identified in position - position - velocity cubes .",
    "although some differences in the cores populations may arise when using the two methods , most of the most massive cores will be detected in the ppv method with their masses modified by a correction factor of order unity ( e.g. , smith et al .",
    "it is therefore unlikely that a factor of @xmath14 difference can originate from variations from the clump finding algorithm .",
    "a third possibility is that the totally different ways of calculating the specific angular momentum in the observations and in the simulations may stand behind this discrepancy . in order to test the latter hypothesis ,",
    "it is necessary to generate synthetic velocity maps of the cores using individual projections , such as to eliminate any potential effect of blending of the cores along the line of sight , and measure the specific angular momentum from the projected velocity maps following the standard observational procedure . unlike previous simulations , our models which have a high spatial resolution , and a large number of cores allow us to compare the entire distributions of the intrinsically measured specific angular momentum distributions to the ones derived from synthetic observations of the cores .",
    "we generate synthetic velocity maps of the c160 cores in both simulations at a nearly similar epoch ( i.e. , at @xmath82 myrs @xmath83 for simulation b1 and @xmath84 myrs @xmath85 for simulation b2 ) along the three main directions of the box .",
    "as stated above , the cores are projected individually such as to eliminate any effect of blending along the line of sight .",
    "the velocity in each pixel of the cores is the mean velocity in the line of sight .",
    "the velocity maps corresponding to the cores shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , respectively .",
    "the velocity maps exhibit a variety of features ranging from well ordered motions that can be assimilated to rotation , both for roundish and filamentary cores , to more complex dynamical configurations in which there is no clearly verifiable velocity gradient .",
    "in general , the velocity maps of the cores , especially when the same cores are seen along the three different projections , do not support the idea of simple rigid - body rotation .",
    "it is interesting to note that recent high spatial and spectral resolution observations using the plateau de bures interferometer by csengeri et al .",
    "( 2010 ) of five massive dense cores in cygnus - x show a variety and level of complexity in their dynamical features similar to the ones observed in our synthetic velocity maps .    in order to derive the velocity gradient from the synthetic velocity maps , we employ the program vfit , developed by goodman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , which calculates the global velocity gradient in the map , @xmath134 and its orientation . the uncertainty in the centroid velocity needed as an input by vfit is taken to be the velocity dispersion of the velocity distribution along the line of sight .",
    "the direction of the velocity gradient for the velocity maps in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] is shown by the line enclosed in the circle in the lowest left corner of each map .",
    "the projected specific angular momentum is given by @xmath135 , where @xmath136 and @xmath103 are the estimated projected angular momentum , and mass of the core , respectively . by making the assumption of uniform rotation , as is commonly done in the observations ,",
    "one can write that @xmath137 , where @xmath138 is the moment of inertia of the core , @xmath139 the value of the projected radius of the core taken to be the square root of its projected surface , and @xmath140 is a factor of order unity which depends on the morphology and radial density profile of the core . the angular velocity of the core is then estimated as being @xmath141 , where @xmath142 is the inclination of the rotation axis to the line of sight .",
    "thus @xmath9 is given by :    @xmath143    an assumption about the inclination of the cores and the value of @xmath144 has to be made .",

    "[ fig11 ] is @xmath157 and the median value of the c160 cores in simulation b2 is @xmath158 .",

    "[ fig11 ] is to show that the observed shift between the observed and numerically derived distributions of the specific angular momentum as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is most likely caused by the calculation method of the specific angular momentum using the global gradient method under the assumption of uniform rotation of the cores .",
    "we thus conclude , based on fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] that the observational determinations of the specific angular momentum tend to overestimate the true value of the specific angular momentum by a factor of at least @xmath160 but most likely produces an overestimate of @xmath13 by a factor of @xmath161 .",
    "the origin of the 2d-3d discrepancy stems from the fact that the observational method is based on the global gradient method assuming uniform rotation , whereas the measurement of the angular momentum in the intrinsic space is a summation running over all parcels of gas in the cores with their more complex dynamical behavior .",
    "a simplified method in theoretical works of assessing the specific angular momentum of cores is through the use of a size - specific angular momentum relation ( @xmath162 ) . if motions in the cores that are assimilated to rotational motions are purely due to turbulent motions following a larson - like velocity dispersion - size relation of the form @xmath163 , then , the angular velocity @xmath164 will be given by @xmath165 and the specific angular momentum by @xmath166 . for @xmath167",
    "as observed initially by larson ( 1981 ) , the expected dependence of @xmath8 is @xmath168 . on the other extreme hand , a rigid - body rotation ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath18 is constant ) implies that @xmath169 .",
    "such relations have been derived observationally by several groups ( e.g. , goldsmith & arquilla 1985 ; goodman et al .",
    "1993 ; phillips 1999 ) .",
    "bodenheimer ( 1995 ) combined the data of goldsmith & arquilla ( 1985 ) and goodman et al .",
    "( 1993 ) and found that the exponent of the size - specific angular momentum relation is of the order of @xmath170 .",
    "phillips ( 1999 ) compiled a large number of published molecular cloud data and their substructure of clumps and cores and found @xmath171 to be of the order @xmath172 and close to @xmath173 for flattened systems .",
    "[ fig12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] display , at a few selected epochs , the intrinsic specific angular momenta @xmath8 of the cores as a function of their characteristic size @xmath26 for c20 cores ( top ) and c160 cores ( bottom ) in simulations b1 and b2 , respectively .",
    "we perform a robust least absolute deviation fit to the data displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] in addition to the same data at the additional epochs we analyze in order to derive the exponent and normalization of the relation @xmath174 .",
    "[ fig14 ] displays the time evolution of @xmath171 and @xmath175 for the two populations of cores in the two simulations .",
    "both @xmath171 and @xmath175 are observed to decrease as a function of time and most importantly so for the c160 cores .",
    "the value of @xmath171 is observed to decrease from around @xmath176 down to @xmath16 on a timescale of the order of @xmath177 .",
    "this decrease in the specific angular momentum indicates a loss of the momentum as the cores evolve and become , on average , more gravitationally bound .",
    "following our earlier approach of generating observational counterparts to the relations studied in the intrinsic three - dimensional space , we construct the same @xmath178 relation of the cores , where @xmath179 is the size of the core seen in projection and taken to be the square root of its surface and @xmath9 is the same , earlier defined , specific angular momentum derived from the velocity maps of the cores .",
    "[ fig15 ] displays the @xmath178 relation for the c160 cores at nearly similar epochs in the two simulations b1(left ) and b2 ( right ) .",
    "in addition to the higher normalization discussed in the previous section , the slopes of the @xmath180 relation are found to be shallower than the corresponding @xmath181 relations observed for the same cores at the same epochs . whereas the exponent @xmath171 of the @xmath181 is found to be equal to @xmath182 and @xmath183 at these epochs in simulations b1 and b2 respectively , the exponent of the @xmath180 relation , derived from a robust least absolute deviation fit to the data in fig  [ fig15 ] , are @xmath184 and @xmath185 ( these values are @xmath186 and @xmath187 , respectively when derived a minimization of the chi - square error statistic method ) .",
    "this shows that the observational bias in the overestimate of the specific angular moment discussed in",
    "  [ distrib ] affects in a more significant way the smallest cores and this results in a value of @xmath188 smaller than @xmath189 .",
    "finally , these results suggest that if a simple estimate of the specific angular momentum is to be made using a size - specific angular momentum relation , a value of @xmath183 should be used for the exponent of this relation rather than the smaller values derived in the observations .",
    "the derived values of @xmath171 in the three - dimensional space which yields values of @xmath190 should nevertheless not be interpreted as the cores being in a state of rigid body - rotation as this is not supported by the observations of their projected velocity maps .",
    "in this paper , we have analyzed the rotational properties of dense molecular cloud cores formed in two magnetized , self - gravitating molecular cloud simulations with a decaying turbulence .",
    "the two simulations differ by the strength of the magnetic field in the clouds with one cloud being mildly magnetically supercritical and the other being strongly magnetically supercritical .",
    "our results show that the formation efficiency of dense cores is strongly reduced with increasing importance of the magnetic field in the cloud ( going down from 33 percent per free - fall time in the strongly supercritical cloud to 6 percent for the mildly supercritical cloud ) .",
    "we also observe that the median value of the specific angular momentum of the high density cores in the mildly supercritical simulation is smaller than the values derived for cores in the strongly supercritical simulation .",
    "this result is consistent with the fact that magnetic braking which leads to angular momentum loss is playing a more important role in the cloud where the magnetic field is stronger .",
    "we have focused our attention on the discrepancies that may arise between estimates of the specific angular momentum of the cores derived from the global velocity gradient method commonly used in the observations and its the true value measured in the intrinsic three - dimensional space . in order to derive the specific angular momentum of the cores following the observational procedure , we generate synthetic velocity maps of the cores along three different projections .",
    "the global velocity gradient of the cores is measured from the velocity map using the vfit routine employed initially by goodman et al .",
    "the specific angular momentum is then calculated using the global velocity gradient value under the assumption of uniform rotation of the cores .",
    "we find , in the two simulations , that the distributions of the ratio of the specific angular momentum determined in the intrinsic 3d space to the one derived from projected velocity maps peaks at values around @xmath12 .",
    "this may well explain the difference by a factor @xmath14 that is observed between the distribution of specific angular momentum derived from the intrinsic data in our simulations and the corresponding real observations using the nh@xmath1 and n@xmath3h@xmath4 molecules of roughly similar excitation density than the density thresholds used to identify the cores in the simulations .",
    "we suggest that the origin of this discrepency ( between 2d and 3d ) lies in the fact that contrary to the intrinsic determination of @xmath13 which sums up the individual gas parcels contributions to the angular momentum , the observational determination of @xmath13 is based on a measurement on the global velocity gradient under the hypothesis of uniform rotation which smoothes out the complex fluctuations present in the three - dimensional velocity field .",
    "we therefore suggest that previous measurements of the specific angular momentum of the cores overestimate its true value and that a correction factor of @xmath14 should be applied to these measurements as well as to new determinations of the specific angular momentum when using the global gradient method adopted so far in the observations . as already stressed by other groups ( e.g. , padoan et al .",

    "<S> in this work , we present a detailed study of the rotational properties of magnetized and self - gravitating dense molecular cloud cores formed in a set of two very high resolution three - dimensional molecular cloud simulations with decaying turbulence . </S>",
    "<S> the simulations have been performed using the adaptative mesh refinement code ramses with an effective resolution of 4096@xmath0 grid cells . </S>",
    "<S> one simulation represents a mildly magnetically - supercritical cloud and the other a strongly magnetically - supercritical cloud . </S>",
    "<S> we identify dense cores at a number of selected epochs in the simulations at two density thresholds which roughly mimick the excitation densities of the nh@xmath1 ( @xmath2)=(1,1 ) transition and the n@xmath3h@xmath4 ( 1 - 0 ) emission line . a noticeable global difference between the two simulations </S>",
    "<S> is the core formation efficiency ( cfe ) of the high density cores . in the strongly supercritical simulations the cfe is @xmath5 percent per unit free - fall time of the cloud ( @xmath6 ) , whereas in the mildly supercritical simulations this value goes down to @xmath7 percent per unit @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the intrinsic specific angular momentum ( @xmath8 ) distributions of the cores with the specific angular momentum derived using synthetic two - dimensional velocity maps of the cores ( @xmath9 ) , shows that the synthetic observations tend to overestimate the true value of the specific angular momentum by a factor of @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the distribution of the ratio @xmath11 of the cores peaks at around @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the origin of this discrepancy lies in the fact that contrary to the intrinsic determination of @xmath13 which sums up the individual gas parcels contributions to the angular momentum , the determination of the specific angular momentum using the standard observational procedure which is based on a measurement on the global velocity gradient under the hypothesis of uniform rotation smoothes out the complex fluctuations present in the three - dimensional velocity field . </S>",
    "<S> our results may well provide a natural explanation for the discrepancy by a factor @xmath14 observed between the intrinsic three - dimensional distributions of the specific angular momentum and the corresponding distributions derived in real observations . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that previous and future measurements of the specific angular momentum of dense cores which are based on the measurement of the observed global velocity gradients may need to be reduced by a factor of @xmath14 in order to derive a more accurate estimate of the true specific angular momentum in the cores . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that the exponent of the size - specific angular momentum relation are smaller ( @xmath15 ) in the synthetic observations than their values derived in the three - dimensional space ( @xmath16 ) . </S>"
