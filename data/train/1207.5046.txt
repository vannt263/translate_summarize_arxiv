    "in quantum field theory , the boundary conditions imposed on the field operator give rise to a number of interesting physical effects . in the first class of models , these conditions are due to presence of boundaries having different physical nature , like macroscopic bodies in qed , extended topological defects , horizons and so on . in this type of problems",
    "the field operator obeys the boundary condition on some space - like surfaces .",
    "a well - known quantum effect induced by this kind of boundary conditions is the casimir effect ( for reviews see ref .",
    "the casimir effect is among the most striking macroscopic manifestations of nontrivial properties of the quantum vacuum .",
    "the boundary conditions imposed on the field operator alter the zero - point modes of a quantized field and shift the vacuum expectation values ( vevs ) of quantities , such as the energy density and stresses .",
    "this leads to the appearance of forces acting on constraining boundaries .    in the second class of models ,",
    "the boundary conditions arise due to the nontrivial topology of the space .",

    "the topological casimir effect has been used for the stabilization of moduli fields and as a source for dynamical compactification of extra dimensions . as it has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the casimir energy related to the compact subspace of extra dimensions can serve as a model for dark energy driving the accelerated expansion of the universe at the present epoch .",
    "note that , the recent measurements of the casimir forces between macroscopic bodies provide a sensitive test to constrain the parameters of various types of long - range interactions predicted by unification theories @xcite .",

    "although the corresponding operator is local , due to the global nature of the vacuum , this quantity carries an important information about the topology of the background space .",
