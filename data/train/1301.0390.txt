    "supernova explosions following the gravitational collapse of a massive star ( @xmath1 ) are among the most fascinating events in the universe as they radiate as much energy as the sun is expected to emit over its whole life span @xcite .",
    "nuclear physics is an essential ingredient in the numerical simulations which aim to describe these events , since realistic astrophysical descriptions of the collapse and post - bounce evolution rely on the accuracy of the implementation of weak processes and equation(s ) of state ( eos ) @xcite .",
    "determining the eos constitutes a particularly difficult task since phenomenology ranges from a quasi - ideal un - homogeneous gas to strongly interacting uniform matter and , potentially , deconfined quark - matter .",
    "the situation is even more difficult if phase transitions are experienced , since mean - field models fail in such situations @xcite .    the coulomb - quenched liquid - gas ( lg ) phase transition taking place at densities smaller than the nuclear saturation density ( @xmath2 @xmath3 ) is , probably , the most notorious and best understood case @xcite . at highest densities",
    ", a quark - gluon plasma is expected , but predictions on the exact location of the transition are strongly model dependent @xcite . in the intermediate density domain",
    "simple energetic considerations show that additional degrees of freedom may be available , such as hyperons , nuclear resonances , mesons or muons @xcite .",

    "the possibility of a first order phase transition to hyperonic matter in effective rmf models has been discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , too . within the latter models , the phase transition region",
    "is located at sub - saturation densities , and is thus not relevant for star matter . using a simple two - component @xmath4 model ,",
    "we have recently studied the complete phase diagram of strange baryonic matter showing that it exhibits a complex structure with first and second order phase transitions @xcite . however , the exploratory calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite neglects the fact that in addition to baryon number @xmath5 and strangeness @xmath6 , the charge @xmath7 and lepton @xmath8 quantum numbers are also populated .",
    "the thermodynamics of the complete system should thus be studied in the four - dimensional space of the associated charges @xmath9 .",
    "the strict electroneutrality constraint @xmath10 , necessary to obtain a thermodynamic limit @xcite , makes the physical space three - dimensional .",
    "as it is known from the eos studies at sub - saturation density @xcite , the introduction of the charge degree of freedom can have a very strong influence on the phase diagram and can not be neglected .",
    "in this work we therefore introduce a four - component model constituted of neutrons , protons , electrons and @xmath0-hyperons .",

    "the form of the interaction is the same as in the widely used lattimer - swesty @xcite eos .",
    "let us mention that the observation of a neutron star ( psr j 1614 - 2230 ) with a mass of almost two solar masses  @xcite imposes stringent constraints on the hyperonic interaction in dense neutron star matter .",
    "the maximum mass for a @xmath30 system as studied in the present manuscript is @xmath31 with the parameter set bg i for the coupling constants ( see table  [ table : bg1 ] ) in agreement with the mass of psr j 1614 - 2230 .",
    "including all hyperonic degrees of freedom , the maximum neutron star mass obtained with parametrisation bg i decreases and becomes slightly too low .",

    ". then a maxwell equal - area construction on this function allows defining two values @xmath51 , @xmath52 , which are characterized by the complete gibbs equilibrium conditions @xmath53 for a multi - component system .",
    "the hyper - surface connecting the two points @xmath54,@xmath55 is the usual gibbs construction .",
    "this procedure is independent of the choice of the densities ( here : @xmath56 ) to be legendre - transformed , provided the order parameter has a non - vanishing component along the remaining density ( here : @xmath48 ) .",
    "if this was not the case , that is if there was no jump in @xmath48 at the phase transition , @xmath57 , the information on the phase transition could not be extracted from the hybrid ensemble eq.([hybrid ] ) .",
    "we have verified that this is never the case , and the phase transition we will identify always separates a more diluted ( lower @xmath48 ) from a denser ( higher @xmath48 ) phase .",
    "for a generic physical multi - component system , this is not always the case and in the general case the convexity properties of the free energy have to be examined with care in order to identify phase transitions in such systems . in particular for our specific physics application of strangeness phase transition",
    ", we will explicitly show that the charge density is almost unaffected by the phase transition .",
    "this means that the concavity of the free energy @xmath58 as a function of @xmath59 is extremely small .",

    "two phase - coexistence domains may be identified .",
    "the one lying along @xmath64 at sub - saturation density corresponds to the well known lg like phase transition taking place in dilute nuclear matter @xcite .",
    "the second domain lies at supra - saturation densities ( @xmath65 ) , and the direction of phase separation is dominated by the strange density . in the density range shown by the figure ,",
    "this domain is not upper limited in @xmath66 . we observe a bending at very high density meaning that the domain is finite as for the sub - saturation lg transition , but since we do not consider these densities as being realistically described within the present model , we refrain from showing the whole domain here .",
    "this transition is consistent with our previous findings within a simpler 2d model @xcite , though it obviously depends on the assumed strengths of the @xmath67 and @xmath68-interactions .",
    "it is at first sight surprising to observe that the coexistence border of the latter transition is given by simple straight lines . in principle",
    "the coexistence borders of a first order phase transition with three conserved charges are given by two surfaces in the three dimensional space .",
    "for their projection on the @xmath43 plane to be given by a one - dimensional curve , these surfaces have to be perpendicular to that plane , that is independent of @xmath59 . the observed independence on the electric charge shows that the strange charge is the dominant order parameter for this transition .",
    "however , we can expect that some dependence on the electric charge would arise if charged strange particles were included , because of the correlation which would then exist between @xmath59 and @xmath69 . the middle part of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the projection of the phase coexistence domains in the @xmath70 plane for @xmath63 , corresponding to the strangeness - equilibrium condition which is relevant for star matter . as discussed above , the coexistence domain being three - dimensional this representation depends on the value of the third variable given by @xmath71 ( or @xmath69 ) .",
    "the well - known isospin dependence of the lg phase transition occurring at @xmath64 @xcite is apparent .",
    "we have just noticed that the order parameter of the strangeness phase transition is given by a combination of the strange and baryonic density . not surprisingly , the direction of phase separation of this transition in the @xmath70 plane is thus dominated by the baryonic density . the order parameter component in the direction of the electric charge",
    "can be understood as due to the correlation between the different densities .",
    "we are facing a transition between a relatively diluted , non - strange phase to a relatively dense , more strange one .",
    "since @xmath0 s are neutral , the positively charged component of the baryonic density is relatively less important in the dense phase , which explains the slope of the separation direction .",

    "[ fig : phd_npl_mu ] offers the complementary image on how the two phase coexistence domains look like when plotted with respect to @xmath74 . in this case the condition @xmath63 is released and alternative arbitrary constraints on @xmath75 mev are imposed .",

    "mathematically , this means that any @xmath76 is possible .",
    "this makes @xmath71 span a semi - infinite domain lower limited by @xmath77 . reminding that - in @xmath78 coordinates - the nuclear matter lg phase coexistence is figured by a curve whose extremities are the critical points",
    ", it is easy to understand that , by fixing @xmath79 , one fixes both @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "now , one can straightforwardly identify the semi - infinite horizontal coexisting lines as the ones corresponding to lg .",
    "the strangeness - driven phase coexistence at fixed @xmath79 appears in @xmath74 as two merged semi - infinite linear segments .",
    "the merging point corresponds to the state where the equilibrium counter - part of the dense phase jumps from vacuum ( low @xmath71 ) to a dilute mixture ( high @xmath71 ) .",

    "]    electrons are coupled to charged baryons through the electromagnetic interaction , which can modify the baryonic phase diagram .",
    "however , the charge neutrality condition @xmath10 makes the associated chemical potential @xmath79 ill - defined and keeps the problem three - dimensional  @xcite . since in homogeneous matter with the condition @xmath82 the coulomb interaction exactly vanishes @xcite ,",
    "the total mean field pressure can be written as a sum over independent terms @xmath83 .",
    "we shall still concentrate on the @xmath84 contribution , as the other terms do not affect the convexity properties of the thermodynamical potential on which phase transitions rely .",
    "we have constructed the full phase diagram of the @xmath85 system in the @xmath86 space using the hybrid ensemble @xmath87 in practice , the charge neutrality condition gives @xmath88 , which allows to infer the electron chemical potential , @xmath89 , via @xmath90 , \\label{eq : mue_ne}\\ ] ] and to obtain @xmath91 .",

    "in particular , in a cold neutron star in @xmath94-equilibrium we would have @xmath95 fixing @xmath96 . in core collapse events , on the other hand ,",
    "neutrinos can not be considered in equilibrium in the major part of the system . here",
    "we want to study the entire phase diagram , not restricting to @xmath94-equilibrium , and we therefore leave @xmath93 free .",
    "neutrinos , even in equilibrium , would not change the phase properties , and are thus neglected for the sake of simplicity in the present discussion .",

    "@xcite , a strong coulomb quenching of the lg - phase transition is obtained .",
    "however , the coexistence domain of the strangeness - driven phase transition is practically un - modified .",
    "this can be easily understood from the fact that the effect of the neutrality condition @xmath82 on the two phase transitions is very different .",
    "the phase transition at sub - saturation density has the total baryonic density as order parameter . at such densities",
    ", @xmath48 is strongly correlated to @xmath97 because of the nuclear symmetry energy which favorizes symmetric @xmath98 matter .",
    "the phase transition thus implies a discontinuity in @xmath88 , which is strongly disfavored by the huge electron incompressibility @xcite . at supersaturation densities",
    "the order parameter is given by @xmath69 which is very loosely correlated to @xmath59 .",
    "the phase transition thus does not imply any strong change in the electron distribution and the presence of electrons thus does not influence much the phase diagram .",
    "the temperature dependence of the phase diagram along @xmath63 is presented in fig .",
    "we can observe that the direction of phase separation is almost independent of @xmath99 .",
    "more interesting , starting from a finite value of @xmath99 , a critical point appears and survives up to very high temperature . on fig .",
    "[ fig2bis ] the critical temperature and the electron fraction @xmath100 are shown as a function of baryon density .",
    "these values are typically reached within the cooling proto - neutron star , meaning that effects of criticality should be experienced .",
    "the cooling of proto - neutron stars is mostly driven by neutrino diffusion during the first seconds . to explore the consequence of criticality for the cooling of proto - neutron star",
    ", we therefore turn to calculate the mean free path for the neutrino scattering off n , p , and @xmath0 particles including the long - range correlations , essential for the study of criticality , in the linear response approximation . in the non - relativistic limit for the baryonic components , the mean free path at temperature @xmath99 of a neutrino with initial energy @xmath101",

    "the effect of the rpa correlations around the critical point is almost independent of the neutrino energy in agreement with the interpretation as critical opalescence .",
    "to conclude , we have studied the phase diagram of a mixture constituted of interacting neutrons , protons and @xmath0-hyperons under the condition of strangeness - equilibrium , relevant for supernovae and neutron star physics . at supra - saturation densities ,",
    "a strangeness - driven phase transition can take place , depending on the assumed strengths of nucleon-@xmath0 and @xmath0-@xmath0 interactions @xcite .",

    "see @xcite .",
    "in addition to the eos , linear response theory shows that the neutrino mean - free path dramatically decreases close to the critical point of this phase transition , which occurs in a thermodynamic domain accessible to newly - born proto - neutron stars .",
