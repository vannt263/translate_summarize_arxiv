    "hierarchical structure formation models predict that galaxies and their central supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) form and grow via merging events . these events may increase activity of the central smbhs and/or star formation in the host galaxies .",
    "simulations suggest that simultaneous activity of the black holes may be expected at kpc - scale separations ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* van wassenhove et al . , 2012 ) ) . additionally , according to ( * ? ? ?",
    "* steinborn et al . ( 2015 ) ) and @xcite , the number of luminous dual agn increases with decreasing separation of the supermassive black holes .",
    "directly resolving the tightest agn pairs is only feasible in the most nearby universe with the current optical and x - ray instrumentation , while cosmological simulations of @xcite show that less dual agn are expected at low redshift .    at radio wavelengths ,",
    "the technique of very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) provides the highest achievable angular resolution , however only @xmath2% of agn are radio - loud .",
    "since a large fraction of low - luminosity agn are very compact on milliarcsecond resolution ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* panessa & giroletti , 2013 ) ) , vlbi is a powerful tool to confirm such agn candidates .",
    "but low - luminosity agn may have very resolved structures on parsec scales as well ( e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* nagar et al . , 2002 ) ) , which can only be imaged by arrays with shorter baselines .",
    "also vlbi instruments are not ideal for large surveys due to their limited field of view .",
    "therefore , it is essential to assemble reliable samples of candidate dual agn .",
    "currently , however , no method is known which can be used to select such sources .",
    "searching for double - peaked narrow optical emission lines emerging from the two separate narrow - line regions ( nlr ) of dual agn was proposed as such a method ( e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* wang et al . , 2009 ) ) . however , the double - peaked spectral lines can also arise due to other effects occurring in a single agn , e.g. peculiar kinematics or jet  cloud interactions ( ( * ? ? ? * heckman et al . , 1984 ) ) , a rotating , disk - like nlr ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* xu & komossa , 2009 ) ) , and the combination of a blobby nlr and extinction effects ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* crenshaw et al . , 2010 ) ) .",
    "therefore it is important to follow - up those radio - emitting sources claimed to be promising dual agn candidates using vlbi technique .",

    "compared with the 1.7-ghz evn data , both detected components ( c and s ) show larger flux densities in the e - merlin observation .",
    "this can indicate that at this frequency , e - merlin picked up the large - scale structure resolved out in the evn observation and/or it may be caused by flux density variability .",
    "however , the large fwhm size of component s ( @xmath23mas ) indicates that the resolution effect is more likely in that case . at @xmath1ghz ,",
    "the flux densities of the only detected component ( component c ) agree within the uncertainties in the e - merlin and evn observations .",
    "components n and s have significantly larger fwhm sizes ( @xmath23mas , and @xmath24mas , respectively ) in the e - merlin data than component c ( @xmath25mas ) .",
    "this suggests that component c is a compact core , while components n and s are more extended features probably associated with the jet or lobe of the agn . on the other hand , the detection of emission at the position of component s with the evn shows that it contains a compact radio - emitting feature .",
    "there are two scenarios that can explain the radio structure of j1425 + 3231 .",
    "( i ) there is a single low - power radio - emitting nucleus in the source at the position of component c , the synchrotron - emitting jet base . a jet - like feature ( component n ) to the north , and a lobe ( component s ) to the south",
    "could be imaged with e - merlin at @xmath0ghz .",
    "the latter contains a compact hotspot , which was detected with the evn .",
    "however , component n was resolved out with evn completely . in this scenario ,",
    "the double - peaked optical emission lines are related to the jet - driven outflows and not to dual agn .",
    "a similar observational character has been found in other radio agn with double - peaked narrow optical lines ( e.g. 3c316 an et al . , 2013 ) .",
    "( ii ) there are two low - power radio emitting nuclei in the source at the position of components c and s. their compact cores were detected in the evn observation at @xmath5ghz .",
    "one of them ( c ) has a jet - like extension to the north ( n ) .",
    "the large - scale structure of the secondary nucleus ( s ) was detected with e - merlin .",
    "the second option is less likely since s was not detected at any of the higher - frequency radio observations , indicating a very steep radio spectrum ( @xmath26 , the spectral index is defined as @xmath27 ) , which is at odds with its identification as an agn core .",
    "j1425 + 3231 was proposed to be a dual agn candidate because of its double - peaked optical spectrum ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* peng et al . , 2011 ) ) .",
    "high - resolution radio observations with the evn showed that it has two compact radio emitting feature .",
    "our follow - up e - merlin observations revealed a rich morphology in the source at @xmath0ghz , but detected only one radio - emitting feature at @xmath1ghz .",
    "while the scenario involving dual radio - emitting agn can not be completely ruled out , our results are more indicative of one low - luminosity agn with two - sided jet and/or lobe - like features in j1425 + 3231 .",
