    "in this paper , we consider random instances of max 2-sat , max @xmath16-sat , and max cut . just as random instances of the decision problem 2-satshow a phase transition from almost - sure satisfiability to almost - sure unsatisfiability as the instance `` density '' increases above  1 , so the maximization problem shows a transition at the same point , with the expected number of clauses _ not _ satisfied by an optimal solution quickly changing from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "max cut experiences a similar phase transition : as a random graph s edge density crosses above @xmath20 , the number of edges _ not _ cut in an optimal cut suddenly changes from @xmath21 to @xmath19 .",
    "our methods are well established ones : the first - moment method for upper bounds ; algorithmic analysis including the differential - equation method for lower bounds ; and some more sophisticated arguments for the analysis of the scaling window .",
    "the interest of the work lies in the simplicity of the methods , and in the results .",
    "the questions we ask seem very natural , and the answers obtained for max 2-satand max cutare happily neat , and fairly comprehensive .    a preliminary version of this paper appeared as  @xcite .",
    "beyond our particular results for max 2-satand max cut , we hope to spark further work on phase transitions in random instances of other optimization problems , in particular of maxcsps ( constraint satisfaction problems ) .",
    "random instances of optimization problems have been studied extensively  some that come to mind are the travelling salesman problem , minimum spanning tree , minimum assignment , minimum bisection , minimum coloring , and maximum clique  but little has been said about _ phase transitions _ in such cases , and indeed many of the examples do not even have a natural parameter whose continuous variation could give rise to a phase transition .",
    "many problems , including all csps , have natural decision and optimization versions : one can ask whether a graph is @xmath16-colorable , or ask for the minimum number of colors it requires . we suggest that in a random setting , the optimization version is quite as interesting as the decision version",
    ". furthermore , optimization problems may plausibly be easier to analyze than decision problems because the quantities of interest vary more smoothly .",
    "in fact , a recent triumph in the analysis of a decision problem , the characterization of the `` scaling window '' for 2-sat , used as a smoothed quantity the size of the `` spine '' of a formula  @xcite . a way to view our max 2-satresults is that instead of taking the size of the spine as our `` order parameter '' , we take the size of a maximum satisfiable subformula .",
    "this seems comparably tractable ( we reproduce the result of @xcite incompletely , but more easily ) , and arguably more natural . generally , when a decision problem has an optimization analog , the value of the optimum is both interesting in its own right , and , we suggest , an obvious candidate order parameter for studying the decision problem .",
    "let @xmath0 be a @xmath16-satformula with @xmath1 variables @xmath22 .",

    "in particular , it is a canonical np - hard problem to determine if a given formula @xmath0 is satisfiable or not , except for @xmath17 when this decision problem is solvable in essentially linear time .",

    "let @xmath27 be chosen uniformly at random ; this is equivalent to choosing @xmath26 clauses uniformly at random , with replacement , from the @xmath28 possible clauses .",
    "the model is generally parametrized as @xmath29 for various `` densities '' @xmath8 , and the state of knowledge is summarized thus .",

    "recently , the `` scaling window '' @xmath32 has also been analyzed  @xcite . for @xmath16-sat ,",
    "much less is known . for 3-sat , for instance , it is known that for @xmath33 , @xmath0 is a.s.satisfiable  @xcite and for @xmath34 , @xmath0 is a.s.unsatisfiable  @xcite .",

    "the closest result to the satisfiability conjecture is a theorem of friedgut  @xcite proving similar thresholds , but leaving open the possibility that ( for a given  @xmath16 ) , each @xmath1 may have its own threshold , and that these may not converge to a limit .    [",

    "max 2-satis np - hard to solve exactly , and it is even np - hard to approximate @xmath3 to within a factor of @xmath44  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a @xmath45-approximation is trivial : a random assignment satisfies an expected @xmath45ths of the clauses , and a derandomized algorithm is simple ( our algorithm used to prove the lower bound for theorem  [ mainhighdens ] can serve ) .",

    "although both randomized and maximization versions of @xmath16-satare thus well studied , we are aware of no work on random max sat , nor other random maxor minconstraint satisfaction problems ( csps ) .",
    "these problems seem very natural , and answers to even the simplest questions are not obvious at first blush : for a random 2-satformula @xmath48 with @xmath31 , which is a.s.unsatisfiable , can we perhaps w.h.p.satisfy all but a single clause ?",
    "these questions have elegant answers ; we will show for example that random max 2-sathas a phase structure analogous to the decision problem s .",
    "and there is a hope that the maximization problems may help in understanding the decision problems .",
    "for 2-satthis hope is borne out to a degree by our theorem  [ mainscalingwindow ] .",
    "while our results for @xmath49 are very limited ( see theorem  [ ksat1 ] ) , conjectures  [ conjecture : limit ] and  [ conj2 ] link the open questions for the maximization and decision thresholds for random satisfiability . at this point",
    "we can not guess the comparative difficulties of resolving the satisfiability threshold conjecture , its maximization analog , or the conjectured link between them .    our study of random max 2-satand random max cutwas also motivated by recent work on `` avoiding a giant component ''",

    "we consider several aspects of random max 2-satand random max cut .",
    "we also extend the easiest results to arbitrary csps ( constraint satisfaction problems ) .    we will give a second motivation for considering problems of this sort when we take up max cut , in section  [ sec : cut ] .",
    "we write @xmath50 to denote a random 2-satformula on @xmath1 variables , with @xmath26 clauses .",
    "typically we will fix a constant @xmath8 and consider @xmath51 ; where it does not matter we will often write @xmath5 in lieu of @xmath2 and we often omit the notation @xmath52 in other instances . for any formula @xmath0 , define @xmath3 to be the size of a largest satisfiable subformula of  @xmath0 .",
    "our focus is the functional behavior of @xmath3 .",
    "similarly , we write @xmath53for a random graph on @xmath1 vertices with @xmath26 edges . for any graph @xmath54 ,",
    "let @xmath42 describe a partition of the vertices , and let @xmath55 be the number of edges having one vertex in each part of the partition .",
    "define @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "we use standard asymptotic and `` order '' notation , so for example @xmath58 means @xmath59 as @xmath30 , and @xmath60 means @xmath61 .",
    "we will also write @xmath62 to indicate that @xmath63 is less than or equal to @xmath64 _ asymptotically _  @xmath65  though it may be that @xmath66 even for arbitrarily large values of  @xmath1 .",
    "asymptotic results involving two variables , for example concerning 2-satformulae on @xmath1 variables with @xmath5 clauses , with @xmath8 large ( or @xmath67 clauses with @xmath37 small ) should always be interpreted as taking the limit in @xmath1 second ; thus `` for any desired error bound there exists a @xmath68 , such that for all @xmath69 there exists an @xmath70 , such that for all @xmath71 , '' etcetera .",
    "we establish several properties of random max 2-sat , random max @xmath16-sat , and random max cut , focusing on 2-sat .",
    "this section summarizes our main results and indicates the nature of the proofs ; further results and proofs are given in subsequent sections .",
    "one of our goals is to establish the max 2-satresults without depending on those for decision 2-sat , and in particular to work independently of  @xcite and reproduce its results .",
    "we enjoy some success in this ; the exceptions are our reliance on  @xcite for the upper bound in theorem  [ mainlowdens ] ( with an extraneous logarithmic factor arising in the translation ) , and a more acute form of the same problem in the scaling window , where we lack any corresponding bound for the @xmath72 case of theorem  [ mainscalingwindow ] .",

    ", so we would expect @xmath3 to be close to @xmath5 in this case ; the following theorem shows this to be true .",
    "the proof comes from counting the expected number of the `` bicycles '' shown by @xcite to be necessary components of an unsatisfiable formula .    for any @xmath8 , @xmath79 , since a random assignment of the variables satisfies each clause with probability @xmath80 .",

    "the following summary of the relevant facts , which we present informally , is distilled from  ( * ? ? ?",
    "5.4 ) .    first , if @xmath776 , then the number of vertices of @xmath777 belonging to unicyclic components is asymptotically almost surely @xmath778 .",
    "consider the components of a graph @xmath54 which are trees , unicyclic , or complex . in the supercritical phase with @xmath779 , a random graph @xmath742",
    "consists of tree components , unicyclic components , and no complex component other than a single `` giant component '' .",
    "the expected number of vertices in the cycles of the unicyclic components is of order @xmath128 .",
    "the giant component s 2-core has order @xmath780 , and is obtained as a random subdivision of the edges of a `` kernel '' , which is a random cubic graph on @xmath781 vertices .",
    "theorem  [ cutscaling ] : _ proof .",
    "_ we consider which edges of @xmath54 it may be impossible to cut .",
    "every edge in the tree components of @xmath782 can of course be cut . for each unicyclic component , at most 1 edge must go uncut ( if the cycle is odd ) . by the symmetry rule",
    "( see for example  ( * ? ? ? * theorem  5.24 ) ) , the number of unicyclic components for @xmath783 is essentially the same as for @xmath784 , which by theorem  [ cutsubcritical ] is only @xmath785 .",
    "the dominant contribution will come from the giant component .",
    "edges which are not in its 2-core can of course all be cut , even after a partition of the 2-core has been decided .",
    "moreover , an optimal partition of the 2-core is essentially decided by a partition of the vertices of the `` kernel '' , which is the 2-core where each path whose internal vertices are all of degree  2 is replaced by a single edge .",
    "( see ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "5.4 ) for more on the giant component , its core , and its kernel . ) for any cut of the kernel , each 2-core path corresponding to a kernel edge can be partitioned either perfectly or with one edge uncut , depending on the parity of the path s length and whether its endpoints are on the same side or opposite sides of the kernel s cut .",
    "equivalently , a kernel edge whose 2-core path is of odd length imposes a `` cut '' constraint on its endpoints , while a kernel edge whose 2-core path is of even length imposes an `` uncut '' constraint on its endpoints ; the number of these constraints violated by a cut of the kernel vertices is equal to the number of original cut constraints violated by an optimal extension of the same cut to all the 2-core vertices ( and indeed to all the giant - component vertices )",
    ".    since each kernel edge is randomly subdivided , on average into @xmath786 2-core edges , the parities of the kernel edges are almost perfectly random ( with the probability of either parity approaching @xmath180 as @xmath37 approaches  @xmath75 ) . for our purposes",
    "it suffices that either parity occurs with probability at most some absolute constant @xmath787 , and using this we show that at least some constant fraction @xmath788 of the approximately @xmath789 edge constraints must be violated .    fix a spanning tree @xmath790 of the kernel  @xmath320 , whose order we will write as @xmath791 ( expecting @xmath792 ) .",
    "let @xmath320 subsume not only the graph but also the edge parities , so that it is an instance of the generalized ( cut / uncut ) max cutproblem .",
    "if it is possible to violate precisely a fraction @xmath793 of @xmath320 s constraints then reversing precisely those constraints gives a perfectly satisfiable cut / uncut constraint problem instance  @xmath794 .",
    "fixing the `` side '' of any one vertex , the @xmath795 constraints from the spanning tree @xmath790 imply the rest of the cut , which must then satisfy the remaining @xmath796 constraints .",
    "viewing the parities of the spanning tree edges as arbitrary , and the remaining edges as independent random variables , the probability that the randomly chosen kernel edges satisfy each of these constraints is at most @xmath797 .",
    "the number of choices of @xmath798 edges to dissatisfy is @xmath799 .",
    "we guarantee an exponentially small probability of success by selecting @xmath800 to satisfy : @xmath801 where @xmath686 is the entropy function @xmath802 . in particular , in the case of interest where @xmath803 , @xmath804 and @xmath805 .",
    "recapitulating , we must dissatisfy @xmath806 kernel constraints , @xmath807 constraints of @xmath54 .",
    "the expected @xmath785 uncut edges from unicyclic components are negligible by comparison , so in all @xmath212 edges of @xmath54 go uncut .",
    "we have presented a road map for max 2-satand max cutin a random setting , establishing that there is a phase transition , and deriving asymptotics below the critical value , for constants slightly above the critical value and in the scaling window around it , and for larger constants .    for constant densities slightly above threshold",
    "there is a logarithmic gap between our lower and upper bounds ; we need to confirm that the @xmath808 factors are extraneous . in the other cases ,",
    "our bounds are only separated by a constant . however , in light of the exact result of @xcite for the size of a maximum subgraph which has no giant component , it would be wonderful to get the _ exact _ asymptotics of @xmath93 .    whether @xmath93 tends to a limit in @xmath1 ( see conjecture  [ conjecture : limit ] ) is to our minds a prime open problem in this area , and is not only in some sense analogous to the satisfiability threshold conjecture , but may also be directly connected with it ( see conjecture  [ conj2 ] ) , another important question .",
    "a question similar in spirit to conjecture  [ conjecture : limit ] was considered in  @xcite , which defines a certain linear - programming relaxation of max 2-sat .",
    "an instance in characterized by its `` distance to feasibility ''  @xmath809 , with @xmath810 the corresponding random variable for a random instance .",
    "it is shown that for every @xmath572 , @xmath811 almost surely converges to a limit .",
    "the result is established using powerful local weak convergence methods @xcite .",
    "it remains to be seen whether these methods are applicable to random maximum constraint satisfaction problems , including max 2-satand max cut .",
