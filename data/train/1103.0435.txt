    "many classical applications , such as radar and error - correcting codes , make use of over - complete spanning systems @xcite .",
    "oftentimes , we may view an over - complete spanning system as a _",
    "frame_. take @xmath0 to be a collection of vectors in some separable hilbert space @xmath1 .",
    "then @xmath2 is a frame if there exist _ frame bounds _ @xmath3 and @xmath4 with @xmath5 such that @xmath6 for every @xmath7 .",
    "when @xmath8 , @xmath2 is called a _",
    "tight frame_. for finite - dimensional unit norm frames , where @xmath9 , the _ worst - case coherence _ is a useful parameter : @xmath10 note that orthonormal bases are tight frames with @xmath11 and have zero worst - case coherence . in both ways , frames form a natural generalization of orthonormal bases .    in this paper",
    ", we only consider finite - dimensional frames .",
    "those not familiar with frame theory can simply view a finite - dimensional frame as an @xmath12 matrix of rank @xmath13 whose columns are the frame elements .",
    "with this view , the tightness condition is equivalent to having the spectral norm be as small as possible ; for an @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 , this equivalently means @xmath14 .    throughout the literature , applications require finite - dimensional frames that are nearly tight and have small worst - case coherence @xcite . among these ,",
    "a foremost application is sparse signal processing , where frames of small spectral norm and/or small worst - case coherence are commonly used to analyze sparse signals @xcite . in general , sparse signal processing deals with measurements of the form @xmath15 where @xmath2 is @xmath12 with @xmath16 , @xmath17 has at most @xmath18 nonzero entries , and @xmath19 is some sort of noise . when given measurements @xmath20 of @xmath17 , one might be asked to reconstruct the original sparse vector @xmath17 , or to find the locations of its nonzero entries , or to simply determine whether @xmath17 is nonzero  each of these is a sparse signal processing problem . in some applications ,",
    "the signal @xmath17 is sparse in the identity basis , in which case @xmath2 represents the measurement process . in other applications",
    ", @xmath17 is sparse in an orthonormal basis or an overcomplete dictionary @xmath21 @xcite . in this case",
    ", @xmath2 is a composition of @xmath3 , the frame resulting from the measurement process , and @xmath21 , the sparsifying dictionary , i.e. , @xmath22 .",
    "we do not make a distinction between the two formulations in this paper , but our results are most readily interpretable in a physical setting for the former case .",
    "recently , @xcite introduced another notion of frame coherence called _ average coherence _ : @xmath23 note that , in addition to having zero worst - case coherence , orthonormal bases also have zero average coherence . intuitively , worst - case coherence is a measure of dissimilarity between frame elements , whereas average coherence measures how well the frame elements are distributed in the unit hypersphere . in sparse signal processing ,",
    "there are a number of performance guarantees that depend only on worst - case coherence @xcite .",
    "these guarantees at best allow for sparsity levels on the order of @xmath24 .",
    "compressed sensing has brought guarantees that depend on the restricted isometry property , which is much more difficult to check , but the guarantees allow for sparsity levels on the order of @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite used worst - case and average coherence to produce _ probabilistic _ guarantees that also allow for sparsity levels on the order of @xmath25 ; these guarantees require that worst - case and average coherence together satisfy the following property :    we say an @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 satisfies the _ strong coherence property _ if @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are given by and , respectively .",
    "the reader should know that the constant @xmath29 is not particularly essential to the above definition ; it is used in @xcite to simplify some analysis and make certain performance guarantees explicit , but the constant is by no means optimal .",
    "this in mind , the requirement ( scp-1 ) can be interpreted more generally as @xmath30 . in the next section",
    ", we will use the strong coherence property to continue the work of @xcite .",
    "where @xcite provided guarantees for noiseless reconstruction , we will produce near - optimal guarantees for signal detection and reconstruction from _ noisy _ measurements of sparse signals .",
    "these guarantees are related to those in @xcite , and we will also elaborate on this relationship .    the results given in @xcite and section  2 , as well as the applications discussed in @xcite demonstrate a pressing need for nearly tight frames with small worst - case and average coherence , especially in the area of sparse signal processing .",
    "this paper offers three additional contributions in this regard . in section  3",
    ", we provide a sizable catalog of frames that exhibit small spectral norm , worst - case coherence , and average coherence . with all three frame parameters provably small ,",
    "these frames are guaranteed to perform well in relevant applications .",
    "next , performance in many applications is dictated by worst - case coherence @xcite .",
    "it is therefore particularly important to understand which worst - case coherence values are achievable . to this end",
    ", the welch bound @xcite is commonly used in the literature . however , the welch bound is only tight when the number of frame elements @xmath31 is less than the square of the spatial dimension @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "another lower bound , given in @xcite , beats the welch bound when there are more frame elements , but it is known to be loose for real frames @xcite .",
    "given this context , section  4 gives a new lower bound on the worst - case coherence of real frames .",
    "our bound beats both the welch bound and the bound in @xcite when the number of frame elements far exceeds the spatial dimension .",
    "finally , since average coherence is so new , there is currently no intuition as to when ( scp-2 ) is satisfied . in section  5",
    ", we use ideas akin to the switching equivalence of graphs to transform a frame that satisfies ( scp-1 ) into another frame with the same spectral norm and worst - case coherence that additionally satisfies ( scp-2 ) .    throughout the paper , we make use of certain notations that we address here .",
    "recall , with big - o notation , that @xmath32 if there exists positive @xmath33 and @xmath34 such that for all @xmath35 , @xmath36 . also , @xmath37 if @xmath38 , and @xmath39 if @xmath32 and @xmath38",
    ". additionally , we use @xmath40 to denote the matrix whose columns are taken from the matrix @xmath2 according to the index set @xmath41 .",
    "similarly , we use @xmath42 to denote the column vector whose entries are taken from the column vector @xmath17 according to the index set @xmath41 . the column vector of the @xmath43 largest entries in column vector @xmath17",
    "is denoted by @xmath44 .",
    "we also use @xmath45 to denote the @xmath46 norm of a vector @xmath17 , while @xmath47 is the spectral norm of a matrix @xmath2 .",
    "lastly , we use a star ( @xmath48 ) to denote the matrix adjoint , a dagger ( @xmath49 ) to denote the matrix pseudoinverse , and @xmath50 to denote the @xmath51 identity matrix .",
    "frames with small spectral norm , worst - case coherence , and/or average coherence have found use in recent years with applications involving sparse signals .",
    "donoho et al .",
    "used the worst - case coherence in @xcite to provide uniform bounds on the signal and support recovery performance of combinatorial and convex optimization methods and greedy algorithms .",
    "later , tropp @xcite and cands and plan @xcite used both the spectral norm and worst - case coherence to provide tighter bounds on the signal and support recovery performance of convex optimization methods for most support sets under the additional assumption that the sparse signals have independent nonzero entries with zero median .",
    "recently , bajwa et al .",
    "@xcite made use of the spectral norm and both coherence parameters to report tighter bounds on the noisy model selection and noiseless signal recovery performance of an incredibly fast greedy algorithm called _ one - step thresholding ( ost ) _ for most support sets and _ arbitrary _ nonzero entries . in this section , we discuss further implications of the spectral norm and worst - case and average coherence of frames in applications involving sparse signals .      a common task in signal processing applications is to test whether a collection of measurements corresponds to mere noise @xcite . for applications involving sparse signals",
    ", one can test measurements @xmath52 against the null hypothsis @xmath53 and alternative hypothesis @xmath54 , where the entries of the noise vector @xmath55 are independent , identical zero - mean complex - gaussian random variables and the signal @xmath56 is @xmath18-sparse .",
    "the performance of such signal detection problems is directly proportional to the energy in @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "in particular , existing literature on the detection of sparse signals @xcite leverages the fact that @xmath58 when @xmath2 satisfies the restricted isometry property ( rip ) of order @xmath18 .",
    "in contrast , we now show that the strong coherence property also guarantees @xmath58 for most @xmath18-sparse vectors .",
    "we start with a definition :    [ def : wrip ] we say an @xmath12 frame @xmath2 satisfies the _ @xmath59-weak restricted isometry property ( weak rip ) _ if for every @xmath18-sparse vector @xmath60 , a random permutation @xmath17 of @xmath20 s entries satisfies @xmath61 with probability exceeding @xmath62 .    at first glance , it may seem odd that we introduce a random permutation when we might as well define weak rip in terms of a @xmath18-sparse vector whose support is drawn randomly from all @xmath63 possible choices .",
    "in fact , both versions would be equivalent in distribution , but we stress that in the present definition , the values of the nonzero entries of @xmath17 are _ not _ random ; rather , the only randomness we have is in the locations of the nonzero entries .",
    "we wish to distinguish our results from those in @xcite , which explicitly require randomness in the values of the nonzero entries .",
    "we also note the distinction between rip and weak rip  weak rip requires that @xmath2 preserves the energy of _ most _ sparse vectors .",
    "moreover , the manner in which we quantify `` most '' is important . for each sparse vector ,",
    "@xmath2 preserves the energy of most permutations of that vector , but for different sparse vectors , @xmath2 might not preserve the energy of permutations with the same support .",
    "that is , unlike rip , weak rip is _ not _ a statement about the singular values of submatrices of @xmath2 .",
    "certainly , matrices for which most submatrices are well - conditioned , such as those discussed in @xcite , will satisfy weak rip , but weak rip does not require this .",
    "that said , the following theorem shows , in part , the significance of the strong coherence property .",
    "[ thm.wrip ] any @xmath12 unit norm frame @xmath2 that satisfies the strong coherence property also satisfies the @xmath64-weak restricted isometry property provided @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "let @xmath17 be as in definition  [ def : wrip ] .",
    "note that is equivalent to @xmath67 .",
    "defining @xmath68 , then the cauchy - schwarz inequality gives @xmath69 where the last inequality uses the fact that @xmath70 in @xmath71 .",
    "we now consider ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3 ) , which states that for any @xmath72 and @xmath73 , @xmath74 with probability exceeding @xmath75 provided @xmath76 .",
    "we claim that together with ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemma  3 ) guarantee @xmath67 with probability exceeding @xmath77 . in order to establish this claim , we fix @xmath78 and @xmath79 .",
    "it is then easy to see that ( scp-1 ) gives @xmath80 , and also that ( scp-2 ) and @xmath81 give @xmath82 .",
    "therefore , since the assumption that @xmath65 together with @xmath81 implies @xmath83 , we obtain @xmath84 .",
    "the result now follows from the observation that @xmath85 implies @xmath86 .",
    "this theorem shows that having small worst - case and average coherence is enough to guarantee weak rip .",
    "this contrasts with related results by tropp @xcite that require @xmath2 to be nearly tight .",
    "in fact , the proof of theorem  [ thm.wrip ] does not even use the full power of the strong coherence property ; instead of ( scp-1 ) , it suffices to have @xmath87 , part of what @xcite calls the coherence property .",
    "also , if @xmath2 has worst - case coherence @xmath88 and average coherence @xmath89 , then even if @xmath2 has large spectral norm , theorem  [ thm.wrip ] states that @xmath2 preserves the energy of most @xmath18-sparse vectors with @xmath90 , i.e. , the sparsity regime which is linear in the number of measurements .",
    "another common task in signal processing applications is to reconstruct a @xmath18-sparse signal @xmath56 from a small collection of linear measurements @xmath91 .",
    "recently , tropp @xcite used both the worst - case coherence and spectral norm of frames to find bounds on the reconstruction performance of _ basis pursuit ( bp ) _",
    "@xcite for most support sets under the assumption that the nonzero entries of @xmath17 are independent with zero median .",
    "in contrast , @xcite used the spectral norm and worst - case and average coherence of frames to find bounds on the reconstruction performance of ost for most support sets and _ arbitrary _ nonzero entries .",
    "however , both @xcite and @xcite limit themselves to recovering @xmath17 in the absence of noise , corresponding to @xmath92 , a rather ideal scenario .",
    "our goal in this section is to provide guarantees for the reconstruction of sparse signals from noisy measurements @xmath93 , where the entries of the noise vector @xmath55 are independent , identical complex - gaussian random variables with mean zero and variance @xmath94 . in particular , and in contrast with @xcite",
    ", our guarantees will hold for arbitrary unit norm frames @xmath2 without requiring the signal s sparsity level to satisfy @xmath95 . the reconstruction algorithm that we analyze here is the ost algorithm of @xcite , which is described in algorithm  [ alg : ost_recon ] .",
    "the following theorem extends the analysis of @xcite and shows that the ost algorithm leads to near - optimal reconstruction error for certain important classes of sparse signals .    before proceeding further ,",
    "we first define some notation .",

    "hence , conditioning on @xmath132 and @xmath133 , we have that @xmath134 since @xmath135 is a submatrix of a full column rank matrix @xmath40 .",

    "we can now substitute these bounds into and make use of the fact that @xmath144 to conclude that @xmath145 given @xmath132 and @xmath136 . at this point , define the event @xmath146 and note from ( * ? ? ?",

    "a few remarks are in order now for theorem  [ thm : rsp ] .",
    "first , if @xmath2 satisfies the strong coherence property _ and _ @xmath2 is nearly tight , then ost handles sparsity that is almost linear in @xmath13 : @xmath152 from .",
    "second , we do not impose any control over the size of @xmath43 , but rather we state the result in generality in terms of @xmath43 ; its size is determined by the signal class @xmath17 belongs to , the worst - case coherence of the frame @xmath2 we use to measure @xmath17 , and the magnitude of the noise that perturbs @xmath57 .",
    "third , the @xmath153 error associated with the ost algorithm is the near - optimal ( modulo the @xmath154 factor ) error of @xmath155 _ plus _ the best @xmath43-term approximation error caused by the inability of the ost algorithm to recover signal entries that are smaller than @xmath156 . in particular , if the @xmath18-sparse signal @xmath17 , the worst - case coherence @xmath27 , and the noise @xmath19 together satisfy @xmath157 , then the ost algorithm succeeds with a near - optimal @xmath153 error of @xmath158 . to see why this error is near - optimal , note that a @xmath18-dimension vector of random entries with mean zero and variance @xmath94 has expected squared norm @xmath159 ; in our case , we pay an additional log factor to find the locations of the @xmath18 nonzero entries among the entire @xmath31-dimensional signal .",
    "it is important to recognize that the optimality condition @xmath157 depends on the signal class , the noise variance , and the worst - case coherence of the frame ; in particular , the condition is satisfied whenever @xmath160 , since @xmath161 the following lemma provides classes of sparse signals that satisfy @xmath162 given sufficiently small noise variance and worst - case coherence , and consequently the ost algorithm is near - optimal for the reconstruction of such signal classes .",
    "[ lem : ost_opt_cond ] take an @xmath102 unit norm frame @xmath2 with worst - case coherence @xmath163 for some @xmath164 , and suppose that @xmath165 for some @xmath166 .",

    "then @xmath173 , provided @xmath174 .",
    "let @xmath41 be the support of @xmath17 , and define @xmath175 .",

    "this subsumes a very important class of signals that appears in applications such as multi - label prediction @xcite , in which all the nonzero entries take values @xmath181 . to the best of our knowledge ,",
    "theorem  [ thm : rsp ] is the first result in the sparse signal processing literature that does not require rip and still provides near - optimal reconstruction guarantees for such signals from noisy measurements , while using either random or deterministic frames , even when @xmath152 .",
    "we note that our techniques can be extended to reconstruct noisy signals , that is , we may consider measurements of the form @xmath182 , where @xmath183 is also a noise vector of independent , identical zero - mean complex - gaussian random variables .",
    "in particular , if the frame @xmath2 is tight , then our measurements will not color the noise , and so noise in the signal may be viewed as noise in the measurements : @xmath184 ; if the frame is not tight , then the noise will become correlated in the measurements , and performance would be depend nontrivially on the frame s gram matrix . also , the authors have had some success with generalizing theorem  [ thm : rsp ] to approximately sparse signals ; the analysis follows similiar lines , but is rather cumbersome , and it appears as though the end result is only strong enough in the case of very nearly sparse signals . as such , we omit this result .",
    "in this section , we consider a range of nearly tight frames with small worst - case and average coherence .",

    "when @xmath31 is between @xmath346 and @xmath540 , the best bound to date is the ( loose ) welch bound , and so more work needs to be done to bound worst - case coherence in this parameter region .",
    "in @xcite , average coherence is used to derive a number of guarantees on sparse signal processing . since",
    "average coherence is so new to the frame theory literature , this section will investigate how average coherence relates to worst - case coherence and the spectral norm .",
    "we start with a definition :    [ def.flipping and wiggling ] we say the frames @xmath2 and @xmath21 are _ wiggling equivalent _ if there exists a diagonal matrix @xmath541 of unimodular entries such that @xmath542 .",
    "furthermore , they are _ flipping equivalent _ if @xmath541 is real , having only @xmath428 s on the diagonal .",
    "the terms `` wiggling '' and `` flipping '' are inspired by the fact that individual frame elements of such equivalent frames are related by simple unitary operations .",
    "note that every frame with @xmath31 nonzero frame elements belongs to a flipping equivalence class of size @xmath543 , while being wiggling equivalent to uncountably many frames .",
    "the importance of this type of frame equivalence is , in part , due to the following lemma , which characterizes the shared geometry of wiggling equivalent frames :    [ lem : geom_eqframes ] wiggling equivalence preserves the norms of frame elements , the worst - case coherence , and the spectral norm .",
    "take two frames @xmath2 and @xmath21 such that @xmath542 .",
    "the first claim is immediate .",
    "next , the gram matrices are related by @xmath544 . since corresponding off - diagonal entries are equal in modulus , we know the worst - case coherences are equal",
    "finally , @xmath545 , and so we are done .",
    "wiggling and flipping equivalence are not entirely new to frame theory . for a real equiangular tight frame @xmath2 , the gram matrix @xmath546",
    "is completely determined by the sign pattern of the off - diagonal entries , which can in turn be interpreted as the seidel adjacency matrix of a graph @xmath547 . as such , flipping a frame element @xmath548 has the effect of negating the corresponding row and column in the gram matrix , which further corresponds to _ switching _ the adjacency rule for that vertex @xmath549 in the graph ",
    "vertices are adjacent to @xmath550 after switching precisely when they were not adjacent before switching .",
    "graphs are called _ switching equivalent _ if there is a sequence of switching operations that produces one graph from the other ; this equivalence was introduced in @xcite and was later extensively studied by seidel in @xcite . since flipping equivalent real equiangular tight frames correspond to switching equivalent graphs , the terms have become interchangeable .",
    "for example , @xcite uses switching ( i.e. , wiggling and flipping ) equivalence to make progress on an important problem in frame theory called the _ paulsen problem _ , which asks how close a nearly unit norm , nearly tight frame must be to a unit norm tight frame .    now that we understand wiggling and flipping equivalence , we are ready for the main idea behind this section .",
    "suppose we are given a unit norm frame with acceptable spectral norm and worst - case coherence , but we also want the average coherence to satisfy ( scp-2 ) . then by lemma  [ lem : geom_eqframes ] , all of the wiggling equivalent frames will also have acceptable spectral norm and worst - case coherence , and so it is reasonable to check these frames for good average coherence .",
    "in fact , the following theorem guarantees that at least one of the flipping equivalent frames will have good average coherence , with only modest requirements on the original frame s redundancy .",
    "[ thm : avc_rand ] let @xmath2 be an @xmath12 unit norm frame with @xmath551 .",
    "then there exists a frame @xmath21 that is flipping equivalent to @xmath2 and satisfies @xmath552 .",
    "take @xmath553 to be a rademacher sequence that independently takes values @xmath428 , each with probability @xmath554 .",
    "we use this sequence to randomly flip @xmath2 ; define @xmath555 . note that if @xmath556 , we are done . fix some @xmath557 .",
    "then @xmath558 we can view @xmath559 as a sum of @xmath235 independent zero - mean complex random variables that are bounded by @xmath27 .",
    "we can therefore use a complex version of hoeffding s inequality @xcite ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ? * lemma  3.8 ) ) to bound the probability expression in as @xmath560 . from here , a union bound over all @xmath31 choices for @xmath227 gives @xmath561 , and so @xmath562 implies @xmath563 , as desired .",
    "while theorem  [ thm : avc_rand ] guarantees the existence of a flipping equivalent frame with good average coherence , the result does not describe how to find it .",
    "certainly , one could check all @xmath543 frames in the flipping equivalence class , but such a procedure is computationally slow . as an alternative , we propose a linear - time flipping algorithm ( algorithm  [ alg : flipping ] ) .",
    "the following theorem guarantees that linear - time flipping will produce a frame with good average coherence , but it requires the original frame s redundancy to be higher than what suffices in theorem  [ thm : avc_rand ] .",
