    "within the nucleon excited states ( @xmath5 ) the @xmath0 resonance , also known as roper , plays a special role .",
    "contrarily to the @xmath6 and other nucleon excitations , the roper was not identified as a bump in a reaction cross - section but was instead found in the analysis of phase - shifts  @xcite .",
    "nowadays there is evidence that the roper should be identified as the first radial excitation of the nucleon quark core , although meson excitations are also important for the internal structure",
    ".    calculations based on valence quark degrees of freedom are consistent with the @xmath1 transition form factors for large @xmath2 ( @xmath7 gev@xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "however , estimates based exclusively on quark degrees of freedom fail to describe the small @xmath2 data ( @xmath8 gev@xmath4 )  @xcite .",
    "the gap between valence quark models and the data at low @xmath2 has been interpreted as the manifestation of the meson cloud effects  @xcite . when the meson cloud contributions are included in quark models the estimates approach the data  @xcite .",
    "besides , the calculations based on dynamical coupled - channel reaction models , where the baryon excitations are described as baryon - meson states with extended baryon cores  @xcite , corroborates the importance of the meson cloud effects . in those models",
    "the mass associated with the roper bare core is about 1.7 gev . only when the meson cloud dressing is considered the roper mass is reduced to the experimental value  @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the roper as a radial excitation of the nucleon combined with a dynamical meson cloud dressing solves the long standing problem of the roper mass in the context of a quark model  @xcite .",
    "the roper decay widths into @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are large comparative to other @xmath5 decays .",
    "those decay widths are also difficult to explain in the context of a quark model .",
    "the meson cloud dressing helps to explain the @xmath12 width , where the contributions associated with baryon - meson - meson states play an important role  @xcite .",
    "overall the recent developments in the study of the roper electromagnetic structure point to the picture of a radial excitation of the nucleon surrounded by a cloud of mesons  @xcite . there is therefore a strong motivation to study the roper internal structure and to disentangle the effects of the valence quark component from the meson cloud component . in particular , one can use the knowledge of the baryon core structure to infer the contribution due to the meson cloud .",
    "this procedure was used in previous works based on different frameworks for the baryon core  @xcite .    in the case of the nucleon",
    "the valence quark degrees of freedom produce the dominant effect in the elastic form factors .",
    "the meson cloud contribution to the nucleon wave function is estimated to be of the order of a few percent  @xcite .",
    "as for the roper , the meson cloud seems to play a more prominent role .",
    "we conclude at the end that the valence quark degrees of freedom provide a very good description of the data , but the meson cloud contribution are important below 1.5 gev@xmath4 , particularly for the dirac form factor .    in the present work we propose a new framework to analyze the role of the valence quarks and the meson cloud in the roper .",
    "we use llight - front holography to estimate the leading order ( lowest fock state ) contribution to the @xmath1 transition form factors .",
    "since the leading order calculation includes only pure valence quark effects in the baryon wave functions ( @xmath13 contributions ) , there is no contribution from the meson cloud . in those conditions",
    "the gap between the calculations and the data must be essentially the consequence of the meson cloud effects .    the light - front ( lf ) formalism is particularly appropriate to study hadron systems , ruled by qcd , and to describe the hadronic structure in terms of the constituents  @xcite .",
    "the lf wave functions ( lfwf ) are relativistic and frame independent  @xcite .",
    "the connection between lf quantization of qcd and anti - de - sitter conformal field theory ( ads / cft ) leads to light - front holography  @xcite .",
    "lf holography have been used to study the structure of hadron properties , such as the hadron mass spectrum , parton distribution functions , meson and baryon form factors etc .",
    "in particular , the formalism was recently applied to the study of the nucleon  @xcite and roper  @xcite electromagnetic structure .",
    "an important advantage of the lf formalism applied to hadronic physics is the systematic expansion of the wave functions into fock states with different number of constituents  @xcite . in the case of the baryons",
    "the leading order contributions is restricted to the three - valence quark configuration .",
    "although the restriction to the lowest order fock state ( three valence - quark system ) may look as a rough simulation of the real world , it may provide an excellent first approximation when the confinement is included in the lfwf , defined at the light - front time  @xcite . in those conditions",
    "non - perturbative physics is effectively taken into account by lf holography  @xcite .    under the assumption that lf holography can describe accurately the large-@xmath2 region dominated by valence quark degrees of freedom , we calibrate the free parameters of the model by the available data above a given threshold @xmath14 ( @xmath152.5 gev@xmath4 ) .",
    "this procedure differs from the previous studies where the free parameters , associated with the nucleon anomalous magnetic moments were fixed at @xmath16 , where the meson cloud contamination is expected to be stronger .",
    "once the free parameters are fixed by the nucleon data , one uses the model to calculate the @xmath1 transition form factors . since no parameter is adjusted by the roper data , our calculations are true predictions for the @xmath1 transition form factors .",

    "light - front quantization provides a powerful tool to study systems ruled by microscopic qcd dynamics .",
    "it starts with introducing a special ( light - front ) parametrization of the hamiltonian , which consequently acts on a hilbert space of the lfwf spanned by partonic fock states associated with quarks and gluons  @xcite .",

    "in the bottom - up holographic approach to qcd the nucleon and the nucleon excitations can be introduced as fermion fields in five - dimensional ads space  @xcite . to define this curved space one requires the metric tensor @xmath36 , which can be conveniently introduced via line element @xmath37 in the poincar coordinates :",

    "<S> the model compares well with the @xmath1 transition form factor data , suggesting that meson cloud effects are not large , except in the region @xmath3 gev@xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the meson cloud contributions for the pauli form factor are small . </S>"
