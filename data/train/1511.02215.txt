    "in the last 15 years a large amount of data on electroproduction of mesons was accumulated at different facilities , with the purpose of determining the resonance contribution to the cross sections and identifying the members of the excited baryon spectrum .",
    "the goal is to obtain a precise description of the first excited states of the ground state baryons , which is an important test for our understanding of qcd in the low - energy , strong - coupling regime .",
    "models try to capture the most relevant physics giving a description in terms of effective degrees of freedom , but it is hard to make an estimate of the theoretical errors involved and there is little guide on how to improve on them . on the other hand ,",
    "lattice calculations are based on first principles and recently they have shown a significant progress in the determination of the light baryon mass spectrum and the identification of the spin - parity of the excited states @xcite .",
    "the lattice results seem to confirm the old quark model picture , where the light - flavored baryons fill irreducible representations of the orbital @xmath2 spin - flavor group @xmath3 .",
    "empirically there are still many missing states in the spin - flavor multiplets of the quark model , an old problem that has constantly spurred the experimental program in the search of new resonances . for recent reviews on the experimental status of excited baryons and quark model",
    "related discussions see @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "an alternative approach to study the phenomenology of baryons is to consider the large @xmath4 limit of qcd @xcite @xcite , where it has been shown that the spin - flavor symmetry for baryons arises from consistency relations for pion - nucleon scattering @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the predictions of this symmetry for the masses and the couplings explain some of the successes of the non - relativistic quark model @xcite .",
    "the breaking of the spin - flavor symmetry can be studied systematically in a @xmath0 expansion using quark operators , establishing a deep connection between qcd and the quark model @xcite @xcite @xcite .",
    "the @xmath0 expansion was first applied to the masses and axial couplings of ground state baryons @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite and later to study the masses of the negative parity @xmath1 excited baryons @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite @xcite with great success .",
    "the strong and electromagnetic properties of these states , as well as of resonances in other spin - flavor multiplets have also been studied in the @xmath0 expansion and a number of interesting results were obtained , see @xcite for a review , and references therein .",
    "recently , the @xmath0 expansion has also been put in connection with the lattice calculations of the baryon spectrum @xcite @xcite @xcite discussing the spin - flavor composition of the baryons and the quark mass dependence of the results . however , in the systematic operator expansion provided by the @xmath0 approach , all the non - perturbative dynamics remains hidden in the values of the operator coefficients that in a phenomenological analysis have to be fitted to data .",
    "the physics driving the relative numerical sizes of operator coefficients remains unknown .",
    "comparison with the results of lattice calculations give some insight on their quark mass dependence but an interpretation in terms of effective degrees of freedom and their interactions is missing .",
    "it is therefore very desirable to put the @xmath0 expansion in closer connection with dynamical calculations , such as the one provided by the quark model , in order to arrive at a simple physical picture in terms of effective degrees of freedom . as a first step toward this goal ,",

    "configuration mixing was neglected as has been done in previous @xmath0 analysis , noting that this mixing is driven by the numerically suppressed spin - orbit operators @xcite .",
    "the general spin - flavor structure of the interactions can be reduced to two extreme cases , where we only have flavor independent interactions as obtained in model interactions based on one - gluon exchange ( oge ) , or flavor dependent interactions that arise in model interactions based on one - meson exchange ( ome ) . considering different spin - flavor structures for the interaction",
    "we obtain several new mass - angle relations that are parameter free . even in the most general case they are sufficient to constrain the mixing angles .",
