    "this article concerns the transverse - field ising model , introduced in  @xcite and a well - known generalization of the familiar ( classical ) ising model for ferromagnetism .",
    "the model possesses a phase transition and a critical point , which may be identified using the _ ( residual ) magnetization_. the magnetization equals zero below the critical point and is positive above it . an important result for",
    "the classical ising model is that the magnetization also vanishes _ at _ the critical point : in two dimensions this goes back to the work of onsager  @xcite , in dimension @xmath2 it was first proved by aizenman and fernndez  @xcite , and recently the final case @xmath3 was established by aizenman , duminil - copin and sidoravicius  @xcite .",
    "building on the methods of  @xcite , the present work shows that the magnetization in the transverse - field model also vanishes at the critical point .",
    "this implies that there is a unique equilibrium state at the critical point .",
    "we give precise statements shortly , but first introduce the relevant notation and definitions .",
    "let @xmath4 and write @xmath5^d=\\{-n ,-",
    "n+2,\\dotsc , n-1,n\\}^d\\ ] ] for a finite box in @xmath6 .",
    "the transverse - field ising model is defined via its hamiltonian , which in the finite volume @xmath7 takes the form @xmath8 here the first sum is over all ( unordered ) nearest neighbours in @xmath7 , @xmath9 are the spin-@xmath10 pauli matrices , and @xmath11 .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 and @xmath13 are nonnegative and represent spin - coupling and field - strengths , respectively .",
    "@xmath14 is an operator on the hilbert space @xmath15 , and one defines for each @xmath16 the state @xmath17 by @xmath18 the parameter @xmath19 is referred to as _",
    "inverse temperature_. ( readers with a probabilistic background may prefer the ` path integral ' definition of @xmath17 given in section  [ spin_sec ] . )    of particular interest are the one- and two - point functions @xmath20 and more general correlation functions @xmath21 as written , these are analytical functions of the model parameters @xmath22",
    ". however , one is interested in their their limits as @xmath23 or @xmath24 .",
    "( existence of the limits is well - known , see eg  @xcite or  @xcite . )",
    "these need not be analytical , or even continuous : for example if @xmath25 then by symmetry @xmath26 , whereas the residual magnetization @xmath27 may be strictly positive .",
    "this leads to the definition of the _ critical point _",
    "@xmath28 note that @xmath29 may also be defined in terms of the uniqueness of the infinite - volume states ( for all boundary conditions ) , or the divergence of the susceptibility , see  @xcite .",
    "we have that @xmath30 if @xmath0 , or if @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "the case @xmath31 is referred to as the _ ground state _ and the case @xmath33 as _ positive temperature_.    the following is the main result of this work :    [ main_thm ] let @xmath34 . if @xmath31 and @xmath0 , or @xmath33 and @xmath35 , then the residual magnetization satisfies @xmath36    if @xmath37 one recovers the classical ising model ; it is then standard to take @xmath38 and vary the parameter @xmath19 , giving the critical point @xmath39 which is positive and finite if @xmath0 . as remarked above , in this case",
    "the result is well - known . for @xmath34 the case when @xmath31 and @xmath40 is also known and was established in  @xcite ( and reproved in  @xcite using graphical methods ) .",
    "the other cases are new .",
    "note that the only nontrivial case left open by theorem  [ main_thm ] is when @xmath33 and @xmath41 , which remains open for @xmath34 .",
    "like the previous works  @xcite on the classical model , our proof of theorem  [ main_thm ] uses _ graphical representations_. for the classical ising model , and related models such as the potts model , the use of graphical representations is a standard tool and has been a huge success since the seminal work of fortuin and kasteleyn  @xcite . in more recent times graphical representations",
    "have also been very successful in the study of quantum models , not only the ising model  @xcite but also heisenberg models  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "the transverse - field ising model possesses at least three graphical representations , which may be called firstly the space  time spin representation , secondly the random - parity representation , and thirdly the fk - representation .",
    "the first of these goes back to  @xcite , the last to to  @xcite , whereas the second was developed in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite for the related random - current representation ) .",
    "these graphical representations are obtained by applying the lie ",
    "trotter expansion to the correlations functions   using the eigenbasis for either @xmath42 or @xmath43 , see  @xcite",
    ".    of primary importance for the present work is the random - parity representation , which is described in section  [ rpr_sec ] .",
    "it is a continuous version of the random - current representation for the classical ising model , developed in  @xcite .",
    "the key insight of the works  @xcite was that the phase transition in the ( classical ) ising model relates to a percolation transition for the random currents , and the present work exploits a similar picture for the quantum model .",
    "in addition to graphical representations , the other key component of the proof of theorem  [ main_thm ] is an _ infrared bound _ proved in  @xcite , and stated below in  .",
    "this is a bound on the fourier - transform of the schwinger function : @xmath44 infrared bounds go back to  @xcite and one of their great successes is the proof by dyson , lieb and simon  @xcite of the existence of a phase transition in the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model .",
    "see also  @xcite for a recent infrared bound for the heisenberg model in the same spirit as the bound employed here .",
    "the argument for proving theorem  [ main_thm ] follows the general outline of the argument for the classical model given in  @xcite . the first step is to develop an infinite - volume version of the random - parity representation and study percolation under this measure , see section  [ infvol_sec ] .",
    "the infrared bound is used to show that when @xmath45 then ( for @xmath33 and @xmath35 or @xmath31 and @xmath0 ) there is no unbounded percolation cluster , see proposition  [ crit - perc_prop ] .",
    "combined with ` local modifcations ' of the random - parity representation ( proposition  [ local_prop ] ) and the switching lemma ( lemma  [ sw_lem ] ) , this allows us to deduce the result , as described in section  [ proof_sec ] .",
    "compared with the classical model  @xcite , the main difficulty in the present work arises from the ` continuous ' nature of the graphical representations in the quantum setting .",
    "for example , the configuration space of the random - parity representation is non - compact so an argument is needed to obtain tightness of the sequence of finite - volume random - parity measures ( see proposition  [ weak_prop ] ) .",
    "related difficulties arise in proving insertion tolerance ( see proposition  [ local_prop ] ) and ergodicity ( see lemma  [ mix_lem ] ) .",
    "in the rest of this article we fix @xmath34 .",
    "we also set @xmath25 and use the equality of the residual and spontaneous magnetization  .",
    "we use the abbreviation tfim for transverse - field ising model , and we use the following probabilistic notation : @xmath46 or @xmath47 for the indicator function taking value 1 if the event @xmath48 occurs , 0 otherwise , and @xmath49 for the expectation of the random variable @xmath50 under the probability measure @xmath51 .",
    "in this section we present two graphical representations of the tfim , namely the space  time spin representation and the random - parity representation .",
    "the latter represents the correlation functions   and schwinger functions   in terms of expectations over random ` paths ' and is of central importance to this work .",
    "a major technical tool in this representation is the _ switching lemma _ , which we describe in section  [ switch_sec ] . in section  [ local_sec ]",
    "we then prove some results on ` local modifications ' in this representation , which are forms of insertion- and deletion tolerance .",
    "the space ",
    "time spin representation has a less prominent role in the main argument than the random - parity representation , and is used mainly to establish an ergodicity property of the infinite - volume random - parity representation ( see lemma  [ mix_lem ] and proposition  [ ergodic_prop ] ) .",
    "however , it provides a natural setting to introduce a class of boundary conditions that are of central importance to this work , and may also provide a more intuitive description of the tfim to readers with a probabilistic background than the definition given in section  [ intro_sec ] .    before proceeding we introduce some notation .",
