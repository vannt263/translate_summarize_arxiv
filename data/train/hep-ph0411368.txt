    "in a model based on supersymmetry ( susy ) , slepton mixing is a source of lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) .",
    "two types of effective lfv couplings are induced at low energies ; i.e. , those mediated by the neutral gauge bosons and those by the neutral higgs bosons .",
    "in contrast to the gauge boson mediation , the contributions from the higgs - mediation do not decouple even if the soft susy breaking scale is as large as @xmath6 tev  @xcite . to study the higgs - mediated lfv couplings the tau - associated processes are useful because they are proportional to the mass of the relevant charged leptons .",
    "the lfv couplings associated with a tau lepton have been measured at @xmath7 factories by searches for rare tau decays , such as @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc . at future collider experiments ,",
    "they are directly tested via the decays of the higgs bosons ( @xmath12 ) , @xmath13  @xcite .    in this talk , we discuss a reaction at the deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) region with high - intensity and high - energy muon beams as an alternative approach of searching for the lfv couplings associated with a tau lepton . here , @xmath14 is a target nucleon , and @xmath15 represents all final state particles .",
    "sher and turan have discussed this process in a model independent approach  @xcite . instead , we here consider this process in the framework of susy  @xcite .",
    "when the scalar lfv coupling of @xmath16 is independent of the other types of couplings , its experimental constraint comes from the @xmath17 result . the total cross section of the process mediated by the scalar lfv coupling",
    "could then be as large as 0.5 fb at muon energy ( @xmath0 ) of 50 gev .",
    "for this case , with @xmath3 muons per year on a @xmath4 g/@xmath18 target mass , about @xmath19 of the events can be produced , or no observation of the signal would improve the limits by six orders of magnitude  @xcite .     dis process , assuming the effective scalar and pseudo - scalar couplings  @xcite and the mssm higgs coupling constrained from the current data  @xcite .",

    ", width=241 ]    in the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , the higgs boson couplings are related each other . in the decoupling region ( @xmath20 gev ) , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 , the scalar coupling @xmath23 is nearly equal to the pseudo - scalar coupling @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , both couplings are determined by the more constrained one , namely the pseudo - scalar coupling  @xcite .",
    "it is constrained by the @xmath25 decay ( @xmath26 )  @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tot ] , the total cross sections are shown for the cases of the effective scalar and pseudo - scalar couplings as well as the susy model with the maximal value for the couplings under the current data of the rare tau decays .",
    "the largest values of @xmath27 and @xmath28 can be realized with @xmath29 tev and the higgsino mass @xmath30 tev .",
    "it should be noted that in such a situation , the gauge boson mediated couplings are strongly suppressed .    we evaluate the cross sections of the reaction in the dis region for the higgs - mediated interaction with the maximally allowed values of the effective couplings for each quark contribution : see fig.[fig : total - cross - section - vs - emu ] .",
    "the cross section sharply increases above @xmath31 gev .",
    "this enhancement comes from a consequence of the @xmath1-quark contribution in addition to the @xmath32 and @xmath33-quark contributions .",
    "the cross section is enhanced by one order of magnitude when the muon energy changes from 50 gev to 100 gev .",
    "typically , for @xmath34 gev and @xmath35 gev , the cross section is @xmath36 fb and @xmath37 fb , respectively .",
    "dis process as a function of the muon energy for the higgs mediated interaction .",
    "it is assumed that the initial muons are purely left - handed .",
    "cteq6l is used for the pdf .",
    ", width=226 ]    next , we study cases where the gauge - boson mediation is dominant ; i.e. , @xmath38 gev . since br@xmath39  @xcite , the contribution from the tensor interaction is found to be smaller than that from the higgs boson mediation by about five orders of magnitude . on the other hand ,",
    "the vector and axial - vector interactions are suppressed at the same level as the pseudo - scalar interaction  @xcite .",
    "therefore , their contributions can be as large as those for the higgs boson mediation , if @xmath40 is less than 50 gev  @xcite . at higher energies , the cross section for the gauge boson mediation becomes much smaller than that for the higgs boson mediation because of no enhancement by the @xmath1-quark sub - process .",
    "[ fig : angle - dependence ]",
    "with the intensity of @xmath3 muons per year and the target mass of 100 g/@xmath18 , about @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) events could be expected for @xmath43 fb , which corresponds to @xmath44 @xmath45 gev from fig .  [ fig : total - cross - section - vs - emu ] .",
    "this would provide good potential to improve the sensitivity by four ( two ) orders of magnitude from the present limit from @xmath46 decay , respectively .",
    "such a muon intensity could be available at a future muon collider and a neutrino factory .    in the higgs boson mediated interaction ,",
    "the tau leptons are emitted at a relatively large angle with respect to the beam direction .",
    "this is in contrast to the gauge mediated interaction where the tau leptons are forward - peaked . in fig .",
    "[ fig : angle - dependence ] , the @xmath47 dependence in the differential cross section is shown for each @xmath48 at @xmath0 = 50 and 100 gev .    to identify the tau lepton from the reaction , direct measurement of tau lepton tracks ( such as by emulsions )",
    "might not be possible at such a high beam rate .",
    "instead , the identification might be possible by tagging the tau decay products and observing their decay kinematics . among various decay modes",
    ", one might consider leptonic decays of the tau leptons .",
    "another candidate could be to detect a hadron from the two - body tau decays .",
    "the branching ratios , such as @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 , are about 0.3 in total . in particular , in susy models with left - handed slepton mixing , the @xmath52(@xmath53 ) produced through the higgs - mediated interaction is only right - handed ( left - handed ) for an incident left - handed @xmath54 beam ( right - handed @xmath55 beam ) .",
    "the hadrons from the right - handed @xmath52 decay ( left - handed @xmath53 decay ) tend to be emitted in the direction of the parent tau lepton , and therefore be rather energetic .",
    "therefore , the signature of the events could be a hard hadron at a relatively large angle from the beam direction ( namely a hadron with large transverse momentum @xmath56 ) and some missing energy .",
    "those hadrons from the tau decay should be discriminated from the hadrons from the target nucleons which have mostly soft energies .",
    "this process can be useful to search for the higgs - boson mediated lfv coupling , especially when @xmath40 is higher than 50 gev .",
    "there , the contributions from the sea @xmath1-quarks become significant , and the cross section is drastically enhanced ."
