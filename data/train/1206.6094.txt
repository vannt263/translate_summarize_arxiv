    "near - contact binaries are very important source in understanding the formation and evolution of the binary systems .",
    "the members of these systems have orbital periods less than 1 day .",
    "most of the systems contain a component at or near its roche lobe .",
    "theoretical studies suggest that the near - contact binaries could be in the intermediate - stage between a detached or semi - detached configuration ( e.g. @xcite )",
    ". therefore , these systems are important observational targets which could play a key role in understanding the evolutionary stages of interacting binaries .",
    "krcyg ( hd333645 , @xmath1 ) was recognized as a variable star by @xcite .",
    "its properties are relatively poorly known compared to those of other short - period binaries .",
    "the observations of @xcite revealed the first photoelectric light curves and a period of @xmath2 for the system .",
    "@xcite included krcyg in their list of near - contact eclipsing binaries .",
    "its more detailed history until 2004 has been described by @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , no spectroscopic study exists .",
    "we followed the observations of the system and obtained new light curves in 2005 .",
    "we report the new photometric observations , and the solutions of the light curves . in this paper",
    ", we investigate possible implications of the orbital period change of the system based on our new minima times , and on historical data collected from the literature .",
    "both the period analysis and the light - curve analysis show that krcyg is probably a triple system .",
    "the system is important not only because it joins the group of near - contact binary systems @xcite , but also because we show that it is part of a triple system with @xmath076 @xmath3 orbit and a mass function of @xmath4 .",
    "the observations were acquired with a high - speed three channel photometer attached to the 48 cm cassegrain telescope at ege university observatory .",
    "the observations were continued in ubvr bands .",
    "some basic parameters of the program stars are listed in table 1 .",
    "the names of the stars are listed in the first and second columns , while j2000 coordinates are listed in the third and fourth columns .",
    "the v magnitudes are in the next column , and the spectral types of the stars are listed in the last column . although the variable and comparison stars are very close on the sky , differential atmospheric extinction corrections were applied .",
    "the atmospheric extinction coefficients were obtained from observations of the comparison stars on each night . moreover ,",
    "the comparison stars were observed with the standard stars in their vicinity and the reduced differential magnitudes , in the sense variable minus comparison , were transformed to the standard system using procedures out - lined by @xcite .",
    "the standard stars are used from the catalogues of @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the dereddened colours of the system were computed .",
    "heliocentric corrections were also applied to the times of the observations . to compute the standard deviations of observations",
    ", we used the standard deviations of the reduced differential magnitudes in the sense comparisons minus check stars for each night . in figure 1 , the light and colour curves of krcyg are shown .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we obtained new ubvr observations for krcyg and analysed the ubvr light curves to reveal a orbital parameters solution including its roche configuration .",
    "a detailed analysis of the orbital period changes of krcyg was made using its @xmath5 diagram constructed from all available times of eclipse minima .",
    "the findings from this study are summarized as follows :    \\(i ) new physical and geometrical parameters of components of the system have been derived .",
    "orbital parameters indicate that krcyg is a near - contact binary system with a large temperature difference of approximately 5230 k.    \\(ii ) krcyg is a semi - detached binary system , in which the primary ( massive and hotter ) component is slightly smaller than its roche lobe , while the cool component is slightly greater than it . it exhibits a @xmath6 lyrae type light curve , and fulfils most of the properties of the near - contact systems @xcite .",
    "\\(iii ) the system can be classified as near - contact binaries of fo vir type .",
    "however , it must be noted that the existing observational material does not allow a precise classification for the system .",
    "\\(iv ) @xmath5 analysis indicates that krcyg is probably an interesting triple eclipsing system showing the slow ltte caused by a third body orbiting with a period of @xmath076 years .",
    "furthermore , the significant contribution of the third - body found in the light curve analysis .",
    "thus , it confirms that third body may produce the sinusoidal variation in the @xmath5 residuals .",
    "\\(v ) in future work , spectroscopic observations should be made to obtain radial velocity curves , which will allow a better discussion of the absolute dimensions and the evolutionary status of krcyg .",
    "new timings of this eclipsing binary are also necessary to improve the ltte parameters derived in this paper .",
    "the author acknowledge generous allotments of observing time at the ege university observatory .",
