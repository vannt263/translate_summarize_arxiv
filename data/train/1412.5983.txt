    "while the ultraviolet divergences in maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory @xcite are well known @xcite the case of maximal supergravity @xcite remains an open question .",
    "explicit calculations for the four - graviton amplitude diagram in four dimensions ( @xmath4 , four external states ) have reached four loops @xcite , up until which point the theory remains finite under the same conditions on the dimension as for super - yang  mills theory .",
    "investigations through more general methods @xcite on the other hand , are not conclusive on what conditions will hold for maximal supergravity",
    ". some studies point at a first possible divergence at seven loops in four dimensions , for the 4-point amplitude @xcite .",
    "in fact , a scenario with maximal supergravity as finite in four dimensions would be slightly confusing , as the theory then would present a well - defined quantum theory , possible to treat perturbatively without any alteration . string theory or m - theory",
    "is expected to present its ultraviolet completion , and the general discussion ( in short ) concerns at what loop order the theory diverges .    in this",
    ", a few investigations using the pure spinor formalism @xcite have been performed .",
    "the advantage of the formalism is that it makes it possible to keep the maximal supersymmetry manifest off - shell : there exist actions for both maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory and maximal supergravity . as such , desired simplifications",
    "might be expected to occur . of the studies",
    "previously mentioned , the first ones were initiated by berkovits @xcite and later partly extended by bjrnsson and green @xcite .",
    "they are performed from a string theory point of view , with the examinations of the amplitudes chiefly taking place in maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory , before the results are generalised to maximal supergravity . as a result , the maximal supersymmetry is not manifestly present throughout the examinations , though the end result is characterised by it .",
    "our previous paper @xcite instead started out from the supergravity action , constructing a field theory description for the amplitudes . in this way",
    ", the description could benefit from manifest , maximal supersymmetry throughout the examination .",
    "the results of @xcite were in accordance with those obtained by the previous investigations using pure spinors .",
    "the predicted limits for uv finiteness were in agreement with each other , as were the limitations of the evaluation methods .",
    "however , we have since approached the subject in a more detailed manner , the result which is the subject of this article .",
    "our findings are peculiar . in the @xmath1-ghost .",
    "it is possible that contributions from these nonzero modes will modify our conclusions , and we are currently investigating this .",
    "we thank nathan berkovits for pointing this out . ]",
    "we argue that the previous investigations using pure spinors have not taken the full loop regularisation into account , not as far as is necessary , which is why we no longer can provide results in unison with what is known from the explicit calculations for the four - graviton amplitudes : our method is not predictive enough , and we can only state that the 4-point amplitude is finite in three dimensions , and possibly for higher dimensions as well .",
    "our previous conclusion that something new might be expected to occur at five loops ( if ever ) does not necessarily hold . either algebraic relations not yet discerned by us occur already at two loops , or at different stages at and above two loops .    to begin with , we take a closer look at the loop regularisation introduced in order to allow for loop momenta to exist in the amplitude description , while retaining the possibility to perform examinations of the behaviour of the amplitudes .",
    "the most important finding is that the operators in the loop structures can not provide @xmath5 ( i.e. @xmath0 to its degrees of freedom ) in maximally supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory , nor @xmath0 ( of @xmath6 degrees of freedom ) to any higher power than @xmath7 in maximal supergravity .",
    "this affects how far the loop regularisation must be performed ( to a greater extent than previously assumed ) .",
    "another key feature related to the loop integrations is the presence of total derivatives ( i.e. vanishing terms ) .",
    "secondly , we have reformulated the @xmath1-ghost to simplify the analysis of how terms in the amplitudes can combine in order to satisfy the loop integrations brought on by the loop regularisation , while creating the divergences in the ultraviolet regime .",
    "the most intriguing observation is that the amplitudes behave no worse than at seven loops , and the 4-point amplitude no worse than at six loops , as one - particle irreducible loop structures above those limits can not be formed . in a worst case scenario , in combination with the results of @xcite",
    ", this would mean that the theory of maximal supergravity in four dimensions diverges merely logarithmically .",
    "the article is organised as follows .",
    "we begin by giving a brief recapture of the essential concepts of the field theory description of the amplitudes in the pure spinor formalism , and refer to @xcite for a detailed description ( or @xcite in a briefer format ) . here , we use the case of maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory to illustrate the principles , as yang ",
    "mills provides a well - known theory and its field theory description is far more concise than what is true for supergravity .",
    "the limits on the dimension for finiteness in yang  mills theory may be observed in .",
    "we then proceed to the properties of the loop regularisation in relation to the divergences with respect to small @xmath8 and the subsequent recognition of extra degrees of freedom of @xmath0 .",
    "this occurs at an earlier stage than previously assumed , due to an effective limit on the power of @xmath0 below its degrees of freedom , discussed in connection to .",
    "finally , we proceed to the case of maximal supergravity . here , a new shape of the @xmath1-ghost , better fitted for calculations than the one in @xcite , is presented .",
    "we analyse the basic principles for how the components in the @xmath1-ghost and the operators in the vertices can combine to satisfy the loop integrations while furnishing the ultraviolet divergences . for a definite statement on the uv divergences though",
    ", further examinations are necessary .",
    "perhaps manifest u - duality is required , or properties not yet recognised play a vital rle in the cancellation of certain terms .",
    "the requirement of @xmath9 for 4-point one - particle irreducible loop structures is discussed prior to and the general requirement of @xmath10 concerning the @xmath11-point ( @xmath12 ) equivalents around .",
    "effectively , we observe a cut - off of the behaviour of the amplitudes at ( six ) seven loops .",
    "this occurs naturally for supersymmetric yang ",
    "mills theory in the sense that the limit on ( whole ) dimensions does not alter past six loops , but has interesting implications for supergravity .",
    "the properties of the amplitude diagrams in @xmath13 , @xmath14 supersymmetric yang  mills theory and @xmath15 , @xmath14 supergravity are , in a field theory approach in the pure spinor formalism , set by the actions@xcite :    [ eqs.actions ] @xmath16 { \\operatorname{tr}}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}\\psi q\\psi+\\frac{1}{3}\\psi^3\\bigg)\\label{eq.sym},\\\\ s_{sugra}&\\sim\\int[\\mathrm{d}z]{\\operatorname{tr}}\\bigg(\\frac{1}{2}\\psi q\\psi+\\frac{1}{6}({\\lambda}{\\gamma}_{ab}{\\lambda})\\big(1-\\frac{3}{2}t\\psi\\big)\\psi r^a\\psi r^b\\psi\\bigg).\\label{eq.sugra}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    each is characterised by manifest , maximal supersymmetry and reminiscent of a chern  simons action , with @xmath17 being a brst operator and @xmath18 the pure spinor superfield .",
    "the first part represents the abelian action , whereas the latter describes the interactions .",
    "as can be noted , only 3-point vertices exist in the yang  mills theory , whereas supergravity also contains 4-point vertices .",
    "in addition , there exists operators connected to the vertices in supergravity , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , which by necessity act out of the vertices on different legs , the different configurations of which are equivalent . in yang ",
    "mills theory , the only truly relevant operator in the description , apart from @xmath17 , is the propagator .      the actions in originate in an observation of the properties of the abelian theories :",
    "the covariant spinor derivative @xmath21 acting on the 1-form @xmath22 ( yang  mills theory ) and the 3-form @xmath23 ( supergravity ) , each containing the physical fields of the theories , represent the equations of motion , contingent upon certain irreducible representations being removed .",
    "these properties are captured in full @xcite by a construction @xcite with the bosonic spinor @xmath24 ( of ghost number one ) contracted with the indices of the derivative and physical fields , provided the spinor is pure : @xmath25 that is , @xmath26 with @xmath27 etc .",
    "gives the equations of motion , with @xmath28 in addition , the components of @xmath18 remain untouched until subject to the equation of motion , which allows for off - shell degrees of freedom and an extension of the theory so that @xmath18 contains more fields ( of non - zero ghost number ) than @xmath29 : antifields etc . in this way ,",
    "the necessary components for a formulation with an action are introduced , while the original , free theory remains retainable at ghost number zero in @xmath18 .    moreover , shows @xmath17 to be a brst operator , and the description above that of a brst formulation , with a natural extension to a theory of interactions in the batalin ",
    "vilkovisky formalism @xcite .",
    "in essence , the symmetry operator @xmath17 is replaced with a generalised action acting on fields nonlinearly through an antibracket , the only available option ( as it is not desirable to split @xmath18 into fields and antifields ) being @xcite @xmath30,\\ ] ] resulting in a formulation with the equation of motion @xmath31 .",
    "the action is obtainable through the master equation @xmath32 , with a starting point in the brst action ( the first parts of ) for consistency .",
    "however , for a full description of the theories , further characteristics of the pure spinor formalism are of vital importance : brst equivalence , gauge fixing , the concept of integration and that of general regularisations .",
    "firstly , brst equivalence ( @xmath17-equivalence ) represents a freedom of the formalism caused the fact that any calculation is performed between on - shell , external states .",
    "consequently , any term is only defined up to brst equivalent terms : @xmath33 @xmath34 being a fermion of appropriate ghost number and dimension .",
    "so called regulators , @xmath35 , can be introduced at any time .",
    "secondly , gauge fixing can not be performed in the conventional way for the same reason as mentioned in connection to the antibracket .",
    "instead , gauge fixing in string theory is imitated through a siegel gauge @xcite resulting in a propagator @xmath36 where the @xmath1-ghost obeys @xmath37 and automatically should have the property of @xmath38 .",
    "thirdly , to obtain an integral measure which captures the full dynamics , the superspace is typically extended @xcite to contain two extra variables @xmath39 , counterparts to @xmath40 obeying @xmath41 , with @xmath42 of ghost number @xmath43 . in this non - minimal formalism",
    "is denoted by @xmath44 and shows up in the gauge invariant ( @xmath45 modulo @xmath46 , @xmath47 any 1-form ) configurations of @xmath48 , @xmath49 @xcite .",

    "] of @xmath8 otherwise would cause divergences with respect to small @xmath8 .",
    "this can always be avoided through the introduction of new sets of variables and corresponding regulators and integral measures @xcite .",
    "the procedure has a definite drawback though : it renders examinations of the remaining expressions severely difficult .",
    "effectively , it is not strictly put to use , though vital as a concept . however , at the introduction of loops the unregularised propagator is too local to allow for loop momenta of @xmath8 . the current , string theory inspired solution to this problem , the loop regularisation @xcite ,",
    "consists of recognising the momenta of the loop(s ) as variables , in effect @xmath69 for each derivative on a propagator making up a part of the loop(s ) @xmath70 , and allowing for an integration over the loop momenta .",
    "the procedure comes with the introduction of a regulator with exponent : @xmath71 the propagator regularised in this way is not too local for loop integrations , while examinations of the amplitudes can be performed .",
    "the latter however includes the consideration of a conversion of the variables in the operators present in the loop(s ) , when acted on by .",

    "a general amplitude diagram may be divided into the following parts : external fields , tree diagrams and loop clusters , the last term denoting one - particle irreducible sets of loop diagrams .",
    "the ultraviolet behaviour of an amplitude is no worse than that of the most badly behaved loop cluster in it , which is why the focus of these examinations is on loop clusters of @xmath74 loops , connected to other diagram parts through @xmath75 outer legs .",
    "moreover , for the purpose of discerning the uv divergences in maximally supersymmetric yang  mills theory and maximal supergravity , it is sufficient to consider diagrams constructed out of 3-point vertices , a fact that will become apparent in  [ par.msugra ] .",
    "in addition , it can be shown and  [ par.csd ] discuss this in more detail with respect to the pure spinor formalism . ] that any loop must have at least four outer legs : there are no bubbles or triangles @xcite .",

    "the different loop configurations are disregarded , but included in the general analysis",

    "the main points concern @xmath17-equivalence , total derivatives and loop momenta claimed by the loop integrations .",

    "otherwise , the derivative in some way acts on another component : derivative , variable or across a vertex , i.e. out of the loop .",
    "the consequences of the two observations above are more far - reaching than perhaps assumed at a fist glance . the fact that @xmath38 prohibits two full @xmath1-ghost to remain in a loop has implications in combination with the loop integrations , which claim derivatives and make use of the loop regulator , bringing down other derivatives and variables .",

    "any @xmath44 not forced to act on something , possibly out , is added to the @xmath44:s brought down by the loop integration , and represents a total derivative at the loop integration : a vanishing expression .",
    "in addition , since @xmath38 only forces one derivative in @xmath1 out of a loop ( as that @xmath1 acts across a vertex ) , splitting the @xmath1 , only @xmath102:s contain @xmath44 ( maximum one ) with a non - zero result .",
    "the @xmath158:s on the other hand effectively act into different loops ( with respect to @xmath44 ) . for the outer vertices ,",
