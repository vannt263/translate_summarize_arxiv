    "the higgs sector of the standard model ( sm ) can be extended by additional higgs multiplets . in models with additional isospin @xmath8-doublets , 2 neutral and a pair of charged higgs bosons for each additional doublet",
    "are newly included as physical higgs bosons .",
    "then , searches for the higgs bosons and measurements of their properties are indispensable for understanding the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking and also physics beyond the sm .",
    "the decay of a higgs boson into another higgs boson is worthwhile to study , because we can observe two kinds of higgs bosons simultaneously .",
    "it is also important in the study of strategies for the detection of higgs bosons .",
    "however , this type of decay is hard to occur in the decoupling region of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) because quartic coupling constants in the higgs potential whose linear combination is related to the mass difference among heavy higgs bosons are restricted to the electroweak gauge coupling constants @xmath9 and @xmath10 . on the other hand , in the general extended higgs sector , such as the thdm , this type of decays can be allowed within some constraints . therefore , to study the decay of a higgs boson into another higgs boson may bring us a opportunity to distinguish between the mssm and such a model  @xcite as well as to affect detection strategy for higgs bosons .    in this talk",
    ", we concentrate on the decay of a heavy neutral higgs boson into a charged higgs boson in the thdm . for production of heavy neutral higgs bosons ,",
    "a photon collider can be an ideal device where neutral higgs bosons are produced in the @xmath11-channel via loops of charged particles .",
    "its reach for the mass of higgs bosons is about @xmath12 of the parent @xmath13 collider .",
    "even if the charged higgs bosons can not be detected at the lhc , and even if the charged higgs bosons are too heavy to be detected in other charged higgs boson production processes at the lc  @xcite , it may be possible to detect them in this decay of neutral higgs bosons at a photon collider .",
    "we consider the thdm model with a ( softly broken ) discrete symmetry under the transformation @xmath14 and @xmath15 , where @xmath16 are the higgs isodoublets with hypercharge @xmath17 .",
    "the higgs potential at the tree level is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 to @xmath22 are real .",
    "since we consider the case of no cp violation in the higgs sector , @xmath23 and @xmath24 are also real though they are generally complex .",
    "the potential has its minimum at @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) .",
    "the 8 parameters in the potential can transform into the masses of the higgs bosons , @xmath27,@xmath28,@xmath29 and @xmath30 , the mixing angles @xmath31 and @xmath32 , the vacuum expectation value @xmath33 , and the soft - breaking scale of the discrete symmetry @xmath34 . using these physical parameters ,",
    "the quartic coupling constants @xmath35 can be written as @xmath36",
    "in the thdm including the mssm , the processes @xmath2 are loop - induced processes , which consist of the triangle - type and box - type diagrams in the leading order .",
    "the triangle diagrams lead to the @xmath11-channel exchanges of neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "since the quark contributions in loops tend to cancel between the triangle - type and box - type diagrams in the case insensitive to the @xmath11-channel higgs resonance  @xcite , the resonant @xmath38 production process can dominate around the resonance . in this talk , we consider the case where the peaked energy distribution of @xmath0 collision is adjusted to mass of a neutral higgs boson followed by decay into a charged higgs boson and a @xmath39 boson .    from eqs .",
    "( [ lam4 ] ) and ( [ lam5 ] ) we see that the mass splitting between the cp - odd higgs boson @xmath40 and the charged higgs boson @xmath41 is determined by @xmath22 and @xmath24 only : @xmath42 let us consider the @xmath40 resonant production followed by the decay into @xmath41 and @xmath43 in the thdm .",
    "it is notable that , in the mssm , @xmath44 and @xmath45 lead to @xmath46 which can not induce the resonant @xmath40 production in the @xmath2 processes .",
    "the vertex which induces the @xmath40 decay into @xmath41 and @xmath43 at the tree level can be written as @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the momentum of @xmath40 and @xmath41 in the in - coming directions to the vertex .",
    "the helicity amplitude for the process @xmath50 where we sum over the helicities of the out - going @xmath39 boson is given by the multiplication of the higgs-@xmath0 vertex function @xmath51 , the higgs propagator @xmath52 and the decay part @xmath53 : @xmath54 each part can be written as @xmath55 where @xmath21 and @xmath56 denote the helicities of the colliding photons . @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the @xmath0 collision energy and the total decay width of @xmath40 , and the functions @xmath59 can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite . @xmath60 and @xmath61 are the energy and the velocity of the @xmath39 boson in the center - of - mass frame of @xmath0 collision , respectively .",
    "the cross section for arbitrary initial photon helicities is given by @xmath62 .",
    "the cross section for the process is evaluated by convoluting with the @xmath0 luminosity ; @xmath63 where we use the @xmath0 luminosity derived from the tree - level formula of the backward compton scattering  @xcite for @xmath64 assuming complete polarization for laser photons ( @xmath65 ) and @xmath66 polarization for electrons ( @xmath67 ) . in our numerical evaluation ,",
    "the center - of - mass energy of a parent @xmath13 collider @xmath68 is assumed to be @xmath1 gev and @xmath7 gev which is the maximum value possible to reach at @xmath69 gev .",
    "[ rhopunivs ] shows the allowed values of @xmath30 and @xmath28 from various constraints , for @xmath7 gev , @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",

    "while the magenta circles indicate the allowed values by the rho parameter measurement  @xcite , the allowed values by theoretical constraints ( the requirment of vacuum stability  @xcite and perturbative unitarity  @xcite at the tree level ) are shown by the turquoise crosses . as a result",
    ", we find that @xmath6 gev is allowed , and to assume @xmath74 in the numerical evalution is reasonable .",

    "the parameters used for evaluating each case are listed in table  [ parameters ] .",
    "the @xmath72 values allowed by the above constraints are dependent on @xmath28 . in the numerical evalution , the relevant values of @xmath72 between @xmath73 to @xmath29 are used .",
    "the dependence of the cross sections on the choices of the @xmath72 values is insignificantly small .    though the cross sections for the @xmath5 process are less than @xmath80 fb in the mssm  @xcite , the cross sections for the @xmath81 process amount to @xmath3 fb in general .",
    "such cross section values are comparable with the ones for other charged higgs boson production processes at a photon collider  @xcite . while for other processes the cross sections are too small for @xmath4 gev , @xmath3 fb can be expected in the @xmath81 process for @xmath6 gev .",
    "in the thdm , the decay of a higgs boson into another higgs boson can be allowed within experimental and theoretical constraints , though this type of decay is hard to occur in the decoupling region of the mssm . to study this type of decay",
    "may bring us an opportunity to distinguish between the mssm and such a model  @xcite , as well as to affect detection strategies for higgs bosons .",

    "it is important that such cross section values can be realized for @xmath6 gev where the values for other charged higgs boson production processes are too small .",
