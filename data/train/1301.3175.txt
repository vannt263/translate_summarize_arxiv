    "discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) interior penalty ( ip ) methods were introduced in the late 70 s for approximating elliptic problems .",
    "they were arising as a natural _ evolution _ or extension of nitsche s method @xcite , and were based on the observation that inter - element continuity could be attained by penalization ; in the same spirit dirichlet boundary conditions are weakly imposed for nitsche s method @xcite .",
    "the use , study and application of dg ip methods was abandoned for a while , probably due to the fact that they were never proven to be more advantageous or efficient than their conforming relatives .",
    "the lack of optimal and efficient solvers for the resulting linear systems , at that time , surely was also contributing to that situation .    however , over the last 10 - 15 years , there has been a considerable interest in the development and understanding of dg methods for elliptic problems ( see , for instance , @xcite and the references therein ) , partly due to the simplicity with which the dg methods handle non - matching grids and allow for the design of hp - refinement strategies .",
    "the ip and nitsche approaches have also found some new applications ; in the design of new conforming and non - conforming methods @xcite and as a way to deal with non - matching grids for domain decomposition @xcite .",
    "this has also motivated the interest in developing efficient solvers for dg methods .",
    "in particular , additive schwarz methods are considered and analyzed in @xcite .",
    "multigrid methods are studied in @xcite .",
    "two - level methods and multi - level methods are presented in  @xcite and other subspace correction methods are considered in @xcite .",
    "still the development of preconditioners for dg methods based on domain decomposition ( dd ) has been mostly limited to classical schwarz methods .",
    "research towards more sophisticated non - overlapping dd preconditioners , such as the bps ( _ bramble pasciak schatz _ ) , neuman - neuman , bddc , feti or feti - dp is now at its inception .",
    "non - overlapping dd methods typically refer to methods defined on a decomposition of a domain made up of a collection of mutually disjoint subdomains , generally called _",
    "substructures_. these family of methods are obviously well suited for parallel computations and furthermore , for several problems ( like problems with jump coefficients ) they offer some advantages over their relative overlapping methods , and have already proved their usefulness . roughly speaking , these methods are algorithms for preconditioning the schur complement with respect to the unknowns on the skeleton of the subdomain partition .",
    "they are generally referred _ substructuring preconditioners_.",
    "while the theory for the confoming case is now well established and understood for many problems @xcite , the discontinuous nature of the finite element spaces at the interface of the substructures ( in the case of nitsche - type methods ) or even within the skeleton of the domain partition , poses extra difficulties in the analysis which preclude from having a straight extension of such theory .",
    "mainly , unlike in the conforming case , the coupling of the unknowns along the interface does not allow for splitting the global bilinear form as a sum of local bilinear forms associated to the substructures ( see for instance @xcite and ( * ? ? ?",
    "* proposition 3.2 ) ) .",
    "moreover the discontinuity of the finite element space makes the use of standard @xmath2-norms in the analysis of the discrete harmonic functions difficult . for nitsche - type methods ,",
    "a new definition of discrete harmonic function has been introduced in @xcite together with some tools ( similar to those used in the analysis of mortar preconditioners ) that allow them to adapt and extend the general theory @xcite for substructuring preconditioners in two dimensions .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite the authors introduced and analyzed _ balancing domain with constrains _ bddc , neuman - neuman and feti - dp domain decomposition preconditioners for a first order nitsche type discretization of an elliptic problem with jumping coefficients . for the discretization ,",
    "a symmetric ip dg scheme is used ( only ) on the skeleton of the subdomain partition , while piecewise linear conforming approximation is used in the interior of the subdomains . in these works ,",
    "the authors prove quasi - optimality with respect to the mesh - size and optimality with respect to the jump in the coefficient .",
    "they also address the case of non - conforming meshes .",
    "more recently , several bddc preconditioners have been introduced and analyzed for some full dg discretizations @xcite , following a different path . in @xcite the authors consider the @xmath1-version of the preconditioner for an hibridized ip dg method @xcite , for which the unknown is defined directly on the skeleton of the partition .",
    "they prove cubic logarithmic growth on the polynomial degree but also show numerically that the results are not sharp .",
    "the ip dg and the ip - spectral dg methods for an elliptic problem with jumping coefficient are considered in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . in both",
    "works the approach for the analysis differs considerably from the one taken in @xcite and relies on suitable space decomposition of the global dg space ; using either nonconforming or conforming subspaces .",
    "this allow the authors to adapt the classical theories for analyzing the resulting bddc preconditioners .",
    "in this work , we focus on the original substructuring approach introduced in @xcite for conforming discretization of two dimensional problems and in @xcite for three dimensions ( see also @xcite for a detailed description ) . in the framework of non conforming domain decomposition methods ,",
    "this kind of preconditioner has been applied to the mortar method @xcite and to the three fields domain decomposition method @xcite , always considering the @xmath0-version of the methods . for spectral discretizations and the @xmath1 version of conforming approximations the preconditioner has been studied in @xcite . for @xmath0-@xmath1 conforming discretizations of two dimensional problems the bps preconditioner",
    "is studied in @xcite .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , this preconditioner has not been considered for nitsche or dg methods before .    here",
    ", we propose a bps ( bramble - pasciak - schatz ) preconditioner for an @xmath0-@xmath1 nitsche type discretization of elliptic problems . in our analysis",
    ", we use some of the tools introduced in @xcite , such as their definition of the discrete harmonic lifting that allows for defining the discrete steklov - poincar operator associated to the nitsche - type method .",
    "however , our construction of the preconditioners is guided by the definition of a suitable norm on the skeleton of the subdomain partition , that scales like an @xmath2-norm and captures the energy of the dg functions on the skeleton .",
    "this allow us to provide a much simpler analysis , proving quasi - optimality with respect to the mesh size and the polynomial degree for the proposed preconditioners .",
    "furthermore , we demonstrate that unlike what happens in the conforming case , to ensure quasi - optimality of the preconditioners a block diagonal structure that de - couples completely the edge and vertex degrees of freedom on the skeleton is not possible ; this is due to the presence of the penalty term which is needed to deal with the discontinuity .",
    "we show however that the implementation of the preconditioner can be done efficiently and that it performs in agreement with the theory .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "the basic notation , functional setting and the description of the nitsche - type method are given in next section ; section  [ problem ] . some technical tools required in the construction and analysis of the proposed preconditioners",
    "are revised in section  [ sec : technical_tool ] .",
    "the substructuring preconditioner is introduced and analyzed in section  [ sec : substr ] .",
    "its practical implementation together with some variants of the preconditioner are discussed in section  [ sec : variants ] .",
    "the theory is verified through several numerical experiments presented in section  [ sec : expes ] .",
    "the proofs of some technical lemmas used in our analysis are reported in the appendix [ app0 ] .",
    "in this section , we introduce the basic notation , the functional setting and the nitsche discretization .    to ease the presentation we restrict ourselves to the following model problem .",
