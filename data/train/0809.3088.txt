    "large - scale alignments of quasar polarization vectors were first uncovered looking at a sample of 170 quasars selected from the literature ( hutsemkers 1998 , hereafter paper i ) .",
    "the presence of such alignments was confirmed later on a larger sample ( hutsemkers & lamy 2001 , hereafter paper ii ) .",
    "the departure from random orientations was found at significance levels small enough to merit further investigation .",
    "moreover , these alignments seemed to come from high redshift regions , implying that the underlying mechanism might cover physical distances of gigaparsecs .",
    "a large survey of linear polarization was then started , with the goal to characterize better the polarization properties of quasars and to investigate the reality of the alignments . a final sample of 355 quasars with reliable polarization measurements",
    "was then built on the basis of the new polarization measurements and of a comprehensive compilation from the literature .",
    "a detailed analysis of this sample was carried out by hutsemkers et al .",
    "( 2005 , hereafter paper iii ) .",
    "the main results are reviewed here and a possible interpretation based on photon - pseudoscalar mixing is presented .",
    "+     +    the sample under study contains 355 polarized quasars up to redshifts @xmath1 and with optical polarization position angles ( @xmath2 ) reasonably well determined ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it contains various types of bright quasars : radio - quiet and radio - loud , with or without broad absorption lines , etc .",
    "as far as possible , blazars were excluded due to their variable polarizations and unsecure redshifts . to minimize contamination by interstellar polarization , only objects with polarization degrees @xmath4 and located at high ( @xmath5 ) galactic latitudes were considered .",
    "alignments of quasar polarization vectors are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapn ] which shows maps of polarization vectors at low ( @xmath6 ) and high ( @xmath7 ) redshifts .",
    "we immediately see that the polarization vectors are not randomly oriented as one would expect .",
    "circular statistics indicates that the departures from a uniform distribution are statistically significant , and that the polarization angles of low- and high - redshift objects cluster around significantly different directions .",
    "the sources cover a huge region of the sky , typically 1@xmath8gpc at @xmath9 .",
    "statistical tests based on the nearest - neighbour analysis were applied to the full sample of 355 quasars .",
    "they indicate that the quasar polarization vectors are not randomly distributed over the sky with a probability in excess of 99.9% ( paper iii ; jain et al .",
    "coherent orientations are best detected in groups of 30 - 40 objects which correspond to the regions of alignments seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : mapn ] .    possible contamination of the data by intrumental and interstellar polarization was carefully inspected .",
    "instrumental polarization was measured to be very small .",
    "furthermore , quasar polarization data obtained at different observatories with different instruments do agree within the uncertainties . at high galactic latitudes",
    "the interstellar polarization is typically @xmath10 but can occasionally be higher .",
    "although we adopt the cutoff @xmath4 on the polarization degree to make sure that most of the measured polarization is intrinsic to the quasars , the polarization of the objects in our sample is usually lower than 2% ( fig .  [ fig : mapn ] ) so that at least some data might be affected by interstellar polarization .",
    "several tests and simulations were then performed in paper iii , as well as in sluse et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and cabanac et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , leading to the conclusion that it is very unlikely that interstellar polarization can be at the origin of the observed alignments .",
    "this is basically what we can also conclude from fig .",
    "[ fig : mapn ] : should interstellar polarization ( or any local contamination ) be responsible for the observed alignments , one would expect the same effect at all redshifts and no significant difference between mean polarization angles at low and high redshifts .",
    "to summarize , current observations show that quasar polarization vectors appear coherently oriented or aligned over huge ( 1 gpc ) regions of the sky located at both low ( @xmath11 ) and high ( @xmath12 ) redshifts and characterized by different preferred directions of the quasar polarization . looking in more details , there seems to exist a regular alternance along the line of sight of regions of randomly oriented and aligned polarization vectors , the mean polarization angle apparently rotating with the redshift ( paper iii ) . interestingly enough , the alignment effect seems to be prominent along an axis not far from preferred directions tentatively identified in the cosmic microwave background ( ralston & jain 2004 ) .",
    "alignments can be simulated for a group of quasars polarized at @xmath13 by adding a small systematic polarization ( @xmath14 ) to their intrinsic polarization vectors , assumed to be initially randomly oriented .",
    "this systematic polarization , which can be generated along the line of sight , can not be too high since existing correlations between polarization and other morphological or spectral properties of quasars ( e.g.  lamy & hutsemkers 2004 , borguet et al .",
    "2008 , and references therein ) can not be washed out .    although various interpretations might be possible ( paper i ",
    "iii ; see also morales & sez 2007 , demiaski & doroshkevich 2007 , campanelli et al .",
    "2007 ) , the dichroism and birefringence due to photon - pseudoscalar mixing within a magnetic field can modify the polarization of quasar light during its propagation in a way that qualitatively reproduces the observations ( jain et al .",
    "2002 , das et al .",
    "2005 , gnedin et al .",
    "2007 , piotrovich et al .",
    "2008 , payez et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "[ fig : mix ] illustrates the effect of photon - pseudoscalar mixing , within an external magnetic field , on the light from a distant quasar ( cf .",
    "payez et al .",
    "2008 for details ) .",
    "a small additional polarization which oscillates with the distance is created , such that an alternance of regions of random and aligned polarization vectors can be reproduced .",
    "the wavelength dependence of the effect ( e.g. payez et al .",
    "2008 ) could explain why such alignments are not detected at radio - wavelengths ( joshi et al .",
    "2007 ) . while the adopted magnetic field strength is lower than current upper limits for a cosmological magnetic field ,",
    "a huge coherence scale is needed .",
    "also , fine tuning is necessary to produce an oscillation with the observed periodicity . while an interpretation in terms of photon - pseudoscalar mixing seems promising , more realistic simulations are needed , such as a study of the cumulative effect of a succession of smaller regions with randomly oriented magnetic fields .",
    "interestingly , an apparently generic effect of photon - pseudoscalar mixing is the creation of circular polarization with @xmath15 ( fig .",
