    "since its experimental discovery in 2004  @xcite and first observations of unusual properties ,  @xcite graphene has gained a lot of experimental and theoretical attraction . in the last decade ,",
    "thousands of articles devoted to the study of graphene have appeared .",
    "possessing novel electro - mechanical properties , graphene is a promising material for electronic devices .",
    "the linear dirac - type electron spectrum makes graphene very interesting from the theoretical point of view and many interesting effects have been predicted and observed .",
    "castro    however , still there are open questions on fundamental electronic properties of graphene , and one of the most interesting ones concerns a possibility of superconductivity .",
    "graphene is a good conductor unless the fermi energy is too close to the dirac points and the electron - phonon coupling in graphene is not very weak .",
    "therefore , although the superconductivity in graphene has not been observed , it is not clear why one should discard the possibility of this phenomenon .",
    "superconductivity can be induced in graphene by superconducting contacts due to the proximity effect ,  @xcite but can it be obtained in a natural way \" ?",
    "what should one do in order to obtain a considerable value of the superconducting critical temperature @xmath0 ?",
    "what type of the superconductivity and what structure of the order parameter could one expect ?    in the last years , there have been various attempts to answer these questions . due to the special type of the spectrum",
    ", the main attention has been devoted to investigating the possibility of unusual types of the superconducting pairing .",
    "superconducting pairing mediated by conventional electron - phonon or electron - plasmon coupling  was considered in ref .",
    "[ ] with a conclusion that , in addition to the conventional @xmath3-wave pairing , an exotic @xmath4 state is possible .",
    "superconducting properties of dirac electrons in graphene were considered in ref .",
    "[ ] within the conventional bcs approach . in these publications",
    ", the main emphasis was put on the study of properties of unusual superconducting pairing for a small electron density .",
    "it is clear that one can expect very interesting new properties of the superconductivity in the vicinity of the dirac points .",
    "however , this region is least favorable for the existence of superconductivity due to the very low density of states , and one should tune the fermi energy away from the dirac points in order to have a hope to obtain superconductivity .    by doping graphene by various combinations of k and ca , the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] were able to shift the fermi energy far away the dirac points and even to put it in the vicinity of the van hove singularity  ( vhs ) .",
    "another experimental method based on the use of electrolytic gates efetov allowed the authors to tune continuously the electron density up to values @xmath5 , which is apparently not very far away from the vhs .",
    "these experimental works have demonstrated that one can achieve a ultrahigh electron density and this makes observation of superconductivity in graphene considerably more realistic . at the same time , transport measurements were not carried out in ref .  [ ] and the superconductivity has not been seen in ref .  [ ] for temperatures @xmath6 .    although the superconductivity has not been observed yet , theoretical considerations @xcite predict superconductivity at the vhs even for a repulsive electron - electron interaction . in this case , the superconductivity is expected to have an unconventional symmetry of the order parameter .",
    "no doubt , an experimental observation of the superconductivity at the vhs would be of a great interest , but one should be able to tune the fermi energy exactly to the singularity .",
    "disorder may also play a destructive role in formation of such a superconductivity .",
    "therefore , it would still be important to investigate theoretically the possibility of a superconducting pairing due to the conventional electron - phonon pairing far away from the dirac point , but , at the same time , not in the vicinity of the vhs .",
    "such a study implies using conventional schemes of computing the superconducting transition temperature .",
    "then , one should check the stability of the pairing against disorder in the system , clarify the dependence of the transition temperature @xmath0 , etc .    in several publications , models with an electron - phonon interaction have been considered .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "[ ] discussed the valley structure of the order parameter using an electron - phonon model without the electron - electron coulomb interaction .",
    "they argued that there might be a superconducting instability in highly doped graphene , while the valley structure depends on the parameters of the electron - phonon interaction .",
    "superconductivity in hydrogenized graphene ( graphane ) has been considered as well .",
    "@xcite in this system , a model based on electron - phonon interaction was used and a transition temperature of @xmath7 in p - doped graphane was predicted . at the same time , it is clear that taking into account the coulomb interaction is very important because it can in principle be even stronger than the electron - phonon interaction . moreover ,",
    "considering the latter in the weak coupling limit can also lead to incorrect predictions .    in this paper",
    ", we use a generic model including both the electron - phonon and electron - electron coulomb interactions . using eliashberg - type equations , eliashberg , morel , mcmillan we derive an expression for the transition temperature determined by the electron and phonon interactions in graphene . by using experimental values and results of numerical calculations for the interactions obtained for the normal state",
