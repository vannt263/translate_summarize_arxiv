    "phenomena involving positrons are important in many fields of physics , including astrophysics , plasma physics , atomic physics and materials science . in the laboratory ,",
    "low energy positrons are now being used for many of these applications , including study of electron - positron plasma phenomena  @xcite , atomic and molecular physics  @xcite , antihydrogen formation  @xcite , modeling of astrophysical processes  @xcite , and the characterization of materials  @xcite .",
    "the limitations in these studies are often due to the relative inavailability of suitable positron sources .",
    "methods to accumulate , cool and manipulate positron plasmas have been developed  @xcite and used in a recent experiment that created low energy antihydrogen atoms at cern  @xcite .",
    "long confinement times ( days ) , increased plasma densities and brightness enhancement are achieved with the rotating electric field technique  @xcite at temperatures of order 1 mev ( @xmath0 10 k ) . the apparatus presented in this article",
    "is designed to produce fluxes of slow positrons of order @xmath1 per second and be stored and/or cooled in a trap . in contrast , radioisotope sources currently in use produce fluxes @xmath2 .",
    "its size is also much smaller than that of a large linac or of a nuclear reactor but could be used as a small facility for interdisciplinary experimental studies with positrons .",
    "such a source would allow the production of positronium ( ps ) , hydrogen and antihydrogen in a symmetric way in the same experimental conditions through the set of reactions : @xmath3 , followed by @xmath4 or its antimatter counterpart @xmath5 and the production of ions via @xmath6 or @xmath7  @xcite .",
    "a novel method to produce a 3d image of molecules with a resolution of few ngstrms has been proposed  @xcite .    since several years",
    "the possibility to create a bose - einstein condensate ( bec ) of positronium and to make a 511 kev gamma ray laser is being studied  @xcite  @xcite .",
    "these techniques relie or would benefit a lot on the availability of a very intense source of positrons .",
    "moreover a high production rate of slow positrons ( exceeding @xmath8 ) and of positronium is being looked for in industrial and research applications , for instance , `` positron annihilation spectroscopy '' ( pas )  @xcite .",
    "the most commonly used source of positrons is @xmath9 .",
    "such compact sources are well suited for laboratory research , but their maximum activity lies around @xmath10 bq with a mean lifetime of 2.6 years .",
    "there are also some accelerators ( 100 mev ) partly used for the production of slow positrons which are managed as a facility and a nuclear research reactor in munich  @xcite .",
    "we propose an alternative intense ( @xmath11 ) source of slow ( mev ) positrons based on @xmath12 pair creation through the interaction of a 10 mev electron beam on a target with an intensity of a few ma .",
    "this source was designed to be coupled with a greaves - surko trap  @xcite in order to produce a bright beam of slow positrons ( mev to kev ) .",
    "it may also be used to produce positronium by applying the beam onto a cristal  @xcite .    the pair production cross section increases with energy .",
    "however the development of such a setup for university or industrial applications limits the beam energy to 10 mev because a higher energy would start to activate the environment ( legal limit ) .",
    "a dedicated facility would have a size comparable to that of a radioactive source but requires a special building for shielding .",
    "the positrons are produced by the interaction of a flat electron beam with a 50 microns target foil .",
    "the angle between the beam plane and the foil is very small , approximatively 3 degrees .",
    "the positron kinetic energy spectrum is peaked at 1.2 mev and extends to 8 mev .",
    "the first step in the positron capture by the trap is the moderation process .",
    "this process involves the slowing down of the positrons , the creation of meta - stable states with collective charge oscillations in the moderator and its re - emission at @xmath0 1.5 ev .",
    "the moderation efficiency decreases with the incident positron kinetic energy and is negligible at a few mev .",
    "therefore a magnetic collector was designed to separate the positrons from the electrons while preserving the positrons with a kinetic energy below 1 mev .",
    "an experimental test was performed with an electron gun used to weld metal pieces .",
    "the gun delivered a beam with a diameter around 5 mm , i.e. a surface of around 20 @xmath13  ( fig  [ fig : soudure1 ] ) .",
    "the 99.99% purity tungsten target we tested had a thickness of 50 @xmath14 m  @xcite , dimensions of 5 cm x 5 cm and was held with a piece of tungsten surrounding it on three of its sides .",
    "the accelerating voltage of the gun was fixed at 40 kv , the intensity was gradually increased until perforation at 20 ma .",
    "a 15 ma current does not perforate the target . at 40 kv electrons deposit all their energy in the metal .",
    "the target sustains thus a deposit greater than 2 kw/@xmath15 .",
    "however a 1 kw/@xmath15 limit is set on the deposited power as a safety margin .",
    "even if the temperature is kept well below the fusion point , there will be metal evaporation . using tables from langmuir and jones  @xcite , on the evaporation rate of tungsten filaments for light bulbs under the joule effect , the target would lose 10% of its mass in one hour at 3100 k , and 24 hours at 2700 k. a simple way of operation would then consist in exchanging the tungsten foil every night . running at 2700",
    "k means a lower electron intensity and thus a reduction in the @xmath16 rate of a factor 1.7 .",
    "simulations were performed with the geant 3.21  @xcite fortran library .",
    "electrons of 10 mev / c momentum were generated at an incidence angle of 3 or 90 degrees w.r.t the target plane .",
    "for the 3 degree incidence angle , the transverse shape of the beam is a rectangle of 1 mm x 20 mm thus illuminating a square area of 20 mm x 20 mm on the target .",
    "we have computed the energy deposited in targets of various thicknesses with a current of 1 ma ( figure  [ fig : courantmax ] ) . for 50 @xmath14 m at 3 degrees or 1 mm at 90 degrees , which have the same equivalent thickness  ) . ] , the deposited energy is respectively 1750 w and 4500 w. this difference is due to the fact that electrons have more possibilities to escape the target when the incidence angle is small .",
    "the total path length of an electron and its secondary electrons inside the target is on average 5 times longer at 90 degrees than at 3 degrees for the same equivalent thickness .    the deposited energy increases with equivalent thickness but saturates earlier with very low incidence angle .",
    "this allows to deliver a higher intensity for the same illuminated surface .",
    "figure  [ fig : courantmax ] shows the electron current intensity which corresponds to a deposited energy of 1 kw as a function of the equivalent thickness .",
    "the positron rate is given in figure  [ fig : prod ] .",
    "it is of the order of @xmath17 for 1ma electron current and equivalent thicknesses between 1 and 2 mm .",
    "these results agree with an independant similar study  @xcite .",
    "the rate of positrons produced with less than 1 mev of kinetic energy shown in figure  [ fig : prod ] is about 1/5 of the total rate .",
    "the limit on the deposited power at 1 kw/@xmath15 , determines the maximum current intensity per @xmath15 of target ( see figure  [ fig : courantmax ] ) .",
    "the corresponding positron rates are shown in figure  [ fig : ratepos-1kw ] .",
    "let us take the example of a 1 @xmath15 target of 50 micron thickness at an incidence of 3 degrees or 0.96 mm equivalent thickness .",
    "the deposited power for a 1 ma electron current is 1.75 kw ( resp .",
    "4.5 kw ) at 3 degrees ( resp .",
    "90 degrees ) .",
    "the maximum acceptable current for the limit of 1 kw/@xmath15 , as well as the corresponding positron rate for the maximum current are given in table  [ tab : tab1 ] .",
    "a system of production and collection of mev positrons has been presented .",
    "this setup uses pair creation from electrons hitting a thin tungsten target at a 3 degree incidence angle .",
    "the beam comes from a 10 mev/2.3 ma electron accelerator running in continuous mode .",
    "the setup allows to collect more than 5 @xmath19 positrons of less than 600 kev in a 2 cm radius aperture at 2 m from the target .",
    "the flux of electrons and photons reaching this aperture is of the order of 50 w.        the best electron source for this application is a rhodotron , which is commercialized by the iba  @xcite firm .",
    "this compact machine ( about 3 m in diameter ) is operated continuously all year long and can reach beam intensities up to 100 ma for food disinfection .",
    "several models are available according to the desired beam intensity",
    ". a 10 mev/2ma model would use 250 kw of power .    * acknowledgements *",
