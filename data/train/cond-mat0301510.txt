    "in recent years , there has been a surge of activity in the field of complex networks among statistical and interdisciplinary physicists  @xcite .",
    "quite naturally , various spin models of statistical mechanics have been studied on an underlying complex network  @xcite .",
    "these studies serve a twofold purposes : firstly , they aid studies of the static network structure . in many real - world situations ,",
    "the network structure is an underlying infrastructure for a dynamical system , and non - trivial effects can emerge from the interplay between the dynamical system and the network  @xcite .",
    "secondly , such studies of spins systems on complex networks can illuminate the properties of the spin - model itself in certain extreme situations .",
    "for example , both the ising and _ xy _ models can display a critical behavior similar to high dimensional regular lattices with a very low density of couplings ( or edges in the network ) between spins  @xcite .",
    "one of the most central complex network models is the watts and strogatz ( ws ) model of small - world networks  @xcite .",
    "briefly , this model is controlled by a parameter @xmath0 ( the `` rewiring probability '' ) , and by tuning @xmath0 from 0 to 1 one goes from regular to random networks .",
    "the interesting region is that of intermediate @xmath0 where the network is clustered ( has a high density of short circuits , or more specifically , triangles ) and a logarithmically increasing average path - length ( the path length of a pair of vertices is the smallest number of intervening edges ) . in the _ xy _ model , each vertex",
    "is associated with a two - dimensional spin - angle .",
    "model has mostly been used to study phase transitions in superconductors and superfluids , while it was also applied to e.g. , the formations of bird flocks  @xcite .",
    "the static properties of the _ xy _ model in the ws network have been studied in @xcite , where critical exponents characteristic of a mean - field transition have been found at any nonzero value of @xmath0 . in the present paper ,",
    "we study the _ dynamic critical behavior _ of the _ xy _ model on the ws small - world network with focus on the dynamic critical exponent .",
    "in the ws model for the small - world network  @xcite , a regular network is first constructed by arranging @xmath2 vertices in a one - dimensional circular topology and connecting each vertex to @xmath3 neighbors .",
    "then one goes through each edge one at a time , and with the rewiring probability @xmath0 detaches the far - side of the edge and reconnect it to a randomly chosen other vertex ( with the restriction that loops and multiple edges must not be formed ) .",
    "in this manner , a small - world network with the size @xmath2 is constructed with the model parameters @xmath4 and @xmath0 .",
    "this procedure is illustrated fig .",
    "[ fig : ws_col ] the former parameter ( @xmath4 ) is not believed to give any significant change of the network structure for @xmath5 , and thus we fix @xmath6 throughout the paper .",
    "the _ xy _ model consists of planar spins interacting through the hamiltonian @xmath7 where @xmath8 at vertex @xmath9 is the spin angle , corresponding to the phase of the superconducting order parameter in the ginzburg - landau theory of superconductivity .",
    "the coupling matrix @xmath10 is given by @xmath11 for example , in the _ xy _ model on a two - dimensional square lattice where only nearest vertices interact , we have @xmath12 except when @xmath9 and @xmath13 are nearest neighbors . for convenience",
    ", we measure the temperature @xmath14 in units of @xmath15 .",
    "to investigate the dynamic critical behavior of the _ xy _ model on the ws network we use the so - called `` short - time relaxation method '' , which utilizes the relaxation behavior of the system towards equilibrium from the a nonequilibrium initial state . by use of this method several critical exponents",
    "have been successfully determined for the ising model  @xcite , for unfrustrated and fully frustrated josephson junction arrays  @xcite , and for the classical heisenberg spin _",
    "_ model  @xcite .",
    "the major advantage of the short - time relaxation method ( compared to dynamical simulations in equilibrium ) is the running time saved from the avoidance of equilibration .",
    "the monte carlo ( mc ) scheme is based on the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hamiltonian ] ) and the standard metropolis local update algorithm  @xcite .",
    "the key quantity we measure is  @xcite @xmath16~,\\ ] ] where the time @xmath17 is measured in units of one mc sweep , @xmath18 is the average over different time sequences from the same starting configuration , and average over different network configurations , denoted by @xmath19 $ ] , should also be taken . here",
    "the sign function @xmath20 measures the sign ( @xmath21 ) of @xmath22 .",
    "the initial configuration is chosen as @xmath23 , giving @xmath24 , and @xmath25 since in equilibrium ( @xmath26 there is no preferred angle direction .",
    "we chose the trial angle @xmath27 ; the motivation is that it is sufficiently small in order to obtain good convergence rate of the quantity we measure while it is big enough to make simulations fast  @xcite .    in order to obtain the dynamic critical exponent and detect the phase transition",
    ", we use the finite - size scaling of the quantity @xmath28 .",
    "close to the critical temperature @xmath29 one expects that in a finite - sized system the characteristic time @xmath30 scales as @xmath31 , while the ratio of the correlation volume @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the scaling function with the property @xmath34 . at @xmath29 , where the second scaling variable vanishes , the dynamic exponent @xmath35 is easily determined from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) by the requirement that the @xmath36 curves obtained for different sizes of the networks collapse onto a single curve when plotted against the scaling variable @xmath37 .",
    "it is also possible to determine @xmath29 from eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) by applying an intersection method : starting from the fully phase ordered nonequilibrium state , @xmath28 decays from @xmath38 to @xmath39 as time proceeds . for times @xmath17",
    "where @xmath40 we can fix the parameter @xmath41 to a constant for given @xmath2 and @xmath35 . then @xmath28 has only one scaling variable @xmath42 and can thus be written as @xmath43 if now we plot @xmath28 with fixed @xmath44 as a function of @xmath14 for various @xmath2 , all curves should have a unique intersection point at @xmath45 .",
    "finally , we can check the consistency by using the full scaling form to collapse the data for different temperatures and networks sizes onto a single scaling curve in the variable @xmath42 at fixed @xmath41 .",
    "in addition , this is a consistency check of the value of the static exponent @xmath46 .    to discuss the finite - size scaling in more detail , the form eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) is based on the assumption that there is only two length scales in the system : the network size @xmath2 ( or the number of vertices in the network ) and the correlation volume @xmath47 diverging at @xmath29 . however , it is known that in the small - world network there is an additional spatial length scale related with the distance between shortcut endpoints , given by @xmath48  @xcite . accordingly",
    ", in the presence of the three competing scales ( @xmath2 , @xmath47 , and @xmath49 ) , the finite - size scaling function should take the form @xmath50",
    "@xcite . here",
    ", we aim to use sufficiently large systems with @xmath2 much larger than @xmath49 ( but , as we will see , this is difficult for small @xmath0 ) , where @xmath51 may be approximated as @xmath52 .",
    "this leads to the above mentioned scaling forms  ( [ eq : scaling ] ) and ( [ eq : scaling1 ] ) without @xmath49 .",
    "we exemplify the critical behavior of @xmath28 for ws model networks with @xmath53 .",
    "this value is quite representative for all @xmath0 values of our simulations , but ( as we will discuss later ) small @xmath0 requires larger system sizes , longer times series , and more averages .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaling ] shows the finite - size scaling of the short - time relaxation given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) which at @xmath29 turns into the simple form : @xmath54 with the only one scaling variable @xmath55 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] ( as well as all other @xmath0 and @xmath14 values ) we have performed a sample average over @xmath56 independent runs for @xmath57 different network realizations . instead of leaving both @xmath58 and @xmath29 as free parameters , we use @xmath29 obtained from static mc simulations  @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : scaling ] displays the best collapse onto a single curve in a broad range of the scaling variable @xmath37 with @xmath59 where the number in the parenthesis is the error in the last digit ( how @xmath58 is obtained is described in detail in the appendix )  @xcite .",
    "just as for static quantities  @xcite the obtained @xmath60 is consistent with higher dimensional regular lattices ( @xmath61 to be precise ) , where @xmath62 is expected  @xcite",
    ".    however , the above method presumes _ a priori _ knowledge of @xmath29 . to check out the consistency of determination of @xmath29 one",
    "can use an intersection method described above in sec .",
    "[ sec : short ] . in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] we display @xmath28 as a function of @xmath14 for different network sizes @xmath2 with a fixed value of @xmath63 in the first argument of the scaling form in eq .",
    "( [ eq : scaling ] ) .",
    "we find a unique crossing point at @xmath64 and @xmath65 . in some cases",
    "( typically for small @xmath0 values ) the @xmath29 has to be slightly altered ( from the values of ref .",
    "@xcite ) to get both the collapse and intersection plots of fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] correct .",
    "we then use @xmath35 and @xmath29 estimated as above to make the full scaling plot for @xmath28 as displayed in the main part of fig .",
    "[ fig : double ] .",
    "a very smooth collapse here is obtained with @xmath66 which is again consistent with ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the procedure described above for @xmath53 is then repeated for various values of @xmath0 to obtain fig .  [",
    "fig : z ] .",
    "as one can see , except for @xmath67 , @xmath68  @xcite throughout the broad range of @xmath0 .",
    "we believe that the nature of the transition ( and hence @xmath60 ) is independent of @xmath0 for all @xmath69 .",
    "the larger values of @xmath35 for small @xmath0 is a result of a failure of the assumption that we can neglect the length scale @xmath49 since @xmath70 can not be valid for small @xmath0 .",
    "the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : z ] displays the dependence of critical temperature @xmath29 ( obtained as discussed above ) upon @xmath0 and is consistent with what has been obtained from static mc  @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the dynamic critical behavior of the _ xy _ model on ws model networks by means of dynamic monte carlo simulations .",
    "we have used the short - time relaxation method , based on the relaxation from a nonequilibrium state , and determined the critical temperature @xmath29 , the dynamic critical exponent @xmath35 , as well as the static correlation - volume exponent @xmath46 .",
    "the dynamic critical exponent was determined to be @xmath71 for the networks with rewiring probability @xmath72 , while the static critical exponent was found to be @xmath73 .",
    "we believe that this result will hold for any @xmath69 but that the system size needed to confirm this diverges as @xmath74 .",
    "the exponent @xmath46 , as well as two others , critical exponents @xmath75 and @xmath76 of the specific heat and magnetization respectively have been obtained in ref .",
    "the obtained values @xmath77 , @xmath78 , and @xmath79 , which also have been shown to be independent from the value of @xmath0 , establish the mean - field nature of the transition in _ xy _ model on ws networks .",
    "the result of the present paper support this picture and since the upper dimensionality for the mean - field theory is @xmath80 , one can conclude that the phase transition in _ xy _ model on ws networks is in the same universality class as a regular lattice of dimensionality @xmath61 .",
    "an interesting observation is that for a regular hyper - cubic lattice this behavior requires a number of edges larger than @xmath81 , whereas for in our simulations we have much fewer ( @xmath82 ) edges ; and most probably @xmath83 ( giving @xmath84 edges ) gives the same behavior .",
    "we also note that there is no additional critical behavior _ induced _ by the ws model other than the transition from linear ( `` large - world '' ) to logarithmic ( small - world ) behavior in diameter as @xmath0 becomes finite .",
    "this work was partly supported by the swedish research council through contract no .",
    "2002 - 4135 . b.j.k .  was supported by the korea science and engineering foundation through grant no .",
    "r14 - 2002 - 062 - 01000 - 0 .",
    "this appendix concerns the estimation of @xmath35 from data collapses as illustrated in fig .  [",
    "fig : scaling ] .",
    "the problem we are faced with is that we are looking for a collapse over a large range of @xmath86 , and that the functional form of @xmath87 is not easily expressed on a closed form or in low degree series expansions . to get around this problem we partition the @xmath22-range in @xmath88 segments @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and fit a line ( @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) to the @xmath28 point - set within each segment ( cf .",
    ". then we sum the square of the deviations from the lines : @xmath93 where @xmath94 is the set of all numerical values of @xmath95 and thus depends on the value of @xmath96 chosen .",
    "( note that @xmath17 and hence @xmath22 are discrete variables . )",
    "now it is clear that if the segmentation can be done so that @xmath28 can be reasonably well approximated by the line segments @xmath91 , i.e. , if @xmath87 is smooth enough , then @xmath97 will converge to the correct value as the number of samples and @xmath88 are increased .",
    "the remaining consideration is how to choose the segmentation . in general",
    ", one needs the segments large enough to get a small error in the linear regression , and small enough for the line - segment approximation to be feasible . in practice",
    "the method seems to be rather insensitive for the partition method .",
    "we choose to partition the whole range of @xmath22 in segments of equal length , with @xmath98 .",
    "the minimization of @xmath99 is conveniently done by a newton - raphson method  @xcite .",
    "the error in @xmath85 is calculated by jackknife estimation  @xcite .",
