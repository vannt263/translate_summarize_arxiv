    "engineering electronic systems at the nanoscale is becoming a fascinating way to realize unconventional states of matter , ones that break the fermi liquid paradigm . some recent examples include several ways of realizing one - dimensional luttinger liquid physics  @xcite , gate - tunable molecules showing quantum phase transitions  @xcite , and tailored double quantum dots in semiconductors exhibiting complex behaviors such as multichannel kondo physics  @xcite .",
    "further progress and new classes of anomalous behavior can be realized by combining _ both _ fine - tuned nanostructures and tailored environments , as demonstrated by a series of recent experiments  @xcite involving quantum tunneling at the nanoscale in the presence of strong dissipation in the contacts . in this type of system ,",
    "single electron tunneling events create large electromagnetic fluctuations , that become energetically prohibitive in a strongly resistive circuit .",
    "this so - called dynamical coulomb blockade phenomenon leads to inelastic losses that can be quite effective in impeding low - energy electrons from transporting current , and so dramatically depress the conductance for small applied voltage bias across the device ( typically in a power - law fashion ) .",
    "this physical behavior is quite reminiscent of the problem of quantum tunneling in luttinger liquids , one - dimensional conducting wires where coulomb interaction effects are prominent  @xcite . in that case",
    ", power - law zero - bias anomalies in transport also arise due to excitations of collective plasmon modes .",
    "this analogy can be formally pushed to a general theoretical equivalence between the two problems using bosonization techniques  @xcite , which makes dissipative circuits an attractive method for probing local aspects of luttinger liquid physics in nanocircuits .",
    "recent experimental investigations further explored this analogy by extending previous single barrier devices to quantum dot systems  @xcite . here , additional quantum degrees of freedom are introduced , such as the quantized charge and magnetic moment for the localized electronic level .",
    "previous theoretical arguments  @xcite showed that the luttinger analogy is still maintained , opening an interesting playground for quantum critical and anomalous kondo - type behavior .    in the present paper ,",
    "we aim at analyzing in detail the transport characteristics in the simpler case when only the local electron charge is the relevant variable , as can be realized by a full spin - polarization of the electronic states in a large magnetic field .",
    "this situation results in complex signatures because zero bias anomalies are very sensitive to the typical transmission through the device .",
    "they can , for instance , be washed out when the transmission of the electron channel approaches unity .",
    "while the complete loss of dynamical coulomb blockade at perfect transmission is correct for single tunnel barriers , it turns out to be quite non - trivial in the case of resonant tunneling through a perfectly transmitting electronic level .",
    "we show here that full transmission does survive large dissipation in the contacts , but extra energy loss in the environment is still possible which then modifies the low - temperature behavior of the conductance .",
    "this behavior can be rationalized when the dissipation is fine - tuned such that the impedance is close to the quantum value @xmath0 ( here @xmath1 is planck s constant and @xmath2 the electron charge ) , where an exact mapping to resonant majorana levels can be achieved at low energy .",
    "losses in the circuit are then embodied in majorana interaction terms , that were discarded in previous theoretical studies  @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we show that these terms are not only large in magnitude for dissipative circuits , but even control the leading behavior of the conductance near the unitary limit . here , a striking behavior of the inelastic scattering rate_linear _ in temperature and voltage  is obtained , which we view as a hallmark of interacting majorana quantum criticality that was uncovered in recent experimental studies  @xcite .",
    "a further question that we wish to examine here is to what extent single barrier scaling applies to the quantum dot setup when the system deviates from the resonance condition .",
    "we show that corrections due to the majorana interaction term are in this case  and in contrast to the resonant case mentioned above  very rapidly suppressed at low temperature , typically as @xmath3 .",
    "this result vindicates the use of usual dynamical coulomb blockade theory in a more general way than previously thought .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ model ] we present our model of resonant tunneling with dissipation , and outline the connection to luttinger and majorana physics . in sec .",
    "[ transport ] , we present a general theory of transport formulated in the majorana language and provide a perturbative treatment of inelastic processes , leading to a detailed study of various transport scaling laws in sec .",
    "[ scaling ] .",
    "we present here the basic model for resonant tunneling through a single spin - polarized electronic level with resistive leads characterized by the dimensionless quantity @xmath4 , the ratio of the lead zero - frequency impedance @xmath5 to the resistance quantum @xmath0 . for simplicity , we drop spin indices .",
    "our starting hamiltonian reads @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the hamiltonian representing the dot with a single energy level @xmath8 ( tuned by the backgate voltage @xmath9 ) , and @xmath10 describes the electrons in the source ( s ) and drain ( d ) electrodes .",
    "tunneling between the dot and the leads with amplitudes @xmath11 is given by @xmath12 where the operators @xmath13 describe phase fluctuations of the tunneling amplitude between the dot and the s / d lead .",
    "these phase operators are canonically conjugate to the charge operators @xmath14 associated with the s / d junctions . here , we have adopted the standard treatment quantum tunneling in the presence of a dissipative environment @xcite , which is valid for electrons propagating much slower than the electromagnetic field @xcite .",
    "it is useful to transform to phase variables related to the total charge on the dot . to that end , we introduce @xcite two new phase operators , @xmath15 where @xmath16 in terms of the capacitances of the dot to the source / drain contacts , @xmath17 .",
    "the phase @xmath18 is the variable conjugate to the fluctuations of total charge on the dot @xmath19 and so couples to voltage fluctuations on the gate which controls the energy level of the dot .",

    "@xcite was negligible , @xmath25 .",
    "( the opposite limit of a strongly fluctuating gate coupled to a resonant level but with no dissipation in the leads was considered theoretically in refs.@xcite , and the combination of both types of dissipation was recently treated in ref.@xcite . )",
    "thus , only the _ relative _ phase difference between the two leads remains @xcite , and the tunneling hamiltonian becomes @xmath26    the last part of eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) is the hamiltonian of the environment , @xmath27 @xcite .",
    "the environmental modes are represented by harmonic oscillators controlled by inductances and capacitances such that the frequency of environmental modes are given by @xmath28 .",

    "the source and drain leads can be standardly reduced to two semi - infinite non - chiral one - dimensional free fermionic baths  @xcite . by an unfolding procedure ,",
    "one obtains two infinitely - propagating chiral fields  @xcite , which both couple to the dot at the origin @xmath30 .",
    "one can then bosonize the fermionic fields  @xcite as @xmath31 $ ] ( we neglect klein factors for simplicity as their role is unimportant here ) , where @xmath32 are the bosonic fields introduced to describe the electronic states in the leads , and @xmath33 is a short distance cutoff . defining the flavor field @xmath34 and charge field @xmath35 by @xmath36 one can rewrite the lead hamiltonian as @xmath37.\\ ] ] with @xmath38 the fermi velocity .",

    "combining these two fields together embodies a local tunneling process which is analogous to having effectively interacting leads as in a luttinger liquid .",
    "we thus combine the phase factors as    [ eq : defphifprime ] @xmath42    where @xmath43 and the new fields are scaled so that they are free fields away from the tunneling points .",
    "the action describing the tunneling in terms of the new phase variables then reads @xmath44 \\;.",
    "\\label{eq : lt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    because of the local nature of the tunneling hamiltonian , one can proceed with an integration over all phase modes away from the origin as well as of the environmental modes .",
    "this leads to an effective action for the combined leads and environment given by  @xcite @xmath45 with @xmath46 a matsubara frequency ( @xmath47 is temperature , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is an integer ) .",
    "it turns out that one obtains a very similar effective action by starting from a model of spinless resonant level coupled to luttinger liquids @xcite , with luttinger parameter @xmath50 ( @xmath51 for repulsive interactions ) .",
    "thus , in the absence of dissipation , @xmath52 , one recovers the correct limit of non - interacting fermions @xmath53 .      in this last step ,",
    "we concentrate on the special value @xmath54 , corresponding to a fine - tuned circuit impedance @xmath55 ( close to the experimental value of ref.@xcite ) , which admits making interesting analytical progress .",

    "electron waves in the contacts and environment fluctuations in the circuit are thus combined together in a non - trivial way into non - interacting ( free ) fermionic species .",

    "a remarkable feature of this effective hamiltonian is the presence of `` pairing '' terms , like @xmath66 , in contrast to the initial tunneling hamiltonian eq.([eq : htunnel ] ) where the number of fermions is conserved .",
    "the underlying reason for the appearance of these pairing terms is that current in the source - drain circuit is produced both by destroying an electron on the dot while moving it to the drain and by moving an electron from the source to the dot ; hence , @xmath67 ( the field describing the current ) couples to both @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "this structure motivates the introduction of a majorana description of the local electronic level , @xmath70 so that @xmath71 and @xmath72 obey @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , and @xmath76 .",
    "the effective tunneling hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hfinal ] ) then becomes @xmath77 with @xmath78 .",
    "a very special working point can be identified from hamiltonian  ( [ eq : hmajorana ] ) : @xmath79 and @xmath80 corresponding to symmetric tunneling amplitudes to source and drain and exactly on resonance . in that case",
    "the @xmath71 majorana mode does not hybridize to either the leads or the @xmath72 majorana level ; the latter is , however , tunnel coupled to the fermion bath .",

    "this leads to a majorana quantum critical state with fractional degeneracy ( the ground state entropy is then @xmath81 ) . in our case ,",
    "the interaction strength @xmath82 is , however , large and certainly can not be neglected .",
    "_ one purpose of the present paper is to investigate the consequences of this contact interaction  we will see that it strongly affects the quantum critical properties . _",

    "we now investigate in detail the conductance through the dot for @xmath54 , both at and away from the critical state , taking into account the majorana interaction term .",
