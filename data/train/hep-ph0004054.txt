    "for quite some time already , a number of investigators has been considering possibly nonzero strange matrix elements of non - strange particles , nucleons @xcite .",
    "such intriguing discussions received additional impetus from the experimental @xcite and theoretical investigations of the related problem , namely surprisingly small fraction of the nucleon spin carried by the quarks @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the intense research on nucleon strangeness continued into nineties up to the present day ; references @xcite are just some of the examples . more precisely , matrix elements in question are @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the nucleon state and @xmath5 is an operator containing strange ( @xmath6 ) quark fields bilinearly . in this section ,",
    "the integration over the three - space is understood in the matrix element .",
    "later , we will indicate the integration explicitly where needed .",
    "we will be concerned with @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is an arbitrary matrix in the spinor space .",
    "namely , although the _ valence _ component @xmath9 of the full nucleon state @xmath4 contains only @xmath10 and @xmath11 quarks , quark - antiquark fluctuations include the @xmath12 component , allowing @xmath13 even though the net strangeness of the nucleon state @xmath4 is of course zero",
    ". some of these matrix elements may be surprisingly large , possibly pointing to some effects not expected in the naive quark model of hadrons .",
    "_ e.g. _ , the strange scalar density inside the nucleon is connected with the experimentally measured @xmath14 sigma - term through the ratio    @xmath15    for example , see @xcite-@xcite,@xcite . a review @xcite containing discussions of a very complete set of original references , estimates @xmath16 . also , emc experiment @xcite provides evidence that @xmath17 is possibly relatively large .    in the study of the long - debated issue of nucleon strangeness ,",
    "the usage of nucleon models is still important .",
    "this of course rises the question of the model dependence  even concerning the results on what is the basic mechanism behind the effect .",
    "for example , an analysis of steininger and weise @xcite of the scalar strangeness of the nucleon performed in the framework of the nambu jona - lasinio ( njl ) model , obtained a very small upper bound on the scalar strangeness from the njl model with four - momentum cutoff , a larger but still modest upper bound on it from the njl model with a three - momentum cutoff , but dramatically higher scalar strangeness arises when instanton - induced interaction among quarks dominates . in addition , these authors found only a small contribution , less than @xmath18 , from kaon loops . on the other hand , kaon loops are the basic mechanism for generating the nucleon strangeness in some other approaches ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite and refs . in sec . 2.1 in @xcite , or discussion in forkel _",
    "other examples are provided by the strangeness electric mean - square radius , the sign of which is positive according to @xcite , but negative in some other approaches @xcite , or the strangeness nucleon magnetic form factor , for which predictions of various models and analyses range from + 0.37 @xcite over positive @xcite to various negative values @xcite all the way down to possibly @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "this illustrates the motivation to investigate such issues further , in as large number of different approaches as possible , attempting to decrypt what is the physics behind model dependence . in the present paper",
    ", we formulate a framework which will in principle enable comparison of such results @xcite with corresponding results in a wider range of complementary models .",
    "we also want to propose a framework which will be applicable not only to the scalar strangeness , but more generally .",
    "below , we will give an expression for @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes normal ordering with respect to the non - perturbative vacuum @xmath22 : @xmath23 @xmath8 is an arbitrary matrix in the spinor space , say @xmath24 depending on whether one is interested in the scalar , pseudoscalar , vector , axial , and for some purposes maybe even tensor , pseudotensor , _ etc .",

    "that matrix elements @xmath27 can be significantly different from zero , is not very surprising in nonperturbative qcd in the light of its non - vanishing quark scalar condensates  the _ finite _ vacuum expectation value @xmath28 , but where the normal ordering is with respect to the _ perturbative _ vacuum , so that it does not vanish in the nonperturbative vacuum .",
    "we reserve the notation @xmath21 for the normal ordering with respect to the non - perturbative qcd vacuum .",
    "] of @xmath29 is actually approximately as large as for the non - strange quarks : @xmath30 .",
    "the mit bag model provides a good illustration how this leads to a large @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "however , there may also be @xmath0-pairs other than those from the qcd vacuum condensate , so that normal - ordered strange operators can in principle also have non - vanishing nucleon matrix elements .",
    "[ probe ] illustrates how a non - vanishing value of not only @xmath32 , but also @xmath33 , can then get a contribution from these @xmath0-pairs not from the vacuum condensate : at the instant @xmath34 the composite nucleon is hit by an external probe ( _ e.g. _ , a neutrino @xcite ) with the coupling @xmath8 to the strange quarks . due to an interaction capable of producing @xmath0-fluctuations",
    ", the nucleon state @xmath4 at the time - slice @xmath34 obviously contains not only the valence quarks @xmath35 , but also the @xmath6quark loop to which the external probe can also couple .",
    "( denoted by @xmath36 ) , _ i.e. _ to a probe coupled to strange quarks through @xmath8 .",
    "more precisely , this graph is that part of the nucleon response which arises only through one interaction @xmath37.[probe ] ]    let us _ schematically _ write down the full nucleon ( proton ) state which is also coupled to the strangeness - sensitive probe : @xmath38 where @xmath39 ( starting from @xmath40 standing for the complicated non - perturbative qcd vacuum ) symbolizes any number of various perturbative _ and _ non - perturbative gluon configurations but also any number of quark - antiquark pairs , including strange pairs which escaped detection by this probe",
    ". these complicated configurations  dress \" quarks ( @xmath41 ) into their effective counterparts  constituent quarks @xmath42 .",

    "@xmath45 can be viewed as the response of @xmath9 to the weakly coupled strangeness - sensitive probe .",
    "( the coefficients @xmath46 denote the amplitudes of states with various admixtures @xmath39 or @xmath47 .",
    "@xmath48 is the normalization . )",
    "this response makes possible that in principle the total nucleon @xmath8strangeness @xmath32 also receives a nonvanishing contribution from the non - vacuum channel @xmath33 .",
    "however , the question is how to get the nucleon state in specific enough terms in order to have a calculable expression for @xmath49 . to get it _",
    "exactly _ would probably be tantamount to solving nonperturbative qcd  consider , for example , that the fock state expansion itself must be built upon the nonperturbative qcd vacuum @xmath50 , which is unknown .",
    "this is why we said that ( [ fullproton ] ) is only a schematic , illustrative expression .",
    "therefore , one obviously has to rely on models to a large extent .",
    "one seemingly more viable approach could for example be to _ model _ @xmath51 in a conventional way in terms of _ only _ non - strange effective quarks ( so that @xmath52 even though @xmath53 at least for @xmath54 due to the strange vacuum condensate ) , and then use appropriate interactions @xmath37 to infect it by @xmath0-fluctuations and thereby produce @xmath45 - say , using perturbation theory if @xmath37 happens to be perturbative .",
    "this is what ( [ 1storder ] ) in the next section amounts to .",
    "however , in that section we also point out why one can not proceed quite so straightforwardly , and then give our alternative formulation with the formula for matrix elements of strange operators .",
    "how this expression can be evaluated is explained in more detail in the third section , where we also explain why we are motivated to investigate the case of the instanton - induced interaction .",
    "the evaluation of various strange densities  with this @xmath37 , and in a concrete nucleon model  is carried out in the fourth section .",
    "we conclude in the fifth section .",
    "as pointed out by forkel _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , the ( `` naive '' ) absence of virtual @xmath55 pairs in the hadron wave functions in the models based on constituent quark core , makes the treatment of nucleon strangeness in such models far from straightforward .",
    "since the approach presented below is complementary to other ones which have also used dressed quarks in some way ( _ e.g. _ , @xcite ) , we first give a review of some quark - model notions that will be relevant below .",
    "the purpose of working with hadron models is , of course , not to solve but to _ imitate _ the horrendously complicated non - perturbative low - energy qcd .",
    "accordingly , various gluon field configurations ( _ e.g. _ , instantons , or those configurations responsible for confinement ) and polarization clouds of fluctuating @xmath55 pairs ( all symbolized by @xmath56s in ( [ fullproton ] ) ) , as well as all interactions between all these fundamental constituents , are taken into account through parameters of some nucleon model and appropriate wave functions for dressed , _ effective _ quarks and antiquarks @xmath57 .",
    "examples may be various constituent quark models , where baryons consist just of valence quarks which are however _ constituent _ quarks , quasi - particles which come about through dressing of the current quarks by qcd  _ i.e. _ , in other words , by our @xmath39 s . or , it may be the mit bag model , where these long - range nonperturbative qcd effects lead to , or are partially parametrized by , a confining cavity containing again a fixed number of effective valence quarks ( and antiquarks , in the case of mesons and `` exotic '' @xmath58 baryons ) . choosing a definite model of the hadron structure implies also the choice of the model wave function basis @xmath59 in which to expand the quark fields @xmath60 ( @xmath61 ) in terms of creation ( @xmath62 ) and annihilation ( @xmath63 ) operators of dressed quarks and antiquarks .",
    "( @xmath64 stands for the set of quantum numbers labeling a model quark state . for the expansion specific to the mit bag - model see the appendix . )",
    "it is then clear , for example , that the nucleon @xmath65 ( when all three of these effective quarks are in their ground states ) , is nothing but our @xmath51 from ( [ fullproton ] ) except that all the mess of fluctuations @xmath39 is by some model parametrization lumped into dressing of valence quarks @xmath66 , as well as into effective model interactions , or a mean field they feel . obviously , the idea here is to represent hadrons as composed of a fixed , well - defined number of dressed valence quarks ( and antiquarks ) , bound by effective model interactions which sum up reasonably successfully the fundamental qcd ones .",
    "the most simplified , but illustrative case is when these model quasiparticles are moving in an average , mean field @xmath67 . to be sure , these model interactions ( and/or mean field ) , as well as the effective , dressed quarks @xmath68 , are assumed to be  produced \" by all relevant interactions between quarks at more fundamental levels _ including _ presently interesting strangeness - producing interactions @xmath37 . ",
    "produced \" here of course means that we _ modeled _ them , not  calculated \" from these underlying relevant interactions .",
    "so , they ( including @xmath37 ) are assumed to be accounted for through modeling .",
    "note , however , that this approach does not say what would be the model representation ( or parametrization ) of @xmath45 , as it does for @xmath69 . of course , in the spirit of all said above , we can write @xmath70 , and writing this is even quite useful for reminding us that _ i ) _ the fluctuating strange ( anti)quarks  being embedded in the nucleon  also have to be dressed in the way prescribed by whatever model is applied , including being in one of the model single - quark eigenstates , and that modeling effectively takes care of all their interactions ( except of course the interactions induced by their coupling at @xmath8 to their source , a probe sensitive to strangeness ) , and _",
    "ii ) _ , that all other fluctuations ( @xmath56s in ( [ fullproton ] ) ) are lumped in the dressing , so that the only allowed quark - antiquark fluctuation is @xmath71 , which has its source in the external strangeness - sensitive probe at @xmath8 .",
    "however , in contradistinction to , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xmath72 which is unambiguous because we know that there all quarks are in their model ground states ( and corresponding quantum numbers on @xmath66 are suppressed for brevity of the notation , but known in principle ) , @xmath70 is just a generic formula , a useful mnemonic as just described , because in this case we _ do not _ know in what states these five constituents are . in principle",
    ", @xmath45 is a superposition of all possible such states , encompassing exotic baryons with @xmath73 contents and ordinary strange baryons coexisting with kaons , as well as nucleons with @xmath0-mesons  most notably @xmath74-mesons .",
    "so , let us call @xmath75 the hamiltonian responsible for the formation of hadron states composed of definite , fixed numbers of quarks  and possibly antiquarks . in the simplest case , we can imagine @xmath76 as consisting of a sum of one - body quark operators , say typically of the effective quark kinetic energy operator @xmath64 and the mean , or self - consistent , field @xmath67 in which the dressed valence quarks would move . in any case , @xmath76 defines the nucleon model  possibly together with some other ingredients ( like the confining boundary condition in bag models , for example )",
    ". the valence nucleon state @xmath9 would then be the ground eigenstate , and @xmath77 would stand for all possible higher eigenstates of @xmath78 , @xmath79 for example , @xmath80 could be the static bag model hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath9 would then be the bag model nucleon in its ground state , and",
    "@xmath77 all higher bag states with a definite number of constituents , including also  bagged \" @xmath81 exotic baryons and the product meson - baryon bag states such as @xmath82 .",
    "what @xmath76 can not do is to produce @xmath83 fluctuating pairs . for",
    "that we have to invoke @xmath84 , or its corresponding hamiltonian @xmath85 , as by assumption they can produce @xmath83 excitations on top of @xmath9 . to clarify that introducing @xmath84 does not lead to double - counting ,",
    "let us repeat that @xmath76 is just a model hamiltonian , the parameters of which should mimic the effects of full , true non - perturbative qcd as much as possible . for example , if @xmath76 is the hamiltonian of the non - relativistic naive constituent quark model , it must contain the postulated mass parameter of the constituent quark mass @xmath86 .",
    "the corresponding quantity in the true theory , the dynamically generated quark mass , is ( in principle ) the result of all possible qcd interactions , so that the interactions related to @xmath87 can , in real qcd , also contribute to this mass by contributing to the @xmath0-fluctuations .",
    "the dynamically generated non - strange quark mass must be close to the model constituent quark mass parameter @xmath88 sitting in @xmath76 , and only in such implicit , indirect ways are interactions like @xmath87  present \" in @xmath76 .",
    "however , they are not present explicitly , and , in fact , @xmath76 can not produce any @xmath0 fluctuations at all .",
    "therefore , if we want to study the @xmath0 fluctuations , we must introduce @xmath87 to enrich the model nucleon with @xmath89-fluctuations on top of @xmath51 .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath84 ( and thus also @xmath85 ) contains strange quark field operators bilinearly so that it can connect @xmath9 and @xmath45 containing @xmath83 pairs .",
    "( this also implies @xmath90 regardless of what precisely this interaction is .",
    "this will be important in ( [ perth ] ) below , for the first - order shift @xmath91 and the third - order shift @xmath92 . ) in our figures , this interaction is depicted as a two - body operator , where a strange quark bilinear is combined with a non - strange bilinear .",
    "this may be , for example , the two - body part of @xmath93 , the instanton - induced interaction of shifman , vainshtein and zakharov @xcite , or its version used in @xcite . ] .",
    "on the other hand , steininger and weise @xcite studied the three - body part @xcite of instanton - induced interaction ( which part they call @xmath94 ) .",
    "nevertheless , the arguments here are completely general and encompass such cases too ; one would just have to do some obvious modifications in our figures .",
    "( for example , in figs",
    ". [ probe ] and [ klambda ] , such a @xmath84 would , in addition to the strange quark loop , straddle not just one but two valence quark lines of different flavours . )     to a strangeness source at @xmath8 through two interactions @xmath37 .",
    "this type of contribution can be associated with the kaon - loop contribution to the nucleon strangeness ( a possible @xmath95 intermediate state is therefore indicated ) .",
    "[ klambda ] ]    so , @xmath96 could be evaluated if @xmath45 could be found . but how ?",
    "for instance , it is easy to see that straightforward application of perturbation theory to find @xmath45 , where @xmath97 is hardly viable even in those cases when @xmath85 would be truly perturbative .",
    "namely , it necessitates the summation over intermediate states @xmath77 ( some of which must contain @xmath83-pairs , in order to give @xmath98 ) , which is very hard to handle in practice .",
    "admittedly , geiger and isgur @xcite have recently succeeded in performing such a straightforward perturbation calculation of the proton strangeness ( i.e. , using ( [ 1storder ] ) ) .",
    "however , in order to make their calculation tractable , they were forced to model hadrons as simple harmonic oscillators . also , the choice where to put a cutoff , i.e. which intermediate hadron states @xmath99 to discard , is more ambiguous than when working with quarks .",
    "fortunately , the alternative formulation through the evolution operator is also possible .",
    "we formulated and used it in ref .",
    "here we present a more detailed derivation of the expressions used there . more concretely",
    ", we will combine the feynman - hellmann theorem @xcite with the usage of the evolution operator containing the hamiltonian with the source of the strange current of interest .",
    "this is because in cases like this one , where we would like to avoid the need to construct @xmath45 explicitly , the method of sources is especially helpful .",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite , pages 89,90 . )",
    "of course , in this approach @xmath45 is the response of @xmath100 to the external probe which is the source of a strange current , and , naturally , we had this approach in mind already when we wrote schematically the full nucleon state coupled to a strangeness source as ( [ fullproton ] ) . this way we will not need @xmath45 explicitly . instead , we will obtain the nucleon matrix element of this current as the response ( to the current source ) of the _ transition amplitude _ of the model ground state @xmath100 at @xmath101 into itself , but at @xmath102 .",
    "we will use normal - ordered operators in order to get an expression for @xmath49 which can be non - vanishing due to the strange densities that may exist in the nucleon _ on top _ of the vacuum condensate densities that exist in the qcd vacuum .",
    "we are then in principle able to evaluate this matrix element because we assume we can represent the ground state @xmath100 by a known nucleon model .",
    "whatever we do below could be done also without normal ordering , but then the analogous expression would include the strangeness due to the strange condensate in the complicated qcd vacuum , and since we neither know the qcd vacuum state nor presently address its modeling , we can not evaluate this expression . how to find the vacuum part of nucleon strangeness , is an issue that depends on the relation of each specific hadron model with the qcd vacuum quark condensates .",
    "for example , this vacuum contribution to the scalar strangeness was found in the mit bag model by donoghue and nappi @xcite , while the expression for @xmath49 evaluated in our sec .",
    "4 , is the strangeness induced in the mit bag nucleon valence ground state in addition to the vacuum contribution .",
    "using the method of sources in combination with the model approach will also enable us to use the perturbative expansion of the evolution operator only formally ; since there are plausible physical arguments , which are _ different _ from the usual argument ( used in ref .",
    "@xcite ) of  smallness of the perturbation \" , that higher orders should be neglected , the resulting formula for strange nucleon matrix elements should be applicable even when the interactions @xmath37 , which lead to their non - vanishing values , is not really perturbative .",
    "these arguments are a novel element with respect to ref .",
    "namely , as already emphasized , the state used here as the ground state , @xmath100 , is fully determined by some model hamiltonian @xmath76 which also sums up the effects of @xmath37 in dressing of the constituent valence quarks , so that this interaction with strange quarks is not explicitly present  just as the strange quarks are not explicitly present in @xmath100 .",
    "however , @xmath37 is again _ induced _ by the external strangeness source , because it brings in a @xmath0 pair , which is not hidden in the modeled dressing polarization clouds ( @xmath39 s ) , and which must be absorbed via @xmath37 by the valence quarks so that the system is returned to @xmath100 .",
    "however , it turns out that a recognizable response within a defined nucleon model can be obtained only for a _ limited _ number of @xmath37-vertices , otherwise a double - counting occurs through dressing of already dressed quarks .",
    "all this will be explained more concretely below , after the derivation , which we present in more detail than in ref .",
    "@xcite so that the common points as well as differences with respect to geiger and isgur @xcite are clear .",
    "so , let us define another , auxiliary perturbation hamiltonian @xmath103 by adding to @xmath85 a source term for the strange operator we want to calculate in the  full \" nucleon state : @xmath104 where @xmath105 is the convenient abbreviation @xmath106 ( however , in all matrix elements @xmath107 above and below , the three - space integration over @xmath108 is understood ! ) the generic form @xmath109 can mean any of the cases @xmath110 the hamiltonians are normal ordered .",
    "it is usually implicitly understood , but , for clarity , we will indicate normal ordering explicitly everywhere in the remainder .    obviously , the feynman - hellmann theorem applied to our @xmath111 says that the sought strange matrix element of the full nucleon state is @xmath112 where we also took the physical limit of the vanishing strength ( @xmath113 ) of the external strangeness source .    since @xmath114 ,",

    "one can then easily understand how we can capture similar aspects of the physics of nucleon strangeness in our respective approach .",
    "now , how do we expect to render the strangeness in ( [ derlamb ] ) calculable , when ( [ perth ] ) contains sums over intermediate states , and , as pointed out above , handling them is precisely the difficulty that makes the conventional perturbative approach ( as in ( [ 1storder ] ) ) useless in practice ?",

    "[ u10 ] ]    first , let us remember that there are some perturbative interactions @xmath37 which can nevertheless be important for nucleon strangeness .",
    "one example is the depletion of the instanton density which occurs @xcite in the mit bag model , and which is so strong that in this case one can for sure treat the instanton - induced interactions perturbatively , using the density of very dilute instantons as the expansion parameter . in the light of results of @xcite which indicate that instanton - induced interactions may be an especially important source of strangeness , even such a perturbative contribution from instanton - induced interactions may well be significant .",
    "so , in some cases we can justify ignoring the contributions of @xmath158 , ( _ i.e _ , @xmath119 $ ] in ( [ perth ] ) ) as a perturbative approximation ) . ] .",
    "however , we are actually better off than that , because our model prediction for strangeness terminates with the @xmath152 contribution even for nonperturbative interactions @xmath37 , because it turns out that contributions from higher @xmath159 s would be double - counting .",
    "this follows from our view on nucleon strangeness as the response ( to a strangeness - sensitive probe ) of nucleon model states which , in the static regime ( before or after any interactions with external probes ) , are just @xmath51 , _",
    "i.e. _ , are by assumption built only of non - strange _ dressed _",
    "quarks @xmath160 , which hide all the complexity of qcd  including strange fluctuating pairs  in their ( modeled ) dressing .",
    "remember that except the interactions induced by the strangeness source , all fundamental interactions ( including @xmath37 ) and resulting fluctuations of gluon _ and _ quark fields are lumped in forming these effective quarks and their effective model interactions and/or mean field they feel .",
    "now , the contribution to ( [ formula ] ) from a @xmath161-differentiated term @xmath162 ( through ( [ eq : bezk ] ) ) would correspond to graphs with one vertex at @xmath8 from which two propagators of dressed strange quarks would emanate , two @xmath37-vertices which would receive them ( so it would be like in fig .",
    "[ klambda ] , from the @xmath161-differentiated @xmath152 contribution , so far ) , but then other @xmath163 @xmath37-vertices would follow .",
    "( _ e.g. _ , see fig .",
    "[ u10 ] . ) depending on how the contractions are arranged , they can be connected in the loop originating at @xmath8 , or can be disconnected from it , forming their separate loops . in both cases",
    "this is obviously double counting , as these additional @xmath163 vertices represent dressing of quarks that have already been dressed .",
    "the first two @xmath37-vertices are different , as they are induced by the strangeness source  they are the unavoidable sink for the @xmath0 pair created by the source at @xmath8 .",
    "the second term in ( [ formula ] ) , _ i.e. _ , the @xmath152 contribution , is the highest possible term that has just that , and does not contain additional interactions of the dressed strange loop with already dressed valence quarks , resulting in double - dressing . a completely equivalent , but probably even clearer way to see this is to view our external strangeness - sensitive probe as a _ sink _ ( instead of a source ) of a strange quark current .",
    "so , when this sink ( by means of interaction @xmath37 ) sucks a strange pair out of the polarization clouds that form our dressed valence quarks , this strange pair should go to this sink at @xmath8 that pulled it out  and _ not _ run all around the nucleon interacting with the valence quarks up to @xmath163 times ( @xmath164 ) , also altering in the process already defined model interactions between the valence quarks .    realizing this",
    "also automatically answers why there is no such contractions among the _",
    "non_strange quark fields which would lead to additional @xmath165 and @xmath166 pairs .",
    "such loops would also appear if contributions from higher @xmath159 could enter in ( [ formula ] ) .",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ u10 ] . ) _ i.e. _ , the avoidance of double - dressing gives the response of @xmath51 to a strangeness source in the generic form @xmath167 and not @xmath168 , _ etc .",

    "the field contractions in ( [ formula ] ) lead to the sums over stationary modes of single quarks and antiquarks , or , equivalently , the bound state propagators of these dressed model quarks .",
    "these sums require a regularization , but now , for the single quark modes , it is much easier to physically justify the choice of the cutoff than in the case of the sum over the exotic baryon and meson - baryon states like the one in ( [ 1storder ] ) or in ref .",
    "let us recall at this point that in the course of our derivation ( [ hprime])([eq : contractions ] ) , we replaced these summation over hadronic states by summation over the states / modes of quarks which constitute these hadrons .",

    "this cutoff on quark energies is dictated by the fact that nonperturbative interactions among quarks operate at low energies , whereas they gradually weaken and go over to the perturbative regime for higher energies .",
    "in the aforementioned study of @xmath170 effects of kaon loops @xcite , geiger and isgur have shown the importance of high - mass intermediate states in these loops . however , since these are hadronic , meson  baryon intermediate states , this does not contradict with cut - off such as @xmath171 gev on _ quark _ energies .",

    "@xmath84 can of course be any interaction which can produce fluctuating @xmath26 pairs , but the question is , which interactions can be important in producing the strangeness of the nucleon ?",
    "for example , perturbative qcd interactions should be relatively unimportant in this regard .",
    "although precisely the perturbative , high energy deep inelastic scattering reveals the sea of @xmath174 pairs , including @xmath26 , the contribution of this perturbative sea to the nucleon strange matrix elements has traditionally been judged as relatively unimportant  see , _",

    "a theoretical analysis @xcite of the ccfr data @xcite on strange quark distribution functions from neutrino - nucleon deep inelastic scattering , seems to further support this point of view .",

    "the possibly enhanced nucleon strangeness is thus expected ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) as an effect of nonperturbative qcd which , at low energies , around nucleon mass scale , is certainly more important for hadronic structure than perturbative qcd , and can lead to @xmath0 pairs already at small momentum transfers , _ i.e. _ , large distances .",
    "nonperturbative qcd is after all responsible for precisely such effects as forming quark - antiquark condensate @xmath177 @xmath178 and gluon condensate characterizing the nonperturbative qcd vacuum .",
    "some investigators ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref .",
    "@xcite , or , for a recent and comprehensive review , ref .",
    "@xcite ) have suggested that among the most important nonperturbative configurations of the gluon fields are instantons . by",
    "now it is certainly well - established that the effective interaction between quarks resulting from the presence of instantons ( let us call this interaction @xmath93 ) , plays a very important role in the formation of hadron structure @xcite although it is not responsible for confinement @xcite , as thought previously .",
    "( in the present approach , confinement must anyway be taken care of by the unperturbed hamiltonian @xmath76 . )",
    "this @xmath93 is therefore in our opinion worth testing as an important candidate for the interactions @xmath37 generating the strange nucleon matrix elements of some operators .",
    "a recent calculation @xcite in the context of njl model seems to be an indication that @xmath93 is indeed the most important part of @xmath37 , as it found large strange pair components in the nucleon only if instanton - induced interaction was included in the low - energy dynamics . in that case , the ratio @xmath179 ( [ y - ratio ] ) can be several times larger than its upper limit in the case when the `` standard '' njl model is used , even when augmented by kaon cloud effects @xcite .",

    "@xmath206 has in fact the form of a mass term , and can be thought of as the self - energy , or the effective mass that a quark acquires from the effective interaction caused by the instanton liquid through which quarks move in the nonperturbative qcd vacuum .",

    "so , if we take this viewpoint , why is ( [ formula ] ) applicable not only to parts of @xmath84 which come from perturbative interactions like the perturbative gluon exchange , but also to @xmath93 ( [ linst])([eq : l3 ] ) which is of nonperturbative origin , precisely wherefrom its importance derives in this low - energy context ?",
    "the point is that the _ origin _ of @xmath93 is nonperturbative , _ i.e. _ , these effective interactions between quarks are the consequence of nonperturbative gluon configurations  instantons",

    "the diluteness of the instanton liquid justifies the one - instanton approximation ( _ i.e. _ , the first order in the perturbation theory for @xmath93 ) indicated in fig .",
    "the second  order contributions to ( [ formula ] ) should be even smaller than the small first ",
    "order results on instanton  induced strangeness we obtained in the mit bag model .",
    "this removes the motivation for evaluating them , at least in the framework of that model . of course , in some other models , and possibly also with some other @xmath37 , the results on the nucleon strangeness it induces can be considerably higher , making the evaluation of the second  order contributions more interesting . as commented above , if one would find in different models that the second term in ( [ formula ] ) is small in comparison with the first term in ( [ formula ] ) , one would corroborate the result of @xcite that virtual kaon loops contribute little to the scalar strangeness . for the reasons explained above",
    ", this conclusion indeed seems natural in the present approach .",
    "more generally , our result ( [ formula ] ) may well help to clarify the relationship ( which , _",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite judges as rather unclear ) between the kaon loop contribution , and the @xmath74-meson pole contribution @xcite , or the vector - meson ( @xmath316 ) dominance contribution @xcite .",
    "namely , we believe that it will be possible ( for @xmath317 ) to relate the first term in ( [ formula ] ) to such @xmath74-meson contributions in a way similar to the relationship of the second term in ( [ formula ] ) with the kaon loop contribution .",
    "more recent evaluation @xcite based on the up - to - dated information on the ( soft ) nucleon - hyperon-@xmath318 form factors yields the results reduced by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "this brings the vector strangeness closer to our result ( [ vector0 ] ) , which is compatible with the recent measurements .",
    "the scalar strangeness is special because of non - vanishing scalar @xmath55 condensates of the qcd vacuum , which makes it more natural that it is larger than vector , axial or other strangeness channels .",
    "this is especially clear in our approach applied to the mit bag model , where the scalar strangeness comes mostly from the difference of the scalar @xmath55 condensates in the true qcd vacuum and their absence in the perturbative vacuum inside the cavity @xcite , while only the relatively small remainder comes from the response of the valence ground state to the strangeness ",
    "sensitive probe .",
    "however , such a response is all that exists in the case of the pseudoscalar , vector , axial , _ etc .",
    "_ , nucleon strangeness , since there are no pseudoscalar , vector , axial , _ etc .",
    "_ , qcd - vacuum condensates either inside or outside the cavity .",
    "since such responses tend to be much smaller than the nonperturbative vacuum contributions , significant differences in magnitude between the scalar and other kinds of strangeness are very natural in our approach .",
    "in fact , in the present case of the mit bag model , we find the vanishing first  order contribution to the vector strangeness . the vanishing first ",
    "order contributions are found also for the pseudoscalar and axial strangeness of the nucleon .",
    "this confirms the conjecture of ref .",

    ". the experimental strange magnetic form factor of the nucleon at @xmath320 ( gev / c)@xmath321 , @xmath322 , obtained at mit / bates @xcite is consistent with the absence of strange quarks , but the error bars are large .",
    "however , the results and conclusions of our approach , that channels other than the scalar one should not be appreciably affected by strange quarks , seems to get support especially from the most recent and very precise tjnaf ( jlab ) measurement @xcite yielding the small strange vector form factors at @xmath323 ( gev / c)@xmath321 , @xmath324    this also makes understandable why the results on the  non - scalar \" strange quantities such as the strangeness nucleon magnetic form factor @xcite or the strangeness electric mean - square radius @xcite vary so much , even by the sign , from one model to another : the  non - scalar \" strange quantities should all be rather small , and artifacts of various models very easily put in on either side of the zero .",
