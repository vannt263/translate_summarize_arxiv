    "applying a positive bias in our cell tends to drive negatively charged silica spheres upward into the bulk electrolyte .",
    "the field is uniform in our parallel plate geometry , so that the upward electrophoretic force on spheres of constant charge therefore should be independent of height @xmath22 in the cell . under such conditions",
    ", spheres dense enough to sediment under gravity should remain near the lower electrode at low biases , and should rise directly to the upper electrode at higher biases where electrohydrodynamics forces exceed gravity .",
    "this effect should be accentuated in charge - regulating silica spheres because the magnitude of their surface charge increases with ph , and therefore should increase with @xmath22 .",

    "particles repeated clump into dense clusters then burst out like fireworks . ]    unlike the previously reported interfacial crystals , which form for a wide variety of particle sizes and compositions , the rich panoply of patterns we have described arises appears only for particles meeting specific criteria of size and weight . to clarify this , we compared the electrokinetic pattern formation behavior in charge - stabilized dispersions of colloidal silica spheres , ps spheres and brominated ps spheres whose densities are 1.96 , 1.05 and 1.6  @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the surface charge densities of ps and brominated ps are similar and do not depend on the ph . both are more highly charged than the silica particles we have discussed so far .",
    "silica s charge density , moreover , varies with ph , with an isoelectric point at ph 2 .",
    "the behavior of 2.9  @xmath1diameter silica spheres is very similar to that of the 3.0  @xmath1diameter spheres we have discussed to this point .",
    "these also can form various bulk and low - floating patterns .",
    "substantially larger silica spheres never leave the lower electrode at biases below the threshold for bulk electroconvection .",
    "substantially smaller , lighter and more diffusive silica spheres create less well organized patterns . for example , 1.58  @xmath1silica particles usually only form unstable tumbling clouds at comparatively low biases before being pushed to the upper electrode at higher biases .    from previous studies @xcite ,",
    "it is known that electrokinetic interactions are weaker for smaller spheres .",
    "this would tend to reduce the forces binding patterns such as colloidal vortex rings together .",
    "the smaller spheres more vigorous diffusion also would tend to hinder the localized clusters formation .",
    "it also suggests a possible role for gravity , which can be highlighted by considering spheres comparable in size to the pattern - forming silica particles that are composed of different materials .    unlike silica spheres ,",
    "the nearly neutrally - buoyant ps spheres fail to form any bulk patterns at any accessible bias over the entire diameter range from 0.3  @xmath1to 7.0  @xmath1 .",
    "these highly charged spheres should have comparably strong electrokinetic interactions to their silica counterparts .",
    "their diffusivity also should be similar .",
    "their failure to form bulk patterns demonstrates that the gravity plays a central role in the pattern formation we have described , a conclusion consistent with the observation that no bulk patterns form at negative bias .",
    "dense brominated ps spheres 1.6  @xmath1 in diameter can form tumbling clouds similar to those formed by comparably sized silica spheres . whereas clouds of 1.58  @xmath1silica spheres tumble vigorously , however , clouds of brominated ps particles have no detectable internal convection . such quiescent itinerant clouds also appear for dispersions of 3  @xmath1silica spheres but only at much lower concentrations . in both cases ,",
    "each drifting cloud is about 50  @xmath1across and its constituent particles are separated by about 10  @xmath1 .",
    "stable clusters also do not form at very high or very low particle concentrations .",
    "dispersions at @xmath45 form chaotic clouds at low bias and jammed clusters at high bias .",
    "the absence of cyclic motion in low - concentration dispersions demonstrates that the flow patterns we have observed do not arise in the electrolyte alone under the relevant range of conditions , but rather require the spheres presence .",
    "the patterns concentration dependence further highlights the role of cooperative electrohydrodynamic interactions in establishing the distinct patterns .",
    "isolated particles behavior provides insights into these forces that help to clarify how such patterns form .",
    "to best highlight the role of collective behavior in electrohydrodynamic pattern formation , we studied the simplest case : a single silica sphere in an electrolysis cell . a single charged colloidal sphere of buoyant mass @xmath46 and charge @xmath47 in a constant electric field not only experiences a downward gravitational force @xmath48 and an electrostatic force @xmath49 but also more complicated electrohydrodynamic and osmotic forces due to the electrolyte s response to the field .",
    "when the lower electrode is negative , the positive screening cloud of the sphere flows downward .",
    "these flowing ions , including @xmath16and @xmath15created by hydrolysis , entrain a flow of water .",
    "the friction between this electrohydrodynamic flow and the sphere drags the sphere downward .",
    "the sphere s cloud of screening ions is deformed not only by the electric field , but also by the hydronium flux .",
    "this downward osmotic force and the downward electrohydrodynamic drag are second - order responses to the electric field , and therefore should be smaller than the electrostatic levitating force @xmath49 .",
    "straightforward considerations allow us to estimate the bias needed to levitate a particle against gravity . a single sphere sediments through water at speed @xmath50 , where @xmath51 is the density of water and @xmath52 is its viscosity .",
    "for 3  @xmath1diameter silica spheres , @xmath53 . the same particle s electrophoretic velocity saturates at @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is the electrolyte s debye - hckel screening length , and @xmath56 is the proton charge @xcite .",
    "if we choose the surface charge density @xmath57 @xcite and @xmath58 , these two velocity scales would be equal at about @xmath59 .",
    "thus , considering the neglected electrohydrodynamic and osmotic drags , the threshold for levitation should be at least 0.1   higher than the water decomposition voltage .",
    "this is consistent with our experiments .     on a sphere",
    "tracks variations in ph .",
    "( c ) the electric field @xmath60 is independent of height outside of the debye - hckel screening layers .",
    "( d ) even so , the charge - regulating spheres experience an upward force that increases with height in the cell .",
    "this force opposes the force due to gravity . ]    in fact , the ph is not uniform across the cell .",
    "[ fig : eqmg ] schematically shows how the profiles of ph , sphere charge @xmath47 , electric field @xmath60 , and electric force @xmath61 vary with height in the cell .",
    "even though the electric field is uniform in the bulk , the electrokinetic force levitating a charge - regulating silica sphere increases with height .",
    "when this force competes with gravity , therefore , it is possible to obtain two equilibrium heights , one near the lower electrode when gravity dominates , and another near the upper electrode where the electrokinetic force dominates .",
    "the situation is more complicated for two spheres because hydrodynamic forces between the spheres and bounding surfaces are long - ranged .",
    "reference  @xcite shows the numerically calculated streamlines for one or two electrophoretically levitated charged spheres .",
    "two particles sinking towards the lower electrode create a back flow which tends to drive them apart  @xcite .",
    "conversely , two electrically levitated particles will attract each other .",
    "this electrohydrodynamic interaction at least heuristically explains why an initially homogeneous colloidal fluid breaks up into discrete clusters as it is driven away from the lower electrode .",
    "we observed that the threshold for levitating a single sphere is lower than that for levitating an entire monolayer .",
    "this most likely reflects the reduced hydrodynamic drag coefficient for many spheres in a monolayer , as compared to that for a single sphere @xcite .",
    "the increased hydrodynamic attraction generated by the intensified ionic fluxes in the more concentrated dispersions would tend to draw these sedimented spheres together into clusters .",
    "this , however , tends to reduce their overall hydrodynamic drag  @xcite , causing them to rise less than they otherwise might have . to compare our system s behavior with these predictions",
    ", we performed experiments on 3  @xmath1diameter silica spheres from a monolayer with areal density below @xmath62 , _ i.e. _ fewer than three particles per frame . abruptly applying a bias causes these isolated spheres to jump off the lower electrode during the transient in which vertical ionic concentration gradients are established . below a threshold voltage",
    ", the particles eventually return to the lower wall . above this threshold",
    ", they rise to the top wall and remain suspended .",
    "[ fig : single ] shows how the single sphere s height changes with applied voltage as the voltage is first increased and then decreased .",
    "the point at which a single sphere is electrolevitated to the upper wall is hysteretic : levitated particles only return to the lower wall when the voltage is lowered substantially .",
    "the explanation for this hysteresis also can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : eqmg ] . at the critical bias , @xmath63 for all @xmath64 in the bulk .",
    "by contrast , a particle can only fall from the upper electrode , when the field falls below threshold at the upper electrode @xmath65 . therefore ,",
    "the two thresholds are different .",
    "the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : single ] shows this hysteresis more clearly at three different salt concentrations .",
    "such hysteresis supports the contention that the levitating force acting on silica spheres increases with the height @xmath22 .    for salt concentration above 1",
    ", a single particle can never be forced to the upper electrode .",
    "this is consistent with the observation that particles move less vigorously and cooperative structures are harder to form at high ionic concentrations .",

    "the voltage is increased and then decreased step by step .",
    "inset : the threshold voltage required to levitate spheres . ]",
    "attractions between particles are detectable only at relatively low particle concentrations ( _ e.g. _ @xmath66 ) and high applied voltages ( _ e.g. _ 2  ) . in such cases , particles attract each other as they levitate and so form tumbling clouds .",
    "the typical inter - particle separation in the most diffuse clouds is about 10  @xmath1and decreases with increasing bias .",
    "these field - induced attractions are surprisingly long - ranged , extending to roughly 50  @xmath1 . at biases above roughly 5  , even isolated spheres travel in circular orbits whose diameters range from 50 to 150  @xmath1 in the vertical plane .",
    "this motion is due to electroconvection in the underlying electrolyte .",
    "it almost certainly plays no role in forming the highly organized and substantially smaller - scale patterns discussed above .    generally speaking , single particles",
    "are not stably levitated into the bulk of the electrolyte , and they certainly do not trace out the complex trajectories characterizing microscopic patterns such as those in figs .  [",
    "fig : vortexring ] - [ fig : firework ] .",
    "these observations help to confirm that such patterns do not arise from electroconvection in the electrolyte alone .",
    "we are left to conclude that the spheres play an active role in dynamical pattern selection .",
    "we have demonstrated that many distinctive patterns reproducibly emerge from the interplay of gravity and electrohydrodynamic forces in charge - stabilized colloid . at biases above the threshold for hydrolysis but below the onset of electroconvection , only fluxes of @xmath15and @xmath16ions flow through the system .",
    "electroneutrality favors overlap of these fluxes ; however , `` friction '' between opposite flows is minimized if these flows are separated .",
    "the optimal balance between these effects separates the fluxes by a characteristic lengthscale comparable to the debye - hckel screening length , or roughly 0.1  @xmath1 .",
    "this is much smaller than the extent of the experimentally observed clusters whose diameters extend to roughly 100  @xmath1 .",
    "electroneutrality suppresses the formation of such large - scale convective structures in the absence of the charged spheres . in other words ,",
    "are not simply passive tracers for a pre - existing flow in the electrolyte , but rather they and their charges are essential for establishing the convective flows at the heart of the observed patterns .",
    "there are three general features about the dynamics of all clusters .",
    "( 1 ) they have the same circulating direction as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : schematic ] .",
    "( 2 ) the circulation speed increases with the bias as clusters tend to become more compact .",
    "( 3 ) the number of particles in each cluster increases with the bias .",
    "the bias - induced attraction of the second feature is crucial to understand the clusters formation .",
    "the breathing mode in figs .",
    "[ fig : oscillate ] and [ fig : firework ] may result from competition between this as - yet unexplained attraction and a combination of screened - coulomb repulsions and induced dipole repulsions among spheres .",
    "while the sequence of dynamical transitions from sedimented layer to tumbling clouds to highly organized clusters is reproducible , the crossover potentials depend sensitively on the changing electrochemical properties of the electrodes , and therefore can vary by as much as @xmath67 from run to run .",
    "we have reported a large family of previously unrecognized self - organized colloidal patterns that form in constant vertical electric fields at biases just above the decomposition voltage of water .",
    "our simple electrolysis cell gives rise to a complicated coupled system of hydrodynamic flows and ionic fluxes that are shepherded by the very colloidal particles they transport .",
    "we have discussed the electrohydrodynamic forces on a single particle in this system , and suggested how many - body coupling might give rise to the various dynamical structures we have observed . at low voltages , colloidal spheres in a specific range of charges , densities and mobilities are found to form various microscopic quasi - steady - state clusters through the competition of gravity and electrohydrodynamic levitating forces .",
    "these patterns falls into two categories : clusters levitated into the bulk and clusters localized near the lower electrode .",
    "their structures and evolutions are different , but all share some general features , such as persistent circulation and coarsening with increasing voltage .",
    "the simple behavior of a single particle in the field demonstrates that these microscopic clusters are formed cooperatively .",
    "patterns dependence on such control parameters as the composition and number density of particles , cell thickness @xmath2 , salt concentration and applied voltage range have been discussed ."
