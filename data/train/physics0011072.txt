    "metastable helium has been the subject of many experimental investigations at cold and ultracold temperatures .",
    "these include various methods of laser cooling and trapping , production of an intense beam @xcite , optical collisions in magneto - optical traps and measurements of two - body trap loss rates , including that due to penning ionization , photoassociation spectroscopy @xcite and magnetostatic trapping @xcite .",
    "there have also been several theoretical studies  .",
    "much of this interest has been stimulated by the prospect of obtaining a bose - einstein condensate with spin - polarized metastable helium @xmath3 atoms  @xcite ; a quest successfully realized very recently @xcite .",
    "the penning ionization ( pi ) and associative ionization ( ai ) processes , @xmath4 have high threshold rates in an unpolarized gas and limit the achievable density of trapped atoms . here",
    "we denote a @xmath5 ) atom by the symbol @xmath6 .",
    "however , these autoionization processes are spin - forbidden and suppressed   from the spin - polarized state and only via the weak spin - dipole interaction can such processes occur .",
    "consequently , a sufficient number of spin - polarized metastable atoms should remain trapped . in addition , the scattering length associated with the quintet potential , which controls the collision dynamics of spin - polarized metastable helium atoms , is predicted to be large and positive , a necessary requirement for a stable bose - einstein condensate . although some theoretical studies  @xcite have estimated the scattering length associated with the quintet potential to be large and positive , no detailed study of the scattering lengths for metastable helium has been previously undertaken .    in this present investigation",
    "we calculate not only the possible ranges of values for the scattering lengths directly associated with the molecular potentials , but also experimentally observable scattering lengths , elastic cross sections and inelastic rate constants over a range of scattering lengths and temperatures for collisions of metastable helium atoms in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "measurement of cross sections or rates should then provide information on the scattering lengths and hence the potentials .    for this theoretical investigation",
    "we have chosen to simulate the penning and associative ionization processes that occur at small internuclear separations from the singlet and triplet molecular states by a complex optical potential .",
    "the complex interaction potentials then have the form @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the internuclear separation of the two atoms , @xmath9 is the usual adiabatic molecular potential for the molecular state @xmath10 with total spin @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is the corresponding total autoionization width representing flux loss due to the ionization processes .",
    "since the penning and associative ionization processes are spin - forbidden from the quintet state , @xmath13 .    in the absence of spectroscopic data which could be used to obtain high accuracy potentials , the adiabatic molecular potentials required in this investigation for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 molecular states",
    "were constructed using data from various sources .",
    "the long - range interaction potential was described by a multipole expansion of the form @xmath14 using the most accurate dispersion coefficients available for the he@xmath15he@xmath15 interaction ( @xmath16 au ) . the short - range @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecular potentials and their corresponding autoionization widths for penning and associative ionization were obtained from mller  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , while the short - range @xmath2 molecular potential was taken from strck and meyer  .",
    "the @xmath2 potential was reported with an uncertainty of 0.5% in the repulsive part of the potential and 1% in the attractive part of the potential .",
    "the molecular potentials for metastable helium were constructed by fitting the three short - range potentials smoothly onto the long - range dispersion interaction around @xmath17 by interpolation through this region using an akima spline fitted to @xmath18 .",
    "the uncertainties in the short - range potentials , the procedure used to connect these to the long - range potential , and the form used for the autoionization widths lead to uncertainties in the scattering lengths for the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials and subsequently to the ultracold scattering properties of metastable helium atoms . to determine the extent of these uncertainties we vary the short - range potentials by @xmath19% for five different interaction potentials which use different methods to connect the long - range and short - range potentials or have different forms of the autoionization widths . since there is no available experimental data that can be used to determine the level of accuracy of these short - range potentials , we have chosen to vary them by more than their stated uncertainty to ensure that we obtain conservative estimates for the range of scattering lengths .",
    "the first of these potentials , labeled ( a ) , uses the analytic short - range @xmath2 potential fitted smoothly onto the long - range potential at @xmath20 .",
    "the numerical @xmath0 and @xmath1 molecular potentials of ref .",

    "the autoionization widths @xmath28 of ref .",
    "@xcite were used to represent the penning and associative ionization processes .",
    "potential ( b ) is identical to ( a ) except that the short - range @xmath2 form is fitted to the long - range potential at @xmath29 .",
    "potential ( c ) is identical to ( a ) except that the exchange term has the form @xmath30 with @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "potentials ( d ) and ( e ) are identical to ( a ) but employ different forms for the autoionization widths . the autoionization width @xmath34 , given by garrison  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , is used in ( d ) .",
    "this autoionization width has a steeper exponential form which does nt dampen at small internuclear separations like @xmath35 or @xmath36 .",
    "potential ( e ) uses another alternative form of the autoionization widths which was arbitrarily constructed to assess the sensitivity of the calculated results to the form of @xmath37 and is given by : @xmath38 all the molecular potentials considered have the same long - range form since the uncertainties in the long - range multipole potential were found to have a negligible effect on the scattering lengths .",
    "the real parts of the potentials ( a ) to ( e ) with unmodified short - range forms possess the same number of bound states , calculated to be 28 for @xmath0 , 27 for @xmath1 and 15 for @xmath2 .",
    "the scattering lengths for the @xmath0 , @xmath39 and @xmath2 molecular potentials were obtained by solving a single channel radial schrdinger equation of the form , @xmath40 + k^2 \\biggr\\ } u_{s , l } ( k , r ) = 0 \\label{eq : sf1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit where @xmath41 . here",
    "@xmath42 , @xmath43 is the reduced mass of the atomic system , @xmath44 is the total energy of the system and @xmath45 is the relative rotational angular momentum . as a result of the complex interaction potential , the scattering equation ( [ eq : sf1 ] ) and the wavefunctions @xmath46 are complex .",
    "solution of this equation allowing for the non - unitarity of the hamiltonian , and subsequent fitting to free - field boundary conditions , provides a complex k - matrix and corresponding non - unitary s - matrix ( @xmath47 ) , as described previously @xcite .",
    "the complex phase shift @xmath48 , defined by @xmath49 , can then be used to calculate the complex scattering lengths @xmath50 for each molecular state @xmath10 : @xmath51 where the scattering lengths are defined by @xmath52 and the superscripts ` @xmath53 ' and ` @xmath54 ' denote real and imaginary components , respectively .",
    "this definition means that @xmath55 represents a loss process .",
    "the scattering lengths for the three molecular states were calculated as a function of the percentage variation in the corresponding short - range molecular potential for the five potential cases ( a ) to ( e ) and are displayed in fig .",

    "are plotted because the @xmath57 potentials are identical for potential cases ( a ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) and the results obtained with potential ( b ) differed by less than 5% .",
    "the @xmath56 scattering length has no imaginary component since the penning process is spin - forbidden from the @xmath58 molecular state . of particular interest is the resonance in @xmath56 at a percentage variation of @xmath59 where the short - range potential is made sufficiently shallow that a bound state is removed from the @xmath2 potential . for",
    "percentage variations @xmath60 it is found that @xmath56 is negative in contradiction to recent experimental evidence that @xmath56 is large and positive  @xcite . with potentials ( a ) and ( b )",
    "the scattering lengths @xmath61 and @xmath62 were nearly identical and are denoted by a single solid curve .",
    "the scattering lengths associated with the molecular potentials are not observable experimentally , with the exception of @xmath56 , which is approximately equal to the scattering length for the spin - polarized state .",
    "however , these scattering lengths provide unique parameterization of the @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 potentials , from which the threshold scattering properties of metastable helium atoms can be obtained . of more practical interest",
    "are the scattering lengths for collisions between atoms in given atomic states in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "to study collisions in the presence of a magnetic field a full multichannel scattering calculation must be undertaken in which the total hamiltonian describing the two - body collision includes the spin - orbit , zeeman and spin - dipole interactions in addition to the usual radial and rotational kinetic energy operators of the two atoms and the electronic hamiltonian of the quasimolecule formed during the collision .",
    "the details of such a quantum - mechanical multichannel scattering model for metastable helium is described elsewhere  @xcite . in brief , we perform the present calculations for atoms in initial atomic states @xmath63 and @xmath64 , including both @xmath65 and @xmath66-waves , and calculate the full non - unitary s - matrix which has elements @xmath67 . here",
    "we let @xmath63 and @xmath64 denote the atomic states @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the space - fixed projection of the spin @xmath65 for an individual atom .    for collision energies up to @xmath70k the contributions of entrance @xmath71 and @xmath66-waves are negligible ( note that due to symmetrization",
    "@xmath71-waves only contribute in collisions between atoms in different atomic states ) , so that only the @xmath65-wave entrance channel @xmath72,l=0 $ ] needs to be considered . the elastic cross section @xmath73 and inelastic rate @xmath74 are then given by  @xcite @xmath75 where @xmath76 is the relative atomic velocity . in the wigner threshold region ( @xmath77 )",

    "we note that for @xmath82 or @xmath83 collisions , where the total projection of the spin ( @xmath84 ) is non - zero , the collision is dominated by the @xmath2 potential .",
    "this is because parity considerations associate the @xmath1 potential with odd partial waves , and cold collisions are dominated by @xmath65 wave collisions , and the @xmath0 potential can only contribute when @xmath85 .",
    "hence inelastic processes can only occur via the weak relativistic spin - dipole interaction .",
    "the scattering lengths for these states are then almost identical to @xmath56 but with a small imaginary component .",
    "the properties of @xmath86 collisions were investigated in detail in a previous paper  @xcite .",
    "the inelastic rates for @xmath87 and @xmath88 collisions , from which ionization can occur directly via strong exchange forces , are much larger and dominate the total inelastic rate for an unpolarized gas .",
    "the @xmath87 and @xmath88 inelastic rates contain two different contributions .",
    "the first is due to exothermic inelastic processes which includes the penning rate @xmath89 and the much smaller collision rate for exothermic fine - structure changing collisions @xmath90 .",
    "the second is the rate for degenerate fine - structure changing collisions @xmath91 .",
    "for example , in ultracold @xmath87 collisions , the entrance channel @xmath92 , l=0 $ ] can decay exothermically to the three channels @xmath93,l=2 $ ] ; @xmath94,l=2 $ ] and the penning channel , and to the two degenerate channels @xmath95,l=0 $ ] and @xmath95,l=2 $ ] .",
    "the flux loss to the degenerate @xmath66-wave exit channels or exothermic @xmath66-wave exit channels ( ie @xmath96 ) only occurs via weak spin - dipole forces and is at least 3 orders of magnitude smaller than that lost to the penning channel or to degenerate @xmath97 exit channels that occurs through strong exchange forces .",
    "importantly , exothermic and degenerate inelastic processes exhibit different threshold properties .",
    "exothermic inelastic rates tend to a constant in the wigner threshold region whereas degenerate inelastic rates fall off as @xmath98 since , as for elastic processes , the incident and final wave number are identical . to represent these separate threshold behaviors in the inelastic rates , we write @xmath99 .",
    "the slope and intercept of @xmath100 vs @xmath101 , for @xmath101 in the wigner threshold region , then gives the degenerate and exothermic scattering lengths @xmath102 and @xmath103 , respectively .",
    "we have calculated these imaginary and the real scattering lengths for all possible collision processes in spin - polarized metastable helium for the five different potentials under investigation . from these calculated scattering lengths",
    "one can use eq .",
    "( [ rateeqnl ] ) to calculate the partial rates or the total rates in an unpolarized gas at temperatures where the wigner threshold approximation is valid .",
    "the scattering lengths are calculated assuming a magnetic field of 10 gauss , however we find only a weak dependence on the magnetic field and results for fields in the range 0 to 20 gauss differ by less than 1% .",
    "the scattering lengths can be used to calculate the rates and cross sections up to typically @xmath104k , except where the scattering lengths become @xmath105 .",
    "scattering lengths for @xmath87 and @xmath88 collisions ( with @xmath65 and @xmath66-waves ) depend on both the @xmath2 and @xmath0 potentials and so their scattering lengths are a function of both the percentage variation of the short - range @xmath2 and @xmath0 potentials for potential cases ( a ) to ( e ) . however , we find that for a fixed percentage variation of the @xmath2 potential , the uncertainty in the scattering lengths induced by varying the short - range @xmath0 potential by @xmath106 is similar to that calculated by fixing the percentage variation in the @xmath0 potential to zero and using the five different potential cases ( a ) to ( e ) . in all instances",
    "the percentage variation in the @xmath2 potential has the largest effect on the scattering lengths and resulting rates .",
    "the @xmath107 or @xmath83 interactions depend only weakly on the singlet potential via the weak relativistic spin - dipole interaction and we find that varying the short - range @xmath0 potential for these collisions produces negligible changes in the scattering length .",
    "therefore we only report scattering lengths as a function of the percentage variation in the @xmath2 potential for potential cases ( a ) to ( e ) , with the understanding that similar uncertainties result in the @xmath87 and @xmath88 scattering lengths by varying the short - range singlet potential .",
    "figures [ a5eim ] , [ ars ] and [ ais ] show the real and imaginary components of the scattering lengths for @xmath108 and @xmath88 collisions .",
    "the real scattering lengths all possess a resonance in the region where a bound state is removed from the @xmath2 potential and @xmath56 goes through @xmath109 .",
    "similar plots exist for @xmath110 and @xmath111 collisions but are almost identical to that shown in fig .",
    "[ a5eim ] for @xmath86 since all are dominated by the @xmath2 potential .",
    "the underlying @xmath2 potentials are identical for potential cases ( a ) , ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) and we found that @xmath112 calculated with these potentials differed from those obtained using potential ( b ) by less than 2% .",
    "these small differences are not observable on the scale used in fig .",
    "[ a5eim ] and so for clarity a single solid curve is used to represent @xmath112 for the five potential cases . similarly for @xmath113 the results were identical except for cases ( d ) and ( e ) where different forms of the autoionization widths were used , and so we show only results for ( a ) , ( d ) and ( e ) potential cases .",
    "we note that imaginary scattering lengths for collisions where the total spin projection is non - zero possess no degenerate component and the exothermic contributions are negligible when compared to those for @xmath87 and @xmath88 collisions where penning ionization can occur via exchange forces .    for @xmath87 and @xmath88 collisions the values of @xmath114 in fig .",

    "[ ais ] we show @xmath115 and @xmath116 for these collisions .",
    "the scattering lengths @xmath115 , which measure @xmath117 , are independent of the percentage variation in the @xmath2 potential and thus @xmath56 , except very near the @xmath56 resonance where the contribution from @xmath90 is no longer negligible and a small increase in @xmath103 is observable .",
    "therefore , the measurement of the ionization signal from trapped metastable helium atoms does not provide information about @xmath56 , the parameter which is required to make predictions of the formation or properties of a bose condensate of spin - polarized metastable helium atoms .",
    "if @xmath90 is neglected then a simple examination of the hamiltonian shows that @xmath118 .",

    "tested only those with very different exchange terms provided significantly different results and consequently @xmath116 for potentials ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) and ( e ) were nearly identical . for convenience",
    "only @xmath127 for potentials ( a ) and ( c ) have been plotted in fig.[ais ] .",
    "the elastic cross section depends on the real and imaginary scattering lengths and its measurement in a spin - polarized or unpolarized gas may provide useful information on @xmath56 . in figs .",

    ", the use of scattering lengths is inappropriate and thermal averaging is required .",

    "the total thermally - averaged penning rates and cross sections for an unpolarized gas are obtained assuming an equal population of the @xmath138 magnetic substates so that @xmath139 and hence @xmath140 where @xmath141 denotes the thermal average . in this case",
    "the assumption that the magnetic substates are evenly populated in an unpolarized gas is well justified on collisional grounds . at temperatures above",
    "@xmath129k the degenerate rates @xmath142 evenly mix @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 atoms . at lower temperatures the penning rates @xmath143 and @xmath144 , which dominate the exothermic inelastic rates , deplete the three different atomic populations @xmath145 equally since @xmath146 and the collision of @xmath87 results in the loss of two @xmath124 atoms . here",
    "we have neglected the small contribution from spin - dipole processes , that is @xmath147 , and assume that any initial asymmetry in the populations @xmath145 due to preparation of the atoms in a light field for instance is small or has become small once the measurement of the collisional rate in the absence of light is performed .",
    "the thermally - averaged results were calculated by averaging over a maxwell - boltzmann distribution of atomic velocity using 71 velocity nodes which correspond to collision energies in the range @xmath148k to @xmath149k .",
    "since the results are for the case ( a ) potentials , with the percentage variation in the singlet potential set to zero , we estimate from the uncertainties in the scattering lengths that the errors in the elastic cross sections and total inelastic rates are of the order of 10% and 40% respectively .",
    "the penning rates possess a larger uncertainty to account for the percentage variation of the @xmath150 potential whereas the unpolarized elastic rates , which are dominated by the real scattering lengths belonging to collisions with @xmath151 or 1 , are controlled only by @xmath152 .    in an unpolarized gas",
    "the @xmath71-waves can contribute in @xmath88 , @xmath153 and @xmath83 collisions .",
    "these contributions to the total thermally - averaged penning rates were found to be negligible at 1 @xmath43k .",
