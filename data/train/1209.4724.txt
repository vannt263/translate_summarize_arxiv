    "competitions play an important role in society @xcite , economics @xcite , and politics .",
    "furthermore , competitions underlie biological evolution and are replete in ecology , where species compete for food and resources @xcite .",
    "sports are an ideal laboratory for studying competitions @xcite .",
    "in contrast with evolution , where records are incomplete , the results of sports events are accurate , complete , and widely available @xcite .",
    "randomness is inherent to competitions .",
    "the outcome of a single match is subject to a multitude of factors including game location , weather , injuries , etc , in addition to the inherent difference in the strengths of the opponents .",
    "just as the outcome of a single game is not predictable , the outcome of a long series of games is also not completely certain . in this paper",
    ", we review a series of our studies that focus on the role of randomness in competitions @xcite . among the questions we ask",
    "are : what is the likelihood that the strongest team wins a championship ?",
    "what is the likelihood that the weakest team wins ?",
    "how efficient are the common competition formats and how `` accurate '' is their outcome ?",
    "we introduce an elementary model where a weaker team wins against a stronger team with a fixed _ upset probability _ @xmath4 , and use this elementary random process to analyze a series of competitions @xcite . to help calibrate our model , we first determine the favorite and the underdog from the win - loss record over many years of sports competition from several major sports .",
    "we find that the distribution of win percentage approaches a universal scaling function when the number of games and the number of teams are both large .",
    "we then simulate a realistic number of games and a realistic number of teams , and demonstrate that our basic competition process successfully captures the empirical distribution of win percentage in professional baseball @xcite .",
    "moreover , we study the empirical upset frequency and observe that this quantity differentiates professional sports leagues , and furthermore , illuminates the evolution of competitive balance .",
    "next , we apply the competition model to single - elimination tournaments where , in each match , the winner advances to the next round and the loser is eliminated @xcite .",
    "we use the very same competition rules where the underdog wins with a fixed probability . here , we introduce the notion of innate strength and assume that entering the competition , the teams are ranked .",
    "we find that the typical rank of the winner decays algebraically with the size of the tournament .",
    "moreover , the rank distribution for the winner has a power - law tail .",
    "hence , larger tournaments do produce stronger winners , but nevertheless , even the weakest team may have a realistic chance of winning the entire tournament .",
    "therefore , tournaments are efficient but unfair .",
    "further , we study the league format , where every team plays every other team @xcite .",
    "we note that the number of wins for each team performs a biased random walk . using heuristic scaling arguments",
    ", we establish that the top @xmath1 teams have a realistic chance of becoming champion , while it is highly unlikely that the weakest teams can win the championship .",
    "in addition , the total number of games required to guarantee that the best team wins is cubic in @xmath0 . in this sense , leagues are fair but inefficient .",
    "finally , we propose a gradual elimination algorithm as an efficient way to determine the champion .",
    "this hybrid algorithm utilizes a preliminary round where the teams play a small number of games and a small fraction of the teams advance to the next round .",
    "the number of games in the preliminary round is large enough to ensure the stronger teams advance . in the championship round ,",
    "each team plays every other team ample times to guarantee that the strongest team always wins .",
    "this algorithm yields a significant improvement in efficiency compared to a standard league schedule .",
    "the rest of this paper is organized as follows . in section ii , the basic competition model is introduced and its predictions are compared with empirical standings data . the notion of innate team strength",
    "is incorporated in section iii , where the random competition process is used to model single - elimination tournaments . scaling laws for the league format",
    "are derived in section iv .",
    "scaling concepts are further used to analyze the gradual elimination algorithm proposed in section v. finally , basic features of our results are summarized in section vi .",
    "in our competition model , @xmath0 teams participate in a series of games .",
    "two teams compete head to head and , at the end of each match , one team is declared the winner and the other as the loser .",
    "there are no ties .",
    "to study the effect of randomness on competitions , we consider the scenario where there is a fixed _ upset probability _",
    "@xmath4 that a weaker team upsets a stronger team @xcite .",
    "this probability has the bounds @xmath5 .",
    "the lower bound corresponds to predictable games where the stronger team always wins , and the upper bound corresponds to random games .",
    "we consider the simplest case where the upset probability @xmath4 does not change with time and is furthermore independent of the relative strengths of the competitors .    in each game , we determine the stronger and the weaker team from current win - loss records .",
    "let us consider a game between a team with @xmath6 wins and a team with @xmath7 wins .",
    "the competition outcome is stochastic : if @xmath8 , @xmath9 where @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath11 , the winner is chosen randomly .",
    "initially , all teams have zero wins and zero losses .",
    "we use a kinetic framework to analyze the outcome of this random process @xcite , taking advantage of the fact that the number of games is a measure of time .",
    "we randomly choose the two competing teams and update the time by , with , after each competition .",
    "with this normalization , each team participates in one competition per unit time .",
    "let @xmath12 be the fraction of teams with @xmath6 wins at time @xmath13 .",
    "this probability distribution must be normalized , @xmath14 . in the limit @xmath15",
    ", this distribution evolves according to @xmath16 for @xmath17 . here",
    "we also introduced two cumulative distribution functions : @xmath18 is the fraction of teams with less than @xmath6 wins and @xmath19 is the fraction of teams with more than @xmath6 wins .",
    "of course , @xmath20 .",
    "the first two terms on the right - hand - side of account for games in which the stronger team wins , and the next two terms correspond to matches where the weaker team wins .",
    "the last two terms account for games between teams of equal strength ( the numerical prefactor is combinatorial ) .",
    "accounting for the boundary condition @xmath21 and summing the rate equations , we readily verify that the normalization @xmath22 is preserved .",
    "the initial conditions are @xmath23 .    in contrast to @xmath24 ,",
    "the cumulative distribution functions obey closed evolution equations .",
    "in particular , the quantity @xmath25 evolves according to @xcite @xmath26 which may be obtained by summing .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath27 and @xmath28 , and the initial condition is @xmath29 for @xmath30 .",
    "we note that the average number of wins , @xmath31 , where @xmath32 , follows from the fact that each team participates in one competition per unit time and that one win is awarded in each game .",
    "as , we can verify that by summing the rate equations .",
    "we first discuss the asymptotic behavior when the number of games is very large . in the limit @xmath33",
    ", we use the continuum approach and replace the difference equations with the partial differential equation @xcite @xmath34\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial k}=0\\,.\\ ] ] according to our model , the weakest team wins at least a fraction @xmath4 of its games , on average , and similarly , the strongest team wins no more than a fraction @xmath35 of its games .",
    "hence , the number of wins is proportional to time , @xmath36 .",
    "we thus seek the scaling solution @xmath37 here and throughout this paper , the quantity @xmath38 is the scaled cumulative distribution of win percentage ; that is , the fraction of teams that win less than a fraction @xmath39 of games played . the boundary conditions are @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we now substitute the scaling form into , and find that the scaling function satisfies where prime denotes derivative with respect to @xmath39 .",
    "there are two solutions : and the linear function .",
    "therefore , the distribution of win percentages is piecewise linear @xmath42 as expected , there are no teams with win percentage less than the upset probability @xmath4 , and there are no teams with win percentage greater than the complementary probability @xmath35 .",
    "furthermore , one can verify that .",
    "the linear behavior in indicates that the actual distribution of win percentage becomes uniform , @xmath43 for @xmath44 , when the number of games is very large .",
    "versus win percentage @xmath39 for @xmath45 at times @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "also shown for reference is the limiting behavior .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    as shown in figure 1 , direct numerical integration of the rate equation confirms the scaling behavior .",
    "moreover , as the number of games increases , the function @xmath38 approaches the piecewise - linear function given by equation .",
    "however , there is a diffusive boundary layer near @xmath48 and @xmath49 , whose width decreases as @xmath50 in the long - time limit @xcite .    generally , the win percentage is a convenient measure of team strength .",
    "for example , major league baseball ( mlb ) in the united states , where teams play @xmath51 games during the regular season , uses win percentage to rank teams .",
    "the fraction of games won is preferred over the number of wins because throughout the season there are small variations between the number of games played by various teams in the league .",
    "versus win percentage @xmath39 for : ( i ) monte carlo simulations of the competition process with @xmath52 , and ( ii ) season - end standings for major league baseball ( mlb ) over the past century ( 1901 - 2005).,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the piecewise - linear scaling function in holds in the asymptotic limits @xmath53 and @xmath33 .",
    "to apply the competition model , we must use a realistic number of games and a realistic number of teams . to test whether the competition model faithfully describes the win percentage of actual sports leagues , we compared the results of monte carlo simulations with historical data for a variety of sports leagues @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we give one representative example : major league baseball .    in our simulations , there are @xmath0 teams , each participating in exactly @xmath13 games throughout the season . in each match ,",
    "two teams are selected at random , and the outcome of the competition follows the stochastic rule : with the upset probability @xmath4 , the team with the lower win percentage is victorious , but otherwise , the team with the higher win percentage wins . at the start of the simulated season , all teams have an identical record .",
    "we treated the upset frequency as a free parameter and found that the value @xmath52 best describes the historical data for mlb ( @xmath54 and @xmath55 ) .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - phi - mlb ] , the competition model faithfully captures the empirical distribution of win percentages at the end of the season .",
    "the latter distribution is calculated from all season - end standings over the past century ( 1901 - 2005 ) .",
    "in addition , we directly measured the actual upset frequency @xmath56 from the outcome of all @xmath57 games played over the past century . to calculate the upset frequency , we chronologically ordered all games and recreated the standings at any given day .",
    "then we counted the number of games in which the winner was lower in the standings at the time of the current game .",
    "game location and the margin of victory were ignored . for mlb",
    ", we find the value @xmath58 , only slightly higher than the model estimate @xmath52 .    the standard deviation in win percentage , @xmath59 , defined by @xmath60 ,",
    "is commonly used to quantify parity of a sports league @xcite .",
    "for example , in baseball , where the win percentage typically varies between @xmath61 and @xmath62 , the historical standard deviation is @xmath63 . from the cumulative distribution , it straightforwardly follows that the standard deviation varies linearly with the upset probability , @xmath64 there is an obvious relationship between the predictability of individual games and the competitive balance of a league : the more random the outcome of an individual game , the higher the degree of parity between teams in the league .     as a function of time @xmath13 . shown",
    "are results of numerical integration of the rate equation with @xmath45 . also shown for reference",
    "is the limiting value @xmath65.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the standard deviation is a convenient quantity because it requires only year - end standings , which consist of only @xmath0 data points per season . the upset frequency , on the other hand , requires the outcome of each game , and therefore involves a much larger number of data points , @xmath66 per season .",
    "yet , as a measure for competitive balance , the upset frequency has an advantage @xcite . as seen in figure [ fig - sigmat ] , the quantity @xmath59 consists of two contributions : one due to the intrinsic nature of the game and one due to the finite length of the season .",
    "for example , the large standard deviation @xmath67 in the national football league ( nfl ) is in large part due to the extremely short season , @xmath68 .",
    "therefore , the upset frequency , which is decoupled from the length of the season , provides a more accurate measure of competitive balance @xcite .",
    "the evolution of the upset frequency over time is truly fascinating ( figure [ fig - sigma ] ) .",
    "although @xmath4 varies over a narrow range , this quantity can differentiate the four sports leagues .",
    "the historical data shows that mlb has consistently had the least predictable games , while nba and nfl games have been the most predictable .",
    "the trends for @xmath4 for these sports leagues are even more interesting .",
    "certain sports leagues ( mlb and to a larger extent , nfl ) managed to increase competitiveness by changing competition formats , increasing the number of teams , having unbalanced schedules where stronger teams play more challenging opponents , or using a draft where the weakest team can first pick the most promising upcoming talent .    in spite of the fact that nhl and nba implemented some of these same measures to increase competitiveness , there are no clear long - term trends in the evolution of the upset probability in these two leagues .",
    "another plausible interpretation of figure [ fig - sigma ] is that the sports leagues are striving to achieve an optimal upset frequency of @xmath69 .",
    "one may even speculate that the various sports leagues compete against each other to attract public interest , and that making the games less predictable , and hence , more interesting to follow is a key objective in this evolutionary - like process @xcite . in any event , the upset frequency is a natural and transparent measure for the evolution of competitive balance in sports leagues .     with time .",
    "shown is data @xcite for : ( i ) major league baseball ( mlb ) , ( ii ) the national hockey league ( nfl ) ( iii ) the national basketball association ( nba ) , and ( iv ) the national football league ( nfl ) .",
    "the quantity @xmath4 is the cumulative upset frequency for all games played in the league up to the given year . in football ,",
    "a tie counts as one half of a win.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    the random process involves only a single parameter , @xmath4 .",
    "the model does not take into account many aspects of real competitions including the game score , the game location , the relative team strength , and the fact that in many sports leagues the schedule is unbalanced , as teams in the same geographical region may face each other more often .",
    "nevertheless , with appropriate implementation , the competition model specified in equation captures basic characteristics of real sports leagues .",
    "in particular , the model can be used to estimate the distribution of team win percentages as well as the upset frequency .",
    "thus far , our approach did not include the notion of innate team strength .",
    "randomness alone controlled which team reaches the top of the standings and which teams reaches at the bottom .",
    "indeed , the probability that a given team has the best record at the end of the season equals @xmath70 .",
    "furthermore , we have used the cumulative win - loss record to define team strength . however",
    ", this definition can not be used to describe tournaments where the number of games is small .",
    "we now focus on single - elimination tournaments , where the winner of a game advances to the next round of play while the loser is eliminated @xcite .",
    "a single - elimination tournament is the most efficient competition format : a tournament with @xmath71 teams requires only @xmath72 games through @xmath73 rounds of play to crown a champion . in the first round , there are @xmath0 teams and the @xmath74 winners advance to the next round .",
    "similarly , the second round produces @xmath75 winners . in general",
    ", the number of competitors is cut by half at each round @xmath76    in many tournaments , for example , the ncaa college basketball tournament in the united states or in tennis championships , the competitors are ranked according to some predetermined measure of their strength .",
    "thus , we introduce the notion of rank into our modeling framework .",
    "let @xmath77 be the rank of the @xmath78th team with @xmath79 in our definition , a team with lower rank is stronger .",
    "rank measures innate strength , and hence , it does not change with time .",
    "since ranking is strict , we use the uniform ranking scheme @xmath80 without loss of generality .",
    "again , we assume that there is a fixed probability @xmath4 that the underdog wins the game , so that the outcome of each match is stochastic .",
    "when a team with rank @xmath81 faces a team with rank @xmath82 , we have @xmath83 when @xmath84 .",
    "the important difference with is that the losing team is now eliminated .",
    "let @xmath85 be the distribution of rank for all competitors .",
    "this quantity is normalized , @xmath86 . in a two - team tournament ,",
    "the rank distribution of the winner , @xmath87 , is given by @xmath88 + 2q\\,w_1(x)w_1(x),\\ ] ] where @xmath89 is the cumulative distribution of rank .",
    "the structure of this equation resembles that of , with the first term corresponding to games where the favorite advances , and the second term to games where the underdog advances .",
    "mathematically , there is a basic difference with eq .   in that equation",
    "does not contain loss terms .",
    "again , ties are not allowed to occur . by integrating ,",
    "we obtain the closed equation .    in general , the cumulative distribution obeys the nonlinear recursion equation @xmath90 ^ 2.\\ ] ] here , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 is the rank distribution for the winner of an @xmath0-team tournament .",
    "the boundary conditions are @xmath93 and @xmath94 .",
    "the prefactor @xmath95 arises because there are two ways to choose the winner .",
    "the quadratic nature of equation reflects that two teams compete in each match ( competitions with three teams are described by cubic equations @xcite ) . starting with @xmath96 that corresponds to uniform ranking , @xmath97",
    ", we can follow how the distribution of rank evolves by iterating the recursion equation . as shown in figure [ fig - wn ] , the rank of the winner decreases as the size of the tournament increases .",
    "hence , larger tournaments produce stronger winners .",
    "is calculated by iterating equation with @xmath45.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    by substituting @xmath96 into equation , we find @xmath98 and in general , @xmath99 .",
    "this behavior suggests the scaling form @xmath100 where the scaling factor @xmath101 is the typical rank of the winner .",
    "this quantity decays algebraically with the size of the tournament , @xmath102 when games are perfectly random ( upset probability ) , the typical rank of the winner becomes independent of the number of teams , @xmath103 .",
    "when the games are highly predictable , the top teams tend to win the tournament , @xmath104 .",
    "again , the scaling behavior shows that larger tournaments tend to produce stronger champions .    by substituting into",
    ", we see that the scaling function @xmath105 obeys the nonlocal and nonlinear equation @xmath106 the boundary conditions are @xmath107 and @xmath108 . from equation",
    ", we deduce the asymptotic behaviors @xmath109 with the scaling exponent @xmath110 .",
    "the large-@xmath111 behavior is obtained by substituting @xmath112 into and noting that since @xmath113 when @xmath114 , the correction obeys the linear equation @xmath115 .",
    "the large-@xmath111 behavior of the scaling function @xmath105 gives the likelihood that a very weak team manages to win the entire tournament .",
    "the scaling behavior is equivalent to @xmath116 with @xmath117 . in the limit @xmath118 ,",
    "the distribution approaches a constant @xmath119 .",
    "however , the tail of the rank distribution is algebraic @xmath120 when @xmath114 .",
    "the exponent @xmath121 increases monotonically with @xmath35 , and it diverges in the limit @xmath122 @xcite .",
    "moreover , the probability that the weakest team wins the tournament , @xmath123 , decays algebraically with the total number of teams , @xmath124 . in the following section , we discuss sports leagues and find that : ( i ) the rank distribution of the winner has an _ exponential _ tail , and ( ii ) the probability that the weakest team is crowned league champion is exponentially small .",
    "the scaling behavior indicates universal statistics when the size of the tournament is sufficiently large .",
    "once rank is normalized by typical rank , the resulting distribution does not depend on tournament size .",
    "further , the scaling law and the power - law tail reflect that tournaments can produce major upsets . with a relatively small number of upset wins ,",
    "a `` cinderella '' team can emerge , and for this reason , tournaments can be very exciting .",
    "furthermore , tournaments are maximally efficient as they require a minimal number of games to decide a champion .",
    "figure [ fig - ncaa ] shows that our theoretical model nicely describes empirical data @xcite for the ncaa college basketball tournament in the united states @xcite . in the current format ,",
    "64 teams participate in four sub - tournaments , each with @xmath125 teams .",
    "the four winners of each sub - tournament advance to the final four , which ultimately decides the champion .",
    "prior to the tournament , a committee of experts ranks the teams from @xmath126 to @xmath127 .",
    "we note that the game schedule is not random , and is designed such that the top teams advance if there are no upsets .     versus the rank @xmath39 for ( i ) ncaa tournament data ( 1979 - 2006 ) , ( ii ) iteration of the equation .,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    consistent with our theoretical results , the ncaa tournament has been producing major upsets : the @xmath128th seed team has advanced to the final four twice over the past 30 years .",
    "moreover , only once did all of the four top - seeded teams advance simultaneously ( 2008 ) .",
    "our model estimates the probability of this event at @xmath129 , a figure that is of the same order of magnitude as the observed frequency @xmath130 .",
    "we also mention that in producing the theoretical curve in figure [ fig - ncaa ] , we used the upset frequency , whereas the actual game results yield @xmath131 .",
    "this larger discrepancy ( compared with the mlb analysis above ) is due to a number of factors including the much smaller dataset ( @xmath132 games ) and the non - random game schedule .",
    "indeed , our monte - carlo simulations which incorporate a realistic schedule give better estimates for the upset frequency @xcite .",
    "we now discuss the common competition format in which each team hosts every other team exactly once during the season .",
    "this format , first used in english soccer , has been adopted in many sports . in a league of size @xmath0 ,",
    "each team plays @xmath133 games and the total number of games equals @xmath134 .",
    "given this large number of games , does the strongest team always wins the championship ?    to answer this question , we assume that each team has an innate strength and rank the teams according to strength . without loss of generality , we use the uniform rank distribution @xmath135 and its cumulative counterpart @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",
    "moreover , we implicitly take the large-@xmath0 limit . consider a team with rank @xmath39 . the probability @xmath138 that this team wins a game against a randomly - chosen opponent decreases linearly with rank , @xmath139 as follows from @xmath140+qw_1(x)$ ]",
    "[ see also equation ] .",
    "consistent with our competition rules and , the probability @xmath138 satisfies @xmath141 .",
    "since team strength does not change with time , the average number of wins @xmath142 for a team with rank @xmath39 grows linearly with the number of games @xmath13 , @xmath143 accordingly , the number of wins of a given team performs a biased random walk : after each game the number of wins increases by one with probability @xmath144 , and remains unchanged with the complementary probability @xmath145 .",
    "also , the uncertainty in the number of wins , @xmath146 , grows diffusively with @xmath13 , @xmath147 with diffusion coefficient @xmath148 @xcite .",
    "let us assume that each team plays @xmath13 games .",
    "if the number of games is sufficiently large , the best team has the most wins .",
    "however , at intermediate times , it is possible that a weaker team has the most wins .",
    "for a team with strength @xmath101 to still be in contention at time @xmath13 , the difference between its expected number of wins and that of the top team should be comparable with the diffusive uncertainty @xmath149 we now substitute equations - into this heuristic estimate and obtain the typical rank of the leader as a function of time , @xmath150 in obtaining this estimate , we tacitly ignored numeric prefactors , including in particular , the dependence on @xmath4 .",
    "this crude estimate shows that the best team does not always win the league championship .",
    "since @xmath151 , we have @xmath152 since rank is a normalized quantity , the top @xmath1 of the teams have a realistic chance of emerging with the best record at the end of the season .",
    "thus randomness plays a crucial role in determining the champion : since the result of an individual game is subject to randomness , the outcome of a long series of games reflects this randomness .",
    "needed for the best team to emerge as champion in a league of size @xmath0 .",
    "the simulation results represent an average over @xmath153 simulated sports leagues .",
    "also shown for reference is the theoretical prediction.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    we can also obtain the total number of games @xmath154 needed for the best team to always emerge as the champion , @xmath155 this scaling behavior follows by replacing @xmath101 in with @xmath70 which corresponds to the best team . for the best team to win , each team must play every other team @xmath156 times ! alternatively",
    "the number of games played by each team scales quadratically with the size of the league .",
    "clearly , such a schedule is prohibitively long , and we conclude that the traditional schedule of playing each opponent with equal frequency is neither efficient nor does it guarantee the best champion .",
    "we confirmed the scaling law numerically . in our monte carlo simulations ,",
    "the teams are ranked from @xmath126 to @xmath0 at the start of the season .",
    "we implemented the traditional league format where every team plays every other team and kept track of the leader defined as the team with the best record .",
    "we then measured the last - passage time @xcite , that is , the time in which the best team takes the lead for good .",
    "we define the average of this fluctuating quantity as @xmath154 @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure [ fig - tn ] , the total number of games required is cubic .    again , we expect that the probability distribution @xmath157 that a team with rank @xmath39 has the best record after @xmath13 games is characterized by the scale @xmath101 given in @xmath158 numerical results confirm this scaling behavior @xcite .",
    "since the number of wins performs a biased random walk , we expect that the distribution of the number of wins becomes normal in the long - time limit .",
    "moreover , the scaling function in has a gaussian tail @xcite @xmath159 as @xmath160 .",
    "using this scaling behavior , we can readily estimate the probability that worst team becomes champion ( in the standard league format ) .",
    "for the worst team , @xmath161 , and the corresponding scaling variable in equation is @xmath162 .",
    "hence , the gaussian tail shows that the probability @xmath163 that the weakest team wins the league is exponentially small , @xmath164 in sharp contrast with tournaments , where this probability is algebraic , leagues do not produce upset champions .",
    "leagues may not guarantee the absolute top team as champion , but nevertheless , they do produce worthy champions .    ,",
    "the probability that the @xmath165-ranked team has the best record at the end of the season in the format of playing all opponents with equal frequency , and the probability that the @xmath165-ranked team wins an @xmath0-team single - elimination tournament .",
    "the upset probability is @xmath166 and @xmath125.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    to compare leagues and tournaments , we calculated the probability @xmath167 that the @xmath168th ranked team is champion for a realistic number of games @xmath125 and a realistic upset probability @xmath166 ( figure [ fig - lt ] ) . for leagues , we calculated this probability from monte carlo simulations , and for tournaments , we used equation .",
    "indeed , the top four teams fare better in a league format while the rest of the teams are better off in a tournament .",
    "this behavior is fully consistent with the above estimate that the top @xmath1 teams have a realistic chance to win the league .    what is the probability @xmath169 that the top team ends the season with the best record in a realistic sports league ? to answer this question , we investigated the four major sports leagues in the us : mlb , nhl , nfl , and nba .",
    "we simulated a league with the actual number of teams @xmath0 and the actual number of games @xmath13 , using the empirical upset frequencies ( see figure [ fig - sigmat ] ) .",
    "all of these sports leagues have comparable number of teams , @xmath170 .",
    "surprisingly , we find almost identical probabilities for three of the sports leagues : ( i ) mlb with the longest season and most random games ( @xmath55 , @xmath171 ) has @xmath172 , ( ii ) nfl with the shortest season but most deterministic games ( @xmath68 , @xmath173 ) has @xmath174 , and ( iii ) nhl with intermediate season and intermediate randomness ( @xmath175 , @xmath176 ) has @xmath177 .",
    "standing out as an anomaly is the value @xmath178 for the nba which has a moderate - length season but less random games ( @xmath175 and @xmath173 ) .",
    "this interesting result reinforces our previous comments about sports leagues competing against each other for interest and our hypothesis that there are optimal randomness parameters .",
    "having a powerhouse win every year does not serve the league well , but having the strongest team finish with the best record once every three years may be optimal .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that single - elimination tournaments have optimal efficiency but may produce weak champions , whereas leagues which result in strong winners are highly inefficient .",
    "can we devise a competition `` algorithm '' that guarantees a strong champion within a minimal number of games ?    as an efficient algorithm , we propose a hybrid schedule consisting of a preliminary round and a championship round @xcite .",
    "the preliminary round is designed to weed out a majority of teams using a minimal number of games , while the championship round includes ample games to guarantee the best team wins .    in the preliminary round ,",
    "every team competes in @xmath13 games .",
    "whereas the league schedule has complete graph structure with every team playing every other team , the preliminary round schedule has regular random graph structure with each team playing against the same number of randomly - chosen opponents . out of the @xmath0 teams , the @xmath179 teams with the largest number of wins in the preliminary - round advance to the championship round .",
    "the number of games @xmath13 is chosen such that the strongest team always qualifies . by the same heuristic argument leading to , the top team ranks no lower than @xmath180 after @xmath13 games .",
    "we thus require @xmath181 and consequently , each team plays @xmath182 preliminary games .",
    "the championship round uses a league format with each of the @xmath179 qualifying teams playing @xmath179 games against every other team .",
    "therefore , the total number of games , @xmath154 , has two components @xmath183 in writing this estimate , we ignore numeric prefactors , as well as the dependence on the upset frequency @xmath4 . the quantity @xmath154 is minimal when the two terms in are comparable @xcite .",
    "hence , the size of the championship round @xmath184 and the total number of games @xmath185 scale algebraically with @xmath0 , @xmath186 consequently , each team plays @xmath187 games in the preliminary round .",
    "interestingly , the existence of a preliminary round significantly reduces the number of games from @xmath3 to @xmath2 . without sacrificing the quality of the champion , the hybrid schedule yields a huge improvement in efficiency !    we can further improve the efficiency by using multiple elimination rounds . in this generalization ,",
    "there are @xmath188 consecutive rounds of preliminary play culminating in the championship round .",
    "the underlying graphical structure of the preliminary rounds is always a regular random graph , while the championship round remains a complete graph .",
    "each preliminary round is designed to advance the top teams , and the number of games is sufficiently large so that the top team advances with very high probability . when there are @xmath6 rounds , we anticipate the scaling laws @xmath189 where @xmath190 is the number of teams advancing out of the first round and @xmath191 is the total number of games . of course , when there are no preliminary rounds , @xmath192 and @xmath193 .",
    "following equation , the number of teams gradually declines in each round , @xmath194    .the exponents @xmath195 and @xmath196 in equation for @xmath197 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     according to the first term in , the number of games in the first round scales as @xmath198 , and therefore , the total number of games obeys the recursion @xmath199 indeed , if we replace @xmath184 with @xmath200 in equation we can recognize the recursion .",
    "the second term scales as @xmath201 and becomes comparable to the second when @xmath202 .",
    "hence , the scaling exponents satisfy the recursion relations @xmath203 using @xmath192 and @xmath193 , we recover @xmath204 and @xmath205 in agreement with .",
    "the general solution of is @xcite @xmath206 hence , the efficiency is optimal , and the number of games becomes linear in the limit @xmath207 . for a modest number of teams , a small number of preliminary rounds , say 1 - 3 rounds , may suffice .",
    "indeed , with as few as four elimination rounds , the number of games becomes essentially linear , @xmath208 .",
    "interestingly , the result @xmath209 indicates that championship rounds or `` playoffs '' have the optimal size @xmath210 given by @xmath211 gradual elimination is often used in the arts and sciences to decide winners of design competitions , grant awards , and prizes .",
    "indeed , the selection process for prestigious prizes typically begins with a quick glance at all nominees to eliminate obviously weak candidates , but concludes with rigorous deliberations to select the winner .",
    "multiple elimination rounds may be used when the pool of candidates is very large .    to verify numerically the scaling laws",
    ", we simulated a single preliminary round followed by a championship round .",
    "we chose the size of the preliminary round strictly according to and used a championship round where all @xmath184 teams play against all @xmath184 teams exactly @xmath184 times .",
    "we confirmed that as the number of teams increases from @xmath212 to @xmath213 to @xmath153 etc . , the probability that the best team emerges as champion is not only high but also , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "we also confirmed that the concept of preliminary rounds is useful for small @xmath0 . for @xmath214 teams ,",
    "the number of games can be reduced by a factor @xmath215 by using a single preliminary round .",
    "we introduced an elementary competition model in which a weaker team can upset a stronger team with fixed probability .",
    "the model includes a single control parameter , the upset frequency , a quantity that can be measured directly from historical game results .",
    "this idealized competition model can be conveniently applied to a variety of competition formats including tournaments and leagues .",
    "the random competition process is amenable to theoretical analysis and is straightforward to implement in numerical simulations .",
    "qualitatively , this model explains how tournaments , which require a small number of games , can produce major upsets , and how leagues which require a large number of games always produce quality champions .",
    "additionally , the random competition process enables us to quantify these intuitive features : the rank distribution of the champion is algebraic in the former schedule but gaussian in the latter .    using our theoretical framework , we also suggested an efficient algorithm where the teams are gradually eliminated following a series of preliminary rounds . in each preliminary round ,",
    "the number of games is sufficient to guarantee that the best team qualifies to the next round .",
    "the final championship round is held in a league format in which every team plays many games against every other team to guarantee that the strongest team emerges as champion . using gradual elimination ,",
    "it is possible to choose the champion using a number of games that is proportional to the total number of teams .",
    "interestingly , the optimal size of the championship round scales as the one third power of the total number of teams .",
    "the upset frequency plays a major role in our model .",
    "our empirical studies show that the frequency of upsets , which shows interesting evolutionary trends , is effective in differentiating sports leagues",
    ". moreover , this quantity has the advantage that it is not coupled to the length of the season , which varies widely from one sport to another .",
    "nevertheless , our approach makes a very significant assumption : that the upset frequency is fixed and does not depend on the relative strength of the competitors .",
    "certainly , our approach can be generalized to account for strength - dependent upset frequencies @xcite .",
    "we note that our single - parameter model fares better when the games tend to be close to random , and that model estimates for the upset frequency have larger discrepancies with the empirical data when the games become more predictable .",
    "clearly , a more sophisticated set of competition rules are required when the competitors are very close in strength , as is the case for example , in chess @xcite ."
