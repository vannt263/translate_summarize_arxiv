    "we then scale the nebular emission ( both line and continuum ) to match the @xmath304 ratio ( this ratio varies with dust extinction , and it is taken into account in this step ) .",
    "the details are as follows .",
    "we first take the ly@xmath0  ew from paper i. based on the continuum of the model spectrum , the ly@xmath0  ew , and the @xmath304 ratio , we calculate the h@xmath19  flux and ew for the model spectrum .",

    "fortunately , there are no strong lines in the wavelength range covered by the non - irac data points ( we did not use the bands that cover ly@xmath0 ) . therefore , the continuum at the wavelength of ly@xmath0  is well modeled ( see figures 2 and 3 ) .",
    "it ensures that the ly@xmath0  flux in the best - fitting model spectrum is very close to the observed flux .",

    "the latter one is a more realistic approach , and consists of two assumptions : the ratio of the observed to intrinsic ly@xmath0   flux @xmath298 is 4 , and the intrinsic ly@xmath0  to h@xmath19  flux ratio @xmath301 is 25 ( case b ) , so that @xmath305 .",
    "each assumption involves non - negligible uncertainties .",
    "for the first assumption , the probability distribution function of @xmath298 depends on the physical conditions of galaxies @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is apparently a function of redshift : it increases ( observed ly@xmath0  flux decreases ) towards higher redshifts as the neutral fraction of the igm increases . for the second assumption ,",
    "real galaxies are more complex than the assumed ideal case b recombination .    despite the uncertainties mentioned above",
    ", our assumptions are reasonable ( see more details in the discussion section ) .",
    "as we will see , the ly@xmath0-em and galev - em models produce roughly similar results on average , although there are large object - to - object variations due to the large range of the observed ly@xmath0  ew . in order to explore the possible ranges of physical parameters , we vary the @xmath304 ratio by a factor of two , i.e. , we perform another two sets of sed modeling by assuming @xmath306 ( referred to as em - strong models ) , and @xmath307 ( referred to as em - weak models ) .",
    "based on the simulations of @xcite , the majority of galaxies are included in the range considered here .",
    "we will discuss nebular emission and our assumptions in greater details in section 5 .",
    "it is worth briefly discussing the bias of our sample before we discuss the resulting stellar masses .",
    "the bias from sample selection was discussed in paper i , and in section 2 of this paper .",
    "the 42 galaxies in table 1 are brighter than @xmath308 ab mag in @xmath309 .",
    "the 27 galaxies shown in figures 1 and 4 have detections in the irac 1 band ( see also table 1 ) , so they are further limited by the 3.6 @xmath20 m flux detection limit . because the 3.6 @xmath20 m flux is closely related to stellar mass for @xmath194 galaxies , the sample of the 27 galaxies is biased towards the more massive galaxies .",
    "this is the reason that the stellar masses derived from the noem models are mostly close to or higher than @xmath199 ( see the histograms in figures 1 and 4 ) .",
    "stellar mass is thought to be the parameter that is least sensitive to model assumptions , because it is directly measured from the scaling of galaxy model spectra ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "when nebular emission is included , however , the measurement of stellar mass becomes less straightforward .",
    "figure 5 compares the stellar masses derived from models with different nebular emission .",
    "the filled grey histograms show the stellar mass distributions from the ly@xmath0-em models .",
    "the black unfilled histograms represent the mass distributions from the em - weak models ( top two panels ) and the em - strong models ( middle two panels ) .",
    "the distributions of the em - weak and em - strong models do not significantly deviate from those for the ly@xmath0-em models .",
    "the bottom panel shows the ratios of the stellar masses derived from different em models .",
    "although the mass ratios of the galev - em to ly@xmath0-em models span a wide range due to the wide distribution of the ly@xmath0  ew in our sample , the median ratio is close to 1 , suggesting that the assumptions we made for the ly@xmath0-em models are reasonable .",
    "we use the em - weak and em - strong models to explore the possible mass ranges .",
    "as expected , they show that models with stronger ( weaker ) nebular emission generally produce stellar populations with lower ( higher ) masses and younger ( older ) ages . on the other hand ,",
    "the results for most galaxies from the three em models ( ly@xmath0-em , em - weak , and em - strong ) are roughly consistent .",
    "the bottom panel shows that about 7080% galaxies in our sample have similar stellar masses ( within a factor of 3 ) from the three different em models .",
    "the upper panel of figure 6 shows the relation between the 3.6 @xmath20 m flux and stellar mass derived from models with rsfh . there is a tight relation for the noem models ( grey pluses ) , as explained above . for the em models ( the ly@xmath0-em models here ; crosses )",
    ", the correlation still exists for the whole sample , but with a much larger scatter .",
    "the relation also significantly deviates from the relation for the noem models , due to the contamination of strong nebular emission in the irac 1 band .",
    "we divide these galaxies into two subsamples : a ` young ' subsample ( age @xmath99 30 myr ; blue crosses ) and an ` old ' subsample ( age @xmath46 30 myr ; red crosses ) based on the age distributions shown in figures 4 and 8 .",
    "the old subsample consists of galaxies with ages of several hundred myr , and the galaxies in the young subsample are usually younger than 30 myr ( see subsection 4.2 ) .",
    "it is obvious that the relation between the 3.6 @xmath20 m flux and stellar mass is tight in either subsample .",
    "the linear pearson correlation coefficients for the old and young subsamples are 0.87 and 0.96 , respectively .",

    "the linear pearson correlation coefficients for the two subsamples are 0.66 and 0.92 , respectively .",
    "this relation is partially shaped by selection effects , i.e. , these objects were selected in a relatively small parameter space .",
    "it may also be partially due to the following reasons .",
    "for the old subsample , the 3.6 @xmath20 m flux is still dominated by stellar emission , and thus reflects the stellar mass . in the young subsample",
    ", nebular emission has a large contribution to the 3.6 @xmath20 m flux .",
    "on the other hand , these galaxies are within a small range of ( very young ) age , and their relative strength of the nebular to stellar emission does not span a wide range ( note that it is fixed for any galev - em model sed ) .",
    "so the combination of the nebular and stellar emission still follow the correlation , though the presence of nebular emission has largely reduced the required stellar masses .",
    "the lower panel in figure 6 shows the relation between stellar mass and rest - frame uv luminosity @xmath310 , the absolute ab mag at 1500   derived in paper i ) .",
    "the @xmath310 values have been corrected for dust extinction . as for the upper panel ,",
    "the pluses and crosses represent the noem and em models , and the red and blue crosses represent the old and young subsamples , respectively . for the noem models , there is a weak correlation in which stellar masses are higher in more luminous galaxies .",
    "such correlation is more tight in the two subsamples in the ly@xmath0-em models .",
    "the linear pearson correlation coefficients for the old and young subsamples are 0.92 and 0.99 , respectively .",
    "the lower panel of figure 7 shows the relation for dsfh , which is also obvious though less tight .",
    "the linear pearson correlation coefficients for the two subsamples are 0.67 and 0.96 , respectively .",

    "in particular , a large fraction ( @xmath313% ) of the galaxies have @xmath193 close to , or higher than @xmath314 , suggesting that very massive galaxies already exist when the universe was only @xmath315 myr old .",
    "as already mentioned , the age of a stellar population is usually poorly constrained from sed modeling , especially for high - redshift galaxies with only 35 photometric data points . during our sed",
    "fitting , we allowed the age to vary between 4 and 1000 myr .",
    "figures 1 and 4 show that the stellar populations derived from the noem models are mostly older than 100 myr .",
    "the inclusion of nebular emission largely reduces the derived age , leading to extremely young ( a few myr ) stellar populations in some galaxies .",

    ", we may divide our sample into two subsamples , based on figures 4 and 8 .",
    "one consists of old galaxies with ages of several hundred myr , and the other one includes young galaxies that are mostly only several myr old .",
    "they are referred to as ` old ' and ` young ' subsamples in section 4.1 .",
    "the bottom panel in figure 8 shows the relation between age and stellar mass derived from the ly@xmath0-em models .",
    "it suggests that slightly more than half of the galaxies are a few hundred myr old .",
    "in particular , ages in some galaxies from the rsfh models are older than 300500 myr .",
    "these galaxies usually have masses close to or higher than @xmath199 ( up to @xmath316 ) .",
    "these massive and old galaxies already appear to exist when the universe was only 0.81.0 gyr old .",
    "meanwhile , figure 8 also shows the existence of extremely young galaxies in our sample .",

    "@xcite found that some laes at @xmath319 in the hubble ultra deep field are very young ( a few myr old ) with masses between @xmath320 and @xmath321 .",
    "the young galaxies in our sample are similar to these galaxies in terms of age , but are certainly more massive .",
    "this implies that extremely young galaxies at high redshift already have a wide range of stellar masses .",
    "the bottom panels of figures 1 and 4 display the distributions of dust reddening @xmath192 . unlike age and stellar mass , the @xmath192 values derived from different models , including em models and noem models , are consistent .",
    "they clearly suggest that the majority of the galaxies in our sample have little or no dust extinction .",
    "this is indeed expected . in paper",
    "i , we reported that our galaxies have steep rest - frame uv slopes on average , with a median value of @xmath322 .",

    "this relation is referred to as the ` main sequence ' of star - forming galaxies .",
    "it evolves with redshift so that the normalization of the relation at higher redshift is higher ( at least for the redshift range @xmath325 )",
    ". the mass - sfr relation usually applies to massive galaxies with @xmath326 @xmath186 , corresponding to the old subsample in figures 6 and 8 .",
    "in addition , starburst galaxies such as ulirgs and smgs may reside well above the relation .",
    "figure 9 shows the mass - sfr relations for our galaxies , derived from the ly@xmath0-em models with rsfh ( upper panel ) and dsfh ( lower panel ) .",
    "the pluses and crosses represent the young and old subsamples , respectively .",
    "the grey symbols indicate the sfrs calculated from the uv continuum ( without correction for dust extinction ) in paper i. we correct for dust extinction using the @xmath192 values in table 3 based on the calzetti ( 2000 ) law .",
    "the results are shown as blue and red symbols .",
    "the correction is large only for the most massive galaxies in each subsample , which show moderate dust extinction as seen in section 4.3 .",
    "the two subsamples both show a tight mass - sfr relation . in the upper panel for rsfh ,",
    "the linear pearson correlation coefficients for the old and young subsamples are 0.95 and 0.99 , respectively .",
    "the coefficients in the lower panel for dsfh are 0.77 and 0.95 .",
    "the slopes are close to 1 , consistent with the results from simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ". it also agrees with the slopes found in lower - redshift galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the slope of @xmath327 indicates that the specific sfrs ( ssfrs ) are similar within either subsample .",
    "however , the average ssfr of the young subsample is much higher than that of the old subsample , so that the two subsamples are well separated in the mass - sfr diagram .",
    "this is because the two subsamples cover the similar range of sfrs , but the old subsample is ten times more massive on average .",
    "the correlation in either subsample is tight , due to the combination of a few reasons , including the intrinsic mass - sfr relation , the selection effects , and the relatively small parameter space that either subsample occupies . in particular , the correlation for the ` young ' subsample is very tight , mainly because of their extremely young ages .",
    "the galev model outputs start from 4 myr in steps of 4 myr .",
    "the ages measured in the ` young ' subsample are mostly 4 myr and 8 myr , and thus these ` young ' galaxies have not evolved considerably .",
    "figure 10 shows the ssfr as a function of redshift , taken from @xcite ( and references therein ) .",
    "it illustrates the efficiency of stellar mass growth in galaxies across cosmic time .",
    "the ssfr increases rapidly from the local universe to @xmath328 , and then flattens ( or slightly climbs ) towards higher redshifts .",
    "we focus on the high - redshift range .",
    "the @xmath329 data points in the figure were from two lbg samples of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "our results are displayed as a blue circle ( young subsample ) and a red circle ( old subsample ) .",
    "the horizontal error bars indicate the redshift range , and the vertical error bars indicate the @xmath51 range of the object number distribution ( i.e. , inclusion of 95% of the objects ) .",
    "the average ssfr of the old subsample agrees well with the two previous studies @xcite and @xcite .",
    "note that in these studies nebular emission lines were also incorporated during their sed modeling .",
    "in addition , the mass - sfr relation of the old subsample is well consistent with the simulation of @xcite .",
    "all these suggest that the galaxies in our old subsample are ` normal ' star - forming galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "the ssfrs of the old subsample are roughly consistent with ( or marginally higher than ) those at @xmath328 , suggesting that the efficiency of stellar mass growth did not change much in the most time of the first 3 gyr .",
    "the average ssfr of the young subsample is about ten times higher than the relation defined by previous studies .",
    "it has been clear that galaxies with strong starburst activity at @xmath330 are well above ( @xmath331 times ) the main sequence of star - forming galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "so the young subsample seems to be the high - redshift counterparts of @xmath330 starbursts .",
    "the fraction of such starbursts at @xmath330 is very low , while in our sample this fraction is much higher , partly due to selection effects . on the other hand , galaxies with very high ssfrs at high redshift are not rare .",
    "section 5.3 provides more discussion on this topic .",
    "the bimodal distribution of ages and ssfrs seen in figures 8 and 9 were largely explained by selection effects and modeling limitations in the above sections , though we can not rule out the possibility of an intrinsic bimodality .",
    "such bimodality has been reported for galaxies at @xmath332 by @xcite , who found that the ssfrs in their low - ssfr and high - ssfr galaxies are 0.51.0 gyr@xmath9 and @xmath410 gyr@xmath9 , respectively .",
    "this suggests that the bimodality seen in our sample may partially reflect a real bimodal distribution of ssfrs .",
    "it is clear that sed modeling of high - redshift galaxies can be largely affected by the presence of strong nebular emission . for galaxies at @xmath333 , the existence of strong lines",
    "is often evidenced by their irac 1 flux excess ( compared to the irac 2 flux ) .",
    "this is because in this redshift range , the irac 1 band covers some of the strongest lines such as [ oiii ] , h@xmath0 , and h@xmath19 . a significant fraction of galaxies at @xmath10 , including photometrically selected and spectroscopically confirmed galaxies , show a strong irac 1 flux excess ( e.g. * ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in fact , many galaxies in our sample also show such an excess . at @xmath334 ,",
    "galaxies with strong nebular lines start to show red irac [ 3.6][4.5 ] colors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    the contribution of nebular emission to the irac 1 and 2 bands can be large or dominant .",

    "does not cover any strong emission lines .",
    "the galaxies that they found have very large rest - frame ew of [ oiii]+h@xmath19  in the range of 900 to @xmath336  , with a median value of @xmath337  . in these galaxies",
    "line emission dominates the irac 1 photometry .",
    "therefore , it is expected that the galaxies in our sample have strong nebular lines .",
    "our analysis was mostly based on the ly@xmath0-em models .",
    "when we computed the ly@xmath0-em models from the galev - em models in section 3 , we scaled nebular emission lines using the observed ly@xmath0  flux . figure 11 shows the distribution of the derived scaling factors .",
    "they cover a range from 0.6 to 3.5 , with a median value 1.6 .",
    "it is expected that line emission derived from the ly@xmath0-em models is stronger than that from the galev - em models , because our galaxies were selected to have strong line emission .",
    "the scaling factors span a relatively small range ( within a factor of @xmath42 around the median value 1.6 ) , suggesting that the dynamic range of the em - strong and em - weak models is large enough to sample the majority of high - redshift galaxies .",
    "we may test our ly@xmath0-em models using a few ` special ' galaxies ( figure 12 ) not in our sample .",
    "these galaxies are spectroscopically confirmed with measured ly@xmath0  line flux , so that we can estimate nebular emission from their ly@xmath0  emission based on the ly@xmath0-em models .",
    "in addition , they are at certain redshift ranges so that one of the two irac bands covers strong nebular emission , but the other one does not . in this case",
    ", the difference of the photometry between the two bands roughly reflects the strength of nebular lines .",
    "the first two galaxies ( a and b in figure 12 ) are at @xmath338 and @xmath339 found by clment et al .",
    "( in preparation ) and by @xcite , respectively . in these two galaxies , the irac 1 band covers h@xmath19  and [ oiii ] , while the irac 2 band does not cover any strong lines .",

    "we are not able to obtain acceptable results for galaxies ( b ) and ( c ) , due to the reason that the nebular lines ( scaled from ly@xmath0 ) in the model spectra are not strong enough to account for the large difference between the irac 1 and irac 2 photometry . we note that the ly@xmath0  emission line in galaxy ( b ) is located on one of strong sky oh lines , and its flux measurement could be significantly affected , as pointed out by the discovery paper @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , we re - model the seds for galaxies ( b ) and ( c ) using the em - strong models , and obtain a reasonable fit for galaxy ( b ) .",
    "for galaxy ( c ) , however , we fail to achieve an acceptable fit ( @xmath343 ) .",

    "for all the galaxies except ( c ) , these magnitude difference values are smaller than the corresponding photometric uncertainties ( @xmath346 ) in the irac 1 and irac 2 bands .    galaxy ( c ) has very weak ly@xmath0  emission ( compared to its other nebular lines ) , as already noted by @xcite . at @xmath340 ,",
    "the igm is much more neutral than that at @xmath194 , so ly@xmath0  emission can be largely attenuated by the neutral igm or eaten by ly@xmath0  damping wings ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in other words , the ratio of intrinsic to observed ly@xmath0  flux is a function of redshift , as we mentioned in the previous section .",
    "so our assumption about this ratio is no longer valid .",
    "recent simulations suggest that the ly@xmath0  damping wing owing to patchy reionization should be fairly uniform at a given redshift @xcite . in this case , our ability to fit galaxy ( d ) but not ( c ) is not likely to reflect incomplete reionization .",
    "instead , it may indicate scatter in the level of attenuation of self - shielded systems or in the intrinsic properties of the galaxies interstellar media .    in summary",
    ", three out of the four galaxies can be well fit with our ly@xmath0-em or em - strong models .",
    "we were not able to obtain a reasonable fit for the galaxy at @xmath340 , due to the limitation ( redshift coverage ) of our models .",
    "the tests above show that our models can provide reasonable sed modeling for high - redshift galaxies with nebular emission taken into account .",
    "in section 4 we identified two subsamples in our galaxies , one ` old ' subsample with ages of several hundred myr and one ` young ' subsample with ages of several myr .",
    "either subsample follows a tight stellar mass - sfr relation .",

    "the median and standard deviation values of the slopes for the young and old subsamples are @xmath347 and @xmath348 , respectively .",
    "they are consistent .",
    "uv slopes are most sensitive to dust extinction . as we have seen in section 4.3 , there is little dust extinction in these galaxies except for several of the most massive galaxies .",
    "so the ` young ' galaxies do not show bluer slopes than the ` old ' galaxies .",

    ", the galaxies in our ` young ' subsample may have strong starburst activity as indicated by their high ssfrs .",
    "a significant fraction of low - redshift starbursts are mergers , which tend to have large sizes .",
    "there are a number of studies on the stellar populations of @xmath10 galaxies in the literature . the majority of these galaxies are photometrically selected lbgs .",
    "there was little study for @xmath10 laes . as we explained in introduction ,",

    "direct comparison with previous studies is very difficult if not impossible , because different studies use different galaxy samples ( selected from different datasets with different selection criteria ) and sed modeling methods .",
    "we mainly focus on two questions : whether extremely young populations have been reported , and whether previously reported ssfrs cover a wide range that agrees with our ` young ' and ` old ' subsamples . as we emphasized earlier , age is poorly constrained from sed modeling , so here we broadly define ` extremely young galaxies ' as those with the best - fitting ages younger than @xmath354 myr , like the galaxies in our ` young ' subsample .    in the previous studies of photometrically - selected lbgs ,",
    "extremely young galaxies have been rarely reported .",
    "the majority of these lbgs tend to have relatively old and mature populations with ages of a few hundred or several tens myr , from sed fitting without nebular emission taken into account .",
    "when nebular emission were considered ( especially in models with smoothly - varying sfhs ) , however , extremely young populations were required to explain the seds of some lbgs @xcite . for example",
    ", @xcite selected a sample of @xmath355 lbgs from @xmath2 deep fields , and found that these galaxies were mostly a few hundred myr old if nebular emission was not included in their sed modeling .",
    "when nebular emission was added , about 25% of their lbgs with irac 1 detections were found to be extremely young , with a median age of 9 myr .    in the previous studies of high - redshift laes , extremely young galaxies were found to be common .",
    "for example , @xcite stacked a large number of photometrically - selected laes at @xmath299 and 6.5 , and performed sed modeling on the stacked laes . despite",
    "that the measurements from stacked data could be unreliable ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , they found that these laes have ages of only 1 - 3 myr , little dust extinction , and strong nebular emission . in the sample of @xcite",

    "these numbers roughly agree with those found in our ` old ' and ` young ' subsamples .",

    "direct comparison between laes and lbgs is difficult because of the very different target selection procedures .",
    "as we already explained in papers i and ii , the laes in our original sample of 67 galaxies are composed of a well - defined sample in terms of ly@xmath0  flux . on the other hand ,",
    "the lbgs in the sample only represent the lbgs with strong ly@xmath0  emission since they are spectroscopically confirmed .",
    "in papers i and ii , we compared the laes and lbgs in our sample in great details , and found that the two populations are indistinguishable in all aspects of physical properties that we considered , including the ly@xmath0   emission strength , uv continuum properties , sizes , and morphology , etc .",
    "figure 14 shows the distributions of the measured stellar masses , ages , and sfrs for the laes and lbgs in our sample of 27 galaxies used in this paper .",
    "the blue pluses and the red crosses represent the lbgs and laes , respectively .",
    "the distributions of the lbgs and laes in the age - mass and sfr - mass diagrams are indistinguishable .",
    "in particular , there are 6 laes and 5 lbgs in the ` young ' subsample , and there are 9 laes and 7 lbgs in the ` old ' subsample",
    ". the number ratios of the laes to lbgs nicely agree with each other in the two subsamples .",
    "all these are consistent with our previous conclusion that the laes and lbgs in our sample have common properties , suggesting that laes are a subset of lbgs with strong ly@xmath0  emission lines .",
    "the conclusion is also consistent with recent simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "currently there are two ways to assess the strength of rest - frame optical nebular emission lines and use that information to derive the physical properties of underlying stellar population in @xmath355 galaxies : ( 1 ) to observe galaxies in specific redshift ranges where one of the irac band is line - free ( e.g. , @xmath358 galaxies as studied by smit et al .",
    "( 2014 ) ) , and ( 2 ) to model emission - line strengths based on the measured ly@xmath0 lines ( this work ) .",
    "the first method is more direct and accurate , but because of the stringent constraints on redshift , the number of galaxies that can be studied is rather small .",
    "the second method suffers from relatively large uncertainties , but can be applied to a much larger sample of @xmath355 galaxies as we have shown in this paper .",
    "although the above is the best we can do at the moment , we note that we are actually on the verge of a breakthrough as the _ jwst _ becomes available and changes the emphasis from photometry to spectroscopy .",
    "figure 15 shows the flux distributions of the [ ] 5007   and h@xmath0 lines predicted by the modeling described in this paper .",
    "the figure shows that we should be able to detect almost all these lines with a line - flux sensitivity of @xmath359 ergs @xmath360 s@xmath9 .",
    "based on the _ jwst _ prototype exposure time calculator ( etc ) , such a sensitivity will be easily reachable with nirspec . for example , to achieve a 5@xmath197 detection ( per resolution element ) of an [ ] 5007  line at @xmath361 with a line flux of @xmath362 ergs @xmath360 s@xmath9 , the required integration time will be only @xmath363 seconds . the corresponding integration time for h@xmath0",
    "( i.e. , at @xmath361 and with a line flux of @xmath362 ergs @xmath360 s@xmath9 ) will be @xmath364 seconds .",
    "these numbers clearly indicate that with _ jwst_/nirspec , it will be easy to detect [ ] and h@xmath0 lines with the brightest @xmath355 galaxies like those we have studied here .",
    "in fact , nirspec has the sensitivity to detect much fainter lines , making these bright @xmath355 sdf galaxies ideal targets for a detailed nirspec spectroscopic study . in several years",
    ", such a study will be able to test the validity of the results presented here , and will undoubtedly make many more interesting discoveries .",
    "this paper is the third in a series presenting the physical properties of a large sample of 67 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies at @xmath10 .",
    "the sample consists of 51 laes at @xmath25 , 6.5 , and 7.0 , and 16 lbgs at @xmath28 .",
    "they have deep optical imaging data from subaru , near - ir data from @xmath2 , and mid - ir data from @xmath3 . in this paper , we have reported a detailed study of stellar populations in these galaxies .",
    "we have focused on a subsample of 27 galaxies with @xmath3 irac 1 detections at 3.6 @xmath20 m .",
    "this subsample represents luminous and massive galaxies with strong ly@xmath0  emission at @xmath10 .",
    "we used the wealth of the multi - band data and the secure ly@xmath0  redshifts and flux to model the seds of the 27 galaxies and characterize their stellar populations .",
    "we used the galev evolutionary synthesis models with nebular continuum and line emission to mainly constrain three physical parameters : age , stellar mass , and dust extinction .",
    "we adopted two representative sfhs , an exponentially declining sfh ( dsfh ) and a smoothly rising sfh ( rsfh ) .",
    "we mostly used the latter two sfhs in our analysis . in order to incorporate nebular emission , we scaled the nebular emission from the galev models to match the observed ly@xmath0  flux ( the ly@xmath0-em models ) under two simple assumptions . with the ly@xmath0-em models",
    ", we were able to nicely break the strong degeneracy of model spectra between young galaxies with prominent nebular emission and mature galaxies with strong balmer breaks .",
    "our best - fitting results show that the galaxies in our sample has a wide range of sed ages from several myr to a few hundred myr .",
    "they also have a wide range of stellar masses from @xmath365 to @xmath366 .",
    "interestingly , the distribution of the measured ages ( despite the large uncertainties ) appear to be bimodal , likely due to selection effects and modeling limitations ( though we can not rule out the possibility of an intrinsic bimodality ) . based on this bimodality , we divided the galaxies into two subsamples : an ` old ' subsample and a ` young ' subsample .",
    "the ` old ' subsample mainly consists of galaxies older than 100 myr , with stellar masses higher than @xmath7 .",
    "many galaxies are older than 300500 myr .",
    "the ` young ' subsample consists of galaxies younger than 30 myr ( usually several myr old ) .",
    "these galaxies are less massive , with masses ranging between @xmath365 and @xmath367 .",
    "the majority of the galaxies both subsamples show little or no dust extinction , as already hinted by their steep rest - frame uv slopes .",
    "both subsamples show a correlation between stellar mass and sfr , but with very different normalizations .",
    "the mean ssfr of the ` old ' subsample is about 34 gyr@xmath9 , consistent with the mass - sfr relation defined by previous studies .",
    "the mean ssfr of the ` young ' subsample is an order of magnitude higher .",
    "such higher ssfrs have also been frequently reported in previous studies .",
    "they are likely due to starburst activity in these galaxies",
    ". finally , the laes and lbgs in our sample are indistinguishable in all physical properties that we have considered , suggesting that laes are a subset of lbgs with strong ly@xmath0  emission lines .",
