    "in recent years , phononics , the discipline of science and technology in processing information by phonons and controlling heat flow , becomes more and more exciting @xcite .",
    "various functional thermal devices such as thermal diode @xcite , thermal transistor @xcite , thermal logic gates @xcite and thermal memory @xcite , etc . , have been proposed to manipulate and control phonons , the carrier of heat energy and information . and",
    "very recently , similar to the hall effect of electrons , strohm _ et al .",
    "_ observed the phonon hall effect ( phe )  the appearance of a temperature difference in the direction perpendicular to both the applied magnetic field and the heat current flowing through an ionic paramagnetic dielectric sample @xcite , which was confirmed later in ref .",
    ". such observation of the phe is really surprising because phonons as charge - free quasiparticles , different from electrons , can not directly couple to the magnetic field through the lorentz force .",
    "since then , several theoretical explanations have been proposed @xcite to understand this novel phenomenon . from the work of the phe in four - terminal nano - junctions and the phonon hall conductivity in the two - dimensional periodic crystal lattice , we know that the phe can exist even in the ballistic system .",
    "geometric phase effects @xcite are fundamentally important in understanding electrical transport property in quantum hall effect @xcite , anomalous hall effect@xcite , and anomalous thermoelectric transport @xcite .",
    "it is successful in characterizing the underlying mechanism of quantum spin hall effect @xcite .",
    "such an elegant connection between mathematics and physics provides a broad and deep understanding of basic material properties . although there is a quite difference between phonons and electrons , we still can use the topological description to study the underlying properties of the phonon transport , such as topological phonon modes in dynamic instability of microtubules @xcite and in filamentary structures @xcite , berry - phase - induced heat pumping @xcite , and the berry - phase contribution of molecular vibrational instability @xcite .    the topological nature of the phe is recently studied in ref .",
    "@xcite , where a general expression for phonon hall conductivity is obtained in terms of the berry curvatures of band structures . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors find a phase transition in the phe of the honeycomb lattice , explained from topological nature and dispersion relations . from the green - kubo formula and",
    "considering the contributions from all the phonon bands , the authors obtain the general formula for the phonon hall conductivity .",
    "then by looking at the phases of the polarization vectors of both the displacements and conjugate momenta as a function of the wave vector , a berry curvature can be defined uniquely for each band . combining the above two steps , at last the phonon hall conductivity can be written in terms of berry curvatures .",
    "such derivation gives us a clear picture of the contribution to the phonon hall current from all phonon branches , as well as the relation between the phonon hall conductivity and the geometrical phase of the polarization vectors , which thus helps us to understand the topological picture of the phe .",
    "however , the process of going from the berry phase to the heat flux and the phonon hall conductivity looks not very clear and natural .",
    "we know that for the hall effect of the electrons , in addition to the normal velocity from usual band dispersion contribution , the berry curvature induces an anomalous velocity always transverse to the electric field , which gives rise to a hall current , thus the hall effect occurs @xcite . for the magnon hall effect @xcite recently observed , the authors also found the anomalous velocity due to the berry connection which is responsible for the thermal hall conductivity .",
    "therefore in this article we will derive the theory of the phe in a more natural way where the berry phase effect inducing the anomalous velocity contributes to the extra term of the heat current .",
    "thus the berry phase effect is straightforward to take the responsibility of the phe .",
    "a kagome lattice , composed of interlaced triangles whose lattice points each have four neighboring points @xcite , becomes popular in the magnetic community because the unusual magnetic properties of many real magnetic materials are associated with those characteristic of the kagome lattice @xcite .",

    "therefore , the difference between the two bands decreases below and increases above the critical magnetic field , and is zero at the critical point .",
    "the eigenfrequecy difference is in the denominator of the berry curvature , thus the variation of the difference around the critical magnetic field , dramatically affects the berry curvature of the corresponding bands . in the kagome lattice systems , we find that the touching and splitting of the phonon bands not only occurs at the @xmath0 point , but also occurs at other points , which is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] . at the first critical points @xmath175 , the bands 2 and 3 touch at the point @xmath1 ( marked by a square with number 1 ) ; at @xmath176 the two bands touch at @xmath2 ( marked by a square with number 2 ) ; while only for the third critical one @xmath177 , band 2 and 3 degenerate at the point @xmath0 ( marked by a square with number 3 ) . from the contour maps of bands 2 and 3 , we clearly see that the critical magnetic fields @xmath175 , @xmath176 , and @xmath177 , there are local maximum for the band 2 and the local minimum for the band 3 .",
    "thus for all the critical magnetic fields where the chern numbers have abrupt changes , in the wave - vector space we can always find the phonon bands touching and splitting at some symmetric center points .",
    "therefore , through the study of the phe in both honeycomb lattices @xcite and kagome lattices , we find discontinuous jumps in chern numbers , which manifest themselves as singularities of the first derivative of the phonon hall conductivity with respect to the magnetic field .",
    "such associated phase transition is connected with the crossing of band 2 and band 3 , which corresponds to the touching between a acoustic band and a optical band .",
    "however , we can not observe the similar associated phase transition in triangular lattices because of no optical bands , where the chern number of each band keeps zero while the phonon hall conductivity is nonzero because of the nonzero berry curvatures .",
    "we present a new systematic theory of the phe in the ballistic crystal lattice system , and give an example application of the phe in the kagome lattice which is a model structure of the many real magnetic materials . by the proper second quantization for the hamiltonian",
    ", we obtain the formula for the heat current density , which considers all the phonon bands including both positive and negative frequencies .",
    "the heat current density can be divided into two parts , one is the diagonal , another is off - diagonal .",
    "the diagonal part corresponds to the normal velocity ; and the off - diagonal part corresponds to the anomalous velocity which is induced by the berry vector potential .",
    "such anomalous velocity induces the phe in the crystal lattice .",
    "based on such heat current density we derive the formula of the phonon hall conductivity which is in terms of the berry curvatures . from the application on the kagome lattices , we find that at weak magnetic field , the phonon hall conductivity changes sign with varying temperatures .",
    "it is also found that the mechanism on the phe about the relation between the phonon hall conductivity , chern numbers and the phonon band structure can be generally appllied for kagome lattices . while there is only one discontinuity in phe of the honeycomb lattices , in the kagome lattices",
    "there are three singularities induced by the abrupt change of the phonon band topology , which correspond to the touching and splitting at three different symmetric center points in the wave - vector space .",
