    "hard x - ray surveys of the galaxy provide an opportunity to discover populations of extreme sources .",
    "the promise of such surveys has been partially realized with the _ international gamma - ray astrophysics laboratory _ ( _ integral _ , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which carried out a 20100kev survey of the entire galactic plane and has discovered hundreds of new sources @xcite , including new types of high mass x - ray binaries ( hmxbs ) , pulsar wind nebulae ( pwne ) , and magnetic cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) .",
    "the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array _ ( _ nustar _ , * ? ? ? * ) , which launched in 2012 june and covers the 379kev bandpass , is the first focusing hard x - ray telescope in orbit .",
    "while it has a much smaller field of view than _ integral _ , it has much lower background and greatly improved sensitivity .",
    "thus , one of _ nustar _",
    "s science goals is to extend our view deeper into the galactic plane to look for hidden hard x - ray populations .",
    "during its first year of operation , _ nustar _ has initiated surveys of @xmath11 deg@xmath13 areas both in the galactic center ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) and in a region which samples the spiral arm population in order to probe potentially different environments where x - ray binaries are found .",
    "a spiral arm region centered on galactic coordinates of @xmath14 and @xmath15 was chosen for having the highest known density of ob star associations @xcite and hmxbs @xcite .",
    "this is part of the `` norma '' spiral arm region , which was identified early in the _ integral _ mission as having an unusually high density of hard x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the combination of active star formation and evidence that compact objects have already formed suggests that a survey by _ nustar _ may uncover compact objects associated with populations of massive stars such as magnetars or faint hmxbs that are early in their evolutionary process and may have neutron star or black hole accretors .",
    "the full surveys of the galactic center and the norma region will be carried out over a period of @xmath12 years ; here we report on the discovery of a transient source made during the first part of the survey . in the following ,  2 describes observations made with _",
    "nustar _ , _ swift _ , and _ chandra _ , as well as the procedures we used to reduce the data .",
    "the results are presented in  3 , and we discuss possibilities for the nature of the transient in  4 .",
    "as the first part of the _ nustar _ survey of the norma region , nine @xmath120ks _ nustar _ observations were performed between ut 2013 february 20 and february 24 .",
    "each @xmath16-by-@xmath16 field of view was partially overlapping with adjacent pointings , and the entire region covered was @xmath10.2 deg@xmath13 .",

    "they were reduced with the dedicated iraf package nfextern following the standard procedure  tailored for wide - field mosaics  which consists of bad pixel removal , dark subtraction , linearity correction , flatfielding and median sky subtraction .",
    "the resulting images were then flux - calibrated through relative photometry with the 2mass catalogue .",
    "we also obtained @xmath19-band imaging with the ohio - state infra - red imager / spectrometer ( osiris ) at the southern astrophysical research ( soar ) 4.1 m telescope .",

    "the scale on the bottom of the figure is in counts per pixel , and a logarithmic scaling is used .",
    "the apparent elongation of the source is due to the distorted psf shape at large off - axis angles .",
    "[ fig : nuimages ] ]    to determine the source position , we extracted all the events from a @xmath28-by-@xmath28 square region and made histograms of the counts , binning in the r.a . and",

    "we performed @xmath5 fitting of the histograms with a model consisting of a constant ( accounting for the flat background ) and a gaussian for the source .",
    "it should be noted that this is an approximation since the _ nustar _ point spread function ( psf ) is non - gaussian .",
    "we determined the centroids separately for fpma and fpmb , and they are consistent with each other .",
    "the weighted average of the two centroids is r.a.=@xmath29 , decl.=@xmath30 ( j2000.0 ) with 3-@xmath0 statistical uncertainties of @xmath31 and @xmath32 in r.a . and decl .",

    "after considering that the systematic pointing uncertainty for _ nustar _ is @xmath1@xmath33 @xcite , the error region can be approximated with a @xmath34-radius circle .",
    "we searched on - line catalogs ( e.g. , simbad ) for x - ray sources consistent with the position of nustar  j1634334738.7 , but we did not find any likely candidates .",
    "the catalog from the 2011 _ chandra _ survey ( fornasini et al . , submitted ) does not have any sources in the nustar  j1634334738.7 error region . based on this and the analysis described below ( including a re - analysis of the 2011 _ chandra _ observations ) ,",

    "the xrt 90% encircled energy radius is approximately @xmath35 , but we use @xmath24 to account for the uncertainty in the source position as nustar  j1634334738.7 is not bright enough in any of the _ swift _ observations to improve the measurement of the source position . as described above , we used a larger , circular region that does not contain any detected point sources for background . selecting the background regions for _ nustar",
    "_ requires some care because of scattered light from a nearby bright source ( 4u  163047 ) .",
    "the 310kev count rates or limits obtained for all observations are given in table  [ tab : obs ] .",
    "for _ nustar _ , the background rates are high enough to use gaussian statistics , and we use the poisson limits tabulated in @xcite for _ swift _ and _ chandra_. in all cases , we quote the 1-@xmath0 error bars if the minimum of the 1-@xmath0 error region is positive . otherwise , we give the 90% confidence upper limit . while the _ nustar _ observation taken on february 23 provides the only highly significant detection , the _ swift _ observation with the highest count rate is the one that occurred during this _ nustar _ observation . the only other possible evidence for activity from nustar  j1634334738.7 occurred on february 22 , when _ nustar _ obtained a 2.7-@xmath0 detection in fpma ; however , this is not confirmed by the fpmb data .    for _ chandra _ obsids 12529 and 12532 ( from 2011 ) and obsid 15625 ( from 2013 ) , we analyzed the acis data to search for a detection of nustar  j1634334738.7 .",
    "based on an inspection , no sources are apparent in the 0.310kev or 310kev images .",
    "the source is @xmath36 and @xmath37 from the _ chandra _ aimpoint for the 2011 obsids . at these off - axis angles , the 90% encircled energy fraction ( eef ) radii ( for 4.5kev photons )",
    "are @xmath38 and @xmath39 for obsids 12529 and 12532 , respectively .",
    "obsid 15625 was a dedicated pointing with the target on - axis , and the 90% eef radius is @xmath40 . for obsid 12529 , the largest number of 310kev counts within any @xmath38-radius circle inside the _ nustar _ error region is three , and , after accounting for background , we calculate a 90% confidence upper limit of @xmath41@xmath42s@xmath12 on the count rate ( see table  [ tab : obs ] ) . for obsid 12532 , the largest number of 310kev counts within any @xmath39-radius circle inside the _ nustar _ error region is two , and the count rate limit is @xmath41@xmath43s@xmath12 . for obsid 15625 ,",
    "the largest number of 310kev counts within a @xmath40-radius circle is two , and the count rate limit is @xmath41@xmath44s@xmath12 . this is higher than for the 2011 obsids because of the lower exposure time .",
    "we made _ nustar _ light curves for obsid 40014007001 with several different time binnings between 0.1s and 5500s ( the approximate satellite orbital period ) in the 310kev and 379kev bandpasses .",
    "the lack of any apparent variability in the 0.110s light curves rules out flares or bursts that might prove the presence of a neutron star .",
    "figure  [ fig : lc ] shows the 310kev orbit - by - orbit light curve for fpma and fpmb combined . at the 5500s binning , a @xmath5 test shows that the 310kev and 379kev light curves are consistent with the source being constant over @xmath140ks .",
    "next , we extracted _ nustar _ fpma and fpmb spectra for obsid 40014007001 and an xrt spectrum for obsid 00080508001 , which are the two observations with significant detections of nustar  j1634334738.7 .",
    "these were fitted jointly by minimizing the cash ( or @xmath45 ) statistic @xcite using the xspec software package .",
    "the statistical quality of the spectrum is low , and it is well fit by a power - law , a blackbody , or a thermal bremsstrahlung model . in all three cases , we included absorption using @xcite abundances and @xcite cross - sections .",
    "the parameters are given in table  [ tab : spectra ] , and the errors quoted are 90% confidence for one parameter of interest , @xmath46@xmath45 = 2.7 .",
    "although we used the @xmath45-statistic to determine the parameters , we also calculated the reduced-@xmath5 values , and they appear in table  [ tab : spectra ] .",
    "this quantity is slightly smaller for the power - law model ( @xmath47 for 8 degrees of freedom ) compared to the blackbody model ( @xmath48 for 8 dof ) and the bremsstrahlung model ( @xmath49 for 8 dof ) .",
    "however , given the small number of dof , the difference in @xmath50 is not significant , and the steeply falling power - law index ( @xmath2 ) suggests that the emission probably has a thermal origin . the spectrum for the blackbody model is shown in figure  [ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "we used the absorbed blackbody model and the count rates for _ nustar _ , _ swift _ , and _",
    "chandra _ given in table  [ tab : obs ] to calculate measurements or upper limits on the absorbed 310kev flux , and these flux histories are shown in figure  [ fig : lc_overview ] .",
    "we also calculated the flux upper limits for the _ chandra _ observations from 2011 .",
    "the upper limits on the absorbed 310kev fluxes are @xmath41@xmath51erg@xmath7s@xmath12 and @xmath41@xmath52erg@xmath7s@xmath12 for obsids 12529 and 12532 , respectively .",
    "although the count rate limits are considerably lower for these obsids compared to _",
    "obsid 15625 , the flux limits are similar because of the different effective areas for the acis - i and acis - s instruments .",
    "the lowest _ chandra _ upper limit indicates that the flux from this source changed by at least a factor of @xmath53 , suggesting that it is a transient rather than simply being a highly variable x - ray source .     confidence .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] ]    the _ nustar _ error circle includes dozens of near - ir candidate counterparts brighter than @xmath54 ( vega magnitude system ) . in the newfirm images from 2011 , the brightest source in the error circle ( 2mass  j163432884738393 ) has @xmath55 , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 , and the 2mass magnitudes are consistent , indicating a possible lack of variability on long time scales .",
    "the next two brightest sources are 2mass  j163433624738479 at @xmath58 and the _ spitzer_/glimpse source g336.7870 + 00.0111 at @xmath59 .",
    "these may be more likely counterparts to nustar  j1634334738.7 because they are relatively highly reddened ( @xmath60 and @xmath61 , respectively ) .",
    "however , we do not find any evidence that these sources are variable .",
    "for the two osiris @xmath19 images taken on april 3 and april 5 , we performed aperture photometry for all the sources within the _ nustar _ error circle , but did not find any variable sources .",
    "the high time - resolution of the _ nustar _ data allows for a search for a coherent signal with periods @xmath62ms , covering the range expected for either an isolated rotation - powered pulsar , a binary , or a magnetar . given the paucity of source counts in the observations listed in table  1 , we concentrate our attention on the obsid 40014007001 data .",
    "photon arrival times , adjusted for the _ nustar _ clock drift , were corrected to the solar system barycenter using jpl de200 ephemeris and the _ nustar _ derived source coordinates .",
    "we extracted photons in the 310kev band from a 30@xmath63-radius aperture centered on the source to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we searched for significant power from a coherent signal using an fft sampled at the nyquist frequency .",
    "the observation span was too short to consider the smearing of the pulse profile by spin - down of even the most highly energetic pulsar or the typical binary orbit period .",
    "the most significant signal found has a power of @xmath64 , corresponding to a probability of false detection of @xmath65 for @xmath66 fft search trials .",
    "we conclude that no pulsed x - ray signal is detected in from nustar  j1634334738.7 . after taking into account the local background , we place an upper limit on the pulse fraction at the 3-@xmath0 confidence level of @xmath67% for a blind search for a sinusoidal signal @xmath68ms .",

    "in considering the nature of nustar  j1634334738.7 , it is useful to estimate the x - ray luminosity that the source reached during its outburst .",
    "although the distance is highly uncertain , the strong absorption either indicates a large distance through a region of the galaxy with heavy extinction or absorption local to the source .",
    "the former is a strong possibility since the transient is in the direction of a region of the galactic plane that is crowded with h  ii / molecular cloud regions .",
    "nustar  j1634334738.7 is at @xmath69 , near a group of h  ii regions ( 336.732 + 0.072 , 336.840 + 0.047 , 336.90.1 , 337.1470.181 , and 337.30.1 ) at a distance of @xmath70kpc @xcite .",
    "if the absorption is interstellar , then nustar  j1634334738.7 is very likely beyond or in these molecular clouds , indicating a 210kev unabsorbed luminosity limit of @xmath10@xmath71erg  s@xmath12 for the blackbody spectrum and @xmath10@xmath72erg  s@xmath12 for bremsstrahlung . in the following ,",
    "we consider both possibilities : a distance of @xmath111kpc and a peak luminosity of @xmath1@xmath11erg  s@xmath12 ; and a smaller distance with absorption local to the source and a lower luminosity .    considering the first possibility , a luminosity as high as @xmath11erg  s@xmath12 would be unprecedented for at least two common types of x - ray sources in the galaxy .",
    "non - magnetic cvs have strong optical outbursts along with persistent and transient x - ray emission .",
    "however , extensive studies have shown that their x - ray luminosities are in the @xmath73erg  s@xmath12 range @xcite .",
    "while magnetic cvs can reach higher luminosities @xcite , they do not typically show outbursts .",
    "secondly , active binaries , including rs  cvn systems and low - mass flare stars , produce x - ray flares , some of which can last for about a day .",
    "superflares that peak at x - ray luminosities of @xmath74erg  s@xmath12 have been seen @xcite , and there have been flares that have released @xmath75@xmath76erg @xcite . if nustar  j1634334738.7 is at @xmath111kpc , then in addition to having a higher peak luminosity , the energy released is @xmath75@xmath77erg , which is based on the source being at its peak luminosity for @xmath7540ks ( see figure  [ fig : lc ] ) . in summary , while we do not rule out the active binary possibility ( and see below for further discussion on this topic ) , at the 11kpc distance , the event seen by _",
    "nustar _ would need to be extreme for this explanation to be correct .",
    "a source type that might be a good match to the nustar  j1634334738.7 properties is the class of highly magnetic isolated neutron stars : magnetars .",
    "while these sources are best known for their very bright and brief ( @xmath10.1s ) x - ray and gamma - ray flares , they also have persistent but variable emission that can easily reach @xmath11erg  s@xmath12 or higher @xcite .",
    "the x - ray spectrum of their persistent emission is dominated by a @xmath10.51kev blackbody @xcite .",
    "furthermore , as mentioned in  1 , magnetars are associated with regions where high - mass star formation is occurring , such as the norma region , and there is a known magnetar , sgr  162741 , that is @xmath10.2@xmath78 from nustar  j1634334738.7 .",
    "however , one possible counter - argument to the magnetar hypothesis is that magnetar periods of activity usually last for months . from figure",
    "[ fig : lc_overview ] , the peak activity from nustar  j1634334738.7 could not have lasted for more than @xmath11.5days based on the _ swift _ upper limits , and _",
    "chandra _ and _ nustar _ place a tight upper limit on activity @xmath13 weeks after the _ nustar _ detection . while we do not detect pulsations or @xmath10.1s flares , which would prove that the source is a magnetar , the pulsation search is limited by the statistical quality of the data , and flaring episodes are relatively rare .",
    "a blackbody spectrum could also be produced from an optically thick accretion disk in a black hole binary .",
    "most often , such sources show temperatures of @xmath11kev in the inner parts of their accretion disks when they are at high luminosity @xmath75@xmath79erg  s@xmath12 , which would require a very large distance of @xmath75100300kpc for nustar  j1634334738.7 .",
    "two sources ( grs  1758258 and 1e  1740.72942 ) have shown fainter soft states , but their blackbody spectra have been at temperatures of 0.4kev @xcite and 0.7kev @xcite , which are lower than the 1.2kev we see for nustar  j1634334738.7 . also , transient black hole binaries typically have outbursts that last for several months , which is very different from nustar  j1634334738.7 .    considering the second possibility that the source is closer than @xmath111kpc , then the high column density must be due to material local to the source . in fact ,",
    "_ integral _ has found a large number of obscured hmxbs that have column densities of @xmath80@xmath7 due to the wind from their supergiant companions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . while many of the sources in this class are persistent , the supergiant fast x - ray transients ( sfxts ) , which have some members that are also obscured hmxbs , have outbursts that can be as short as a few hours , and it would not be unusual for an sfxt to produce x - ray emission that lasts for half a day @xcite .",
    "however , a possible problem for this interpretation is that the spectrum of nustar  j1634334738.7 is softer than usually seen for active sfxts . during flares ,",
    "igr  j175442619 and igr  j164794514 show a power - law spectrum with a photon index near @xmath81 @xcite .",
    "somewhat softer spectra with @xmath822.4 can be seen during periods of weaker activity , but their spectra are only as soft as nustar  j1634334738.7 when they are in quiescence .    for cvs and active binaries , the challenge is to explain a column density as high as we measure with absorption local to the systems .",
    "one possibility is that material expelled from the system ( either related to the evolutionary state of the stellar component or related to the x - ray flaring event ) could cause increased column density .",
    "however , for one active binary ( ax ari ) , the column density was seen to increase to @xmath83@xmath7 during an event @xcite , which is 23 orders of magnitude less than is required for nustar  j1634334738.7 .",
    "variation in optical brightness of some stars has also been attributed to ejection of material from the stars .",
    "an example of this is a change of 0.5 magnitudes in the optical seen for ku cyg @xcite .",
    "however , this would translate into a column density near @xmath84@xmath7 , which is still far less than is required .",
    "the near - ir information that we have provides only weak constraints on the source type .",
    "given that we were not able to identify the counterpart , we can only say that the source must be fainter ( before and after the x - ray flare ) than the brightest source in the error circle ( 2mass  j163432884738393 ) .",
    "this corresponds to @xmath85 , @xmath86 , and @xmath87 , and these values are consistent with all the possibilities for the source type discussed above .",
    "however , in the scenario where nustar  j1634334738.7 is a nearby source with local absorption , these limits do provide some constraint .",
    "for example , a very nearby and luminous obscured hmxb is ruled out .    in summary ,",
    "nustar  j1634334738.7 is a fast x - ray transient , which has a thermal spectrum with relatively high temperature ( @xmath88kev for a blackbody or 3.0kev for bremsstrahlung ) .",
    "if its high column density is due to interstellar material , the source is probably distant ( @xmath7511kpc ) , making the peak luminosity @xmath75@xmath11ergs@xmath12 .",
    "we discuss the origin of the flare and suggest that the most likely possibilities if the source is distant are an unusually bright flare from an active binary or a short outburst from a magnetar .",
    "we also consider the possibility that the source is closer and that the absorption is local to the source .",

    "<S> during hard x - ray observations of the norma spiral arm region by the _ nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) _ in 2013 february , a new transient source , nustar  j1634334738.7 , was detected at a significance level of 8-@xmath0 in the 310kev bandpass . </S>",
    "<S> the source is consistent with having a constant _ nustar _ count rate over a period of 40ks and is also detected simultaneously by _ swift _ at lower significance . </S>",
    "<S> the source is not significantly detected by _ </S>",

    "<S> chandra _ in the days before or weeks after the discovery of the transient , indicating that the strong x - ray activity lasted for between @xmath10.5 and 1.5 days . </S>",
    "<S> near - ir imaging observations were carried out before and after the x - ray activity , but we are not able to identify the counterpart . the combined _ nustar _ and _ swift _ energy spectrum is consistent with a power - law with a photon index of @xmath2 ( 90% confidence errors ) , a blackbody with @xmath3kev , or a bremsstrahlung model with @xmath4kev . </S>",
    "<S> the reduced-@xmath5 values for the three models are not significantly different , ranging from 1.23 to 1.44 for 8 degrees of freedom . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum is strongly absorbed with @xmath6@xmath7 , @xmath8@xmath7 , and @xmath9@xmath7 , for the power - law , blackbody , and bremsstrahlung models , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> although the high column density could be due to material local to the source , it is consistent with absorption from interstellar material along the line of sight at a distance of 11kpc , which would indicate an x - ray luminosity @xmath10@xmath11erg  s@xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> although we do not reach a definitive determination of the nature of nustar  j1634334738.7 , we suggest that it may be an unusually bright active binary or a magnetar . </S>"
