    "networks have attracted a burst of attention in the last decade ( useful reviews include refs .",
    "@xcite ) , with applications to natural , social , and technological networks . within biology , networks are prevalent , including : neural networks , where synapses link neurons ; metabolic networks , describing metabolic processes in the cell , linking chemical reactions and the regulatory processes that control them ; protein interaction networks , representing physical interactions between an organism s proteins ; transcription networks , describing regulatory interactions between different genes ; food webs , using links to characterize who eats whom ; and networks of sexual relations and infections , including aids models .",
    "taking a broader view , networks seem to be everywhere !",
    "there are : electrical power grids , whose stability relates to the network structure ; airline networks , with service efficiency tied to properties of the network ; the world wide web , with search engines using the network links to locate pages ; networks in linguistics , with words linked by co - occurrence ; social networks of all sorts @xcite ; collaboration networks , describing joint works amongst actors , authors , research labs ,  ; and many more .    of great current interest is the identification of community groups , or modules , within networks .",
    "stated informally , a community group is a portion of the network whose members are more tightly linked to one another than to other members of the network .",
    "a variety of approaches @xcite have been taken to explore this concept ; see refs .",
    "@xcite for useful reviews .",
    "detecting community groups allows quantitative investigation of relevant subnetworks .",
    "properties of the subnetworks may differ from the aggregate properties of the network as a whole , e.g. , modules in the world wide web are sets of topically related web pages .",
    "methods for identifying community groups can be specialized to distinct classes of networks , such as bipartite networks @xcite .",
    "the nodes in a bipartite network can be partitioned into two disjoint sets such that no two nodes within the same set are adjacent .",
    "bipartite networks thus feature two distinct types of nodes , providing a natural representation for many affiliation or interaction networks , with one type of node representing actors and the other representing relations .",
    "examples of actor - relation pairs include people attending events @xcite , court justices making decisions @xcite , scientists jointly publishing articles @xcite , organizations collaborating in projects @xcite , and legislators serving on committees @xcite . arguably , bipartite networks are the empirically standard case for social networks and other interaction networks , with unipartite networks appearing  often implicitly  as projections .",
    "we formally describe networks using the language of graph theory .",
    "let @xmath0 be a set of vertices and @xmath1 be a set of vertex pairs or edges from @xmath2 .",
    "the pair @xmath3 is called a graph . in a simple graph , all",
    "pairs @xmath4 are distinct and @xmath5 , i.e. , there are no double lines or loops . given a partition @xmath6 where no edges exist between pairs of points within @xmath7 , @xmath8 or @xmath9 , then @xmath10 is said to be bipartite .",
    "we shall consider simple graphs on a ( large ) finite set @xmath0 : @xmath11 the number of edges or degree @xmath12 of vertex @xmath13 is defined by @xmath14 the number of edges is @xmath15 @xmath16 is often called the volume of the graph @xmath17 .",
    "graph structure is encoded in the adjacency matrix @xmath18 with @xmath19      detecting community groups allows for the identification and quantitative investigation of relevant subnetworks .",
    "local properties of the community groups may differ from the global properties of the complete network .",
    "for example , topically related web pages in the world wide web are typically interlinked , so that the contents of pages in distinct community groups should reveal distinct themes .",
    "thus , identification of community groups within a network is a first step towards understanding the heterogeneous substructures of the network .    to identify communities ,",
    "we take as our starting point the modularity , introduced by @xcite .",
    "modularity makes intuitive notions of community groups precise by comparing network edges to those of a null model . as noted by @xcite :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a good division of a network into communities is not merely one in which there are few edges between communities ; it is one in which there are fewer than expected edges between communities . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    the modularity  @xmath20 is  up to a normalization constant  the number of edges within communities @xmath21 minus those for a null model : @xmath22    along with , it is necessary to provide a null model , defining @xmath23 .",
    "the standard choice for the null model constrains the degree distribution for the vertices to match the degree distribution in the actual network .",
    "random graph models of this sort are obtained @xcite by putting an edge between vertices @xmath24 and @xmath25 at random , with the constraint that on average the degree of any vertex @xmath24 is @xmath26 .",
    "this constrains the expected adjacency matrix such that @xmath27 denote @xmath28 by @xmath23 and assume further that @xmath29 factorizes into @xmath30 leading to @xmath31 a consequence of the null model choice is that @xmath32 when all vertices are in the same community .",
    "the goal now is to find a division of the vertices into communities such that the modularity @xmath33 is maximal .",
    "an exhaustive search for a decomposition is out of the question : even for moderately large graphs there are far too many ways to decompose them into communities",
    ". fast approximate algorithms do exist ( see , for example , refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "specific classes of networks have additional constraints that can be reflected in the null model . for bipartite graphs ,",
    "the null model should be modified to reproduce the characteristic form of bipartite adjacency matrices @xmath34 } {      \\begin{array}{cc }          { { \\mathbf{o } } } & { { \\mathbf{m}}}\\\\          { { { \\mathbf{m}}}^\\mathrm{t } } & { { \\mathbf{o}}}\\end{array } } }      { { \\quad}.}\\label{eq : bipartsubstructure}\\ ] ] recently , specialized modularity measures and search algorithms have been proposed for finding communities in bipartite networks @xcite .",
    "we make use of the algorithm called brim : bipartite , recursively induced modules @xcite . starting from a ( more or less ) ad hoc partition of the vertices of type 1 ,",
    "it is straightforward to optimize a corresponding decomposition of the vertices of type 2 .",
    "from there , optimize the decomposition of vertices of type 1 , and iterate .",
    "in this fashion , modularity increases until a ( local ) maximum is reached . however , the question remains : is the maximum a `` good '' one ? at this level then a random search is called for , varying the composition and number of communities , with the goal of reaching a better maximum after a new round of hill climbing using the brimalgorithm .",
    "in the ongoing research project nemo @xcite , networks of research and development collaborations under eu framework programs fp1 , fp2 ,  , fp5 are studied . the collaborations in the framework programs give rise to bipartite graphs , with edges existing between projects and the organizations which take part in them . with this construction ,",
    "participating organizations are linked only through joint projects .    in the various framework programs ,",
    "the number of organizations ranges from 2,000 to 20,000 , the number of projects ranges from 3,000 to 15,000 , and the number of links between them ( project participations ) ranges from 10,000 to 250,000 ( see for precise values ) .",
    "a popular approach in social network analysis  where networks are often small , consisting of a few dozen nodes  is to visualize the networks and identify community groups by eye .",
    "however , the framework program networks are much larger : can we `` see '' the community groups in these networks ?",
    "structural differences or similarities of such networks are not obvious at a glance . for a graphical representation of the organizations and/or projects by dots on an a4 sheet of paper , we would have to put these dots at a distance of about @xmath35 from each other , and we then still would not have drawn the links ( collaborations ) which connect them .",
    "previous studies used a list of coarse graining recipes to compact the networks into a form which would lend itself to a graphical representation @xcite .",
    "as an alternative we have attempted to detect communities just using brim , i.e. , purely on the basis of relational network structure , and blind with respect to any additional information about the nature of agents .    in , we show a community structure for fp3 found using the brimalgorithm , with a modularity of @xmath36 for 14 community groups .",
    "the communities are shown as vertices in a network , with the vertex positions determined using spectral methods @xcite .",
    "the area of each vertex is proportional to the number of edges from the original network within the corresponding community .",
    "the width of each edge in the community network is proportional to the number of edges in the original network connecting community members from the two linked groups .",
    "the vertices and edges are shaded to provide additional information about their topical structure , as described in the next section .",
    "each community is labeled with the most frequently occurring subject index .",
    "we denote by @xmath37 the frequency of occurrence of the subject index @xmath38 in the network , with @xmath39 similarly we consider the projects within one community @xmath21 and the frequency @xmath40 of any subject index @xmath41 appearing in the projects only of that community .",
    "we call @xmath42 the topical profile of community @xmath21 to be compared with that of the network as a whole",
    ".    topical differentiation of communities can be measured by comparing their profiles , among each other or with respect to the overall network .",
    "this can be done in a variety of ways @xcite , such as by the kullback `` distance '' @xmath43 a true metric is given by @xmath44 ranging from zero to two .",
    "topical differentiation is illustrated in . in the figure ,",
    "example profiles are shown , taken from the network in .",
    "the community - specific profile corresponds to the community labeled ` 11 .",
    "food' in . based on the most frequently occurring subject indices_agriculture _ , _ food _ , and _ resources of the seas ,",
    "fisheries_the community consists of projects and organizations focussed on r&drelated to food products .",
    "the topical differentiation is @xmath45 for the community shown .     for a specific community ( dark bars ) and the overall profile @xmath46 for the network as a whole ( light bars ) .",
    "the community - specific profile shown is for the community labeled `` 11 .",
    "food '' in .",
    "the community has @xmath45 . ]      for further analysis , we have also looked for communities in networks of projects and subject indices . here",
    ", the projects and subject indices constitute the vertices of a bipartite network , with edges existing between projects and the subject indices assigned to them .",
    "this construction disregards the organizations , providing an alternate approach to investigating the topical structure of the framework programs .",
    "the later framework programs , such as fp5 , show a fair degree of overlap between the communities , due to the subject indices being freely assigned in project applications .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the networks for the first three framework programs , where topics were attributed rigidly within thematic subprograms .",
    "the communities for fp13 thus have more clearly segregated community structures .",
    "fp1 is particularly extreme , having _ no _ overlaps between the communities .",
    "the differences between framework programs point to the need for some care in interpreting community structures : the communities in fp13 reflect policy structures while those found for later framework programs are more representative of interaction patterns .",
    "compute the mutual information @xmath52 and normalize @xmath53 where the entropy @xmath54 is @xmath55 with the definitions in , @xmath56 ranges from zero , for uncorrelated decompositions of the set , to one , for perfectly correlated decompositions .    using the brimalgorithm , we have partitioned network vertices into community groups by maximizing the modularity @xmath20 . in principle",
    ", many dissimilar partitions of the vertices could produce similar modularity values . with the normalized mutual information ( or a similar measure )",
    ", we can assess the amount of shared structure between two different partitions of the vertex set .",
    "for example , in we have shown a decomposition of the network of projects and subject indices for fp5 . in",
    ", we show a second decomposition of the same network .",
    "the modularity is nearly identical@xmath57 instead of the @xmath47 seen previously  and the decompositions have some visible similarities . however , there are also definite structural differences , most prominently that the second decomposition has only eight communities while the first has nine .",
    "are the structural differences significant ?",
    "the normalized mutual information is found to be @xmath58 , indicating a strong correlation between the two decompositions and demonstrating that they have relatively minor structural differences .",
    "we have successfully identified community groups in networks defined from the framework program projects and the subject indices assigned to them .",
    "the full networks defined from the projects and the organizations taking part in them are considerably larger and correspondingly more challenging to investigate . for the full organizations - projects network ,",
    "the brimhill climbing algorithm is being supplemented with an aggressive , probabilistic search through community configurations upon which brimacts .",
    "this extended search has only just begun , but preliminary results are encouraging .",
    "once established , communities will then be investigated with regard to their internal structure , with the goal of identifying correlated properties within communities and contrasting properties across communities .",
    "we expect the analysis of internal structure to reveal patterns , themes , and motivations of collaborative research and development in the european union .",
