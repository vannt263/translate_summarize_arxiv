    "in the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) picture of galaxy formation , gas falling into dark matter halos is shock - heated approximately to the halo virial temperature , @xmath5 maintaining quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium with the dark matter component . @xcite .",
    "the gas will cool , losing its pressure support , and settling into a centrifugally supported disk while conserving its specific angular momentum @xcite .",
    "however , recently @xcite showed using one - dimensional models that galaxy halos can only shock - heat infalling gas if the cooling rate for gas behind the shock is lower than the compression rate of the infalling gas .",
    "this criterion translates to a roughly redshift independent critical minimum mass for halos that are able to shock - heat the infalling gas of @xmath6 .",
    "less massive halos are not able to support stable shocks and the majority of their gas is accreted cold .",
    "however , in the general three - dimensional case galaxies above the critical shock mass can also be fed with cold gas along filaments penetrating deep inside the hot halo @xcite .",
    "recent simulations also predict that the baryonic growth of most galaxies is dominated by smooth accretion events of either hot or cold gas , as opposed to individual merger events @xcite .",
    "observations of massive star - forming galaxies at @xmath7 have found a preponderance for thick gas - rich rotating disks with large turbulent motions and only a minority of major mergers @xcite .",
    "the observed high - redshift disks exhibit large turbulent motions that could potentially be the result of gravitational energy release from cold accretion flows feeding the galaxy @xcite .",
    "given the bimodal temperature distribution of the accreted gas and the characteristic mass scale of @xmath8 , it is tempting to link this to the observed bimodality in the galaxy population dividing them into a red and blue sequence with a critical stellar mass of @xmath9 , which was revealed in recent large galaxy surveys ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "galaxies below this critical mass are typically blue , star - forming disk galaxies , whereas galaxies above @xmath10 are dominated by red spheroidal systems with old stellar populations .",
    "the observed bimodality can be explained if star formation in halos above a critical threshold mass of @xmath11 is suppressed ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the quenching mechanism needs to be both energetic enough to trigger the quenching and long - lasting enough to maintain the quenching over a hubble time .",
    "in addition to the quenching by shock - heated gas above a critical halo mass @xcite , potential quenching mechanisms include the feedback from agns @xcite , gaseous major mergers triggering star burst and/or quasar activity ( e.g @xcite ) and gravitational quenching by clumpy accretion @xcite .",
    "environmental effects and the input of gravitational energy from infalling clumps are real and automatically included in high - resolution numerical simulations . in semi - analytic models",
    "these environmental effects are not usually included ( see , however , @xcite for an exception . )    in this letter we study in detail the thermal formation history of a set of very high resolution cosmological re - simulations of individual galaxies . in an earlier paper ( @xcite , hereafter n07 ) we showed that the simulated galaxies reproduce a number of observed properties of elliptical galaxies , although the simulations include neither stellar nor agn feedback .",
    "we show that the gas is heated and kept hot by gravitational feedback , efficiently terminating star formation and leading to the formation of systems with evolved stellar populations and low star formation rates by @xmath4 .",
    "gravitational feedback comes in many forms .",
    "incoming lumps or streams of cold gas ultimately come to rest depositing their potential energy frictionally ( i.e. through decaying turbulence ) .",
    "supersonic collisions of infalling gas with the ambient gas lead to propagating shock waves @xcite which also deposit entropy throughout the system",
    ". gradual accretion to the gaseous envelope of the galaxy adds weight , causing contraction and @xmath12 work on the ambient gas . and finally infalling satellite systems captured through dynamical friction cause gaseous wakes from which energy is transferred to the surrounding gas @xcite .",
    "these are all variants of the processes by which gravitational energy released by infalling matter can be transferred to the gas maintained in quasi - hydrostatic equilibrium within galaxies , heating it and tending to counteract radiative losses .",
    "the @xmath13cdm initial conditions assume scale - invariant adiabatic fluctuations with @xmath14 @xcite . throughout this letter",

    "the particle number of the gas and dark matter particles was increased to @xmath23 ( halos a1 , c and e ) and @xmath24 ( halo a2 ) within a cubic volume at redshift @xmath25 containing all the particles that ended up within the virialized region of the halos at @xmath1 .",
    "the virial properties of the galaxies at @xmath1 are summarized in table [ gal_prop ] .",
    "the simulations were performed using the treesph - code gadget-2 @xcite on shared - memory machines hosted in cambridge , munich and princeton .",
    "the code includes star formation and optically thin radiative cooling for a primordial composition of hydrogen and helium @xcite .",
    "we included a spatially uniform redshift - dependent uv background radiation field with a modified @xcite spectrum .",
    "we modify the self - regulated feedback model of @xcite by turning off the feedback from supernovae , eliminating the two - phase description of the ism of star - forming particles with @xmath26 @xcite , and thus transforming their entire gas component into the cold phase with a pre - set temperature of @xmath27 .",
    "the star formation time scale is set by @xmath28 , where we set the free parameters to @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "the gravitational softening length for the @xmath31 ( @xmath32 ) runs was fixed in comoving units of @xmath33 and @xmath34 until @xmath35 , after which the softening remained fixed in physical coordinates at the same values .",

    "the available low entropy gas has been consumed by star formation and we are primarily left with dilute shock - heated gas with cooling times of the order of @xmath57 .",
    "at high redshifts @xmath58 the gas flows into the galaxies predominantly in the cold phase with the hot gas ( defined as @xmath59 ) fraction being low at @xmath60 .",
    "a large fraction of the gas can also be found in the cold star - forming phase .",
    "with decreasing redshift the fraction of hot gas steadily increases ; by @xmath61 the hot gas fraction is around @xmath62 .",
    "the transition from a cold gas accretion mode to a hot gas dominated accretion mode occurs at @xmath63 , corresponding to halo masses of @xmath64 in good agreement with the predictions of @xcite , see also @xcite . below these redshifts",
    "the galaxy halos are massive enough to support stable shocks and most of the accreted gas is shock - heated close to the virial temperature of the halos .",
    "as this transition is mass - dependent , it occurs somewhat earlier in the more massive halo a1 , compared to the slightly lower mass halos c and e. at @xmath1 the hot gas fraction is @xmath65 , with only some residual cold star - forming gas remaining , as most of the original gas has either formed stars or been shock - heated to high temperatures .",
    "the diffuse gas is heated by gravitational feedback in the form of gravitational energy release from infalling stellar and gaseous clumps .",

    "the @xmath69 reflects the overall mass growth and deepening of the potential well , whereas @xmath70 describes the release of gravitational energy from accreted structures .",
    "all of the energy released by the growth of the potential energy of the accreted stars @xmath71 goes into heating the gas and moving outwards dark matter and previous generations of stars ( on average @xmath72 of the released energy ends up as kinetic energy of the stars ) , whereas much of the energy release associated with the potential energy growth of the in situ stars is radiated away .",
    "all galaxies assemble rapidly at high redshifts @xmath73 with @xmath74 of both the in situ and accreted stars increasing by an order of magnitude . the change in the accreted @xmath75 mirrors the mass accretion history of the galaxies with the 3:1 merger for galaxy c at z=0.6 and the nearly 1:1 merger for galaxy e at z=1.5 clearly visible ( see fig 7 . in n07 for details ) . at @xmath76",
    "the integrated change in the potential energy is dominated by accreted stars for halos a1,c , a2 ( dissipationless formation ) and in situ stars for halo e ( dissipational formation ) , with the binding energy / atom increasing by @xmath77 from @xmath78 to @xmath1.the @xmath75 is 2 - 3 larger compared to @xmath79 for halos a1,c and a2 at @xmath76 , whereas halo e is dominated by in situ star formation and @xmath79 is a factor of four larger than @xmath75 .",
    "we expect gravitational feedback effects to be important in the galaxies assembled through dissipationless processes ( a1,c , a2 ) , whereas gravitational feedback plays a minor role in the dissipational formation of galaxy e. we also see a trend with increasing resolution , the final @xmath75 of halo a2 is higher by 50% , whereas the @xmath79 is lower by 30% compared to halo a1 .",
    "thus we expect stronger gravitational feedback effects with increasing resolution as we are able to resolve smaller structures .",

    "we quantify this effect by studying the terms of the entropy equation of gadget-2 for a given particle @xmath89 @xcite , @xmath90 here the first term depicts the external radiative cooling ( or heating ) of the gas and the second term gives the generation of entropy by artificial viscosity in shocks and where the internal energy is defined as @xmath91 . in fig .",

    "the shock - induced heating rate of the diffuse gas is larger at all redshifts compared to the cooling rate",
    ". at large redshifts a substantial fraction of the gas ( @xmath95 at @xmath96 ) and ( @xmath97 at @xmath0 ) is starforming , whereas at @xmath98 this fraction is below a few percent . at @xmath98",
    "the energy input from gravitational feedback is able to keep the gas hot in the galaxies forming dissipationlessly ( a1,c , a2 ) , whereas the dissipationally forming galaxy e exhibits much lower heating rates at @xmath78 .",
    "in addition to heating the gas the gravitational feedback heats the dark matter ( dm ) of the galaxies causing it to expand outwards .",
    "we quantify this effect in fig .",
    "[ masscumu_dm ] , where we plot the central dm mass within @xmath99 in our four galaxies ( circles ) as a function of lookback time .",
    "the employed gravitational softening @xmath100 is a plummer equivalent spline softening length , for which the force is exactly newtonian beyond @xmath101 .",
    "thus @xmath99 is resolved by @xmath102 , which should be sufficient to follow the dm mass evolution reliably .    in the galaxies that form dissipationlessly we see an initial increase in the central dm due to adiabatic contraction .",
    "after a peak dm mass at @xmath0 the central dm mass steadily declines due to heating from infalling clumps , with the final central dm mass being a factor of 2 lower for galaxies a1,a2 and 50% lower for galaxy c. in contrast galaxy e shows a constant evolution of the central dm mass , with the z=0 and z=3 central dm masses being roughly the same .",
    "we also plot for comparison the central dm of a pure dm only simulation of halo a2 at @xmath32 resolution ( red squares ) . for the pdm simulation",
    "we see neither the adiabatic contraction phase nor the pushing out of dm , thus resulting in a constant central dm mass throughout the simulation .",
    "this has important implications for the recent estimates of central dark matter content of elliptical galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "the gravitational energy release from infalling clumps might help in transforming an initially cuspy dm profile to a cored profile as seen in our simulations ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , once a cored dm profile with a hot low - density gas halo is in place , it can be maintained through the infall of cold gas clouds even without the inclusion of additional feedback sources @xcite .",
    "finally , the accretion of minor mergers can potentially explain the strong size evolution observed in elliptical galaxies between @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "in this letter we have studied the formation history of four galaxies that reproduce a number of the observed properties for elliptical galaxies .",
    "we have shown that for three galaxies ( a1,c , a2 ) for which the late formation @xmath2 is dominated by dissipationless minor merging that the energy release from gravitational feedback alone is sufficient to make these galaxies red and dead by @xmath78 , the fourth galaxy ( e ) has a dissipational formation history with significant ongoing star formation at low redshifts .",
    "stellar and agn feedback are both real and important , especially in driving winds and outflows that enrich the intergalactic medium with metals ( e.g. @xcite ) and potentially in determining the lower and upper cutoffs in the observed galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the baryon / dm fraction in our simulated galaxies is a factor of two too high for their mass compared to predictions from recent lensing data @xcite .",
    "however , in order to isolate the effects of gravitational heating from infalling clumps , which would occur even if there were neither stellar nor agn feedback , we chose to run our simulations without any additional energy feedback .",
    "the efficiency of gravitational feedback can be estimated using the following simple argument , @xmath104 where the final change in potential energy results from integrating from @xmath42 to a fiducial infall radius @xmath105 .",
    "gravitational feedback energy @xmath106 resulting in @xmath107 where @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the circular velocity in units of 300 km / s . inserting the values for galaxy a1 at @xmath1 ( @xmath110 and @xmath111 ) into eq .",
    "[ eq_grav_heat_val ] results in @xmath112 which is remarkably similar to the values that can be read off fig .",
    "[ grav_energy ] .",
    "more importantly , this energy is of the same order as the feedback energy from supernova ii @xmath113 ( for a salpeter imf and @xmath114 ergs per supernova ) and agn feedback energy @xmath115 ( for @xmath116 and a total agn feedback efficiency of 0.5% ) .",
    "however , unlike snii and agn feedback energy , gravitational feedback energy scales with @xmath117 , making it proportionally more important in massive systems with large circular velocities .",
    "furthermore , the energy released from gravitational feedback is distributed throughout the galaxy halo , whereas the feedback energy from snii and agn feedback is confined to the central region of the halo in regions with high density cold gas that can efficiently radiate away the energy .",
    "the process presented here is general , but in detail might depend on the implementation of additional feedback .",
    "the inclusion of supernova feedback might be important in lowering the number of stellar clumps thus decreasing the amount of gravitational feedback in the system .",
    "another important factor not included in our simulations is metal cooling that is expected to increase the cooling rates by a factor of ten or more .",
    "however , the increased cooling rates might to some extent be counteracted by efficient stellar and agn feedback , especially in the central regions of the galaxies .",
    "finally , the derived heating rates at the peak of the gravitational feedback phase ( @xmath78 in fig . [ rates ] ) are typically 15 - 20 times higher than the cooling rate of gas with primordial composition and thus gravitational feedback energy is expected to be an important energy source in the dissipationless formation process of all massive galaxies ."
