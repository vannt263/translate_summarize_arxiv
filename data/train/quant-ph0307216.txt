    "for many applications , both in classical and quantum optics , it is a good idea to focus light to a small spot size .",
    "for example , in recent experiments on single atoms trapped in tiny dipole traps @xcite the focusing system plays a major role .",
    "a natural question in that context is , how strong can the interaction between a single atom in free space and a light wave be ?",
    "one expects the strength of the interaction to increase with decreasing focal spot size .",
    "however , there must be an upper limit to the interaction strength for at least two reasons : first , there is a limit to how much one can focus light of a given wavelength @xmath1 ; second , the cross section of a two - level atom is @xmath2 , which seems to indicate that as long as all light is focused to within @xmath3 the interaction is optimal . the latter argument , however , does not paint the complete picture .",
    "first of all , it leaves out polarization effects , and second it does not distinguish between a classical object with a cross section @xmath3 ( such as a classical oscillating dipole @xcite ) and a quantum object with the same cross section ( such as a @xmath4 to @xmath5 transition in an atom ) . here",
    "we take a closer theoretical look at the resonant interaction of a two - level atom with strongly focused light .    to start with earlier theoretical work , in refs .",
    "@xcite a standard quantum - optical version of input - output theory ( see @xcite , and also @xcite ) was used to calculate the effects of light scattering off of a single atom in free space .",
    "the description of the light waves in the model has a 1-dimensional character but one may expect a full 3-dimensional calculation to be necessary if the incoming light is strongly focused . here",
    "we show how the input - output theory can be rephrased to include the full 3-dimensional description of the input and output light beams and yet keep all characteristics of the simpler 1-dimensional model .    in other work @xcite on the same subject exact 3-dimensional solutions of the maxwell equations",
    "were constructed by expanding the field in a complete set of functions that are well - suited to describe a cylindrically symmetric beam . in the present paper",
    "we use a different method , and apply the results of refs .",
    "@xcite , where the standard debye approximation is used to construct exact expressions for strongly focused light beams .",
    "the authors find that a radially polarized beam of light produces a field that is longitudinally polarized in the focal spot and that is focused down to a very small spot size , namely @xmath6 .",
    "it is worth noting that this area is smaller than @xmath3 by almost a factor of 5 .",
    "one may wonder what the strongest focusing possible is .",
    "it turns out that that depends on one s definition .",
    "the smallest spot size is one criterion , but another , which is the most relevant for our discussion , is to find the maximum possible electric field intensity in the origin given a fixed power for an incoming beam . that maximum is known to be achieved by an electric dipole wave @xcite . for illumination with a finite numerical aperture",
    "one still obtains the maximum by an electric dipole wave , but the optimum then depends on the polarization , see @xcite and also section v. in any case , a measure of how focused a given light beam is , is thus given by its overlap with the appropriate dipole wave .",
    "furthermore , for the interaction of light with an atom in the usual long - wavelength approximation @xcite , one may expand the interaction in a multipole series .",
    "to lowest order , the atom interacts through an electric dipole interaction ; hence , to lowest order the only types of waves interacting with the atom are , again , electric dipole waves .",
    "thus , it makes sense for two reasons to expand the field in multipole waves around the origin ( which is where the atom is assumed to be ) .",
    "in addition , we note here that a multipole expansion is also convenient for the calculation of the field distribution in the focal region @xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we review the essential properties of multipole waves , and in section iii we consider the interaction of an atom with a field expanded in multipole waves . in section iv we calculate two characteristic quantities of the scattered light as functions of the location of the photodetector : one is the intensity pattern and one is the photon statistics .",
    "the former quantity is classical in some sense , as a quantum object never gives rise to an intensity pattern that can not be also obtained from the maxwell equations and a classical scatterer .",
    "the photon statistics , on the other hand , does provide a quantum signature of the scattering process . in section",
    "v we consider the ( longitudinally polarized ) focused light beams discussed in @xcite and calculate their overlap with the appropriate dipole wave .",
    "we compare the results to similar known results on transversely polarized waves .",
    "we conclude by raising several open questions concerning various aspects of focused light that are not treated in the main text .",
    "when quantizing the electromagnetic ( em ) field , we may choose any complete set of mode functions to expand the electric and magnetic fields in .",
    "the usual choice is to take plane waves , but , as mentioned above , for the description of the interaction of radiation with atoms in the dipole approximation multipole waves @xcite are a good alternative .",
    "multipole waves are eigenfunctions of commuting hermitian operators such that the excitations of such modes ( i.e. , the photons ) possess definite amounts of energy @xmath7 @xmath8 $ ] , total angular momentum @xmath9 @xmath10 $ ] , angular momentum @xmath11 in the @xmath12 direction @xmath13 $ ] , and parity @xmath14 [ either @xmath15 ( written here as @xmath16 ) or @xmath17 ( denoted by @xmath18 ) ] .",
    "we thus may expand the electric and magnetic field operators as @xmath19 where we abbreviated the set of discrete quantum numbers as @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",

    "one reason is that this corresponds to a laser field , another is that the statistics of the incoming light is then poissonian , so that possible non - classical statistics arise from the scattering process , not from the incoming light .",
    "hence , we assume the input fields satisfy @xmath123 , a dimensionless number relating the total amplitude of the free field at the detection point to the contribution of the dipole field , as @xmath124 below we will connect these quantities to the overlaps with dipole and other multipole waves .",

    "we find for the flux @xmath110 @xmath130 compare this with the expression from @xcite , eq .",
    "( 30 ) , @xmath131 with @xmath132 the total incident flux , @xmath133 the spontaneous emission rate into the solid angle subtended by the incident beam and @xmath134 the total spontaneous emission rate ( corresponding to our @xmath69 ) .",
    "extreme focusing corresponds to @xmath135 .",
    "we can then make the identifications @xmath136 this comparison , though , is not perfect . in our case",
    "@xmath137 is complex and can , in principle , take on any value , but @xmath138 ( and with light coming from 1 direction only , one even has @xmath139 ) .",
    "the strongest effects on photon statistics occur in the weak driving limit @xmath140 , in the strong driving limit the atom saturates and the output field will display poissonian statistics and on resonance .",
    "we therefore consider the special case of weak on - resonance excitation , and obtain @xmath141 this result of @xmath107 is plotted in figure  1 .",
    "remarkably , the plot is very similar to that obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite for illumination with gaussian beams and detection in the forward direction ( see fig .  8 there ) . in the latter case ,",
    "the result is plotted as a function of the beam waist .",
    "the remarkable aspect is , though , that the gaussian beams are in fact no longer solutions to the maxwell equations as the focusing conditions are too strong for the paraxial approximation to be valid . here ,",
    "on the other hand , the result is not an approximation , but is plotted as a function of @xmath142 .",
    ", in the weak - driving limit and on resonance , as a function of @xmath142 for various values of the complex phase @xmath143 of @xmath137 : @xmath144 for @xmath145 . ]",
    "for reference we also give the flux of the output dipole field at position @xmath146 in the _ absence _ of the atom : @xmath147 .",
    "this leads us to the following observations in special cases    * if one illuminates the atom with only the dipole field , so that @xmath148 , one has the strongest possible focusing .",
    "all light is coupled to the atom , and we note that the correspondence relation ( [ compare ] ) shows that this case corresponds to @xmath149 in terms of carmichael s parameters , indicating illumination with light that fills the full @xmath150 solid angle . moreover , this case is the only one where @xmath137 and thereby the flux and photon statistics do not depend on the detection point . + for @xmath148 the output flux equals the input flux : @xmath151 , and @xmath152 . one way to understand this is to note that while @xmath153 , we have for the source field @xmath154 .",
    "thus the expectation value of the total field is @xmath155 .",
    "however , this does not mean that a @xmath156 phase change is the only difference .",
    "+ in fact , the statistics of the light has been affected by the presence of the atom .",
    "the output photons are bunched as @xmath157 , even though the input field dispayed poissonian statistics .",
    "the explanation for this effect is similar to that given in @xcite for strong bunching : the atom can not absorb any photons if it is in the excited state , but can if it is in the ground state .",
    "the detection of a photon thus makes it more likely the atom would be found in the excited state , which in turn makes it more likely to detect a second photon , namely one emitted by the atom .",
    "* when the _ free _ fields interfere destructively at the observation point ( so that @xmath158 ) , the field there arises solely from the atom s fluorescence .",
    "that light , as is well - known , is anti - bunched and @xmath159 ( as we are in the weak driving limit ) .",
    "( the reason is simple , the detection operator is @xmath160 and applying this operator twice yields zero . )",
    "the flux @xmath110 is @xmath161 as a result of the source field being twice as strong as the input dipole field , @xmath154 . * when @xmath162 one finds the largest bunching effect , with @xmath163 .",
    "this occurs simply because the total intensity there vanishes , @xmath164 , as the source field ( of amplitude @xmath165 ) destructively interferes with the free field ( with dipole wave and the rest each contributing an amplitude @xmath125 ) . *",
    "when @xmath166 the total detected flux is equal to @xmath161 with now the free fields contributing @xmath167 to the amplitude , the source field subtracting @xmath168 , as before .",
    "interestingly , we again have completely anti - bunched light , @xmath159 ( at least in the low - intensity limit ) . here",
    "is why ( in a quantum - trajectory picture ) the light is anti - bunched in this case : the detection operator is effectively @xmath169 , since the state of the free radiation field ( in the detection point ) is a coherent state with amplitude @xmath167 .",
    "the steady state of the atom in between photodetection events is @xmath170 ( valid to first order order in the small parameter @xmath171 ) .",
    "after the first detection of a photon , we collapse the state onto @xmath172 , which is only of order @xmath173 . in words , the two paths to produce a photon after the first photodetection event ( one from the laser field , the other from the atom ) interfere almost completely destructively .",
    "hence , @xmath174 in the weak driving limit .",
    "+ we note here that this type of anti - bunching is connected to a collapse of the atom to the _ excited _ state after the first photodetection , in contrast to the case of pure fluorescence , where the atom is collapsed into the ground state . *",
    "if the field not coupled to the atom is large , the photon statistics of the total field will be dominated by that field , leading to poissonian light with @xmath175 .",
    "the overlap of the incoming field with the appropriate dipole wave is clearly the most crucial quantity , as only that part interacts with the atom .",
    "for instance , if we denote that overlap by @xmath176 , then it easy to see that the following two relations , involving parameters used before , hold : @xmath177 one question relevant in practice is , what is the largest overlap possible for a given numerical aperture ? in order to answer this question we revert to the debye approximation . in that approximation the field in a focus , resulting from a high numerical aperture , is expanded in plane waves ( hence , the resulting expressions are conveniently given as fourier transforms ) .",
    "the approximation consists in taking into account only the geometric optics rays from the aperture , thus leaving out edge effects . for a recent discussion of high - aperture beams and more background information , see @xcite .",
    "in refs  @xcite this approximation is used to calculate the intensity profile of a particularly strongly focused type of waves that were also generated in an actual experiment .",
    "those waves are _ longitudinally _ polarized in the focal spot .",
    "as before , in reciprocal space the wave function factorize into a delta function @xmath178 and a part depending only on the unit vector @xmath47 .",
    "we only need the latter part , which we denote by @xmath179 . in spherical coordinates",
    "@xmath180 for @xmath47 one gets @xmath181 with @xmath182 a unit vector indicating the direction of the electric field , @xmath183 the previous expressions all follow directly from eq .",

    "the figure also shows that for light coming from one direction the light beams from refs .",
    "@xcite are very close to the optimum ( for fixed polarization ) in the limit of small @xmath210 , but for @xmath211 the distance from the optimum suddenly increases .    in most optical experiments ,",
    "however , light beams in the focus are _ transversely _ polarized",
    ". the overlap of such beams with a transversely polarized dipole wave ( in our notation , such a linearly polarized dipole wave would , of course , be a superposition of @xmath212 and @xmath213 ) , has been studied before in refs .",
    "it turns out ( see fig .  1 in @xcite and fig .  3 below ) that for opening angles @xmath184 less than @xmath214 the overlap with the appropriate dipole waves tends to be larger for transverse than for longitudinal polarizations .",
    "this is a consequence of the latter radiation pattern having larger side lobes .",
    "this observation is true both for a truncated dipole wave and for more realistic light beams . for @xmath206",
    "the dipole content of truncated dipole waves is exactly @xmath215 for both polarizations , and for values of @xmath184 larger than @xmath214 longitudinally polarized waves have larger overlaps .",

    "these curves are all obtained from ref .",
    "@xcite . ]",
    "let us finally compare the numbers for more realistic beams : the transversely polarized wave that results from ( nearly ) uniform illumination of an aplanatic lens ( called `` sine '' wave in @xcite ) has a dipole wave content @xmath217 at @xmath206 , which is in fact slightly smaller than the number quoted above for the beams described by eq .",
    "( [ quab ] ) in the limit @xmath208 .",
    "we have shown how to reformulate the quasi 1-dimensional theory of @xcite to study photon statistics effects in resonant light scattering off an atom in the full 3-dimensional setting , by expanding the fields in multipole waves @xcite .",
    "we applied this formalism to the case of illuminating an atom with strongly focused light , and found that there is a single parameter , @xmath137 , that contains all the important information .",
    "this is true when one assumes one detects a single polarization component .",
    "otherwise , for each polarization component that is detected there is a parameter like @xmath137 .",
    "the overlap of the incoming light beam with an electric dipole wave determines the strength of the atom - light interaction .",
    "one expects that smaller focal spot sizes tend to correspond to larger overlaps , as indeed the dipole wave is the only wave with a nonzero intensity in the origin .",
    "we found a confirmation of this suspicion in figure  2 , where the overlaps of a particular class of focused light beams with very small spot sizes are plotted .",
    "these beams turn out to have almost the maximum possible overlap , given a fixed numerical aperture ( this is true within the debye approximation ) , and given a _ longitudinal _ polarization . with this measure ,",
    "the more standard case of transverse polarization leads in fact to even better focusing for opening angles @xmath184 less than @xmath214 , although the spot sizes is actually larger @xcite . for @xmath211 , on the other hand , longitudinal polarization becomes better than transverse polarization .",
    "finally , we note that focused light contains a great deal more structure than just a small focal spot size .",
    "in particular there are several different types of topological properties that are both robust ( i.e. , they do not disappear when boundary conditions are slightly changed ) and generic ( i.e. , they occur under general , non - special circumstances ) . for a nice discussion see @xcite .",
    "some of those properties , such as phase and polarization singularities , occur on length scales at or even below the wavelength of the light .",
    "similarly , around a zero of the intensity the spectral density of the light can be singular as well @xcite .",
    "an open question is what the quantum signatures are of such topological structures , and whether one can probe those with an atom or a quantum dot ?",
    "an atom is most likely too small to notice changes of polarization or spectrum , even if the change takes place within a wavelength , but a quantum dot may just be sufficiently large . in that case",
    "one may wonder , is there a difference between a quantum dot seeing red - shifted and blue - shifted light everywhere or seeing red - shifted light in one location and blue - shifted light in another ? or similarly , is there a difference between seeing unpolarized light or seeing horizontal polarization in one location and vertical polarization in another ?",

    "kimble for many discussions on the motivation and ideas for this work , then g.  leuchs , s.  quabis , and r.  dorn for suggesting that `` their '' light beams may have a large overlap with dipole waves ( and indeed , they do ) , for other discussions on focused light beams , and for their hospitality in erlangen , and finally c.j.r .",
    "sheppard for useful comments and for pointing out that the strongest focusing possible is achieved by ( truncated ) dipole waves ."
