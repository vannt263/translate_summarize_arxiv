    "despite the pioneering work of @xcite on pulsar magnetospheres created by a rotating aligned dipole and of @xcite on relativistic winds both of which have been further explored in @xcite , there are few exact analytic solutions in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics ( mhd ) .",
    "prendergast s ( 2005 ) solution for a point explosion of force - free magnetic energy was the foundation of our recent work on that theme @xcite but recent advances have been mainly computational .",
    "the early axisymmetric static solution by @xcite has been followed by accurate computations of @xcite and @xcite which give solutions for the steady aligned pulsar while @xcite considered both time - dependent instabilities at the edge of the corotating zone and the non - aligned case .",
    "@xcite studied the time dependent relativistic problem of both the aligned and the oblique rotator ; in the case of the aligned rotator he confirmed the results of @xcite who have studied the time - independent problem , whereas for the oblique rotator he presented the three - dimensional structure of the magnetosphere .",
    "recent evidence that the pulses are generated near the light cylinder reinforce ideas put forward by @xcite who considered the orthogonally aligned cylindrical pulsar .",
    "numerical solutions more relevant to active galactic nuclei have been developed by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "more recently @xcite have studied the problem of a spinning monopole , and they found that the combined effect of rotation and the magnetic field provide sufficient conversion of magnetic energy to kinetic with profound applications to grbs but also to pulsar systems .",
    "force - free fields have been used as an approximation for pulsar magnetospheres . leaving a magnetic field configuration to relax",
    ", we take a final state of a force - free magnetic field .",
    "taking into account that the pulsar magnetosphere is dominated by the electromagnetic fields and considering that the effects of inertia are weaker makes the force - free assumption a valid starting point .",
    "the non - relativistic force - free approximation requires that the electric current flows along the magnetic field lines but neglects any effect of the electric field on the charges . in relativistic mhd",
    "the electric field is no more negligible as the electric field , in non - resistive mhd , is given by the cross product of the magnetic field with the velocity scaled to the speed of light .",
    "thus the relativistic force - free approximation requires that the force of the magnetic field on the currents and that of the induced electric field on the charges add to zero .    here",
    "we explore the simplest exact relativistic force - free fields , those with cylindrical symmetry , and their coupling to rotating magnetospheres which corotate out to the light cylinder .",
    "while these solutions are very limited they allow us to answer questions such as : when one end of a cylinder of force - free field is rotated at relativistic speed , is its flux per unit area greater than or less than the static field that surrounds it in pressure equilibrium , i.e. if we start rotating one end of a tube of flux , does the twist generated in it lead to its expansion or does its cross - section remain the same or even contract ?",
    "what if anything happens as the rotation velocity of the tube approaches the speed of light ? how rapidly does the rotation advance along the tube ?",
    "for non - relativistic mhd this problem was treated in detail in @xcite but inevitably that has little bearing on light cylinders .",
    "we are studying idealized mhd in which the effects of resistivity are absent , therefore field lines that join the source of twist rotate while those that do not are left static .",
    "thus a discontinuity is no surprise . in section 2",
    "we give the basic equations and solve them to find the general steady cylindrical force - free fields .",
    "section 3 explores some simple special cases in greater detail , while section 4 gives the time - dependent exact solution for rotationally generated alfvn waves traveling down a uniform field .",
    "section 5 considers how a rotating star or a pulsar might generate such waves in the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "it also presents the conundrum of how a pulsar s field that extends beyond the light cylinder can connect to an anti - aligned interstellar field and suggests a possible resolution .",
    "we take the magnetic field and the velocity of the fluid to lie on cylinders and in cylindrical polars @xmath0 so @xmath1 and @xmath2\\ , , \\label{magnetic}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath3\\ , .",
    "\\label{velocity}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the fluid is perfectly conducting so @xmath4\\ , , \\label{electric}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] since @xmath5 is independent of @xmath6 and @xmath7 it follows that @xmath8 so @xmath9 is time independent .",
    "the charge density , @xmath10 , is given by @xmath11\\ , .",
    "\\label{charge}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] provided @xmath12 is independent of time the current density , @xmath13 , is given by @xmath14 the force - free condition is @xmath15 using the expressions for @xmath10 and @xmath13 above , this becomes @xmath16^{2}-\\frac{1}{2}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}b_{z}^{2}-\\frac{1}{2r^{2}}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial r}(rb_{\\phi})^{2}=0\\ , .",
    "\\label{force2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we notice that only the component of @xmath12 perpendicular to @xmath9 plays any role in equation ( [ force2 ] ) .",
    "it is then convenient to write @xmath12 in the form @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the unit vector along @xmath9 .",
    "we note that @xmath19 is not the component of @xmath12 along @xmath9 which contains also @xmath20 .",
    "thus any of our velocity fields may be considered as a ( differential ) rotation with flow along @xmath9 superposed .",
    "since the the flow along @xmath9 does not contribute to the @xmath21 term in ( [ force2 ] ) that equation becomes @xmath22 integrating the last term by parts and then dividing by @xmath23 we find @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the area average of @xmath26 up to @xmath27 .",
    "evidently if @xmath28 and @xmath29 are specified such that the right hand side of ( [ bf ] ) is non - negative , then ( [ bf ] ) determines @xmath30 ( up to a sign ) . with @xmath9 and @xmath31",
    "then known , @xmath32 follows from ( [ electric ] ) , @xmath10 from ( [ charge ] ) and @xmath13 from ( [ current ] ) .",
    "thus the whole electromagnetic configuration is determined but to find the flow we must also specify the velocity @xmath33 along @xmath9 .",
    "this is subject to the restriction that @xmath34 which gives @xmath35 that is @xmath36 , which can be satisfied by a real @xmath19 for example @xmath37 provided @xmath38 which is always satisfied since from ( [ bf ] ) the expression on the left is @xmath39 .",
    "notice there is no restriction that @xmath40 because the fluid can move along the lines of the force to counteract such a superluminal rotation leaving its total @xmath41 .",
    "this is true however large @xmath42 becomes !",
    "looking at equation ( [ bf ] ) there are several special cases that are worth noticing because they illustrate situations of particular simplicity .",
    "all the fields so far discussed are helical so it is useful here to define the pitch @xmath43 of a helical field line .",
    "the equation of such a field line is given by @xmath44 with @xmath27 constant .",
    "the pitch is defined as @xmath45 so @xmath46 .",
    "\\(i ) if @xmath47 is independent of @xmath27 then @xmath48 so from ( [ bf ] ) @xmath49 .",
    "when @xmath50 , @xmath51 but as pointed out above there is no restriction that @xmath52 so we can have situations with @xmath53 at large @xmath27 .",
    "there is however a tendency for such solutions to be unstable . in all cases",
    "the lines of force are given by @xmath54const and @xmath55 .",
    "the pitch of the resultant helix is @xmath56 so @xmath57 .",
    "( ii)writing equation ( [ bf ] ) in terms of the pitch @xmath43 we find @xmath58=<b_{z}^{2}>\\ , , \\label{bz}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] a remarkable special case occurs when @xmath59 is independent of @xmath27 .",
    "this occurs when for example both the pitch and the angular velocity are both constant",
    ". then we may multiply equation ( [ bz ] ) by @xmath23 and differentiate the result with respect to @xmath23 ; this gives us @xmath26 on the right which cancels against a term on the left . dividing the resultant equation by @xmath23 yields @xmath60 + 2(\\kappa^{2}-\\omega^{2}/c^{2})b_{z}^{2}=0\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "this integrates to give , on taking the square root @xmath61 notice that the field is uniform if @xmath62 .",
    "if now a rotating tube of force is surrounded by a static uniform field @xmath63 at equilibrium with it at @xmath64 @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the surface charge on the rotating cylinder and @xmath5 is the electric field component inside the boundary @xmath64 . by gauss s theorem @xmath67 and from ( [ electric ] )",
    "hence @xmath69 where @xmath70 .",
    "thus when @xmath71 the rotating uniform field has the same @xmath72 as the non - rotating field outside .",
    "more generally the flux along the cylinder of radius @xmath73 is @xmath74\\ , .",
    "\\end{array}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this function of @xmath75 maximises at @xmath76 when @xmath77 that is when @xmath78 . in all other cases the equilibrium twisted field configuration carries less flux over the circle @xmath79 than the straight bounding field @xmath80 .",
    "thus although some feel that the twisting of the field should cause it to contract under the influence of the hoop stresses so generated , nevertheless this is more than offset by the increase in field strength per unit longitudinal flux which is also caused by the twisting of the field .",
    "notice however we have only proved this when @xmath81 is independent of @xmath27 within the twisted region .",
    "however for @xmath82 between @xmath83 and @xmath84 the flux decrease is less than @xmath85 so there is only a @xmath86 increase in the radius of the twisted rotating cylinder in such circumstances .",
    "an untwisted @xmath9 field spinning about the axis of a cylinder whose top speed is @xmath87 of the velocity of light only increases its radius by about about @xmath88 !",
    "\\(iii ) now suppose that the rotation is uniform out to @xmath89 but thereafter takes the keplerian profile @xmath90 .",
    "we substitute this velocity profile in equation  ( [ bf ] ) @xmath91 now the alfvn waves generated by such a rotation will travel at the speed light in a force - free field ( see section 4 ) so the pitch generated is given by @xmath92 so @xmath93 so the first and last terms of equation ( [ bf2 ] ) cancel so we are left with @xmath48 so the z - component of the field is uniform despite its differential rotation i.e. we are back to ( i ) .",
    "since the solutions that leave the flux through the cylinder unchanged have a uniform @xmath47 we now look for time dependent solutions of the form @xmath94 $ ] so @xmath1 @xmath95+v_{b } \\bm{\\hat{b}}\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then , @xmath96 @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 @xmath100 @xmath101 from the force - free condition ( [ force ] ) we have @xmath102+\\nonumber \\\\",
    "\\big(\\frac{\\dot{\\omega}}{c^{2}}b_{0}r-\\frac{\\partial b_{\\phi}}{\\partial z}\\big)(b_{\\phi}\\bm{\\hat{z}}-b_{0}\\bm{\\hat{\\phi}})=0\\ , . \\label{force3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath103 and @xmath104 components of this equation are satisfied provided @xmath105 but by ( [ curle ] ) @xmath106 hence @xmath107 which wave equation is satisfied by @xmath108 $ ] .",
    "then @xmath109 and putting this back into ( [ force3 ] ) the @xmath110 component is satisfied identically , so we have an exact solution for any wave form @xmath111 .",
    "of course we could superpose any @xmath112 but to solve the problem of a perfectly conducting disc at @xmath113 forced to rotate at a given time dependent rate @xmath114 we need the wave that travels out from the origin .",
    "then the magnetic field at @xmath115 , @xmath79 rotates at @xmath111 and that at @xmath116 , @xmath79 rotates at @xmath112 , see fig .  1 .",
    "thus we have alfvn waves generated by a rotating disc . at @xmath64",
    "there is a surface density of charge @xmath117 ; @xmath118 , which accounts for the electric field outside @xmath64 .",
    "the changing surface density of charge involves a sheet current along the cylinder given by integrating ( [ force3 ] ) across the discontinuity in @xmath30 at @xmath64 thus @xmath119 and @xmath120 as required by charge conservation .",
    "note that the net charge of the rotating cylinder is zero , as the volume charge density given by ( [ charge ] ) and the surface charge density when integrated over the cylindrical volume and the discontinuity surface respectively add up to zero , so the electric field outside the cylinder is zero .",
    "@xcite in the context of blandford - znajek mechanism has investigated similar solutions .",
    "this is also the light cylinder.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "so far our solutions have been exact but abstract .",
    "we now take a step nearer to the real world but the application is somewhat forced and the solution inexact .",
    "consider a star with a dipolar magnetic field with axis along @xmath121 .",
    "let it be embedded in an interstellar magnetic field oriented in the same direction .",
    "then the field is as shown in fig .  2 where the separatrix has been emphasised .",
    "the closed field lines near the star will lie in meridional planes and rotate with the star",
    ". the outermost field lines outside any separatrix will not rotate at all just like the outer field lines in fig .  1 .",
    "the remaining field lines that join the star to the interstellar gas will carry the torque that generates the alfvn wave that propagates along the interstellar field to great distances from the star . in our force - free approximation",
    "these alfvn waves travel at the velocity of light but in reality the fields will probably be too weak well away from the star so there the rotational disturbance will travel at the alfvn speed given by @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the gas density . in fig .  2 we have assumed that the light cylinder lies beyond the asymptotic radius of the separatrix . for a strong stellar dipole or a weaker interstellar field",
    "this will not be true .",
    "we shall consider that situation afterwards .",
    "we write the field in the form @xmath124 then for a dipole @xmath125 in a straight external field we find @xmath126 the separatrix @xmath127 which for large @xmath7 gives @xmath128 . thus all the flux with @xmath129 links the star to the interstellar magnetic field . at large @xmath7",
    "we have from section 3 ( i ) and under equation  ( 27 ) @xmath130 , so since near the star we need @xmath131 to carry the torque away from the star we set @xmath132 for @xmath133 , @xmath134 and @xmath135 for @xmath7 large since that gives the field found in section 4 .",
    "we therefore choose as our approximation @xmath136 whenever @xmath115 and @xmath134 . for @xmath137 , @xmath138 , see fig  3 .",
    "since we have used the @xmath139 of the non - rotating configuration which will in practice be modified by the rotating charges this is only approximate ; however we note that in our rotating cylinder the @xmath47 remained at @xmath63 even in the presence of the rotation so at large @xmath7 the proposed solution is exact .",
    "now we consider the case in which the light cylinder is of smaller radius than the asymptotic radius , @xmath73 , of the separatrix of the static field .",
    "close to the light cylinder the interstellar magnetic field is far too weak to have any effect so for the aligned pulsar , the work of @xcite as modified by @xcite and most recently treated @xcite is appropriate . however in those treatments the far field has a weak poloidal component and spirals off to infinity with that component not far from radial .",
    "there the field will be radically modified if the pulsar resides in an asymptotic field from the interstellar medium because asymptotically the field from the pulsar must align along the cylinders and produce alfvn waves propagating along them .",
    "@xmath140 will be much greater than @xmath141 .",
    "4 illustrates the type of the field configuration that we envisage .",
    "all the pulsar field lines that do not close within the light cylinder end up winding around the interstellar field and their @xmath142 is still that of the pulsar !                    the flux function for the pure dipolar field is @xmath143 so the flux that fails to reach the equator within the light cylinder in such a field would be @xmath144 . in reality",
    "the field is distorted by the rotation to be more like @xmath145 for @xmath146 which gives @xmath147 . a very rough model that gets the fluxes right ( but is not force - free ) is given by the @xmath139 above for @xmath148 , @xmath149 , for @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 for @xmath153 . as before the toroidal field",
    "is given as in equation  ( 28 ) with @xmath154 for @xmath155 and zero elsewhere .",
    "to see the orders of magnitude consider a pulsar whose polar field is @xmath156 and suppose the radius of the polar cap whose field does not close within the light cylinder is @xmath157 and the inter - stellar field is @xmath63 .",
    "then the asymptotic radius of the field attached to the pulsar will be @xmath158 suitable values might be @xmath159 , @xmath160 and @xmath161 giving @xmath162 .",
    "the value of @xmath157 is linked to the pulsars rotation rate @xmath142 and radius @xmath163 by @xmath164 which gives @xmath161 for @xmath165 for a pulsar with a period of @xmath166 .",
    "more generally @xmath167 where @xmath168 is the pulsar period . for the numbers above but general @xmath168 , we find @xmath169 which is many times the speed of light .",
    "if the alfvn wave advances at c then in the interstellar gas @xmath170 in the idealised model and this is increased by the factor @xmath171 if the alfvn speed is @xmath172 .",
    "however such highly wound magnetic fields are likely to be highly unstable . in the ideal case",
    "the plasma has to move along the field so that @xmath173 .",
    "the field winds through the plasma like an archimidean screw winds up the water .",
    "while these estimates will be complicated by instabilities they do indicate that pulsars generate much enhanced fields in the interstellar medium albeit over tubes of force with diameters similar to that of the solar system .",
    "a different but interesting situation occurs when the interstellar field is aligned oppositely to magnetic moment of the pulsar .",
    "the total flux of the pulsar outside its light cylinder , @xmath174 , will be unable to counteract the flux of the interstellar field equatorially all the way to infinity since the latter grows like @xmath23 .",
    "furthermore the pulsar s flux can not cross its equatorial plane outside the light cylinder as by symmetry it would have to cross perpendicularly and the plasma attached would then move faster than light!however the flux from the pulsar has to reach infinity since it carries the flow of plasma pushed by the archimedian screw of the whirling field .",
    "the only place where the flux from the pulsar can deform the field over large distances is close to the axis , indeed in the non - rotating case there would be a neutral point on axis @xcite , see fig .",
    "5 . as the pulsar rotates the equatorial diameter of the field structure around it grows and this neutral point",
    "is sent to infinity along the axis .",
    "an oppositely directed poloidal field is generated near the axis and is accompanied by the @xmath30 and the plasma flow due to the pulsar s rotation .",
    "we illustrate both the weak spin case when all the star s field lies within the light cylinder and rotates with the star fig .  5 and the pulsar case just described in fig .",
    "corresponding to any solution such as that shown in fig .",
    "there is an other solution with the field reversed outside the separatrix . if the longitudinal field inside the separatrix is small compared to the toroidal field there , the field pressures and tension still balance along the separatrix .",
    "the argument given above leads us to believe that this is the field configuration of the steady anti - aligned pulsar .",
    "in this paper we have studied analytical solutions of rotating magnetic fields emerging from dipoles or discs embedded in uniform magnetic fields .",
    "this study is based on the assumption that the dipole field is either aligned or counter - aligned to the external field .",
    "fields at an angle @xmath175 to the dipole may be considered by taking the solutions above with @xmath80 replaced by @xmath176 and superposing a lateral field parallel to the plane of the disk of magnitude @xmath177 , but this gives gives only orders of magnitude and is no substitute for a full non - axially symmetric treatment .",
    "we find that the spinning field will form alfvn waves in the interstellar gas .",
    "there is no need to confine these alfvn waves inside the light cylinder , as the plasma can have a velocity component parallel to the magnetic field and not exceed the speed of light and we find that for typical pulsar values they will occupy cylinders whose cross sectional areas are of the size of the solar system .",
    "these field configurations with tightly wound fields outside the light cylinder are probably very unstable , in particular the pressure of the whole tube along the axis is very large so any departure from axial symmetry will be enhanced by an instability analogous to the fire - hose instability .",
    "however there remains the interesting possibility that the magnetic fields generated over small regions by the thrashing field lines might be surprisingly large although smaller than the maxima estimated via these axially symmetric models ."
