    "current cosmological models show that baryonic matter comprises 4.6% of the total mass distribution of the universe and that dark matter comprises 23% @xcite , thus the dark matter component is approximately five times more abundant than baryonic matter .",
    "baryonic matter follows the distribution of dark matter in the universe and in order to test its existence the baryonic matter must be separated from the dark matter component , but this is problematic because so far it has only been detected during the merging process of galaxy clusters .",
    "galaxy clusters are permeated by x - ray gas , which makes up approximately 90% of the baryonic matter in the cluster ( e.g. @xcite ) . as merging clusters interact , the x - ray gas clouds are slowed through ram pressure while the galaxies and the collisionless dark matter continue nearly uninterrupted @xcite .",
    "thus , merging clusters can provide a unique view where , given the proper configuration , the dark matter component is separated from the x - ray gas .",
    "the presence of dark matter can be inferred by showing an offset of the cluster s overall gravitational potential from its massive x - ray plasma via gravitational lensing analysis .",
    "gravitational lensing , which is the bending of light of background galaxies as it passes near a massive structure , is independent of the type of matter present and thus indicates the overall gravitational potential of the cluster ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "an offset between the x - ray gas distribution and the mass inferred from gravitational lensing has been detected in the bullet cluster @xcite and macs j0025.4 - 1222 @xcite .",
    "alternate gravity models , which replace the need for dark matter with gravity being stronger than newtonian on mpc scales ( e.g. @xcite ) , do not completely model the mass of the merging clusters with the optical and x - ray components alone . instead , alternate gravity models need some smaller amount of dark matter compared to cold dark matter models , but still require at least twice the amount of matter in some dark form as is present in the baryonic component @xcite .",
    "alternate gravity models that recover the mass distribution of the bullet cluster can likely model macs j0025.4 - 1222 because of their similar geometries ( the x - ray peaks are between the lensing peaks ) .",
    "however , given a system with the same mass and different geometry , alternate gravity plus dark matter models get a different answer than general relativity @xcite .",
    "results are needed from additional merging clusters with different geometries in order to determine which model is correct .",
    "additionally , merging clusters are one of the few ways to measure the self - interaction cross section of dark matter .",
    "a1758 , which is composed of four clusters , is undergoing two separate mergers .",
    "evidence that the two clusters in a1758n ( both are 7 kev clusters ) are merging includes a projected separation of 800 kpc between its two clusters , a disturbed x - ray gas distribution , and a separation of the x - ray gas from one of the clusters .",
    "evidence that the less massive clusters in a1758s ( both 5 kev clusters ) are undergoing a merger is that there is very little projected separation between the clusters and it has a disturbed x - ray morphology @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence of a merger between a1758n and a1758s in the x - ray signature and they have a projected separation of 2.0 mpc @xcite .",
    "a1758n introduces a new geometry that is different from previously published mergers .",
    "one weak lensing peak overlaps an x - ray peak while the other weak lensing peak is clearly separated from the x - ray component @xcite .",
    "the dynamical state of a1758n given in @xcite is that the southeast cluster is moving to the southeast and the northwest cluster is moving to the north .",
    "@xcite conclude that the clusters in a1758s appear to be at the point of closest approach , but could be a projection effect .",
    "however , @xcite argue against a1758s being at closest approach based on its lower brightness in the core .",
    "there is very little redshift information for a1758 ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "@xcite show that a1758n and a1758s have a velocity difference of less than 2100 km s@xmath4 , which is consistent with infall velocity at the redshifts they fit from spectral analysis of the x - ray gas .",
    "the previous lensing analysis by @xcite was done with two band filters .",
    "this analysis improves upon their work by using deeper images to get better shape information of background galaxies and uses a third filter , which allows for better separation of cluster galaxies from the background . as a result",
    ", this work has a more detailed weak lensing shear signal and mass reconstruction of a1758 .    throughout this paper , we use the cosmological parameters @xmath5 km sec@xmath4 mpc@xmath4 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "for our analysis , we used observations of a1758 taken with two observatories , with the goal of obtaining a broad ground - based field of view ( subaru ) for a weak lensing analysis of the cluster with improved spaced - based imaging ( hubble ) of the cluster cores . here",
    "we describe the images we acquired and the reduction process used to prepare just the ground - based images for the weak lensing measurements . in the end , the hubble images were not adequate for getting shape measurements , but were used to identify strong lensing candidates .",
    "the weak lensing analysis is described in section [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "observations of a1758 were carried out on the subaru telescope s suprime cam @xcite , which is a wide - field camera whose field of view is @xmath8 .",
    "images in @xmath9 and @xmath10 passbands were taken on april 7 , 2008 using time acquired from the gemini time - share program .",
    "the weather for the night was photometric .",
    "each of our images were 300-sec exposures , which we chose in order to minimize the number of saturated stars while keeping ccd readout overhead to an acceptable level . in total we took 6 images in @xmath9 and 16 images in @xmath10 , giving 30 and 80 minutes total integration time respectively .",
    "the telescope was dithered by 20@xmath11 after each image was taken to fill in chip gaps and allow for night sky flats to be created .",
    "the @xmath9 images had a range of @xmath12 seeing and a typical value ( of the combined images ) of @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath10 images ranged from @xmath14 and had a typical value of @xmath15 .    to get a third passband , we used archived subaru suprime cam @xmath16 images , downloaded from smoka @xcite which were taken on july 17 , 2007 .",
    "we used 6 images , each with a 500-sec exposure time , giving a total exposure time of 50 minutes .",
    "the images in @xmath16 were taken with a different rotation angle , therefore the field of view of the @xmath16 band did not completely overlap that of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 images , but did cover both the a1758n and a1758s regions . the seeing in the @xmath16 images ranged from @xmath17 and had a typical value of @xmath18 . after rotating the @xmath16 image into the orientation of the @xmath9 and",
    "@xmath10 images the typical seeing increased to @xmath19 .",
    "image processing was as follows .",
    "a master bias file was created for each of the ten chips by averaging pixel values within @xmath20 of the initial mean .",
    "these master bias files were subtracted from the science frames and then a linear fit was made of the overscan strip to subtract any residual bias changes .",
    "a master flat was first created for each chip from the bias subtracted dome flat images and each chip was smoothed and visually analyzed for steep gradients and dust or other undesirable chip features .",
    "typical pixel values were kept in these normalized flats in the range of @xmath21 and the remaining pixels were marked bad .",
    "the four corner chips , however , had a steep gradient in the far corners of the ccd array and pixel values were kept in the range of @xmath22 to reject the worst parts of the flats while keeping as much of each corner chip as possible .",
    "the science frames were divided by the master flat of the corresponding chip .",
    "another set of flats was created from the flattened science frames and having multiple pointings allowed for excluding individual chips with saturated stars .",
    "the science frames were then divided by these new flats according to chip .",
    "the sky background was subtracted from each file by making a smoothed image of all local minima within @xmath23 of the mode of pixel values in order to avoid minima in saturated stars .",
    "the chip images were scaled so that they had equal gain and the same sky levels .    the brightest stars and galaxies in a1758 were then aligned with 633 matching objects in the usno catalog by fitting a @xmath24 order polynomial ( 3 free parameters per chip : @xmath25 , @xmath26 , and rotation ) to get the ten chip planes into the detector plane .",
    "we kept one chip fixed and found a solution to the other nine chips in relation to it ( 27 free parameters , which we kept constant for all images ) .",
    "we simultaneously created a @xmath27 order 2d polynomial solution for each image from the detector plane to the sky ( 36 free parameters per image ) with 43,119 total stars ( stars per image ranged from @xmath28 ) from 75 images taken on april 7 , 2008 , which is much larger than the @xmath29 free parameters needed for the solution .",
    "we created a separate @xmath27 order solution for the @xmath16 images taken on july 17 , 2007 with an average of 695 stars per image .",
    "our mapping to the usno catalogs was accurate to @xmath30 ( median ) , consistent with the accuracy of the catalog itself .",
    "the consistency of the stars between images in this mapping process was accurate to within @xmath31 ( median ) and there were no large scale gradients in the residual offsets in these measurements .",
    "standard stars taken on april 7 , 2008 include the fields sa98 , sa104 , and two pointings of sa110 ( the fields taken on july 17 , 2007 include sa104 and sa107 ) and were reduced in the same manner as above .",
    "standards that lay on bad pixels were discarded if the pixels lay within several half - light radii of the centroid .",
    "the zeropoint magnitudes were calculated as a function of color and airmass with rms variance in @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath32 of 0.031 , 0.014 and 0.019 , respectively , and is the primary error of our photometry . there were no large scale gradients in the zeropoint levels or errors by position .",
    "we obtained observations of the a1758n substructure field using a 28 pointing mosaic with the wide field planetary camera 2 ( wfpc2 ) in the f606w filter in cycle 16 , converting the original 3 passband , 4 pointing acs proposal to a single passband wfpc2 mosaic after the acs shutdown the night after the cycle 16 proposals were due .",
    "the observations were taken between october 23rd and 28th , 2007 .",
    "the mosaic was arranged in two layers , a 16 pointing first layer and a 12 pointing second layer .",
    "the pointings were taken with the same approximate roll angle , with the second layer pointings offset by roughly half a wfpc2 chip in size ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the offset was done in order to attempt to identify the charge transfer inefficiency ( cti ) pattern in the ccds and correct it as part of image reduction in a similar manner to how the cti in the advanced camera for surveys has been corrected @xcite .",
    "the wfpc2 cti was so bad , however , that we were unable to create a suitable correction scheme that would remove the cti from being the dominant systematic error in galaxy shape measurements .",
    "to process the images we used the standard calibration data and a modified version of custom software from the haggles project ( marshall et al .",
    "2011 , in preparation ) , which is based upon ` multidrizzle `  @xcite . specifically , we adapted the code to be compatible with wfpc2 data and disabled iterative astrometric matching due to the limited wfpc2 field - of - view .",
    "the results are the same as using ` multidrizzle ` . to create a final mosaic we utilized the _ scamp _ v1.4.6 and _ swarp _",
    "v2.17.1 packages @xcite .",
    "the final mosaic has a mean internal astrometric uncertainty of @xmath34 . due to the lack of a cti correction",
    ", we found that we could not trust the weak lensing measurements enough to believe any substructures in the hst data , and so have used only the subaru images for the weak lensing analysis below .",
    "we use the hst images in the strong lens identification section ( section [ sec : stronglens ] ) .",
    "after we processed the subaru images and combined them by filter , we used sextractor @xcite on the final images to create a catalog of objects and measure their brightness .",
    "then we used a modified version of the imcat softwarekaiser / imcat/ ] to measure size , shape , and significance of the objects in the catalog .",
    "the resultant catalogs were purged of objects with less than @xmath35 ( to not dilute the shear signal ) , with an extremely high ellipticity ( 0.6 , to reject cosmic rays that are nearly parallel to the detector ) , or that had any bad pixels ( which would bias the centroid , flux and shape measurements ) .",
    "we determined the psf by plotting all objects in radius vs.  magnitude space and selecting those objects with constant radius ( @xmath36 pixels ) and @xmath10 as faint as @xmath37 mag .",
    "these objects are mainly stars , but may include some small , faint galaxies .",
    "these point - like ( or very small ) objects have shapes that are entirely ( or heavily ) influenced by the psf and provide us a way to model it in each image .",
    "we want isolated objects so that close neighbors do not negatively influence our psf model . after removing objects that had neighbors within 30 pixels ( @xmath38 half - light radii )",
    ", the remaining objects were modeled using a @xmath39 order 2d polynomial to iteratively fit the objects and reject anomalies .",
    "the remaining stars were then used to calculate the psf .    in order to isolate the background galaxies in the full catalog , we removed all objects from the catalog that had a smaller half - light radius than the largest stars used to create the psf model ( @xmath40 2.2 pixels )",
    ". objects were also removed if they had an unusually large maximum pixel value compared to their overall brightness , which indicates something out of the ordinary like a cosmic ray or a faulty pixel .",
    "the objects that remain in the catalog are predominantly the cluster , foreground , and background galaxies .    in order to determine the cluster and foreground galaxies , we plotted simulated galaxies from a catalog provided by r. pell ( priv .",
    "comm . ) , which is based on spectral energy distribution templates of the hyperz photometric redshift code @xcite .",
    "we plotted galaxies with @xmath41 in @xmath42 vs.  @xmath43 and compared them to the galaxies within @xmath44 of the two bcgs in a1758n .",
    "we then applied a box cut around the knot of red sequence galaxies and the trail of bluer ( spiral ) galaxies .",
    "this box cut was applied to our catalog to remove the cluster and foreground galaxies , leaving just the background galaxies .",
    "next , we discarded any background objects if the sky gradient around them was too steep , meaning they were too close to a bright star or large galaxy and their shapes could be biased .",
    "finally , we discarded galaxies dimmer than @xmath45 and @xmath46 , because they are heavily influenced by the psf and their true shapes are not well measured .",
    "we measured the shear of the resultant catalog of background galaxies by calculating the second moment of their surface brightness and removed the modeled psf using the ksb method @xcite , which removes the ellipticity of the psf from the shear of each object .",
    "our weak lensing analysis of a1758 was applied to the step2 data set @xcite in order to determine the amount of shear recovered in this analysis .",
    "the data sets psfa and psfc are most like the psf conditions of the subaru telescope where the seeing is in the range of @xmath47 .",
    "the @xcite method has a well known bias that under measures the shear and , based on our analysis of the step2 data , we determined that we recovered 0.893 and 0.875 of the shear in the @xmath10 and @xmath16 images .",
    "we divided the shear of each object by the respective value in order to correct for this bias .    to justify our comparison to step2",
    ", we note that the similarities between our images and those simulations include pixelation , correlated noise , realistic galaxy shapes and a realistic psf .",
    "the only significant differences are the potential changes caused by cosmic ray clipping routines , the exact form of the correlated noise and psf shapes , and that the psf was constant in step2 . in our analysis and in step2 results , correlated noise does not appear to significantly affect shape measurements performed using ksb - type psf correction , and any potential effect would be significantly smaller than the level of random noise in individual cluster mass reconstructions .",
    "our co - adding routines were designed to err on the side of leaving cosmic rays in the center of bright objects to avoid pixel clipping that can alter object shapes , particularly those of stars , and have been tested on simulations .",
    "all of these potential effects have been shown to change the shears in both step2 and similar simulations at the few percent level , which is small compared to the random errors in the measurements presented in this paper .",
    "we then placed galaxies into bin regions based on size and significance and weighted each object according to @xmath48 of the shear of the bin .",
    "the shear of objects with the lowest sn are thus given the least weight , @xmath49 .",
    "we reconstructed the mass of a1758 by applying a fourier transform to the shear from the @xmath10 and @xmath16 catalogs separately and found that the two maps were in good agreement with each other and with the bcgs .",
    "we created our final convergence map by using background galaxies that appeared in both the @xmath10 and @xmath16 catalogs , calculated the final reduced shear of each galaxy as @xmath50 and the final weights were added in quadrature ; see the convergence map in figure [ fig : a1758 ] .",
    "we computed @xmath51 @xmath52kpc@xmath53 by taking the cosmos photo - z catalog of @xcite , applying the same color and magnitude cuts as we used on our background galaxy catalog and taking the harmonic mean , which was @xmath54 .",
    "we have created an approximate projected gas mass map using the chandra x - ray image in the 0.83.5 kev energy band extracted from the 41 ks observation ( obsid 2213 ) analyzed in @xcite . for a hot cluster such as a1758 ( @xmath55 kev ,",
    "david & kempner ) , the x - ray emissivity at photon energies @xmath56 depends very weakly on gas temperature ( and its likely variations across the cluster ) .",
    "chandra has a peak of sensitivity at @xmath57 kev , which makes the x - ray surface brightness in our energy band a good representation of the projected x - ray emission measure , @xmath58 .    to convert the projected emission measure to the gas mass requires knowledge of the three - dimensional cluster geometry . unlike the bullet cluster @xcite , which appears to have a simple geometry , the geometry of a1758 is more complicated . in the absence of any information or plausible assumptions on gas distribution along the line of sight ,",
    "an approach frequently used to get a first - order approximation of a gas mass map is simply to take a square root of the x - ray brightness .",
    "since on large scales , clusters have spherical , centrally concentrated density distributions , here we use a slightly more accurate approximation .",
    "we first fitted a spherically - symmetric @xmath59-model to the x - ray radial brightness profile and created a projected gas mass map that corresponds to that model .",
    "this mass map was then multiplied by a correction factor @xmath60 , where @xmath61 is the real x - ray image and @xmath62 is the @xmath59-model image . to normalize the gas mass",
    ", we used an @xmath63 relation from vikhlinin et al .",

    ", the relation gives @xmath68 in a sphere of radius @xmath69 mpc .",
    "we normalized the resulting gas mass map to have the projected mass in an aperture of the radius @xmath70 ( which corresponds to the chandra field of view ) equal to that of the best - fit @xmath59-model with the above mass within the @xmath71 sphere .",

    "other errors in our analysis should be smaller and we have assigned a conservative 25% error ( 68% confidence ) to the gas masses .",
    "our wl mass reconstruction of a1758n was created by using 20,919 background galaxies that appear in both the @xmath10 and @xmath16 images .",
    "the overlapping area between the @xmath10 image and the rotated @xmath16 image is @xmath74 arcmin@xmath75 and results in a density of 24.0 galaxies / arcmin@xmath75 that is used for shear measurements .",

    "the resampled convergence maps always showed a significant amount of mass at both locations , but in these cases the mass signal steadily increased from one peak , across the intermediate region , and continued increasing toward the other peak . finding the centroid away from the expected location",
    "was due to the linear peak finder and _ not _ due to a lack of mass in the weak lensing signal at the location of the peak in question .",
    "the noise in these resamplings occurred in such a way as to create a smooth mass increase away from the peak being calculated .    to quantify the amount of mass in these regions we averaged the reconstructed mass map pixel values ( in units of @xmath81 ) in identical , non - overlapping circular apertures with as large of a radius as possible .",
    "the radius used for the apertures was @xmath82 , or 169.7 kpc at the redshift of a1758 .",
    "the mean @xmath81 within each cutout was converted to mass by multiplying by @xmath83 and the area of the aperture .    when peaks 1 and 2 were found on the opposite side of the midpoint , the average mass of these bootstrap resamplings were low by @xmath84 . at the same time , the midpoint was @xmath85 higher than its average ; in this way the peak finder wandered up the mass structure away from the original region .",

    "fitting nfw profiles to these clusters depends on the input parameters for the inner and outer radii of the fit .",
    "because the weak lensing approximation breaks down in the strong lensing region , the inner radius should be larger than the strong lensing radius .",
    "no strong lensing has yet been confirmed in this system so we used a value of 100 kpc for the inner radius . the outer radius that we used was 3350 kpc , which is the distance from the clusters in a1758n to the nearest edge of our image .",
    "this outer radius is much larger than @xmath101 of both clusters ( shown below ) .",
    "we also allowed our color - color selections to vary ( see section [ sec : analysis ] ) because the subaru filters differ slightly from those in the r. pell catalog and because there may be systematic errors in our zeropoints .",
    "we maximized the significance of our cluster fitting by allowing the redder side of our box cut to increase redwards by 0.5 mag ; other shifts in the box edges did not improve the significance of the clusters .",
    "we attempt to simultaneously fit the individual clusters to obtain their masses , but find that with the current data we can not robustly extract mass measurements .",
    "initially , we fit all four clusters simultaneously ( two in a1758n and two in a1758s ) with nfw profiles .",
    "however , the best fit to one of the weak lensing peaks in a1758s was not a well - behaved cluster , but had a very large ( @xmath102 mpc ) @xmath101 with extremely low ( @xmath103 ) concentration .",
    "we also tried to fit each cluster in a1758s separately ( with and without the clusters in a1758n ) , but the fitting behavior in a1758s persisted in these extreme values for radius and concentration .",
    "in order to determine the mass in the cluster members of a1758n from nfw profiles , we need to decide what to do with the members in a1758s . the effect of including both southern members is to remove mass from the northern members and place it in an extended ( and unphysical , @xmath104 ) cluster . excluding both southern members",
    "greatly increases the radius and mass of the clusters in a1758n .",
    "the results of fitting just the northern clusters simultaneously produces different mass results than when we fit them one at a time .",
    "when fit together , one northern member is five times larger than the other .",
    "when fit separately , the northern clusters are approximately the same size . whether we fit them together or separately , the nfw profiles of both of these methods have approximately the same significance .",
    "our conclusion is that the northern peaks are poorly fit by the classic nfw profile and we do not trust this method of measuring the cluster component masses . for comparison",
    ", however , fitting two clusters in a1758n ( with a single cluster in a1758s ) result in @xmath101 values ( and concentration parameter @xmath105 ) of @xmath106 kpc ( @xmath107 ) and @xmath108 kpc ( @xmath109 ) with confidence @xmath110 and @xmath111 , respectively .    given the problems with fitting the cores of the clusters to measure their mass , we also performed aperture mass densitometry @xcite .",
    "this routine works from the outer radii inward and gives a measurement of how much total mass there is along the line of sight out to any given radius : @xmath112 where @xmath113 is the average @xmath81 within a region and @xmath114 is the azimuthally averaged tangential shear .",
    "this method assumes we are measuring the shear @xmath115 and not the reduced shear @xmath116 , but since we are only measuring this at large radius , the error from this approximation will be minimal .",
    "this method , however , gives no indication of the virial mass of the cluster , so to determine the virial mass we used results by @xcite from 30 x - ray luminous clusters from @xmath117 that gives @xmath118 based on the mass ratio @xmath119 of @xmath120 ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "this ratio is due to the additional mass along the line of sight and because the cluster mass enclosed within a cylindrical volume is larger than the 3d nfw mass within the same radius .",
    "figure [ fig : ratio2d3d ] shows where this mass ratio equals 1.32 @xmath121 , where @xmath122 is our aperture densitometry measurement at radius @xmath123 multiplied by @xmath83 and @xmath124 is the virial mass of an nfw profile with @xmath125 .",
    "the radii that fall within this range are @xmath126 kpc .",
    "the ratio @xmath127 occurs at a radius of 2300 kpc and using this radius as an estimate of @xmath101 we obtain a 3d mass of @xmath128 for a1758n .",
    "this is higher than the mass estimate of @xmath129 for a1758n given by @xcite ( based on x - ray temperature ) for the northern clusters , but our measurements using this technique also includes a portion the mass of a1758s ( 2.0 mpc away ) within 2300 kpc .",
    "the mass estimate of @xcite is @xmath130 for the southern cluster . at this distance ,",
    "the amount of a1758s within 2300 kpc of the northern cluster is roughly 50% ( @xmath131 depending on concentration and morphology ) .",
    "this reduces our 3d mass estimate of a1758n to @xmath132 , which is still higher than , but in agreement at slightly higher than the @xmath133 level with , the mass estimate from @xcite .",
    "the @xmath134 ratio in the region of the midpoint in a1758 is over 300 ( see table [ table : mass ] ) , which is high compared to the values of our peaks @xmath135 .",
    "excess mass in this region could be caused by a self - interaction cross section for dark matter @xcite , some form of non - newtonian gravity @xcite , or a higher concentration of galaxies compared to dark matter . to test if the high @xmath134 ratio in the area between the clusters is significant , we simulated weak lensing observations for two nfw clusters the same size as the members of a1758 and performed the above analysis .",
    "we found that the smoothing did not preferentially increase the mass in the region of the midpoint more than it did in any other direction .",
    "we also tested the catalog for the possibility of core galaxies being wrongly included with the background sample and decrease the reduced shear , and thus the mass , in that region .",
    "we reduced the number of background galaxies in the cores by 10 - 30% and the overall mass was reduced in the cores , but there was no change in the ratio of the @xmath134 ratios of the apertures .",
    "we then compared the @xmath134 ratios of two other regions outside the merger that lie along the line of peaks 1 and 2 and are the same distance away as is the midpoint , but in opposite directions ( see table [ table : mass ] , `` left '' and `` right '' ) .",
    "these two regions were also found to have approximately the same @xmath134 ratio as the midpoint , which may indicate that either there is more dark matter or less red cluster light at this distance .",
    "we measured the mass of a1758s from the bootstrap resampling using aperture cutouts ( see section [ subsec : mass ] and table [ table : mass ] ) .",
    "the masses measured in the two southern clusters ( peaks 3 and 4 , in units of @xmath136 ) are @xmath137 , and @xmath138 , or 5.2@xmath139 and 5.0@xmath139 .",
    "peaks 3 and 4 were included in the bootstrap resampling to determine the errors on the centroid . of the @xmath140 resamplings , peaks 3 and 4 were found in the region of a1758s approximately 62% of the time .",
    "more specifically , peak 3 was found in its own region 18% of the time , but 45% of the time it was found in the region of peak 4 .",
    "the location of the centroid of peak 4 was found in its own region 45% of the time and it was located 16% of the time in the region of peak 3 .",
    "this is a measure of how little mass there is in a1758s and how difficult it was to distinguish between the two cluster members .",
    "@xcite find that the southern clusters are at their closest approach , but is disputed by @xcite who argue that a lack of star formation in the core galaxies of a1758s could be due to them being poorer clusters than a1758n .",
    "we find that the @xmath134 ratio in the southern clusters ( see table [ table : mass ] , peaks 3 and 4 ) match those of the northern clusters , which does not agree with the description of @xcite .",
    "the mass estimate of @xcite for a1758s , based on x - ray gas mass , is @xmath141 . compared to their estimate of a1758n ( @xmath142 )",
    ", this gives a north / south mass ratio of 1.6 .",

    "our image taken by the @xmath144 @xmath145 @xmath146 ( @xmath147 ) wide field planetary camera 2 ( see figure [ fig : strong ] ) shows possible strong lensing candidates in the core region of a1758n .",

    "the two peaks were separated at the @xmath0 level compared to there being only one large mass with two noise bumps . however , the reason that this procedure did not result in a more significant result is due to the noise in the mass map reconstructions rather than a lack of mass in either peak .",
    "we found that 1 - 2% of the time the centroid of one peak wandered across the midpoint ( or to the location of the other peak ) when its mass was low by @xmath167 and the mass around the midpoint was higher than it s average by @xmath85 , creating a ramp for the peak finder to walk away from the original peak .",
