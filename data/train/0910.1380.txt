    "the transform of the title  @xmath0 averages functions in the euclidean upper half - space @xmath5 @xmath6 over the half - spheres centered on the topological boundary  @xmath7 .",
    "courant and hilbert s well known result in  @xcite implies that  @xmath0 is injective on the space of continuous functions . if one further restricts the domain of  @xmath0 to rapidly decreasing functions , as done in  @xcite , then  @xmath0 can be shown to have a continuous inverse  @xmath8 .",
    "the main purpose of this article is to present a novel formula for that inverse which compliments the ones in  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and  @xcite in several important ways :    1 .",
    "our inversion of spherical means holds in all dimensions , has explicit form involving the adjoint operator  @xmath9 , and applies without restrictions to all rapidly decreasing functions in the schwartz space  @xmath10 .",
    "2 .   the validity of our inversion formula follows directly from the classical radon inversion .",
    "we thus establish a new relation between the spherical mean transform  @xmath0 and the classical radon transform  @xmath11 which , together with  @xcite and  @xcite , brings the count for such relations to three .",
    "our formula for  @xmath8 may be expressed as a composition of a certain convolution operator  @xmath12 with a pair of simple one - dimensional mappings . that compositional structure lends itself to a robust fourier - based algorithm suitable for tomographic reconstructions .",
    "although our interest in spherical means is purely mathematical , we would like to mention a few practical applications before delving into the theory .",
    "the following example , taken from  @xcite , explains why  @xmath0 continues to draw attention almost fifty years after having been first considered by courant and hilbert ; it also explains why we refer to the centers of the half - spheres as _",
    "sources_.    consider the following nonhomogeneous hyperbolic equation with a delta - source at @xmath13 and zero initial conditions : @xmath14 think of  @xmath15 as a variable point in the @xmath16-plane and denote by  @xmath17 the solution of problem   evaluated at the location of the source : @xmath18 the _ inverse scattering problem _ associated with equation   is to determine the coefficient  @xmath19 from  @xmath17 .",
    "this problem and its close variants arise in sonar and radar imaging ( see  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively ) , ultrasound diagnostics  @xcite , and seismic tomography  @xcite .",
    "as explained in  @xcite , by making the born approximation one can interpret the data  @xmath17 as the average of  @xmath19 over the sphere of radius  @xmath20 centered at  @xmath15 .",
    "if @xmath21 is compactly supported in the upper ( or lower ) half - space , which is frequently the case , could describe the acoustic reflectivity of underwater or underground environment both of which can be thought of as being semi - infinite in extent . ]",
    "the averages over spheres become averages over half - spheres . in that case",
    "the solution of the linearized inverse scattering problem for equation   is equivalent to the inversion of the spherical mean transform  @xmath0 .",
    "the inspiration for our results comes from norton s work in  @xcite on inversion of  @xmath0 in  @xmath22 . in section  [ s : preliminaries ]",
    "we will show how norton s approach can be generalized to an arbitrary number of dimensions .",
    "specifically , we will define a pair of mappings which intertwine  @xmath0 with an operator  @xmath3 acting on functions in the full euclidean space .",
    "the latter operator is of convolution type : it integrates functions in  @xmath23 over the translates of a paraboloid .",
    "we will exploit the convolutional nature of  @xmath3 in section  [ s : fourier ] where we find  @xmath12 using distribution theory .",
    "our main result , the formula for  @xmath8 , follows from the formula for  @xmath12 and has the general form @xmath24 where  @xmath25 is a one - dimensional operator defined in section  [ s : results ] .",
    "the advantage of our inversion formula over a similar result in  @xcite is that our one - dimensional operator  @xmath26 is a simple pull - back of the classical @xmath27-operator , whereas the operator  @xmath28 in the formula @xmath29 derived in  @xcite is a much more complicated fractional power of the laplacian .",
    "furthermore , as we show in section  [ s : radon ] , the presence of the @xmath27-operator , common in radon theory , is not coincidental : our inversion formula for the convolution  @xmath3 follows directly from the classical radon inversion formula .",
    "in fact , we show in theorem  [ t : ip_radon ] that the spherical mean transform  @xmath0 is , in a sense , more naturally inverted by the classical radon transform .",

    "the intimate connection between  @xmath3 and  @xmath11 elucidated by theorem  [ t : validation ] suggests that instead of using fourier transform to invert  @xmath3 , as we did in section  [ s : fourier ] , we could instead use radon transform .",

    "unfortunately , the same techniques are unlikely to apply to spherical mean transforms with curved centersets .",

    "all symmetric , or _ homogeneous _ , centersets can be enumerated by classifying the one - parameter subgroups of the mbius group of the plane .",

    "] in fact , flat centersets are the most symmetric , followed by spheres .",
    "the symmetry group of a spherical centerset  @xmath334 has lower dimension than that of  @xmath3 .",
    "this means that averages over the spheres centered on a sphere @xmath335 can not be straightforwardly related to _ any _ convolution in  @xmath4 .",
