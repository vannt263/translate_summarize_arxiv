    "the problem of motion , one of the cardinal problems of einstein s gravitation theory , has received continuous attention over the years .",
    "the early , classic works of lorentz - droste , eddington - clark , einstein - infeld - hoffmann , fock , papapetrou and others led to a good understanding of the equations of motion of @xmath7 bodies at the first post - newtonian ( 1pn ) approximationpn order refers to the terms of order @xmath8 in the equations of motion . ]",
    "e.g. _ , @xcite for a general review of the problem of motion ) . in the 1970 s , an important series of works by a japanese group @xcite led to a nearly complete control of the problem of motion at the second post - newtonian ( 2pn ) approximation .",
    "then , in the early 80 s , motivated by the observation of secular orbital effects in the hulse - taylor binary pulsar psr1913 + 16 , several groups solved the two - body problem at the 2.5pn level ( while completing on the way the derivation of the 2pn dynamics ) ( for more recent work on the 2.5pn dynamics see @xcite ) .    in the late 90 s , motivated by the aim of deriving high - accuracy templates for the data analysis of the upcoming international network of interferometric gravitational - wave detectors",
    ", two groups embarked on the derivation of the equations of motion at the third post - newtonian ( 3pn ) level .",
    "one group used the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) hamiltonian approach and worked in a corresponding adm - type coordinate system .",
    "another group used a direct post - newtonian iteration of the equations of motion in harmonic coordinates .",
    "the end results of these two approaches have been proved to be physically equivalent @xcite .",
    "however , both approaches , even after exploiting all symmetries and pushing their hadamard - regularization - based methods to the maximum of their possibilities , left undetermined _ one and only one _ dimensionless parameter : @xmath9 in the adm approach and @xmath4 in the harmonic - coordinates one .",
    "the unknown parameters in both approaches are related by @xmath10 as was deduced from the comparison between the invariant energy functions for circular orbits in the two approaches @xcite , and from two independent proofs of the equivalence between the two formalisms for general orbits @xcite .",
    "the appearance of one ( and only one ) unknown parameter in the equations of motion is quite striking ; it is related with the choice of the regularization method used to cure the self - field divergencies of point particles",
    ". both lines of works and @xcite regularized the self - field divergencies by some version of the hadamard regularization method . the second line of work defined an extended version of the hadamard regularization @xcite , which permitted a self - consistent derivation of the 3pn equations of motion , but its use still allowed for the presence of arbitrary parameters in the final equations . on the other hand , the hadamard regularization also yielded some arbitrary parameters in the gravitational radiation field of point - particle binaries at the 3pn order , the most important of which being the parameter @xmath11 entering the binary s energy flux @xcite .",
    "let us notice that the regularization ( when dealing with point particles ) and the renormalization ( needed when dealing either with point particles or with extended bodies ) of self - field effects has recurrently plagued the general relativistic problem of motion .",
    "even at the 1pn level , early works often contained incorrect treatments of self - field effects ( see , _ e.g. _ , section 6.14 of @xcite for a review ) .",
    "at the 2pn level , the self - field divergencies are more severe than at the 1pn level .",
    "for instance , they caused ref .",
    "@xcite to incorrectly evaluate the `` static '' ( _ i.e. _ , velocity - independent ) part of the 2pn two - body hamiltonian .",
    "the first correct and complete evaluation of the 2pn dynamics has been obtained by using the riesz analytical continuation method @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a detailed discussion of the evaluation of the static 2pn two - body hamiltonian . ) in brief , the riesz analytical continuation method consists of replacing the problematic delta - function stress - energy tensor of a set of point particles @xmath12 , @xmath13^{-1/2 } \\ , \\delta^{(4 ) } ( x^{\\lambda } - y_a^{\\lambda } ( s_a))\\ , , \\label{tdelta4}\\ ] ] [ where @xmath14 , @xmath15 by an auxiliary , smoother source @xmath16^{-1/2 } \\ , z_a^{(4 ) } ( x^{\\lambda } - y_a^{\\lambda } ( s_a))\\ , .",

    "four - dimensional riesz kernel @xmath19 , which depends on the complex number @xmath20 .",
    "when the real part of @xmath20 is large enough the source @xmath21 is an ordinary function of @xmath22 , which is smooth enough to lead to a well - defined iteration of the harmonically relaxed einstein field equations , involving no divergent integrals linked to the behavior of the integrands when @xmath23 .",
    "one then analytically continues @xmath20 down to @xmath24 , where the kernel @xmath19 tends to @xmath25 .",
    "the important point is that it has been shown @xcite that all the integrals appearing in the 2pn equations of motion are meromorphic functions of @xmath20 which admit a smooth continuation at @xmath26 ( without poles ) .",
    "it was also shown there that the formal construction based on ( [ triesz ] ) does generate , at the 2.5pn level , the metric and equations of motion of @xmath7 `` compact '' bodies ( _ i.e. _ , bodies with radii comparable to their schwarzschild radii ) .    the riesz analytic continuation method just sketched works within a normal 4-dimensional space - time ( as recalled by the superscript @xmath27 in ( [ triesz ] ) ) .",
    "however , it was mentioned in @xcite that the same final result ( at the 2.5pn level ) is obtained by replacing @xmath19 by @xmath28 , _",
    "i.e. _ , by formally considering delta - function sources in a space - time of complex dimension @xmath29 .",
    "in other words , at the 2.5pn level , the riesz analytic continuation method is equivalent to the _ dimensional regularization _ method .",
    "however , it was also mentioned at the time @xcite that the generalization of riesz analytic continuation beyond the 2.5pn level did not look straightforward because of the appearance of poles , proportional to @xmath30 , at the 3pn level ( when using harmonic coordinates ) .",
    "recently , damour , jaranowski and schfer @xcite showed how to use dimensional regularization within the adm canonical formalism .",
    "they found that the reduced hamiltonian describing the dynamics of two point masses in space - time dimension @xmath31 was _ finite _ ( no pole part ) as @xmath32 .",
    "they also found that the unique 3pn hamiltonian defined by the analytic continuation of @xmath1 towards 3 had two properties : ( i ) the velocity - dependent terms had the unique structure compatible with global poincar invariance , , originally introduced in the adm approach @xcite , takes the unique value @xmath33 .",
    "this value was obtained in @xcite using the result for the binary energy function in the case of circular orbits , as calculated in the harmonic - coordinates formalism , and also directly from the requirement of poincar invariance in the adm formalism @xcite . ] and ( ii ) the velocity - independent ( `` static '' ) terms led to an unambiguous determination of the unknown adm parameter @xmath9 , namely @xmath34 the fact that the dimensionally regularized 3pn adm hamiltonian ends up being globally poincar invariant is a confirmation of the consistency of dimensional regularization , because this symmetry is not at all manifest within the adm approach which uses a space - plus - time split from the start .",
    "by contrast , the global poincar symmetry is manifest in harmonic coordinates , and indeed the 3pn harmonic - coordinates equations of motion derived in @xcite were found to be manifestly poincar invariant .      in the present paper",
    ", we shall show how to implement dimensional regularization ( henceforth often abbreviated as `` dim .",
    "reg . '' or even `` dr '' ) in the computation of the equations of motion in harmonic coordinates , _",
    "i.e. _ , following the same iterative post - newtonian formalism as in refs .  @xcite .",
    "similarly to the adm calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite , our strategy will essentially consist of computing the _ difference _ between the @xmath1-dimensional result and the 3-dimensional one @xcite corresponding to hadamard regularization .",
    "this difference is computed in the form of a laurent expansion in @xmath35 , where @xmath1 denotes the spatial dimension .",
    "the main reason for computing the @xmath36-expansion of the difference is that it depends only on the singular behavior of various metric coefficients in the vicinity of the point particles , so that the functions involved in the delicate divergent integrals can all be computed in @xmath1 dimensions in the form of local expansions in powers of @xmath37 or @xmath38 ( where @xmath39 ; @xmath40 , @xmath41 , denoting the locations of the two point masses ) .",
    "dimensional regularization as we use it here can then be seen as a powerful argument for completing the 3-dimensional hadamard - regularization results of @xcite and fixing the value of the unknown parameter .",
    "we leave to future work the task of an exact calculation of the @xmath1-dimensional equations of motion , instead of the calculation of the first few terms in a laurent expansion in @xmath36 around @xmath42 , as done here .",
    "the first step towards such a calculation is taken in appendix [ littleg ] , where we give the explicit expression of the basic quadratically non - linear green function @xmath43 in @xmath1 dimensions .    the detailed way of computing the difference between dim .",
    "reg . and hadamard s reg .",
    "will turn out to be significantly more intricate than in the adm case .",
    "this added complexity has several sources .",
    "a first source of complexity is that the harmonic - gauge @xmath1-dimensional calculation will be seen to contain ( as anticipated long ago @xcite ) poles , proportional to @xmath44 , by contrast to the adm calculation which is finite as @xmath32 . a second source of complexity",
    "is that the end results @xcite for the 3-dimensional 3pn equations of motion have been derived using systematically an _ extended _ version of the hadamard regularization method , incorporating both a generalized theory of singular pseudo - functions and their associated ( generalized ) distributional derivatives @xcite , and an improved definition of the finite part as @xmath45 , say @xmath46_1 $ ] , of a singular function @xmath47 , designed so as to respect the global poincar symmetry of the problem @xcite .",
    "we shall then find it technically convenient to subtract the various contributions to the end results of @xcite which arose because of the specific use of the extended hadamard regularization methods of @xcite before considering the difference with the @xmath1-dimensional result .",
    "a third source of added complexity ( with respect to the adm case derived in @xcite and used ( in its @xmath1-dimensional generalization ) in @xcite was written , on purpose , in a way which does not involve any hidden distributional terms ( the only delta - function contributions it contains being explicit contact terms @xmath48 ) .",
    "this allowed one to estimate the difference between the @xmath1-dimensional hamiltonian @xmath49 and the hadamard - regularized 3-dimensional one hr@xmath50 $ ] without having to worry about distributional derivatives .",
    "however , as a check on the consistency of dim .",
    ", the authors of @xcite did perform another calculation of @xmath51 based on a starting form of the hamiltonian which involved hidden distributional terms , with the same final result . ] ) comes from the presence in the harmonic - gauge integrals we shall evaluate of `` hidden - distributional '' terms in the integrands . by hidden distributional terms we mean terms proportional to the second spatial derivatives of the poisson kernel @xmath52 , or to the fourth spatial derivatives of the iterated poisson kernel @xmath53 . such terms , @xmath54 or @xmath55 , considered as schwartz distributional derivatives @xcite , contain pieces proportional to the delta function @xmath56 , which need to be treated with care .",
    "the generalized distributional derivative defined in @xcite , and used to compute the end results of @xcite , led to an improved way , compared to the normal schwartz distributional derivative , of evaluating contributions coming from the product of a singular function and a derivative of the type @xmath57 or @xmath58 , and more generally of any derivatives of singular functions in a certain class .",
    "we shall find it convenient to subtract these additional non - schwartzian contributions to the 3pn equations of motion before applying dimensional regularization .",
    "however , we shall note at the end that dim .",
    "reg . automatically incorporates all of these non - schwartzian contributions .",
    "a fourth , but minor , source of complexity concerns the dependence of the end results of @xcite for the 3pn acceleration of the first particle ( label @xmath59 ) , say @xmath60 , on two arbitrary length scales @xmath61 and @xmath62 , and on the `` ambiguity '' parameter @xmath4 .",
