    "the generalized minimal residual method ( gmres ) @xcite is a popular iterative technique for solving large non - hermitian linear systems .",

    "arioli , ptk , and strakos @xcite gave a complete parametrization for the class of matrices having the same gmres convergence curve .",
    "recently , duintjer tebbens and meurant @xcite showed that any ritz value behavior is possible for prescribed gmres residual norms . since the roots of the polynomials gmres generates to compute its residuals are harmonic ritz values @xcite , it is interesting to investigate the harmonic ritz value behavior for prescribed gmres residual norms .",
    "duintjer tebbens and meurant wrote @xcite it is not clear whether any harmonic ritz value behavior is possible for prescribed gmres residual norms . in this note we show that any admissible harmonic ritz value set ( introduced in  3 ) is possible for prescribed gmres residual norms .",
