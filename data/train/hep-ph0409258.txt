    "the identification of the higgs boson(s ) is one of the main goals of the large hadron collider ( lhc ) being built at cern .",
    "there are expectations that there exists a ` light ' higgs boson with mass @xmath6  gev . in this mass range",
    ", its detection at the lhc will be challenging .",
    "there is no obvious perfect detection process , but rather a range of possibilities , none of which is compelling on its own . _",
    "either _ large signals are accompanied by a huge background , _ or _ the processes have comparable signal and background rates for which the number of higgs events is rather small .    here",
    "we wish to draw attention to the exclusive signal @xmath7 , where the +  sign indicates the presence of a rapidity gap .",
    "it may be possible to install proton taggers so that the ` missing mass ' can be measured very accurately .",
    "the experimental challenge is to provide a set - up in which the bulk of the proton - tagged signal is deposited in a small missing mass window @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the exclusive process allows the mass of the higgs to be measured in two independent ways .",
    "first the tagged protons give @xmath9 and second , via the @xmath10 decay , we have @xmath11 , although now the resolution is much poorer with @xmath12  gev or more .",
    "the existence of matching peaks , centered about @xmath13 , is a unique feature of the exclusive diffractive higgs signal .",
    "besides its obvious value in identifying the higgs , the mass equality also plays a key role in reducing background contributions .",
    "another crucial advantage of the exclusive process @xmath14 , with @xmath10 , is that the leading order @xmath15 background subprocess is suppressed by a @xmath16 , p - even selection rule @xcite .",
    "the basic mechanism for the exclusive process , @xmath14 , is shown in fig .  @xmath17 . since the dominant contribution comes from the region @xmath18",
    "the amplitude may be calculated using perturbative qcd techniques@xcite @xmath19 where the overall normalization constant @xmath20 can be written in terms of the @xmath21 decay width@xcite , and where the @xmath22 vertex factors for cp @xmath23 higgs production are , after azimuthal - averaging , v_h(0^+ ) q_t^2 ,  and   v_a(0 ^ - ) ( p_1",
    "t p_2t)n_0 , [ eq : rat4 ] expressions ( [ eq : m],[eq : rat4 ] ) hold for small @xmath24 , where the @xmath25 are the transverse momenta of the outgoing protons , and @xmath26 is a unit vector in the beam direction . the @xmath27 s are the skewed unintegrated gluon densities at the hard scale @xmath28 , taken to be @xmath29 . since @xmath30 , it is possible to express @xmath31 , to single log accuracy , in terms of the conventional integrated density @xmath32 .",
    "the @xmath27 s embody a sudakov suppression factor @xmath33 , which ensures that the gluon does not radiate in the evolution from @xmath34 up to the hard scale @xmath29 , and so preserves the rapidity gaps .",
    "the apparent infrared divergence of  ( [ eq : m ] ) is nullified for @xmath35 production by these sudakov factors .",
    "however the amplitude for @xmath36 production is much more sensitive to the infrared contribution .",
    "indeed let us consider the case of small @xmath24 of the outgoing protons .",
    "then we see , from  ( [ eq : rat4 ] ) , that the @xmath37 integration for @xmath35 is replaced by @xmath38 for @xmath36 , and now the sudakov suppression is not enough to prevent a significant contribution from the @xmath39 domain .",
    "= 0.4    the radiation associated with the @xmath40 hard subprocess is not the only way to populate and to destroy the rapidity gaps .",
    "there is also the possibility of soft rescattering in which particles from the underlying event populate the gaps .",
    "the probability , @xmath41 at the lhc , that the gaps survive the soft rescattering was calculated using a two - channel eikonal model , which incorporates high mass diffraction@xcite . including this factor , and the nlo @xmath42 factor ,",
    "the cross section is predicted to be @xcite @xmath43 for the production of a standard model higgs boson of mass 120  gev at the lhc .",
    "it is estimated that there may be a factor of 2.5 uncertainty ( up or down ) in this prediction@xcite .",
    "if we include a factor 0.6 for the efficiency associated with proton tagging , 0.67 for the @xmath10 branching fraction , 0.6 for @xmath44 and @xmath45 tagging , 0.5 for the @xmath46 jet polar angle cut , @xmath47 , ( necessary to reduce the @xmath0 qcd background)@xcite , then , for a luminosity of @xmath48 , the original @xmath49 events are reduced to an observable signal of 11 events .",
    "the advantage of the @xmath50 signal is that there exists a @xmath16 selection rule , which requires the leading order @xmath51 background subprocess to vanish in the limit of massless quarks and forward outgoing protons .",
    "( the @xmath52 superscript is to note that each gluon comes from colour - singlet @xmath53-channel exchange . ) however , in practice , lo background contributions remain .",
    "the prolific @xmath54 subprocess may mimic @xmath0 production since we may misidentify the outgoing gluons as @xmath44 and @xmath45 jets . assuming the expected 1% probability of misidentification , and applying @xmath47 jet cut , gives a background - to - signal ratio @xmath55 .",
    "( here , for reference , we assume that the bulk of the higgs signal can be collected within an interval @xmath56 gev . ) secondly , there is an admixture of @xmath57 production , arising from non - forward going protons which gives @xmath58 .",
    "thirdly , for a massive quark there is a contribution to the @xmath16 cross section of order @xmath59 , leading to @xmath55 , where @xmath60 is the transverse energy of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 jets .",
    "next , we have the possibility of nlo @xmath61 background contributions .",
    "of course , the extra gluon may be observed experimentally and these background events eliminated . however , there are exceptions .",
    "the extra gluon may go unobserved in the direction of a forward proton .",
    "this background may be effectively eliminated by requiring the equality @xmath62 . moreover ,",
    "soft gluon emissions from the initial @xmath63 state factorize and , due to the overriding @xmath16 selection rule , these contributions to the qcd @xmath0 production are also suppressed .",
    "the remaining danger is large angle hard gluon emission which is collinear with either the @xmath44 or @xmath45 jet , and therefore unobservable .",
    "if the cone angle needed to separate the @xmath64 jet from the @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) jet is @xmath65 then the expected background from unresolved three jet events leads to @xmath66 .",
    "the nnlo @xmath67 background contributions are found to be negligible ( after requiring @xmath68 ) , as are soft pomeron - pomeron fusion contributions to the background ( and to the signal )  @xcite .",
    "also note that radiation off the screening gluon , in fig .",
    "@xmath17 , is numerically small@xcite .",
    "so , in total , for the exclusive production of a 120 gev ( sm ) higgs boson at the lhc with the integrated luminosity @xmath69 fb@xmath70 , the signal - to - background ratio is s / b  ( 1 /m_missing )  11/4  events , after cuts and acceptance .",
    "this corresponds to a statistical significance of roughly @xmath71 .",
    "that is , if almost the whole higgs signal can be collected within the interval @xmath56 gev , then @xmath72 , corresponding to a @xmath73 signal . in the case of a gaussian missing mass distribution of width @xmath74 ,",
    "about 87% of the signal is contained in a bin @xmath75 , that is @xmath76 .",
    "we could consider higgs production in other diffractive channels , such as diffractive production accompanied by proton dissociation ( @xmath77 ) , or central inelastic production ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "however they are worse than the usual totally inclusive production ",
    "there is no precise missing mass measurement , no selection rule to suppress the background and more serious pile - up problems",
    ". the somewhat smaller density of soft secondary hadrons in the higgs rapidity region does not compensate for the much smaller statistics ( cross sections ) in diffractive processes .",
    "to be specific , we discuss the three neutral higgs bosons of the mssm model : @xmath79 with cp=1 and @xmath80 with cp=1 .",
    "there are regions of mssm parameter space where the conventional signals ( @xmath81 decays ) are suppressed , but where the exclusive subprocess @xmath82 is strongly enhanced@xcite .",
    "for example , for @xmath83 = 130 gev and tan@xmath84 = 50 , we have @xmath85 = 124.4 gev with @xmath86 events , @xmath87 = 135.5 gev with @xmath88 events and @xmath83 = 130 gev with @xmath89 events , so both @xmath90 and @xmath91 should be clearly visible .",
    "( again , for reference , we assume that @xmath56 gev can be achieved . )",
    "the decoupling regime ( @xmath92 and tan@xmath93 ) is another example where the exclusive signal is of great value . in this case",
    "@xmath90 is indistinguishable from a sm higgs , and so the discovery of @xmath91 is crucial to establish the underlying dynamics .",
    "the plot of fig .",
    "@xmath94 , with tan@xmath95 , shows that a @xmath96 signal is possible up to quite large values of @xmath87 .    if the exclusive cross sections for scalar and pseudoscalar higgs production were comparable , it would be possible to separate them readily by a missing mass scan , and by the study of azimuthal correlations between the outgoing protons .",
    "unfortunately pseudoscalar exclusive production is strongly suppressed by the p - even selection .",
    "maybe the best chance to identify the @xmath36 boson is through the double - diffractive process , @xmath97 , where both protons dissociate@xcite .",
    "the exclusive higgs signal is particularly clean , and the signal - to - background ratio is especially favourable , in comparison with the other proposed detection modes . however",
    "the expected number of events is low .",
    "therefore it is important to check the predictions for exclusive higgs production by studying processes mediated by the same mechanism , but with rates which are sufficiently high that they may be observed at the tevatron ( as well as at the lhc ) .",
    "the most obvious examples are those in which the higgs of fig .  @xmath17 is replaced by either a dijet system , a @xmath3 or @xmath4 meson , or by a @xmath5 pair .",
    "first , we discuss the exclusive production of a pair of high @xmath60 jets , @xmath98 @xcite .",
    "this would provide an effective @xmath63 ` luminosity monitor ' just in the kinematical region of the higgs production .",
    "the corresponding cross section was evaluated to be about 10@xmath99 times larger than that for the sm higgs boson .",
    "thus , in principle , this process appears to be an ideal ` standard candle ' .",
    "the expected cross section is rather large , and we can study its behaviour as a function of the mass of the dijet system . unfortunately , in the present cdf environment , the background from ` inelastic pomeron - pomeron collisions ' is large as well . theoretically the exclusive dijets should be observed as a narrow peak , sitting well above the background , in the distribution of the ratio r_jj = e_dijet / e_pp at @xmath100 , where @xmath101 is the energy of the incoming pomeron - pomeron system . in practice",
    "the peak is smeared out due to hadronization and the jet - searching algorithm . for jets with @xmath102 gev and a jet cone @xmath103 ,",
    "more than 1 gev will be lost outside the cone , leading to ( i ) a decrease of the measured jet energy of about 1 - 2 gev , and , ( ii ) a rather wide peak ( @xmath104 ) in the @xmath105 distribution .",
    "the estimates based on ref .",
    "@xcite give an exclusive cross section for dijet production with @xmath106 gev ( and cdf cuts ) of about 40 pb , which is very close to the recent cdf measurement@xcite , ( r_jj>0.8 ,  e_t>25  gev )  =  34  5(stat )  10(syst )  pb .",
    "however there is no ` visible ' peak in the cdf data for @xmath105 close to 1 .",
    "the contribution from other channels ( called central inelastic in ref .",
    "@xcite ) is too large , and matches with the expected peak smoothly jet searching algorithm , rather than the jet cone algorithm , would improve the selection of the exclusive events .",
    "this is in accord with the studies in ref .",
    "@xcite . ] .",
    "an alternative possibility is to measure exclusive double - diffractive @xmath107 production with high @xmath60 photons , that is @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "here there are no problems with hadronization or with the identification of the jets . on the other hand",
    "the exclusive cross section is rather small . as usual ,",
    "the perturbative qcd pomeron is described by two ( reggeized ) gluon exchange .",
    "however the photons can not be emitted from the gluon lines directly .",
    "we need first to create quarks .",
    "thus a quark loop is required , which causes an extra coupling @xmath109 in the amplitude .",
    "the predictions of the cross section for exclusive @xmath5 production are shown in fig .",
    "@xmath110 .",
    "= 0.8    recently the first ` preliminary ' result on exclusive @xmath3 production has been reported@xcite .",
    "although it is consistent with perturbative qcd expectations@xcite , the mass of the @xmath3-boson , which drives the scale of the process , is too low to justify just the use of perturbative qcd and azimuthal angular distributions appear to be in good agreement with the perturbatively based expectations@xcite . ] .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was found that both a regge formalism and perturbative qcd predict essentially the same qualitative behaviour for the central double - diffractive production of ` heavy ' @xmath111 and @xmath112 mesons . due to the low scale , @xmath113 ,",
    "there is a relatively small contribution coming from the process in which the incoming protons dissociate . therefore simply selecting events with a rapidity gap on either side of the @xmath114 ,",
    "almost ensures that they will come from the exclusive reaction , @xmath115 .",
    "although exclusive @xmath114 production is expected to dominate , the predicted@xcite event rates are large enough to select double - diffractive dissociative events with large transverse energy flows in the proton fragmentation regions .",
    "such events are particularly interesting .",
    "first , in this case , the large value of @xmath60 provides the scale to justify the validity , and the reasonable accuracy , of the perturbative qcd calculation of the cross section .",
    "next , by measuring the azimuthal distribution between the two @xmath60 flows , the parity of the centrally produced system can be determined .",
    "another possible probe of the exclusive double - diffractive formalism would be to observe central open @xmath0 production ; namely @xmath116 jets with @xmath117 .",
    "again , this would put the application of perturbative qcd on a sounder footing .",
    "it would allow a check of the perturbative formalism , as well as a study of the dynamics of @xmath0 production .",
    "if the higgs is light , @xmath118 gev , it will be experimentally challenging to study it in detail at the lhc .",
    "all possible processes should be considered .",
    "here we have emphasised the unique advantages of exclusive double - diffractive higgs production , _ provided _ the forward outgoing protons can be precisely tagged .",
    "the missing mass , @xmath119 , measured by the forward proton detectors can then be matched with the mass @xmath120 from the main decay mode , @xmath2 .",
    "moreover the qcd @xmath0 background is suppressed by a @xmath16 selection rule .",
    "the events are clean , but the predicted yield is low : about 10 events , after cuts and acceptance , for an integrated luminosity of @xmath121 .",
    "the signal - to - background ratio is about 1 or better , depending crucially on the accuracy with which @xmath119 can be measured .",
    "we have emphasized the importance of checking these perturbative qcd predictions by observing analogous double - diffractive processes , with larger cross sections , at the tevatron .",
