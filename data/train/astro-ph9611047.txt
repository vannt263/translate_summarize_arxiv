    "active galactic nuclei ( agn ) appear in a variety of forms which include powerful radio emitters produced by highly collimated outflows .",
    "the mechanism(s ) that produces these outflows is(are ) not known , though several models have been suggested ( e.g. blandford & znajek 1977 ; blandford & payne 1982 ; wilson & colbert 1995 ; lightman & eardley 1974 ; rees et al .",

    "powerful extended radio galaxies can be used to probe agn central engines , as described here and by daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "radio sources are referred to as `` powerful '' if their radio powers at 178 mhz satisfy @xmath7 , assuming a deceleration parameter @xmath8 and parameterizing hubble s constant in the usual way : @xmath9 .",
    "these sources are all on the frii ( edge - brightened ) side of the fri - frii break defined by fanaroff & riley ( 1974 ) . they are  extended \" because their core - lobe separations range from about @xmath10 kpc to @xmath11 kpc ( e.g. the radio galaxies listed by wellman , daly , & wan 1997a and 1997b ; hereafter wdw97a and wdw97b ) , which indicate that the outflows are interacting with intergalactic or intracluster gases . only galaxies , and no quasars ,",
    "are considered here to minimize projection effects , since it is widely believed that powerful extended radio galaxies have lobes and bridges that lie closer to the plane of the sky than those of quasars ( see  3.1 below , and wan & daly 1997a ) .",
    "one key to the properties of collimated outflows is the relation between the rate at which energy is channeled into the outflow , known as the beam power or luminosity in directed kinetic energy , and other parameters such as the total time the outflow exists , and the energy available to power the outflow . in an eddington limited system ,",
    "the rate of energy extraction , @xmath12 , is proportional to the mass of the central compact object , @xmath13 .",
    "since the energy available to power the source is equal to the mass of the central compact object times the emission / accretion efficiency , @xmath14 , the total time the outflow exists is @xmath15 .",
    "thus , the total time the outflow exists for an eddington limited system depends only on @xmath16 , and not explicitly on @xmath12 or @xmath17 .",
    "the relation between the beam power and the total time an agn produces collimated outflows is empirically investigated here for the case of powerful extended radio galaxies .",
    "the data can be understood if the total time the agn produces collimated outflows depends on the beam power , and thus , the outflows are not eddington limited systems . the empirical relations obtained here can be used to constrain models of energy extraction from agn , and may provide insight on the conditions at the very core of agn .",
    "the method and model described here can be used to constrain cosmological parameters if the redshift behavior of empirically determined quantities can be estimated to relatively high accuracy ( daly 1994 ) .",
    "the constraints on cosmological parameters that can be placed with the existing data are described in  [ sec : cosmo ] .",
    "modest constraints ( i.e. about 2 @xmath18 ) on a flat , matter - dominated universe may be placed at the present time .",
    "more precise constaints can be placed when the lobe propagation velocity is determined more accurately , or can be observed directly . as described in  [ ssec : confit ] , uncertainties that affect the lobe propagation velocity do not affect , within the errors , the estimate of the model parameter @xmath3 , which relates the beam power and the total time an agn produces collimated outflows .",
    "a basic model that describes the observed characteristics of powerful extended radio sources rather well is presented in  2 .",
    "the radio source samples used in the present study , including their limitations , are described in  3 .",
    "the application of the data to the model , and constraints on the relation between the beam power and the time for which the outflow occurs are detailed in  4 .",
    "the use of current data to estimate and constrain cosmological parameters is discussed in  5 .",
    "a general discussion follows in  6 .",
    "the foundation of a model which describes the lobe separation of powerful extended radio sources is discussed in detail by daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "powerful extended radio sources have regular , straight bridges and lobes that are thought to propagate supersonically outward into the ambient gas surrounding them ( @xcite , hereafter lw84 ; @xcite , hereafter al87 ) .",
    "the lobe propagation velocities are computed on the basis of spectral aging along the bridges ( e.g. myers & spangler 1985 ; leahy , muxlow , & stephens 1989 , hereafter lms89 ; wdw97a , b ) .",
    "it should be noted that results from standard spectral aging have been criticized recently ( katz - stone , rudnick , & anderson 1993 ; rudnick , katz - stone , & anderson 1994 ; rudnick & katz - stone 1996 ; eilek & arendt 1996 ; eilek 1996 ) .",
    "these authors have argued that syncrhotron aging may not be the correct or only explanation for the spectral curvature observed in the bridges of extended radio sources . until more conclusive data are obtained to settle this controversy",
    ", we adopt the practice of using lobe velocities from spectral aging analysis since wdw97b find that these velocities and the inferred surrounding gas temperatures agree well with results from lobe assymetry analysis and x - ray observations .",
    "wdw97a find the data agree well with a model in which the bridges of these sources expand laterally and the plasma inside undergoes adiabatic expansion .",
    "their analysis suggests that the backflow velocity of the plasma within the bridge is small compared to the lobe advance velocity and can be neglected .",
    "it should be noted that backflow can be negligible along quiescent bridges , but significant near the hotspot , in agreement with numerical simulations ( e.g. norman 1996 ) .",
    "the ambient gas density around the lobes of powerful extended radio sources can be estimated on the basis of ram pressure confinement since the lobes propagate supersonically ( see for example daly 1994 , 1995 ; wdw97b ) .",
    "it can be shown that the number density of the ambient gas , @xmath19 , is given by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lobe propagation velocity , @xmath22 is the minimum energy magnetic field , @xmath23 is the offset of the lobe magnetic field , @xmath24 , from minimum energy magnetic field ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 .",
    "wdw97a compute values of @xmath23 for cygnus a by comparing their estimates of pressure in the lobes , pressure in the bridge , and mach number of lobe advance to estimates based on x - ray observations of gas density , thermal pressure and temperature of the surrounding ambient gas .",
    "in particular , each of these three independent estimates gives @xmath27 for cygnus a ( see  [ ssec : datanal ] ) , in agreement with the result of carilli et al .",
    "wdw97b show that the source to source dispersion in @xmath23 must be rather small , less than about @xmath28 .    daly ( 1990 )",
    "derives an expression for the beam power or the luminosity in directed kinetic energy , @xmath1 , by equating the work done by the lobe while it propagates into the ambient gas to the energy supplied by the collimated outflow : @xmath29 and @xmath30 is the lobe width .",
    "it should be noted that the typical @xmath1 for radio galaxies in the sample examined below (  [ ssec : dstsamp ] ) is about @xmath31 assuming @xmath32 , and it appears that @xmath1 is time independent for a given source ( wan , daly , & wellman 1996 ; wan & daly 1997c ) . for a roughly constant @xmath1 ,",
    "the energy supplied by the central engine to power the collimated outflows is @xmath33 where @xmath0 is the lifetime of the collimated outflows .",
    "for @xmath0 between @xmath34 to @xmath35 , which agrees with spectral aging ( e.g. al87 ; lms89 ; liu , pooley , and riley 1992 , hereafter lpr92 ) , the energy supplied by the central engine is @xmath36 . for emission / accretion efficiencies of 0.01 to 0.1 , the mass of the central compact object would be @xmath37 to @xmath38 which is similar to those discussed in models of jet formation in powerful friis ( e.g. wilson & colbert 1995 ) .",
    "the data clearly show that the average lobe - lobe size of powerful extended 3cr ( bennett 1962 ) radio galaxies decreases with redshift for @xmath39 , while the lobe propagation velocity computed on the basis from spectral aging tends to increase with redshift and radio power ( see figure [ fig : phys ] in this paper and figure 19 in wdw97a ) .",
    "also , it appears that there is no relation between radio power and lobe - lobe size at fixed redshift ( e.g. lacy et al .",
    "1993 ; nesser et al . 1995 ; wan & daly 1997b ) .",
    "since the lobe - lobe size is proportional to the lobe propagation velocity times the lifetime , it can be inferred that high redshift 3cr galaxies have shorter lifetimes than low redshift sources .",
    "the higher redshift sources also have larger beam powers than the lower redshift sources since radio power and beam power are roughly proportional ( wan , daly , & wellman 1996 ; wan & daly 1997b ) . a shorter lifetime for a more powerful source",
    "is contrary to what is expected in an eddington limited outflow , since the eddington lifetime depends only upon certain efficiency factors and is independent of the beam power and the total energy of the central compact object . though it should be noted that such an outflow could still be eddington limited if the efficiency factors vary with the beam power .",
    "let the total time that an agn produces two highly collimated oppositely directed outflows be @xmath0 , and let the rate of growth of the radio bridges , @xmath21 , be roughly constant over the source lifetime , which is supported by spectral aging analyses ( al87 , lpr92 , daly 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "the average or characteristic lobe - lobe size a source would have if it could be observed over its entire lifetime is @xmath40 . following daly ( 1994 )",
    ", @xmath0 is related to the energy extraction rate or beam power , @xmath1 , by a power law : @xmath41 this implies that the characteristic source size is @xmath42 where @xmath43 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : beam ] ) .",
    "clearly , for @xmath44 , the average source size depends only upon @xmath19 and @xmath30 , and is independent of @xmath1 , whereas for @xmath45 , the average source size decreases as the beam power and radio power increase .",
    "the implications of eq .",
    "( [ eq : toflj ] ) are far - reaching .",
    "it implies that the total energy available to power the outflow is fixed at some initial value , since @xmath46 , assuming that @xmath1 is roughly constant over the source lifetime which is supported by the current data ( see  2.1 ) .",
    "note that for @xmath47 , the energy extraction rate @xmath1 is independent of the energy @xmath48 available to power the outflow , while for @xmath49 , the beam power and agn lifetime are independent and @xmath50 , analogous to an eddington luminosity .    in practice , @xmath51 is estimated using the expression introduced by daly ( 1994 ) , originally referred to as @xmath52 : @xmath53 the normalization is chosen so that @xmath51 at @xmath54 matches the observed average lobe - lobe size for sources at this redshift that are subject to the power cut discussed in ",
    "[ ssec : avsamp ] . the magnetic field strength , @xmath24 , in a synchrotron - emitting radio source and the lobe propagation velocity based on spectral aging ( myers & spangler 1985 ) , @xmath21 , can be estimated using the field strength that minimizes the total energy in relativistic electrons and magnetic field ( e.g. miley 1980 ) .",
    "the estimates of @xmath24 and @xmath21 can also be computed using magnetic fields systematically offset from the minimum energy field , which is discussed in detail by wdw97a and wdw97b ( see  [ ssec : datanal ] ) .    assuming the energy density of the field in the radio bridge is large compared to that in the microwave background radiation ( i.e. synchrotron losses dominate over inverse compton losses ) and a spectral index of @xmath55 ( @xmath56 ) , it can be shown that @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the redshift of the radio source , and @xmath59 is the coordinate distance to the source .",
    "the value of @xmath3 indicated by the data for all parameter choices is @xmath60 ( see  [ ssec : confit ] ) , and for this value , @xmath61 . the ratio @xmath62 , where @xmath63 is the average lobe - lobe size , has a rather strong dependence on cosmological parameters via @xmath59 : @xmath64 , for @xmath65 .",
    "the results presented in subsequent sections include the effects of inverse compton scattering with microwave background photons and the observed spectral indices , but the assumptions made above show the dependence of @xmath51 on cosmology in one approximation .",
    "the main hypothesis of the model is that single epoch radio data can be used to estimate the average lobe - lobe size the source would have if it could be observed over its entire lifetime , called @xmath51 .",
    "since very powerful frii radio galaxies form a very homogeneous population , the average size of a given source should be close to the average size of the population at the same redshift , as discussed in detail in  [ ssec : rat ] .",
    "thus , one test of the model is whether @xmath51 tracks @xmath63 independent of redshift for a large sample of sources selected using similar criteria ; this is shown to be the case in  [ ssec : confit ] .",
    "if the sources are sampled randomly during their lifetimes , the distribution of @xmath66 should be redshift independent , where @xmath67 is the age of the source when it is observed and @xmath0 is the lifetime of collimated outflows ; this is shown to be the case in  [ ssec : rat ] .",
    "also , if the model correctly describes the data , then the ratio @xmath62 should exhibit much less scatter than the ratio @xmath68 ; this is shown to be the case in  [ ssec : rat ] .",
    "in order to able to use the model described in  [ ssec : tvsl ] , the sources examined must have lobes that propagate supersonically , and have no significant backflows or bridge distortions .",
    "thus , only frii radio galaxies with @xmath69 are examined here .",
    "( see  1 & [ ssec : other ] ) .",
    "radio - loud quasars are not included in this work since the lobe - lobe sizes of radio - loud quasars evolve differently with redshift than radio galaxies ( e.g. @xcite ) , their bridges are more distorted than those of radio galaxies ( lms89 ) , and they may suffer from more serious projection effects .    the 3cr radio galaxies with galactic latitude greater than @xmath70 are completely identified and all have spectroscopic redshifts . on the basis of published 178mhz fluxes and spectral indices compiled by spinrad et al .",

    "@xmath51 is whether the evolution of the radio spectral index with redshift introduces a systematic error on the lobe propagation velocity .",
    "it has been noted for some time that the radio spectral index of the 3cr sample and of other samples increases systematically with redshift ; this could be due to spectral curvature or due to other causes ( e.g. rttgering et al .",

    "it is not clear whether the data should be corrected for the systematic increase of the radio spectral index with redshift .",
    "this correction , referred to as the @xmath89-@xmath58 correction , does not change the low - redshift velocities , but decreases the high - redshift velocities by , at most , a factor of two ( see wdw97a , figure 19 ) .",

    "it is clear from these figures that the constraints on @xmath3 are not significantly affected by the assumed cosmology , and a consistent range of @xmath117 from 1.5 to 2.75 emerges .",
    "most significantly , @xmath97 gives a reduced @xmath115 just slightly greater than 6 , for all cosmologies shown .",
    "thus , taken at face value , the data are not consistent with eddington limited outflows in powerful extended radio sources .",
    "contour plots for the cases b , c , and d described above are also shown in figures [ fig : surfb]a - b , [ fig : surfc]a - b , and [ fig : surfd]a - b respectively . the constraints on @xmath3 are not significantly different for the four cases ( a - d ) examined , and all cases give a high reduced @xmath115 , greater than 3 , for @xmath97 .",
    "note that these figures only depict the range of @xmath5 from 0 to 1 , but fits have been extended outside this range , including @xmath123 which gives divergent values of the coordinate distance , @xmath59 , for @xmath124 ( see table [ tb : om ] ) .",
    "table [ tb : om ] shows the best fit values of @xmath5 and @xmath3 for a constant @xmath63/@xmath51 independent of redshift .",
    "the fits for @xmath5 vary by about 0.2 to 0.4 depending on the case ( a - d ) described above , which follows from figures [ fig : surfa]-[fig : surfd ] . a value of @xmath5 less than unity",
    "is indicated by these fits for all parameter choices , and @xmath125 is inconsistent at about the @xmath6 level .",
    "these constraints on @xmath5 are as strong as those from studies of large scale velocity fields which indicate that @xmath126 at about the @xmath127 level ( e.g. dekel et .",

    "the use of radio powerful extended radio galaxies to constrain cosmological parameters is discussed further in  [ sec : cosmo ] below .",
    "table [ tb : pow ] shows the results of fitting @xmath63/@xmath51 to a power law in @xmath94 , @xmath63/@xmath128 .",
    "a value of @xmath129 is expected for the correct parameter choices ( see  [ ssec : rat ] ) .",
    "best fit values for @xmath3 and @xmath130 are shown for the four cases described above ( a - d ) and three choices of cosmological parameters .",
    "it is interesting to note that the fits for @xmath3 converge to similar values for different cosmologies when a power law fit is allowed .",
    "the fits where ( @xmath118 ) are the only ones that give a significantly non - zero value of @xmath130 , in which case @xmath130 is about @xmath6 less than zero .",
    "figures [ fig : ratio]a , [ fig : ratio]b , and [ fig : ratio]c show the ratio @xmath63/@xmath51 and the best fit to a constant ( the weighted mean in log - space ) , assuming @xmath32 without the @xmath89-@xmath58 correction and @xmath93 , for ( @xmath118 ) , ( @xmath119 ) , and ( @xmath120 ) respectively .",
    "the slopes found in the power law fits for ( @xmath118 ) are apparent in figure [ fig : ratio]a , and can be explained by the incorrect choice of cosmological parameters .",
    "this implies that if the universe is flat and matter - dominated , then there is some redshift evolution that has not been accounted for .",
    "the possibility that certain sources in the @xmath51 sample may not be representative of powerful extended radio sources at their respective redshifts was considered .",
    "for example , the only low redshift source for which we have an estimate of @xmath51 is cygnus a ( 3c405 , @xmath73 ) ; perhaps cygnus a is an unusual source .",
    "a source that is similar to cygnus a in many respects , including size , lobe propagation velocity , surrounding ambient gas density , and ambient gas temperature , is 3c427.1 ( wdw97a ,",
    "b ) . also , two sources , 3c68.2 and 3c239 , do not seem to follow the predictions of adiabatic bridge expansion , according to wdw97a .",
    "all of the analyses described above have been repeated while excluding different combinations of these sources ( 3c405 , 3c427.1 , 3c68.2 , and 3c239 ) , and the differences are negligible except for a slight reduction of @xmath117 by about 0.3 when 3c427.1 is excluded holding all other parameters fixed .",
    "the reduction of @xmath117 when 3c427.1 is excluded occurs because lower @xmath3 tends to make 3c427.1 an outlier ( see figures [ fig : dst]a , b ) .",
    "the data give an estimate of @xmath3 that is insensitive to virtually all other parameter choices and data cuts . a reasonable estimate of @xmath3",
    "is @xmath131 based on figures [ fig : surfa]-[fig : surfd ] and tables 3 - 5 .",
    "it is safe to state that @xmath3 must be between 1 and 3 , and that these outflows are not eddington limited , @xmath132 .",
    "the main conclusion that can be drawn about cosmological parameters is that a flat , matter - dominated universe ( @xmath118 ) is about @xmath6 away from the best fit values ( see  [ sec : cosmo ] below ) .",
    "in order to be able to use the model outlined in  [ ssec : tvsl ] to estimate cosmological parameters , accurate estimates of @xmath30 , @xmath24 , and @xmath21 are needed ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dofobs ] ) .",
    "though two inputs to @xmath21 are not completely understood at this time , it is still interesting to apply the method to this data set and consider all possible effects on @xmath21 to see the implications for cosmological parameters .",
    "one factor that is not completely understood is the offset of magnetic field strength from the minimum energy value .",
    "this enters as a scaling factor of @xmath24 and only affects the redshift behavior of @xmath51 through the redshift behavior of @xmath21 .",
    "it turns out that the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath21 is rather weak for @xmath60 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : dofobs ] ) : @xmath133 , but the effect of the offset from minimum energy conditions on @xmath21 is considered nonetheless .",
    "as the magnetic field strength decreases from the minimum energy value , the role of inverse compton cooling begins to become important relative to the role of synchrotron cooling in these sources .",
    "the affects of both types of cooling on the radio spectral index is used to estimate spectral ages , and thus @xmath21 . as discussed by wdw97b , for @xmath134 ,",
    "the 2 cooling mechanisms are of comparable importance for many sources at high redshift .",
    "this offset affects both the redshift behavior of the @xmath21 ( shown in figure 4 of wdw97b ) , and the dependence of @xmath51 on @xmath135 , the coordinate distance to the source .",
    "the second effect that may change estimates of the lobe propagation velocity is the increase of the radio spectral index with redshift .",
    "it is not clear whether the data should be corrected to account for the observed systematic increase of the radio spectral index with redshift ( discussed in detail by wdw97b ) . for 3cr radio galaxies ,",
    "@xmath21 increases with redshift , as do the radio power and the radio spectral index .",
    "this increase is well known and has been noted by many authors . if , for example , the initial radio spectrum is not a power law but has some curvature ( see e.g. rttgering et al . , 1994 ) , the observed spectral index should be corrected for the observed redshift evolution as was done for the @xmath89 corrected data ( wdw97b ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if the correlation is not due to , or only partly due to , spectral curvature than such a correction is not appropriate .    to account for these two uncertainties ,",
    "both @xmath32 and @xmath136 are considered , and both @xmath89-@xmath58 corrected and @xmath89-@xmath58 uncorrected velocities are considered ( see  [ ssec : confit ] ) .",
    "the results are not strongly dependent on these changes ( see table [ tb : om ] ) , as expected since @xmath137 .",
    "the effect of using a value of @xmath86 instead of @xmath32 is to increase the best fit @xmath5 by about 0.2 and the effect of including the corrections to spectral index is to lower the best fit @xmath5 by about 0.2 ( see table [ tb : om ] ) . a _",
    "precise _ fit for @xmath5 can not be made until the parameters that are varied between the four cases ( a - d ) described in  4.3 are known .",
    "however , the current range of @xmath5 allowed can be discussed .",
    "an ideal solution to the uncertainties described above would be to identify an independent estimate of the lobe propagation velocity for all or some of these sources .",
    "this could be compared with the lobe propagation velocity estimated using the spectral aging model used here .",
    "the velocity can be independently estimated if either the ambient gas temperature or the ambient gas density can be estimated .",
    "wdw97a have shown that the geometrical shape of the radio bridge may be used to estimate the mach number of the lobe , so the combination of the mach number and the ambient gas temperature can be used to estimate the lobe propagation velocity .",
    "perhaps observations by axaf will be used to measure the ambient gas temperature since its spatial resolution and spectral coverage could allow it to separate x - rays produced by the agn from those produced by thermal bremsstrahlung from the hot ambient gas .",
    "daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) and wdw97b have shown that the lobe propagation velocity and lobe pressure may be used to estimate the ambient gas density ; if the ambient gas density can be estimated independently , the lobe pressure and ambient gas density may be combined to solve for the lobe propagation velocity .",
    "studies of the gaseous environments of these sources using the sunyaev - zeldovich effect or high resolution axaf measurements may lead to independent estimates of the ambient gas density , which may be combined with the lobe pressure to solve for the lobe propagation velocity .",
    "a relation between the active lifetime during which an agn produces a highly collimated outflows , @xmath0 , and the beam power @xmath1 , is introduced which can reconcile the observed evolution of radio source size with redshift , and the independence of radio source size and radio power at a given redshift for powerful extended radio sources ( see  [ ssec : tvsl ] ) .",
    "what emerges from this model is a characteristic length scale , @xmath51 , that can be thought of as the lobe - lobe size averaged over a source s lifetime , which can be predicted from measurable quantities such as the lobe width , the lobe propagation velocity , and the lobe magnetic field strength .",
    "the model parameter @xmath3 , which relates @xmath0 and @xmath1 , is estimated by comparing the redshift evolution of @xmath51 to that of the average lobe - lobe sizes for powerful extended radio galaxies .",
    "for all the cases and cosmologies considered , a consistent range of @xmath3 emerges (  [ ssec : confit ] ) .",
    "the best fit values allow @xmath3 to range from about 1.5 to 2.75 , so a good rough estimate of @xmath3 is @xmath138 .",
    "this is consistent with the range of @xmath139 obtained by daly ( 1994 , 1995 ) .",
    "these data are not consistent with @xmath97 , which is expected for an eddington limited system ( @xmath0 independent of @xmath1 as discussed in  [ ssec : tvsl ] ) . in figure",
    "[ fig : dst]a , where @xmath95 is assumed , the @xmath51 estimates are clearly increasing with redshift , which is opposite the evolution of @xmath63 for the high - power 3cr sample described in  [ ssec : avsamp ] .",
    "the data are best fit with @xmath140 which yield reduced @xmath115 s less than 1.5 , whereas fits assuming @xmath97 yield reduced @xmath115 s greater than 3 ( see figures [ fig : surfa]-[fig : surfd ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath3 obtained here imply that @xmath51 should decrease for increasing @xmath1 or @xmath21 ( see  [ ssec : tvsl ] ) , which is consistent with the redshift evolution of the average sizes of high - power 3cr sources ( figure [ fig : phys ] ) , and the redshift evolution of @xmath1 and @xmath21 ( discussed by wan & daly 1997b ) .    a flat , matter - dominated universe ( @xmath118 ) is allowed at about the @xmath6 level for the full range of parameter allowed .",
    "it should be noted that the significance of the constraints on @xmath5 obtained here are similar to those obtained from the study of the large scale velocity fields ( e.g. dekel et .",
    "al 1993 , dekel & rees 1994 , hudson et .",
    "al 1995 ) .",
    "stronger cosmological constraints can be placed using this method when the lobe propagation velocity can be more accurately determined , as discussed in ",
    "[ sec : cosmo ] , or can be measured directly by comparing x - ray temperature measurements with the shape of the radio bridge , as described by wdw97a , or by comparing the x - ray density or sunyaev - zeldovich pressure with the pressure of the radio lobe , as described by wdw97b .",
