    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are well known for their extreme electromagnetic emission ( reaching values of radiating powers up to 10@xmath2 ) , which is spread over the whole spectrum ( from radio to x - rays bands ) .",
    "this emission presents , in some cases , a peak in the uv region and significant emission in the x - rays and infrared bands .",
    "most agns , and blazars in particular , are characterized by variability in their optical flux .",
    "the time - scales of these changes span a range from days to years , but variations on time - scales of hours or minutes also take place .",
    "this latter phenomenon is known as _ microvariability _ , and it has been studied and reported by several authors in the last decades ( e.g. ; @xcite ) .",
    "microvariability studies provide important information about size limits for the emitting regions and can provide constraints on different models of the electromagnetic emission .",
    "however , spurious variability results may be obtained due to : ( i ) systematic errors introduced by contamination from the host galaxy light @xcite ; ( ii ) inappropriate observing / photometric methodologies @xcite , and ( iii ) the inadequate use of statistical methods for the detection of variability @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we focus on the last item . in the literature",
    ", we may find a great diversity of statistical tests used to assess the significance of variability results .",
    "the most commonly used are : the @xmath3 test , which compares a sample variance of the possibly variable target with a theoretically calculated variance for a non - variable object , proposed by @xcite , and used both for photometric and polarimetric time series (; ) ; the one way analysis of variance ( anova ) , which is a family of tests that compare the means of a number of samples ; the @xmath0 criterion , which involves the ratio of standard deviations of two distributions ( @xcite ; ; ; @xcite ) ; and the @xmath1 test , which takes into account the ratio between the variances of two distributions @xcite .",
    "contradictory and diverse results are usually obtained from these statistics , and it is of course desirable that the classification of the state of variability of a certain source should be independent from the statistical method used . in order to find the most reliable test to study variability , we took advantage of a significantly large data set of agn microvariability observations obtained with the same instrumental setup and reduced in a homogeneous way .    in section  [ sec : odr ]",
    ", we present the sample of agns and the method to generate the differential light curves ( dlcs ) . in section  [",
    "sec : stsv ] , we describe the @xmath0 and @xmath1 statistics , respectively , and we present our results , making a comparison between tests . in section  [ sec : iicc ] , we make a deeper study on the @xmath0 criterion . in section  [ sec : discu ] , we present the results of the implementation of both statistics to the field stars , and finally , in section  [ sec : summ ] we discuss the results found and summarize our conclusions .",
    "appendix  [ apendice ] describes in detail the @xmath4 test mentioned in section 4.1 .",
    "we worked with a sample of 23 southern agns reported in , and 20 egret blazars , studied by .",
    "the data in both papers were based on observations taken with the 2.15 m jorge sahade  telescope , casleo , argentina , between 1997 april and 2001 july .",
    "the telescope was equipped with a _ liquid - nitrogen - cooled _ ccd camera , using a tek-1024 chip with a gain of 1.98 electrons / adu and a _ read - out noise _ of 9.6 electrons .",
    "focal - reducer _ providing a scale of 0.813 arcsec pixel@xmath5 was also used . since",
    "three sources are repeated in both samples , and the object pks1519@xmath6273 was excluded because the original data could not be recovered , we have studied a total sample of 39 agn .    in the original publications , objects were classified as : _ quasars _ ( qso ) , within which there are the _ radioquiet _  ( rqq ) and _ radioloud _  ( rlq ) ; and _ bllac objects _ , which have been categorised in _ radio - selected _  ( rbl ) and in _ x - rays - selected _   ( xbl ) .",
    "after several revisions , and following the publication of the first catalogue of the satellite instrument _ fermi-_lat ( large area telescope ; @xcite ) , the blazars are now broadly divided into bllacs and flat - spectrum radio quasars ( fsrq ) , and further sub - classified based on the frequency at which the synchrotron peak of the spectral energy distribution falls , as : _ low synchrotron peak _ , lsp blazars , _ intermediate synchrotron peak _ ,",
    "isp blazars , and _ high synchrotron peak _ , hsp blazars @xcite .",
    "the sample of agns is presented in table  [ tab : obj ] , where we give the name of the source , type of agn , right ascension ( @xmath7 ) , declination ( @xmath8 ) , redshift ( @xmath9 ) and the visual magnitude ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "these values were taken from the nasa / ipac extragalactic database and from the references cited in the table .",

    "+      the statistical analysis is made on dlcs .",
    "these curves are obtained by applying standard differential photometry techniques , as were developed by @xcite .",
    "the observations involve repeated short exposures of a certain field that contains the source of interest .",
    "other stars in the frame are used for comparison and control in the reduction process , which results in instrumental magnitudes of all the objects .",
    "the principal advantage of differential photometry is that there is no need for perfect photometric nights .",
    "following @xcite , the source of interest is designed by v , and a comparison and a control stars by c and k , respectively .",
    "it is important to highlight that both stars should not be variable .    with the instrumental magnitudes , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are calculated",
    ", being the last one important because ( i ) variability in the comparison and/or control star can be detected ; ( ii ) intrinsic instrumental precision is measured , and ( iii ) it provides a comparison to determine whether the light curve of the source is variable or not .",
    "several objects of the sample have been observed along more than one night , making a total of 78 data sets ( i.e. each data set corresponds to observations taken along one night for a given object ) . for each set",
    ", we generated a dlc , using the software iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) .",
    "for the photometry , we used an optimal aperture radius , which is determined taking into account the apparent size and the brightness of the host galaxy , when appropriate @xcite . for almost all the agns in the sample",
    ", we took the same radius of 6.5  , except for pks1622@xmath6297 for which we used a radius of 3.5   because the field of this object is particularly crowded .    in this work , unlike what was done by , who constructed mean  comparison and control stars from three stars in each frame , we followed the recommendation given by @xcite , who used one comparison and one control stars .",
    "the criterion proposed by these authors suggests that the magnitude of the control star must be as similar as possible to the magnitude of the object , meanwhile for the comparison star , the magnitude should be slightly brighter than the other two . comparing both criteria",
    ", we found that the criterion established by @xcite is more conservative than the one proposed by ( see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the use of mean stars improves the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) relation of the control@xmath6comparison  light curves and this may lead to an overestimation of the agn variability .",
    "thus , choosing a pair of candidates to control and comparison stars , we generated the dlcs ( object@xmath6comparison  and control@xmath6comparison  ) using a reduction package of iraf ( apphot ) , and we analysed both curves , searching for a control@xmath6comparison  light curve with the minimum possible dispersion , while , at the same time , fulfilling the above - explained conditions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : examp ] , we show two extreme examples of the light curves obtained ( the light curves are as fig .  1 in and fig .  4 in , respectively ) .    752 , undetected variability . in both cases",

    "in this section , we will analyse two statistical methods most widely used to quantify variability in agn light curves : the @xmath0 and @xmath1 statistics .",
    "this is a criterion that contemplates the ratio of the standard deviations of the object@xmath6comparison  and control@xmath6comparison  light curves , @xmath21 and @xmath22 respectively ; the @xmath0 parameter is defined as :    @xmath23    if @xmath0 is greater than a critical value ( i.e. @xmath24 ) , the light curve of the source is said to be variable with a 99.5 per cent confidence level ( cl ) .      @xcite define a scale factor , @xmath25 , to be applied when no comparison and control stars , meeting the criterion mentioned in section 2.1 , are found in the field .",
    "it takes into account the different relative brightnesses between the agn and the comparison and control stars .",
    "this is so because the budget of photometric errors includes flux - dependent terms , as well as terms that are the same for all objects , irrespective of their magnitudes ( sky and read - out noise ) .",
    "this factor is given by @xcite ,    @xmath26    where @xmath27 are the fluxes in adu for the object , control and comparison stars , respectively ; and @xmath28 takes into account the sky photons and the read - out noise .",
    "the scale factor calculation is made by an estimation of the ratio between @xmath29 ( variance of the object@xmath6comparison  curve predicted by the ccd - based error equation and the median v and c measurements ) and @xmath30 , through the properties of the ccd used ( i.e. gain and read - out noise ) , as well as a proper weighting of the counts for each object and for the sky ( see * ? ? ? * for details ) .",
    "then , the scaled @xmath0 parameter results :    @xmath31    this weight factor is important since , in many cases , the fields are not very populated , limiting the choice of the comparison and control stars . in those cases , there is an error term that is an increasing function of the difference between the magnitudes of the objects .",
    "the use of the @xmath25 factor compensates for such differences .      in this statistic",
    ", it is assumed that errors in the curves are distributed normally and their associated distributions need not have the same degrees of freedom .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is defined as :    @xmath32    where @xmath33 is the variance of the object@xmath6comparison  light curve , and @xmath34 that of the control@xmath6comparison  curve .",
    "the calculated @xmath1 values are compared with critical values @xmath35 , which have an associated significance level , @xmath7 , and degrees of freedom of the different distributions .",
    "the degrees of freedom can be described as the number of scores that are free to vary , while @xmath36 is the cumulative probability of the distribution . in our case ,",
    "the degrees of freedom are associated with the number of points in the object@xmath6comparison  light curve , @xmath37 , and in the control@xmath6comparison , @xmath38 , where @xmath39 , resulting in @xmath40 degrees of freedom .",
    "then , if the parameter @xmath41 , the null hypothesis of the test ( i.e. statistical equality between the variances when there is no significant difference between them ) is rejected , meaning that the curve is classified as variable .      as for the @xmath42criterion , there is also a scaled version of the @xmath43test ; in fact , this was the expression originally proposed by @xcite .",
    "thus , the weighted parameter @xmath1 is :    @xmath44    @xcite propose an alternative to the @xmath25 corrective factor : they scale the variance @xmath34 by a factor @xmath45 , which is defined as the ratio of the average square errors of the individual points in the dlcs .",
    "the main difference between @xmath25 and @xmath45 is that the first is obtained from mean values of object fluxes and sky counts for each light curve , while the second takes into account individual error bars for each data point .",
    "since the relevant input parameters are basically the same in both cases , they should provide similar results .",
    "we present in table [ tab : resul ] the results of applying the @xmath0 criterion and the @xmath1 test to the sample of agn light curves .",
    "we show the object name , date , the number of points in the light curve ( @xmath46 ) , the values of @xmath0 without / with weight ( @xmath0 and @xmath47 ) , the values of @xmath1 without / with weight ( @xmath1 and @xmath48 ) , the dispersion of the control - comparison  light curve multiplied by @xmath25 and the weight factor @xmath25 .",
    "the last column gives the area to the left of the observed @xmath1 below the @xmath1 density distribution , for the adopted 99.5 per cent@xmath6cl .",
    "a value of area-@xmath49 means that the null@xmath6hypothesis ( non - variable ) should be rejected .",

    "while the @xmath1 test seems to be more sensitive to classify as variable curves with these characteristics , the ks test gives 1-prob@xmath66 for the var / var versus nvar / var histograms ( figs  [ fig : hdt]a and b ) , meaning that we can not claim that the distributions are statistically different .",

    "_ dispersion of the control@xmath6comparison dlc : _ in those cases in which the state of variability is maintained ( i.e. , var / var and nvar / nvar ; figs  [ fig : hs2]a and c ) , we observe that the distributions of @xmath69 clump below @xmath70 mag . this implies dlcs with low instrumental dispersion , i.e. with high s / n ratio .",
    "the variability detection in these dlcs ( non@xmath6detection in the case of nvar / nvar ) is thus robust .",
    "however , for the nvar / nvar case , there is a tail of dlcs with @xmath71mag .",
    "this means low s / n ratio ; hence , any intrinsic agn variability of low amplitude would be masked by the , relatively , high noise .",
    "the distribution of nvar / nvar cases is broader than that for var / var ( the ks test gives a value 1-prob@xmath72 , i.e. it can not be said that the var / var and nvar / nvar histograms are statistically different ) .",
    "this would imply a slightly larger sensitivity of the @xmath1 test to detect variability in noisy dlcs ( or , from a different point of view , a higher tendency to produce false positives under low s / n conditions ) .",
    "we also made an analysis of the light curves obtained after interchanging the roles of the comparison and control stars , in order to study how the choice of these stars could influence the statistical results .",
    "we applied both parameters to the dlcs , finding out that close to the 95 per cent of the light curves maintained their classifications with the @xmath0 criterion ; meanwhile , for the @xmath1 test that percentage dropped to 85 per cent .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the mean value of @xmath25 is close to @xmath73 , with a low dispersion .",
    "however , again , @xmath1 seems more sensitive to systematics than @xmath0 .",
    "as defined in section [ ctest_def ] , the parameter @xmath0 is the ratio between the standard deviations of two given distributions .",
    "the genesis of its use in agn microvariability studies can be traced back to @xcite who proposed that the dispersion of the differential magnitudes of the control light curve could provide an estimator for the stability of the standard stars used in the data analysis , being a more reliable measure of the observational uncertainty than formal photometric errors .",
    "a further step was given by @xcite ; they fitted both object@xmath6comparison  and control@xmath6comparison  light curves with straight lines and computed the standard deviations of the data points in each curve .",
    "the largest value , either from one or from the other light curve , was taken as a measure of the observational error .",
    "note that this procedure removes any long - term variation in the light curves , while , at the same time , is insensitive to any erratic , low@xmath6amplitude variation  of the agn @xcite .",
    "@xcite explicitly use the 99 per cent cl for magnitude variations with _ amplitudes _",
    "exceeding @xmath74 , corresponds to 99.5 per cent ( see below ) .",
    "] assuming a normal distribution . in , an explicit definition for @xmath0 is given ( equation  [ eq : c ] ) , where the amplitude of the target@xmath6comparison dlc has been changed by its dispersion , in an attempt to compensate for the extreme sensibility of the @xcite criterion to systematic ( mostly type - i ) errors ( the practical reason for this choice is illustrated in section  [ sec : discu ] ) .",
    "thus , the parameter @xmath0 is the result of trying to improve the estimation of the data errors , providing a variability criterion as strong as possible against false positives arising from systematic errors .",
    "however , we saw above that the @xmath0 criterion gives different results than the @xmath1 test . since the @xmath1 test is firmly rooted in a statistical theoretical background , whereas the @xmath0 is a rather loosely grounded criterion ( that eventually got to be considered as an actual test ) , we decided to carefully analyse the latter .",
    "putting aside for the moment the particular case of comparing light curves , in a general setup the goal of both the @xmath0 and the @xmath1 statistics is to compare the dispersions ( @xmath0 criterion ) or variances ( @xmath1 test ) of two samples , taken from unknown populations . both carry out the comparison by rejecting ( or not ) the null hypothesis that both dispersions and variances are statistically the same",
    "let @xmath75 , and @xmath76 , where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the dispersions being compared , with @xmath77 in the case of the @xmath1 statistic .",
    "we discard here any explicit scaling factor , because we are not computing results of the tests but comparing them , so the numerical values of the dispersions are irrelevant here .",
    "density distribution , here with @xmath78 , @xmath79 , i.e. the sample with the larger dispersion has 21 measurements , and the other one 16 . the cl is chosen here as @xmath80 , which gives a value of @xmath81 . if it turns out that @xmath82 , the null hypothesis is rejected ; otherwise , the null hypothesis is not rejected.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    in order to make a theoretically based comparison between the methods , we recall here the procedure for the @xmath1 test .",
    "first , we have to choose a cl @xmath7 , that is , the complement of the probability that two variances will give by chance an @xmath1 value so large that the null hypothesis should be rejected .",
    "if , for example , one chooses 1 per cent as the above@xmath6mentioned probability , then @xmath83 . secondly ,",
    "the degrees of freedom  @xmath84 are computed , where @xmath85 are the number of measurements of each sample .",
    "thirdly , by using the probability density distribution of the statistical variable @xmath1 with @xmath86 and @xmath87 degrees of freedom , a value @xmath88 is found , such that the area below the distribution mentioned before to the left of @xmath88 be @xmath7 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : fisher ] ) .",
    "fourthly , a value @xmath89 is computed from the measurements , by using for each sample the usual formula    @xmath90    where @xmath46 is the size of the sample , @xmath91 are the measurements , and @xmath92 is the mean of the sample , i.e. , the sum of the measurements divided by @xmath46 .",
    "finally , @xmath93 is compared against @xmath88 .",
    "if @xmath82 , then the null hypothesis is rejected ; otherwise , the null hypothesis is not rejected .    in turn , for the case of @xmath0 we have : first , the value @xmath94 is computed from the measurements , using the square root of equation ( [ sigma ] ) for each sample . secondly ,",
    "this value is ( always ) compared with the number 2.576 , irrespective of the number of measurements .",
    "if @xmath95 , the null hypothesis is rejected at a fixed 99.5 per cent cl .",
    "so , the @xmath0 test  is not properly a statistical test .",
    "tracing back the origin of the fixed numbers 2.576 and 99.5 per cent , it seems that they come from a standard _ rejection of a bad measurement procedure_. according to this , given a set of measurements of a given quantity , we can always compute the variance of the sample by means of equation ( [ sigma ] ) . under the hypotheses that the measurements came with a gaussian distribution of errors , and that the mean and the dispersion of the sample are good estimators of the true mean and dispersion of the population of measurements , one might discard those measurements that fall far enough from the mean of the sample because those measurements can be regarded highly improbable ( some instrumental or operational error rather than to an error by chance )",
    ". how far they should be from the mean in order to be discarded depends on the experiment ; usually , this distance is measured in units of the dispersion of the sample .",
    "if this distance is taken as @xmath96 , for instance , it is said that the measurement is rejected at a 68 per cent cl , because the area below a gaussian inside the abscissae @xmath97 is approximately 0.68 .",
    "but we may invert the argument and put forward a cl , finding what is the abscissa that gives that area .",
    "if one chooses , for example , 0.995 as the level , then one obtains @xmath98 ( @xmath0 critical value ) .    in this way",
    ", @xmath0 is not a strict , theoretically supported statistical estimator . describes a possible implementation of a statistical test based on the ratio of dispersions of two distributions . ]",
    "as we have seen , the rejection of a bad measurement works by comparing a given measurement with the _ mean of the distribution density of the measurements _ , and measuring the distance to that mean in terms of the _ dispersion of the distribution density of the measurements_. in the @xmath0 criterion , however , a dispersion @xmath21 is compared with a reference dispersion @xmath22 , as if this last value were the mean of the distribution density of dispersions , and the ratio @xmath99 becomes the distance , as if @xmath22 were also the dispersion of the distribution density of dispersions .",
    "that is , for the @xmath0 criterion to work , @xmath22 should be both the mean and the dispersion of the ( unknown ) distribution of dispersions . and",
    ", it should be pointed out that , whereas @xmath0 is strictly positive , and clearly the domain of a distribution density of dispersions is the set of positive reals plus zero , the @xmath0 criterion assumes a gaussian distribution of dispersions , i.e. , a domain equal to the set of all real numbers .",
    "to better understand the results presented in section  [ sec : stsv ] , we analysed the stability of the statistics using the field stars . to perform this",
    ", we considered all the selected stars in the frames , excluding the agn , and we calculated the @xmath0 and @xmath1 parameters for all the dlcs using the same comparison and control stars as in the case of the corresponding agn . by _ selected _ stars , we mean those ( between 6 and 44 per field ) making the set of candidates from which the comparison and control stars were finally chosen .",
    "we removed from this sample dlcs that were affected by saturation , cosmic rays , stars that were too close to the edge of the frames and any other evident defect .",
    "dlcs with @xmath100mag were also discarded ; this should remove any remaining very ill - behaving dlc as well as known variables ( e.g. , star s in the field of 3c279 , a known variable with amplitude @xmath101mag ; * ? ? ?",
    "the original number of dlcs was @xmath102 , and after the cleaning process , we had 981 dlcs left for their study .",
    "the first thing to note is that 16.9 per cent of the dlcs are found to be variable with the @xmath1 test , while this percentage drops to 9.5 per cent using the @xmath0 criterion ( in both cases , the @xmath25 correction was applied ) .",
    "it is known ( e.g. * ? ? ? * and references therein ) that the fraction of variable stars in a given survey is a function of the survey parameters @xmath6time span and sampling of the observational series , photometric precision@xmath6 , as well as the magnitudes , spectral types and luminosity classes of the stars . as a general guide , from ground - based data",
    ", @xcite says that only 7 per cent of the stars are expected to vary at a 0.01 mag precision level .",
    "@xcite , in turn , present a detailed variability analysis based on _ kepler _ data , with a time resolution @xmath103min . from their results , it can be inferred that the fraction of stars in our agn fields ( mostly located at relatively high galactic latitudes ) that vary at a level @xmath104mag within a few hours should be almost negligible @xmath6at most , well below 10 per cent .",
    "it is clear that both criteria classify as variable  a larger@xmath6than@xmath6expected number of dlcs .",
    "however , this is particularly evident for the @xmath1 test : 76 out of 981 dlcs ( 7.7 per cent ) change form nvar with the @xmath0 criterion to var using the @xmath1 test ( the converse holds for a negligible 0.3 per cent , i.e. , just three dlcs , so we do not discuss this var / nvar case ) . in order to further inquire into the reasons for this behaviour , we again analysed the distribution of the different parameters characterizing the dlcs , as was done for the agn light curves .",
    "the general results are qualitatively similar to those presented in sections  [ sec : distri ] and [ sec : histos ] .",
    "however , it is worth mentioning that the most significant differences between distributions ( supported by the ks test ) correspond to the ratio between the variability amplitude ( @xmath53 ) and the scaled rms of the control light curve ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "while dlcs in the nvar / nvar case cluster at @xmath106 , those in the var / var case have a broad distribution from @xmath107 upwards ; the nvar / var case , in turn , shows a narrow distribution centred at @xmath108 . for the observed dlcs of the agn sample",
    ", we obtained a similar result regarding the behaviour of the ratio @xmath109 ( also supported by the ks test ) .",
    "this means that both parameters agree in their classification for almost all dlcs displaying variations with amplitudes above @xmath110 ( var / var ) , and for most dlcs with @xmath111 ( nvar / nvar ) , while a minor fraction of dlcs lying within a narrow range around the limiting value ( @xmath112 ) are classified as variable by the @xmath1 test and non - variable by the @xmath0 criterion .",
    "thus , both parameters behave as sort of @xmath113-clipping  criteria , but with different clipping factors . in this regard , it must be noted that if we apply the original criterion proposed by @xcite , i.e. @xmath114 , more than half the field stars dlcs ( 52.4 per cent ) are classified as variable . on the other hand , if no weighting ( @xmath25 factor ) is applied , 20.7 per cent and 33.4 per cent of the stars are classified as variable with the @xmath0 criterion and @xmath1 test , respectively .",
    "clearly , results from unweighted tests would be catastrophic , and we will no longer discuss them .    as a further comparison between different tests , we calculated the percentage of dlcs in each star field that resulted to be variable using the @xmath0 criterion and @xmath1 test , considering three different cls : 95 per cent , 99 per cent , and 99.5 per cent .",
    "we found that the distributions ( for both statistics and the three cls ) have a clear peak around 10 per cent , although , at the same cl , the histograms corresponding to the @xmath1 test extend to larger variability percentages . it is interesting to note that the distributions of @xmath115 and @xmath116 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : starscf ] , are practically identical ( a ks test gives a value of 1-prob@xmath117 ) .",
    "we interpret that , for our data , we have to relax the cl of the @xmath0 criterion to 95 per cent in order to obtain similar results as with the @xmath1 test at the 99.5 per cent cl .     at 95 per cent@xmath6cl and @xmath1 at 99.5 per cent@xmath6cl.,scaledwidth=48.0% ]    it is now clear that the @xmath1 test is not working as expected ( and neither does the @xmath6statistically ill founded@xmath6 @xmath0 criterion ) .",
    "however , this should not be surprising , since it is well@xmath6known that the @xmath1 test is particularly sensible to non - gaussian errors ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and photometric time series , unless taken by an absolutely perfect space telescope equipped with an absolutely perfect detector , will be affected by systematic error sources , adding a red - noise  ( i.e. time@xmath6correlated at low frequencies ) component .",
    "these sources of non - gaussian distributed errors include flat - field imperfections , airmass variations , imperfect tracking , changing atmospheric conditions ( seeing , transparency , scintillation ) , changing moonlight and airglow illumination , unnoticed cosmic rays , etc .",
    "moreover , photometric errors usually correlate with those systematic effects , as e.g. when the s / n ratio drops due to changes in seeing or atmospheric transparency .",
    "any statistical test used to detect microvariability in agn dlcs obtained with ground - based telescopes should thus be founded on solid theoretical bases and , at the same time , be able to deal both with random ( i.e. , photometric ) and systematic ( non - gaussian ) errors . in a forthcoming paper , we will further explore the performance of currently used tests by means of simulated observations .",
    "this will allow us to test variability tests under controlled situations , aiming at the selection of a test that is appropriate to deal with real observational issues .",
    "there are several works that have been dedicated to the study of statistical tools to detect microvariability in agn .",
    "@xcite studied the @xmath118 test , the @xmath1 test for variances , the anova test , and the @xmath0 criterion for a set of simulated light curves , concluding that the most robust methodologies are the anova and @xmath118 tests , while the @xmath1 statistic is less powerful but still a reliable tool , and , finally , the @xmath0 criterion should be avoided because it is not a proper statistical test .",
    "further analysis about these tests is presented in @xcite , where a study of the _ bartels and runs _ non - parametric test was added . in that work",
    ", the author proposed that the best choices to detect microvariability in agn light curves are the use of an anova or an enhanced@xmath119 test ( in the latter , several comparison stars are used to define a combined variance , instead of using a single star ) .",
    "a continuation of this work was published by @xcite , where the enhanced-@xmath1 and the _ nested _ anova tests were studied , concluding that these are the most powerful tests to detect photometric variations in dlcs , due to the increase in the power of the statistics , product of adding more comparison stars to the statistical analysis ( the _ nested _ anova test also requires some extra field stars , but fewer than in the enhanced-@xmath1 test ) .",
    "it should be noted that , in these papers , the authors explicitly state that only photon shot@xmath6noise was considered for the light@xmath6curve simulations , while any systematic effect was entirely disregarded .",
    "so , despite their theoretical advantages , some of these tests may be impractical for dealing with real observations ; moreover , if error distributions do not fulfil the assumptions on which those tests are based , their use should be discouraged or , at the very least , be taken with extreme care . in our case",
    ", we are working with dlcs with a rather small number of observations ; this is a common situation , since agn microvariability light curves are mostly limited to under @xmath120 points ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the need of a large number of points in light curves strongly limits the use of the @xmath3 test .",
    "the same applies to the anova test : despite its claimed power to detect microvariability @xcite , this test is seldom used , because it requires a large number of data points too @xcite ; moreover , data grouping might be impractical for faint objects requiring relatively long integration times , and could lead to false results if data within a time span larger than the ( unknown ) variability time - scale are grouped .",
    "in fact , some doubtful results from the use of the anova test in agn microvariability studies @xcite have already been discussed in . regarding the _",
    "nested _ anova and the enhanced@xmath119 tests , both tools require several comparison stars to perform optimally @xcite , while having appropriately populated star fields around agns is more the exception than the rule .",
    "@xcite , in turn , discuss the application of different tests to agn light curves from space - based observations .",
    "they compare the @xmath0 criterion and the @xmath3 and @xmath1 tests using a sample of randomly generated light curves , concluding that the three tools show equal powers .",
    "however , when error measurements are themselves erroneous , @xmath3 has the highest power followed by @xmath0 and then @xmath1 .",
    "on the other hand , the use of tests specifically devised to deal with gaussian errors may not be optimal to work with ground - based light curves , where atmospheric and instrumental effects produce correlated errors , with non - gaussian distributions .",
    "in fact , even under pure random noise , errors in magnitude space will have asymmetric non - gaussian distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the @xmath3 test , which requires that individual data points have accurately determined errors , with gaussian distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; neither of these is always fulfilled by optical ground - based photometry . the @xmath1 test , in turn ,",
    "does not behave as expected if error distributions are non - gaussian ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "it is thus important to emphasize that @xmath6besides limitations typical of ground - based observations@xmath6 variability studies of agns usually have particular issues , like poorly sampled dlcs ( due to low brightness of the source ) , and the availability of rather few field stars for differential photometry ; these facts must be taken into account for the correct choice of the statistical analysis of the dlcs .",
    "in order to test the most widely used tests for agn variability , we studied the @xmath0 and @xmath1 statistics with a large and homogeneous sample of real observational data .",
    "we worked with a sample of 39 southern agns observed with the 2.15 m jorge sahade  telescope ( casleo ) , san juan , argentina , obtaining 78 nightly differential photometry light curves , to which we applied the @xmath0 and @xmath1 statistics .    besides which statistic is the better choice to analyse the behaviour of the dlcs",
    ", we want to point out that it is very important to use the weighted tests for the case of agn differential photometry , because of the particular issues mentioned in the previous paragraph ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* for a full discussion on this issue ) .",
    "we used the @xmath25 scale introduced by @xcite .",
    "there are cases in which the variability results change just because of not using this weight .",
    "those cases are the ones in which @xmath25 is far from @xmath73 ( i.e. , the magnitudes of the comparison and/or control stars are not similar to the target s magnitude ) .    from the results of applying the @xmath0 criterion and @xmath1 test to the sample , we found that , with respect to the dlc amplitude ( @xmath53 ) , @xmath1 results tend to classify as variable those dlcs with @xmath53 near the rms error , while for dlcs with high amplitude , both statistics tend to detect variability . for the elapsed time ( @xmath121 ) , dlcs with high values of @xmath54",
    "are classified as variable , in agreement to the fact that this high value usually appears in light curves where systematic variability is observed . both statistics seem to be robust in the detection ( or non - detection ) of variability when dlcs present low instrumental dispersion ( 0.012mag ) , but if the dispersion of the control@xmath6comparison  light curve reaches values larger than 0.02mag ( some cases for the nvar / nvar histogram , fig.[fig : hs2]c ) , low - amplitude agn variability could be masked due to the low s / n ratio in the dlc .    taking a deeper look into the @xmath0 criterion , and comparing it with the @xmath1 test",
    ", we arrived at the conclusion that , even though the @xmath0 criterion can not be considered as an actual statistical test , it could still be a useful parameter to detect variability , provided that the correct significance factor is chosen . in this way , we found that applying @xmath0 we may obtain rather more reliable variability results , especially for small amplitude and/or noisy dlcs .",
    "finally , a study of the behaviour of the field stars was made in order to analyse the stability of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , excluding the agn . from these new set of dlcs , we calculated the parameters involved in the statistics and the percentage of field stars that result variable for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "we found that , for the three cls considered ( 95 per cent , 99 per cent and 99.5 per cent ) , both statistics show a peak around 10 per cent in their distributions , and comparing within the same cl , the @xmath1 test presents an extended distribution to larger variability percentages .",
    "we thus notice that the @xmath1 test tends to classify as variable a larger number of dlcs than the @xmath0 parameter , well above the expected number of variable stars in our fields .",
    "these variability results are clearly false positive results , possibly due to the inability of the @xmath1 test to deal with non - gaussian distributed errors .",
    "there has to be always a balance between the power of a given test ( i.e. its ability to detect real variability ) and its rate of false positives .",
    "ultimately , the outcome of this balance should be dictated by astrophysical considerations , but this requires precise knowledge of each test s behaviour under particular observational conditions .",
    "this study is being completed carrying out a series of simulated observations , which involve differential photometry for several agns and comparison stars , immersed in a variety of distinct atmospheric conditions and several different observational situations .",

    "but , if the mother population of both sets of samples is the same , or both sets come from populations with the same dispersion ( i.e. @xmath142 ) , then we have that the probability density distribution of the ratio @xmath4 is      which is independent of the true dispersion .",
    "this turns out to be the important point : this distribution is then ready to be used in a statistical test . in particular , since it is the result of assuming @xmath144 , the @xmath4 test null hypothesis is that both @xmath145 and @xmath146 are statistically equivalent .",
    "we see that they are the same distribution , only expressed with different variables , i.e. @xmath148 with @xmath149 .",
    "thus , using the @xmath4 test of dispersions gives exactly the same results as using the @xmath1 test of variances ."

    "<S> the motivation for this is that the implementation of these methods leads to different and contradictory results , making the variability classification of the light curves of a certain source dependent on the statistics implemented .    for this purpose </S>",
    "<S> , we re - analyse the results on an agn sample observed along several sessions with the 2.15 m jorge sahade  telescope ( casleo ) , san juan , argentina . </S>",
    "<S> for each agn we constructed the nightly differential light curves . </S>",
    "<S> we thus obtained a total of 78 light curves for 39 agns , and we then applied the statistical tests mentioned above , in order to re - classify the variability state of these light curves and in an attempt to find the suitable statistical methodology to study photometric ( micro)variations . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that , although the @xmath0 criterion is not proper a statistical test , it could still be a suitable parameter to detect variability and that its application allows us to get more reliable variability results , in contrast with the @xmath1 test .    </S>",
