    "wakes , consisting of expanding @xmath0 shaped wave structures , are a common occurrence behind objects moving in a fluid such as a boat on a lake surface . in this case",
    "they consist of linear surface water waves that are excited by the perturbation caused by the moving boat and they move away in the direction perpendicular to the motion of the boat at their characteristic phase velocity .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs when an airplane moves through the atmosphere creating a three dimensional structure of wake fields behind it .",
    "the two dimensional projection of such a trailing structure again has a characteristic @xmath0 shape .",
    "when the speed of the moving object exceeds the sound speed of the medium the outer boundary of the cone shaped structure is defined by a propagating shock wave excited by the moving object and the structure is then termed as a mach cone .",
    "wake fields and mach cones have been widely studied in fluid and gas dynamics @xcite as well as in plasmas @xcite for their intrinsic properties as well as their practical applications . in plasmas ,",
    "laser pulse induced wake - fields have generated a great deal of interest due to their potential as a high energy particle accelerator @xcite .",
    "more recently mach cones excited by a supersonically moving charged particle in a dusty plasma medium have received some attention @xcite . a dusty ( or complex ) plasma @xcite consists of micron sized dust grains that are embedded in an electron - ion plasma .",
    "the massive dust particles ( that can range in size from a few nanometers to micrometers ) get negatively charged by acquiring more electrons than ions from the background and their dynamics leads to new low frequency collective modes in the medium .",
    "since dust particles are of a macroscopic size they are visible to the eye and their dynamics can be easily tracked using visual techniques .",
    "this characteristic feature of a dusty plasma has motivated and facilitated a large amount of theoretical and laboratory experimental work on linear and nonlinear wave propagation studies including the study of wakes and mach cones @xcite .",
    "as is well known , in a mach cone the angle formed by the two shock fronts ( @xmath1 ) is related to the mach number @xmath2 by the relation @xmath3 .",
    "measurement of the cone angle thus provides a convenient means of assessing the speed of the travelling particle and the utility of this simple diagnostic tool in the context of dusty plasmas has been pointed out by havnes et al @xcite .",
    "an interesting extrapolation from laboratory observations of mach cones in dusty plasmas has been made by brattli _",
    "et al _ @xcite who have predicted the existence of mach cone structures in saturn s ring region due to fast moving large sized charged boulders moving midst a dusty plasma composed of finer sized particles and an electron - ion plasma .",
    "detection of such a mach cone pattern from space platforms like satellites can provide valuable information about the speed and location of the revolving boulders .",
    "however , in reality it is likely that the mach cone generated by a given boulder would interact and interfere with similar cones generated by neighbouring boulders resulting in a more complex wave pattern .",
    "one commonly sees emergence of such patterns in water waves when two boats travel close to each other or pass each other from opposite directions .",
    "the emergent interference patterns have characteristic spatio - temporal properties including pockets of intense wave amplitudes .",
    "it is of interest therefore to investigate the nature of such dynamical patterns in a dusty plasma when two mach cones are simultaneously generated by charged objects travelling in the same or opposite directions to each other .",
    "we have carried out such an investigation in this paper by a theoretical analysis of a model system consisting of a dusty plasma fluid in which two charged sources travel at supersonic speeds ( with reference to the dust acoustic speed ) over a range of separation distances and differing directions .",

    "in particular the inter - fringe distance of the pattern is seen to increase monotonically with the relative velocity whereas the inclination of the fringe is found to decrease with the relative velocity .",
    "measurement of such signatures in patterns between interacting charged projectiles can serve as a useful diagnostic tool for estimating the relative velocity of the projectiles .",
    "a potential application of such a tool could be in astrophysical scenarios like planetary rings where interactions between mach cones excited by fast moving large sized charged objects moving in an environment of finer charged dust particles and electron ion plasma are likely to occur .",
    "an experimental verification of our results would be useful in developing such a tool .",
    "it can be easily carried out in present day laboratory set - ups by re - doing some of the past mach cone experiments in dusty plasmas @xcite in the presence of two counter / co travelling fast particles .",
    "such a verification can provide an appropriate benchmark for a diagnostic tool that can then be applied to other situations .",
    "the experiment could also serve to delineate deviations if any arising from possible nonlinear features of mach cones - a physics that has not been included in our present analysis and that remains an open problem for future investigations .",

    "<S> we theoretically investigate the interaction and propagation characteristics of two co / counter propagating mach cones triggered by two projectile particles moving with supersonic velocities in the same / opposite directions through a dusty plasma medium . </S>",
    "<S> the mach cone solutions are obtained by solving a model set of fluid equations for a heavily charged dust fluid that includes the contributions of the projectile particles in the poisson equation . </S>",
    "<S> the density profiles and velocity vector maps of the mach wings show interesting structural changes when they interact with each other and form patterns similar to interference fringes . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the co - propagating mach cones , the wings of counter propagating mach cones produce a larger number of maxima and minima in the pattern resulting from their mutual interaction . </S>",
    "<S> in addition the time duration of the formation of two maxima or minima at a particular point decreases due to the interactions of mach cones . </S>",
    "<S> another notable feature is that the spacing between adjacent maxima increases while the fringe angle decreases with the increase of relative velocity of the counter propagating projectile particles . </S>"
