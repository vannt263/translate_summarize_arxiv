    "there has been a longstanding interest in the effects of confining polymer chains in tubes and slits , for instance , in relation to the field of size exclusion chromatography @xcite .",
    "recent advances in chip lithography have led to the fabrication of well - defined nanochannels @xcite so that issues in polymer physics may now be addressed which were elusive in the past @xcite . at the same time",
    ", stiff polymers like dna and actin can now be well - aligned which is of considerable interest in the biosciences @xcite .    in order to understand the mechanism of chain elongation",
    ", it is crucial to investigate the alignment as a function of the size of the channel cross section and this has been carried out recently by reisner et al @xcite .",
    "the channel width was of the order of the dna persistence length .",
    "they focused especially on the relaxation times of monodisperse double - stranded dna fluctuating in square and rectangular nanochannels which they compared with estimates inferred from theory @xcite .",
    "the pictures of fluorescently labeled dna they show are , however , quite remarkable with respect to their extreme degree of elongation , which has not been remarked upon before .",
    "let us consider , in fact , a naive estimate of the distance @xmath2 between two consecutive hairpins of the nanoconfined dna which would be something like@xmath3the radius of a hairpin , which is supposed to be semicircular , is @xmath4 and its bending energy is @xmath5 .",
    "the temperature is @xmath6  and @xmath7  is boltzmann s constant .",
    "a form similar to eq ( [ vgl1 ] )  arises in the theory of nematically confined stiff chains kho , gen , war , gla , vro , odi2,spa and will be rederived below .",
    "note that the b - helix is assumed to remain intact .",
    "thus , in the reisner experiment , in the case of dna confined within a @xmath8 nm channel for instance , one would expect the hairpin to extend to its maximum diameter of 100 nm ( equal to the diagonal ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath9 @xmath0 m from eq ( [ vgl1 ] ) .",
    "this is the mere step length of the effectively one - dimensional random walk , yet the t2 dna having a contour length of @xmath10 @xmath0 m is almost fully elongated @xcite !",
    "i argue here that there is an important effect missing in eq ( [ vgl1 ] ) , namely entropic depletion of the dna hairpin by the wall of the nanochannel .",
    "as the hairpin approaches the wall , it loses orientational and translational degrees of freedom .",
    "the resulting entropic repulsion forces the hairpin toward the axis of the channel so the hairpin is tightened up .",
    "eq ( [ vgl1 ] ) seriously underestimates the elongation for this reason",
    ". my emphasis will be on an analysis of this phenomenon in the elastic or classical limit ; an analytical solution of the relevant fokker planck equation for a stiff chain trapped in a pore is well - known to be difficult although numerical analyses have been performed @xcite .",
    "the hairpin is thus assumed to be a two - dimensional curve within a plane aligned along the long axis of the nanochannel .",
    "the hairpin chord , which is the vector distance between the two ends , is perpendicular to this axis but the shape of the curve is not semicircular and needs to be determined .",
    "the chord of length @xmath11 has to be fitted into the cross section of the channel .",
    "this is a geometrical problem in two dimensions .",
    "clearly , the confinement of the chord entails a loss in both orientational and translational degrees of freedom , giving rise to a free energy @xmath12of entropic origin .",
    "this decreases as the hairpin tightens up so it balances the bending energy @xmath13 at an optimum radius @xmath14 .",
    "accordingly , the free energy of the hairpin in the classical limit is@xmath15where a bar denotes the state of minimum free energy .    my main objective will be to compute this quantity .",
    "it is convenient to express the scale @xmath2 as@xmath16    @xmath17    here , @xmath18 is a constant and @xmath19 is a sum of a variety of fluctuational free energies beyond the classical limit which i will analyze qualitatively .    the paper is organized as follows . in the next section ,",
    "i compute the optimum shape of the hairpin and the minimum bending energy . in section 3 ,",
    "the free energy of confinement is evaluated for three types of cross section : circular , square and rectangular .",
    "the distance  between hairpins or the global persistence length is calculated in section 4 . in the last section",
    ", a discussion will be given of the resulting free energies , hairpin sizes and dna elongations in comparison with experiment .",
    "therein , the terms neglected in the classical limit will also be remarked upon .",
    "the hairpin has a length @xmath20 which is to be determined while its end - to - end distance is constrained to be @xmath11 .",
    "it is described by the tangential unit vector @xmath21 at contour position @xmath22 ( see fig 1 ) .",
    "the hairpin curve is assumed to be symmetric about the @xmath23 axis which is parallel to the central axis of the nanochannel .",
    "the angle between @xmath24 and the x axis is @xmath25 so that the unit vector may be written in terms of the coordinate unit vectors @xmath26 .",
    "the boundary conditions are assumed to be @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "i first compute the shape of the curve by minimizing the bending energy of the hairpin of length @xmath20 @xmath29subject to the constraint@xmath30 in eq ( [ vgl5 ] ) , @xmath31 is the persistence length , @xmath6 is the temperature , @xmath32 is boltzmann s constant and @xmath33 equals the inverse radius of curvature . minimizing eq ( [ vgl5 ] ) with respect to @xmath34 leads to@xmath35where the lagrange multiplier @xmath36 may be positive , zero or negative .",
    "yamakawa and stockmayer @xcite have previously analyzed this equation in their theory of the excluded - volume effect of stiff chains but our treatment differs from theirs because the constraint is nonzero here ( eq ( [ vgl6 ] ) ) .",
    "integration of eq ( [ vgl7 ] ) yields@xmath37where the constant @xmath38 must be positive .",
    "in the remainder of the analysis we need not compute @xmath39 explicitly . the bending energy is as yet given in terms of three parameters@xmath40we ultimately wish to minimize this with respect to @xmath20 subject to eq ( vgl6 ) .",
    "but it turns out that it is possible to do this analytically  via the dummy variable @xmath41 defined below .",
    "actually , there is another restriction on eq ( [ vgl8 ] ) : the chain can not cross the wall of the channel .",
    "this is difficult to take into account mathematically because it is a local constraint defined at every point of the contour @xmath22 . nevertheless , on physical grounds ,",
    "one expects deviations of reverse curvature away from a typical hairpin configuration to be forbidden in view of the increase in elastic energy associated with such bending .",
    "accordingly , i assume the simpler constraint @xmath42 holds .    the right hand side of eq ( [ vgl8 ] )",
    "is now rewritten in terms of the new angular variable @xmath43 with boundary values @xmath44 and @xmath45.@xmath46the constant @xmath47 is defined by@xmath48note that @xmath41 may be positive or negative though the combination @xmath49 can not be negative .",
    "next , the objective is to the express the bending energy given by eq ( [ vgl9 ] ) solely in terms of @xmath41 .",
    "first , i integrate eq ( vgl10 ) over the entire contour from @xmath50 to @xmath51 .",
    "this leads to@xmath52 in terms of the elliptic integral@xmath53the constraint eq ( [ vgl6 ] ) is rewritten as@xmath54the derivative is now substituted from eq ( [ vgl10 ] ) and @xmath55 is expressed in terms of @xmath56 .",
    "the scaled contour length @xmath57 thus becomes a function explicitly dependent on @xmath41 only.@xmath58where @xmath59 is another elliptic integral @xmath60the constants @xmath38 and @xmath36 can also be written in terms of @xmath41 with the help of eqs ( [ vgl11 ] ) and ( [ vgl12]).@xmath61@xmath62we now need to derive an expression for the bending energy which may be differentiated with respect to @xmath41 as expediently as is possible . eqs ( vgl17 ) and ( [ vgl18 ] ) are first substituted into eq ( [ vgl9 ] ) and then @xmath41 is eliminated with the help of eq ( [ vgl15]).@xmath63this is still too complicated because it contains @xmath18 .",
    "hence , i eliminate @xmath18 by inserting eq ( [ vgl10 ] ) into eq ( [ vgl14 ] ) and using eq ( [ vgl12 ] ) .",
    "eq ( [ vgl19 ] ) then reduces to the form@xmath64 in terms of the integral@xmath65and the function@xmath66the advantage of writing the energy as the product @xmath67 is that the numerator and denominator are identical in the respective integrands so that one may expect cancellation of terms after differentiation ( apart from the factor @xmath2 which , not inconveniently , increases monotonically with @xmath56 ) . in fact , the derivative of eq ( [ vgl20 ] ) with respect to @xmath41 introduces @xmath68 into the integrands which is then conveniently rewritten in terms of @xmath69 .",
    "terms of the kind @xmath67 then cancel and we obtain@xmath70 \\label{vgl23}\\]]this form is reexpressed as a two - dimensional integral with the help of eqs ( [ vgl13 ] ) , ( [ vgl16 ] ) and ( [ vgl21 ] ) .",
    "after rearrangement , this yields@xmath71next , one notes that the function @xmath72 increases monotonically with @xmath73 for all @xmath41 , whatever the sign .",
    "the remaining factor in the integrand is antisymmetric in @xmath73 and @xmath56 .",
    "hence , the derivative must be positive for all @xmath41 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the bending energy is a minimum as @xmath74 .",
    "asymptotically , we have from eqs ( [ vgl13 ] ) and ( [ vgl16])@xmath75with@xmath76@xmath77with@xmath78eq ( [ vgl15 ] ) yields for the optimum length of the hairpin@xmath79the minimum elastic energy of the hairpin according to eq ( [ vgl19 ] ) is@xmath80    i have integrated eqs ( [ vgl15 ] ) and ( [ vgl19 ] ) numerically in order to assess the nature of the elastic `` well '' ( see table i ) .",
    "the optimum curve is very close to that of a semicircle @xmath81the bending energy only starts to increase markedly as @xmath41 approaches unity .",
    "the hairpin is almost a straight line in that case , with highly rounded ends .",
    "in the introduction it was argued that it is plausible to introduce a classical limit for the state of the hairpin which is aligned along the centerline of the nanochannel .",
    "then , we need to address two two - dimensional problems , the shape of the hairpin treated above and how the chord of the hairpin can be fitted into the cross section of the channel . in the latter case , we may speak of an entropy of depletion since orientational and translational degrees of the chain are cut off as the hairpin is formed and restricted by the channel walls . in this section",
    "i give approximate expressions for the depletion entropy for three characteristic types of nanochannels : circular , square and retangular .",
    "the chord of the hairpin is a segment of length @xmath11 enclosed within a circle of radius @xmath82 ( see fig 2 ) .",
    "the translational degrees of freedom of the segment are assessed by how we may position point @xmath31 in the circle which is at a distance @xmath83 from the origin @xmath84 .",
    "the orientational degrees of freedom are expressed by the angle @xmath85 . in this subsection",
    ", all lengths will be scaled by @xmath82 for convenience .",
    "note that we require @xmath86 otherwise the segment does not fit into the circle .",
    "in addition , if @xmath87 , the segment can not rotate freely and the maximum angle @xmath88 is given by@xmath89it is in this regime that an approximation to the entropy is derived .",
    "the fraction of realizable states is written as@xmath90this is simply a sum over all degrees of freedom noting that @xmath91 .",
    "it is normalized by a factor @xmath92 applicable to the state if the segment were to orient and translate freely within the circle .",
    "the bending forces of the previous section tend to open up the hairpin toward the channel wall .",
    "therefore , let us assume @xmath4 and @xmath83 are close to unity and introduce the small quantities @xmath93 and @xmath94 : @xmath95 and @xmath96 @xmath97 . in that case , the angle @xmath88 is also small and we may write @xmath98 . from eq ( 29 )",
    "we have to the leading order@xmath99performing the integrations in eq ( 30 ) , we get the entropy of depletion@xmath100although this expression is formally valid in the limit @xmath101 , it turns out to be a very good approximation for all @xmath4 , even when the segment is virtually free to rotate . as @xmath102 ,",
    "@xmath103 is close to unity which is the exact value .",
    "furthermore , @xmath104 divided by the integral computed numerically is a monotone increasing function of @xmath93 . the leading approximation to the integrand @xmath105 in eq  ( [ vgl30 ] ) ,",
    "namely @xmath106 with @xmath88 given by eq ( [ vgl31 ] ) , is also very near the numerical value of @xmath105 for all @xmath107 .",
    "trying to fit a line segment into a square is different from the case discussed above .",
    "if the side of the square has a length @xmath108 and the length of the segment is restricted to the regime @xmath109 , then the segment can not rotate through 360 degrees ( see fig 3 ) .",
    "one of its ends ( denoted by point @xmath31 ) is constrained to lie inside the region that is almost like a triangle in fig 3 .",
    "its boundary in terms of the cartesian coordinates @xmath110 and @xmath111 is given by@xmath112again , i attempt to approximate the entropy of depletion by a suitable limiting form in this case , when the segment is almost as long as the diagonal of the square . for convenience ,",
    "all lengths are scaled by @xmath108 in the rest of this subsection .",
    "thus the small quantities @xmath113 , @xmath114 and @xmath115 are introduced : @xmath116 , @xmath117 and @xmath118 in terms of the coordinates @xmath119 and @xmath23 of point @xmath31 . to the leading order",
    ", we then have from eq ( 33 ) the requirement@xmath120the orientational degree of freedom is expressed by the angle @xmath85 which is bounded by the angles @xmath121 and @xmath122 ( see fig 3 ) .",
    "they are given by@xmath123@xmath124    since the segment approaches a diagonal in size , it is convenient to introduce the small angles @xmath125and @xmath126 defined by @xmath127 and @xmath128 respectively .",
    "the left and right hand sides of eqs ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) are now expanded in all of the small variables which yields @xmath129 and @xmath130 to the leading order .",
    "hence , the range of the orientational degree of freedom is@xmath131accordingly , the fraction of realizable states is , again , a sum over all degrees of freedom@xmath132and the entropy of depletion is expressed as@xmath133the number of corners is four which has to be included in the normalization ( because of fluctuations , the chord of the hairpin can , of course , sample the entire square cross section of the nanochannel ) .",
    "it would appear that eq ( [ vgl38 ] ) is a very good approximation to the exact @xmath134 because eq ( [ vgl38 ] ) equals 0.8488 at @xmath135 which is quite close to unity .",
    "however , the numerically computed @xmath134 is more than twice that predicted by eq ( [ vgl38 ] ) at @xmath136 so the approximation must be viewed as fairly accurate at best for all @xmath137 .",
    "a simple approximation for the entropy of depletion can be given in the case of a nanoslit of large aspect ratio i.e. when the cross section is a rectangle of width @xmath108 very much larger than height @xmath138 ( see fig 4a ) .",
    "we suppose @xmath138 is so small that we may write @xmath139 for the maximum angle @xmath88 when the hairpin chord just touches one of the walls ( see fig 4b ) .",
    "ultimately , this implies that the hairpin must be sufficiently stiff ( @xmath140 , say ) .",
    "if the chord or line segment is at a distance @xmath119 from the wall , the contribution to the orientational entropy is proportional to @xmath141 owing to the angular restriction ( @xmath88 would be @xmath142 if the segment were to orient freely ) .",
    "hence , the total orientational entropy is given by@xmath143the segment may also translate along the longitudinal axis of length @xmath108 implying a fraction of realizable states equal to about @xmath144 .",
    "the total entropy of depletion thus becomes@xmath145",
    "-1   \\label{vgl41}\\]]this is only valid at small enough @xmath138 . for this reason",
    "a smooth crossover from eq ( [ vgl41 ] ) to eq ( [ vgl39 ] ) does not exist as @xmath146 and @xmath147 .",
    "the distance between hairpins for a chain in a uniaxially ordered matrix scales as the global persistence length which is given in terms of a fluctuation theorem involving the chain susceptibility @xcite .",
    "this is a rigorous way of deriving @xmath2 but is only useful if one has a precise analytical theory for the segmental distribution inside the nanochannel , which is lacking at present .",
    "i have yet to establish eqs ( vgl1 ) and ( [ vgl2 ] ) and in the classical limit the following physical argument is well known @xcite .",
    "the hairpins of length @xmath148 may be viewed as defects in a one - dimensional chain model of contour length @xmath149 .",
    "there are @xmath150 defects of energy @xmath151 and concentration @xmath152 .",
    "therefore , the free energy of the chain becomes@xmath153where the first two terms derive from the ideal entropy of the defect gas .",
    "minimization of the free energy with respect to @xmath2 leads to@xmath154the free energy of confinement or depletion @xmath155 has been discussed in the previous section .",
    "if  we set @xmath156 , @xmath157 and we assume the bend is  semicircular , we regain eq ( [ vgl1 ] ) . any approximations incurred in the previous analyses can be accounted for by adding an energy @xmath158 to @xmath159 .",
    "the global persistence length will now be evaluated for the various nanochannels .",
    "the bending energy of a hairpin is given by eqs ( [ vgl19 ] ) and ( vgl28 ) , and eq ( [ vgl32 ] ) expresses the free energy of depletion for the hairpin enclosed in the circular nanochannel . upon minimization , the total free energy of the hairpin in the classical limit@xmath160leads to an optimum radius@xmath161   \\label{vgl45}\\]]using eqs ( [ vgl43])-([vgl45 ] ) ,",
    "i have tabulated @xmath14 and @xmath2 for dna with a typical persistence length of @xmath162 nm ( see table ii ) .",
    "these results will be discussed in the next section .",
    "the entropy of depletion is now given by eq ( [ vgl39 ] ) so that the free energy of a hairpin in a square nanochannel is@xmath163minimization of @xmath164 with respect to @xmath4 gives@xmath165   \\label{vgl47}\\]]the optimum radius and distance between hairpins are displayed in table iii for dna which has a persistence length of 57.5 nm .",
    "these predictions will be compared with the experiments of reisner et al .",
    "eq ( [ vgl41 ] ) leads to the free energy of a hairpin in a nanoslit@xmath166 + 1   \\label{vgl 48}\\]]minimization yields an optimum radius@xmath167note that this expression does not depend on @xmath138 . in this case , it is possible to present a convenient formula for the distance between hairpins@xmath168 in a recent experiment @xcite , the dimensions of the nanoslit were kept fixed but the persistence length was varied by changing the ionic strength . in table iv , @xmath2 is presented as a function of @xmath31 for a @xmath169 nm nanoslit .",
    "the first striking conclusion is that the distance between hairpins is considerably larger than the usual persistence length of dna .",
    "this is true even when @xmath31 is smaller than the typical width of the channel , irrespective of the type ( see tables ii , iii and iv ) . in the larger channels , the effect of entropic depletion",
    "is clearly seen for the hairpins are tightened up significantly ( compare @xmath4 with @xmath82 or @xmath108 ) . at the other extreme",
    ", the global persistence length may reach the scale of a mm which means it may prove feasible to align bacterial chromosomes in nanochannels completely .",
    "entropic depletion is an important factor in the elongation .",
    "the large values of @xmath2 are intimately related to the small size of the orientational fluctuations of the aligned ( nonhairpinlike ) sections of the chain with respect to the channel axis .",
    "this relation has been discussed at length for a wormlike chain in a nematic @xcite . here",
    ", the mathematics of a chain in a channel involves both translational and orientational degrees of freedom so is significantly more complicated .",
    "nevertheless , the scaling estimate @xcite for the angular fluctuations , when amended by a small numerical coefficient ( see eq ( [ vgl53 ] ) below ) , qualitatively corroborates the large values of @xmath2 proposed here .",
    "a further implication is that the crossover to the scaling regime applicable in the limit of flexible chains @xcite is not trivial .",
    "the transition is delayed because @xmath2 is still very large at @xmath170 channel width .",
    "the crossover must occur at @xmath171 but , as i argue below , the classical limit is no longer valid then .",
    "it is interesting to note that the depletion effect is much stronger when the nanochannel is square than when it is circular ( compare the coefficients 1.5 and 3 in eqs ( [ vgl44 ] ) and ( [ vgl46 ] ) ) . as a hairpin retracts from the edge of a square channel , its freedom to move increases rapidly",
    "this is much less so in the case the channel is circular for the curvature is directed smoothly inward then .",
    "the entropic depletion by a nanoslit given by eq ( [ vgl41 ] ) is quite peculiar .",
    "it leads to an expression for the optimum radius ( eq ( [ vgl49 ] ) ) which is independent of @xmath138 .",
    "moreover , for highly elongated slits , the radius never increases beyond the persistence length .",
    "it would be interesting to see how robust this classical computation is to fluctuations .",
    "a priori one might expect a semiflexible chain confined in a very thin slit of infinite dimensions to behave essentially as a two - dimensional chain of persistence length @xmath172 , but this is not what is predicted here .",
    "the precise range of validity of eq ( [ vgl41 ] ) needs to be established .",
    "reisner et al have presented fluorescent images of dna in square ( or almost square ) nanochannels @xcite .",
    "the elongated length @xmath173 of the dna represents the typical average span of the chain and is shown in table v as a function of the nanochannel size in the case of @xmath174 dna .",
    "the span of a polymer chain is the smallest size of the box it can be enclosed in and in one dimension its average has been computed in the flexible limit ( @xmath175 ; see refs and ) @xmath176the average span is not known for the wormlike chain model but as @xmath2 tends to @xmath149 or becomes larger , the root - mean - square extension @xmath177 should be close to @xmath178.@xmath179besides the hairpins , orientational fluctuations also shorten the chain . if @xmath180 is the angle between its tangent and the axis of the channel , we have the following average@xmath181this is derived from burkhardt s expression @xcite  for the distribution of a harmonically confined worm , suitably ( though approximately ) rescaled to account for the hard wall repulsion in a square nanochannel ( see ref ) . in table v , the effective span ( @xmath182 or @xmath183 ) is compared with the experimental @xmath184 @xcite where the cosine is computed to second order via eq ( [ vgl53 ] ) .",
    "the agreement is quite good if one bears in mind that no adjustable parameters have been used .",
    "dna of comparable size is also highly elongated in nanoslits of dimensions presented in table iv .",
    "this essentially agrees with the large values of @xmath2 computed from eq ( [ vgl50 ] ) .",
    "we are currently investigating whether this expression is quantitatively accurate @xcite .",
    "i finally discuss a variety of fluctuational terms that have been neglected in the classical limit .",
    "\\1 ) eq ( [ vgl44 ] ) may be expanded to second order in order to evaluate fluctuations in the chord or size of a hairpin .",

    "furthermore , the hairpin is only slightly more eccentric than semicircular , at best , so the influence of tilting would appear to be negligible .",
    "\\4 ) the entropy of depletion has been computed only approximately when the cross section of the nanochannel is square . in the case of dna",
    ", this may suffice because any correction terms to eq ( [ vgl39 ] ) will be sensitive to the fluctuations in @xmath4 discussed above .",

    ", we conclude that the classical limit breaks down as @xmath4 approaches @xmath31 . for the widest channels in tables ii and iii ,",
    "the predictions for @xmath2 must be considered to be tentative only , for this reason .",
