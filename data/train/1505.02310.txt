    "<S> it has recently been observed that the sir distributions of a variety of cellular network models and transmission techniques look very similar in shape . as a result , they are well approximated by a simple horizontal shift ( or gain ) of the distribution of the most tractable model , the poisson point process ( ppp ) . to study and explain this behavior , this paper focuses on general single - tier network models with nearest - base station association and studies the asymptotic gain both at 0 and at infinity .    </S>",
    "<S> we show that the gain at 0 is determined by the so - called mean interference - to - signal ratio ( misr ) between the ppp and the network model under consideration , while the gain at infinity is determined by the expected fading - to - interference ratio ( efir ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the analysis of the misr is based on a novel type of point process , the so - called relative distance process , which is a one - dimensional point process on the unit interval [ 0,1 ] that fully determines the sir . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of the gains at 0 and infinity shows that the gain at 0 indeed provides an excellent approximation for the entire sir distribution . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the gain is mostly a function of the network geometry and barely depends on the path loss exponent and the fading . </S>",
    "<S> the results are illustrated using several examples of repulsive point processes .    </S>",
