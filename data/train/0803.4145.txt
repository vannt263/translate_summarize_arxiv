    "plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( pecvd ) from silane is a widespread technique employed to grow thin films of amorphous silicon . @xcite",
    "high growth rates are made possible by the deposition of reactive radicals produced in the plasma , as opposed to conventional cvd where the less reactive silane is directly adsorbed at the growing surface . by suitably controlling the energy of the ions while keeping a high density of reactants , a related technique , called low - energy plasma - enhanced chemical vapor deposition ( lepecvd ) , @xcite has introduced the possibility to obtain device - quality epitaxial films of crystalline silicon or silicon - germanium alloys , at temperatures much lower ( 600 @xmath5c ) than those necessary for conventional , thermal chemical vapor deposition ( 800 @xmath5c ) .",
    "@xmath3 is supposed to be the most abundant radical species in the plasma discharge in most of the experimental conditions@xcite .",
    "a description of the interactions of the silyl radical with the crystalline @xmath0 surface is then of great interest to model the epitaxial growth at conditions of both pecvd and lepecvd .",
    "the silyl radical can interact with the surface giving rise to different processes : it can remove a hydrogen from a saturated dimer via an eley - rideal mechanism , or it might adsorb on the surface , where it would further evolve by diffusing , decomposing with hydrogen release at the surface or by desorbing ( either as @xmath3 or @xmath4 ) .",
    "the fate of the silyl radical depends on the degree of surface hydrogenation at the landing site . at low hydrogen coverage",
    "the silyl can adsorb on a silicon dangling bond and decompose easily ( into sih@xmath6 for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the sticking probability is supposed to decrease at higher hydrogen coverage .",
    "the decomposition of the adsorbed radical is also supposed to be strongly hindered by the lack of free silicon surface atoms to which h might be transferred .",
    "diffusion of the adsorbed silyl from hydrogen rich to hydrogen poor regions might be a conceivable route for sih@xmath7 decomposition and insertion into the growing film .",

    ". an equally fast diffusion of silyl radicals at the hydrogenated surface of amorphous silicon is also often invoked as the reason behind the high smoothness of the amorphous films grown by pecvd @xcite .",
    "although several processes involving the adsorbed silyl radical at the si(100 ) surface have already been investigated in literature , previous theoretical studies always considered _ a - priory _ guess of reaction pathways , a procedure which might overlook unexpected mechanisms for diffusion and reaction of the adsorbed species.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate further the diffusion of sih@xmath7 adsorbed on the h : si(100)-(2x1 ) surface by making use of the ab - initio metadynamics technique@xcite , a new simulation tool which allows for extensive search of diffusion pathways .",

    "figure  [ fig : casino ] ) .",
    "for simplicity we label as  chemisorbed  ( here and in table [ tab : modelkmc ] ) the bound states of sih@xmath7 with adsorption energy in the range 0.15 - 0.35 ev . ]",
    "the evolution of the adsorbed sih@xmath7 radical we have discussed so far can be summarized by the simplified scheme of figure  [ fig : simple ] .",
    "a high barrier has to be overcome to escape from the realm of trap states and reach some `` mobile '' local minima . from one of those states , with similar barriers , the system might fall back into the traps , diffuse to nearby strongly bound states or reach one of the physisorbed states .",
    "barriers for migration between different strongly bound states ( @xmath13 0.3 ev ) are similar to barriers for migration between strongly bound and physisorbed states . from the latter physisorbed states , with barriers below 0.1  ev",
    ", the silyl can go back to the strongly bound states , diffuse amongst the physisorbed states or desorb , with similar barriers , either as silyl or as silane .",
    "the accuracy of our calculations is not sufficient to identify which are the dominant processes at low temperature , since uncertainties of the order of 0.1 ev in the activation energies are expected due to approximations in the exchange and correlation functional .",
    "however , at typical growth temperatures of pecvd and lepecvd the different events are likely to have similar probability . to estimate the average diffusion length that a silyl radical can travel before desorption takes place , we have performed kinetic monte carlo simulations using the activation energies for the different processes summarized in table iii .",
    "the results are discussed in the next section .    as a final remark",
    ", we compare our results on diffusion mechanisms with previous ab - initio works appeared in literature .",
    "the migration @xmath14 between two adjacent dimers rows and the @xmath15 jump within an open dimer have been investigated in ref.@xcite within a framework very similar to ours which , however , produced activation energies as high as 0.9 and 0.6 ev for the two process , respectively , as opposed to our values of 0.3 and 0.22 ev .",
    "the discrepancy is due to a very different geometry of the transition state which in ref.@xcite corresponds ( both for @xmath14 and @xmath15 jumps ) to a silyl nearly flat , @xmath16-like followed by an `` umbrella flip '' of the hydrogen atoms of the silyl . in our case , by choosing the trajectory obtained from the metadynamics simulation as initial mep in the neb optimization , we have been able to find a lower transition state involving small deformation of the @xmath3 radical which undergoes a rotation around its @xmath17 axis during the jump still keeping a @xmath18-like conformation .",
    "indeed , within the neb method , it is possible that an unappropriate choice of the initial mep might lead to a reaction path with an activation energy higher than the lowest energy path to the products .",
    "actually , we remark that an even lower barrier ( 0.17 vs 0.30 ev ) for the jump across the channel between two neighboring rows @xmath19 can be obtained along the path @xmath20 , with the physisorbed state ( i ) as an intermediate .",
    "another issue worth being mentioned is a discrepancy we have found with previous work @xcite on the diffusion mechanism of the silyl along the dimer row . using lsd - pbe ( spin unrestricted calculations )",
    "we have not been able to optimize the intermediate state described as a local minimum in figure  3 of ref.@xcite ( a silyl adsorbed on the five - fold coordinated si atom of the si - h group ) which has been obtained probably within a spin - restricted ( lda - pbe ) framework .",
    "in fact , the configuration proposed as a local minimum along the diffusion path in ref .",
    "@xcite , transforms in configuration ( e ) , in our neb optimization .",
    "moreover , by searching for a direct ( a)@xmath21(e ) transformation , we have always found configuration ( b ) as an intermediate minimum .",
    "consequently , we have not been able to find a minimum energy path for a `` direct '' jump @xmath22 along the dimer row as reported in ref .",
    "probably the discrepancies with previous work might still be ascribed to the neglect of spin polarization in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "based on the reaction scheme of figure  [ fig : casino ] we have performed kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations of diffusion and desorption of the adsorbed silyl .",
    "we have considered a lattice model , each lattice site corresponding to a @xmath23 unit cell . at each site different configurations for the silyl , corresponding to the different minima of table ii ( and fig .",
    "[ fig : casino ] ) are possible .",
    "we have only omitted configuration ( e ) , as it is only a shallow minimum along the @xmath24 migration pathway , causing frequent oscillation of the system between minima ( f ) and ( e ) which slows down dramatically simulations at low ( room ) temperatures .",
    "we have estimated reaction rates @xmath25 at different temperatures within transition state theory , i.e. @xmath26 , with activation energies @xmath27 given in table iii and prefactor @xmath28 set to 1  thz for all processes . in some cases , for example for the @xmath19 jump , two pathways equivalent by symmetry exists : we have used a 2  thz prefactor in this and similar cases .",
    "the choice of a common prefactor is obviously questionable .",
    "we have calculated within the harmonic approximation to transition state theory the prefactors for a diffusion process among strongly bound states ( ( a)@xmath21(b ) ) , for the diffusion between two physisorbed states ( ( i)@xmath21(@xmath29 ) ) and for desorption ( ( i)@xmath21@xmath30 ) .",
    "the prefactor @xmath28 is given by @xmath31 , where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the positive phonon frequencies for the initial and transition states respectively , obtained by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix , calculated in turns by finite displacements of the atoms .",
    "for the desorption process , which does not display a saddle point on the potential energy surface along the desorption path , we have instead used the vibrational frequency of the phonon whose displacement pattern is parallel to the minimum energy path .",
    "the results , @xmath34  thz ( ( a)@xmath21(b ) ) , @xmath35  thz ( ( i)@xmath21(@xmath29 ) ) and @xmath36  thz ( ( i)@xmath21@xmath30 ) , differ less than the typical errors in this kind of calculations , which are at least one or two orders of magnitude .",
    "therefore , given the considerable computational resources needed to compute all prefactors , we have judged not worthy to pursue this task at the moment .",
    "moreover , we have considered a single silyl adsorbed on a perfect h : si(100)-(2x1 ) surface which is obviously very far from the real growth conditions in pecvd where partial surface hydrogenation and large coverage of adsorbed species are expected .",
    "still , these simplified kmc simulations can provide crucial information on sih@xmath7 diffusion to model the behavior of the silyl radical at the more complex conditions of real pecvd growth . within our scheme ,",
    "the final fate of the adsorbed silyl is always desorption , either as a silyl or a silane .",
    "the kmc simulations let us estimate the average resident time of the silyl on the surface and the average maximum distance the silyl can travel before desorbing .",
    "we have checked the stability of the results versus random variations of the barriers within the typical dft uncertainties . to this aim",
    ", we have performed several sets of simulations adding a uniform noise with zero mean and @xmath37  ev width to all the minima and transition states energies in figure  [ fig : casino ] , discarding the set of randomized activation energies whenever one of them is negative .",
    "some other sets have also been discarded since they lead the system to oscillate for a long time ( @xmath38 steps ) between two minima separated by tiny barriers . in all simulations",
    "the silyl starts from site ( a ) since it corresponds to the adsorption site observed in dynamical car - parrinello simulations of sih@xmath7 impinging on the surface ( cf .",
    "section iiia ) .    the calculated distribution of resident times ( times before desorption ) is reported in fig .",
    "[ fig : escapetime ] , as obtained by averaging over @xmath39 kmc simulations . results with activation energies from table iii and with the energies randomized in every simulation are compared .",
    "the distribution of resident times , @xmath40 , is reported as a function of the logarithm of the resident time @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , i.e. @xmath43 returns the fraction of trajectories with a resident time between @xmath44 and @xmath45 . in this representation , for an exponential decay @xmath46 , the histogram on a logarithmic @xmath47-axis has a peak at @xmath48 .",
    "different peaks on the histogram are therefore related to processes with different desorption rates .",
    "the distribution of resident times reveals three peaks at 500 k : a nearly instantaneous desorption from site ( a ) ( low @xmath41 peak ) , a desorption from site ( g ) easily accessible from ( a ) ( peak at intermediate @xmath41 ) and finally desorption from trap states at longer @xmath41 .",
    "the peak due to desorption from site ( g ) reduces to a shoulder of the first peak in simulations with randomized activation energies . at higher temperatures the probability to reach the traps increases and the importance of longer resident times ( area of the peak at the longest @xmath41 ) increases .",
    "therefore , most of the radicals desorb quickly , without reaching the trap states , but a fraction of the adsorbed @xmath49 get to the trap , and remain adsorbed for longer times , of the order of @xmath50  s at @xmath51  k. the absolute position of the peaks in @xmath40 depends on the choice of the prefactor @xmath52 in the reaction rates , but the ratio of different positions and the relative area of the peaks do not .    * *    @>b0.05@>m0.95@ a ) +   +   + &   distribution of resident times @xmath41 of the silyl on the surface ( before desorption ) .",

    "the simplified model is able to reproduce the main features of the complete kmc results .",
    "both the shape of @xmath40 ( but for the smaller structure due to desorption from ( g ) ) and the order of magnitude of the average diffusion length are well reproduced .",
    "the simplified model can thus be considered as a good starting point to develop a more elaborate kmc model for realistic conditions with variable h and sih@xmath7 coverage .",
    "then , we have investigated the dependence of the results on the choice of different prefactors for different reactions . to this aim",

    "this suggests that the model is also relatively stable against changes in the estimated prefactors , making our predictions reliable , despite the unavoidable errors on energies and overall reaction rates .",
    "we can therefore conclude that desorption events prevents diffusion of @xmath30 radicals for more than a few lattice spacings .",
    "silyl migration can account for local rearrangement effects , resulting in an increase in the capture area of surface dangling bonds , but can not be invoked to explain long - range diffusion or surface smoothening on a mesoscopic scale .",

    "we have identified three classes of adsorption geometries : a set of physisorbed states with low adsorption energy ( @xmath13 5 mev ) , more strongly bound states with adsorption energies in the range 0.15 - 0.35 ev and a trap state with adsorption energy of 0.6 ev .",
    "the silyl can escape from the trap state and diffuse among the other more strongly bound minima .",
