    "chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath4pt ) was introduced as an effective field theory of qcd in a very low energy regime  @xcite . based on the chirally invariant lagrangian with a set of coefficients",
    ", @xmath4pt has been of great success in describing very low - energy phenomena of the strong interaction  @xcite  . while the structure of the lagrangian is determined by the symmetry pattern in qcd , the coefficients are unknown .",
    "these unknown coeffeicients , known as the low - energy constants ( lecs ) , contain microscopic information about the quark - gluon dynamics which would be in principle determined by qcd . however , it requires a formidable work to derive them from qcd and thus is impractical . in fact , they are fitted to the experimental data such as @xmath5 scattering and @xmath6 decay  @xcite and use them for describing or predicting other processes .",
    "however , when one goes beyond the leading order , the number of the lecs start to increase very rapidly .",
    "hence , it is not feasible to fix all lecs to empirical data .",
    "there has been a great amount of works on the lecs within various chiral models  @xcite .",
    "although dynamical ingredients of each model are different , almost all models are in good agreement with empirical data . apart from some models  @xcite",
    ", many models are based on local interactions of quarks and mesons . while the nonlocality of the quark can be neglected in the range of quark momenta , for example , @xmath7 in which @xmath8 denotes the average size of the instanton , recent works on the pion wave functions  @xcite and skewed parton distribution  @xcite show that it is of great importance to consider the momentum - dependent quark mass in order to produce the correct end - point behavior of the quark virtuality .",
    "similarly , a very recent study on the effective weak chiral lagrangian to order @xmath9 from the instanton vacuum  @xcite asserts that the nonlocality of the quark plays an essential role in improving previous results  @xcite concerning the @xmath10 rule in the lecs .",
    "furthermore , an appreciable merit of using the momentum - dependent quark mass as a regulator was already pointed out by ball and ripka  @xcite .",
    "the momentum - dependent quark mass provides a consistent regularization of the effective action in which its real and imaginary parts are treated on the same footing and thus pertinent observables such as anomalous decays @xmath11 are safely recovered even if @xmath12 acts as a regulator .    in the present work , we shall investigate the effective chiral lagrangian from the instanton vacuum  ( see a recent review  @xcite ) .",
    "we first consider the chiral limit as well as the absence of the external fields . in order to take into account the effect of su(3)-symmetry breaking",
    ", one has to modify the effective chiral action originally obtained by diakonov and petrov  @xcite .",
    "moreover , the vector and axial - vector currents are not conserved in the presence of the nonlocal interaction .",
    "thus , we first shall concentrate on the lecs in the chiral limit .",
    "the outline of the present paper is as follows : in section ii we briefly explain the instanton - induced chiral quark model , emphasizing in particular the momentum dependence of the constituent quark mass and explain how to perform the derivative expansion in the presence of the momentum - dependent constituent quark mass . in section iii ,",
    "we show how to derive the @xmath13 effective chiral lagrangian , using the derivative expansion . in section iv",
    ", we dicuss the results . in section",
    "v we draw conclusion and make summary .",
    "the instanton vacuum elucidates one of the most important low - energy properties of qcd , _",
    "i.e. _ the mechanism of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry  @xcite the banks - casher relation  @xcite tells us that the spectral density @xmath14 of the dirac operator at zero modes is proportional to the chiral condensate known as an order parameter of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry : @xmath15 the picture of the instanton vacuum provides a good realization of spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry .",
    "a finite density of instantons and antiinstantons produces the nonvanishing value of @xmath16 , which triggers the mechanism of chiral symmetry breaking .",
    "the euclidean quark propagator in the instanton vacuum acquires the following form with a momentum - dependent quark mass generated dynamically , identified with the coupling strength between quarks and goldstone bosons : @xmath17 with @xmath18 the ratio @xmath19 denotes the instanton density at equilibrium and the @xmath8 is the average size of the instanton .",
    "the form factor function @xmath20 is related to the fourier transform of the would - be zero fermion mode of individual instantons .",
    "the instanton density @xmath19 is expressed as a gap equation : @xmath21 taking the average instanton size @xmath22 fm , one obtains @xmath23 mev .",
    "the instanton vacuum induces effective @xmath24-fermion interactions  @xcite .",
    "for example , it has a type of the nambu - jona - lasinio model for @xmath25 while for @xmath26 it exhibits the t  hooft determinant  @xcite .",
    "goldstone bosons appear as collective excitations by quark loops generating a dynamic quark mass .",
    "eventually it is found that at low energies qcd is reduced to an interacting quark - goldstone boson theory given by the following euclidean partition function@xcite @xmath27 , \\label{eq : dirac}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 stands for the pseudo - goldstone boson : @xmath29 the @xmath30 is the color index , @xmath31 and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are flavor indices .",
    "@xmath12 is the constituent quark mass being now momentum - dependent , which is expressed by eq.([eq : mex ] ) .",
    "its momentum dependence will play a main role in the present work . if we choose @xmath20 to be constant and add a regularization ( _ e.g. _ pauli - villars or proper - time ) , the partition function becomes just that of the usual @xmath4qm .",
    "the original expression for the @xmath20  @xcite , which is obtained from the fourier transformation of the would - be zero fermion mode of individual instantons with the sharp instanton distribution assumed , is as follows : @xmath34 here @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 denote the modified bessel functions , z is defined as @xmath39 .",
    "when @xmath40 goes to infinity , the form factor @xmath20 has the following asymptotic behavior : @xmath41    actually , there are other ways of understanding the nonlocal effective interaction without relying on the instanton vacuum  @xcite . in those cases ,",
    "the momentum - dependent quark mass can be interpreted as a nonlocal regularization in euclidean space .",
    "hence , various types of the @xmath12 as a regulator with the regularization parameter @xmath42 has been used by different authors .",
    "for example , the dipole - type @xmath12 is used in the study of the pion wave function  @xcite , while the gaussian is employed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "therefore , we will not confine ourselves to the expression given in eq.([eq : fofk ] ) but rather try three different types of the @xmath12 : @xmath43 where the cut - off parameter @xmath44 is taken as the inverse of @xmath8 .",
    "the @xmath12 is normalized to @xmath45 at @xmath46 .",
    "originally , @xmath45 is found to be around @xmath47 mev .",
    "however , we will regard @xmath45 as a free parameter ranging from @xmath48 mev to @xmath49 mev and fit for each @xmath45 the parameter @xmath44 to the pion decay constant @xmath50 mev .",
    "figure  1 shows the momentum dependence of the three different types of @xmath12 with @xmath51  mev .",
    "the dipole type displays the largest tale , while the gaussian takes the strongly suppressed tail , compared to other ones . as will be shown later ,",
    "this difference appearing in the tail is basically responsible for the different results in the lecs of the effective weak chiral lagrangian .     on @xmath52 .",
    "the solid curve draws the diakonov - petrov @xmath12 , the dashed one shows the dipole - type parametrization of @xmath12 , and the dotted one corresponds to the gaussian type of @xmath12.,width=377,height=302 ]    this effective theory of quarks and light goldstone mesons applies to quark momenta up to the inverse size of the instanton , @xmath53 mev , which may act as a scale of the model ( @xmath54 ) . a merit to derive the @xmath4qm from the instanton vacuum lies in the fact that the scale of the model is naturally determined by @xmath55 .",
    "furthermore , mesons and baryons can be treated on the same footing in the @xmath4qm .",
    "for example , the model has been very successful in describing the properties of the baryons  @xcite .",

    "an appreciable merit of using the momentum - dependent quark mass as a regulator was already pointed out by ball and ripka  @xcite .",

    "hence , in this work , we will concentrate on the real part of the effective chiral action which will provide us with the effective chiral lagrangian with the lecs determined . in the present work ,",
