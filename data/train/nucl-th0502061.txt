    "the dissimilarity in the induced nucleon polarizations is most pronounced in forward knockout .",

    "is , even at low incoming neutrino - energies , strongly dominated by quasi - elastic scattering conditions , it inherits the characteristics dictated by the spin dependence of the equations in section [ formalism ] .",
    "going to larger scattering angles however , the momentum transfer and the ejectile momentum diverge and the required @xmath54 rotation of eq.([su2 ] ) becomes more and more influential , eventually reversing the polarization completely at @xmath67 .",
    "this behavior slightly limits the importance of the spin - down nucleon knockout for low incoming energies , while the reigning transverse forward ejectile knockout always assures the prominence of @xmath63 in the cross sections . at higher impinging neutrino energies , backward scattering becomes rather unimportant , as does @xmath62 ejectile knockout . with respect to the spin properties of the ejectile ,",
    "the longitudinal cross section exhibits the opposite behavior , but it is strongly suppressed .",
    "summarizing , the strong selectivity of @xmath61 reactions regarding the spin orientation of @xmath68 , can be attributed to three effects , reinforcing each other : first , the strong transverse dominance in the cross section , second its prominence in backward neutrino scattering going hand in hand with forward nucleon knockout , and third the strong spin dependence of the axial contribution in this transverse response .    the differences in the induced ejectile spins are clearly reflected by the polarization asymmetry @xmath69 , defined as the difference in ejectile polarization , normalized to the total nucleon knockout cross section  : @xmath70 where the superscript @xmath71 refers to the longitudinal spin components of the ejectile .",

    "as @xmath90 is always negative , @xmath86 is smaller than @xmath89 and the contribution of @xmath89 increases for growing energy transfers , making @xmath91 larger .",

    "the angular dependence of the asymmetry is however less pronounced than in the neutrino case , especially at larger values for the incoming lepton energy .",
