    "acceleration of the expansion of the universe is one of the most exciting and significant discoveries in physics , with implications that could revolutionize theories of quantum physics , gravitation , and cosmology . with its revelation",
    "that close to the three - quarters of the energy density of the universe , given the name dark energy , is of a new , unknown origin and that its exotic gravitational `` repulsion '' will govern the fate of the universe , dark energy and the accelerating universe becomes a topic not just of great interest to research physicists but to science students at all levels .",
    "this resource letter endeavors to guide teachers and interested scientists through the yet - inchoate field of dark energy .",
    "this subject is continuously developing and is somewhat amorphous , not well bounded due to our ignorance of from what part of physics the explanation of cosmic acceleration will stem .",
    "while this raises challenges for pedagogy , it also offers opportunities for giving a broad overview of the interplay of fundamental physics , cosmology , and astrophysics and a living example of how physics is a dynamic field with ongoing discoveries .",
    "the emphasis here is on a broad review along the lines of important concepts rather than specific theories , which rise and fall in popularity , and on the interaction of concepts with observational data .",
    "likewise , the focus for the resources listed is on the widest pedagogical usefulness rather than necessarily the original or latest literature ; arxiv.org ( ref .",
    "[ arxiv ] ) , the nasa astrophysical data system abstract service ( ref .  [ ads ] ) , and spires high energy physics ( ref .",
    "[ spires ] ) online servers have efficient searches for the specific literature .",
    "the references given to major conferences and to websites supplement these with overviews of the latest results and trends in thought .    historically , several issues led to dissatisfaction with the idea of a universe presently dominated by matter .",
    "these included the age problem of old objects in what dynamics would predict to be a young universe , the pattern of the large scale clustering of galaxies and clusters of galaxies , and the stability problem of a universe with density different from the critical density ( or nonzero spatial curvature ) . while there was a puzzle on the fundamental physics side ",
    "why did einstein s cosmological constant vanish ",
    "this was predominantly happily swept out of sight by an assumption that some symmetry would eventually explain it .",
    "observational evidence for a new component of the universe that brought relief to the astrophysical issues swept the scientific community in 1998 , from two independent groups measuring the cosmological distance - redshift relation of type ia supernovae , with quick support in the following years from cosmic microwave background data consistent with a critical density universe and more detailed large scale structure observations limiting the matter component contribution .",
    "however , the consistent picture on the cosmological side brought to the forefront the puzzle on the quantum side : from where did a cosmological constant of the precise magnitude needed arise , and was it in fact a true , constant vacuum energy ?",
    "the new picture of the universe was a dramatic copernican revolution . from abandonment of humans possessing a special spatial location in the universe , to abandonment of baryon chauvinism  that we are made of the typical stuff of the universe  due to dark matter , we now must abandon `` rest mass chauvinism ''  the large majority of the universe is not made of components dominated by their rest mass , like most of what we know , but rather is energy - like .",
    "moreover , this dark energy violates the strong energy condition , having effectively negative gravitating mass , so that we are forced to abandon newton and ask what happens when the force of gravity is no longer attractive .",
    "these are extraordinary , dramatic questions to face .",
    "the answers , which we in no wise know yet , will rewrite textbooks . in  [ sec : big ] we present resources giving a big picture overview of the impact that the discovery of the accelerating universe has had on cosmology research .",

    "further references in the form of books , conferences , and research and education websites appear in  [ sec : other ] .",
    "with the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe in 1998 , and its corroboration and more detailed measurement soon thereafter , cosmology and particle physics research took stock of the implications of these extraordinary results and shifted into high gear for exploration of the dark universe . for a comprehensive view of astrophysics in general just before this explosion of effort , see ref .",

    "coupled dark energy _",

    "[ arxiv ] to search on the terms in detail .",
    "here we summarize observational methods for probing dark energy and the accelerating universe , again without going into detail on technical specifics or proposed programs . while direct detection of acceleration is unlikely ( see ref .",
    "[ easyway ] ) , measurement of the cosmic expansion through geometric quantities such as distances depending only on the cosmic scale factor and spatial curvature is feasible . the slowing and acceleration of scales with time , @xmath2 , map out the cosmic environment history like the lesser and greater growth of tree rings map out the earth s climate history . the technique that discovered the acceleration , the type ia supernova magnitude - redshift test , is such a geometric test .",
    "once the supernovae are calibrated through measuring their properties , the magnitude , or received flux , measures the distance through the cosmological inverse square law , giving the lookback time to the explosion , while the measured redshift gives the scale factor ; hence we obtain @xmath2 .",
    "similar geometric probes can be gotten from distance ratios arising from gravitational lensing observations ( both weak lensing where one statistically measures subtle shape distortions in distant galaxies by foreground mass , and strong lensing where multiple images occur ) baryon acoustic oscillations ( statistically measuring the scale of preferred spatial clustering of galaxies or other baryon - rich objects relative to the primordial sound horizon scale from the cosmic microwave background recombination epoch ) , and possibly other techniques .    as a further consequence of the accelerated expansion ,",
    "the growth of large scale structure such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies is suppressed .",
    "structure grows through gravitational instability , but the stretching of space works against aggregation of mass just as a person finds it hard to join a large group of friends if they are at the end of an escalator running the wrong way .",
    "observations of the growth of massive structures through weak lensing , or the formation and evolution of galaxies and clusters , e.g.  cluster counts ( the abundance of clusters in a certain mass range ) , employing large surveys in the optical , submillimeter ( sunyaev - zeldovich effect ) , or x - ray bands , or again using weak gravitational lensing to detect mass , can thus give more indirect evidence of acceleration .",
    "other than for weak lensing , which directly measures mass , these techniques also need to translate the observed light to the true mass .",
    "methods that incorporate mass or mass and gas measurements in addition to simple geometry must separate out the astrophysics of galaxy and cluster formation and evolution to extract the cosmological dark energy characteristics .",
    "the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) radiation is a precise probe of many cosmological quantities , but is not particularly directly incisive on dark energy , at least in present usage .",
    "basically the cmb gives a snapshot of the early universe , at 0.003% of its present age , and so does not reveal detailed characteristics of the late time acceleration of the universe .",
    "these observational approaches to dark energy are discussed from both scientific and proposed experimental program points of view in the committee overviews cited in  [ sec : big ] and in the review articles in  [ sec : review ] .",

    "the area under a curve is simply the conformal distance @xmath7 , precisely the quantity that enters in luminosity distances and angular distances .",

    "introductory level courses can go a considerable way into the main concepts with very modest amounts of math .",
    "one key approach is emphasizing that einstein s equivalence principle and the equivalence of energy and mass ( `` @xmath10 '' ) yield a picture of dark energy opposed to attractive gravity .",
    "einstein lessoned us that when determining an object s gravitational mass we must add up all the forms of equivalent energy , including pressure .",
    "hence students can be guided to the idea that an object with positive energy density , but sufficiently negative pressure , can effectively have a negative gravitational mass , and hence acts in repulsion not attraction . using the rubber sheet image of spacetime ,",
    "while a ball of matter would cause a depression , experienced by other particles as gravitational attraction , a ball of dark energy causes a hill , perceived by other particles as gravitational repulsion ( if not quite in a formal sense ) .",
    "so the cosmic expansion , slowed down by gravitational attraction from the matter contents , can instead be accelerated if there is sufficient negative pressure material  dark energy .",
    "one can even motivate the friedmann acceleration equation from newton s second law , including einstein s admonition that we must account for pressure as a form of energy , and hence mass , as well .",
    "negative pressure can be made more palatable by pointing out that springs and rubber bands essentially have negative pressure . from the first law of thermodynamics",
    "we see that the ( adiabatic ) change in energy of a system when the volume changes is given by the negative of the pressure .",
    "the hot air inside your body cools when it expands out through pursed lips , as a student can easily demonstrate for themselves by blowing on their fingers ( working as temperature sensors ) with lips pursed or with mouth open .",
    "hence the pressure here is a positive quantity .",
    "however , when a spring or rubber band is expanded , the energy goes up , implying the pressure is a negative quantity .",
    "( again , students can demonstrate this by touching a rapidly stretched rubber band to their temperature - sensitive lips . )",
    "now perhaps the students have heard that quantum physics predicts that energy fields , even the zeropoint energy of the vacuum , should act as springs ( harmonic oscillators ) . lest their eyes glaze over at the mention of field theory , simply explain that a field in physics is not so different than a field of grass . on a lawn or in a meadow , each point has a stalk of grass of some height , like an array of springs of some length .",
    "a single number at every point is simply a scalar field @xmath11 ( and a trampled field of grass , or crop circles , where each stalk has a length and direction is like a vector field ) .",
    "quantum physics forbids the springs to be absolutely still , they must have some fluctuations , stretching and compressing .",
    "but as we saw with the rubber band , this leads to a negative pressure , so the vacuum itself can have negative pressure .",
    "putting it all together ,    * newton : gravitational force depends on acting gravitational mass * einstein : gravitational mass is equivalent to energy , including the pressure * @xmath12 * @xmath13 * gravitational `` repulsion '' or acceleration of the expanding universe can occur if there is sufficient negative pressure substance . *",
    "thermodynamics : negative pressure material is allowable , e.g.  springs * quantum physics : fields have zeropoint energy and this very vacuum acts like springs * @xmath12*@xmath13 * space itself has a vacuum energy with negative pressure that could accelerate the expansion of the universe .    a question than then naturally arises , of considerable pedagogical and scientific interest , is what is the fate of our universe .",
    "for many years in cosmology , it was declared that geometry equals fate .",
    "models were characterized into open , closed , and critical universes ( eternally expanding , eventually contracting , and asymptotically static ) , taken to be equivalent to negative , positive , and zero spatial curvature models . for accelerating universes , this identification breaks down and one can have open universes with positive curvature , for example . both the amount and the nature of components enter into determining the fate of the universe .",
    "thus the newtonian picture of throwing a ball into the air and based on the initial velocity it will either return to earth , orbit , or escape no longer holds ; with sufficiently negative equation of state ( pressure to energy density ratio ) the gravitating mass of the ball can be negative and a softly thrown ball can accelerate away .    in an accelerating universe",
    ", the particle horizon ( the region within the causally reachable universe ) grows rapidly , more rapidly than the speed of light , so as time goes on we see an increasingly small fraction of the universe ; effectively , the limits to our astronomy close in as galaxies that used to be visible get pulled away and fade out of sight .",

    "[ dyson]-[eschat ] ) .",
    "if the equation of state is even more negative , beyond the cosmological constant value of pressure equal and opposite of the energy density , the dark energy becomes `` phantom '' ( see ref .",
    "[ phantom ] ) .",
    "this leads to the energy density of the substance _ increasing _ as the expansion dilutes it , and the expansion superaccelerating , in a runaway process called the big rip .",
    "naively this would lead to the rapid expansion eventually tearing apart galaxies , stars , and even atoms ( see ref .",
    "[ bigrip ] ) but quantum particle creation might intervene , ending the runaway .",
