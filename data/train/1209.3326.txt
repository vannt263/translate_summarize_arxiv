    "these compact sets are called _ removable _ and are precisely those of zero analytic capacity .",
    "painlev s problem has been extensively studied in the last decades and is now considered solved .",
    "see e.g. * @xcite * for a survey of painlev s problem and related results .",
    "the study of analytic capacity became even more interesting with vitushkin s work on uniform rational approximation * @xcite*. vitushkin showed that analytic capacity plays a central role in the theory of uniform rational approximation of holomorphic functions on compact subsets of the plane .",
    "see e.g. * @xcite * for a survey of the applications of analytic capacity to this type of problem .",
    "we also mention that analytic capacity is used in fluid dynamics to study the @xmath9-dimensional velocity fields induced by several obstacles , see e.g. * @xcite*.    in this article , we are primarily interested in the computation of analytic capacity",
    ". more precisely , our main objectives are    * to obtain a quick and efficient method to compute the analytic capacity of `` nice '' compact sets . * to use this method to investigate the ( still open ) _ subadditivity problem _ for analytic capacity .",
    "the article is structured as follows .",
    "section [ sec2 ] contains the necessary preliminaries on analytic capacity . in section [ sec3 ]",
    ", we obtain some estimates for the analytic capacity of a compact set with @xmath10 boundary .",
    "then , in section [ sec4 ] , we prove that the same estimates remain valid in the case of compact sets with piecewise - analytic boundary ( subject to suitable modifications ) .",
    "the proof relies on properties of the _ smirnov classes _",
    "@xmath11 on finitely connected domains . in section [ sec5 ]",
    ", we use these estimates to obtain a numerical method for the computation of analytic capacity .",
    "the method gives upper and lower bounds for the analytic capacity @xmath12 , and we prove that these bounds can be made arbitrarily close , thus converging to the true value of @xmath12 . in section [ sec6 ] ,",
    "we present several numerical examples , in the case of analytic boundary as well as in the case of piecewise - analytic boundary .",
    "the last two sections , section [ sec7 ] and section [ sec8 ] , are dedicated to the study of the subadditivity problem for analytic capacity .",
    "the problem is the following : _ is it true that @xmath13 is subadditive , in the sense that @xmath14 for all compact sets @xmath15 ?",
    "_ vitushkin conjectured in * @xcite * that analytic capacity is _ semi - additive _",
    ", i.e. @xmath16 for some universal constant @xmath17 .",
    "he gave various applications of this inequality to rational approximation .",
    "semi - additivity of analytic capacity was proved by tolsa * @xcite*. in fact , tolsa proved that analytic capacity is countably semi - additive .",
    "however , it is still unknown whether or not one can take the constant @xmath17 equal to @xmath18 .",
    "davie * @xcite * gives some applications of the subadditivity of analytic capacity to rational approximation theory .    in section [ sec7 ]",
    ", we first use a discrete approach to analytic capacity ( introduced by melnikov * @xcite * ) to prove that the subadditivity of analytic capacity is equivalent to the subadditivity in the special case where the compact sets @xmath19 are disjoint finite unions of disjoint disks , all with the same radius .",
    "this result is quite convenient because the numerical method described in section [ sec5 ] is very efficient for computing the analytic capacity of such compact sets .",
    "then we use a discrete version of analytic capacity , also introduced by melnikov * @xcite * , to obtain a result regarding the behavior of the ratio @xmath20 as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are disjoint finite unions of disjoint disks , all with radius  @xmath24 .",
    "finally , in section [ sec8 ] , we formulate a conjecture based , among other things , on numerical evidence .",
    "a proof of this conjecture would imply that analytic capacity is subadditive .",
    "we end the section by giving a proof in a special case .    in the article",
    ", we shall use the letter @xmath2 to denote a domain in the riemann sphere , that is , an open and connected subset of @xmath25 .",
    "furthermore , when @xmath2 is said to be a finitely connected domain with analytic ( respectively piecewise - analytic ) boundary , we mean that the boundary of @xmath2 consists of a finite number of pairwise disjoint analytic ( respectively piecewise - analytic ) jordan curves . finally , we shall use @xmath26 to denote the set of complex - valued functions that are continuous in @xmath27 , the closure of @xmath2 in @xmath25 , and holomorphic in @xmath2 .",
    "in a sense , analytic capacity measures the size of a set as a non - removable singularity for bounded holomorphic functions .",
    "a direct consequence of the definition is that @xmath13 is _ monotone _ : @xmath28 it is also easy to prove that @xmath29 for every @xmath30 and compact set @xmath0 . in particular , @xmath13 is invariant under translation .",

    "@xmath38 , this function @xmath35 is unique in the unbounded component of @xmath2 and is called the _ ahlfors function _ for @xmath0 .",
    "one verifies easily that the ahlfors function @xmath35 vanishes at @xmath39 .    from schwarz s lemma",

    "one way to prove theorem [ theo1 ] is to use the following result :    [ theo2 ] suppose that @xmath2 is a finitely connected domain with analytic boundary .",
    "then there exists a holomorphic function @xmath48 in @xmath2 which is the unique solution to the dual extremal problem @xmath49 moreover , @xmath48 has the following properties :    1 .",

    "the reason behind this will be clear soon .",
    "accordingly , we shall assume that @xmath23 is @xmath10 on the boundary .",
    "this will be the case , for example , if all the boundary curves of @xmath2 are @xmath10 .",
    "this is a consequence of the following result , which dates back to painlev s doctoral thesis :    let @xmath88 be a bounded jordan domain with @xmath10 boundary , and let @xmath35 be a conformal mapping of @xmath88 onto the unit disk @xmath40 .",
    "then @xmath35 is @xmath10 on @xmath89 , the derivative @xmath90 does not vanish on @xmath89 , and @xmath91 is @xmath10 on the closed unit disk .    for a proof ,",

    "this question was answered in the affirmative by smith @xcite and also by suita @xcite .",
    "this fact leads to a natural definition of the garabedian function for an arbitrary compact plane set , though we shall not need this degree of generality here .",
