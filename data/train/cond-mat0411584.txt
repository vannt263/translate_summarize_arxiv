    "biaxial liquid - crystalline phases were hypothesized in 1970 by freiser @xcite . since",
    "then many theoretical models have described the conditions that promote biaxial order . however , the experimental search for biaxial phases has been unfruitful until very recently , when madsen et al .",
    "@xcite and acharya et al .",
    "@xcite presented convincing evidence for the existence of biaxial order in a fluid composed of boomerang - shaped molecules . in previous work schlacken",
    "@xcite analyzed the effect of particle shape on the orientational properties of two - dimensional fluids using scaled - particle theory ( spt ) .",
    "they considered hard ellipses and hard rectangles ( hr ) and , for the latter , located a spinodal which corresponds to a tetratic phase , where the fluid has two nematic directors oriented perpendicular to each other .",
    "simulation works have been performed by cuesta and frenkel @xcite on hard ellipses and by bates and frenkel @xcite who focused on hard discorectangles ( hdr ) and the character of the orientational transition from the isotropic phase .",
    "also lagomarsino et al .",
    "@xcite found similar behavior in a fluid of hard spherocylinders confined between two parallel walls which , in the limit of small wall separation , can be considered as a realization of a two - dimensional nematic .",
    "these simulations have shown that the character of orientational transitions depends strongly on the particle shape : whereas for hard discorectangles the isotropic - nematic transition is of the kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) type@xcite in the whole aspect ratio regime where the nematic phase is stable against the solid phase@xcite , for hard ellipses a tricritical point separates regions of continuous from first order orientational transition @xcite .",
    "the density functional ( df ) formalism has been proven to be a powerful tool in the study of bulk nonuniform phases of liquid crystals in three dimensions , specifically for the model of freely rotating hard spherocylinders @xcite@xmath0@xcite . to our knowledge , in two dimensions",
    "the df formalism has been applied only to the study of uniform liquid - crystalline phases . in the present work",
    "we will not focus on questions related to the kt nature of the isotropic - nematic phase transition , but rather we investigate by df theory the occurrence of biaxial nematic order in fluids and how this feature depends on the geometry of the particles ; we consider both hr and hdr as interaction models .",
    "also we apply df theory to the study of spinodal instabilities to nonuniform phases in order to analyze the relative stability of these biaxial phases against spatially ordered phases .",
    "the results from the theory allow us to conclude that a certain degree of biaxiality is present in the case of hr .",
    "this is truly remarkable , since this order arises in a one - component system of particles with uniaxial symmetry .",
    "however the bifurcation analysis using the df theory allow us to conclude that the tetratic phase is metastable w.r.t .",
    "the solid phase .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized as follows : in section ii we introduce the theoretical models for both the uniform phases ( spt in section ii.a ) and for the non - uniform ones ( df in section ii.b ) .",
    "subsection ii.c is devoted to the bifurcation analysis .",
    "results are shown in section iii while some conclusions are drawn in section iv .",
    "the df approximation proposed is based on spt , which has proved to be a generic theory which is easily extended to any convex particle geometry @xcite .",
    "two extensions , suitable for nonuniform phases , are proposed .",
    "both tend to the spt in the limit of uniform phases and take into account ideas from fundamental measure theory ( fmt ) .",
    "this theory has been worked out for a system of hard parallelepipeds in the restricted orientations approximation ( the so - called zwanzig model@xcite ) and the corresponding phase diagram , including all nonuniform phases , was recently calculated @xcite .",
    "one of the proposed extensions recovers the onsager second - order virial theory in the low - density limit .",
    "the other version is built so as to recover the fmt for parallel hard rectangles , i.e. restricting the particle orientations to point along the nematic director .",
    "the construction of a functional which interpolates between the onsager limit and the high density one using fmt for hard spheres has been proposed by cinacchi and schmid for a system of hard spherocylinders in three dimensions@xcite . nevertheless their proposal seems to be numerically intractable for nonuniform phases .",
    "here we are interested in constructing a workable density functional .",
    "the radically different orientational ordering properties shown by the two particle models , hdr and hr ( see fig .",
    "[ figm1 ] ) , can be understood in the framework of spt .",
    "a brief discussion of this theory , as applied to our model systems , follows .    the key quantity to derive the theory is the excluded volume between fluid particles of length @xmath1 ( hr ) or @xmath2 ( hdr ) and width @xmath3 , and a test scaled particle of dimension @xmath4 and @xmath5 with fixed orientation @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the angle between the uniaxial axis and the nematic director .",
    "the excluded volume is to be averaged over all possible orientations of the fluid particles , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the one - particle orientational distribution function , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 is the excluded volume between two particles which , for rectangles , has the form @xmath12 with @xmath13 , whereas for discorectangles @xmath14 the reversible work required to insert the scaled particle with fixed orientation ( which coincides with the excess chemical potential ) is , in the limit of small sizes@xcite @xmath15 : @xmath16 , \\label{magnitud}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath17 is the fluid density . in the opposite limit of large sizes",
    "@xmath18 , this work coincides with the thermodynamic reversible work necessary to open a cavity of volume equal to the scaled - particle volume ( @xmath19 ) , which is equal to @xmath20 , @xmath21 being the fluid pressure .",
    "spt interpolates between these two limits using a taylor expansion around @xmath22 , where the second - order term is @xmath20 and , finally , the sizes are taken to be those of the fluid particles , which results in @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the packing fraction and @xmath25 , with @xmath26 the particle volume .",

    "the isotropic phase gets unstable with respect to the uniaxial nematic phase , n@xmath50 , ( @xmath51 ) when the following condition holds : @xmath52 .",
    "another possibility is that the isotropic phase gets unstable when @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "this bifurcation corresponds to a phase with d@xmath56 symmetry , which we call _ tetratic _ , n@xmath57 .",
    "the above conditions occur for the following values of the packing fractions : @xmath58 the equality of these two values gives a critical aspect ratio @xmath59 such that , when @xmath60 , the n@xmath57 phase preempts the n@xmath50 phase .    in order to calculate the complete phase diagram for uniform phases we minimized the full free energy per particle for each @xmath61 with respect to the @xmath37 coefficients",
    "a common - tangent construction was used to locate coexistence boundaries in the case of first - order transitions . to characterize the orientational order we have used the following order parameters : @xmath62",
    "two different approximations are being proposed for the excess part of free energy density @xmath63 which defines the interaction part of the free energy functional as @xmath64 .",
    "the first one will later be used to calculate the spinodal instabilities of the hr fluid against nonuniform phases .    as an important ingredient of any density functional approximation for freely rotating anisotropic particles",
    ", we need to impose the onsager form for the excess part of the free - energy density in the low density limit :    @xmath65    where @xmath66 is the mayer function between two particles with orientations @xmath7 and @xmath67 .",
    "another important feature is that the functional capture correctly the high - density limit .",
    "for this purpose we will use the fmt to include the remaining part of the density dependence and ensure , in this way , the high density limit .",
    "this dependence enters through the weighted densities @xmath68@xcite .",
    "finally we impose that the scaled particle theory be recovered in the uniform limit .    as a first proposal we write the following form for the excess part of the free energy density : @xmath69- \\frac{n_0({\\bf r})n_2({\\bf r})}{1-n_2({\\bf r})}\\nonumber \\\\ & + & \\left[(1-n_2)^{-1 } \\ast \\omega^{(0)}_y\\right]({\\bf r})\\phi_{\\rm{exc}}^{\\rm{ons}}({\\bf r } ) , \\label{first}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath70 s are defined as @xmath71({\\bf r})$ ] , i.e. they are convolutions of the averaged density profile of rectangles , @xmath72 , with some weighting functions given by the expressions @xmath73 where @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the dirac delta function and the heaviside function , respectively .",
    "an important property of the above proposal is that it recovers the spt theory in the uniform limit .",
    "note that weighting functions are the characteristic functions which define the support of the particle geometry ( a rectangle parallel to the @xmath76 axis ) and its total surface area @xcite ( their integrals are two of the fundamental measures of the particles ) .",
    "note also that , in order to numerically implement the theory , the simplest choice is to take a system of parallel hr as a reference system .",
    "another possibility is to use as a reference system a fluid of parallel hard squares with particles having the same volume as that of the rectangles .",
    "this choice may be more adequate to describe isotropic nonuniform phases such as the plastic solid ( for which the lattice period is the same in the @xmath77 and @xmath76 directions ) , whereas the former choice should be better for the oriented solid phases .",
    "both reference systems will later be used to calculate the spinodal instabilities to nonuniform phases .    a possible improvement of the theory would be to get rid of the reference system of parallel particles and generalize the definitions of weighting functions ( [ weight0 ] ) and ( [ weight2 ] ) to describe freely rotating particles :    @xmath78    where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the new cartesian coordinates in a system rotated by the local angle @xmath81 of the particle , measured w.r.t .",

    "this approach will not be pursued any further and we leave it for future work .    as can be seen the prefactor of the function @xmath86 in eq .",
    "( [ first ] ) depends on the density profile defined in a rectangular region centered at @xmath87 with dimensions @xmath88 .",
    "this is not the usual case in the formulation of the fmt from first principles , but it is necessary because the term @xmath86 depends on the mayer functions which have the range of the excluded surface area .    in order to test the performance of this version of df",
    "we will apply it to the study of freezing in a parallel hard - square ( phs ) fluid and compare the results with the fmt derived in @xcite .",
    "this test is motivated by the fact that the close packing limit is easier to reach in this system compared with the freely rotating case and thus the possible divergences inherent to the particular functional structure can be more easily elucidated .",
    "the density profile of the solid phase was parameterized using gaussian peaks centered at the sites of a square lattice and the fraction of vacancies was included through a normalization factor in the profile .",
    "the minimization of the functional was carried out with respect to the gaussian width and occupancy probability @xmath89 ( one minus the fraction of vacancies ) .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] where the fluid and solid equations of state ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]a ) and the occupancy probability vs packing fraction ( fig .",
    "[ fig0]b ) are plotted .",
    "comparison is made between results from the present theory and fmt .",
    "the fluid branch is the same because , as already pointed out , our theory recovers spt .",
    "note that the new version stabilizes the solid phase at a lower packing fraction @xmath90 with a fraction of vacancies @xmath91 , to be compared with the fmt result ( @xmath92 and @xmath93 ) .",
    "the lattice parameter , @xmath94 , of the solid phase at the bifurcation point , as calculated from the mean density @xmath95 , is equal to 1.353 from the present version and 1.254 from fmt .",
    "all of these results indicate that both functionals produce similar results and , what is more important , the new functional is regular for this kind of density profiles ( note that a free minimization would be required to completely settle this point ) .",
    "another possibility to construct a df for freely rotating hard rectangles is to impose that this functional recover the fundamental measure functional ( fmf ) when the density profile is chosen to have the form @xmath96 , i.e. the system of parallel hard rectangles .",

    "note that the n@xmath57 phase presents two peaks of the same height ( consistent with this phase being invariant with respect to the d@xmath56 symmetry group ) .",
    "by contrast , the n@xmath50 phase also presents a secondary peak ( indicating a certain degree of biaxiality in this phase ) , but of a smaller height . if @xmath61 is increased the height of this secondary peak reduces compared to the main peak , eventually disappearing .",
    "we now show the results for hard discorectangles .",
    "we have implemented the same calculational scheme and obtained the phase diagram .",

    "a key difference between hard rectangles and hard discorectangles is that in the former case the excluded volume expression contains a cosine term which is absent in the latter case .",

    "it can be seen that the two equations of state show a similar behavior , except in the neighborhood of the corresponding phase transitions , which are of first and second order for rectangles and discorectangles , respectively .      to elucidate the absolute stability of the tetratic nematic phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) , we have carried out a bifurcation analysis following the lines described in section [ bif ] , i.e. solving eqns .",
    "( [ bifurca_1 ] ) and ( [ bifurca_2 ] ) in order to find the values of the packing fraction and wave vector for which the uniform phases destabilize to nonuniform phases .",

    "[ fig5 ] is in fact the same as fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , but spinodal lines from the above bifurcation analysis have been superimposed and , at the same time , transition lines in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] which turn out to be preempted by nonuniform phases have been dropped .    as can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , for @xmath144 the i phase destabilizes directly to the s phase , so the tetratic nematic phase is not stable .",
    "nevertheless , a tetratic order is possible in spatially ordered phases .",
    "taking into account that the i - s transition is probably of first order a complete functional minimization with respect to two dimensional density profiles is required to settle this question . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] the nonuniform phase spinodals are calculated using two reference systems : parallel rectangles and parallel squares . as was discussed in section [ version_1 ]",
    ", the last one should better describe the i - s transition , whereas the former should be more appropriate for the n@xmath143-s transition .",
    "in other words , the dotted line should be more reliable for @xmath145 , whereas the solid line is expected to be more accurate for @xmath146 ( note that both reference systems give similar results in the first region and naturally these results coincide exactly at @xmath147 ) .",
    "if we use the density functional for freely rotating particles without a reference system of parallel particles ( see section [ version_1 ] ) , the fluid - solid transition is expected to shift to higher densities .",
    "the reason for this behavior is that a reference system composed of parallel particles enhances a crystalline local order which is absent in the isotropic phase .",
    "nevertheless , we expect that , within the present version of the theory , the tetratic phase still remains unstable w.r.t . the solid phase .",
    "calculations using this functional is a task in progress and will allow us to finally settle this question .",
    "the main conclusion of the present work is that different particle geometries may account for the different nature of the orientational phase transitions involved ( continuous versus first order with a tricriticcal point ) .",
    "but , even more important , particles possessing uniaxial symmetry ( hard rectangles ) may lead to a phase with a dramatically different symmetry : the tetratic phase .",
    "this finding is based upon minimization of a density - functional theory constructed using ideas from spt .",
    "however , the tetratic phase has been found to be only metastable with respect to a spatially ordered phase .",
    "this result was obtained using a bifurcation analysis of a version of density - functional theory proposed in the present paper .",
    "the theory combines the onsager functional with the fmf for hard rectangles .",
    "a word of caution is in order here : the proposed functional does not reproduce the exact third virial coefficient , which is expected to be of vital importance at high density , and these neglected correlations should play a role of paramount importance in the stabilization of a phase with tetratic symmetry .",
    "it might well be that a full theory , incorporating correlations between three particles , could stabilize the tetratic phase even further and predict it to be stable at densities below that at which crystallization occurs .",
    "nevertheless , it is interesting to note that the present theory already confirms that an oriented fluid of hard rectangles presents some degree of biaxial order for small aspect ratios . the theory could also be used to predict the stability of a number of two - dimensional phases that occur in langmuir monolayers@xcite .    previous work on polydisperse mixtures of hard spherocylinders @xcite , or parallelepipeds@xcite in three dimensions ,",
    "have shown that polydispersity enhances the stability of the uniform phases w.r.t .",
    "nonuniform phases .",
    "while columnar order admits a higher degree of polydispersity , the smectic or solid phases normally have a terminal polydispersity beyond which these phases are no longer stable@xcite .",
    "this fact can be easily understood if we take into account that : i ) any periodic packing is difficult to attain in a mixture of particles with different characteristic lengths and ii ) mixing increases the ideal mixing entropy of uniform phases and , as a consequence , decreases the helmholtz free energy .",
    "thus , some degree of polydispersity ( either unimodal or bimodal ) will certainly increase the density of the transition from the fluid to a spatially ordered phase in a polydisperse mixture of hard rectangles .",
    "is this effect enough to stabilize the tetratic phase ?",

    "<S> using a version of density - functional theory which combines onsager approximation and fundamental - measure theory for spatially nonuniform phases , we have studied the phase diagram of freely rotating hard rectangles and hard discorectangles . </S>",
    "<S> we find profound differences in the phase behavior of these models , which can be attributed to their different packing properties . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , bimodal orientational distribution functions are found in the nematic phase of hard rectangles , which cause a certain degree of biaxial order , albeit metastable with respect to spatially ordered phases . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is absent in discorectangles , which always show unimodal behavior . </S>",
    "<S> this result may be relevant in the light of recent experimental results which have confirmed the existence of biaxial phases . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that some perturbation of the particle shapes ( either a certain degree of polydispersity or even bimodal dispersity in the aspect ratios ) may actually destabilize spatially ordered phases thereby stabilizing the biaxial phase . </S>"
