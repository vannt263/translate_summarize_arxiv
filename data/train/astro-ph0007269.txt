    "qso 2237 + 0305 ( z=1.695 , huchra et al . 1985 ) , referred to hereafter as `` the einstein cross , '' is the first gravitationally lensed qso with confirmed variations due to lensing by the stars in the lens galaxy ( z=0.0395 ) , referred to as  microlensing \" ( irwin et al .",
    "optical variations of @xmath2 magnitudes due to microlensing are observed at least once per year ( racine 1992 ) , which implies the optical emission region is smaller than an einstein radius , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the mass of the lensing star in solar masses and @xmath5 .",
    "the peak magnification and time scale of a high amplification event ( caused by a caustic crossing the qso ) is strongly dependent on the size of the qso .",
    "an event in 1988 has been used to limit the optical source size to about @xmath6 cm ( wambsganss , schneider , & paczyski 1990 , rauch & blandford 1991 , wyithe et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "typically qsos have a change in spectral slope near 1@xmath0 in the rest frame , which may imply that different physical components contribute longward and shortward of this wavelength ( neugebauer et al .",
    "1987 , sanders et al .",
    "1989 , barvainis 1993 , begelman 1994 ) .",
    "one way to distinguish these components is reverberation mapping : observations of a few seyfert galaxies indicate that the infrared emission region is more extended than the optical ( barvainis 1992 , nelson 1996 ) .",
    "however , there exist no such direct constraints on the size of the infrared emission in qsos ; recent observations indicate this region may be rather compact , although the data are ambiguous ( neugebauer & matthews 1999 ) .",
    "another technique for constraining the size of the emission region in qsos is gravitational microlensing .",
    "sources larger than an einstein radius have smaller fluctuations than sources smaller than an einstein radius ( kayser , refsdal , & stabell 1986 ) . despite its potential for probing the qso central engine ,",
    "microlensing has not yet been looked for in the mid - infrared ( @xmath7 ) .",
    "currently the most popular model of the infrared ( ir ) spectrum in qsos is thermal emission from hot dust .",
    "evidence includes the lack of ir variability in most qsos and the ubiquitous spectral dip around one micron which can be ascribed to dust sublimation at a temperature of @xmath8k .",
    "however , some radio quiet qsos show phased ir / optical variability ( neugebauer & matthews 1999 ) , and dust absorption features are not generally seen in the mid - ir in bright agn ( roche et al . 1991 ) . alternatively , the ir spectrum could be dominated by nonthermal synchrotron emission from the region near the black hole .",
    "microlensing variability in the mid - ir can place a limit on the size of the source , distinguishing between dust and synchrotron models .",
    "the _ minimum _ radius at which dust can exist near the central engine is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the qso luminosity , @xmath11 is the dust emissivity , and @xmath12 is the dust sublimation temperature .",
    "@xmath13 is larger than @xmath14 so that if dust is responsible for the emission , microlensing fluctuations will be very small ( @xmath15 magnitudes for @xmath16 , refsdal and stabell 1991 ) .    on the other hand , if the infrared emission is due to synchrotron , then a turnover should be present at low frequencies due to self - absorption .",
    "such turnovers are typically observed in quasars in the far infrared , but they are much steeper than the @xmath17 behavior expected from homogeneous self - absorbed synchrotron models ( hughes et al .",
    "1993 ) . nevertheless , if such a turnover is due to self - absorption , then the requirement that the source be optically thick at the turnover frequency places a strong upper bound on the size of the emission region of @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the flux at the turnover wavelength @xmath20 , and @xmath21 is the magnetic field in the emission region .",
    "unfortunately the einstein cross lies in a region of the sky which was not surveyed by _ iras _ , so the far infrared flux and turnover wavelength are unknown .",
    "the typical flux in the far - infrared for a qso as bright as the einstein cross is @xmath22 10 mjy , so the size of the synchrotron emission region is expected to be comparable to the optical size ( where @xmath21 could be @xmath23  g ) .",
    "the limit on the size of a synchrotron emitting region is therefore much smaller than @xmath14 .",
    "if synchrotron emission is responsible for the ir , then microlensing variations in this region of the spectrum will be at least as large as in the optical .",
    "a lack of microlensing might allow measurement of the amplification due to the gravitational lens galaxy .",
    "if the ir emission is due to dust , then it will not be microlensed , and , as emphasized by kochanek ( 1991 ) , would provide a direct measurement of the relative magnifications due to the lens galaxy rather than due to microlensing ( although microlensing by clusters of stars can still affect a large emission region ) .",
    "this data is required for accurate modeling of this lens ( witt and mao 1994 ) .",
    "this has been attempted by using the ciii ] line , which originates from the extended broad line region and is therefore not microlensed ( yee & de robertis 1992 , racine 1992 , fitte & adam 1994 , saust 1994 , lewis et al . 1998 ) ; however , the ciii ] line is affected by extinction and continuum subtraction . to avoid these problems ,",
    "the flux ratios were measured in the radio by falco et al .",
    "( 1996 ) with a signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of only 2 - 4 .",
    "one can do much better in the ir . assuming a power - law mass distribution in the lensing galaxy ( @xmath24 ) , wambsganss & paczyski ( 1994 ) demonstrated that the total magnification of the lens could vary dramatically as @xmath25 varies .",
    "their model predicts different flux ratios between the four images as @xmath25 varies , so measuring the flux ratios of an extended source might constrain the total amplification .",
    "we present the first observations of the einstein cross near 10 microns ( @xmath223 microns rest frame ) .",
    "these observations were taken at keck , which is the only telescope with a large enough collecting area to detect such a faint qso .",
    "in addition , at 10 microns it is diffraction limited with about @xmath26 resolution , making it easy to distinguish between the four images which have a smallest separation of about [ timtab]@xmath27 in section 2 , the observations are discussed . in section 3 , the data reduction is discussed and the results are presented . in section 4",
    "the implications for emission models and lens models are discussed . in section 5",
    "the results are summarized and future directions are pointed out .",
    "the einstein cross was observed with the keck long wavelength spectrometer ( lws ) on three nights in 1999 .",
    "the lws is a 128@xmath28 128 boeing si : as array with a @xmath29 field of view at the cassegrain focus of keck i ( jones & puetter 1993 ) .",
    "the lws was used in imaging mode with chop and nod which were necessary due to the faintness of the source and sky variability .",
    "the chop and nod were both fixed at @xmath30 , which is off of the lws chip .",

    "total observing times and on - source integration times are listed in table [ timtab ] .",
    "in addition to observing the qso , the stars hr 5616 , 4 lac , and hr 8551 were observed ( near the same airmass ) at 11.7 microns , yielding 13,300 adu / jy / sec with a standard deviation of 5% for different objects and different nights .",

    "as the qso is rather faint , it is not detected in any single frame , which typically consists of about five minutes of integration . to detect the qso ,",
    "the data were de - dithered and successive frames were added . due to imperfect pointing , the de - dithering can cause some broadening of the point - spread - function ( psf ) . as the qso is too faint to allow correction of pointing errors for individual frames ,",
    "the stellar psf was convolved with gaussians of various widths to see how this affects the results , as discussed below .",

    "was convolved with a gaussian , varying the fwhm until the best fit was obtained for each image .",

    "this demonstrates that the _ relative _ flux ratios are rather insensitive to the gaussian fwhm .",

    "simultaneous with the keck observations were strong optical microlensing events in images a and c at the time of the infrared observations ( ogle website ; woniak et al .",

    "\\7 ) consider a model in which a point source and an extended source contribute to the infrared flux ( which would be the case if both a dusty torus and synchrotron source contributed to the infrared flux ) .",
    "then , the synchrotron source would be magnified by the same amount as the optical ( due to microlensing ) , while the extended source would be magnified by the macrolensing magnification ( assuming the swl model holds ) . with these assumptions",
    "one can compute what the fraction of point source flux is relative to the extended source flux in order to give the infrared flux ratios . carrying out this exercise",
    ", one finds that the point source contribution must be _ negative _ to explain the difference between images a and b or a and c. simply put , the infrared flux ratio of b is larger than the model , while the point source ( i.e. optical ) is smaller than the model ( see table [ tab2 ] ) , so adding a point source to an extended source can only decrease the flux with respect to the model . since the point source flux must be non - negative ,",
    "it is most likely zero .",
    "then , the disagreement between the infrared flux ratios and the model flux ratios is probably due to inaccuracies in the lens model , poisson fluctuations due to a random number of lenses passing in front of a given image ( since the source is not truly infinite ) , and/or errors in the measured fluxes .    given these lines of evidence , one concludes that the mid - infrared emission region is larger than the einstein radius of a typical star in the lens galaxy , about @xmath49 cm . the infrared may be extended by @xmath50 which corresponds to about 0.8 kpc in the source plane ; however , this extension is possibly due to pointing errors as discussed above .",

    "the inferred source size agrees with the dust sublimation estimate _ and _ with the microlensing size constraint .",

    "a clumpy disk model should have a similar spectrum since the smaller filling factor can be compensated by an increase in dust number density .",
    "the conclusion is that the narrow infrared peak requires a narrow range of radii ( factor of 3 ) so that reprocessed luminosity is absorbed by a region with a narrow range of dust temperature .",

    "transient heating by x - rays causes temperature flickering which broadens the spectrum ; this is only important for dust grains with radii @xmath84 ( voit 1991 ) .",
    "infrared radiation transfer has been ignored since the shell is optically thin by construction ; reality may not be so simple . a warped disk with a warp angle which scales logarithmically radius would produce a much wider infrared bump than observed .",
    "normal galaxies can be well described by a 3500 k blackbody in the near infrared spectral region ( schmitt et al .",
    "1997 ) , which peaks at a wavelength of about @xmath85 ( rest ) , while the einstein cross spectrum peaks closer to @xmath86 ( rest ) .",
    "thus , to fit the infrared bump requires strong extinction as in a starburst galaxy : an extinction of @xmath87 is needed to fit the infrared bump ; most of the light is absorbed by dust .",
    "the absorbed luminosity is @xmath88 erg / s , which must be re - radiated in the far - infrared ( fir ) .",
    "the radio - fir relation ( condon 1992 ) limits the fir luminosity to @xmath89 erg / s , a factor of 10 times smaller than the absorbed luminosity .",
    "a test of the host galaxy hypothesis would be to look for an extended source in the ir images .",
    "meurer et al .",
    "( 1997 ) have found an empirical limit on the bolometric surface brightness of starburst galaxies of @xmath90 , which would indicate that this starburst has a size of @xmath91 3.5 kpc , or @xmath92 ( including the factor of @xmath93 stretch due to lensing ) . this is larger than the infrared upper lmit of @xmath36 , ruling out a starburst as the origin of the infrared bump .",
    "one can roughly estimate the host galaxy luminosity from the qso luminosity as follows .",
    "rauch & blandford ( 1991 ) have argued that sub - eddington accretion disk models are too large to be consistent with the optical size constraint from microlensing .",
    "we confirmed this by fitting the optical / uv sed with various thin accretion disk models from hubeny et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ; all disks are a factor of a few too big to be consistent with the microlensing constraint .",
    "a smaller emission region might be achieved by decreasing the mass of the black hole ; however , once the accretion rate reaches eddington , the luminosity will be roughly fixed at the eddington rate . thus , if one assumes that the observed ( isotropic ) luminosity equals the eddington rate , then the black hole mass is about @xmath94 . using the magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) relation between black hole mass and bulge luminosity , the bulge luminosity is estimated to be about @xmath95 , with an uncertainty of about a factor of 10 .",
    "this is more than 150 times smaller than the near - ir luminosity , yet another indication that the infrared bump may not be due to a quiescent host galaxy .",
    "the observations presented here indicate the mid - infrared source size in the the einstein cross must be greater than @xmath49 cm , ruling out synchrotron emission .",
    "if true for other radio - quiet qsos , this implies that fits to the big blue bump which include a synchrotron power law may be flawed ( sun & malkan 1989 , laor 1990 ) .",
    "starburst and host galaxy contributions to the mid - infrared emission are ruled out based on the low radio flux , small size , and large infrared luminosity , leaving hot dust as the only viable model for the infrared emission in the einstein cross . to avoid sublimation",
    ", the dust must be at a distance of about 1 pc from the qso ; to explain the narrowness of the infrared bump it must be located within @xmath22 3pc ( according to a simple reprocessing model ) ; and to explain its strength , the dust must intercept about half of the qso continuum .",
    "since the mid - ir is extended , the flux ratios should be nearly equal to those of the galaxy gravitational lens model , so future models should be constructed with the infrared flux ratios as model constraints .",
    "improved microlensing statistics , magnifications , and time delays will result from better lens models .",
    "accurate monitoring of the einstein cross at mid - infrared wavelengths with , say , ngst , may reveal flux variations at the few % level , which would allow a better estimate of the size of the dust emission region .",
    "the einstein cross mid - infrared spectrum is quite different from any other qso ; it should be observed with sirtf to better constrain the dust emission model .",
    "data presented herein were obtained at the w.m .",

    "the observatory was made possible by the generous financial support of the w. m. keck foundation .",
    "this work was supported by nsf grants ast-9529230 and ast-9970827 and california space institute grant cs-16 - 93 .",

    "to correct for extinction in the lens galaxy , the correlation between @xmath96 color ( gunn bands ) and lens galaxy surface brightness found by racine ( 1991 ) was used .",
    "extrapolation to zero surface brightness then gives the color corrected for extinction in the lens galaxy , if one assumes that the dust column is proportional to surface brightness ( this assumption may be invalid if the dust is patchy ) . to solve for the absolute extinction",
