    "our understanding of planet formation has rapidly improved over the past 15 years .",
    "prior to the discovery of the first extrasolar planet orbiting a solar - type star ( 51 peg b ; @xcite ) , it was widely assumed that extrasolar giant planet semimajor axes would mimic those of the gas giants in our own solar system , which orbit at distances @xmath14 5 au . in the years that followed it became apparent that an _ in situ _ formation model was not universally applicable because radial velocity surveys were finding jovian planets in abundance well inside the canonical ice line .",
    "over 350 planets have now been discovered , 282 of which reside around stars within 200 pc .",
    "sufficiently large samples are available for the statistical properties of exoplanets to reveal themselves , providing information about the planet formation and migration processes . for solar - type stars ( f , g , and k dwarfs ) ,",
    "jovian planets fall into two rough populations : `` hot planets '' with @xmath15 @xmath1 0.1 au ( @xcite ) and those that orbit beyond @xmath0 1 au ( figure [ f1.eps ] ) .",
    "these observations were explained _ a posteriori _ in terms of orbital migration ( @xcite ) and planet - planet scattering ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , with the dearth of planets with periods between @xmath0 10 - 100 days ( the `` period valley '' ) possibly resulting from differential mass - dependent orbital migration ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "while much is known about planets around sun - like stars ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , comparatively little is known about planets around intermediate - mass ( i m ) stars with @xmath16 @xmath14 1.5 @xmath17 .",
    "main sequence a- and f - type stars are problematic doppler targets because of their high jitter levels and rotationally - broadened absorption features ( @xcite ) . on the other hand , evolved i m stars have lower jitter levels as well as narrower and more numerous absorption lines resulting from their slow rotation and cool photospheres . as a consequence , nearly all radial velocity surveys of i",
    "m stars are targeting evolved g- or k - type subgiants and giants ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ; @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , although at least one survey is targeting their main sequence progenitors ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "recently @xcite showed that planets orbiting evolved a - type stars have large semimajor axes compared to planets around solar - type stars .",
    "this trend has become even stronger with the discovery of more planets orbiting i m stars ( @xcite ) .",
    "specifically , over 20 planets have been discovered around stars with minimum masses @xmath14 1.5 @xmath18 but none have semimajor axes @xmath19 0.6 au .",

    "there are several explanations for this observational result .",
    "one possibility is that the swollen radii of evolved stars have engulfed or tidally disrupted short - period planets .",
    "the current census of i m exoplanet - host stars mostly consists of red clump giants ( core helium and hydrogen shell burning post - rgb stars ) and subgiants ( stars with contracting inert helium cores and hydrogen - burning shells ) .",
    "planet - hosting stars in the clump giant phase have radii between @xmath0 8 - 14 @xmath23 ( @xmath0 0.03 - 0.06 au ) so any planets orbiting inside @xmath0 0.1 au will likely have been engulfed by an expanding radius during post - main sequence stellar evolution .",
    "however , a tidal torque from an expanding stellar surface can also decay the orbits of short period planets . @xcite",
    "numerically trace the semimajor axis evolution of short - period planets around evolving rgb stars and show that , in their past , i m clump giants may have engulfed or disrupted the orbits of planets out to @xmath0 0.5 au .",
    "with radii between @xmath0 2 - 5 @xmath23 ( @xmath0 0.01 - 0.02 au ) , planets orbiting i m subgiants are the least affected by stellar evolution .",
    "stellar evolution may therefore explain the lack of short - period planets around i m clump giants , but the same result for i m subgiants suggests that the observed trend is not due to post - main sequence engulfment .",
    "the observed semimajor axis distribution can also be explained as a result of inward orbital migration combined with mass - dependent disk dispersal lifetime .",
    "the rocky progenitors of jovian planets ( @xmath010 @xmath24 cores ) can form at distances @xmath25 8 au for stellar masses between @xmath0 1.5 - 3 @xmath18 ( @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite performed monte carlo simulations of jovian planet formation and migration around i m stars and , using simple stellar mass - dependent gas disk lifetime relations ( @xcite ) and type ii migration models ( @xcite ) , was able to successfully reproduce the observed dearth of short - period planets .",
    "in this scenario inward migration is halted once rapid disk dispersal occurs , stranding migrating planets at semimajor axes that depend on stellar mass .",
    "an alternative explanation was offered by @xcite .",
    "they found that the protoplanetary disks of young i m stars will develop a maximum surface density at @xmath0 1 au as a result of magnetrotational instability of the inner disk , leading to a trapping and accumulation of solids that can then grow to form rocky cores and jovian planets .",
    "this formation scenario provides a mechanism for _ in situ _ formation of jovian planets interior to the ice line , which is located near 3 au at 10 myr for a 2 @xmath18 star ( @xcite ) .",
    "models of jovian planet formation around i m stars make few quantitative predictions that can be observationally tested . simple disk depletion plus migration models for i m planet hosts ( 1.5 - 3.0 @xmath18 ) by @xcite predict occurrence rates for jovian planets with semimajor axes @xmath19 0.5 au to be @xmath1 1.5% and for jovian planets with semimajor axes @xmath14 0.5 au to be @xmath25 7.5% .",
    "@xcite use a semianalytic model of protoplanetary disk evolution to study snow line locations and planet formation rates around stars of varying masses . for stellar masses between 1.5 - 2.0",
    "@xmath18 , their models predict that jovian planet occurrence rates reach frequencies of @xmath010 - 15% .",
    "@xcite suggest that multiple planetary systems may form more efficeintly around i m stars compared to other stellar mass regimes .",
    "the semimajor axis distribution of planets with minimum masses between @xmath0 2 - 10 @xmath4 orbiting i m stars is beginning to be better constrained by observations , but little is known about planets with masses @xmath19 1.5 @xmath4 .",
    "this poor understanding is a direct result of the dearth of low - mass planets currently known , with only one having a minimum mass below 1.5 @xmath4 ( hd 175541b with @xmath26sin@xmath27 = 0.70 @xmath4 ) .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether this scarcity is a result of a detection bias caused by higher jitter levels in i m stars or whether it reflects an intrinsic shortage of low - mass planets .",
    "unfortunately , models of planet formation in this stellar mass regime have made few predictions about low - mass planetary companions . for solar - type stars ,",
    "@xcite estimate the frequency of neptune - mass planets with periods @xmath19 50 days to be at least 30% .",
    "this raises the exciting possibility that low - mass planets could be abundant around i m stars , especially in light of recent studies suggesting that the frequency of jovian - mass planets scales with stellar mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "testing these theories requires an understanding of the detection limits of radial velocity surveys .",
    "the goal of this study is twofold : to derive the occurrence rate of jovian planets around i m stars and to characterize the distributions of planet periods ( @xmath10 ) and minimum masses ( @xmath26sin@xmath27 ) .",
    "in addition we take the opportunity to update the orbit solutions for known planet - hosting stars in our sample using new radial velocity measurements . to address the aforementioned questions we make use of a uniform sample of 31 i m subgiants taken from an ongoing radial velocity survey at lick observatory ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "our observations span @xmath0 5 years and sample semimajor axes out to several au , enabling detailed comparisons with previous surveys targeting solar - type stars .    in @xmath282",
    "we describe our radial velocity measurements and define our sample selection .",
    "updated keplerian orbits for five previously - known planetary systems are presented in @xmath283 and in @xmath284 we describe time - series photometric observations of these systems . in @xmath285",
    "we derive detection limits for stars in our sample .",
    "we discuss the frequency of jovian - mass planets in @xmath286 , and in @xmath287 we compare the mass - period distribution for solar - type stars to the results from our sample of i m subgiants .",
    "finally , we discuss the implications of our work in @xmath288 .",
    "our sample of subgiants is derived from a larger planet - hunting program at lick observatory targeting evolved stars ( the lick subgiant planet search : @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the original survey consists of 159 stars selected on the basis of @xmath29 @xmath30 colors and @xmath31 absolute magnitudes such that they lie one magnitude above the main sequence , have masses @xmath25 1.2 @xmath18 , and avoid red giant branch ( rgb ) , clump giant , and cepheid variable regions of the hr diagram .",
    "known spectroscopic and proper motion binaries within @xmath0 2@xmath32 are excluded . to obtain a more uniform population for this study we selected a sample of stars from the original survey based on the following criteria : 2 @xmath19 @xmath31 @xmath19 3 , 0.8 @xmath19 @xmath33 ",
    "@xmath34 @xmath19 1.0 , @xmath16 @xmath14 1.5 @xmath18 , and at least four radial velocity measurements ( the average number of measurements in our final sample is 26 ) .",
    "4 radial velocity measurements , but it is a previously - known spectroscopic binary . ]",
    "the magnitude cuts exclude clump giants and solar - mass subgiants , while the color cuts exclude rgb stars and yellow stragglers , the latter of which have high jitter levels and large binary frequencies .",
    "altogether our sample includes 31 intermediate - mass subgiants ( figure [ f2.eps ] ) .",
    "radial velocity measurements were obtained at lick observatory s 3 m shane telescope and 0.6 m coude auxiliary telescope with the hamilton spectrometer ( @xcite ; @xmath35 @xmath0 50,000 at @xmath36 = 5500  ) .",
    "doppler shifts are measured from each spectrum using the iodine cell method described in detail by @xcite and summarized as follows . a temperature - controlled pyrex cell containing gaseous iodine",
    "is placed at the entrance slit of the spectrometer .",
    "the dense set of narrow molecular lines imprinted on each stellar spectrum from 5000 to 6000   provides a robust wavelength scale for each observation , as well as information about the shape of the spectrometer s instrumental response ( @xcite ) .",
    "additional details about the observations can be found in @xcite .",
    "we derive keplerian orbital solutions for the five previously - known planets in our sample using ` rvlin ` , an efficient orbit - fitting routine written in idl and based on a partial linearization of kepler s equations ( @xcite ) .",
    "the radial velocity measurements were first combined into two - hour bins and the total measurement errors were estimated by adding 5 m s@xmath37 to the internal measurement errors , in quadrature , to account for the moderate jitter level of typical subgiants ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "we combine our observations of hd 167042 and 6 lyn ( hd 45410 ) with those made available by @xcite to create a larger data set for improved orbital phase coverage .",
    "the data sets were merged by simultaneously fitting for the constant offset between the two observatories .",
    "long - period companions will manifest as constant accelerations in the radial velocity measurements . to first order",
    "this drift can be modeled as a linear velocity trend for very long - period companions for which the period is much greater than the observing time baseline .",
    "when the slope has an amplitude comparable to the noise it is often difficult to determine whether a trend should be included in an orbit solution .",
    "the goodness of fit statistic ( typically the @xmath38 value ) might be reduced with the orbit - plus - trend solution , but , by that criterion for model selection , a more complicated model with multiple planets could be fit to a radial velocity set for which there is clearly insufficient evidence for additional companions . more generally ,",
    "how does one decide whether including more parameters in a model is justified ?",
    "fortunately this problem has received a great deal of attention in statistics and is the subject of bayesian model comparison .- test ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "we choose to follow a bayesian approach in this work . ]",
    "a commonly used model selection tool is the bayesian information criterion ( bic ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , which rewards better - fitting models but penalizes models that are overly complex :    @xmath39    where @xmath40 is the maximum likelihood for a particular model with @xmath41 free parameters and @xmath42 data points . in general the model with the smaller bic value",
    "is preferred .",
    "we use bic values for orbit solutions with and without a velocity trend to decide whether to include a linear slope in the model . the only planet - hosting star for which a trend produced a lower bic value was hd 167042 .",
    "we take this as evidence for a long - period companion in that system .",

    "for example , out of @xmath14 20 planets discovered around i m stars , none orbit at semimajor axes less than 0.6 au ( @xmath0 130 days for a 1.75 @xmath17 star ) and none have minimum masses below 0.70 @xmath4 ( see figure [ f1.eps ] and table [ evolvedtab ] ) .",
    "this has generally been attributed to a different mass - period distribution for planets around i m stars , but the influence of higher jitter levels on detection limits in surveys targeting i m stars is usually not taken into account and no quantitative analysis has yet been performed .",
    "we use a monte carlo method to rigorously test the null hypothesis that the mass - period distribution for planets around solar - type and i m stars is the same .",
    "the question we seek to answer is the following : given the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 for solar - type stars , a planet occurrence rate , and the detection limits for our sample of 28 stars , what is the probability of finding 7 or more planets all having masses greater than 1.5 @xmath4 and semimajor axes greater than 1 au ?",
    "value is small , so in this study we derive the probability of finding 7 _ or more _ planets with masses _ greater than _ 1.5 @xmath4 and semimajor axes _",
    "greater than _ 1 au . ]",
    "we first test whether we can reproduce the observed number and properties of planets in our sample using the same jovian planet frequency observed around solar - type stars . for each trial",
    "we randomly draw a new value of @xmath11 and @xmath12 from a gaussian distribution centered on the values from cumming et al . with a standard deviation equal to the quoted uncertainties . for each star in our sample",
    "we use the 10.5% planet frequency derived by cumming et al . to determine whether that particular star harbors a planet in our simulation .",
    "if a star harbors a planet , we randomly draw a mass and period for that planet from the power law distribution in equation [ eqn : mp ] .",
    "finally , we check to see whether that planet would have been detected around that star based on the star s detection limits .",
    "we repeat this process @xmath100 times , saving the results after each trial .",
    "the results of our first monte carlo simulation are shown in the left panels of figure [ f14.eps ] . out of @xmath100 trials , 24 produced 7 or more planets with any mass or semimajor axis , yielding a probability of 0.024% ( figure [ f14.eps ] : top left ) .",
    "from the same simulation , however , no trials produced 7 or more planets _ with masses above 1.5 @xmath4 and semimajor axes greater than 1 au _ , yielding a probability of less than 10@xmath101 ( figure [ f14.eps ] : bottom left ) .",
    "the input model values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 and/or the input planet frequency are therefore inconsistent with the number and properties of planets we observed in our sample of intermediate - mass stars .    to determine whether increasing the planet frequency changes the results , we perform a similar monte carlo simulation except instead of the 10.5% occurrence rate we randomly draw a new planet frequency for each trial following the binomial distribution for 7 detections out of a sample of 28 ( yielding a median planet frequency of @xmath0 26% ) .",
    "for this exercise , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the same as the cumming et al . values , but the probability of a star hosting a planet changes for each trial",
    ". the results of this simulation are presented in the right - hand panels of figure [ f14.eps ] .",
    "the probability of detecting 7 or more planets with any mass and semimajor axis rose to 6.3% , but the probability of detecting 7 or more planets with masses above 1.5 @xmath4 and semimajor axes larger than 1 au is 0.002% .",
    "even when accounting for the different planet occurrence rates , we can rule out the sun - like mass - period distribution for planets around i m stars at a confidence level of over 4 @xmath13 .",
    "these simulations can easily be extended to exclude a wider range of @xmath11 and @xmath12 parameter space with varying degrees of confidence .",
    "we do this by running the same monte carlo simulation drawing from a binomial planet frequency distribution ( with 7 detections out of 28 stars ) over the following ranges of exponents : 2 @xmath19 @xmath11 @xmath19 8 ( @xmath102 = 0.5 ) and 2 @xmath19 @xmath12 @xmath19 8 ( @xmath103 = 0.5 ) . for each @xmath11-@xmath12 pair",
    "we run @xmath104 trials .",
    "the results are displayed in figure [ f15.eps ] ; each value of the grid represents the probability of detecting 7 or more planets with masses above 1.5 @xmath4 and semimajor axes greater than 1 au .",
    "this technique allows us to exclude large regions of @xmath11-@xmath12 space as being inconsistent with our observations .",
    "negative values and small positive values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are rejected with high confidence levels , while larger values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are able to reproduce the observed properties more often .",
    "qualitatively this makes sense : we did not detect any low - mass ( small @xmath11 ) or short - period ( small @xmath12 ) planets .",
    "we note that the inclusion of detection limits is critical in our analysis as it allows us to `` detect '' or ",
    "miss  simulated planets based on whether they fall above or below our detection threshold .",
    "little is known about the saturn- or neptune - mass population of planets around i m stars .",
    "most planets orbiting i m stars discovered to date have masses @xmath25 2 @xmath4 ( table [ evolvedtab ] ) , leading to suggestions that more massive stars tend to produce more massive planets ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is unclear , however , whether this is a _ bona fide _ property or a result of an observational bias caused by higher jitter levels in i m stars which might mask the signals of lower - mass planets .",
    "moreover , few authors have assessed the limiting planet masses attainable by doppler surveys of evolved i m stars . despite the dearth of jovian planets at small semimajor axes , could a population of saturn - mass planets exist interior to 1 au around i m stars ? would the higher jitter levels of evolved i m stars prevent the discovery of neptune - mass planets ?",
    "we address these questions in this study by deriving detection limits for our sample of 31 i m ( 1.5 @xmath19 @xmath2 @xmath19 2.0 ) subgiants .",
    "typical detection limits for our stellar sample include planet masses down to @xmath0 \\{0.21 , 0.34 , 0.50 , 0.64 , 1.3 } @xmath4 within \\{0.1 , 0.3 , 0.6 , 1.0 , 3.0 } au at the 95.4% confidence level , excluding targets with large radial velocity scatter .",
    "we can therefore rule out the existence of hot saturns within 0.1 au and jovian planets out to 1 au for most stars in our sample .",
    "these detection limits suggest that the notably high masses of planets from our sample ( @xmath25 2 @xmath4 ) compared to planet masses around solar - type stars may be caused by a real difference in planet population characteristics .",
    "for example , if a population of planets with random masses existed at 1 au then we would expect an observational bias to result in an observed mass distribution that was truncated near the typical mass detection limit . as jovian planets would have been detected out to @xmath0 1 au , the higher planet masses uncovered so far may be indicative of a real trend .",
    "we test this idea quantitatively by comparing the mass - period distribution of planets around sun - like stars to the observed number and properties of planets in our sample . even when correcting for the higher planet occurrence rate found in our sample , the values of @xmath11 and @xmath12 in equation [ eqn : mp ] fail to reproduce the number ( 7/28 ) , masses ( @xmath14 1.5 @xmath4 ) , and semimajor axes ( @xmath14 1 au ) of planets from our sample at a confidence level of @xmath14 4 @xmath13 .",
    "we conclude that the frequency and mass - period distribution of planets around i m stars is different from those around solar - type stars . increasing the mass of the host star by a mere factor of 1.5 - 2 results in an entirely new planet population which is characterized by a high frequency ( @xmath0 26% ) of high - mass planets ( @xmath26sin@xmath27 @xmath14 1.5 @xmath4 ) at large semimajor axes ( @xmath15 @xmath14 1 au ) .",
    "the detection limits of the residuals of the planet - hosting stars in our sample show the strength of subgiant jitter levels and therefore trace the sensitivity levels attainable to doppler surveys targeting subgiants .",
    "the residual rms velocities range from @xmath06 - 10 m s@xmath37 .",
    "the detection limits indicate that planetary companions with minimum masses above \\{0.2 , 0.4 , 0.5 , 0.7 , 1.4 } @xmath4 within \\{0.1 , 0.3 , 0.6 , 1.0 , 3.0 } au can not exist in these systems .",
    "if these detection limits are representative of the typical jitter levels of subgiants then the higher rms velocity values observed in other subgiants from our sample may suggest as - yet - unrecognized low - mass companions .",
    "given our jitter - dominated detection limits , the prospects of discovering neptune - mass planets ( @xmath0 0.053 @xmath4 ) in circular orbits around i m stars using the doppler technique is not encouraging .",
    "if the dominant source of jitter in subgiants is from @xmath92-mode oscillations , observing strategies that include longer integration times or repeated exposures over hour - long timescales may help to partially overcome this hurtle ( see @xcite ) .",
    "our ongoing survey of intermediate - mass subgiants at keck observatory will address this issue by using the high rv precision achievable with the hires spectrometer and larger telescope aperture of keck compared to the lick 3 m .",
    "we derive updated orbit solutions using new observations for five of the known planet - hosting i m subgiants in our sample , which were originally announced by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "our results are in excellent agreement with those previously reported in the literature .",
    "our parameter uncertainties are typically a factor of @xmath0 2 smaller than the published values as a result of longer baselines and more radial velocity measurements .",
    "we also note that there is no evidence for periodicity in the residuals of the previously - known planet - hosting stars .",
    "we acquired time - series photometric observations of the five known planet - hosting stars with the automatic photometric telescopes at fairborn observatory .",
    "we find no evidence for brightness variation levels in any of the five stars that could call the existence of their planetary companions into question .",
    "the eccentricities of three of the five planets in our sample with accurate orbital solutions are consistent with zero and emphasize a low - eccentricity trend for planets around i m subgiants , all but two of which have eccentricities below 0.3 ( table [ evolvedtab ] ) .",
    "this is in contrast to planets around solar - type stars , which have approximately uniform eccentricity distributions between 0.0 and 0.8 for semimajor axes @xmath25 0.3 au ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "interestingly , @xcite find that the eccentricity distributions for planets with masses @xmath19 1 @xmath4 peaks at @xmath44 @xmath19 0.2 , while the planets with masses @xmath14 1 @xmath4 have more uniformly distributed eccentricities between 0.0 @xmath19 @xmath44 @xmath19 0.6 .",
    "planets around i m stars show the opposite trend : high - mass planets tend to have circular orbits .",
    "we will explore this effect in detail in a future publication in this series .",
    "information about planets orbiting i m stars has been driven by observations rather than theory . there is a growing need for stellar mass - dependent theoretical models of planet formation that make testable predictions about the physical and orbital characteristics of planets in this stellar mass regime .",
    "specifically , the abundance of low - mass planets , the eccentricity distribution , and the fraction of multiple planetary systems are but a few of the many outstanding questions to be addressed in this young field .",
    "we also encourage high - contrast imaging campaigns to include more a - type stars in their surveys .",
    "five planets have already been directly imaged orbiting a stars : hr 8799 b , c , and d ( @xcite ) , formalhaut b ( @xcite ) , and @xmath12 pic b ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , @xcite made their discovery after observing only a few early - type stars , in contrast to the many hundreds of late - type stars that have yielded null detections .",
    "these results , combined with the higher inner planet occurrence rate we measure , suggest that more planet - hunting imaging surveys in this mass regime will yield fruitful results .",
    "we extend our gratitude to the many cat observers who have helped with this project over the years , including chris mccarthy , raj sareen , howard isaacson , joshua goldston , bernie walp , julia kregenow , jason wright , and shannon patel .",
