    "the origin of the isotropic diffuse emission ( sreekumar et al .",
    "1998 ) in energies between @xmath0 and @xmath1 , detected by the _",
    "energetic gamma - ray experiment telescope _ ( egret ) aboard the _ compton gamma - ray observatory _",
    ", remains one of the great unknowns of gev - energy astrophysics .",
    "there are two major questions that still remain unanswered",
    "how much of the diffuse emission detected by egret is , in fact , extragalactic , and what is the spectrum of this extragalactic background ? and 2 .",
    "what fraction of the extragalactic emission can be attributed to each of the observationally established classes of gamma - ray emitters ? despite the associated uncertainties , these two issues are critical in any attempt to use gamma - ray observations to constrain exotic high - energy physics and yet - undetected classes of theorized gamma - ray emitters .    to answer the first question , a good understanding of the galactic diffuse emission in the egret energy range is required . in order to obtain the intensity and spectrum of the extragalactic emission from the egret sky maps , the galactic emission needs to be modeled and subtracted .",
    "this is made complicated by the discrepancy between the observed milky way spectrum in energies of @xmath2 and theoretical expectations ( hunter et al .",
    "the observed spectrum is more shallow than model predictions based on the local demodulated cosmic ray spectrum .",
    "this deviation is known as the `` gev excess '' , and although various explanations have been proposed to account for part or all of the discrepancy , its origin remains a matter of debate ( e.g. , pohl et al .",
    "1997 ; bsching et al .  2001 ; strong et al .  2004b ; kamae et al .  2005 ; de boer et al .  2006",
    "; strong 2006 ; stecker et al .  2007 ) . as a result",
    ", determinations of the gamma - ray background using different galactic emission models yield very different answers , both in intensity and in spectrum , despite being based on the same set of observations ( e.g. , sreekumar et al .  1998 ; strong et al .",
    "2004a ) .",
    "attempts to answer the second question have been plagued by uncertainties in the cosmic density and evolution of the two established classes of extragalactic gamma - ray emitters : normal galaxies and blazars .",
    "our observational knowledge of the gamma - ray properties of normal galaxies is very limited , as the sample of normal galaxies which have been observed in gamma rays consists of only the milky way and a marginal detection of the large magellanic cloud ( sreekumar et al .",
    "1992 ; hunter et al .",
    "1997 ; hartman et al .",
    "for this reason , the accuracy of theoretical estimates of the contribution of normal galaxies to the gamma - ray background is unavoidably at the order - of - magnitude level ( e.g. , lichti et al .",
    "1978 ; pavlidou & fields 2002 ) .",
    "but even in the case of blazars , which are by far the most numerous and best studied class of identified gamma - ray emitters , estimates of their contribution to the gamma - ray background vary from a few percent to @xmath3 of the background originally reported by the egret team ( e.g. , padovani et al .",
    "1993 ; stecker & salamon 1996a ; kazanas & perlman 1997 ; mukherjee & chiang 1999 ; mcke & pohl 2000 ; narumoto & totani 2006 ; dermer 2007 ) .",
    "the issue is further complicated by the existence of 171 sources which , at the time of publication of the 3rd egret catalog ( hereafter 3eg ; hartman et al .",
    "1999 ) , had not been positively or potentially associated with a lower - energy counterpart .",
    "these sources are collectively known as the unidentified egret sources , and they are more numerous than any established group of gamma - ray emitters .",
    "the distribution of these sources on the sky is such that a galactic feature can be clearly distinguished - however a large number of sources are located away from the galactic plane and the galactic center .",
    "no more than a handful of sources can be associated with the milky way halo if the milky way is not many times brighter in gamma - rays than similar galaxies such as m31 ( siegal - gaskins et al .",
    "hence , it is almost certain that the egret unidentified sources include a significant extragalactic component .",
    "although the nature of these extragalactic sources remains unknown , it is reasonable to believe that there is a large number of fainter , unresolved objects of the same class , which are guaranteed to have _ some _ contribution to the extragalactic gamma - ray background ( egrb ) .",
    "if these sources represent yet unidentified members of some known class of gamma - ray emitters ( e.g.  blazars ) , then excluding them from any calculation of the contribution of the parent class to the diffuse background would lead to a significantly underestimated result due to an incorrect normalization of the bright - end of the gamma - ray luminosity function .",
    "if they represent an unknown class of gamma - ray emitters , then the contribution of their unresolved counterparts to the diffuse emission would significantly limit the diffuse flux left to be attributed to known classes , exotic processes , and truly diffuse emission .",
    "hence , some contribution of unresolved unidentified sources to the egrb is certain .",
    "it is therefore clear that until we either answer the question of the nature of unidentified sources or derive some strong constraint indicating that a possible contribution of such unresolved objects to the egrb would indeed be minor , we can not hope to fully understand the origin of the egrb .",
    "detailed predictions for the level of the unidentified source contribution to the egrb involve important uncertainties : since no low - energy counterparts have been identified , we have no estimates of distance , and therefore no estimates of the gamma - ray luminosities of these sources . as a result",
    ", very few constraints can be placed on their cosmic distribution and evolution .",
    "however , very simple estimates can offer some guidance on whether ignoring this egrb component may be a safe assumption to make .",
    "for example , we can use the number of unidentified sources , the minimum flux resolvable by egret , and the observed intensity to the extragalactic gamma - ray background to place rough limits on the distance scales associated with resolved and unresolved unidentified sources so that unresolved sources do not overproduce the background .",
    "a population of unbeamed , non - evolving , single - luminosity sources uniformly distributed in euclidian space are resolvable out to a distance @xmath4 by an instrument of number flux sensitivity @xmath5 .",
    "the relation between @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and number luminosity @xmath6 in this case is simply @xmath7 .",
    "if the instrument detects @xmath8 such sources , their number density @xmath9 can be estimated to be @xmath10 .",
    "if the same distribution of sources continues out to a distance @xmath11 , the isotropic intensity ( photons per unit area per unit time per unit solid angle ) from the _ unresolved _ members of this population will be @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the contribution from sources within a spherical shell located at a distance @xmath14 from the observer .",
    "substituting our results for @xmath9 and @xmath6 above , and performing the integral , we obtain @xmath15 if we require that the unresolved emission from this population does not exceed the egrb observed by egret ( @xmath16 ) , we obtain @xmath17 . substituting @xmath18 for the population of extragalactic unidentified sources",
    "( see discussion in  [ samples ] ) , @xmath19 for the sensitivity of egret , and @xmath20 ( sreekumar et al . 1998 ) , we obtain @xmath21 .",
    "this result implies that the largest distance out to which such a distribution of objects persists can not be larger than a few times the distance out to which these objects are currently resolved , since in any other case these sources would overproduce the egrb .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that the unidentified source contribution to the egrb is significant , if not dominant .    in this work ,",
    "we approach the problem from a purely empirical point of view . instead of attempting to _ predict _ the level of a diffuse component due to unresolved objects of the same class as unidentified egret sources , we try to assess whether there are any empirical indications that this component is , in fact , minor .",
    "we construct samples of unidentified sources which , based on their sky distribution , are likely to consist mostly of extragalactic objects . under the assumption that the majority of these sources can be treated as members of a single class of gamma - ray emitters ,",
    "we seek to answer the following three questions :    \\(1 ) is it likely that unresolved objects of the same class could have a significant contribution to the egrb at least in some energy range ?",
    "\\(2 ) how would the collective spectrum of their emission compare to the measured spectrum of the egrb deduced from egret observations ?",
    "\\(3 ) how are glast observations expected to improve our understanding of the nature of unidentified sources , based on the insight gained from our analysis ?",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in ",
    "[ samples ] we discuss the samples of resolved unidentified sources used in our analysis .",
    "our formalism for constructing the collective emission spectrum of unresolved unidentified sources is presented in  [ formalism ] .",
    "inputs from egret data used in our analysis are described in  [ inputs ] . in  [ results ] we describe our results , and in  [ sec : glast ] we discuss how these results are expected to improve once glast observations become available .",
    "finally , we summarize our conclusions in  [ sec : disc ] .",
    "the observational input constraining our calculations will be the fluxes of the unidentified sources and the spectral index of each source .",
    "the fluxes we use for our analysis are the p1234 photon fluxes quoted in 3eg .",
    "these fluxes were determined from the combined maps from all viewing periods during which any particular object was within the egret field of view .",
    "the spectral index @xmath22 of each object is also taken from 3eg , and was derived through a fit assuming that the photon flux of each object obeys @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the photon energy .",
    "we seek to constrain a possible contribution to the egrb from objects of the same class as unidentified sources .",
    "for this reason , we would like to base our calculations on a _ resolved _ source sample which is as representative as possible of the population of _ extragalactic _ unidentified egret sources .",
    "however , the population of sources which , at the time of publication of 3eg , did not have confident associations with known astrophysical objects , clearly exhibits a galactic feature , with many of the sources concentrated around the galactic plane and at small galactic longitudes ( close to the galactic center ) .",
    "thus , the original population of egret unidentified sources is not an appropriate sample as it includes many sources which are most likely galactic .",
    "since these sources are unidentified , there is no counterpart information which could be used to distinguish between galactic and extragalactic objects .",
    "additionally , inferences based on their spectral indices and variability are also very hard to make due to the large error bars associated with measurements of these quantities ( see siegal - gaskins et al .  2007 ) .",
    "finally , both galactic and extragalactic identified objects exhibit a large range of luminosities , so that inferences about the location of unidentified sources based on their fluxes are not possible either .",
    "the only relatively robust indication concerning the location of these sources is their position on the sky . a galactic population associated with the disk and bulge",
    "will most likely be concentrated around low galactic latitudes and small galactic longitudes . on the other hand , a halo population , which may appear more uniformly distributed on the sky ,",
    "can not have too many members among the resolved egret unidentified sources , based on the gamma - ray properties of galaxies similar to the milky way ( siegal - gaskins et al .",
    "thus , excluding objects around the galactic plane and the galactic center will most likely minimize any galactic contamination of the sample of unidentified sources .",
    "for this reason , we have excluded from our studies all sources with galactic latitude @xmath25 for galactic longitudes @xmath26 and galactic latitude @xmath27 for galactic longitudes @xmath28 .",
    "the source exclusion map we have applied is plotted in fig .",
    "[ mask ] , and is identical to the mask applied by sreekumar et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in their selection of egret diffuse emission data to use for the derivation of the egrb .",
    "the solid angle associated with this mask is @xmath29 , leaving @xmath30 of allowed solid angle .",
    "for this reason , and under the assumption that an extragalactic population will be uniformly distributed on the sky , we have renormalized all derived flux distributions by a factor of @xmath31 .",
    "additionally , we have excluded from all samples objects j0516 + 2320 , j0852 - 1216 , j1424 + 3734 , and j2241 - 6736 because no p1234 flux was quoted for them in 3eg , and objects j0824 - 4610 , j0827 - 4247 , j0828 - 4954 , j0841 - 4356 , j0848 - 4429 , and j0859 - 4257 because they were marked as possible or likely artifacts in 3eg .",
    "we have applied further selection criteria which result in three distinct samples of resolved unidentified sources .",
    "the use of different samples will allow us to test the sensitivity of our results to the details of the included members .",
    "sample 1 includes all sources which were unidentified at the time 3eg was published _ and",
    "_ all sources which were characterized as `` possible blazars '' ( identification code `` a '' in 3eg ) .",
    "these latter objects are routinely not included in studies of the blazar luminosity function , so it is reasonable to examine the potential contribution of this class to the egrb by including it in our analysis .",
    "sample 1 includes 84 sources .",
    "sample 2 only includes sources which were unidentified at the time 3eg was published . in this case , we do not consider `` possible blazars '' to belong to this sample .",
    "sample 2 includes 63 sources , and is a subset of sample 1 .",
    "sample 3 is the most conservative of our samples , in that it contains the smallest number of objects . in this case , not only have we excluded all `` probable blazars '' , but also any object for which even a tentative or potential identification has been suggested since the publication of 3eg .",
    "sample 3 includes 53 sources , and is a subset of sample 2 .",
    "sources which are present in sample 2 but not in sample 3 are the following : j0010 + 7309 , j0724 - 4713 , j1212 + 2304 , j1825 + 2854 , j1835 + 5918 , j0329 + 2149 , j0725 - 5140 , j1249 - 8330 , j1621 + 8203 , and j1959 + 6342 .",
    "the locations of all the sources in our samples are shown in fig .",
    "a quantity which , under the assumption of isotropy , fully describes the egrb is the differential photon intensity @xmath32 ( photons per unit area - time - energy - solid angle ) . in this section ,",
    "we calculate @xmath32 for a population of unresolved sources .",
    "we make the following assumptions for the population of unresolved gamma - ray sources we consider .    1 .",
    "each of the sources has an energy spectrum which , in the egret and glast energy ranges , can be well described as a single power law of spectral index @xmath22 , and a total photon flux @xmath33 at energies @xmath34 ( where @xmath33 is the photon flux in units of @xmath35 ) .",
    "2 .   the cumulative flux distribution , @xmath36 ( number of sources with flux greater than @xmath33 versus @xmath33 ) , of this population can be adequately described , between fluxes @xmath37 and @xmath38 , as a power law , @xmath39 3 .",
    "the probability distribution of spectral indices of the population @xmath40 is independent of source luminosity and does not evolve with redshift .",

    "each unresolved source with a flux @xmath33 at energies @xmath44 , has a contribution @xmath45 to the diffuse emission which is given by @xmath46 where @xmath22 is the spectral index of the source , and @xmath47 in the case of 3eg fluxes .",
    "the @xmath48 normalization factor comes from assuming an isotropic distribution of sources , the collective emission of which is uniformly distributed over the celestial sphere .",
    "the differential flux distribution of the population is @xmath49    the collective diffuse emission due to this population of unresolved sources with fluxes between @xmath50 and @xmath51 will be : @xmath52_{f_{\\rm 8 , min}}^{f_{\\rm 8 , max } } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\times \\int_{\\alpha = -\\infty}^{\\infty } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\!d\\alpha \\ , p(\\alpha ) \\left(\\frac{e}{e_0}\\right)^{-\\alpha } \\!\\!\\!\\!\\!\\ !",

    "( [ fit1 ] ) for the cumulative flux distribution breaks down .",
    "the features of the spectral shape of this emission in the simple case when @xmath40 is a gaussian are discussed in appendix [ shape ] .",
    "equation ( [ contr ] ) can provide a first simple estimate for the possible contribution of unresolved sources of the same class as extragalactic unidentified egret sources to the isotropic diffuse gamma - ray background .",
    "the required inputs are the cumulative flux function of eq .",
    "( [ fit1 ] ) , and the spectral index distribution of the source class , @xmath40 . in this section ,",
    "we derive these inputs from the three source samples discussed in  [ samples ] .",
    "possible source variability has not been accounted for in this analysis .",
    "a discussion of possible effects of source variability , as well as our reasoning for not considering them for the purposes of our study , are presented in appendix [ var ] .",
    "we use data from the resolved objects in our three samples to construct the cumulative flux distribution of egret unidentified sources .",
    "the cumulative flux distributions of the three samples are shown in fig .",
    "( [ lognlogs ] ) . due to non - uniformities in egret exposure ,",
    "the lowest resolvable flux is not a hard - set number , but rather the efficiency in resolving low - flux objects decreases gradually as the flux decreases , which is one of the major factors in the slow turnover of the cumulative distribution function .",
    "for this reason , we only use data within the range @xmath55 to obtain a fit to the cumulative flux distribution .",
    "we take @xmath56 , and assume that all sources with fluxes above this limit have been resolved by egret .",
    "we define @xmath57 to be the flux for which , in each sample , 5 objects with fluxes higher than or equal to it have been resolved .",
    "the best - fit values of @xmath58 and @xmath59 for each sample are shown in table  [ sometable ] . as we can see in fig .",
    "( [ lognlogs ] ) as well as from the parameter values in table [ sometable ] , the slopes of the cumulative flux distribution in the regime where most objects are expected to have been resolved by egret are fully consistent with each other .",
    "this in turn implies that the data are consistent with the hypothesis that most members of all samples have been drawn from a single population of extragalactic emitters .    however , we note that the flux distribution slope , close to @xmath602.5 in all cases , is steeper than the slope that would be expected from a single - luminosity population of sources with a uniform distribution in a flat cosmology ( which is equal to @xmath61 , e.g.  dermer 2007 ) , and is also steeper than the slope of the flux distribution of the confidently identified blazar population",
    ". this result may reflect the cosmological distribution and evolution properties of the population of extragalactic unidentified sources .",
    "however , it may also originate in a selection effect in the identification of gamma - ray sources : the positional identification of brighter sources is more frequent as more photons are detected from these sources which allows for a more accurate pinpointing of their location .",
    "in addition , multiwavelength campaigns for the identification of gamma - ray sources naturally target the brightest objects first . for these reasons , the high - flux end of the flux distribution",
    "may be preferentially depleted , which would lead to an apparent steepening of the distribution of the sources that remain unidentified .",
    "finally , the steepness of the slope could be an effect of viewing a distribution with real curvature in a very small dynamical range in flux .",
    "a simple example quantifying such a possible effect is the following : if we were to treat all sources in sample 1 and all confidently identified blazars which are located outside our exclusion mask as a single population , then the cumulative flux distribution power - law fit in the flux range @xmath62 would have a slope @xmath63 , much closer to @xmath61 .",
    "finally , we should add a cautionary note on fits to the cumulative , rather than differential , flux distribution function , such as the one presented here .",
    "our fits purposfully do not account for uncertainties in each bin since , from a statistical point of view , such uncertainties are almost perfectly correlated ( each bin contains the same data as its adjacent ones plus / minus one data point ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the poor dynamical range in flux and the dependence of uncertainties of the _ differential _ flux function on the size of the bin make constructing and fitting the differential flux function problematic as well . for these reasons , it is important to not over - interpret these results , which should be viewed as broad , order - of - magnitude assessments of the behavior of the flux distribution , rather than robust statistical evaluations and strict constraints .",
    "the second important observational input in our calculation is the distribution of spectral indices of unidentified objects @xmath40 . in the limit that the spectral index of sources is independent of source redshift and luminosity",
    ", the spectral index distribution uniquely determines the spectral shape of the collective emission from the unresolved population .",
    "the spectral shape of the unresolved emission provides , in turn , an additional tool to assess the possibility that unidentified sources constitute a dominant contribution to the egrb through _ shape comparison _ between the observed and the predicted spectra of diffuse extragalactic emission .    in our analysis",
    "we adopt the assumption that the spectral index distribution of unresolved unidentified sources is the same as that of the resolved unidentified sources .",
    "the latter can be deduced from measurements of the spectral index @xmath22 for sources in each one of our samples , following the method presented in venters & pavlidou ( 2007 ) .",
    "the details of this calculation , properly accounting for measurement uncertainties in individual spectral indices of resolved sources , are presented in appendix [ spindex ] .",
    ".fit parameters of the cumulative flux distribution [ sometable ] [ cols=\"<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "certain classes of sources contributing to the gamma - ray background may exhibit significant time variability ( blazars are a prominent example of such sources ) .",
    "this fact has generated some concern that the objects resolved by egret ( especially the fainter ones ) are preferentially objects that happened to be in their flaring state when observed , and hence the luminosity function as determined by the resolved objects is not an adequate description of all the unresolved sources contributing to the gamma - ray background .",
    "stecker & salamon ( 1996a ) have addressed that uncertainty in the case of blazars using an explicit treatment of source variability .",
    "this concern is less pronounced if the fluxes used for normalizing the luminosity function of a class of sources are averaged over exposure times reasonably large compared to the source duty cycle . to minimize the possible impact of variability",
    ", we use in this study the p1234 fluxes quoted in 3eg .",
    "sources which have been detected in individual viewing periods but which have no p1234 flux ( which implies that their detection significance in the cumulative map was not high enough ) are omitted from our analysis .",
    "we have not made any further attempt to treat variability in this work , because the unknown parameters in the variability properties of sources are severe enough that any simple treatment of variability is likely to introduce at least as much uncertainty as it attempts to remove , while any uncertainty in the flux distribution of the source samples due to source variability is minor compared to the uncertainties introduced due to our ignorance concerning the nature of unidentified sources .",
