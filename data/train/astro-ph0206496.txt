    "2000 ) , and type ia supernovae indicate cosmic acceleration ( e.g. , riess et al .  1998 ;",
    "perlmutter et al .  1999 ) .",
    "the popular cosmology has matter content @xmath20.35 and dark energy @xmath30.70 such that @xmath4 . for simplicity",
    "i assume that the dark energy corresponds to a cosmological constant @xmath5 , although my analysis could easily be extended to quintessence models ( e.g. , waga & miceli 1999 ) .",
    "one phenomenon that has traditionally stood out from the concordance model is strong gravitational lensing .",
    "the statistics of strong lenses are sensitive to the cosmological parameters via the cosmological volume element ( e.g. , turner 1990 ; fukugita , futamase & kasai 1990 ) , and analyses of the data have yielded upper limits on the dark energy at the level of @xmath6 at 95% confidence ( e.g. , kochanek 1996 ; falco , kochanek & muoz 1998 ) .",
    "there are small systematic uncertainties in the upper limit due to assumptions about the lens sample and the amount of dust extinction in lens galaxies ( e.g. , falco et al .  1998 ; helbig et al .  1999 ; waga & miceli 1999 ; cooray , quashnock & miller 1999 ) .",
    "larger systematic effects arise from uncertainties in the local luminosity function of galaxies .",
    "chiba & yoshii ( 1999 ) argue that by adopting luminosity functions from different surveys they can relax the upper limit on @xmath0 and even find models that favor values in the range @xmath70.8 .",
    "kochanek et al .",
    "( 1998 ) respond by acknowledging the systematic uncertainties but defending their choice of luminosity function as the one that is most consistent with the observed luminosities of lens galaxies .",
    "this controversy will soon be resolved by new measurements of the luminosity function from the sdss and 2df surveys that appear to eliminate most of the traditional problems ( blanton et al .",
    "2001 ; cross et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "while debating the details , the previous studies agreed on the idea that raising @xmath0 dramatically increases the expected number of lenses ; they agreed on the trend and only contested the zero point . in this _",
    "i question the trend itself , based on number counts of distant galaxies .",
    "i argue that the lens statistics models used to obtain upper limits on @xmath0 are inconsistent with galaxy counts at @xmath1  not with any particular value of the counts , but with the general idea that they can be measured and used as constraints on the models .",
    "i modify the models to be calibrated by galaxy counts and consider how the new models depend on @xmath0 .",
    "for simplicity i consider only flat cosmologies .",
    "the optical depth for lensing of sources at redshift @xmath8 is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mass function of deflectors , @xmath11 is the cross section for lensing by a deflector of mass @xmath12 at redshift @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the comoving distance . when analyzing real lens data the optical depth must be modified to account for magnification bias , or the fact that lensing magnification effectively changes a survey s flux limit ( e.g. , turner , ostriker & gott 1984 ) .",
    "magnification bias is largely insensitive to cosmological parameters , so for our purposes the simple optical depth is adequate .",
    "nearly all arcsecond - scale lenses are produced by detectable galaxies , so many analyses of lens statistics model the deflector population with observed galaxy populations .",
    "the luminosity function of galaxies is often parameterized as a schechter function with the form @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a characteristic luminosity , @xmath17 is a characteristic comoving number density , and @xmath18 is the power law slope at the faint end .",
    "luminosity must be converted to mass for the lensing analyses , and this is usually done with the empirical faber ",
    "jackson relation @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the velocity dispersion .",
    "luminosity naturally changes with redshift due to passive evolution : stellar populations fade with time as stars die out .",
    "the number density may change with time due to mergers .",
    "the number evolution can be parameterized in various ways , but lin et al.(1999 ) propose the form @xmath21 so that the number evolution parameter @xmath22 can be combined with another parameter representing luminosity evolution expressed in observers units of magnitudes .",
    "i adopt this form since the exact parameterization is not very important for my analysis .",
    "other than luminosity and number evolution , we may assume for simplicity that @xmath18 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 are all independent of redshift ( see lin et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "lens galaxies are usually approximated as isothermal spheres , which is consistent with lens data , galaxy dynamics , and x - ray ellipticals ( e.g. , fabbiano 1989 ; rix et al .",
    "1997 ; treu & koopmans 2002 ) .",
    "the lensing optical depth can then be written as ( e.g. , kochanek 1993 ) @xmath25 ^ 2      \\frac { n_*(z_l ) } { n_*(0 ) } \\ , , \\label{eq : tau1a } \\\\",

    "if there is no number evolution ( @xmath30 ) , then eq .  ( [ eq : tau1a ] ) yields the standard result for the lensing optical depth ( e.g. , kochanek 1993 ) , @xmath31 where the optical depth is proportional to the cosmological volume @xmath32 and hence very sensitive to @xmath0 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tau1 ] . if we allow for some number evolution but assume that @xmath33 is identical for all cosmologies ( as done by jain et al .",
    "2000 ) , the optical depth curves shift slightly but retain the same qualitative behavior . in other words , if we assume the same number density ( whether constant or not ) for all cosmologies then we recover the standard result that the number of lenses increases significantly as @xmath0 increases , with little sensitivity to the actual amount of number evolution .",
    "the increase is large enough that previous analyses of lens statistics were able to obtain interesting upper limits on @xmath0 even from small lens samples .",
    "although the focus of the models is the lensing optical depth , a corollary prediction is the number of galaxies per unit redshift per unit area on the sky , @xmath34 fig .",
    "[ fig : counts1 ] shows the predicted number counts for the models from fig .",
    "[ fig : tau1 ] .",
    "if @xmath33 is the same in all cosmologies then number counts of galaxies at moderate or high redshifts are very sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "for example , at @xmath35 models with @xmath36 and 0.7 differ by a factor of two .",
    "this is the basis of the classic idea to use galaxy number counts to constrain the cosmology ( see sandage 1997 ; driver 2002 ) .",
    "lens statistics boil down in some sense to galaxy counts , where the objects being counted are lens galaxies ( mostly massive ellipticals at @xmath371 ) .",
    "galaxy counts at moderate redshifts ( @xmath11 ) can now be measured directly ( e.g. , lin et al .",
    "1999 ; davis et al .  2001 ; eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) , so we can imagine using them to test the models .",
    "let us consider not any particular value for the counts , but just the general idea that they can be measured . if the counts at @xmath11 are measured then at most one of the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts1 ] can be correct .",
    "what happens if instead we insist that all models agree with some observed galaxy counts @xmath38 ? in an idealized situation where number counts could be measured well at all redshifts , the optical depth would be @xmath39 in other words , the optical depth would simply be an integral over the observed number counts , weighted by the distance ratio @xmath40 .",
    "the direct dependence on the cosmological volume @xmath32 would disappear , leaving only a weak dependence on cosmology through the distance ratio .    in practice",
    "the number counts will be measured well for some finite range of redshifts . given counts @xmath38 at redshift @xmath41 and parameterizing the evolution as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nstar ] ) , we would infer a number evolution parameter ) would include appropriate averages over @xmath41 . ]",
    "@xmath42 note that this value depends on the assumed cosmology through the volume element @xmath43 .",
    "assuming two different cosmologies ( `` 1 '' and `` 2 '' ) would lead to two different values of @xmath22 that are related by @xmath44 thus , when models are calibrated by observed galaxy counts at moderate redshifts , the function @xmath33 can not be the same for all cosmologies .",
    "the number density is the number counts divided by the cosmological volume element , so it necessarily depends on the assumed cosmological parameters . by using the same @xmath33 in all cosmologies , traditional models for lens statistics",
    "have violated this condition .",
    "let us construct new models that do not violate it .",
    "imagine that from observed galaxy counts we infer a number evolution parameter @xmath45 in a cosmology with @xmath36 .",
    "for other values of @xmath0 we can use eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) to compute the self - consistent value of @xmath22 , as in fig .",
    "[ fig : p ] . models with different values of @xmath0 now agree on the predicted number counts at @xmath41 ( by construction ) and are very similar over a wide range of redshifts @xmath46 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : counts2 ] . in other words ,",
    "the new models are consistent in that they agree on an observable quantity , galaxy number counts , independent of @xmath0 .",
    "[ fig : tau2 ] shows the lensing optical depth as a function of @xmath0 for these new models .",
    "the difference from the old models is striking : the dependence of the optical depth on @xmath0 is much smaller than before . in the old models , going from @xmath36 to @xmath47",
    "increased the number of lenses by a factor of 2.73.3 ( depending on the value of @xmath22 ) , while in the new models the increase is only 4043% if the calibration is at @xmath48 , or a mere 516% if @xmath49 .",
    "models constrained by galaxy counts at all redshifts as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau1c ] ) ( not shown ) lie between the @xmath49 and @xmath48 curves .",
    "the reduced dependence on @xmath0 is a direct result of calibrating the models with observed counts of distant galaxies .",
    "this qualitative conclusion does not depend on any particular values i have assumed , but arises simply from the idea that models for lens statistics can and should be constrained to agree with measurable galaxy counts at redshifts relevant for lensing .",
    "there is some residual sensitivity to cosmology through the distance ratio @xmath40 ( see eq .",
    "[ eq : tau1c ] ) , but it is much smaller than the volume effect and thus will be harder to detect .    the prospects for using real galaxy counts to calibrate models for lens statistics are good .",
    "the cnoc2 field galaxy redshift survey already contains @xmath505000 galaxies at @xmath51 ( lin et al .",
    "1999 ) , the sdss luminous red galaxy sample will have redshifts for @xmath50100,000 early - type galaxies out to @xmath1 ( eisenstein et al .",
    "2001 ) , and the deep redshift survey will include @xmath5060,000 galaxies at @xmath52 ( davis et al .",
    "the calibration of the models will be limited to some extent by completeness and selection effects , but with large samples it will be possible to make different cuts on the data to understand those effects ( see blanton et al .",
    "2001 ) . the calibration will also be limited by our understanding of the relationship between luminosity and mass  but that has always been true for models of lens statistics .",
    "the best bet is probably to turn the problem around : rather than trying to constrain @xmath0 , a joint study of galaxy counts and lensing could attempt to distinguish between evolution in luminosity and evolution in mass",
    ". that would be perhaps the most interesting future application of lens statistics .",
    "the optical depth for lensing is basically proportional to the number of galaxies on the sky at redshifts @xmath531 .",
    "traditionally that number was not well known , so models for lens statistics adopted a number density of galaxies and multiplied by the cosmological volume to get the number . with the assumed number density held fixed ,",
    "the expected number of lenses was proportional to the cosmological volume and hence very sensitive to @xmath0 .",
    "number counts of distant galaxies can now be measured directly , and they are inconsistent with the idea that the number density is independent of @xmath0 .",
    "this general point holds whether there is much or little redshift evolution in the galaxy population .",
    "constraining models for lens statistics to agree on distant galaxy counts makes them far less sensitive to @xmath0 . whereas the old models saw a factor of 3 change in the number of lenses between @xmath36 and @xmath47 , in the new models the change is @xmath541040% . using lens statistics to constrain @xmath0 may still be possible , but will be difficult",
    "this paper has focused on models where the deflector population is derived from observed galaxy populations , which i refer to as phenomenology models . in an alternate class that i call theory models ,",
    "the deflector population is described with a mass function from structure formation theory ; the resulting models are sensitive to cosmology not only through the volume element but also through @xmath55 and the growth of structure . in theory models the predicted number of lenses _ decreases _ as @xmath0 increases ( for flat cosmologies ; porciani & madau 2000 ; li & ostriker 2002 ) , which strongly disagrees with old phenomenology models but is less different from my new models . in quintessence models , phenomenology and theory models",
    "do agree that making the equation of state more negative increases the predicted number of lenses ( waga & miceli 1999 ; sarbu , rusin & ma 2001 ) .",
    "the differences between phenomenology and theory models clearly need further study .",
    "nevertheless , i would argue that the focus of lens statistics should move away from constraining @xmath0 and toward learning about the population of dark matter halos out to @xmath56 .",
    "i am very grateful to the referee , david rusin , for important criticisms and insightful comments .",
    "i also thank huan lin for interesting discussions and wayne hu for comments on the manuscript .",
