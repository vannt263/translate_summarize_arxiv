    "in this investigation we regard unitary operators as ` energy conserving ' if and only if they commute with the total hamiltonian . the resulting evolution is such that if the system initially is within an energy eigenspace it remains there .",
    "one can view this as a quantum counterpart to classical evolution that is restricted to an energy shell ( although the latter usually refers to a narrow range of energies , while we here assume a precise value ) .      in this section",
    "we justify the claim that one can not create a superposition between energy eigenstates from an initial state with a well defined energy , if we are limited to energy conserving unitary operations .",

    "if @xmath106 is an energy conserving unitary , it follows that @xmath109 .",
    "hence , @xmath118 is such that @xmath94 . by the above reasonings",
    ", we can conclude that the marginal states @xmath104 and @xmath105 must be block - diagonal .      as mentioned above , we here associate energy conservation with unitary operators that commute with the hamiltonian of the total system .",
    "one can imagine an alternative that only requires energy to be conserved on average , i.e. , that the expectation value of the energy after the operation is the same as before the operation .",
    "however , if this should hold for all possible initial states @xmath39 , one merely regains a unitary @xmath17 that commutes with the hamiltonian @xmath107 , since @xmath119 = 0 ,   \\end{split}\\ ] ] where @xmath120 denotes the set of density operators on @xmath121 . in other words , for a unitary operator that does not commute with @xmath107 , there always exists an initial state for which the average energy is not conserved .",
    "this type of on - average energy conserving unitary operations may also have the power to create and destroy superpositions between distinct energy eigenstates , without access to any additional resources .",
    "this can be illustrated by the following example .",
    "suppose that the hamiltonian @xmath107 has three eigenvalues @xmath122 , with corresponding eigenstates @xmath123 .",
    "as one can see , all states of the form @xmath124 with @xmath125 and @xmath126 , are such that @xmath127 . hence , any unitary operator @xmath17 such that @xmath128 would be energy conserving on average with respect to the initial state @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore , this operation creates the superposition @xmath129 of the two distinct energy eigenstates @xmath130 , from the initial diagonal state @xmath131 .",
    "the conjugate @xmath132 similarly destroys the superposition .",
    "hence , this class of operations has the power to create or destroy superpositions between energy eigenstates without additional resources .",
    "this example illustrates how basic assumptions can affect the nature of coherence as a resource .",
    "although interesting , we will not consider this question further , but rather focus on unitary operators that commute with the hamiltonian .",
    "as a first step to investigate the catalytic properties of coherence we here consider a simple model for energy conserving operations on a combination of a system and an energy reservoir . this type of model has previously been considered in @xcite .",
    "our model consists of two parts : a ` system ' @xmath1 , modeled by a finite - dimensional complex hilbert space @xmath18 , and an ` energy reservoir ' @xmath7 , modeled by a separable hilbert space @xmath133 .",

    "we make sure that for each pair of eigenstates in @xmath1 there is a transition ( in fact infinitely many ) in @xmath7 that can compensate for the change in energy .",
    "this allows for non - trivial energy - conserving unitary operations .",
    "( if @xmath20 is non - degenerate , we can only implement unitary operators that are diagonal in the joint eigenbasis .",

    "however , we will not consider such generalizations in this investigation , but proceed with the theoretically convenient restriction to perfect energy conservation .    as seen by the following lemma",
    ", the eigenspaces of the joint hamiltonian @xmath141 ( we should strictly speaking write @xmath142 ) have a very simple structure .    [ eigenspaces ] let @xmath134 be given .",

    "although the coherence is preserved in the dynamics of the doubly - infinite ladder - model , the state nevertheless appears to gradually get more broadly distributed over the ladder ( see sec .",

    "this one may suspect that the ` quality ' of the energy decreases .",

    "( one may note that in terms of expected energy , the injection is not lost , but merely adds to the extracted energy . )",

    "such investigations would require the development of a ( preferably operational ) measure of ordered energy that takes into account coherence in the energy carrier _ per se_.      as discussed in sec .",
    "[ translationphaseref ] , one can translate coherence into correlations using a reference system . although this specific construction merely yields separable states for sequential preparations ( see sec .",
    "[ seqseparable ] ) , one can speculate whether there exists some other type of correspondence between coherence and entanglement .",
    "there are many results on entanglement transformations that appear to echo properties of coherence transformations ( see e.g. @xcite ) , and this is perhaps most clearly illustrated by a qualitative analogy between coherent states and embezzling states ( which appears to be a bit of a quantum - information folklore ) .",
    "embezzling states @xcite essentially form a special parametric family of bipartite entangled states for which the degree of entanglement goes to infinity .",
    "analogous to how coherent states in the limit of high amplitude allow us to perform coherent operations ( in the standard jaynes - cummings model ) without changing the coherent state much , embezzling states do in the limit of a high degree of entanglement allow us to transform bipartite entangled states into each other , without changing the embezzling state much . in both cases we rely on the limit of high degree of the resource ( coherence / entanglement ) , and in both cases the resources",

    "in view of this analogy , one may wonder whether there exists some modification of the embezzling construction that would result in genuinely catalytic transformations , much as we here have turned coherence catalytic . in this context",
    "it might be worth to keep in mind that catalytic coherence primarily is a question of a particular type of _ dynamics _",
    ", rather than a special class of states .",
    "the concept of entanglement catalysis @xcite refers to the fact that bipartite state transformations by local operations and classical communication ( locc ) @xcite can be assisted by ancillary entangled states @xcite .",
    "more precisely , even if it would be impossible to transform a given bipartite pure state @xmath1185 into @xmath1186 by locc operations , there may exist a bipartite state @xmath1187 , such that @xmath1188 can be transformed into @xmath1189 .",
    "in other words , the state @xmath1187 enables the transformation , but is not consumed in the process .",
    "hence , the entanglement in @xmath1187 acts like a catalyst , similar to how coherence in the doubly - infinite ladder - model enables coherent operations .",
    "although analogous , one can notice some crucial differences in terms of the underlying resources and allowed operations . for entanglement catalysis",
    "the relevant resource is entanglement , and the allowed set of operations are locc .",
    "this should be compared with catalytic coherence , where the resources are ` off - diagonality ' and coherence , and the allowed operations forms a special class of energy conserving unitary transformations ( the @xmath19 in eq .",
    "( [ bijection ] ) ) .",
    "moreover , in the case of entanglement catalysis the ancillary state remains intact , while catalytic coherence only preserves certain aspects of the state of the energy reservoir ; the total state can change .    due to the differences in settings",
    "it may not be entirely clear how to proceed with a more precise comparison .",
    "we will not consider any detailed analysis here , but merely point out that one possible method would be to use the reformulation of coherence in terms of correlations with a reference , as developed in section [ translationphaseref ] ( although one should keep in mind that this translation may not necessarily be unique ) .",
    "the resulting bipartition allows us to compare the resulting set of allowed operations ( see fig .",
    "[ comparisoncohentang ] ) .",
    "a potential complication with this method is that we may need to take into account the equivalence relation introduced in sec .",
    "[ sec : equivalencerelation ] , i.e. , not all states are distinguishable from the point of view of the allowed measurements , which may influence how we should compare operations in the two settings .",
    "( an additional technical complication is that the main results on entanglement catalysis is obtained via the majorization condition @xcite , which restricts the analysis to pure states , while we generally allow mixed states in catalytic coherence . characterizations of mixed state state entanglement transformations and catalysis appear challenging @xcite . )    even though the settings and assumptions are different for these two types of catalysis , one could nevertheless speculate that they can be viewed as specific instances of a more general family of catalytic phenomena , where a given dynamical restriction is accompanied with a corresponding catalytic resource .",
    "general resource theories ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) may be useful to investigate under which conditions this is possible .",
    "if the dynamics in a physical system is constrained by a conservation law , it follows by the wigner - arkai - yanase theorem @xcite that observables which do not commute with the conserved quantity can only be measured approximately .",
    "the quality of the approximation depends on the measurement device , e.g. to what extent it contains suitable superpositions of eigenstates of the conserved quantity .",
    "these results have been extended @xcite , generalized to the continuous variable case @xcite , as well as been analyzed in the context of the resource theory of asymmetry @xcite .",
    "another version @xcite considers how accurately a given channel can be implemented under conservation laws .",
    "see also @xcite for implementations of operations via interactions with fields . in view of the way theorems it is no surprise that access to a high degree of coherence",
    "yields good approximations to energy mixing unitary operations .",
    "the purpose of the present investigation is not primarily to quantify the accuracy of implemented measurements or channels , but to establish how coherence evolves under repeated use .",
    "results on frame resources @xcite would intuitively suggest that an iteration leads to a gradual degradation .",
    "however , as we have seen , one can design models where the set of channels that can be implemented remains invariant . consequently , no matter of how we choose to quantify the quality of the implemented operations , this quality remains intact .",
    "another way of phrasing this would be to say that the degree of accuracy in some sense is ` decoupled ' from the degree of degradation ; irrespective of whether the coherence resource in the reservoir allows us to implement a ` high quality ' coherent operation or not , that quality remains intact .",
    "although the coherence thus is conserved in these models , the implementation of the channels nevertheless induces a back action on the reservoir .",
    "as speculated in sec .",
    "[ singleshotworkextr ] this may correspond to a loss of ordered energy .",
    "one could imagine to quantify this back action , where way theorems again may play a role .",
    "however , we will not consider this issue here , but leave it as an open question .",

    "<S> the question is to what extent coherence gets degraded when utilized . </S>",
    "<S> here it is shown that coherence can be turned into a catalyst , meaning that we can use it repeatedly without ever diminishing its power to enable coherent operations . </S>",

    "<S> introduction. _ coherence is a resource that enables us to implement coherent operations on quantum systems ; a canonical example being the use of lasers to put atoms in superposition between two energy levels @xcite , or analogously for radio - fields and nuclear spins @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> when we excite an atom we need another system , an ` energy reservoir ' , where the energy is taken . </S>",
    "<S> what kind of energy reservoir would we need in order to put an atom in superposition between two energies ? with a bit of thought </S>",
    "<S> one can realize that this is impossible if the atom and the reservoir initially have definite energies . </S>",
    "<S> ( see appendix [ energyconservecoh ] for details . </S>",
    "<S> this observation can be understood in the wider context of ` reference frames ' and symmetry preserving operations @xcite . ) </S>",
    "<S> one way to resolve the apparent contradiction with the above claim , that such superpositions indeed can be generated , is to realize that this usually is achieved via , e.g. , lasers or radio - fields . </S>",
    "<S> these are often modeled as coherent states , typically described as superpositions of the energy eigenstates of the electromagnetic field @xcite ( although this can be debated , see e.g.  @xcite ) . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> the coherence of the laser is a resource that enables us to put the atom in superposition , or more generally to perform operations that coherently mix energies .    </S>",
    "<S> the main result of this investigation is that coherence can be turned into a catalyst , in the sense that it enables otherwise impossible tasks , without itself being consumed . </S>",
    "<S> although maybe reminiscent of entanglement catalysis @xcite , this stands in contrast to other quantum resources , e.g. , reference frames for measurements , which appear to degrade upon use @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we establish catalytic coherence within two models . </S>",
    "<S> the first model ( the doubly - infinite energy ladder ) is convenient to analyze , but is somewhat unphysical in that its hamiltonian has no ground state . </S>",
    "<S> the second model ( the half - infinite ladder ) amends this problem . </S>",
    "<S> we furthermore numerically investigate remnants of catalytic coherence in the jaynes - cummings model @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we apply catalytic coherence to ` work extraction ' in the context of quantum thermodynamics .    _ the doubly - infinite energy ladder. _ catalytic coherence is achieved via a specific design of the interaction between the system and the energy reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> while this construction can be used to generate general coherent operations on @xmath0-level systems ( see appendix [ doublyinfinite ] ) we here focus on two - level systems . </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath1 be a system for which the hamiltonian @xmath2 has eigenvalues @xmath3 and @xmath4 , corresponding to the eigenstates @xmath5 and @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the hamiltonian of the reservoir @xmath7 is @xmath8 , where @xmath9 is the energy spacing in the ladder , @xmath10 is an orthonormal basis , and @xmath11 denotes the set of integers . </S>",
    "<S> regarded as a hamiltonian , @xmath12 is slightly odd in that it does not have any ground state . </S>",
    "<S> we shall remedy this problem shortly , but due to several convenient properties we shall use this model for the initial analysis . as a first step we define the ` shift - operator ' @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> as one can see , this unitary operator translates every state ` rigidly ' along the energy ladder ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figurecoherent ] ) . with the aid of @xmath14 </S>",
    "<S> we define the following family of unitary operators on @xmath15 @xmath16 where @xmath17 is an arbitrary unitary operator on @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> ( this type of interaction has previously been considered in quantum thermodynamics @xcite . ) by construction , all @xmath19 commute with @xmath20 , i.e. , they are energy conserving . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore they commute with all @xmath21 , and thus act uniformly over the energy ladder ( see @xcite for discussions on this ) . </S>",
    "<S> the family of all @xmath19 serves as the set of ` allowed operations ' in our model . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall investigate what kind of transformations we can implement on @xmath1 , and how this depends on the coherence in the reservoir @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> _ coherence and coherent operations. _ given a state @xmath22 on the reservoir we can implement channels on @xmath1 via @xmath23.\\ ] ] ( this generally requires time - control , see appendix [ sec : inducedch ] . ) we let @xmath24 denote the set of channels @xmath25 that can be obtained for arbitrary unitary @xmath17 , given @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> let us now see what aspects of @xmath22 it is that determine @xmath25 . if one inserts eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nkfjgbn ] ) into ( [ phidef ] ) , it turns out that @xmath25 , and thus @xmath24 , depends on @xmath22 only via expectation values of the form @xmath26 for @xmath27 ( which do not determine @xmath22 uniquely ) .    </S>",
    "<S> next , suppose we wish to perform a unitary operation that mixes different energy levels . by eqs .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nkfjgbn ] ) and ( [ phidef ] ) one can see that if @xmath28 for @xmath29 , then @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for general @xmath0-level systems , the necessary range of @xmath31 is determined by the amount of energy that the reservoir would need to donate or absorb . ) hence , when we speak of a ` high degree of coherence ' , it means that the state @xmath22 of the reservoir is such that @xmath28 for a broad range of @xmath31 , with the rationale that this allows us to perform coherent operations to a good approximation .    </S>",
    "<S> a concrete example is the family of states @xmath32 of the form @xmath33 , i.e. , uniform superpositions over a collection of consecutive energy eigenstates . in the limit of large @xmath34 </S>",
    "<S> , the channel @xmath35 converges to the unitary operation @xmath36 ( as one could expect from the wigner - arkai - yanase theorem @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> hence , this model is powerful enough to implement all unitary operations on @xmath1 , given a sufficient degree of coherence in the reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> next we show that the degree of coherence does not change over repeated applications .    _ catalytic coherence in the doubly - infinite ladder. _ to investigate the catalytic properties of the coherence , we need to determine how the state of the energy reservoir changes when we use it . for that purpose </S>",
    "<S> we define the corresponding channel on @xmath7 @xmath37.\\ ] ] by using eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ nkfjgbn ] ) one can confirm that @xmath38 = { { \\mathrm{tr}}}(\\delta^{a}\\sigma),\\ ] ] for all @xmath22 , @xmath39 , @xmath17 , and @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the expectation values @xmath40 are invariants under the action of these operations .    </S>",
    "<S> earlier we noted that it is precisely the expectation values @xmath41 that determine which channels that can be implemented . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if we use the reservoir a second time , we can implement the very same channels that we implemented the first time , i.e. , @xmath42 , and hence @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , we do not degrade the coherence resource in the reservoir by using it . in this sense </S>",
    "<S> , coherence is catalytic in this model . </S>",
    "<S> one can also prove a stronger type of catalytic property , which does not assume that the reservoir and the systems initially are uncorrelated , see appendix [ doublyinfinite ] . </S>",
    "<S> ( see also appendix [ translationphaseref ] for a reformulation of catalytic coherence in terms of correlations with a reference system . )    </S>",
    "<S> note that the catalytic property holds for all states @xmath22 on the reservoir , and is _ not _ limited to states with a high degree of coherence . </S>",
    "<S> it should also be emphasized that although @xmath44 are invariants , the underlying _ state _ does change ( see appendix [ doublyinfinite ] for an example ) , which is in contrast to entanglement catalysis @xcite . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> analogously to how measurements induce back - action on reference frames @xcite , there is indeed a back - action on the energy reservoir . </S>",
    "<S> however , as opposed to how certain reference frames appear to degrade due to back action @xcite , this change of state does not affect the usefulness of the coherence in the reservoir .    _ </S>",
    "<S> the half - infinite ladder. _ one might worry that the catalytic property is an anomaly related to the lack of ground state , as a broadening distribution otherwise would hit the bottom . in the following </S>",
    "<S> we shall show that the capacity to induce channels can be maintained indefinitely , also in a model that has a proper ground state . to this end </S>",
    "<S> , we cut away the lower half of the doubly - infinite ladder and thus obtain ( the spectrum of ) the harmonic oscillator @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> we define a new class of unitary operations on @xmath1 and @xmath7 as @xmath46 with @xmath47 as in equation ( [ nkfjgbn ] ) . by comparison </S>",
    "<S> one can see that @xmath19 and @xmath48 act identically on all states with at least one quantum , i.e , @xmath49 for @xmath50 . </S>",
    "<S> ( for a general @xmath1 this ` border zone ' would be larger , see appendix [ harmonic ] . )    _ protocol for a catalytic half - infinite ladder. _ a simple protocol can maintain the coherence properties of the reservoir indefinitely ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figurecycle ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we assume an initial state @xmath51 such that @xmath52 for @xmath53 , i.e. , it contains at least two quanta . </S>",
    "<S> we let @xmath7 and @xmath1 interact via some arbitrary choice of unitary @xmath54 . as we know from the above reasoning , the effect is identical to @xmath19 . </S>",
    "<S> the new state @xmath55 on the energy reservoir is such that @xmath56 for @xmath57 . </S>",
    "<S> now , consider an ancillary two - level system @xmath58 , with the two eigenstates @xmath59 and @xmath60 corresponding to the energies @xmath61 and @xmath9 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath58 initially is in the excited state @xmath60 . by applying the operation @xmath62 for @xmath63 , the state @xmath55 </S>",
    "<S> is translated one rung up along the ladder , to a new state @xmath64 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the reservoir is again in a state with at least two quanta . </S>",
    "<S> since these operations all have been performed on states safely away from the ground state , it follows that @xmath65 . by iterating this procedure </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that the set of channels that this reservoir can induce is kept intact indefinitely .    </S>",
    "<S> _ decay of coherence in the jaynes - cummings model. _ for many theoretical purposes it is enough to know that coherence in principle can be made catalytic . </S>",
    "<S> it is nevertheless relevant to ask to what extent these phenomena exist in more general types of systems , especially if one would consider experimental investigations . </S>",
    "<S> interactions between a two - level atom and a single mode of the electromagnetic field are often modeled via the jaynes - cummings ( jc ) hamiltonian @xmath66 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> here @xmath67 are the standard bosonic annihilation and creation operators @xmath68 = \\hat{1}_e$ ] , and @xmath69 , @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> similar to our designed interactions , the jc model also moves a quantum of energy between the atom and the reservoir ( much as in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ figurecoherent ] ) , but it does not act uniformly over the energy ladder . one can nevertheless find a ` shadow ' of catalytic coherence in the jc - model . </S>",
    "<S> the graphs in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : quasicatalytic ] suggest that the capacity to repeatedly induce coherent operations decays slower for higher initial average energies , even if the ` width ' of the initial superposition is fixed ( see appendix [ moregeneral ] for details ) .    _ </S>",
    "<S> application : coherence in expected work extraction. _ work extraction and the closely related concepts of information erasure and maxwell s demon have a long history ( see e.g. , @xcite ) with recently revived interests , e.g. , in the contexts of resource theories @xcite and single - shot statistical mechanics @xcite . the task is to extract as much useful energy as possible by equilibrating a system with hamiltonian @xmath2 and state @xmath39 with respect to a heat bath of temperature @xmath71 . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider the question of how much work that can be extracted in an average sense . </S>",
    "<S> standard results @xcite suggest that the expected work content of a system is characterized by @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the relative von neumann entropy , @xmath74 is boltzmann s constant , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> ( equation ( [ nskdfljv ] ) can be confirmed in a model without an explicit energy reservoir , see appendix [ withoutreservoir ] . )    however , in light of the above considerations , such approaches appear to implicitly assume access to ideal coherence resources . </S>",
    "<S> recently it has been shown @xcite that without any coherence , the optimal expected work content is not characterized by ( [ nskdfljv ] ) , but rather by @xmath78_{h_s}\\vert g(h_s)\\boldsymbol{)},\\ ] ] where @xmath79_{h_s } = \\sum_{l}p_{l}\\rho p_{l}$ ] , and @xmath80 are the projectors onto the eigenspaces of @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> however , one can show ( see appendix [ explicitenergyreservoirs ] ) that access to coherence increases the amount of work that can be extracted . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the limit of a large degree of coherence ( e.g. large @xmath34 for @xmath81 ) , one regains equation ( [ nskdfljv ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we can conclude that coherence sails up as an important resource alongside the expected work content . </S>",
    "<S> the question is how they relate . </S>",
    "<S> how much of one resource can be gained by spending the other ? </S>",
    "<S> the fact that we here perform the work - extraction analysis entirely within the doubly - infinite ladder model implies that we only use the coherence catalytically and do not ` spend ' it at all .    in relation to this thermodynamic application </S>",
    "<S> one may note @xcite , where optimal extraction is obtained irrespective of the state of the reservoir , via a larger class of unitary operations that only conserve energy on average , and has the power to create and destroy superpositions of energy eigenstates ( see appendix [ onaverage ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> note also @xcite , which uses a coherent extraction device as a negentropy source , to demonstrate a transient efficiency that exceeds the standard carnot bound for work extraction against a hot and a cold heat bath .    </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions and outlook. _ we have shown that coherence can be turned into a catalytic resource by a specific design of interactions , and used this to analyze work extraction . as observed in the single - shot setting @xcite , the expected work content may not always correspond to ordered ` work - like ' energy ( see discussions in @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is an open question if catalytic coherence is associated to a cost of ordered energy ( see appendix [ discussion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> another question is to quantify expected work extraction with limited access to coherence .    </S>",
    "<S> the existence of catalytic coherence raises the question whether other types of resources @xcite in some sense also can be turned catalytic . in view of the analogy between embezzling states @xcite and coherent states </S>",
    "<S> , one can speculate whether there exists some counterpart to catalytic coherence in that setting ( see appendix [ discussion ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can also ask whether catalytic coherence and entanglement catalysis @xcite are special cases of a more general class of catalytic phenomena ( see appendix [ discussion ] ) . on a more general level , </S>",
    "<S> the question is under what conditions , and in what sense , a resource can be made catalytic .    </S>",
