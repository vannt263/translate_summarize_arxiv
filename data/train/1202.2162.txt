    "a basic problem in dynamics is the understanding of the ergodic behavior of a given dynamical system .",
    "frequently this is translated into the knowledge of mixing properties of the system .",
    "once mixing is established it is natural to ask for the rate or speed of mixing of the system .    for hyperbolic systems and nonuniform hyperbolic ones , without or with singularities ,",
    "this kind of study is well understood and the techniques to do so have been developed by several authors .",
    "we indicate the works by sinai @xcite , pesin @xcite , pesin and barreira , @xcite , dolgopyat @xcite , ruelle @xcite , bowen @xcite , l - s young @xcite@xcite , benedicks @xcite , baladi @xcite , viana @xcite , walters @xcite , and the references therein to the interested reader .    when the system @xmath5 under study has singularities , the phase space is not the whole manifold and in this case one asks zero - lebesgue measure for the union @xmath6 of the set of singularities @xmath7 .",
    "this is the case of billiards , studied by sinai , chernov @xcite,@xcite , markarian @xcite , bunimovich @xcite and others . in these cases",
    "we have the additional difficulty that the stable and unstable manifolds of points may be arbitrarily short since their length is conditioned by the distance of the points to @xmath7 .",
    "in general , the presence of singularities adds complexity into the problem and makes the analysis much more difficult . nevertheless , in this paper , where we study a certain skew - product with singularities on the fiber , it is the presence of singularities , jointly with the expanding action in the base that enable us to obtain all the chaotic behavior of the system .    in this paper",
    "we are interested in the mixing properties of the skew - product is an automorphism of the measure space @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are measure spaces and the action of @xmath11 has the form @xmath12 where @xmath13 is an automorphism of the space @xmath9 ( the `` base '' ) and @xmath14 , with @xmath15 fixed , is an automorphism of @xmath10 ( the `` fiber '' ) .",
    "the concept of a skew - product extends directly to the case of endomorphisms . ] given by the @xmath1-endomorphism @xmath0\\times \\big([0,1 ] \\backslash \\ { 1/2\\}\\big ) \\to [ 0,1]\\times [ 0,1]$ ] defined by @xmath16 here , given a real number @xmath15 , @xmath17 stands for the greatest integer less or equal to @xmath15 .    since the denominator @xmath18 vanishes at @xmath19 , the line @xmath20 is constituted by singularities of @xmath3 .",
    "besides that , for @xmath21 we have that the vertical projection of @xmath22 sharply varies when @xmath23 .",
    "identifying @xmath24\\times [ 0,1]$ ] with the two - dimensional torus @xmath25 , the skew - product may be seen as defined in @xmath25 where the circle given by @xmath19 is a curve of singularities of @xmath3 .",
    "the successive iterates by @xmath3 of a rectangle @xmath26 are transformed into a denumerable set of strips accumulating onto the circle @xmath27 in the torus .",
    "this effect together with the fact that the pre - orbit by @xmath28 of the circle @xmath19 is dense in the torus are responsible of the rich chaotic dynamics observed in this system .",
    "since the length of vertical segments are preserved under @xmath3 , the action of @xmath3 on the vertical borders of @xmath26 is just a translation depending continously on @xmath29\\setminus \\{1/2\\}$ ] .",
    "hence , the stretching and accumulation of the iterates of @xmath26 onto the pre - orbit of the circle @xmath19 in the torus is due to the slipping effect of @xmath3 in the horizontal borders of @xmath26 .",
    "the skew - product @xmath3 can be also immersed in a one - parameter family of expanding skew - products with the same line of singularities : @xmath30 thus , it is interesting to detected the ergodic properties in the limit dynamics given by @xmath31 .",
    "for instance , transitivity , mixing and rate of mixing .    in this paper",
    "we prove that the skew - product @xmath3 is topologically mixing , preserves the lebesgue measure @xmath32 on the torus , is mixing with respect to @xmath32 and finally we prove that the rate of mixing is exponential .",
    "let @xmath33 be a @xmath34-dimensional manifold and assume that @xmath35 is a flow containing a transitive attractor @xmath36 with a hyperbolic singularity @xmath37 .",
    "the geometric lorenz attractor and any lorenz - like attractor satisfy these conditions , see @xcite .",
    "we consider the case when the singularity has three real eigenvalues @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and satisfy @xmath40 . via hartmann - groman theorem",
    "we assume that we have linearized coordinates in a neighborhood @xmath41 ^ 3 $ ] of the singularity @xmath42 in such a way that @xmath43 corresponds to @xmath44-axis , @xmath45 to @xmath46-axis and @xmath47 to @xmath48-axis .",
    "let @xmath49 be a transverse section to the flow so that every trajectory eventually crosses @xmath7 in the direction of the negative @xmath50-axis .",
    "consider also @xmath51 with @xmath52 to each @xmath53 the time @xmath54 such that @xmath55 is given by @xmath56 , and it is such that @xmath57 when @xmath58 .",
    "this fact has the effect that different slices parallel to @xmath46-axis of the section @xmath7 arrives to @xmath59 with a delay .",
    "hence , we can not see the return of each slice to @xmath7 at the same time , even when the expecting delay is bounded .",
    "assume now that we `` forget '' the effect of the singularity and consider that the return time is the same for points in a same slice .",
    "also `` forget '' the strong stable direction .",
    "note that the strong stable direction does not interfere in the dynamics of the geometric lorenz attractor .",
    "after these identifications , the dynamics in a neighborhood of @xmath42 occurs in the @xmath60 plane , and may be seen as a slipping in the vertical direction in order to annihilate the delay of time . since the delay goes to infinity as @xmath61 the slipping also goes to infinity when @xmath61 .",
    "thus , the dynamics there is given by @xmath62 with @xmath63 when @xmath61 . moreover , since the ratio @xmath64 is greater than one , the dynamics in the @xmath15 direction is expanding .",
    "thus , changing the name of the variable @xmath50 by @xmath65 , the skew - product @xmath66 may be seen as a simplified case of the slipping effect in singular hyperbolic attractors , as is the case of a lorenz - like attractor .      to announce in a precise way our results let us introduce some definitions and related facts proved elsewhere .",
    "let @xmath67 be a dynamical system defined on the space @xmath9 , @xmath68 a @xmath69-algebra of @xmath9 , and @xmath70 an @xmath3-invariant probability measure .",
    "the map @xmath3 is mixing if for all pair of sets @xmath71 , we have @xmath72    a form of mixing that can be defined without appealing to measures is the following    let @xmath73 be a continuous map defined in the topological space @xmath9 .",
    "we say that the dynamical system defined by @xmath3 is topologically mixing if for every pair of non - empty open subsets @xmath74 of @xmath9 there is @xmath75 such that @xmath76 .",
    "there is even a commonly used weaker notion : we say that the system defined by @xmath3 is topologically transitive if for every pair of non - empty open subsets @xmath74 of @xmath9 there is @xmath77 such that @xmath78 .",
    "it is well known that if a dynamical system is defined on topological space @xmath9 , @xmath68 is the borel @xmath69-algebra of @xmath9 and @xmath70 is a probability invariant measure such that @xmath79 for every open set @xmath13 of @xmath9 , then if the system is mixing it is topological mixing .",
    "this and other general results on ergodic theory may be found in @xcite , for instance .",
