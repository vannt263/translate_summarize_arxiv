    "in photonics light is used for information processing .",
    "the dimension of channels directing the light is limited by its wave length , which is typically several hundred nanometers . however ,",
    "if the information could be transferred to plasmons , these could in turn be guided through structures measured on the nanometer scale , as the plasmon wave length is of the order nanometers .",
    "this is the basis of the plasmonic devices that merge photonics and electronics @xcite .",
    "the transformation of information from a photon to a plasmon requires some intermediate electronic excitation as the photon carries a negligible momentum .",
    "these intermediate excitations could be elementary charge excitations , electrons or holes .",
    "angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) is a suitable tool to obtain information about the efficiency of the link between the incoming photon and the excitation of plasmons .",
    "however , the outgoing photoelectron carries information , not only about the @xmath6 interaction described by the spectral function , but also about the direct @xmath7 interaction .",
    "we report on the importance of the photoelectron - acoustic surface plasmon interaction yielding what we denote as @xmath1-plasmarons , not previously considered .",
    "the importance of arpes is of tremendous importance for the understanding of properties of solids . not only as a tool to map the single - electron band structure of compounds but also to learn about the influence of various many - body effects such as electron - electron interaction of itinerant electrons @xcite , local electron - electron coulomb repulsion in strongly correlated materials @xcite , the electron - phonon interaction @xcite and electron - plasmon interaction exciting so - called plasmarons @xcite .",
    "all these many - body effects renormalize the band structure observed in arpes .",
    "the photoemission process can by divided in three steps , the optical excitation , propagation of the photoelectron to the surface and finally its escape into the vacuum . in the first step the spectral function a(@xmath8 ) , describing the photo - hole relaxation , is in general considered to produce the bulk part of the photoemission spectrum",
    "sudden approximation _ is not appropriate in many cases .",
    "the second step is known to yield surface effects leading to misinterpretations of bulk properties @xcite .",
    "the features appearing in the photoemission spectra at binding energies higher than the single - particle bands could reflect _ extrinsic _ loss processes taking place in steps two and three .",
    "however , this part of the spectrum could also reflect _ intrinsic _ processes , which should be taken care of by the spectral function , giving rise to , e.g. lower - hubbard bands for strongly correlated materials . as pointed out by guzzo _",
    "_ @xcite the analysis and understanding of this part of the spectrum is poor in valence - band spectroscopy .",
    "a recent study of graphene , comparing arpes data and calculations of the spectral function focusing on the dynamics of the electron - electron interaction , suggests presence of plasmarons @xcite .",
    "the plasmaron , a composite excitation due to the long range interaction between elementary charges ( electrons or holes ) and plasmons was suggested almost half a century ago @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the arpes data @xcite is that the photoelectrons reaching the detector carries information of the interaction between the hole left behind and plasmons .",
    "we denote this excitations @xmath2-plasmarons , where @xmath2 refers to the hole - plasmon interaction . in a recent tunneling spectroscopy study plasmaron excitations of the hole - type",

    "a recent theoretical study of bilayer graphene , calculating the spectral function taking into account the electron - electron interaction within the random - phase approximation , reveals plasmaron excitations @xcite .",
    "the excitations are in this case due to the photohole - plasmon interaction and thus of the type @xmath2-plasmarons .",
    "these observations together indicate that plasmaron are a general feature of quasi 2d electron systems .",
    "there is a possibility that in step three of the photoemission process , the unscreened photoelectron , when detached from the electron gas of the compound on its way to the spectrometer , but still close enough to induce excitations in the material , will create collective excitations and thus loose some of its energy and momentum .",
    "this phenomena should be in particular important in cases when low energy surface localized plasmons could be excited .",
    "thus it is in principle possible that the additional lower energy feature in the arpes spectrum is due to plasmon excitations in the solid due to the electromagnetic field created by the decoupled outgoing photoelectron . in this case",
    "the elementary particle is an electron and not a hole and we denote the composite `` particle '' an @xmath1-plasmaron .",
    "the picture is obviously different from the interpretation that the feature reflects @xmath2-plasmaron excitations in the solid .    in the present study we focus on the third step of the photoemission process for the system p(2@xmath02)-k / graphite and calculate the dispersion of the @xmath1-plasmaron excitation rate .",
    "the system is ideal for the study of the third step due to the quasi-2d character of the electron structure which rule out the importance of the second step .",
