    "we study the propagation of a wave in a narrow but long , tubular domain of finite length whose cross - sections are circular and of varying area . in this case",
    ", the wave equation has a classical approximation depending on a single spatial variable in the long direction of the domain .",
    "this approximation is known as webster s equation ( [ webster ] ) .",
    "the geometry of the tube is represented by the area function @xmath0 whose values are cross - sectional areas of the domain .",
    "we derive this result in section ii .",
    "as the name suggests , this equation was derived by webster in 1919 @xcite but , citing edward eisner ( referring to p. a. martin article in @xcite ) - `` we see that there is little justification for this name .",
    "daniel bernoulli , euler , and lagrange all derived the equation and did most interesting work on its solution , more than 150 years before webster . ''    in section iii ,",
    "the link between the schrdinger s equation and [ webster ] is shown , offering an effective hamiltonian and a potential energy that can be thought as a perturbation to the `` free '' hamiltonian .",
    "the key feature of this document is the analysis in section v , where we obtain the first order harmonic corrections using perturbation theory on a well known geometry - gabriel s horn ( discussed in section iv ) .    in section vi ,",
    "an algorithm to obtain this frequency corrections in any order and geometry is provided . with this analysis",
    ", we can infer how much the instrument ( in the wind or brass family ) will be out of tune only by its geometry .",
    "from fluid mechanics , the material derivative @xmath1 is given by reynolds transport theorem .",
    "it can be stated as    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is the mass of the gas inside the tube ( which is constant ) , @xmath4 is its mass density , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are the volume and surfaces of integration along the tube and @xmath7 is the velocity of the gas in across the surface of integration .    choosing these domains of integration and reference axes , we refer to [ horn ] .        for a consistent and rigorous derivation , we assume the following conditions :    * the mass density is constant throughout the cross - section area but is time dependent @xmath8 ( later we will simplify this assumption ) . * the tube shape is fixed i.e. independent of time but not constant in @xmath9 , which by [ reynolds ] implies @xmath10 . *",
    "the ideal gas law @xmath11 holds , where @xmath12 is the pressure , @xmath13 the temperature ( assumed constant ) , @xmath14 the boltzmann constant and @xmath15 , being @xmath3 the mass of each particle ( assumed equal ) . * by newton s second law - @xmath16 . *",
    "the fluid is irrotational , meaning @xmath17 .",
    "hence , differential calculus tells us that we can always find a velocity potential @xmath18 , such that ( in one dimension ) @xmath19 .",
    "this offers a closed system of equations . solving all equations for @xmath12",
    ", we discard at the end the time derivative of @xmath4 .",
    "this is justified assuming that for long tubes , the local pressure variation is much larger than the local density fluctuation , obtaining webster s equation ( [ webster ] ) .",
    "@xmath20    where @xmath21 .",
    "physically , the measurable quantity in the laboratory is @xmath12 , justifying the form of [ webster ] .      using the concept of bulk modulus",
    ", we can easily derive ( but lacking physical intuiton ) equation ( [ webster ] ) .",
    "the differential volume for the gas section is @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the displacement of surfaces with equal pressure . by the ideal gas law",
    ", we can use the definition of bulk modulus @xmath24 ( assumed constant ) to obtain    @xmath25    from newton s second law we compute the gas volume acceleration due to pressure variation along @xmath9    @xmath26    substituting into the previous equation we have websters equation with @xmath27 .",
    "this is also the procedure used in @xcite .",
    "starting with webster s equation ( [ webster ] ) previously derived , we apply the following change of variables ( as in @xcite )    * @xmath28 , * @xmath29 , * the time dependence on @xmath12 is given by @xmath30 , * @xmath31 ,    which in turn implies    @xmath32    this is equivalent to the schrdinger equation for one dimensional scattering , where the particle s energy is now @xmath33 and the potential energy function ise replaced by @xmath34 . in literature , this equation is often called the _ horn function_. the `` potential energy '' can be thought as a normalized curvature and @xmath35 is ( apart from a numerical factor ) the radius of the horn .    we can even infer a hamiltonian operator from ( [ schrodinger ] )    @xmath36    since @xmath37 has no time dependence . in our case ,",
    "the tube is long ( compared with its radius ) , so we can treat the potential @xmath38 as a perturbation of the `` free '' hamiltonean .",
    "gabriel s horn , also called torricelli s trumpet , is the surface of revolution of @xmath39 about the x - axis for @xmath40 .",
    "it is therefore given by the following parametric equations ( @xcite )    @xmath41    where @xmath42 is the radius of the surface on @xmath43 .",
    "it is easy to show that this surface has finite volume , but infinite surface area .",
    "( computed with the _ wolfram alpha _ platform ) . ]",
    "we can see that , for [ gabriel ] , we have    @xmath44    so webster s and horn equations ( [ webster ] and [ schrodinger ] ) become respectively ( [ schorn ] ) and ( [ gweb ] ) .",

    "this could be achieved by expanding over a small parameter and we will do so in the next section .",
    "it is also hard to find the quantized frequencies without the use of a numerical method .",
    "as we will see , the perturbative method offers much more insight and simpler expressions to use on real situations .",
    "as stated in section iii , [ hamiltonian ] is the hamiltonian of the system , written as a sum of a `` free '' hamiltonian plus a perturbation .",
    "the latter term , for gabriel s horn , is written as @xmath49 .",
    "the solution of [ schorn ] for the free wave ( neglecting the potential ) is @xmath50 . from the boundary conditions",
    "@xmath51 will be quantized , so a sum over @xmath52 is performed , obtaining a fourier decomposition as we would expect .",
    "@xmath53    the tube is open on both sides , which means , the pressure must be @xmath54 on @xmath43 and @xmath55 ( defined as the constant ambient pressure ) . the origin is chosen so that the tube length is @xmath56 and the potential is regular .    at zeroth order ,",
    "the surface is constant . reverting the change of variables and denoting @xmath57 as the surface area at the origin , we have @xmath58 .",
    "the boundary conditions impose the quantization @xmath59 and the form ( [ psio ] )    @xmath60    which in turn offers the expected result @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the frequency of the sound wave and @xmath63 is an integer @xmath64 and @xmath56 is the real length of the tube .",
    "+    in the quantum mechanics formalism ( as the one outlined below ) , the wave function must be normalized so that an explicit expression for @xmath65 can be found .",
    "this is the merging point of the classical and quantum treatment so it must be carefully done .",
    "this can be done by the following algorithm :    * obtain the pressure profile and the length @xmath56 of the horn . with this , compute @xmath66 . normalize the pressure profile by @xmath67 . *",
    "performing the previous integral analitically , the factor @xmath65 will depend on @xmath67 . by the argument above",
    ", we can set @xmath68 in our model .    normalizing the square of the wave function over the tube results in    @xmath69      this model requires a test function and a minimizing parameter @xmath70 .",
    "as expected , our test function will be ( [ psio ] ) ( the free wave ) .",

    "there are no roots of @xmath73 , so the method ca nt be applied in this framework .",
    "incidentally , the variational method only provides a correction to the `` ground state '' , so we ca nt calculate to an arbitrary order the corrections to the frequency .    @xmath75     for a gabriel horn with @xmath76 u.l . , @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] . ]",
    "perturbation theory tells us that the difference in energy @xmath33 from @xmath79 in first order is    @xmath80    where @xmath81 is the unperturbed wave function .",
