    "in the last decade , there have been a great progress in the understanding of the global structure of complete , embedded minimal surfaces in @xmath2 . in @xcite ,",
    "colding and minicozzi showed that a complete , embedded minimal surfaces with finite topology in @xmath2 is proper .",
    "this result is also known as calabi - yau conjecture for embedded minimal surfaces in the literature .",
    "later , meeks and rosenberg generalized this result to complete , embedded minimal surfaces with positive injectivity radius in @xmath2 in @xcite . a nice survey on calabi - yau problem",

    "if we consider the question in more general settings , it is not hard to construct examples of non - properly embedded minimal surfaces with finite topology in a non - simply connected @xmath0-manifold , or in a simply connected @xmath0-manifold with some arbitrary metric .",
    "however , there is no known example of a non - properly embedded minimal surface with finite topology in a simply connected @xmath0-manifold with nonpositive curvature ( see final remarks ) .    on the other hand , the key lemma of @xcite to prove its main result also applies to all @xmath0-manifolds with nonpositive curvature .",
    "hence , the question of whether the generalization of calabi - yau conjecture for embedded minimal surfaces to simply connected @xmath0-manifolds with nonpositive curvature is true or not became interesting ( see final remarks ) . in this paper , we construct an example of non - properly embedded minimal plane in @xmath1 which shows that the calabi - yau conjecture for embedded minimal surfaces does not generalize to simply connected @xmath0-manifolds with nonpositive curvature . +",

    "we should note that our construction differs from the freedman and he s heuristic construction in the following way . in their construction",
    ", they want to apply to bridge principle to construct the sequence of minimal disks , then take the limit .",
    "however , the examples of curves in @xmath4 described in @xcite shows that such a limit might not give a connected plane , and bridges might escape to infinity . in our construction",
    ", it can be thought that we are still using the bridges , but we are also using the tunnels acting as barrier which prevents bridges to escape to infinity .",
    "however , because of these tunnels , while @xmath11 is a least area plane in @xmath142 ( @xmath1 with tunnels deleted ) , it is not a least area plane in @xmath1 anymore by @xcite .    on the other hand",
    ", one might try to use a `` bridge principle at infinity '' to construct such an example .",
    "in other words , one might start with infinite family of geodesic planes as in this paper , and try to build bridges in @xmath4 to connect the asymptotic boundaries of the geodesic planes , and take the limit .",
    "however , the problem with this approach would be when you make a bridge at infinity , one might completely lost the original geodesic planes which goes through the compact part , and get a completely different least area plane with the new asymptotic boundary which stays close to the asymptotic sphere @xmath4 .",
    "hence , the barrier tunnels in our construction are very essential to construct such an example .",
    "note also that it is known that if @xmath11 is a least area plane in @xmath1 with @xmath12 where @xmath8 is a simple closed curve which contains at least one smooth point , then @xmath11 is properly embedded in @xmath1 by @xcite .",
    "however , since neither @xmath11 is not least area in our example nor @xmath8 is a simple closed curve , @xcite does not apply here .",
    "also , even though our example gives a complete , non - properly embedded minimal plane in @xmath1 , it is still not known the existence of a complete , non - properly embedded least area plane in @xmath1 .",
    "so , it would be an interesting question whether there exists a non - properly embedded least area plane in @xmath1 .    as it is stated in the introduction , the key lemma of @xcite to prove its main result that _ a complete , embedded minimal surfaces with finite genus in @xmath2 is proper _ is also true for @xmath0-manifolds with non - positive curvature .",
    "however , the example constructed in this paper shows that even though the key lemma ( theorem 1 in @xcite ) is valid for minimal surfaces in @xmath1 , it does not imply the properly embeddedness in @xmath1 like in @xmath2 .",
    "if one considers our example constructed in this paper in the @xcite context , we get the following picture .",
    "@xmath11 ( in theorem 2.5 ) is a minimal plane in @xmath1 with positive injectivity radius .",
    "if one applies theorem 1 ( or theorem 3 ) of @xcite to @xmath11 in @xmath1 , we get a lamination @xmath444 where @xmath387 is the geodesic plane whose asymptotic boundary is the unit circle in @xmath445 . by using theorem 1 , they prove theorem 2 in @xcite which states that _ a complete embedded connected minimal surface in @xmath2 with positive injectivity radius is always properly embedded_.    our example @xmath11 shows that theorem 2 of @xcite is not true in @xmath1 , whereas theorem 1 of @xcite is valid in @xmath1 .",
    "now , what goes wrong to get properly embeddedness of @xmath11 in @xmath1 as in the case of @xmath2 in @xcite ? in the proof of theorem 2 in @xcite , meeks and rosenberg apply theorem 1 to a complete embedded minimal surface with positive injectivity radius in @xmath2 , and in the closure , they get a minimal lamination @xmath446 . by @xcite",
    ", they concluded that the limit leaves must be planes in @xmath2 .",
    "similarly , the limit leaf @xmath387 in our lamination @xmath307 is also a plane in @xmath1 .",
    "so , everything is similar so far .",
    "however , when you apply theorem 4 to @xmath446 , they show that @xmath14 must have bounded curvature in an @xmath447 neighborhood of the limit leaf .",
    "however , this contradicts to lemma 1.3 of @xcite which states that @xmath14 can not have unbounded curvature in the neighborhood of a limit leaf .",
    "on the other hand , theorem 4 is valid for @xmath307 in @xmath1 , too .",
    "hence , we get that @xmath11 must have bounded curvature in @xmath447 neighborhood of the limit leaf @xmath387 . unlike @xmath2 , this can happen in @xmath1 case as the high curvature regions which corresponds to _ the bridges _ in @xmath11 are far away from the limit leaf in @xmath1 .",
    "so , an analogous result of lemma 1.3 in @xcite is not true in @xmath1 in general , and this is the place where the technique in @xcite breaks down in @xmath1 case .    note also that in @xcite , meeks and tinaglia recently announced examples of non - properly embedded constant mean curvature surfaces of finite topology for any @xmath448 in @xmath1 .",
    "they also show that if @xmath449 then the surface must be properly embedded in @xmath1 .",
    "their example is different than ours , as they construct an infinite strip which is a constant mean curvature surface limiting into two constant mean curvature annuli in @xmath1 .",
    "the asymptotic boundary of this surface is a pair of infinite lines where each line spirals into a pair of circles ( asymptotic boundaries of the annuli ) ."
