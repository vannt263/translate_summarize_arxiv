    "while the 3-flavor framework has been solidly established as a standard paradigm , it may not constitute the ultimate description of the neutrino oscillation phenomena .",
    "striking deviations from the standard picture arise in the presence of new additional light neutrinos if these are mixed with the ordinary species . from the lep measurement of the invisible decay width of the z boson  @xcite , we know that there are only three light neutrinos which participate to the electroweak interactions .",
    "therefore , the new putative light neutral fermions must be `` sterile '' , i.e. singlets of the standard model gauge group , to be contrasted with the ordinary `` active '' neutrino species , which are members of weak isospin doublets .",
    "the theory is not able to provide solid information on the sterile neutrino mass - mixing properties , which ultimately need to be constrained ( and hopefully determined ) by the experiments .",
    "accordingly , any new opportunity to enlarge our knowledge of the sterile mass - mixing parameters should not remain unexploited . with this attitude , in the present paper we will investigate very light sterile neutrinos ( vls@xmath2 s ) , i.e. singlet neutral fermions separated from the active species by a mass - squared splitting in the range @xmath6~\\mathrm{ev}^2 $ ] . in particular , we will focus on the constraints attainable on the admixture of the electron neutrino with the new mass eigenstate @xmath7 , which is parametrized by the lepton matrix element @xmath4 .",
    "additional phenomenological motivation for investigating vls@xmath2 s comes from cosmology .",
    "in fact , for mass - squared splittings in the range @xmath3 $ ]  ev@xmath8 and sufficiently small admixtures @xmath9 , a fourth sterile neutrino is only partially thermalized in the early universe and thus provides a fractional contribution @xmath10 $ ] to the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom ( see  @xcite ) , in agreement with the latest cosmological measurements  @xcite , which indicate @xmath11 ( 95% c.l . ) . moreover , the absolute neutrino mass content implied by a 3 + 1 scheme involving a vls@xmath2 is very small and fully compatible with the existing upper limits ( see for example  @xcite ) .",

    "] @xcite .",
    "the existing constraints on the electron neutrino admixture with vls@xmath2 s are limited to the region of @xmath13 and were obtained by reactor experiments with baselines of a few tens of meters : bugey-3  @xcite , gsgen  @xcite and krasnoyarsk  @xcite .",
    "it is thus natural to expect that lower values of @xmath14 may be probed through reactor experiments with longer baselines and in particular by the novel @xmath0-dedicated experiments double chooz , reno and daya bay .",
    "we remind that the measurement of @xmath0 performed in such setups relies upon the observation of a disappearance phenomenon of the electron ( anti-)neutrinos driven by oscillations intervening at the atmospheric mass - squared splitting ( @xmath15ev@xmath8 ) , to which such detectors have been calibrated . in particular , the far site baselines ( ranging from 1 to 2@xmath16 km ) have been chosen in order to maximize the oscillation effects induced by such a frequency , while the near sites have been fixed at a few hundred meters from the reactors , where the ( 3-flavor ) oscillation effects are very small . in the presence of an additional oscillation frequency , as in the case of sterile neutrinos",
    ", it is expected a sensitivity of the same setups to mass - squared splittings in the range @xmath17~\\mathrm{ev}^2 $ ] , as these induce non negligible effects both at the far and at the near sites .",
    "indeed , this potentiality has been already recognized in previous works  @xcite , in which sensitivity studies have been performed . as real data from the @xmath0-dedicated reactor experiments have become now available ,",
    "it is timely to exploit them to constrain a window of the parameter space so far unexplored .",
    "the full potential of @xmath0-sensitive reactor experiments in constraining vls@xmath2 s properties arises from the exploitation of both their total rate and spectral energy information . unfortunately , at the moment , the spectral analysis of the data can not be made from outside the collaborations .",
    "indeed , while the double chooz  @xcite and daya bay  @xcite collaborations have performed such shape analyses , at the moment it is problematic to reproduce them accurately due to missing details on various aspects of the experiments . on the other hand ,",
    "the reno experiment has not ( yet ) performed such kind of analysis .",
    "for these reasons , in this work will limit our study to the total rate information .",
    "we plan to perform a spectral shape analysis in a future work , when more detailed information will be released by all the three collaborations",
    ".    a further limitation to the usage of these data comes from the uncertainty on the absolute reactor neutrino fluxes . indeed , their recent reevaluation performed in  @xcite",
    "has provided values @xmath18 larger than the previous accepted estimates  @xcite , resulting in the so called `` reactor anomaly ''  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) , i.e. a deficit in the total rates observed at all the reactor experiments with detectors placed at short ( @xmath19 m ) distances . at the moment",
    ", the origin of such a discrepancy is unknown and is matter of intense investigation .",
    "the anomaly may involve new physics intervening at short distances but also be related to systematics in the reactor flux calculations . in such a situation , when using reactor neutrino data , it is opportune not to rely upon that part of information extracted with assumptions on the emitted neutrino fluxes .    in spite of all such limitations ,",
    "the three @xmath0-dedicated reactor experiments can still provide precious information on vls@xmath2 s .",
    "as we will show , interesting constraints can be obtained _ independently _ on any assumption made on the absolute normalization of the reactor fluxes , by exploiting exclusively the _ comparison _ of the total rates measured at different baselines .",
    "this `` modus operandi ''  which is exactly the same one adopted for the determination of @xmath0  will prove very useful , as it will render the results completely independent of the debated theoretical determinations of the reactor neutrino fluxes .. ] in addition , this technique will render the results independent of any hypothetical sterile neutrino oscillation phenomenon occurring at baselines of a few meters , as invoked to explain the reactor  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) and gallium  @xcite anomalies ( for which higher values of the mass - squared splitting @xmath20 are relevant ) .",

    "the electron neutrino ( or antineutrino ) survival probability in vacuum is simply given by the expression @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the antineutrino propagation distance ( baseline ) , @xmath27 is the neutrino energy and @xmath28 .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , for @xmath26 and @xmath27 values of interest , the survival probability can be approximated as @xmath29 where small terms suppressed by the fourth power of the two matrix elements .",

    "( [ eq : phase ] ) becomes small both at the near and far site .",
    "iii ) for values of @xmath48  ev@xmath8 the phase becomes large and the oscillations get averaged due to the integration over the energy both at the near and far detectors of daya bay and reno , which are positioned at distances of at least few hundreds meters from the reactor cores . as a consequence , the effect of the oscillations cancel out in the near / far ratio of their total rates , which becomes insensitive to sterile neutrino oscillations .",
    "iv ) in the special case of double chooz , the role of the near detector is played by bugey-4 , which is a very short baseline ( @xmath49 m ) experiment .",
    "for this reason , in principle one could obtain information also on values of @xmath14 lying outside ( above ) the range under investigation .",
    "however , as in this paper we are not interested in such values , we will not consider such a potentiality .",
    "nuclear reactors release electron antineutrinos produced in the beta decays of the fission products of @xmath50u , @xmath51u , @xmath52pu , and @xmath53pu . in general , in a reactor experiment , a given detector ( labelled by the index @xmath54 ) will receive neutrinos from a number of reactors ( each labelled by the index @xmath55 ) having average thermal powers @xmath56 and located at distances @xmath57 from the detector . the time - averaged differential neutrino flux ( number of neutrinos per unit of time , area , and energy ) at such a detector due to the @xmath55-th reactor is given by @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the time - averaged fractional contribution of the @xmath60-th fissile nuclei to the total number of fissions occurring in the @xmath55-th reactor , @xmath61 is the corresponding average fission energy and @xmath62 is the neutrino spectrum per fission of the @xmath60-th branch .",
    "for equilibrium pressurized light water reactors , the fuel composition is very similar .",
    "therefore , lacking a detailed information on the fractions @xmath63 we used for all the reactors a common fuel composition @xmath64 equal to that of bugey  @xcite @xmath65 we have checked that this approximation induces negligible inaccuracies in the estimate of the ratios of the number of events expected with and without oscillations ( given in eq .",

    "we have assumed a gaussian shape having width reported in the published papers : [ @xmath83 % for double chooz , [ @xmath84% for reno and [ @xmath85% for daya bay .",
    "the differential cross section can be estimated as @xmath86 with @xmath87 taken from  @xcite .",
    "the total number of events theoretically expected in the presence of oscillations is obtained by integrating eq .",

    "these last ones only depend on baselines and thermal powers , and can be expressed as @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the relative weight of the @xmath55-th reactor to the total power emitted by all reactors .",
    "all the relevant information on the detector normalization parameters ( @xmath92 ) is encoded in the theoretical non - oscillated number of events @xmath101 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : nd ] ) , while the fractions @xmath98 only depend on the reactor powers and baselines .",
    "for all the experiments we will take ( or derive ) the numbers @xmath97 and the fractions @xmath98 from the published papers .    finally , for later use , we introduce the reactor - flux - weighted baseline of the @xmath54-th detector @xmath102 where each baseline has an effective fractional weight @xmath103 proportional to the geometrical factor @xmath94 @xmath104 the reactor - flux - weighted baselines will be helpful in the interpretation of the results obtained in multi - reactor experiments like reno and daya bay .",
    "the double chooz ( dc ) experiment makes use of the two chooz reactors each having a thermal power of @xmath105 .",
    "currently , the experiment is operating only with the far detector , since the near detector is not complete yet .",
    "this renders problematic the extraction of the parameter @xmath0 as its estimate would strongly depend on the theoretical absolute reactor neutrino fluxes . to mitigate this problem the collaboration used as an `` anchor '' the total rate measurement made by the short baseline experiment bugey-4  @xcite , which provides a rather precise measurement ( with a 1.4% error ) of the reactor antineutrino flux . in this way , the estimate of @xmath0 is independent of the normalization of the reactor fluxes and is also independent of the sterile neutrino oscillations possibly occurring at short baselines . , for which the sterile neutrino oscillations get completely averaged at the bugey-4 site ( see the discussion in  @xcite ) . ]",
    "the use of bugey-4 as an anchor point is practically equivalent to consider it as a near - site detector of the experiment . due to the very short baseline ( 15  m ) ,",
    "when working in a 3-flavor framework the expected rate of bugey-4 can be considered independent of @xmath0 .",
    "differently , when considering a 4-flavor scheme , one has to take into account that it can depend on the mass - mixing parameters , as we have done in our simulations .    while double chooz has performed a rate plus shape analysis , from outside the collaboration it is not possible to reproduce the spectral analysis since detailed information on the spectrum , in particular the bin - to - bin correlated errors , is missing .",
    "so , we restricted the analysis to the total rate information .",
    "we define the double chooz @xmath106 estimator as follows @xmath107 where @xmath108 ( @xmath109 is the ratio of the observed ( theoretical ) total fission cross - section of dc over that of bugey-4 .",

    "this is well justified for all the errors appearing in the eqs .",
    "( [ eq : chi2_doublechooz]-[eq : chi2_dayabay ] ) with the exception of the free normalization correction @xmath112 , which in principle should be treated as a common parameter in daya - bay and reno .",

    "instead , they are numbers obtained _ after _ correction with the ( best fit ) value of a normalization parameter derived by the @xmath106 minimization in a 3-flavor scheme .",
    "this is confirmed by our simulations , which , at the best fit point of the 3-flavor analysis , provide very small departures from zero of the normalization parameter @xmath112 .",
    "when ( hopefully ) daya bay and reno will provide the non - oscillated number of events expected at each detector as derived by an ab initio calculation , it will be possible ( and correct ) to use a common normalization parameter for both experiments .",
    "in such a case , their combined allowed / excluded mass - mixing parameters regions are expected to be slightly more restrictive with respect to those ones obtained in our analysis .",
    "before discussing the results of the full 4-flavor analysis we deem it useful to consider in some detail the simple 3-flavor case , which is obtained in the limit of @xmath113 . in this case , the electron neutrino survival probability , neglecting solar neutrino terms , depends only on the atmospheric mass - squared splitting @xmath32 and from @xmath0 . for the sake of precision in our analysis",
    "we include also the solar terms , fixing the solar parameters at their best fit values as obtained in the global analysis performed in  @xcite .        before commenting the 3-flavor analysis results it is opportune to compare our findings for the estimate of @xmath0 with those published by each single experiment . for this purpose",
    "we fix the value of the atmospheric mass - squared splitting at the minos best fit  @xcite @xmath114 , as done by all the three experiments .",
    "we obtain for double chooz , @xmath115 ( @xmath116 excluded at 2.9 @xmath82 ) in good agreement with the rate - only analysis made by the collaboration , which gives @xmath117 ( @xmath116 excluded at 3.3 @xmath82 ) . for reno",

    ", one can easily deduce the allowed ranges for the single parameters at the @xmath125 levels , by just projecting the 2-dimensional region onto the corresponding axis .",
    "it must be noted that all the three collaborations , double - chooz , reno and daya bay , consider the estimate of @xmath32 as an external input , since this parameter is precisely determined by minos . in our analysis",
    "we can leave this parameter free to vary .",
    "this allows us to check that the estimates of @xmath32 obtained by the three experiments are mutually consistent and that their global estimate is consistent with that obtained from the accelerators , which make use of a different measurement technique based on @xmath126 disappearance .    from the last panel in fig .",
    "1 we find that the global reactor estimate of the atmospheric splitting is @xmath127 ( 2 @xmath82 level ) , which is consistent with the determination obtained from minos @xmath128 ( 2 @xmath82 level ) , although it is much less precise .",
    "we observe a slight mismatch between the determination of both parameters @xmath0 and @xmath32 made by double chooz and those made by the other two experiments reno and daya bay , which is driven by the bigger rate suppression observed by double chooz .",
    "the comparison of the first panel with the second and third ones , shows that double chooz is complementary to reno and daya - bay in the determination of @xmath32 .",
    "as already observed in  @xcite , this behavior is due to the fact that at the double chooz far site baseline ( @xmath129 km ) the survival probability has maximal ( negative ) slope , while at reno ( @xmath130 km ) and daya - bay ( @xmath131 km ) it is close to its minimum . for this reason",
    ", the more precise measurement expected by double chooz with the near detector will be very important to improve the global accuracy of the ( reactor ) estimate of @xmath32 .    to this regard",

    "in the 4-flavor analysis we fix the atmospheric mass - squared splitting at the best fit value obtained by the global analysis performed in  @xcite .",
    "we have checked that the results show negligible differences varying this parameter in the interval currently allowed .",
    "as done in the 3-flavor case we also fix the solar parameters at their best fit values .",
    "therefore , the analysis depends on three parameters : the new mass - splitting @xmath14 and the two mixing angles @xmath0 and @xmath44 .",
    "we allow both mixing angles to vary in the range @xmath133 , ignoring the bigger uninteresting values lying in the `` dark octants '' corresponding to @xmath134 .",

    "qualitatively , we can observe that the two near detectors make possible a double near / far comparison , which is more informative than the single near / far comparison made by reno . by excluding from the analysis one of the two near halls ( eh1 or eh2 ) at a time",
    ", we have verified that each near / far ratio ( eh1/eh3 , eh2/eh3 ) contributes to constrain the region @xmath147ev@xmath8 .",
    "in addition , by removing from the analysis the far detectors ( located in eh3 ) we have checked that the  near / near \" ratio eh1/eh2 gives additional and complementary constraints in the same region . therefore , the three independent ratios confer to daya bay a much more strong constraining power compared with reno .",
    "finally , the fourth panel in fig .  2 shows the combination of the three experiments .",
    "apart from the upper region around @xmath148ev@xmath8 which is excluded by the double chooz / bugey-4 comparison , the rest of the plot is dominated by daya bay .",
    "let us now come to the most general case in which @xmath0 is treated as a free parameter . from the results displayed in fig .  3 ,",
    "the following qualitative observations can be done .",
    "i ) as expected , for all the three experiments the excluded regions are less restrictive if compared to the case of fixed @xmath0 since there is one additional parameter in the fit .",
    "ii ) in certain specific ranges of @xmath14 , which depend on the particular experiment , there is a complete loss of sensitivity .",
    "this behavior is imputable to degeneracies among @xmath0 and @xmath44 , whose effects can cancel out in the near / far ratios . in the case of double chooz such degeneracy problems are absent because @xmath0 can not mimic @xmath44 at the near site , where the 3-flavor effects are always negligible . at the contrary in reno",
    "such effects are extremely important . in this case",
    "the entire lobe centered around @xmath149ev@xmath8 disappears . in daya bay",
    "the degeneracies are mitigated because , as discussed above , three distinct baselines ( and rate ratios ) are probed .",
    "iii ) the impact of the degeneracies is almost neutralized in the global combination due to a synergy of the multiple baselines comparison .",
    "when cancellation effects occur in one experiment , this does not happen for the the other two ones . as a non - trivial result ,",
    "the combination of the three experiments is able to provide limits in all the region explored .",
    "the natural question arises on the behavior of the estimate of @xmath0 in the presence of 4-flavor effects .",
    "figure  4 answers this question by showing the 2-dimensional projection in the space spanned by [ @xmath150 , as determined after marginalization over the undisplayed variable @xmath44 .",
    "figure  4 shows that for @xmath151 the estimate of @xmath0 is quite robust and independent of the value of the new mass - squared splitting .",
    "its best fit value is always very close to that one obtained in the 3-flavor case and also the statistical significance for its non - zero value is comparable . in the interval",
    "@xmath152\\times 10^{-3}\\,{\\mathrm { ev}}^2 $ ] , which is centered around the atmospheric mass - squared splitting ( @xmath153 ) , the parameter @xmath0 has no lower bound .",
    "this behavior can be easily understood as in this case the two terms in eq .",
    "( [ eq : pee_approx ] ) , respectively driven by @xmath0 and @xmath44 , becomes almost identical and a complete degeneracy among the two parameters emerges . in other words , for such values of @xmath14",
    "all the reactor data could be interpreted in terms of pure @xmath44-driven oscillations without resorting to a non - zero @xmath0 . in practice , this interpretation is not possible due to the independent lower bound set on @xmath0 by t2k  @xcite , where 4-flavor effectsev@xmath8 ) of the 4-flavor effects in t2k can be found in  @xcite . ]",
    "are completely absent ( for @xmath154 ) or have at most a subleading role ( for a small non - zero value of @xmath155 ) .",
    "finally , for @xmath156ev@xmath8 one recovers again the standard interval for @xmath0 since the phase in eq .",
    "( [ eq : phase ] ) becomes very small with any 4-flavor effect .",
    "we have performed a detailed study of the limits attainable from the three @xmath0-sensitive reactor experiments double chooz , reno and daya bay on very light sterile neutrinos .",
    "we have shown that the multi - baseline total - rate comparison provided by such experiments makes it possible to obtain interesting constraints on the mixing matrix element @xmath4 for mass - squared splittings in the range @xmath3 $ ]  ev@xmath8 .",
    "in addition , our analysis shows that the reactor estimate of @xmath0 is robust and substantially independent of the 4-flavor - induced perturbations provided that new mass - squared splitting is not too low ( @xmath5 ) . due to a lack of information",
    "we have restricted our analysis to the total rates .",
    "we expect a substantial improvement of our limits with the inclusion of the spectral shape information , whose details , we hope , may become publicly available in the near future .",
    "equally important will be the clarification of the `` reactor anomaly '' , as it would allow us to use the information on the absolute neutrino fluxes , which was `` integrated out '' in our analysis . in this respect",
    ", the publication of the absolute neutrino flux measured by daya - bay and reno will be very important .",
    "while we have limited our study to reactor neutrinos , which are sensitive to the electron neutrino mixing @xmath157 , complementary information on vls@xmath2 s may be obtained from other kinds of experiments . in the explored range of mass - squared splittings",
    "one may expect subleading effects in long - baseline accelerator setups and in atmospheric neutrinos , which are sensitive to @xmath158 values similar to those explored in @xmath0-sensitive reactor experiments .",
    "in particular , one may constrain the matrix element @xmath159 by looking at the @xmath126 disappearance channel ( minos  @xcite , t2k  @xcite , and atmospheric data ) and at the minos neutral current measurements  @xcite and probe the product @xmath160 by looking at the appearance @xmath161 channel ( t2k  @xcite , icarus  @xcite , opera  @xcite and atmospheric data ) .",
    "finally , we would like to underline that the region of mass - mixing parameters not excluded by our analysis is of great interest for cosmology .",
    "in fact , for mass - squared splittings in the range @xmath3 $ ]  ev@xmath8 , and sufficiently small admixtures @xmath162 , a fourth sterile neutrino is only partially thermalized in the early universe and thus provides a fractional contribution @xmath10 $ ] to the number of effective relativistic degrees of freedom ( see  @xcite ) , as indicated by the latest cosmological measurements  @xcite , which give @xmath11 ( 95% c.l . ) .",
    "moreover , the absolute neutrino mass content implied by a 3 + 1 scheme involving a vls@xmath2 is very small and fully compatible with the existing ( sub - ev ) upper limits ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , a very light sterile neutrino is a credible candidate to explain the `` dark radiation '' excess and the preference for a hot dark matter component with particle mass in the sub - ev range recently emerged in cosmological data analyses  @xcite .",
    "these circumstances reinforce the motivation for a vigorous program of investigation aimed at improving the sensitivity to vls@xmath2 mass - mixing parameters and at assessing their impact in all the astroparticle `` laboratories '' .",
