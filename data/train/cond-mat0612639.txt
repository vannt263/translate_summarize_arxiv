    "spintronics devices require generation of high electron spin polarization in non - resonant excitation conditions and its conservation that must be sufficient to store and manipulate spin information .",
    "we show here that these requirements can be achieved at room temperature in dilute nitride iii - v semiconductor heterostructures under optical pumping . for this",
    ", we use spin - dependent capture of free electrons by deep paramagnetic centers present in semiconductor crystal . the spin - dependent capture results in dynamical polarization of bound electrons which , in its turn , acts as a spin filter increasing polarization of free electrons  @xcite .",
    "we demonstrate here , that , after a short optical pump pulse , the decay of both a difference of the free - electron spin - up and spin - down densities and their sum is controlled by the same fast spin relaxation in the conduction band . as a result ,",
    "the spin polarization of free electrons is constant while their total spin decays fast when the time delay increases .",
    "the samples under study are undoped 0.1-@xmath4m - thick gaas@xmath0n@xmath1 ( @xmath2 = 2.1 , 2.7 , 3.5% ) layers grown by mbe on a ( 001 ) gaas substrate  @xcite .",
    "we investigate electron spin properties by polarized time - resolved photoluminescence ( pl ) .",
    "the samples are excited along the growth axis ( @xmath5-axis ) by circularly ( @xmath6 ) polarized 1.5 ps pulses generated by a mode - locked ti - sapphire laser with a repetition rate of 80 mhz .",
    "the pl intensities co - polarized @xmath7 and counter - polarized @xmath8 with the excitation laser are recorded in the backward direction using a s1 photocathode hamamatsu streak camera with an overall time - resolution of 8 ps .",
    "we measure the pl circular polarization degree @xmath9 proportional to free - electron spin polarization @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the densities of spin - up and spin - down free electrons , and @xmath13 is the free - electron total density .",
    "simultaneously , we measure the free - electron ( total ) spin density @xmath14 , which for the bimolecular recombination process writes : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the total pl intensity .",
    "n@xmath17 alloy at room temperature .",
    "the laser excitation energy is _ _",
    "h__@xmath18 = 1.39 ev which corresponds to the photogeneration of carriers below gaas barrier .",
    "the pump average power is @xmath19 mw .",
    "detection energy corresponds to the dominant conduction band @xmath20 heavy - hole recombination  @xcite .",
    "dashed curves are calculated in framework of the applied model ( see text ) . ]",
    "figure 1 shows the experimental kinetics @xmath21 ( solid line ) , @xmath22 ( points ) and @xmath23 ( circles ) measured in gaas@xmath24n@xmath17 alloy at room temperature  @xcite .",
    "one can see that @xmath25  and @xmath26 first rise for @xmath27 ps , which results from relaxation and thermalization of photogenerated carriers . during this time",
    ", @xmath28 varies slightly being close to 25% .",
    "then the pl decays in two steps : the first one is fast and the second one is slower with the characteristic decay times of @xmath29 and @xmath30 ps , respectively . simultaneously with the fast initial pl decay , the pl polarization monotonously rises up to @xmath31% and afterwards keeps the value at least 2 ns as we estimated considering noise fluctuations .",
    "such a long conservation of the high pl polarization is quite surprising since at room temperature spin relaxation time of free electrons in undoped bulk semiconductors of a zinc - bland structure is of the order of magnitude of 100 ps  @xcite , i.e. 10 times shorter than we observed .",
    "however , the total electron spin @xmath26 decays fast with a single characteristic time of about 150 ps .",
    "let us give first a qualitative explanation of the effects observed . figure 2 describes schematically two successive regimes of the spin - dependent electron dynamics responsible for the formation of high electron spin polarization and its persistence under the circularly polarized interband pulsed photoexitation .",
    "we assume that ( i ) the density @xmath32 of photoinjected electrons exceeds the concentration @xmath33 of deep centers containing at equilibrium one electron per center , ( ii ) the deep center can only capture a photogenerated electron from the conduction band with a spin antiparallel to the spin of the already present electron , forming a singlet two - electron bound state  @xcite , ( iii ) the interband electron - hole recombination contributes negligibly to the balance regulating the electron and hole densities and ( iv ) photoinjected holes are unpolarized because of their fast spin relaxation  @xcite .",
    "the first regime starts when all the centers acquire the second electron , the fast electron capture is blocked and the further capture is controlled by the photohole nonradiative recombination with the bound electrons described by the hole lifetime @xmath34 , where @xmath35 is a constant .",
    "thus , the electron and hole densities decay as @xmath36 , @xmath37 ( solid line in fig .",
    "for the pl intensity one has @xmath38 .",
    "this regime ends at the moment @xmath39 when the spin minority photoelectrons disappear from the conduction band : @xmath40 .",
    "this time can be estimated by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the initial degree of electron spin polarization  @xcite . within the time @xmath39",
    "the minority density exponentially decreases to zero while the density of the majority electrons tends to a finite value @xmath43 which results in a monotonously increasing free - electron spin polarization up to @xmath44 , see the dotted curve in fig .",
    "the second regime is characterized by the almost unoccupied minority spin conduction subband and the spin - polarized bound electrons .",
    "the kinetics is governed by the free - electron spin relaxation time @xmath45 : the recombination rate for the free electrons and holes is given by @xmath46 .",
    "this can be understood taking into account the following balance of rates in the second regime .",
    "the decrease of the electron majority density due to the spin - flip processes is determined by the rate @xmath47 .",
    "the reverse - spin electrons are immediately captured by deep centers which next capture unpolarized holes to generate unpolarized paramagnetic centers .",
    "the majority free electrons are captured at the generated paramagnetic centers with the rate @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to the total decay rate @xmath46 for free photoelectrons , so that @xmath49 , @xmath50 while their spin polarization keeps on at the level @xmath44 .",
    "the densities of one - electron ( paramagnetic ) and two - electron ( nonmagnetic ) centers , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( @xmath53 ) , respectively , are constant .",
    "particularly , @xmath54 because the hole lifetime equals @xmath45 .",
    "the second regime ends at the moment @xmath55 when the decreasing free - electron density becomes smaller than @xmath52 and the further kinetics is determined by the hole recombination processes .",
    "the time @xmath56 is approximately given by @xmath57 which can remarkably exceed @xmath45 .",
    "it is worth to stress that in contrast to @xmath58 the time @xmath56 is a function of the pump intensity and can be varied in a wide range .",
    "in contrast to the two - stage decrease of the free - electron density @xmath59 with two characteristic times @xmath60 and @xmath45 ( solid line in fig .",
    "2a ) , the spin - dependent difference @xmath61 decays with a single characteristic time @xmath45 ( dashed line in fig .",
    "therefore , the total spin @xmath62 of free electrons is controlled by the short time , @xmath45 , of their spin relaxation : @xmath63 .    the experimental data in fig .",
    "1 are obtained at the pump average power of @xmath64 = 130 mw . at this power , as our estimations show ( see below ) , the ratio @xmath65 .",
    "in addition , the pl exponential decay at long delay also indicates bimolecular mechanism of recombination .",
    "this means that @xmath66 and @xmath67 up to 425 ps .",
    "thus , the suggested model can be applied for description of the experiment . since @xmath66 , the gaasn layer under study represents an intrinsic semiconductor where the lifetimes of photogenerated electrons and holes coincide , @xmath68 . at the first stage ,",
    "the pl decay time - constant , @xmath69 , is equal to @xmath70 ps , therefore , @xmath71 ps . at the second stage , where @xmath72 , the pl decay constant equals @xmath73 ps , which yields @xmath74 ps .",

    "]    the pl polarization is not sensitive to free - electron spin relaxation , and , therefore , it can not be used for measuring the time @xmath45 .",
    "however , the total free - electron spin @xmath26 decays exponentially with the time constant @xmath45 . the time was found from the experimental dependency @xmath23 shown in fig .  1 to be @xmath76 ps .",
    "within the experimental error , this value is two times longer than @xmath77 ps which coincides completely with the model predicting @xmath78 .",
    "thus , the measurement of slow pl decay time at spin - dependent recombination allows us to find the free - electron spin relaxation time .",
    "note , that the method is more precise as compared to the measurement of the total spin decay where the ratio of @xmath79 is found .",
    "the suggested model is based on the dynamical polarization of deep centers , which causes a decrease in the recombination rate of the majority spin electrons at the second regime .",
    "if the deep - center polarization is destroyed then the free - electron recombination rate increases up to the one at the fast regime .",
    "the disappearance of the slow range and the pl decay with the single short time @xmath80 ps are observed under the change of the exciting light polarization from the circular ( @xmath6 ) to linear ( @xmath75 ) ( fig .",
    "switching on the perpendicular magnetic field of 7.8 kg under @xmath6-pumping leads to the same effect ( fig .",
    "it again evidences the relevance of the suggested model .",
    "to describe the experimental results quantitatively , we use the set of equations  @xcite for the rates of the free- and bound - electron total spins , respectively , @xmath81 and @xmath82 , transformed to the form : @xmath83 here @xmath84 , @xmath85 are the photogeneration rates of electrons with the spin @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 is spin relaxation time of bound electrons , @xmath89 the unit vector directed along the growth axis @xmath5 coinciding with the exciting beam , @xmath90 are the larmor frequencies defined by @xmath91 , @xmath92 , @xmath93 and @xmath94 are the @xmath93-factors of free and bound electrons , @xmath95 is the magnetic field . note that @xmath96 , where @xmath97 are the densities of spin - up and spin - down paramagnetic centers , and we assume @xmath98 .",

    "note that the average value of @xmath28 measured within the plateau in fig . 1 equals 43% .",
    "it is two times smaller than the value , 95% , calculated assuming recombination of conduction electrons with heavy holes .",
