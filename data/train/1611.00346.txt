    "recent systematic surveys of the magnetic properties of hot stars ( mimes and bob surveys ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) have revealed a population of o- and b - type stars hosting significant surface magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "these magnetic fields are strong ( from a few hundred to tens of thousands of gauss ) , organised ( mainly dipolar ) and highly stable . theoretical models and magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations have explored the dynamical interaction of these magnetic fields with stellar rotation and mass - loss ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "both observation and theory show clearly that the stellar wind interaction with the magnetic field leads to wind confinement and channelling , generating a long - lived circumstellar magnetosphere ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "close to the star , the magnetic pressure dominates the kinetic pressure of the wind , forcing the wind to follow closed magnetic field lines in regions near the magnetic equatorial plane .",
    "far from the star , the kinetic pressure dominates the magnetic pressure due to the stronger decline of the magnetic energy density compared to the wind kinetic energy density .",
    "the radius at which the energy densities become equal is defined as the alfvn radius , which also marks the boundary of the inner magnetosphere . beyond the alfvn radius ,",
    "the stellar wind opens the magnetic field lines and generates a current sheet in the magnetic equatorial plane .",
    "this region is the middle magnetosphere , where the electrons are accelerated to relativistic speeds and gyrosynchrotron radio emission is expected to arise @xcite .",
    "the gyrosynchrotron emitting region extent is defined by these wind electrons returning to the star along the field lines .",
    "@xcite classified the magnetospheres into two broad physical categories , namely dynamical magnetospheres ( dm ) and centrifugal magnetospheres ( cm ) .",
    "this classification is based on two parameters : the degree of magnetic wind confinement characterized by the alfvn radius ( @xmath1 ) , and stellar rotation characterized by the kepler co - rotation radius ( @xmath2 ) . a dm results in the case of a slowly rotating star ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "in this case , wind plasma trapped in closed magnetic loops falls back onto the stellar surface on a dynamical timescale .",
    "a cm occurs in the case of a rapidly rotating star ( @xmath4 ) . in this case ,",
    "wind plasma caught in the region between @xmath5 and @xmath6 is centrifugally supported against infall .",
    "this results in long - term accumulation of plasma and consequently higher magnetospheric plasma density .    in stars with high mass - loss rates ,",
    "radio emission is usually produced by thermal free - free emission from the ionised stellar wind . however , as discussed above , non - thermal synchrotron emission may dominate the radio spectrum in the presence of magnetic field and relativistic electrons .",
    "electrons can be accelerated to relativistic speeds , either by magnetic reconnection near the current sheet in the middle magnetosphere @xcite or through fermi acceleration in strong shocks in the inner magnetosphere @xcite .",
    "thermal radio emission , x - ray emission and optical line emission are produced from the inner magnetosphere , whereas non - thermal radio emission comes from the middle magnetosphere .",
    "hence , non - thermal radio emission probes different regions of the magnetosphere .",
    "in addition , as the emitting plasma is optically thick at long wavelengths , radio radiation at different frequencies probes the stellar magnetosphere at different depths , and from different perspectives as the star rotates . as a consequence , magnetic stars show radio flux variability with the stellar rotation period .",
    "the rotation modulation in radio emission was first suggested by @xcite for a rigidly rotating magnetosphere .",
    "these modulations have been observed in the radio light curves of some magnetic b - a stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and have been then modeled by @xcite .",
    "some numerical simulations @xcite suggest that one requires both a magnetic field and a binary companion to explain the non - thermal radio emission from massive stars . in these simulations , the synchrotron radiation from single massive stars",
    "is produced relatively close to the star . due to the large free - free opacity of the stellar winds at radio wavelengths , radiation emitted too close to the star",
    "will be absorbed @xcite .",
    "when a star has a massive nearby binary companion ( orbital period of a few days ) , emission is produced from the wind collision region where shocks occur , which can escape due to a lower free - free opacity @xcite .",
    "thus the observed radio flux is likely to have a contribution due to the colliding wind in addition to the star s magnetosphere and thermal free - free emission from the star .",
    "various investigations have been carried out to observe the radio emission of magnetic a- and b - type stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , no such studies have been made of the radio properties of hotter magnetic b- and o - type stars .",
    "@xcite carried out a very large array ( vla ) survey on 88 o - type and early b - type stars , which are not known to be magnetic .",
    "they detected a total of 14 sources at 6 cm with six of them displaying non - thermal radio emission .",
    "they concluded that non - thermal radio emission is more common in very luminous stars .",
    "to homogenize the study of the physics of magnetospheres of hot stars , we are carrying out a systematic survey of the radio emission properties of the known magnetic o and b type stars at high frequencies using the karl j. jansky very large array ( jvla ) and at low frequencies using the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) . this paper reports the high frequency jvla observations .",
    "@xcite reported gmrt observations of 8 magnetic b type stars and 3 magnetic o type stars .",
    "out of the eight b - type stars , five were detected in both the 1390 and 610 mhz bands .",
    "the three o - type stars were observed only in the 1390 mhz band , and no detections were obtained .",
    "this result was explained as a consequence of free - free absorption by the freely flowing stellar wind exterior to the confined magnetosphere .",
    "the low frequency gmrt survey thus puts strong constraints on free - free absorption of radio emission , and combined with high frequency vla data can provide a more complete description of the characteristics of the medium surrounding the star .    in this paper",
    ", we present results of jvla observations of 18 known magnetic o- and b- type stars with masses @xmath7 . in ",

    "the other radio detected star hd37742 may host a weak magnetic field , and may not have much contribution from the magnetosphere .",
    "this has been confirmed as the comparison of mass - loss rates (  [ massloss ] ) and spectral index (  [ result ] ) strongly suggest that the emission from hd37742 is thermal .    on the contrary ,",
    "the mass loss rate of hd47129 is two orders of magnitude larger than the theoretical estimate .",
    "this is a close binary system consisting of o - type stars , with the secondary having a well ordered large scale magnetic field .",
    "in addition to thermal free - free emission from the ionized medium surrounding the individual components of the binary , a centrifugal magnetosphere surrounding the magnetic secondary star could be a source of non - thermal radio emission .",
    "in addition , in this close binary system , interacting winds of the binary can also give rise to thermal as well as non - thermal radio emission @xcite .",
    "thus the total radio emission in a close binary will be due to thermal components from individual stars , as well as thermal and non thermal component from the colliding wind region @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigated the total thermal flux from colliding wind binaries and found that it could be about 50% higher than that expected from the free - streaming stellar wind alone .",
    "mhd simulations by @xcite have shown that the thermal component due to the colliding wind will start to dominate at high frequencies @xmath84  ghz , where as the non - thermal component coming from the magnetosphere is likely to be absorbed . at lower frequencies ,",
    "emission from individual stars will be important .    however , if the stars in the binary system have large separation , the wind interaction is not likely to be effective .",
    "for example , hd37742 is in a binary system , but with a much longer orbital period ( @xmath622687 days ) and radio emission is explained well by the free - free emission of the ionized wind of the star , without any need to incorporate wind interaction .",
    "binarity remains a fundamental question regarding the non - thermal radio emission from o - type stars .",
    "@xcite concluded that non - thermal radio emission from o stars can not be explained by wind - embedded shocks , and is likely to be caused by a colliding wind shock .",
    "that would imply that all o stars with non - thermal radio emission should be members of binary or multiple system .",
    "of the 16 currently - known non - thermal radio emitting stars , 15 are confirmed binaries @xcite , however none of them is known to be a magnetic star . in our sample ,",
    "two of the detected o - type stars are known to be binaries .",
    "however , only hd47129 could be in the limit of being classified as colliding wind binary , with an orbital period of @xmath5614 days .",
    "other binary stars have much longer orbital periods , indicating large binary separations",
    ". simultaneous observations of hd47129 at different frequencies are required to understand if the emission is thermal or non - thermal , and to investigate any relationship with the binary properties of the system .",
    "observations on a larger sample of o - type stars may shed more light on correlation of binarity with non - thermal radio emission .",
    "the spectral index measurements may also be able to throw light on radio emission mechanism .",
    "we estimate a spectral index @xmath85 ranging from @xmath86 to @xmath87 , between 911 ghz frequencies .",
    "if the radio emission from hd47129 is purely non - thermal , the lowest expected flux density at 3ghz is about 0.26mjy using @xmath88 .",
    "@xcite estimated the minimum flux density to be about 50% of the maximum ( typically for mcp stars ) for oblique rotators , if the radio emission is modulated .",
    "thus one should have expected a flux density of @xmath89mjy at 10 cm , easily detectable at jvla sensitivity .",
    "thus the non - detection of hd47129 at 10 cm suggests that a significant contribution may come from the wind - wind interaction in this close binary system .",
    "we have searched the literature for single o - type stars that are thermal radio sources from the literature . while their numbers are handful , their theoretical mass - loss rates are in good agreement with mass - loss rates derived from their radio fluxes @xcite .",
    "the radio luminosities of the detected o - type stars are similar to the upper limits of the non - detected o - type stars .",
    "hence it is not clear whether the detected o - type stars exhibit radio luminosities that are quite different from those of the overall population of magnetic o stars ( i.e. the high - luminosity tail of a broad distribution ) , or if they represent only marginally brighter examples of a more uniform distribution .",
    "one surprising result is the lack of any detection of radio emission from ngc1624 - 2 , the star with the strongest magnetic field of the sample ( by nearly an order of magnitude ) .",
    "the observations of this star yield a @xmath83 upper limit that is similar to that of the other non - detected o - type stars .",
    "strong absorption by wind created from mass - loss could explain this .",
    "both the detected b - type stars , hd156424 and als9522 , host a cm and lie above all the non - detected b - type stars in fig [ fig : rarktl ] .",
    "this implies that both the detected stars have a larger radial extent of centrifugal support of magnetospheric plasma compared to the non - detected stars .",
    "the detected b - type stars are significantly more radio luminous than the majority of the upper limits of the non - detected b - type stars .",
    "in fact , for all but 3 of the undetected b - type stars , the radio luminosity upper limits are at least an order of magnitude below the detected stars .",
    "this implies that the radio emission properties of the detected stars are , statistically speaking , very different from those of the undetected stars .    in the case of the detected b - stars ,",
    "the implied mass loss rates are much higher than the theoretical estimates .",
    "since the detected b stars are not known to be in binaries , the excess flux is likely to be a contribution from the magnetosphere from the magnetic star .",
    "we can compare the radio detections of b - type stars in our sample to the vla survey of magnetic chemically peculiar ( mcp ) stars carried out by @xcite .",
    "they have detected a total of 16 out of 61 sources at 6 cm .",
    "they found a wide range of 6 cm radio luminosities for the detected bp stars , with log(l@xmath90 ) @xmath91 15.7 - 17.9 . the detected b - type stars from our sample have radio luminosities 17.4 and 17.7 at 3 cm .",
    "these values lie within the broad range of mcp stars .",
    "they have also found that the radio luminosities of mcp stars correlate positively with effective temperature and magnetic field strength .",

    "two other o - type stars , which are known to be in ( much longer - period ) binary systems ( hd108 , hd,191612 ) were not detected . only hd,37742 is detected in the s band .",
    "the general lack of detections of our targets in the s - band is probably due to free - free absorption by the free - streaming stellar wind .",
    "three stars , hd,37742 , hd47129 and hd156424 , were detected in the ka band .",
    "the radio flux of hd37742 and hd47129 in the ka band is consistently higher compared with that in the s and x bands .",
    "this can be explained by a dominant contribution of thermal flux .",
    "mass - loss rates were estimated for the detected stars using x band radio flux densities and were compared with the expected mass - loss rates from the theoretical models .",
    "however , there are some caveats in theoretical prediction of mass - loss rates as binarity and the presence of magnetic field were not taken into account .",
    "in addition , the theoretical estimates assume smooth density profiles , while clumping factors of order 10 are measured in o - type star winds .",
    "however , the clumpiness of the medium is not expected to change the mass - loss rate by more than a factor of 3 @xcite , much less than the discrepancy we note . for hd37742 , the theoretical estimate matches with that of observational one , suggesting that the radio emission is mostly thermal .",
    "the thermal nature of the hd37742 radio emission is also supported by the spectral index we measure . for the remaining 3 stars ,",
    "mass - loss rates estimated from radio observations were orders of magnitude higher compared to those predicted by theory .",
    "this may indicate significant contribution of the radio emission from other mechanisms than only thermal free - free emission .",
    "in magnetic stars , middle magnetosphere can give rise to non - thermal gyrosynchrotron emission .",
    "however , in case of binary systems , the stellar wind from both the stars may interact and produce thermal and non - thermal emission .",
    "the detected b- stars in our sample are not known to be in binary system , thus the additional mass - loss rate is likely to have contribution from the non - thermal emission of the magnetosphere .",
    "however , hd47129 is a close binary system and emission from colliding stellar winds could play a significant role .",
    "all the detected stars host centrifugal magnetospheres except for hd37742 , which hosts a dynamical magnetosphere",

    "we were unable to evaluate the nature of emission or variability of radio flux as we have a adopted snapshot approach to identify the stars that are emitting radio radiation . in order to understand the emission mechanisms and flux variability over the rotation period , we need to observe the detected stars simultaneously over all the frequencies .",
