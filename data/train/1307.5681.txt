    "<S> an archetype for exploring the quantum dissipation problem  @xcite is to start with the simplest quantum object , a two - level system describing a generic quantum bit embodied by spin states @xmath0 , and to couple it to an environment consisting of an infinite collection of quantum oscillators @xmath1 ( with continuous quantum number @xmath2 and energy @xmath3 ) . </S>",

    "<S> thus , these oscillators adiabatically tunnel with the spin between potential minima ; the displacement of the oscillators reduces their overlap , suppressing the tunneling amplitude to a value @xmath20 . extending this argument to low frequency modes ( @xmath21 ) </S>",

    "<S> we argue for a new alternative scenario : because the potential surface is shallow for low frequency modes , transitions to other oscillator states become possible . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , it is favorable for the oscillator wavefunction to include superpositions of coherent states with displacements _ opposite _ to those dictated by the spin . </S>",
    "<S> in that way , direct tunneling transitions between the two potential surfaces are favored whilst keeping the main weight of the wavefunctions at low energy . </S>",

    "<S> .    the strong competition between spin tunneling and oscillator displacement can not indeed be fulfilled by a single coherent state , even if optimized variationally . </S>",

    "<S> further works aiming at refining the variational ansatz focused on the simple single - mode case  @xcite , or were restricted to a non fully - optimal variational state  @xcite . in light of the above discussion , the defects of the sh ansatz are readily traced back to the lack of bath entanglement in wavefunction  ( [ sh])only the polaronic response is encoded in @xmath28 . to capture the missing antipolaronic contributions and so the complete entanglement structure of the bath , we propose here a systematic coherent - state expansion of the many - body ground state : @xmath29,\\ ] ] with @xmath30 the @xmath31 coherent state appearing in the wavefunction . </S>",
