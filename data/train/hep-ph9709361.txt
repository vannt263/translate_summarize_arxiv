    "neutrinos are the most weakly coupled particles observed in nature , a fact that makes their detailed experimental study rather difficult . understanding the underlying properties of these massless or almost massless neutral fermions",
    "will definitely shed light on a number of fundamental questions in particle and astro - particle physics . in the minimal standard model ( sm ) ,",
    "the neutrinos are strictly massless by construction , due to the absence of right - handed neutrino states .",
    "however , all other fermionic matter , _",
    "i.e. _ , the charged leptons and quarks , require the existence of right - handed fields",
    ". how should one understand theoretically this asymmetry of the fermionic degrees of freedom in the sm ?",
    "another long - standing puzzle is related to the energy deficit of the solar and atmospheric neutrinos .",
    "a possible solution to all these problems may be achieved by means of the see - saw mechanism @xcite , which requires the existence of right - handed neutrino fields in addition to the left - handed ones of the minimal sm .",
    "then , very large majorana masses can be present in the extended sm lagrangian , and , together with dirac terms of order of charged - lepton or quark masses , form the entries of the see - saw mass matrix .",
    "diagonalization of the see - saw mass matrix naturally gives rise to non - zero , but very small neutrino masses , in agreement with experiment , as well as to ultra - heavy neutrinos not yet discovered .",
    "furthermore , a possible explanation of the atmospheric and solar neutrino problems may be based on the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein mechanism @xcite , which also requires that , contrary to the sm , the known neutrinos be massive .",
    "finally , reconciliation of the atmospheric , solar , and large scale neutrino detector ( lsnd ) anomalies is only possible if four low - mass neutrinos exist @xcite .",
    "the latter may be regarded as a strong indication in favour of fourth - generation extensions of the sm .",
    "if all neutrino problems can indeed be resolved by the presence of new heavy neutral leptons , one has then to investigate possible consequences emanating from these exotic particles .",
    "there are strict experimental bounds from direct searches at lep1 and , to a lesser extend , at lep2 for new heavy fermions with appreciable couplings to the @xmath3 boson .",
    "however , even if heavy particles are not directly accessible at present energies , they can still leave their imprints by inducing noticeable deviations at the quantum level through the oblique electroweak parameters , which have now been tightly constrained by lep1 measurements .",
    "such heavy particles may also have an observable impact on the triple - gauge - boson couplings , which are directly accessible at lep2 .    in this paper , we",
    "study loop effects of exotic heavy leptons on the cross sections of the following four processes : ( i ) @xmath4 ; ( ii ) @xmath5 ; ( iii ) @xmath6 ; and ( iv ) @xmath2 . to that end",
    ", we consider two favourable models , which are renormalizable . in the first model , which was first discussed by hill and paschos ( hp ) @xcite ,",
    "the fermionic sector of the sm is extended by adding one sequential weak isodoublet , one right - handed neutrino , and one right - handed charged lepton . after spontaneous symmetry breaking , the left - handed neutrinos couple to the right - handed neutrino with dirac masses proportional to the charged lepton masses , whereas the right - handed neutrino develops a majorana mass at the electroweak scale .",
    "the hp model can naturally predict a mass hierarchy between the different neutrino species .",
    "since the charged lepton of the fourth generation must be heavy for phenomenological reasons , the fourth doublet neutrino then turns out to be heavy as well .",
    "furthermore , inter - family mixing between the three generations and the fourth one is suppressed by the usual see - saw relations and can thus be safely neglected . to render the hp model anomaly - free ,",
    "however , one should include one additional quark isodoublet and one pair of up - type and down - type right - handed quarks .",
    "the second favourable model that could potentially allow for large loop effects of exotic leptons is due to ma and roy ( mr ) @xcite . as was argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , the mr model may be a viable low - energy limit of e@xmath1 unified theories .",
    "the mr model is slightly more economical than the hp model , since it only contains two colourless doublets with opposite weak isospins and one isosinglet neutrino in addition to the sm field content .",
    "because of this mirror assignment of the two weak isodoublets , the mr model is anomaly free by itself ; the quark sector does not need to be extended .",
    "apart from dirac masses , the isosinglet neutrino can introduce a lepton - number - violating majorana mass into the lagrangian .",
    "as we shall see , the two mirror isodoublets can form a singlet mass term for the heavy charged lepton . among other things",
    ", the mr model leads to both left- and right - handed couplings of the @xmath7 boson to the heavy charged lepton and the heavy neutrinos .",
    "recently , an analysis of heavy - lepton effects on the reaction @xmath8 in the context of the hp model has been reported @xcite .",
    "we have checked that our results agree with those of ref .",
    "the salient difference between our analysis and that of ref .",
    "@xcite resides in the fact that our numerical predictions are obtained after imposing the constraints on the parameters of the hp model that come from experimental bounds on the oblique electroweak parameters and from direct searches for new heavy leptons . to our knowledge",
    ", similar studies have not yet been performed for the production of neutral vector bosons or for the mr model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ sec : models ] , we describe the basic low - energy structure of the hp and mr scenarios .",
    "section  [ sec : vvv ] contains , in analytic form , the resulting one - loop corrections to the cross sections of processes  ( i)(iv ) .",
    "technical details of the calculation are relegated to the appendices . in section  [ sec : discus ] , we present numerical predictions , relevant for lep2 , for the loop effects due to exotic leptons within the context of the hp and mr models , after the parameter spaces of these models have been constrained by imposing limits derived from oblique electroweak parameters and direct searches .",
    "our conclusions are summarized in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "in the following , we present a brief outline of the hp and mr models . both models are based on the sm gauge group su(2)@xmath9u(1 ) , but contain new isodoublet and isosinglet fields .",
    "the resulting gauge interactions are different for the two models , which in turn may lead to different phenomenological consequences .      in the hp model @xcite , the lepton and quark isodoublets @xmath10 and @xmath11 as well as the four right - handed fields @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are added to the sm . to avoid tight limits coming from the observed sector ,",
