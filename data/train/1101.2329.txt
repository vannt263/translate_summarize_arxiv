    "eruptive young stars , defined by their episodically increased optical and infrared brightness , form a small subclass of sun - like pms stars .",
    "traditionally they are divided into two groups : fu orionis type stars ( fuors ) exhibit an initial brightening of 5  mag during several months or years , followed by a fading phase of up to several decades or a century .",
    "the other group , ex lupi - type stars ( exors ) are characterized by relatively short , recurrent outbursts which last some weeks to months , and the time between the eruptions ranges from months to years . in both classes",
    "the outbursts are believed to be powered by enhanced accretion from the circumstellar disc on to the star . in the standard picture",
    "the inward spiralling material piles up close to the inner edge of the accretion disk , and falls on to the stellar surface as a result of a gravitational and thermal instability @xcite .    in 2003 , the outburst of the low - mass young stellar object v1647  ori triggered a large number of observations from x - ray to far - infrared wavelengths . based on these ground - based and space - born measurements",
    "it was suggested that this object fits neither into the fuor nor exor class .",
    "it was outlined that the outburst  unlike in other young eruptive stars where enhanced accretion is the main physical driver behind the brightening  consisted of the combination of two effects of comparable amplitude .",
    "they are an intrinsic brightening related to the appearance of a new , accretion - related hot component in the system , and a dust - clearing event which reduced the extinction along the line - of - sight ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the simultaneity of the accretion and extinction changes suggests that they might be physically linked , and the changing accretion luminosity causes changes in the inner disc structure .",
    "another example for such combined processes may be v1184  tau @xcite whose optical and infrared photometric observations have shown that the large photometric decline was associated with variation in the inner disc structure @xcite . that the variable extinction may have an important role in the brightening refines the picture of the fuor / exor phenomenon , moreover such rearrangements of the inner disc structure have a potentially high importance for the evolution of the terrestrial zone of circumstellar disk .",
    "the target of our multi - wavelength variability study , pv  cep is an eruptive young star , which was originally classified as member of the exor class by @xcite , on the basis of its large outburst in 19771979 @xcite .",
    "currently the star undergoes significant brightness changes which we have been monitoring for years .",
    "our first observations indicated that pv  cep might be another example for accretion - induced structural changes , and this motivated our further detailed study of the object .",
    "the role of variable circumstellar extinction was also apparent in the dramatic brightness decline observed in the near infrared between 2008 april and june by @xcite .",
    "several further observed properties distinguish pv cep from exors , and indicate that the object may be more similar in nature to v1647  ori .",
    "such properties are e.g. the time - scale of the outburst ( @xmath1years ) , the a - type absorption spectrum observed at the beginning of the outburst @xcite , the class  i spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xcite , the associated high - mass circumstellar disc ( 0.76m@xmath2 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , variable reflection nebula @xcite , molecular outflow @xcite , and parsec - scale optical jet @xcite .",
    "we carried out a comprehensive optical and infrared photometric and optical spectroscopic monitoring of pv  cep during the low - brightness state in 20082010 , and we have a few additional measurements from 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 . in this paper",
    "we combine these data with archival and new near- and mid - infrared data , obtained in 20042010 , to better understand the nature of pv  cep and the nature of physical processes which affect the inner disk structure and evolution .",
    "photometric observations in the @xmath3 bands spanning the time interval between 2004 september 22 and 2010 november 23 were performed with six instruments on five telescopes .",
    "most of the data were obtained with the 60/90/180  cm schmidt telescope of the konkoly observatory , equipped with a photometrics at  200 camera and with the 1-m rcc telescope of the konkoly observatory , equipped with a princeton instruments versarray:1300b camera . pv cep was also observed with the iac80 telescope of the teide observatory ( spain ) between 2009 october 25 and november 7 .",
    "more detailed description of these instruments is given in @xcite .",
    "in 2008 august and 2009 october we obtained _ vri _ images with the cafos instrument installed on the 2.2  m telescope of the calar alto observatory ( spain ) .",
    "exposure times were between 90 and 180s per image .",
    "i_@xmath4 magnitude on 2004",
    "september 22 was derived from a ccd - image obtained with the 2.6-m telescope of byurakan observatory , armenia , and shown in the paper of @xcite .",
    "the image of pv  cep was saturated , and its magnitude was derived by fitting the psf to the unsaturated wing of the stellar image . on 2010",
    "april 8 we used the electro multiplying ( em ) andor technology ixon@xmath5 camera at the rcc telescope of the konkoly observatory .",
    "we obtained a series of 100 exposures in the _",
    "i_@xmath6 band with exposure times of 20s per image in em mode ( the nominal em gain was 50 ) .",
    "the image processing was made with the software tools written by @xcite .",
    "all the other images were reduced in iraf . in order to transform instrumental magnitudes into the standard system , we calibrated 16 stars in the field of view of the 1-m telescope ( @xmath7 ) in @xmath3 bands .",
    "calibration was made during six photometric nights .",
    "standard stars in ngc  7790 , published by @xcite , were used as reference . equatorial coordinates and derived @xmath3 magnitudes with uncertainties of the comparison stars are listed in table  [ tab_comp ] .",
    "the results of the photometry for pv  cep are presented in table  [ tab_phot ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig_lcmulti_long ] .",
    "the photometric errors were derived from quadratic sums of the formal errors of the instrumental magnitudes and those of the coefficients of the transformation equations .",
    "the telescope used for each observation is shown in the last column of table  [ tab_phot ] ."
