    "the coherent transport of electromagnetic , electronic and acoustic waves through random media has long been a central issue in physics @xcite . in recent years",
    ", there has been a revival of interest in the impact of inhomogeneities and defects in the transmission properties in quasi - one - dimensional ( q1d ) systems @xcite and is the subject of intense research including the electronic conductance of nanowires , nanotubes and nano ribbons @xcite , the propagation of slow light through disordered photonic - crystal waveguides @xcite or acoustic propagation @xcite .",
    "a correct description of wave transport through inhomogeneous media involves not only `` propagating '' traveling modes ( `` open '' channels ) but it is also very sensitive to near - field `` evanescent '' modes ( `` closed '' channels ) @xcite . the contribution of evanescent modes has been known for a long time in the analysis of inhomogeneous waveguides and periodic structures like multilayered frequency selective surfaces @xcite , being particularly important near the thresholds of new propagating modes where the coupling between open and closed channels lead to geometric resonance effects @xcite .",
    "however , the statistical properties of transport through disordered q1d systems , obtained from numerical calculations , do not depend on the evanescent modes @xcite and they are in good agreement with theoretical scaling approaches @xcite , including the celebrated dorokhov - mello - pereyra - kumar ( dmpk ) @xcite and nonlinear sigma - model @xcite approaches , which do not take into account explicitly evanescent modes .",
    "why evanescent modes are critical for a given configuration while it seems they play no role after statistical averaging over different configurations ? one of our main goals here is to provide an answer to this open question .    in this letter , we use numerical simulations and a perturbative analytical approach to analyze the influence of evanescent modes on the statistical properties of the transport coefficients of a thin disordered slab inside a wire or waveguide .",
    "the influence of the evanescent modes is analyzed in the asymptotic region for the far field and no near to the physical interface of the disordered region , where is well known that the evanescent modes affect strongly the statistics of the near - field @xcite .",
    "the wave number @xmath0 is considered halfway between the threshold of the last propagating mode and the first evanescent mode ; this avoids the strong influence of the first evanescent mode on the statistical scattering properties when @xmath0 is near to the threshold of a new propagating mode @xcite .    assuming a weak scattering , non - dissipative , random medium with white - noise statistics , we find that the statistical averages of ( power ) transmittances and reflectances are solely determined by the mean free paths ( mfps ) ( in agreement with scaling theory ) .",
    "as we will show , in the so - called dense weak scattering limit ( dwsl ) @xcite , the mfps themselves do not depend on the evanescent modes . in striking contrast ,",
    "the statistical average of the scattered field ( coherent field ) present a completely different behavior ( which was not captured by previous scaling approaches ) .",
    "the propagation of the coherent wave field @xcite is characterized by an effective wave number , whose real part determines the speed of propagation , while its imaginary part represents the losses due to scattering ( often known as waveguide extrinsic losses ) . as the wave propagates , the amplitude of the coherent part decays exponentially , whose rate decrease is the scattering mfp .",
    "we will see that the scattering mfp is insensitive to evanescent modes , while changes in the phase of the coherent field ( i.e. in the real part of the effective wave number ) are solely related to evanescent modes .",
