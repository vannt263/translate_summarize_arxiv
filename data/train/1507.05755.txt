    "this should also have an effect on the scaling of the transition temperature and rounding .",
    "we presented results on the canonical finite - size scaling of the droplet condensation - evaporation transition . to this end",
    ", we performed a comparative study in which we considered two- and three - dimensional lattice gas as well as three - dimensional off - lattice lennard - jones gas models in order to draw general conclusions . in all cases",
    ", we could verify the theoretical predictions about the finite - size corrections to the transition temperature @xmath212 and the finite - size rounding @xmath213 in the limit of large systems  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we identified an intermediate regime with an effective different scaling behavior in all three cases , most apparent in the finite - size rounding .",
    "this regime is consistent with results from flexible polymers  @xcite , where the aggregate included most of the polymers .",
    "our measurement of the average droplet size in equilibrium with vapor at coexistence showed that indeed for small system sizes a large fraction of the system is included in the single macroscopic droplet .",
    "the scaling of the droplet size , however , is nicely described by the theoretical predictions  @xcite in the limit of large systems .    without knowledge of the larger system sizes",
    ", the intermediate regime could give way to a wrong finite - size scaling behavior with qualitatively good fit results for both the transition temperature and rounding .",
    "however , we were able to show that there is a gradual crossover to the large - system scaling regime which can be approximately described by including empirical higher - order corrections to the theoretical scaling predictions , namely polynomial orders of the critical droplet size . if only the leading - order corrections are considered , the rounding is a good source getting a lower fit limit for a qualitatively good fit .",
    "this was compared to analytic and low - temperature results for the lattice cases .",
    "it is thus also suitable in order to identify the finite - size scaling regime for phase transitions with mixed phases , like the condensation - evaporation transition but also more complex systems like polymer aggregation . considering only the local , intermediate regime and applying standard finite - size scaling approaches ( with possibly wrong corrections ) would then lead to wrong estimates of the infinite - system limit .",
    "a similar note of caution has been recently demonstrated in the finite - size scaling of self - avoiding walks on percolation clusters  @xcite .",
    "an intuitive approach to the leading - order finite - size scaling corrections is the competition of volume ( @xmath214 ) and surface ( @xmath215 ) contributions . for a first - order phase transition ,",
    "this gives rise to a finite - size correction of the order @xmath216 , where @xmath217 is the relevant length scale of the system  @xcite .",
    "we argue that the linear extension of the droplet @xmath73 at coexistence plays this dominant role .",
    "the condensation - evaporation transition clearly connects a homogeneous and a mixed phase in the canonical ensemble .",
    "however , within the canonical approach , we may consider a ( virtual ) subsystem with the volume of the transition droplet . by translational invariance",
    ", this subsystem may be always constructed around the largest droplet . above the transition temperature , this subsystem includes a homogeneous gas phase while at and below the transition it is filled by the largest droplet and hence shows a homogeneous liquid phase .",
    "thus , this may be interpreted as a grand - canonical transition between homogeneous phases in the virtual system spanned by the volume of the critical droplet . by construction",
    ", this virtual volume would have open boundary conditions yielding a finite - size shift of order @xmath66 and a finite - size rounding of order @xmath218 .",
    "this picture is consistent with rigorous results for non - periodic first - order phase transitions  @xcite .",
    "however , this argument relies on the finite - size scaling of @xmath20 , which was shown to be already non - trivial .",
    "the present study shows that considering an orthogonal crossing of the phase boundary still yields the same finite - size corrections and serves as a complementary tool . on the example of the transition rounding",
    ", the fixed - density approach was shown to be closer to the expected large - system scaling behavior already for smaller system sizes . in general , both directions have their advantages and drawbacks both numerically and systematically .",
    "this may be exploited for one s benefit by choosing the suitable direction for the problem at hand , as was also recently demonstrated for the blume - capel model  @xcite .",
