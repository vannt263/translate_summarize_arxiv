    "hence these systems can be regarded as fluid in the limit of the statistical error . for @xmath111",
    "the accordance of @xmath150 with a gaussian is quite good for @xmath42 for all times , but decreases rapidly as @xmath1 is increased until @xmath175 . above this density",
    "the increase of @xmath171 slows down and for @xmath176 , @xmath171 almost saturates .",
    "the same behavior occurs for @xmath177 , but the non - gaussian parameter has always a higher value than for @xmath111 .",
    "the saturation can be explained by the rate of collisions in the system , as a collision results in strong bonding for @xmath111 and 70 . in systems with @xmath178 collision events",
    "are rarer than in denser systems , indicating that more particles remain mobile because they diffusive freely between the collision events .",
    "the second moment of @xmath150 , which determines its width , decreases as time passes , and @xmath2 and @xmath1 are increased ( see e.g.  fig .",
    "[ fig : hove_04 ] ) .",
    "moreover the fourth moment , the kurtosis , decreases too ( see also  fig .  [",
    "fig : hove_04 ] ) , but more rapidly than the second moment , because in total @xmath171 increases .",
    "therefore @xmath171 quantifies the immobility of the particles compared to a fluid .",
    "we observe that @xmath171 increases gradually when @xmath1 is increased . by varying @xmath2 and @xmath1 , we can tune the system in a way that the deviation from a gaussian of @xmath150 , @xmath171 covers the dynamics of the system from fluid to fully static .     as a function of density : the panels show different correlation times , while the colors and symbol style refer to different bond strengths . in ( a )",
    "the correlation time is @xmath179 , in ( b ) 3.2 , in ( c ) 6.4 and in ( d ) 8 .",
    "the color and symbol code is the same for all times , with black crosses for @xmath180 , red stars for @xmath181 , green crosses for 20 , blue diamonds for 40 and purple triangles for @xmath182 .",
    "[ fig : alpha2],width=302 ]",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the proposed model of hysteretic bond formation displays a variety of properties that are consistent with network formation . depending on the strength of the bonding springs , we observe a crossover from transient network formation to an arrested quasi static network .",
    "we have used the two - body time - dependent ( van hove ) correlation function to characterize the dynamic structure . a clear crossover from a fluid behavior at low spring constants to an arrested liquid - like structure at high spring constants and high densities is observed .",
    "this manifests itself in a clearly non - gaussian shape of the self part and an increased correlation length and time in the distinct part for high spring constants .",
    "moreover the crossover is quantized by the non - gaussian parameter @xmath171 , which allows a more precise study of the crossover in the parameter range .",
    "moreover , we have find that the mobility of the particles can be tuned in the fluid regime by variation of the bond strength and the density .",
    "our model can describe loose transient networks , where the rate of bonding and annihilation of bonds is high , as well as a strongly interacting network , in which new bonds last over a long period of time .",
    "this is supported by our statistical analysis of the bond forming and vanishing process .    in future work",
    ", it would be very interesting to complement our simulation work by a theoretical approach that would describe network formation in fluids .",
    "one possible candidate for such a theory is the recent power functional approach , where the dynamics of a brownian many - body systems is obtained from a variational principle on the one - body level  @xcite .",
    "generalizing this approach in order to introduce the hysteretic bond formation process constitutes an interesting research task for the future .",
    "the results presented in this paper pave the way to the analysis of the behavior of transient network formation with varying hysteretic behavior .",
    "the model allows one to change the critical parameters of the hysteretic interaction and evaluate the effects on network formation .",
    "hence , one is able to identify the signature behavior of hysteretic systems",
    ". known exampled of these systems , such as those governed by capillary forces , could also provide experimental confirmation .",
    "discovering non - obvious hysteretic behavior could be of importance for characterizing the network formation behavior of polymers or polymer particles , such as those used in the paint and coating industries  @xcite .",
