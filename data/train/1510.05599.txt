    "optical interactions between excited dye molecules or excitons in semiconductor structures and resonant optical cavity modes or surface plasmons in metal structures can lead to a mixed state with dispersion characterized by an anticrossing gap ( rabi splitting ) in the resonance region .",
    "a strong coupling regime is established when the _ coherent _ energy exchange between two systems exceeds incoherent losses through radiative or nonradiative mechanisms , while the rabi splitting magnitude can vary over a wide range @xcite .",
    "for example , a relatively weak rabi splitting in the range @xmath0 @xmath1ev  1 mev was reported for a semiconductor quantum dot ( qd ) radiatively coupled to a cavity mode @xcite , whereas a much larger splitting ( above 100 mev ) was observed for surface plasmons coupled to excitons in j - aggregates @xcite , individual dye molecules @xcite , or semiconductor qds @xcite .",
    "a weaker , although still significant , rabi splitting ( @xmath210 mev ) was reported for quantum well excitons coupled to surface - plasmon polaritons @xcite or to graphene plasmons @xcite .",
    "recently , strong coupling between molecular vibrational modes and cavity modes in raman scattering experiments was reported @xcite .",

    "the interference of electron pathways in confined structures gives rise to , e.g. , the analog of dicke superradiance in resonant tunneling through several qds @xcite , fabry - prot interference in electron waveguides @xcite , or extraordinary electron transmission through a qd lattice @xcite .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , a physical mechanism that could give rise to a strong coupling regime in electron transport has yet to be suggested .",
    "here we demonstrate that a strong coupling regime can be realized in resonant tunneling through a periodic chain of qds ( qdc ) @xcite placed between two parallel semiconductor quantum wires ( qw ) @xcite ( see the inset in fig .",

    "we show that even for weak tunneling between individual qds and qws , the momentum - selective transitions between the qdc states and bloch states in qws cause an anticrossing of the bloch band dispersion and resonant energy level , leading to rabi splitting of the conduction peak . a perpendicular magnetic field , by breaking the symmetry between the left and right qws , leads to a fine structure of the conductance lineshape .",

    "the emergence of a strong coupling regime in a periodic system with weak tunneling can be traced to the conservation of quasimomentum @xmath36 that leads to transition resonances between the qdc and qws at the bloch bands energy shell [ see eq .",
    "( [ self - lsb ] ) ] . note that this momentum - selective mechanism is somewhat analogous to resonant coupling between quantum well excitons and plasmons on a metal surface @xcite or in graphene @xcite , where in - plane momentum conservation by the coulomb coupling leads to the anticrossing of exciton and plasmon dispersions in the momentum space .",
    "the magnitude of rabi splitting ( [ rabi ] ) depends on the tunnel coupling @xmath8 between qdc and qws and on the electron mobility in qws characterized by the scattering rate @xmath106 .",
