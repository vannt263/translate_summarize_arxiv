    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the merits of m31 include the following : it has a simple geometry ; potential m31 distance - indicator stars are bright enough to be resolved ; it is a local counterpart to the spiral galaxies that are used to determine the extragalactic distance ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "in addition , time - series observations of two m31 fields , using the large binocular telescope , have also detected a number of short - period cepheids @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite combined data from the pomme survey and _ hst _ observations for 68 cepheids , and derive a true distance of @xmath39  kpc to the m31 .",
    "@xcite presented a catalog of m31 cepheids , including fundamental and first overtone cepheids ( as well as type ii cepheids ) , based on the first year of the panoramic survey telescope and rapid response system ( ps1 , pan - starrs1 ) pandromeda survey .",
    "a summary of these surveys and projects is presented in table  [ tab1 ] , and the coverage for some of the surveys is shown in figure  [ fig.surveys ] .",
    "these studies are limited in that most of the observations , with the exception of the pomme survey and the pandromeda survey , cover only part of m31 , and most of them concentrate on the disk ( see figure  [ fig.surveys ] ) .",
    "furthermore , no cepheids with periods longer than @xmath6 days were detected in these studies .",
    "therefore , we have initiated a program to search for ulpcs in m31 by using data from the palomar transient factory ( ptf ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",

    "the @xmath3-band follow - up observations were carried out with the p60 telescope ( p60 ; * ? ? ? * ) at the palomar observatory and the lulin 1 m telescope ( lot ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at lulin observatory .",
    "these observations began in 2012 october and ended in 2013 november .",
    "p60 is equipped with a @xmath40 ccd with a pixel scale of @xmath41 arcsec per pixel , while lot used a @xmath42 ccd with a pixel scale of @xmath43 arcsec per pixel .",

    "imaging data from p60 was reduced with a dedicated pipeline as described in @xcite . for lot images , subroutines in iraf",

    "the lot @xmath44-band images suffered from a fringing problem . to remove the fringe patterns ,",
    "we median combined the @xmath44-band images for candidates with an internal i d 4 - 1047 and created a master fringe image .",
    "we selected the images for this candidate because it is located far away from the m31 bulge and disk ( see figure 1 in paper i ) .",
    "hence , the images do not have a strong background gradient .",
    "the master fringe image was smoothed by a `` boxcar '' averaging algorithm available from iraf , and then scaled and subtracted from all of the lot @xmath44-band images .",
    "astrometric refinement for both p60- and lot - reduced images were performed using astrometry.net @xcite .",

    "it can be seen that some images with large seeing could be affected by bad weather .",
    "after visual inspection , images that were affected by bad weather were discarded .",
    "this left 568 and 386 images from p60 and lot , respectively .",

    ", we first created a `` master '' catalog ( with @xmath32 stars ) that included : ( 1 ) the location of the ulpc candidate itself ; ( 2 ) faint stars in the vicinity of the candidate star ( selected based on the best seeing images ) ; and ( 3 ) relatively bright ( @xmath45 to @xmath46 ) and isolated stars taken from the m31 local group survey catalog ( lgs ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these lgs stars were visually inspected to ensure they were located within the p60 and lot images , as well as away from any crowded regions in the images .",
    "about @xmath47 to @xmath48 lgs stars in the `` master '' catalog were used to construct the psf model for each image by executing the iraf subroutines daophot.phot , daophot.pstselect and daophot.psf .",
    "sky coordinates for all the stars in the `` master '' catalogs were then converted to pixel coordinates and saved as a coordinate file .",
    "finally , daophot.phot and daophot.allstar were run with the input coordinate file and psf model to obtain the instrumental psf photometry for the stars in the `` master '' catalog .",
    "the @xmath3-band light curves for the eight candidates were constructed using differential photometry techniques given in @xcite . instead of using a single star as a comparison star ( cs ) to obtain differential photometry ,",
    "the technique presented in @xcite used a number of stars ( either all stars in the images or a subset of suitable constant stars ) to construct an artificial comparison star :    @xmath49    where @xmath50 was the instrumental magnitudes for our candidates in either the @xmath51 or @xmath44 band , and @xmath52 were the weights for individual comparison stars such that @xmath53 .",
    "at the first stage , we constructed differential photometry light curves for a pair of lgs stars in our `` master '' catalogs , as mentioned in the previous section , by taking one of them as a comparison star .",
    "we then removed those lgs stars that exhibited a large scatter in the differential light curves .",
    "this left a subset of good lgs stars before equation ( 1 ) was applied to each of our candidates .",
    "since the calibrated @xmath3-band magnitudes were available for these comparison stars from the lgs catalog , light curves constructed from equation ( 1 ) were calibrated via the following equation :    @xmath54    lllccc 8 - 0326 & lot & v & 56218.62510 & 18.819 & 0.031 + 8 - 0326 & lot & v & 56224.71680 & 18.931 & 0.034 + 8 - 0326 & lot & v & 56224.71403 & 18.935 & 0.033 + 8 - 0326 & lot & v & 56235.64163 & 19.026 & 0.038 + @xmath8&@xmath8&@xmath8&@xmath8&@xmath8&@xmath8    where @xmath52 were the same weights as in equation ( 1 ) , and @xmath55 were the @xmath3-band magnitudes from the lgs catalog .",

    "furthermore , there is no @xmath3-band photometric data available for these cepheids currently .      in the previous sub - section",
    ", we adopted a distance modulus for m31 in order to verify the ulpc nature of our candidates . in this sub - section , we reverse the problem by using the two confirmed ulpcs to determine the distance modulus of m31 , i.e. , @xmath86 . the absolute magnitude @xmath87 of the two ulpcs can be determined from the latest pw relation as given in @xcite : @xmath88 , with a dispersion of @xmath89 . since the pw relation is a statistical relation , the dispersion of this relation ( @xmath90 ) will dominate the error term of the derived distance modulus for individual ulpcs .",
    "hence , we have adopted the dispersion of the pw relation as the error in the calculated distance moduli for the two m31 ulpcs : @xmath91(8 - 0326 ) @xmath92  mag and @xmath91(8 - 1498 ) @xmath93  mag .",
    "since the weights for these two distance moduli are the same , taking an average of them reduces to the case of an unweighted mean .",
    "this procedure yielded @xmath4  mag , where the error on the averaged distance modulus is calculated using the small number statistics given in @xcite .",
    "the large error on the determined distance modulus is mainly due to the combination of small number statistics ( as there are only two ulpcs found in m31 ) and the large dispersion of the pw relation for ulpcs .",
    "g. fiorentino ( 2014 , private communication ) suggested using the pw relation derived from ulpcs in metal - rich galaxies ( hereafter metal - rich ulpcs ) .",
    "however , the sample of metal - rich ulpcs given in @xcite , i.e. those with @xmath94>8.4 $ ]  dex , only occupied a narrow range in @xmath95 .",
    "this causes the derived pw relation to be unreliable .",
    "instead , we have averaged the absolute wesenheit magnitudes for this sample of metal - rich ulpcs , yielding @xmath96  mag . using this absolute wesenheit magnitude , the derived distance modulus to m31 with our two ulpcs is @xmath97  mag with a ( unbiased ) standard deviation of @xmath98 .",
    "the value of this distance modulus is almost identical to the value recommended in @xcite .",
    "note that the sample of metal - poor ulpcs ( @xmath94<8.4 $ ]  dex ) in @xcite is the same as the sample given in @xcite .",
    "the derived distance modulus is @xmath99  mag when using the pw relation given in @xcite .",
    "the distance moduli derived using the pw relations given in @xcite and @xcite differed by @xmath100  mag , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "this reflects one of the current problems in using ulpcs to derive distances : the calibration of the ulpc pw relations is still uncertain with many discrepant results .",
    "the slope of the pw relation derived in @xcite , based on 18 ulpcs in metal - poor host galaxies , is essentially zero but with a large error ( @xmath101 ) .",
    "in contrast , the pw slope given in @xcite is @xmath102 ( though no error on the slope is quoted in their paper ) .",
    "the intercepts of these two period - wesenheit relations even displayed a larger difference : @xmath103 versus @xmath104 .",
    "the top panel in figure [ fig_comparepw ] compares these two pw relations , while the bottom panel of the same figure shows the difference of the derived distance modulus based on these two pw relations : this can be as large as @xmath105  mag .",
    "this disagreement between the two pw relations suggests more work is needed in the future to properly calibrate the ulpc pw relation . nevertheless , the distance modulus derived from the @xcite pw relation will be adopted in this work , because this period - wesenheit relation is derived from a larger sample of ulpcs than can be found in the literature .",
    "figure [ fig.m31 dm ] shows a comparison of the adopted distance modulus ( based on the two m31 ulpcs ) to other distance moduli given in literature .",
    "our calculated distance modulus is consistent with some of recent determinations , including the recommended value of @xmath106  mag @xcite .",
    "we note that the wesenheit magnitudes and the distance moduli for these two ulpcs differ by @xmath1  mag .",
    "this is not due to the `` depth effect , '' as one ulpc is located at the near - side and another ulpc is located at the far - side of m31 ( see figure [ fig.closeup ] ) .",
    "assuming the size of m31 is about 40  kpc , the maximum difference in distance modulus for two stars located at the two extreme edges is @xmath107  mag .",
    "this is @xmath108 smaller than the observed difference . instead",
    ", the observed @xmath1  mag difference in wesenheit magnitudes or distance moduli for these two ulpcs is consistent with the spread of @xmath87 at @xmath109 , as shown in right panel of figure [ fig.cmdpl ] ( or figure 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the expected spread of the pw relation ( @xmath110  mag ) .",
    "we believe this is due to their relative locations within the instability strip on the cmd , depending on their evolutionary status .",
    "figure [ fig_indgal ] compares the locations of the ulpcs in individual galaxies , as listed in @xcite , to the locations of the two m31 ulpcs in cmd and pwd .",
    "this shows that ulpcs in some galaxies ( such as ngc 3370 and ngc 3021 ) exhibit a similar spread in wesenheit magnitudes as in the case of the m31 ulpcs .",
    "the spread of wesenheit magnitudes , at a given period , can be expressed as @xmath111 , where @xmath112 and @xmath113 represent the range of magnitudes and colors , respectively , for ulpcs in the same galaxy .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath114 and a difference of @xmath115  mag could translate to a difference of @xmath116  mag , which is close to the observed spread of m31 ulpcs .",
    ", we found that @xmath117  mag and @xmath118  mag for the two m31 ulpcs yielding @xmath119  mag as observed . ]",
    "this implies that at a given period , the wesenheit magnitudes or distance moduli for the ulpcs can differ by as much as by @xmath1 magnitude .",
    "this calls into question the use of ulpcs as standard candles .",
    "in this work , we have presented the @xmath3-band follow - up observations of eight ulpc candidates in m31 . based on their light curve shapes and their locations on the cmd and pwd",
    ", we verified that two of the candidates are indeed ulpcs , and the remaining six candidates are not ulpcs ( and possibly belong to the lpv class ) .",
    "these six non - ulpc candidates also showed that other types of lpv could be mis - classified as ulpcs ( and vice versa ) if they have not had appropriate follow - up observations in the @xmath3-bands ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "we then used these two confirmed ulpcs to test their applicability in distance scale work by deriving the distance modulus to m31 .",
    "our derived distance modulus is consistent with the recommended value given in the literature , but with a large error of @xmath98  mag .",
    "we have demonstrated three problems when using ulpcs as a distance indicator .    1 .",
    "small number statistics : the number of ulpcs is expected to be small in a host galaxy ; hence , the ulpcs do not sample the instability strip well .",
    "the discrepancy between pw relations in the literature : the two available pw relations from @xcite and @xcite are in disagreement . as a result , the derived distance moduli can differ by as much as @xmath105  mag .",
    "the large dispersion of the pw relation : the current calibration of pw relation , defined as @xmath62 , for ulpcs still possesses a large dispersion compared to their shorter period counterparts ( which is @xmath120 smaller as shown in * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "furthermore , at a given period , the back - to - back scatter in the pwd can be as large as @xmath121  mag .    combining these three problems with currently available pw relations results in a less precise and accurate distance modulus . as mentioned in fiorentino s oral presentation ,",
    "ulpcs are not yet ready to be used as a standard candle .",
    "larger samples of ulpcs with well calibrated distance host galaxy distances are needed in order to derive a better pw relation ( with smaller @xmath90 ) before using ulpcs in `` one - step '' determinations of the hubble constant in the future .",
    "regardless of their potential or problems in future distance scale applications , ulpcs represent a unique probe for studies of stellar pulsation and evolution because they occupy the upper part of the instability strip that has attracted little attention to date .",
    "evolutionary tracks based on stellar evolution models appropriate for ulpcs have been explored in @xcite and @xcite and will not be repeated here . in figure",
    "[ fig_isochrone ] , we showed the isochrones adopted from @xcite on the cmd , suggesting that ulpcs are young objects as expected .",
    "nevertheless , detailed investigation of the evolutionary status for ulpcs with theoretical evolutionary tracks and isochrones is beyond the scope of this paper and will be addressed in future work .",
