    "bayesian networks  ( bn )  @xcite aid the reasoning and decision making in an uncertain environment .",
    "bn are built on top of a graphical model representing a set of random variables and their conditional independence .",
    "the learning phase in bn consists in retrieving the probabilities and the inference phase consists in computing the probabilities a posteriori by applying the bayes rules .",
    "bn are powerful in terms of inference , they are able to produce a decision pattern with very little information . very efficient",
    "algorithms exist for computing the probability a posteriori . + in the simplest bn model ,",
    "all the variables are only dependent on the inferring variable .",
    "this model is called nave bayes ( nb ) and it is successfully applied to several domains , providing satisfactory results .",
    "we are going to focus our solution on nave bayes because it must be implemented in resource - constrained devices .",
    "in particular , we use the model to infer two variables : the condition of the network and the effectiveness of the bid .",
    "+ we use both the variables to find the best strategy by applying a linear programming  @xcite technique to maximize the gain and minimize the risk .",
    "since the network is dynamic , we have to evaluate the stability of the path to where we would like to route the packet .",
    "we use the information about the entire topology , provided and kept constantly updated by the olsr  @xcite protocol , to train our nave bayes model and , consequently , evaluate the stability .",
    "+ we define @xmath0 as the set of nodes in the network .",
    "we assume @xmath1 is the event that our device is able to communicate with @xmath2 .",
    "then , we compute @xmath3 by recording , from the topology information , the number of times @xmath4 is reachable divided by the size of the sample . +",
    "the next step consists in computing the following variables :    * let @xmath5 be the set of one - hop neighbors , @xmath6 is the probability of using the neighbor @xmath7 for forwarding the packet , the probability is computed by looking into the topology provided by olsr . * let @xmath8 be a random variable expressing the number of hops needed to reach the destination , @xmath9 is the probability of sending the packet through a certain number of hops subjected to the fact that the packet successfully comes to the destination , this is used to evaluate the stability of the path depending on the number of necessary hops .    inferring the quality of the network consist in inferring @xmath10 for all the nodes that offer the possibility to relay the message .",
    "we compute the inference by applying the bayes rule .",
    "@xmath11 in particular , we use equation  [ eq1 ] to evaluate the probability of success in forwarding the message through all the neighbors devices . then , we will use the results for the bid decision .",
    "we proceed in the same way as we have done in the previous subsection .",
    "we assume that we know the following information .",
    "* @xmath12 is the timeout time ( where @xmath13 is the maximum allowed timeout ) * @xmath14 is the budget required from the bid ( where @xmath15 is the maximum allowed budget ) * @xmath16 is the final destination of the message .",
    "we define the following variables :    * let @xmath17 be the event of having a gain in the bid process , we compute the success by using the feedbacks provided by the maniac challenge 2013  @xcite framework .",
    "* let @xmath18 be the function that defines how much we can remove from @xmath19 in the offer we are proposing to the device who needs to forward the message .",
    "* let @xmath20 be the function that express our gain over @xmath19 .    with the variables",
    "previously stated we compute the following probabilities :    * @xmath21 is the probability of having a certain timeout subjected to the success .",
    "* @xmath22 is the probability of remove a certain amount over @xmath19 subjected to having success in the bid .",
    "* @xmath23 is the probability that we keep for us a certain amount of @xmath19 subjected to having success in the bid .",
    "* @xmath24 is the probability of having a final destination @xmath25 subjected on having success .    following the method mentioned in the equation  [ eq1 ] we can compute the probability of success in the auction using equation  [ eq2 ] .",
    "@xmath26      the strategy is based on maximizing the gain and the probability of success , and minimizing the costs .",
    "so , we use the following linear programming expression ( the value of @xmath25 is given in the information we receive from the bid requester ) .",
    "@xmath27 where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the thresholds needed for evaluating the scenario .",
    "+ the linear programming expression previously shown could be easily solved with a local search procedure thanks to the small dimension of the search space . + in the case the linear programming expression does not return a feasible solution , the only action we can do consists in proposing a bid to forward the message via the wired backbone at the maximum price .",
    "compared to other strategies bmaniac does not reach the desired results .    the first issue we found stands in the time needed to the learning phase , bmanic requires a priori set of sampling in order to retrieve the best inference and find a suitable solution .",
    "during the challenge the session times were too short to obtain enough sampling to achieve a good inference .",
    "moreover , we believe that another possible explanation bmanic achieve poor results is in the fact that it tries to adapt his behavior depending on the offers coming from other devices instead to push them to modify their behavior .",
    "we argue that bmaniac could be easily adapted to different domains where cooperation is the centerpiece and it might reach good and fair results .",
    "our proposed solution for the maniac challenge 2013 is a heterogeneous algorithm based on both linear programming technique and bayesian statistics .",
    "it is able to define a strategy for data offloading , which will provide good results in a cooperative environment with long lasting installations .",
