    "the quantum field theory in curved space - time has been a matter of great interest in recent years because of its applications to cosmology and astrophysics .",
    "the evidence of existence of strong gravitational fields in our universe led to the study of the quantum effects of material fields in external classical gravitational field .",
    "after the appearance of parker s paper on scalar fields  @xcite and spin-@xmath1 fields ,  @xcite several authors have studied this subject . although the universe seems homogenous and isotropic at present , there are no observational data guarantying the isotropy in the era prior to the recombination .",
    "in fact , there are theoretical arguments that sustain the existence of an anisotropic phase that approaches an isotropic one  @xcite .",
    "interest in studying klein - gordon and dirac equations in anisotropic models has increased since hu and parker  @xcite have shown that the creation of scalar particles in anisotropic backgrounds can dissipate the anisotropy as the universe expands .    a bianchi type - i ( b - i ) universe , being the straightforward generalization of the flat robertson - walker ( rw ) universe , is one of the simplest models of an anisotropic universe that describes a homogenous and spatially flat universe . unlike the rw universe which has the same scale factor for each of the three spatial directions , a b - i universe has a different scale factor in each direction , thereby introducing an anisotropy to the system .",
    "it moreover has the agreeable property that near the singularity it behaves like a kasner universe , even in the presence of matter , and consequently falls within the general analysis of the singularity given by belinskii et al  @xcite .",
    "also in a universe filled with matter for @xmath2 , it has been shown that any initial anisotropy in a b - i universe quickly dies away and a b - i universe eventually evolves into a rw universe  @xcite .",
    "since the present - day universe is surprisingly isotropic , this feature of the b - i universe makes it a prime candidate for studying the possible effects of an anisotropy in the early universe on present - day observations . in light of the importance of",
    "mentioned above , several authors have studied linear spinor field equations  @xcite and the behavior of gravitational waves ( gw s )  @xcite in a b - i universe .",
    "nonlinear spinor field ( nlsf ) in external cosmological gravitational field was first studied by g.n .",
    "shikin in 1991  @xcite .",
    "this study was extended by us for the more general case where we consider the nonlinear term as an arbitrary function of all possible invariants generated from spinor bilinear forms . in that paper",
    "we also studied the possibility of elimination of initial singularity especially for the kasner universe  @xcite . for few years we studied the behavior of self - consistent nlsf in",
    "a b - i universe  @xcite both in presence of perfect fluid and without it that was followed by the refs .",
    ",  @xcite where we studied the self - consistent system of interacting spinor and scalar fields .",
    "the purpose of the paper is to study the role of the cosmological constant ( @xmath0 ) in the lagrangian which together with newton s gravitational constant ( @xmath3 ) is considered as the fundamental constants in einstein s theory of gravity  @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian for the self - consistent system of spinor and gravitational fields can be written as @xmath4 - m{\\bar \\psi}\\psi + l_n , \\label{lag}\\ ] ] with @xmath5- being the scalar curvature , @xmath6- being the einstein s gravitational constant .",
    "the nonlinear term @xmath7 describes the self - interaction of a spinor field and in this particular case is chosen as an arbitrary function of @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath9 .    variation of ( [ lag ] ) with respect to spinor field gives nonlinear dirac equations    [ speq ] @xmath10    with @xmath11 , whereas variation of ( [ lag ] ) with respect to metric tensor @xmath12 gives the einstein s field equation @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the ricci tensor ; @xmath15 is the ricci scalar ; and @xmath16 is the energy - momentum tensor of matter field defined as @xmath17 @xmath18 with respect to ( [ speq ] ) takes the form @xmath19    in ( [ speq ] ) and ( [ tem ] ) @xmath20 denotes the covariant derivative of spinor , having the form  @xcite @xmath21 where @xmath22 are spinor affine connection matrices . @xmath23",
    "matrices in the above equations are connected with the flat space - time dirac matrices @xmath24 in the following way @xmath25 where @xmath26 and @xmath27 is a set of tetrad 4-vectors .",
    "let us now choose bianchi type - i space - time in the form  @xcite @xmath28 with @xmath29 and @xmath30 being the functions of @xmath31 only",
    ".    for the space - time ( [ bi ] ) einstein equations ( [ ee ] ) now read    [ bid ] @xmath32    where point means differentiation with respect to t.    from @xmath33 one finds @xmath34 flat space - time matrices @xmath24 we will choose in the form , given in  @xcite .",
    "we will study the space - independent solutions to spinor field equation ( 7 ) so that @xmath35 setting @xmath36 in this case equation ( [ speq1 ] ) we write as @xmath37 further putting @xmath38 from ( [ spq ] ) one deduces the following system of equations :    [ v ] @xmath39    from ( [ v ] ) one easily obtains @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the constants of integration .    from ( [ spq ] ) we will also find the equation for bilinear spinor form @xmath43 : @xmath44 with the solution @xmath45 where @xmath46 is the constant of integration .",
    "as one can see the constants @xmath46 and @xmath42 are connected with each other as @xmath47    putting ( [ st ] ) into ( [ tem ] ) , we obtain the following expressions for the components of the energy - momentum tensor @xmath48 from ( [ temc ] ) in view of ( [ st ] ) it is obvious that for the linear spinor field @xmath49 the sign of @xmath46 is defined from the requirement of positivity of energy density @xmath50 of linear spinor field . hence , from ( [ temcl ] ) emerges @xmath51 in view of ( [ temc ] ) from ( [ bid ] ) we derive  @xcite    [ abc ] @xmath52 , \\label{a } \\\\",

    "as one sees , both spinor field and metric functions are in some functional dependent on @xmath54 .",
    "let us define the equation for @xmath54 .",
    "summation of einstein equations ( [ 11 ] ) , ( [ 22]),([33 ] ) and ( [ 00 ] ) multiplied by 3 gives @xmath55 the right - hand - side of ( [ dtau ] ) is a function of @xmath54 only , namely @xmath56 the solution to this equation is well - known for any arbitrary function @xmath57  @xcite and can be written in quadrature @xmath58 where @xmath59 is some constant that can be set zero . given the explicit form of the nonlinear term @xmath60 from ( [ quadra ] ) one finds the concrete solution for @xmath54 .",
    "thus the initial systems of einstein and dirac equations have been completely integrated .",
    "in this section we shall analyze the general results obtained in the previous section for concrete nonlinear term .",

    "* @xmath68 , @xmath69 . in this case for @xmath70 and @xmath71",
    "we find @xmath72 thus we see that the asymptotic behavior of @xmath54 does not depend on @xmath73 and defined by @xmath0 - term . from ( [ abc ] )",
    "it is obvious that the asymptotic isotropization takes place .",
    "from ( [ quadrature ] ) it also follows that @xmath54 can not be zero at any moment , since the intigrant turns out to be imaginary as @xmath54 approaches to zero .",
    "thus the solution obtained is a nonsingular one thanks to the nonlinear term in the dirac equation and asymptotically isotropic .",
    "let us go back to the energy density of spinor field . from @xmath74 follows that at @xmath75 the energy density of spinor field becomes negative , which means that the absence of initial singularity in the considered cosmological solution appears to be consistent with the violation of the dominant energy condition in the hawking - penrose theorem  @xcite , since in this case @xmath76 consider the linear case with @xmath77 . then from ( [ quadrature ] ) follows @xmath78 as one sees @xmath79 that coincides with ( [ c1 ] ) . from ( [ tl0 ] )",
