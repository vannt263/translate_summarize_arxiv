    "the compelling scientific goals of future high energy physics experiments are a driving factor in the development of advanced detector technologies . with many fundamental issues within the experimental reach at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) , a large @xmath0 effort was devoted to the optimization of existing devices and the development of innovative concepts for radiation detection .",
    "all four major lhc experiments ( atlas , cms , alice and lhcb ) will extensively use gas detectors , depending on the need for trigger and bunch crossing tagging ( gem , resistive plate chambers , thin gap chambers ) , high - rate tracking and particle identification ( straw - type detectors , time projection chamber , drift tubes , cathode strip chambers ) and single photon detection ( multi - wire proportional chamber with csi photocathodes ) . in future colliders ,",
    "gaseous detectors are planned to be used at the ten times higher luminosity upgrade of lhc ( the so - called superlhc or slhc ) or at the foreseen international linear collider ( ilc ) .",
    "the related @xmath0 challenges come on one hand from the development of radiation - hard detector concepts and high granularity readout and on the other hand from the need for ultra - high - precision tracking with minimum material budget .    within the broad family of different gas detector technologies , two innovative mpgd concepts , gem and micromegas ,",
    "have now reached maturity and play a prominent role in modern hep experiments .",
    "their attractive properties such as excellent spatial resolution , fast signal response , low radiation length and high rate capability combined with radiation hardness , motivate their use at the future slhc and ilc colliders .",
    "there are many common issues to be addressed at the next generation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 machines , necessitating more fundamental @xmath0 in the field of micro - pattern devices , which would be beneficial for both communities .",
    "this paper reviews recent advances of gem and micromegas detectors , with a focus on design principles , performance , and operational experience , and discusses the most promising directions in future developments and applications .",
    "the development of modern lhc detectors presented formidable challenges , which are at the same time of great technological , engineering and organizational complexity .",
    "typical time - scales have stretched over 20 years starting from the concept , progressing through intensive @xmath3 , design and prototyping , mass production , installation and finally system integration and commissioning .",
    "these detectors are not just bigger versions of currently running experiments ; several new issues had to be addressed during their construction :    * radiation hardness at extremely high radiation levels ; * intrinsic performance of innovative detector technologies integrated into large systems at the physics frontier ; * a coherent and system oriented approach from the @xmath0 phase to commissioning , including many - year - long strong partnership with industry ; * sub - detector systems become so large and complex that their construction has to be shared around the world .    the lhc gaseous detectors will not be reviewed in this paper ; they are covered in a number of dedicated articles  @xcite .",
    "although achieving the intrinsic performance in the lab captures most of experimenter s attention , the complexity of the overall system approach remains the area where most systems experience major setbacks .",
    "understanding of all system aspects should be a focus of vigorous @xmath0 to develop common solutions for upgraded and new experiments .",
    "the commissioning of the lhc experiments is about to reach a successful completion over the coming year . using the atlas muon spectrometer as an example of a modern gaseous detector ,",
    "the main challenges of achieving the intrinsic performance in a large system using standard wire chamber technology are discussed .",
    "the atlas muon spectrometer has been designed for standalone tracking with a momentum resolution of 2.5@xmath4 for transverse momenta up to 250  gev ( limited by multiple scattering ) and better than 10@xmath4 up to 1  tev ( limited by the muon chamber measurement accuracy )  @xcite .",

    "the presence of slow - moving ions from electron avalanches generates a positive space charge in the drift tube , which modifies the electric field and leads to an uncertainty in the space - to - drift - time relation .",

    "the mdt chambers are constructed from 2@xmath93 monolayers of drift tubes , glued on either side of a rigid support structure .",
    "the high accuracy of the standalone measurement puts stringent demands on the mechanical precision of the sense wire location ( 20  @xmath6 ) .",

    "therefore , at least 200 space points with an average transverse resolution of 100  @xmath6 have to be measured over a maximum drift length of 250  cm in a 4  t field , and a multi - track separation of 1  mm has to be reached .",

    "an elegant solution is to use a cmos pixel chip assembled directly below the gem or micromegas amplification structure and serving as an integrated charge collecting anode . with this arrangement avalanche electrons",
