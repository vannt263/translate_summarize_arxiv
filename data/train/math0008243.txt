    "random domino tilings of finite regions often exhibit surprising statistical heterogeneity .",
    "such heterogeneity would be expected in the vicinity of the boundary , but in fact the presence of a boundary can make its influence felt well into the interior of the region .",
    "the research that led to this article is part of an ongoing effort to understand this phenomenon .",
    "the results proved here are the first to give a precise description of how local statistics for domino tilings can vary continuously throughout a region in response to the imposition of specific boundary conditions .",
    "those who study random tilings of finite regions ( in the plane ) by dominos have tended to focus on regions that are rectangles of even area . in particular ,",
    "burton and pemantle @xcite have done an intensive analysis of the small - scale structure of such tilings .",
    "their work shows that once one gets away from the boundary of the rectangle , random tilings tend to exhibit statistical isotropy . among all random processes that take their values in the set of domino tilings of the plane ,",
    "the burton - pemantle process has maximal entropy , and it is unique in this regard ; for this reason alone , it is worth further study .",
    "however , if one looks at random domino tilings of tileable finite regions in general , one finds that local behavior far from the boundary need not be governed by maximal entropy statistics , but can look very different .",
    "moreover , the local behavior seen in one part of the region is in general different from local behaviors seen elsewhere .",
    "one especially tractable proving ground for the study of this statistical heterogeneity has been the family of finite regions known as aztec diamonds , introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - aztec ] shows an aztec diamond of order 64 tiled randomly by dominos . in general , the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 can be defined as the union of those lattice squares whose interiors lie inside the region @xmath1 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite ( and will be proved in subsection  [ ssec - act ]  by different methods ) that , asymptotically , the circle inscribed in the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 serves as a boundary between domains of qualitatively different behavior .",
    "we call this circle the arctic circle , because , as one can see from figure  [ fig - aztec ] , the dominos outside the arctic circle are frozen into a brickwork pattern . to state the theorem",
    "more precisely , we impose a checkerboard coloring on the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 , so that the leftmost square in each row in the top half of the diamond is white .",
    "we say a horizontal domino is _ north - going _ or _ south - going _ according to whether its leftmost square is white or black , and we say a vertical domino is _ west - going _ or _ east - going _ according to whether its upper",
    "square is white or black .",
    "( the motivation for this terminology comes from the `` domino shuffling '' algorithm introduced in @xcite and used in both @xcite and @xcite ; this algorithm permits one to generate random domino tilings of aztec diamonds in such a way that every possible tiling has the same probability of arising as every other , and indeed it was this algorithm that we used to generate the tiling shown in figure  [ fig - aztec ] . )    say that two dominos are adjacent if they share an edge ( i.e. , their boundaries overlap on a segment of length @xmath2 or more ) , and say that a domino is adjacent to the boundary of the aztec diamond if it shares an edge with the boundary .",
    "we define the _ north polar region _ as the union of those north - going dominos that are each connected to the boundary by a sequence of adjacent north - going dominos .",
    "the south , west , and east polar regions are defined similarly , and the _ temperate zone _ is the union of those dominos that belong to none of the four polar regions .    the arctic circle theorem of @xcite states that for every @xmath3 , if one takes @xmath0 sufficiently large , then for all but an @xmath4 fraction of the domino tilings of the diamond of order @xmath0 , the border of the temperate zone stays within distance @xmath5 of the circle of radius @xmath6 with center @xmath7 .",
    "in particular , this implies that if one increases the radius of the circle by @xmath5 , then with probability greater than @xmath8 , in each of the four regions in the aztec diamond that lie outside the enlarged disk , all dominos are aligned with their neighbors in brickwork patterns .",
    "the theorem also implies that if one decreases the radius of the disk by @xmath5 , then within the shrunken disk dominos with different orientations are in some sense interspersed among one another ( with probability greater than @xmath8 ) ; however , the theorem by itself gives no information on their distribution .",
    "in theorem  [ main ] of this article we will give a quantitative analysis of the behavior of random tilings in the inner , disorderly zone .",
    "in particular , we will give an asymptotic formula for the proportion of domino tilings of the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 that contain a domino at a specified location , i.e. , the _ placement probability _ for that location .",
    "this formula depends only on the orientation of the domino , its parity relative to the natural checkerboard coloring of the aztec diamond , and the relative position of the domino within the aztec diamond ( in normalized coordinates ) .",
    "one consequence of our formula is that random domino tilings exhibit `` total statistical heterogeneity '' within the central zone .",
    "that is to say , any two patches within the temperate zone that are macroscopically separated ( i.e. , separated by a distance on the order of @xmath0 ) will exhibit distinct statistics .",
    "( for a precise statement , see subsection  [ ssec - heterogeneity ] . )",
    "our work builds on the generating functions derived in @xcite .",
    "one of them is a rational function in three variables whose coefficients are the placement probabilities for which an asymptotic formula is sought .",
    "the authors of the earlier article carried out a relatively straightforward complex integration to calculate coefficients corresponding to dominos in the @xmath9 block in the middle of the aztec diamond ; the resulting exact formula implies that in a diamond of order @xmath0 , these placement probabilities are @xmath10 . in the present article",
    "we will apply the saddle point method to estimate contour integrals associated with more general coefficients of a related generating function ( also derived in @xcite ) .",
    "we can now prepare to state our main result .",
    "we call the union of two adjacent squares in the aztec diamond a _ domino space _ , to avoid confusion between actual dominos occurring in a particular tiling and the locations in which dominos can occur .",
    "domino spaces are classified as north - going , south - going , west - going , or east - going in the obvious way , so that for instance a domino is north - going if and only if it occupies a north - going domino space .",
    "because of symmetry , we lose no generality by focusing on the placement probabilities associated with north - going domino spaces .",
    "the midpoint of the bottom edge of each north - going domino space is some point @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "we call this the _ location _ of the north - going domino space . normalizing by dividing by @xmath0 , we obtain some point @xmath13 with @xmath14 .",
    "we call this the _ normalized location _ of the north - going domino space .",
    "[ main ] let @xmath15 be an open set containing the points @xmath16 .",
    "if @xmath13 is the normalized location of a north - going domino space in the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 , and @xmath17 , then , as @xmath18 , the placement probability at @xmath13 is within @xmath19 of @xmath20 , where @xmath21 the @xmath19 error bound is uniform in @xmath13 ( for @xmath17 ) .    similarly , the south - going , east - going , and west - going placement probabilities near @xmath13 are approximated by @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 , respectively",
    "this follows from theorem  [ main ] by rotational symmetry .",
    "the organization of the rest of this article is as follows .    in the remainder of section  [ sec - introduction ] , we discuss some qualitative features of the main theorem and give some preliminaries for the proof . in section  [ sec - creation ] , we use the saddle point method to derive asymptotic estimates for certain numbers known as creation rates , which give placement probabilities when summed appropriately . in section",
    "[ sec - placement ] , we use this result to estimate , modulo an error term , the north - going placement probabilities . in section  [ sec - exponential ] ,",
    "we use techniques from the theory of exponential sums to justify our bound for the error term .",
    "this completes the proof of the theorem away from the boundary of the diamond ; section  [ sec - conclusion ]  provides the final arguments that handle locations near the boundary .",
    "section  [ sec - consequences ]  discusses some consequences of the theorem .",
    "in particular , by taking a detour through the theory of domino tilings in general , we show that some consequences of the arctangent formula apply not only to the particular shape we call the aztec diamond but also to slightly deformed versions of this shape ( proposition  [ robustness ] ) .",
    "we also give a new proof of the arctic circle theorem and a large deviation estimate for certain properties of random tilings of simply - connected finite regions ( theorem  [ variancethm ] and proposition  [ large ] ) .",
    "section  [ sec - further ]  briefly sketches how the method of proof of theorem  [ main ] can be adapted to handle the more general case of random domino tilings when there is a bias in favor of one domino orientation over the other ( horizontal versus vertical ) .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec - speculations ]  with speculations and open questions .    for a treatment of the probabilistic preliminaries needed for section  [ sec - consequences ] , see @xcite .      as a first comment on the qualitative features of this formula , we point out the continuity of the formula for @xmath20 ( except at @xmath25 ) . indeed ,",
    "if we had been so naive as to ask for an asymptotic formula for the placement probabilities for _ all _ horizontal domino spaces in an asymptotically small patch of the aztec diamond ( south - going as well as north - going ) , we would not get a single value at all but rather a pair of values , namely @xmath20 and @xmath22 , which are not in general equal .",
    "that is , the local statistics are not even approximately invariant under translations that exchange the two color - classes .",
    "it is therefore all the more pleasant that the local statistics are asymptotically invariant under translations that preserve the two color - classes ( at least , they are invariant if , in discussing local statistics , we confine ourselves to placement probabilities , and do not inquire about correlations between placements ) .",
    "another important feature of the formula is the singular behavior that occurs near the normalized locations @xmath26 , which we can explain as follows . in @xcite",
    "it is shown that the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 has exactly @xmath27 domino tilings , and a formula derived in that article ( formula  ( 7 ) of section  4 ) can be used to show that for @xmath28 , exactly @xmath29 of the tilings have horizontal dominos covering the leftmost squares in the first @xmath30 rows from the top and have vertical dominos covering the leftmost squares in the next @xmath31 rows . thus , the placement probability associated with the leftmost north - going domino space in the @xmath30th row is exactly the sum @xmath32 this sum is very close to 1 for @xmath33 and very close to 0 for @xmath34 ; macroscopically speaking , the placement probability jumps from 1 to 0 discontinuously",
    ". it might be possible to analyze the limiting behavior of the placement probabilities in the vicinity of the singularities under suitable scaling , but we do not explore this possibility here .",
    "an easily - understood symmetry property of @xmath35 is the fact that @xmath36 this is a consequence of the fact that reflecting a domino tiling through the line @xmath37 carries north - going domino spaces to north - going domino spaces .",
    "a further identity satisfied by @xmath38 is the relation @xmath39 to see why this is true , one need only observe that the four domino spaces that contain a particular lattice square ( fewer , if the square is on the boundary ) must have placement probabilities that sum to 1 .",
    "a subtler consequence of theorem  [ main ] is the fact that the level sets of @xmath20 ( for probabilities strictly between 0 and 1 ) are arcs of ellipses .",
    "more specifically , for @xmath40 the level set @xmath41 and the level set @xmath42 , together with the singular points @xmath43 , form an ellipse tangent to the boundary of the diamond at the two singular points . as @xmath44 ( or @xmath45 ) , the ellipse becomes the inscribed circle , which is the zero - set of the function @xmath46 ; in the case @xmath47 , the ellipse degenerates into the line segment joining the two singular points , which is the part of the zero - set of the function @xmath48 lying inside the aztec diamond ; and in general , the ellipse will be the zero - set of some convex combination of @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "the point @xmath7 lies on the level set @xmath49 , which is an arc of an ellipse ; the complementary arc of the ellipse is the level set @xmath50 , and the point on this arc opposite @xmath7 is the point @xmath51 .",
    "the situation is depicted schematically in figure  [ fig - ellipses ] .",
    "recall that , under the original ( unnormalized ) coordinate system , each north - going domino space in an aztec diamond of order @xmath0 is assigned some location @xmath11 with @xmath12 .",
    "it is easy to check that @xmath52 must have the same parity as @xmath53 .",
    "define @xmath54 as the probability that a random domino tiling of the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 will have a domino occupying the north - going domino space at location @xmath11 ; for @xmath55 , or @xmath56 , define @xmath57 .",
    "for instance , we have @xmath58 , @xmath59 , and @xmath60 .",
    "define @xmath61 this quantity is called the _ net creation rate _ at location @xmath11 , but the reason for this name and the interpretation of the quantity in terms of domino shuffling are not needed for our purposes .",
    "( for the motivation , see @xcite . )    define @xmath62 to be the coefficient of @xmath63 in @xmath64 .",
    "( note that @xmath62 is the krawtchouk polynomial @xmath65 evaluated at @xmath66 .",
    "for information about krawtchouk polynomials , see @xcite . )",
    "our proof of theorem  [ main ] will be based on the following result from @xcite :    [ gessel ] let @xmath67 .",
    "suppose @xmath68 and @xmath69 are integers with @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "if we let @xmath72 and @xmath73 , then @xmath74 for other integers @xmath68 and @xmath69 , we have @xmath75 .",
    "this proposition implies that the creation rates are non - negative , if we use the identity @xmath76 .",
    "( this identity is a standard fact about krawtchouk polynomials , and follows immediately from theorem  17 on page  152 of @xcite . )",
    "when combined with proposition  [ gessel ] , the identity implies that @xmath77 is a positive factor times the square of a krawtchouk polynomial , and hence that @xmath78 . note that this inequality , together with ( [ creation ] )",
    ", yields @xmath79 for @xmath80 by induction on @xmath81 .",
    "we will also need the following result on exponential sums .",
    "[ kusmin - landau ] let @xmath82 denote the distance to the nearest integer , @xmath83 be an interval , and @xmath84 be a real - valued function on @xmath83 .",
    "if @xmath84 is continuously differentiable , @xmath85 is monotonic , and @xmath86 on @xmath83 , then @xmath87 the constant implicit in the @xmath88 term does not depend on @xmath83 .",
    "a proof can be found in @xcite .",
    "we begin the proof of theorem  [ main ] by using ( [ creation ] ) to write the placement probabilities as sums of creation rates , which gives the formula @xmath89 ( note that the remark after proposition  [ gessel ] shows that , as claimed in the abstract , this is a weighted sum of squares of krawtchouk polynomials . ) we will estimate the creation rates , and then use our estimate to prove the asymptotic formula for the placement probabilities .    because of proposition  [ gessel ] , to estimate the creation rates it suffices to approximate the coefficients of the polynomials @xmath64 . to do this , we write the coefficients as contour integrals in the usual way , and then apply the saddle point method to these integrals .",
    "sufficiently far outside the arctic circle , this method shows that the creation rates are exponentially small in @xmath0 ( proposition  [ expsmall ] ) ; sufficiently far inside , it approximates them by a well - behaved function times an oscillating factor ( proposition  [ crest ] ) . with additional work",
    ", it might be possible to obtain a uniform estimate over the entire aztec diamond , but we can make do with just these estimates .",
    "we would then like to substitute our creation rate estimates into ( [ crsum ] ) and convert the sum to an integral to determine its asymptotics .",
    "if we are willing to be unrigorous , we can wishfully replace the oscillatory cosine - squared factor in proposition  [ crest ] by its mean value @xmath90 , obtaining ( for locations inside the inscribed circle ) @xmath91 where @xmath92 is the larger of the two roots of the equation @xmath93 , @xmath94 , and @xmath95 ; we truncate the sum and integral at @xmath96 on the supposition ( to be discussed in the next paragraph ) that essentially no creation occurs outside the arctic circle . to make this argument rigorous",
    ", we need to deal honestly with the oscillating factor in the creation rate estimate inside the arctic circle , and we need to circumvent the non - uniformity of our estimates .    the non - uniformity of the estimates can be dealt with simply by summing over a smaller interval than in ( [ crsum ] ) .",
    "the exponentially small bounds on the creation rates outside the arctic circle show that the terms in ( [ crsum ] ) that come from locations outside the arctic circle contribute very little to the sum .",
    "motivated by this , we look at the sum of all the terms that come from locations that are far enough inside the arctic circle that our creation rate estimates from proposition  [ crest ] apply . because the creation rates are all non - negative , this new sum underestimates the placement probability .",
    "dealing appropriately with the oscillating factor ( as described below ) gives an estimate for the new sum ; as we see in the computation above , this estimate turns out to be the arctangent formula from theorem  [ main ] .",
    "a short argument shows that the placement probabilities can be no larger asymptotically ( proposition  [ maininside ] ) , and because our estimate is an underestimate we know they can be no smaller .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "( actually , this method works only away from the edges of the diamond , so it is not until section  [ sec - conclusion ]  that the proof is completed . )    all that remains is to describe how to deal with the oscillating factor in the summand .",
    "we must show that replacing the oscillating factor by its average value has an asymptotically negligible effect on the sum .",
    "equivalently , we must show that the difference between the original sum and the smoothed sum is small .",
    "this difference is an exponential sum , and we can estimate it using the kusmin - landau theorem once some preparatory results ( lemmas  [ phase ] , [ algebraic ] , and [ algroots ] ) are in place .",
    "our proof of the asymptotic formula for placement probabilities begins with an estimate of creation rates , which is proved using the saddle point method .",
    "because proposition  [ gessel ] is most conveniently stated for an aztec diamond of order @xmath97 , we will estimate the creation rates in an aztec diamond of order @xmath97 . from this point on , we assume that @xmath98 , because otherwise @xmath77 is necessarily @xmath99 .",
    "as pointed out in subsection  [ ssec - outline ] , the creation rates behave differently inside and outside the inscribed circle .",
    "if we estimate the creation rates inside it , we get the following result :    [ crest ] fix @xmath3 . if @xmath100 and @xmath98 , then @xmath101 for some function @xmath102 , which we determine explicitly below .",
    "the subscript in @xmath103 indicates that the implicit constant depends on @xmath4 . in this paper , if any subscripts appear on a big @xmath104 term , then the implicit constant depends only on the indicated variables , but the absence of subscripts should not be taken to imply that the implicit constant is absolute .",
    "let @xmath105 where @xmath106 and @xmath66 are defined as in the statement of proposition  [ gessel ] . to approximate the creation rate ,",

    "it follows that if one travels around the boundary of the region counterclockwise , then one will see a black square on one s left half the time and a white square on one s left half the time ; to see why , notice that the edges of the square grid that lie within the region pair sides of black squares with sides of white squares , so the excess of unpaired ( i.e. , boundary ) sides of black squares over unpaired sides of white squares is four times the excess of black squares over white squares .",
    "as one travels around the boundary , any temporary excess of one kind of square over the other that is observed along the way represents a `` debt '' that will eventually have to be paid .",
    "moreover , the same is true simultaneously for all the boundaries of all the simply - connected regions that are formed by suitable subsets of the tiles in question .",
    "height functions provide a uniform framework for keeping track of all these debts simultaneously .",
    "if @xmath253 denotes a finite , simply - connected region composed of lattice squares that have been alternately colored black and white , a _ height function _ on @xmath253 is an integer - valued function @xmath81 on the vertices of the lattice squares which satisfies the following two properties for adjacent vertices @xmath114 and @xmath115 : first , if the edge from @xmath114 to @xmath115 is part of the boundary of @xmath253 , then @xmath443 , and second , if the edge from @xmath114 to @xmath115 has a black square on its left , then @xmath444 is either @xmath445 or @xmath446 .",
    "it is not hard to show that such a function necessarily satisfies a discrete lipschitz condition : if vertices @xmath114 and @xmath115 are at distance @xmath447 from each other in the sup - norm , then @xmath448 . note",
    "also that if @xmath449 is a height function , then so is @xmath450 for any integer @xmath451 .",
    "every height function on @xmath253 determines a domino tiling of @xmath253 , consisting of dominos that occupy all the domino spaces that are bisected by edges @xmath271 with the property that @xmath452 .",
    "conversely , every domino tiling of @xmath253 arises in this way from a height function on @xmath253 that is unique modulo addition of a global constant .",
    "we can remove this ambiguity by constraining a particular vertex on the boundary of @xmath253 to have some particular integer value as its height ; then every domino tiling of @xmath253 has a unique height function subject to this constraint , and what is more , all these height functions agree with one another on the boundary of @xmath253 .",
    "for instance , in the case of the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 , we set things up so that the middle vertex on the west edge of the diamond has height 0 and the middle vertex on the northern edge has height @xmath453 .",
    "( note that this differs by 1 from the height function convention used in @xcite . )",
    "then the heights for a typical domino tiling of an aztec diamond are as shown in figure  [ fig - typical ] .",
    "( the shading convention for the lattice squares is the same as that in section  [ sec - introduction ] , i.e. , so that the leftmost square of each row in the top half of the diamond is white . )",
    "one can also develop an analogous theory of height functions for other sorts of tilings , for example , tilings of regions in the triangular lattice by lozenges ( two unit equilateral triangles joined along an edge ) .",
    "this theory is simpler geometrically than that for domino tilings ; for the details , see @xcite .",
    "( see also @xcite for an independent , earlier development of height functions for this lattice in physics . )",
    "height functions can furthermore be applied to the square ice model studied by lieb , as is shown in @xcite .",
    "the results of subsections  [ ssec - robustness ] and [ ssec - variance ] generalize straightforwardly to other sorts of height functions .",
    "however , because the focus of this article is on domino tilings , we will not go into the details of the generalization .",
    "suppose @xmath114 , @xmath115 , and @xmath454 are three consecutive vertices along a path in a simply - connected region @xmath253 that is tiled by dominos , such that neither the edge @xmath271 nor the edge @xmath455 bisects a domino .",
    "then @xmath456 , with @xmath457 if the three points are collinear and @xmath458 if they are not .",
    "this principle makes it fairly easy to go through the tiling , assigning heights to the vertices .",
    "alternatively , one can use this method just to find the heights along the boundary , and then find the heights in the interior by the following procedure . to determine the height of a particular vertex in the interior of a tiled region , start at the point on the boundary of the region due north of the vertex (",
    "whose height is independent of the tiling ) and proceed downward , subject to the following rule : when one travels southward along an edge that bisects a north - going ( resp .",
    "south - going ) domino in the tiling , the height decreases ( resp .",
    "increases ) by 3 , whereas , when one travels southward along an edge that bisects a north - going ( resp .",
    "south - going ) domino space that is not occupied by a domino in the tiling , the tiling , the height increases ( resp .",
    "decreases ) by 1 .",
    "a similar rule can be formulated for describing how the height changes as one travels horizontally through the interior of the diamond .",
    "the fact that these rules are consistent with each other is a consequence of the fact that any region that can be tiled by dominos must contain exactly equal numbers of black and white squares .",
    "if we take the average of all the ( finitely many ) height functions associated with the different tilings of a region , we get a real - valued function on the vertices called the _ average height function_. as a consequence of the rule described in the preceding paragraph , one can give a simple description of how the average height changes from vertex to vertex , in terms of the placement probability @xmath459 associated with the domino space that is bisected by the edge that connects the two vertices .",
    "for instance , if @xmath114 and @xmath115 are neighbors , with @xmath114 to the north or west of @xmath115 , then the average height at @xmath115 is equal to the average height at @xmath114 plus @xmath460 if edge @xmath271 bisects a south - going or west - going domino space , while the average height at @xmath115 is equal to the average height at @xmath114 minus @xmath460 if edge @xmath271 bisects a north - going or east - going domino space .",
    "here we are interested in the asymptotic behavior of the average height function for domino tilings of the aztec diamond .",
    "the arctangent formula tells us that these probabilities @xmath459 are slowly varying , so the average height function is locally approximated by functions of the form @xmath461 ( with @xmath106 , @xmath66 , and @xmath462 slowly varying ) .",
    "we call the pair @xmath463 the _ tilt _ of the plane @xmath464 .",
    "let us normalize our height functions by dividing through by @xmath0 , both in the domain and in the range .",
    "thus , in the limit we expect to see some sort of function @xmath465 on @xmath466 satisfying the piecewise - linear boundary condition @xmath467 for @xmath468 , as well as a lipschitz condition with constant 2 relative to the sup - norm distance . in addition",
    ", the formulation in the previous paragraph of how the average height changes when moving between vertices tells us that we should have @xmath469 and @xmath470 , where @xmath471 , @xmath472 , @xmath473 , and @xmath474 are the north - going , south - going , east - going , and west - going placement probabilities at @xmath13 , respectively .",
    "it can be shown ( although we do not prove this here ) that the domino shuffling algorithm of @xcite can be interpreted directly in terms of height functions , and that half of the values of the average height function for the diamond of order @xmath97 are equal to certain corresponding values of the average height function for the diamond of order @xmath0 .",
    "hence the average height functions for the aztec diamonds of orders @xmath0 and @xmath97 can not be too far apart . however , such considerations are not sufficient to yield a proof that the normalized average height functions converge to a continuum limit .",
    "the arctangent formula gives us the strength we need in order to conclude that a limit exists .",
    "recall that the average height function can be derived by taking cumulative sums and differences of local placement probabilities , with various coefficients . taking this assertion to the limit as @xmath412 , and using the fact that the placement probabilities approach a continuum limit",
    ", we see that the normalized average height function also approaches a limit .",
    "( it is true that the errors in the placement probabilities are going to add , and that there are more and more of them as @xmath0 gets large , but each individual error is going to be small , so that when we divide by @xmath0 the normalized error is small as well . )",
    "the limit must be some function @xmath475 ( defined for @xmath476 ) with the property that @xmath477 and @xmath478 for all @xmath13 in the interior of its domain .",
    "( here , we have expressed the placement probabilities near @xmath13 for all four domino orientations in terms of @xmath479 via rotational symmetry . )",
    "that is , the tilt of the tangent plane at a point ( associated with the average height function ) can be expressed in terms of the local placement probabilities for random domino tilings .",
    "this means that we ought to be able to reconstruct the function @xmath480 from theorem 1 via integration , making use of the known boundary conditions satisfied by @xmath481 .",
    "if we do this , it turns out that @xmath481 can be written in closed form , and indeed , a formula for @xmath481 can be written especially compactly if one makes use of the formula for @xmath35 itself .",
    "specifically , one can verify that the following formula for @xmath465 holds :    [ heightformula ] the normalized average height functions for large aztec diamonds converge uniformly to @xmath482    we simply check that this formula satisfies the differential equations and boundary conditions .    within the temperate zone ,",
    "the average height function is real analytic ; in each of the polar regions , it is an affine function of @xmath148 and @xmath188 . on the arctic circle itself , away from the points @xmath427 ,",
    "the function @xmath475 is differentiable but not twice - differentiable .",
    "it takes the value 2 at the points @xmath483 and the value 0 at the points @xmath484 , with piecewise - linear behavior on the boundary of the normalized diamond .",
    "the level set @xmath485 consists of the two line segments joining midpoints of opposite sides of the normalized diamond .",
    "one may ask , for diamonds of finite order @xmath0 , how closely the distribution on height functions is clustered around its mean value .",
    "we will see in the next subsection that the standard deviation of the height at any fixed location in the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 is at most @xmath486 .",
    "however , numerical evidence suggests that , at the center of the diamond , the standard deviation of the height is much smaller  more like @xmath487 , or perhaps even less than that .    our formulas for @xmath488 and @xmath489 , in combination with the arctangent formula , yield ( within the temperate zone ) the equation @xmath490 we can rewrite this equation in a slightly more illuminating way . for @xmath491 and @xmath492 ,",
    "define @xmath493 that is , we undo the scaling introduced in section  [ sec - introduction ] . then off the arctic circle",
    "we have @xmath494 where @xmath495 this function is a fundamental solution to the wave equation in two dimensions , with speed of propagation @xmath496 .",
    "that is , @xmath114 is a distribution satisfying @xmath497 @xmath498 and @xmath499 where @xmath183 is the ( two - dimensional ) dirac delta function .",
    "( for more details on fundamental solutions to the wave equation , see @xcite . )",
    "note that proposition  [ crest ] shows that , except for an oscillating factor , the creation rates also behave like @xmath500 .",
    "william jockusch has shown in personal communication how to use a generating function developed in @xcite to explain this behavior , by viewing the creation rates as numerical approximations to a solution of the wave equation .",
    "he has also pointed out that from his methods , one ought to be able to deduce a weak version of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "more specifically , one should be able to show that in any macroscopic subregion of a randomly tiled aztec diamond of order @xmath0 ( i.e. , any subregion of size comparable to that of the diamond ) , the expected density of north - going dominos is within @xmath19 of that predicted by integrating the arctangent formula ; in particular , this would suffice to prove proposition  [ heightformula ] .",
    "unfortunately , his methods would not rule out the possibility of small - scale fluctuations in the placement probabilities , such as one gets if one looks at placement probabilities for all horizontal domino spaces rather than just the north - going ones .",
    "the formula for the average height function that was derived in the preceding section from the arctangent formula applies not only to aztec diamonds , but also to all regions that approximate them in a suitable sense .",
    "( here , as hereafter , the term `` region , '' without qualifiers , should be understood to refer to finite regions in the plane that are unions of lattice squares and can be tiled with dominos . )",
    "it is not enough that the region being tiled should have a boundary that is roughly `` aztec '' in shape .",
    "for instance , figure  [ fig - fake1 ] shows a random domino tiling of a region obtained from the aztec diamond of order 32 by adding some squares along its boundary , while the region that is shown in figure  [ fig - fake2 ] , also studied in @xcite , was obtained by adding an extra row of length 64 in the middle of the diamond .",
    "( these random tilings were obtained via the method described in @xcite and are indeed truly random , to the extent that pseudo - random number generators can be trusted . ) in neither case do we get behavior consistent with the arctangent formula .",
    "on the other hand , figure  [ fig - real1 ] shows a random tiling of an aztec diamond to which _ two _ rows of length 64 have been added , and the resemblance to figure  [ fig - aztec ] is evident .",
    "the sense of mystery dissolves if one considers the behavior of the height function along the boundary in each of the three cases . in the first case ,",
    "the height function is nearly constant along the boundary ; in the second , the direction of change of the height function is the same along the southwest and northwest edges ( and also the same along the southeast and northeast edges ) ; and in the third , the direction of change of the height function switches as one rounds any of the four corners of the region . since it is the third situation that resembles the boundary behavior of height functions of aztec diamonds , it is not surprising that the third situation should also give behavior in the interior that is similar to what one sees for aztec diamonds .",
    "( in fact , if we view the third region as an aztec diamond of order 33 with two vertical dominos removed , then since almost all tilings of the aztec diamond contain those two dominos , the local statistics in the third region differ little from those in the aztec diamond of order @xmath501 . )",
    "note , incidentally , that if instead of adding a row of length 64 , as we did in figure  [ fig - fake2 ] , we removed a row of length 64 , then the resulting region is easily seen to have a unique tiling , consisting entirely of horizontal brickwork .",
    "although this situation may seem trivial , it can shed some light on what is happening in figure  [ fig - fake2 ] .",
    "the horizontal brickwork pattern seen almost everywhere in figure  [ fig - fake2 ] is the unique arrangement of dominos such that the height increases ( or decreases , depending on whether the dominos in the pattern are north - going or south - going ) as quickly as possible as one moves vertically . in an aztec diamond with a row of length 64 removed , the heights on the boundary are such that the only way to span the gap between the heights on the lower half of the boundary and those on the upper half is to change at this rate .",
    "thus , the only way to tile the region is with a brickwork pattern . in the case of figure  [ fig - fake2 ] , the occurrence of an extra row of length 64 gives the height function a tiny bit of slack , and we can see where this slack gets used by following the fault - line that runs from left to right .    of course , we could have predicted ahead of time that small modifications of the shape of the boundary can have a drastic impact on the tiling situation , since for instance adding a single square to a region ( or removing a single square ) can create a region with odd area , which can not be tiled at all .",
    "hence , we will want to assume that all the regions we discuss actually admit tilings by dominos , as stipulated in the first paragraph of this subsection .",
    "we will show in this subsection that regions similar to aztec diamonds , such as figure  [ fig - real1 ] , have approximately the same average height functions as the aztec diamonds they resemble .",
    "this will follow as a consequence of a more general result , asserting that the value of the average height function depends in a continuous manner on the values of the fixed heights along the boundary .",
    "that is , if one modifies the shape of the boundary in such a way that the height function along the new boundary , when plotted in three dimensions ( the two original dimensions plus a third dimension for height ) , is close to the graph of the old , the average heights of vertices in the interior will not change very much .    before we can do this ,",
    "we first prove a general monotonicity result about height functions .",
    "the idea for this approach was suggested by robin pemantle in personal communication .",

    "we have seen that for large @xmath0 , nearly all of this entropy is due to the variety exhibited inside , as opposed to outside , the arctic circle",
    ". it would be good to have more quantitative information on this . specifically , given a patch of an aztec diamond , one can define a random variable whose values are the near - tilings of the patch that result from restricting a uniform random tiling of the aztec diamond to just the patch ( such near - tilings are allowed to have untiled squares along the boundary of the patch ) , and one can consider the entropy of this new random variable . if the patch is very large ( while not long and skinny , for example like a @xmath652 rectangle ) , but the order of the aztec diamond is much larger still , then we believe that this entropy , when divided by the area of the patch , is close to a value which we would call the _ local entropy _ , and which would depend only on the normalized location of the patch .    in this subsection , we make a small start towards calculating local entropy by showing that it vanishes outside the arctic circle and that it is positive inside the arctic circle ( assuming it is well - defined there ) . assuming that local entropy is well - defined everywhere , this gives us another way of interpreting the arctic circle , namely as the boundary between the zero - entropy region and the positive - entropy region .",
    "the vanishing ( and perforce the well - definedness ) of local entropy outside the temperate zone is a simple consequence of the arctic circle theorem . to prove the other half of our claim ,",

    "in particular , we can look at the @xmath666 vertices that are at the centers of the @xmath666 non - overlapping @xmath664 blocks into which @xmath654 can be naturally decomposed .",
    "using linearity of expectation , we can see that the expected number of such @xmath655 blocks in a random tiling of the aztec diamond is at least @xmath667 .",

    ", the study of domino tilings is seen to be equivalent to the study of dimer - covers , which is one of the better - understood statistical mechanics models in two dimensions .",
    "studying domino tilings of special regions , such as aztec diamonds , is tantamount to studying the dimer model in the presence of special boundary conditions .",
    "the uniformity of the distribution corresponds to a degenerate situation in which all dimer configurations have the same energy .",
    "there has been surprisingly little work on the behavior of the dimer model in the presence of general boundary conditions ; researchers in statistical mechanics have tended to study either toroidal ( i.e. , periodic ) boundary conditions or boundary conditions that correspond to domino tilings of a rectangle .",

    "it was conjectured in @xcite that the analogue of the arctic circle theorem holds in the biased case .",
    "our methods prove that conjecture , as well as an arctangent formula that describes the behavior within the temperate zone .",

    "one can also prove biased versions of the robustness and variance results from subsections  [ ssec - robustness ]  and  [ ssec - variance ] .",
    "( in fact , the proofs are practically identical to the proofs given in those subsections . )",
    "using them in combination with the same methods used in subsection  [ ssec - act ] , we can prove a slightly strengthened version of the `` arctic ellipse conjecture '' from @xcite :    [ aec ] let @xmath40 , and @xmath3 .",
    "the probability that , in a random domino tiling with bias @xmath459 of an aztec diamond of order @xmath0 , the boundary of the polar regions is more than a distance @xmath4 in normalized coordinates from the ellipse @xmath689 is exponentially small in @xmath0 .",
    "in this article we have focused primarily on one particular family of finite regions , namely , aztec diamonds . here",
    "we will indicate what it might mean to have a theory that would apply to _ all _ simply - connected finite regions , and how aztec diamonds might play a role in the project of classifying the different possible local behaviors that random tilings of such regions can exhibit away from their boundaries .",
    "the results of subsections  [ ssec - robustness ]  and  [ ssec - variance ]  tell us that for any large simply - connected region @xmath253 that can be tiled by dominos , height functions associated with random tilings of @xmath253 will cluster around their average .",
    "we furthermore know that this average height function depends in a monotone way on the values of the height function on the boundary of @xmath253 , and is stable under certain kinds of slight perturbations of the boundary of @xmath253 .",
    "however , what these theorems do not tell us is whether this dependence is robust under scaling as well .",
    "proposition  [ heightformula ] tells us that such robustness does in fact hold for aztec diamonds : that is , when one normalizes two large aztec diamonds , one finds that the normalized average height functions are very close to one another . that this is true along the boundary is a triviality ; that it is true in the interior is a much subtler property , known to us only as a consequence of theorem  [ main ] .",
    "we conjecture that scaling - robustness of height functions is true in general .",
    "that is , suppose @xmath690 are finite , simply - connected , domino - tileable regions that grow without bound , such that suitably rescaled copies of the @xmath691 s converge to some compact subset @xmath692 of the plane .",
    "moreover , suppose that the height functions associated with the boundaries of the @xmath691 s , when rescaled by the same respective amounts , converge to some function on the boundary of @xmath692 .",
    "then we believe that the average height functions associated with the @xmath691 s , when rescaled , converge on the interior of @xmath692 as well as on the boundary to some function @xmath481 .",
    "if the boundary values behave reasonably ( perhaps piecewise smoothness suffices ) , then @xmath481 should be piecewise smooth ( with reasonably shaped pieces ) .    under this picture , we view @xmath481 as the solution to a somewhat strange sort of dirichlet problem .",
    "we will have more to say about this analogy shortly , but first we must leave the issues of large - scale structure ( embodied in the average height function ) and discuss the small - scale structure of random tilings .    consider simply - connected regions @xmath690 as above . in each region",
    "@xmath691 , choose a north - going domino space @xmath693 with normalized location @xmath694 in @xmath692 , so that @xmath695 as @xmath412 , and suppose that the asymptotic renormalized height function @xmath481 is differentiable at @xmath696 .",
    "assume that @xmath696 is in the interior of @xmath692 and that @xmath481 is `` non - extremal '' at @xmath696 , in the sense that its tilt @xmath697 satisfies @xmath698 .",
    "then we conjecture that the placement probabilities at the chosen north - going domino spaces @xmath693 converge .",
    "the arctangent formula tells us that the conjecture is in fact true for aztec diamonds .",
    "note that if we were to replace each @xmath693 by another north - going domino space @xmath699 obtained by shifting it by some fixed vector @xmath700 with @xmath701 even , we would get the same point @xmath696 in the normalized limit .",
    "hence , the preceding conjecture implies approximate local translation - invariance for the first - order statistics governing random tilings of large regions , provided one stays away from the boundary ( and the tilt is non - extremal ) .",
    "this corollary gives us a way to understand the importance of our hypothesis of non - extremality .",
    "for instance , consider the region shown in figure  [ fig - herringbone ] ; it has only one tiling , whose local statistics are in no sense governed by any of the statistics seen in aztec diamonds . taking a suitable limit of such regions one gets a height function whose tilt @xmath702 satisfies @xmath703 and hence violates non - extremality .",
    "indeed , the statistics do not even exhibit local translation - invariance .",
    "( note also that for the aztec diamond itself , @xmath480 is extremal at @xmath696 if and only if the asymptotic entropy at normalized location @xmath696 is zero , which is the case if and only if the asymptotic density of @xmath655 blocks at normalized location @xmath696 is zero . )    having made a conjecture about convergence of first - order statistics , we naturally wonder about higher - order statistics as well .",
    "we conjecture that in fact all finite - order statistics in the vicinity of the points @xmath694 stabilize as @xmath412 , yielding statistics that in some sense `` belong '' to the limit point @xmath696 ( as long as the tilt at @xmath696 is non - extremal ) .",
    "then , applying the translation - invariance remark made in the preceding paragraph , it follows that each @xmath696 determines a process whose values are domino tilings of the entire plane .",
    "for instance , taking the @xmath691 s to be aztec diamonds and the point @xmath696 to be the center of the normalized diamond , it is natural to conjecture that at the center of the aztec diamond of order @xmath0 , the local finite - order statistics converge to those of the maximal entropy process mentioned in the introduction .",
    "( this special case was conjectured in @xcite . ) letting @xmath696 vary inside the rescaled temperate zone , we would get a two - parameter family of tiling - valued processes ; they would all be distinct from one another because they would have distinct first - order statistics",
    ". the maximal entropy process would be unique among these processes not only in having the highest entropy but also in being invariant under the full group of lattice translations , rather than merely the color - preserving subgroup of index 2 .",
    "it can be shown rigorously that such processes , if they exist , have a combinatorial analogue of the `` gibbs property '' studied in equilibrium statistical mechanics ; that is , given a tiling of a cofinite subset of the plane whose finite complement is tileable , if one conditions the random process on that particular tiling , then the conditional distribution on tilings of the entire plane is uniform .    here",
    "we leave aside caution and put forward some conjectures about what sort of shape the ultimate theory we are striving towards will take .",
    "these surmises might be false , but we believe they are the natural avenues to pursue in further investigations of the theory .    in the first place , we conjecture that the tiling - valued processes associated with the points @xmath696 will turn out to be ergodic , or indecomposable , in the usual sense of the theory of dynamical systems .",
    "it is not hard to use the ergodic theorem for @xmath704-actions ( see @xcite ) to show that every ergodic , translation - invariant ( under color - preserving translations ) , tiling - valued random process determines placement probabilities @xmath471 , @xmath472 , @xmath474 , and @xmath473 and thence determines a tilt @xmath705 .",
    "we predict that in those cases where the tilt is non - extremal ( i.e. , @xmath706 is strictly less than 2 ) , there is in fact a unique ergodic gibbs measure with tilt @xmath702 .",
    "if this were true , it would have many nice consequences ; for instance , the four numbers @xmath707 would all be determined by the pair @xmath702 , and thus would exhibit only two degrees of freedom , despite the fact that the only obvious constraint governing them is @xmath708 .",
    "a further nice property is that the temperate zones of aztec diamonds would be universal in the sense that they would manifest , in the limit , all possible forms of non - extremal local behavior that random tilings of large simply - connected regions can manifest away from boundaries .",
    "this universality is not peculiar to aztec diamonds , but instead arises from the fact , proved in subsection  [ ssec - heterogeneity ] , that aztec diamonds exhibit all possible non - extremal tilts .",
    "an especially nice benefit of the preceding conjecture is that it would open the door to a variational approach to the problem of finding the average height function @xmath709 on @xmath692 given only its values on the boundary of @xmath692 . given any candidate for @xmath709 , define @xmath710 as the number of domino tilings of @xmath691 whose normalized height functions stay close to @xmath709 .",
    "it does not seem too far - fetched to hope that the logarithm of @xmath710 , when divided by the area of @xmath691 , converges to an integral over @xmath692 , in which the integrand is the entropy associated with the unique ergodic gibbs process with tilt @xmath711 .",
    "since finding the average height function on @xmath691 corresponds in some sense to maximizing @xmath710 , we would hope that finding the asymptotic normalized height function on @xmath692 corresponds to maximizing this integral .",
    "it might not always be possible to solve the associated calculus of variations problem explicitly , but such a theorem would be a major advance towards a complete understanding of how the presence of boundary conditions can affect the behavior of a domino tiling in the interior of a region .",
    "the preceding idea has in fact been used by physicists , in the context of crystals ; see for example @xcite . there",
    ", it is claimed that the shape of a crystal surface is determined by minimizing the total surface free energy , which is obtained by integrating a local contribution ( the surface free energy density ) depending only on the gradient of the surface .",
    "this is believable physically , but in any particular lattice model it seems difficult to establish rigorously ; it is not even clear on purely mathematical grounds why there should exist a surface free energy density depending only on the gradient .",
    "the analogous statement in random tiling theory is the existence of a local entropy depending only on the tilt of the height function , but it is conceivable ( although we consider it unlikely ) that the local entropy might not be determined by the local asymptotic behavior of the normalized height function .",
    "the only approach that we know of that might lead to a rigorous proof ( or even a heuristic argument ) is to prove the conjectures above about local statistics and gibbs measures .",
    "we thank robin pemantle for suggesting the idea behind lemma  [ monotone ] .",
    "thanks also to david feldman for providing helpful comments on the manuscript , to sameera iyengar for writing the program that produced the random tiling shown in figure  [ fig - aztec ] , to m.  josie ammer and dan ionescu for writing the first programs to compute placement probabilities for aztec diamonds , to pramod achar , federico ardila , dan ionescu , and ben raphael for helping to write the programs that produced the random tilings shown in figures  [ fig - fake1 ] , [ fig - fake2 ] , and [ fig - real1 ] , and to david wilson for helping to create the figures ."

    "<S> we prove an asymptotic formula for the probability that , if one chooses a domino tiling of a large aztec diamond at random according to the uniform distribution on such tilings , the tiling will contain a domino covering a given pair of adjacent lattice squares . </S>",
    "<S> this formula quantifies the effect of the diamond s boundary conditions on the behavior of typical tilings ; in addition , it yields a new proof of the arctic circle theorem of jockusch , propp , and shor . </S>",
    "<S> our approach is to use the saddle point method to estimate certain weighted sums of squares of krawtchouk polynomials ( whose relevance to domino tilings is demonstrated elsewhere ) , and to combine these estimates with some exponential sum bounds to deduce our final result . </S>",
    "<S> this approach generalizes straightforwardly to the case in which the probability distribution on the set of tilings incorporates bias favoring horizontal over vertical tiles or vice versa . </S>",
    "<S> we also prove a fairly general large deviation estimate for domino tilings of simply - connected planar regions that implies that some of our results on aztec diamonds apply to many other similar regions as well . </S>"
