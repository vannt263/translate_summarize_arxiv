    "we examine the probability density functions ( pdfs ) of decaying passive scalars without mean gradients under the action of smooth , incompressible and time aperiodic flows in bounded periodic domains . in this situation",
    "the evolution of a passive scalar , @xmath1 , is governed by the advection - diffusion ( ad ) equation .",
    "@xmath2    here @xmath3 represents the molecular diffusivity of the passive scalar and @xmath4 is the advecting velocity field . the domain ( d ) under consideration is periodic , specifically we take d to be @xmath5 \\times [ 0,2\\pi]$ ] with opposite sides identified ( i.e. a 2-torus ) .",
    "+ in this work , we consider time aperiodic velocity fields whose spatial scale of variation is comparable to the scale of the domain . essentially , the flows are of the type encountered in chaotic advection @xcite and the parameters correspond to relatively large peclet numbers .",
    "we focus on the case when the normalized scalar pdf s attain a self - similar profile .",
    "this self - similar regime was first described by pierrehumbert @xcite,@xcite ( who named it a strange or statistical eigenmode ) and has recently been examined in detail by fereday and haynes @xcite ( hereafter fh ) and also by sukhatme and pierrehumbert @xcite ( hereafter sp ) .",
    "the self - similarity of the normalized pdf is indicative of a non - equilibrium steady state .",
    "physically , as was explained in sp and fh , the ingredients in the balance responsible for this state are : ( i ) a limit on how thin filaments can get ( as @xmath6 ) and ( ii ) the `` folding and filling '' of filaments induced by the finite domain . + to place the things in a proper perspective , we introduce the following scales : l - the scale of the domain , @xmath7 - the scale of variation of the velocity field and @xmath8 - the maximum scale of variation of the scalar field . in terms of these scales the self - similar strange eigenmode is characterized by @xmath9 . due to this similarity of scales",
    "the problem possesses a global nature ( see fh and sp ) .",
    "hence , approximations based on scale separation ( such as shifting to a comoving reference frame ) , which have yielded excellent results in other smooth advection diffusion regimes - sometimes referred to as the batchelor regime - can not be fruitfully utilized ( see @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "also , when @xmath10 ( i.e. , the batchelor regime ) , it has been demonstrated that the pdf s are non - universal , i.e. their shape evolves in time @xcite .",
    "obviously , in such a situation there is no limiting scalar pdf and the theory of sinai and yakhot @xcite , which apriori assumes the existence of such a limit , fails .",
    "+ indeed , it is the attainment of a self - similar , i.e. limiting , pdf profile in finite time that makes the strange eigenmode regime a suitable candidate for applying the sinai - yakhot formalism . +",
    "consider the dimensionless normalized variable @xmath11 , by assuming the stationarity in time of @xmath12 for all @xmath13 , sinai and yakhot @xcite showed ,    @xmath14    where @xmath15 .",

    "as it turns out , later work @xcite,@xcite , @xcite , @xcite ( see @xcite for an overview ) clarified that the pdf of any statistically homogenous twice differentiable random field , say @xmath20 , is given by @xcite , @xcite ,    @xmath21 \\label{1e}\\ ] ]    @xmath22 and @xmath23 , @xmath24 represent the conditional diffusion and conditional dissipation respectively .",

    "more importantly , @xmath29 , this linearity implies the stationarity of the moments of the normalized scalar field . , but in this case @xmath30 is a nonlinear function of the moment order @xmath13 , i.e. the moments are not stationary @xcite .",
    "+ ] ofcourse , given the stationarity , we are justified in using eq .",

    "( [ 1f ] ) from eq .",
    "( [ 1 g ] ) we get ,    @xmath32    regarding the conditional dissipation , if @xmath16 and @xmath33 are independent , then @xmath34 . this coupled with the fact that @xmath35 is even led sinai and yakhot to propose the expansion ( in the vicinity of @xmath36)@xcite ,    @xmath37    substituting from eq .",

    "( [ 1j ] ) ,    @xmath42    recent numerical work ( see fh ) suggests that , @xmath43 tends to a non - zero limit as @xmath44 , hence eq .",
    "( [ 1ll ] ) gives @xmath45 assuming that @xmath46 does not overwhelm the limit .",
    "in other words , keeping the assumption regarding @xmath46 in mind , @xmath16 and @xmath33 tend to become independent as @xmath44 and we expect the core of the pdf to tend to a universal gaussian profile . + further substituting eq .",

    "as is seen , the normalized moments attain constant values after a transient period of about 70 iterations . during",
    "this transient period @xmath49 evolves ( a remnant of the initial double delta pdf can be seen at iteration 10 ) .",

    "+    * varying the diffusivity : keeping @xmath66 fixed and utilizing the same checkerboard initial condition , we vary @xmath3 . in each case",
    "the evolution of the pdf is similar to that shown in fig .",

    "[ fig : fig2 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : fig0 ] is evident ( essentially , the dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath3 is fairly weak , when @xmath3 changes by an order of magnitude , as in the above simulation , @xmath43 changes by a much smaller amount ) .",
    "the corresponding plots of the normalized conditional dissipation are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] . note that for small @xmath3 , we have @xmath73 .",
    "also , from fig .",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] we see that for small @xmath3 the range of @xmath16 is quite small , hence in this situation the gaussian form describes a fairly large part of the complete pdf .",
    "next , in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] we show the pdf s for a number of small diffusivities .",
    "clearly , the core of @xmath49 tends to a universal gaussian form . *",
    "varying the strength of the flow : fixing @xmath74 we vary @xmath66 .",
    "the decay of the scalar variance for different flow strengths can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig5 ] . evidently , @xmath75 flow strength , therefore for a fixed @xmath3 , @xmath76 1/(flow strength ) .",
    "the implication being that the core of @xmath49 should tend to a gaussian function for stronger flows .",
    "[ fig : fig6 ] shows the pdf s ( in the self - similar stage ) for two different flow strengths - note the similarity to fig . [",
    "fig : fig2 ] . furthermore , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig7 ] shows the pdf s for a number of simulations with stronger flows .",
    "once again , the emergence of a universal gaussian core is evident .",
    "also , note the similarity to fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "by applying the formalism introduced by sinai and yakhot @xcite to a decaying passive scalar obeying the ad equation in a periodic domain , we obtained an expression for the pdf of the normalized scalar field .",
    "broadly categorized as a power - law , the core of the pdf was shown to be dependent on the physical parameters in the ad problem .",
    "moreover , we saw the emergence of a universal gaussian core for the pdf in : ( a ) the limit of small diffusivity for a fixed flow strength and ( b ) the limit of strong flows for fixed @xmath3 . combining these observations we infer the emergence of a universal gaussian core in the limit of large peclet numbers .",
    "note that , the detailed dependence on peclet number is not straight forward as @xmath49 is a function of both @xmath43 and @xmath3 ( eq . ( [ 1l ] ) ) - in turn @xmath43 depends on both on @xmath3 and flow strength .",
    "interestingly , for smaller peclet numbers ( i.e. larger @xmath50 ) the power - law pdf profile resembles a pure or stretched exponential function .",
    "we believe that this is the reason for the mis - identification of pdf profiles in earlier work @xcite ( and also sp ) .",
    "+ an intriguing , though poorly understood , feature of the strange eigenmode regime is the actual decay rate of the scalar variance - i.e. @xmath43 . note that , in contrast to the present statistical or strange eigenmode , when the velocity fields are _ time periodic _ , and @xmath77 , the scalar field represents a periodic eigenfunction of the ad operator .",
    "hence , the structure as well as decay rate of the scalar field are better understood . regarding these periodic eigenfunctions , or spatially repeating patterns ,",
    "see @xcite for experimental results , sp for a physical interpretation , @xcite for more recent work , @xcite for a mathematically rigorous presentation and @xcite for an interpretation in terms of the perron - frobenius operator induced by the underlying trajectory problem . also , see @xcite , @xcite for similar ideas in the case of _ steady _ 3d and 2d flows respectively .",
    "+ before concluding we would like to put forth a plausible connection between the eigenmode regime and homogenization theory , with the hope of shedding some light on @xmath43 .",
    "broadly , in the realm of homogenization theory it has been possible to show the convergence , in a coarse grained sense , of the ad equation to a pure diffusion equation for a variety of advecting velocity fields ( see section 2 of @xcite or @xcite for recent reviews ) . the most common situation is when @xmath78 , i.e. velocity fields changing rapidly in space but combined with either steadiness or periodicity in time @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the opposite limit , along the lines of the work by kubo @xcite , is where the velocity fields have longe range spatial correlations but change rapidly in time ( see section 2.4.1 of @xcite or @xcite ) .",
    "+ indeed , it is this second limit where the effective diffusivity of the scalar field is given by the taylor - kubo formula @xcite .",
    "recent work has shown that such a diffusive limit exists for a broader class of velocity fields , though the formula for the effective diffusivity may not be analytically tractable @xcite,@xcite . noting the long range spatial ( @xmath79 ) and short time ( randomness at each iteration ) correlations of the velocity field required for the emergence of the self - similar eigenmode , we conjecture that the strange eigenmode may be understood as a homogenization phenomenon .",
    "hence , averages such as @xmath80 obey the diffusion equation , in particular @xmath43 can be interpreted as an effective diffusivity akin to the taylor - kubo formula . not only does this interpretation lend qualitative support to the observed dependence of @xmath43 on @xmath3 as well as the velocity field , it also implies the linearity of @xmath30 with @xmath13 .",
