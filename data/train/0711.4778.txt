    "the unitary extension of chiral perturbation theory , u@xmath0pt , has been successfully applied to study many meson - baryon and meson - meson interactions .",
    "more recently , it has been used to study the lowest axial vector mesons @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath1 and @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "both works generate most of the low - lying axial vector mesons dynamically .",
    "however , there is a surprising discovery in ref .",
    "@xcite , i.e. , two poles are found in the second riemann sheet in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 channel and both are attributed to the @xmath1 .",
    "although the @xmath1 has been observed in various reactions , the most conclusive and high - statistics data of the @xmath1 come from the wa3 experiment at cern that accumulated data on the reaction @xmath11 at 63 gev .",
    "these data were analyzed by the accmor collaboration  @xcite . as will be shown in this paper , the two - peak structure , with a peak at lower energy depending drastically on the reaction channel investigated ,",
    "can be easily explained in our model with two poles for the @xmath1 plus the @xmath8 . with only one pole , as has been noted long time ago  @xcite , there is always a discrepancy for the peak positions observed in the @xmath12 and @xmath13 invariant mass distributions .",
    "in the following , we briefly describe the chiral unitary approach , while detailed formalism can be found in refs .  @xcite . in the bethe - salpeter formulation of the unitary chiral perturbation theory  @xcite",

    "the loop function @xmath17 can be regularized either by a cutoff or by dimensional regularization . in the former case , one has cutoff values , whereas in the latter , one has subtraction constants as free parameters , which have to be fitted to the data .     and @xmath21 channel.,title=\"fig : \" ] and @xmath21 channel.,title=\"fig : \" ]",

    "the pole positions and corresponding widths obtained with this set of parameters are shown in table [ tab : poles2 ] . from fig .",
    "[ fig : gtvpvp ] , the two poles are clearly seen : the higher pole manifests itself as one relatively narrower resonance around 1.28 gev and the lower pole as a broader resonance at @xmath35 gev .",
    "the effective couplings for the coupled channels @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath13 , @xmath38 and @xmath12 , calculated from the residues of the amplitudes at the complex pole positions , are tabulated in table  [ tab : coup ] for both the lower pole and the higher pole , respectively .",

    "if different reaction mechanisms favor one or the other channel , they will see different shapes for the resonance .",
    "more importantly , it is to be noted that not only the two poles couple to different channels with different strengths , but also they manifest themselves in different final states . in other words , in the @xmath13 final states , one favors a narrower resonance around 1.28 gev , while in the @xmath12 final states , one would favor a broader resonance at a smaller invariant mass .",
    "the reaction @xmath39 can be analyzed by the isobar model as @xmath40 .",
    "therefore , one can construct the following amplitudes to simulate this process . assuming @xmath21 dominance for @xmath41 and @xmath42 as suggested by the experiment one has @xmath43 where @xmath44 are the coupled channel amplitudes obtained in section 2 and the clebsch - gordan coefficient @xmath45(@xmath46 ) accounts for projecting the @xmath21 @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) state into @xmath41(@xmath42 ) .",
    "the coefficients @xmath47 and @xmath48 are complex couplings .    to contrast our model with data",

    "[ fig : s1 ] in comparison with the wa3 data  @xcite .    from fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] , it is clearly seen that our model can fit the data around the peaks very well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] , the dashed and dotted lines are the separate contributions of the @xmath1 and the @xmath8 .",
    "one can easily see that the @xmath8 decays dominantly to @xmath12 , which is consistent with our present understanding of this resonance .",
    "it should be mentioned that in our model the lower peak observed in the invariant mass distribution of the @xmath12 channel is due to the contribution of the two poles of the @xmath1 .",
    "this is very different from the traditional interpretation .",
    "for example , the lower peak observed in the @xmath12 invariant mass distributions of @xmath75 at 13 gev was interpreted as a pure gaussian background by carnegie et al .",
    "@xcite , which has a shape similar to the contribution of the @xmath1 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] . on the other hand ,",
    "the k - matrix approach was adopted to analyze the wa3 data  @xcite and the slac data  @xcite . in this latter approach ,",
    "the lower peak mostly comes from the so - called deck background , which after unitarization , also has a shape of resonance .",
    "as we mentioned in the introduction , even in the original wa3 paper  @xcite , it was noted that their model failed to describe the @xmath76(@xmath12 ) data , in the notation @xmath77 with @xmath78 the naturality of the exchange  @xcite .",
    "the predicted peak is 20 mev higher than the data .",
    "if the fit were done only to the @xmath12 data , the agreement was much better but then the predicted @xmath1 would be lower by 35 mev than that obtained when other channels were also considered in the fit .",
    "it is worth stressing that the @xmath1 peak seen in the upper - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : s1 ] is significantly broader than that in the upper - right panel .",
    "furthermore the peak positions are also different in the two cases ( 1240 mev and 1280 mev respectively ) .",
    "both features have a straightforward interpretation in our theoretical description since the first one is dominated by the low - energy ( broader ) @xmath1 state , while the second one is dominated by the higher - energy ( narrower ) @xmath1 state .",
    "studies based on unitary chiral perturbation theory obtain two poles in the @xmath10 , @xmath9 , vector - pseudoscalar scattering amplitudes which can be assigned to two @xmath1 resonances .",
    "one pole is at @xmath79 mev with a width of @xmath80 mev and the other is at @xmath81 mev with a width of @xmath82 mev .",
    "the lower pole couples more to the @xmath12 channel whereas the higher pole couples dominantly to the @xmath13 channel .",
    "different reaction mechanisms may prefer different channels and thus this explains the different invariant mass distributions seen in various experiments .",
    "we have analyzed the wa3 data on the @xmath83 reaction since it is the most conclusive and high - statistics experiment quoted in the pdg on the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "our model obtains a good description of the wa3 data both for the @xmath12 and @xmath13 final state channels . in our model ,",
    "the peak in the @xmath70 mass distribution around the @xmath84 mev region is a superposition of the two poles , but in the @xmath12 channel the lower pole dominates and in the @xmath13 channel the higher pole gives the biggest contribution .",
