    "in recent years problems of quantum computing  ( qc ) and information processing have received increasing attention . to solve certain classes of problems in a potentially very powerful way ,",
    "one tries to utilize in  qc the quantum - mechanical superposition principle and the ( non - classical ) entanglement @xcite , an undertaking which , at the same time , should contribute to our basic understanding of quantum mechanics itself ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "however , building a large - scale quantum computer remains an extremely difficult task .",
    "the major obstacle is the coupling of the quantum computer to the environment , which tends to destroy quantum - mechanical superpositions very rapidly .",
    "this effect is usually referred to as decoherence .",
    "present - day technology does not yet support the realization of a practical quantum computer . on the other hand",
    ", there might be interesting small - scale physics in a pure quantum regime based on a few pseudo - spins ( qubits ) , which are realizable right now .",
    "chaotic behaviour as an exponential sensitivity to initial conditions has been well established in classical non - linear systems .",
    "the deterministic chaos , which occurs in non - dissipative systems , can typically be found starting from regular states as a function of some external control parameter .",
    "however , there seems to be no direct analogue to chaos in the quantum world : if two quantum states are initially almost identical ( that is , theirscalar product is very close to @xmath1 ) , they will remain so forever , since the hamiltonian evolution is a unitary mapping which preserves scalar products . according to this negative result , the semiclassical ` quantum chaology '",
    "@xcite has been constrained to studying some quantum - mechanical ` fingerprints of chaos ' ( like spectral properties ) , and non - trivial transitions from the quantum - to the classical domain and vice versa , following bohr s correspondence principle ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , experimental progress in mesoscopic physics , e.g. the transport of electrons through so - called ` chaotic quantum dots ' @xcite , has attracted a great deal of interest , the results of which give numerical evidence for weak chaos ( indicated by level repulsion ) @xcite .    while most models of qc have been concerned with networks of quantum gates , which are reminiscent of classical integrated circuits , models based on quantum turing machines  ( qtm ) @xcite have been described along different lines but have not given rise to much potential for future applications up to now . in both cases the complexity of the computation is characterized by sequences of unitary transformations ( or the corresponding hamiltonians  @xmath2 acting during finite time interval steps ) .",
    "the study of quantum chaos based on quantum gate networks has so far been proposed e.g. by implementing quantum baker s map on a 3-qubit nmr quantum computer @xcite , by realizing a quantum - mechanical delta - kicked harmonic oscillator or a harmonically driven oscillator in an ion trap @xcite , and by showing quantum - mechanical localization of an ion in a trap @xcite . in all these cases",
    "some sort of sensitivity has been predicted with respect to parameters specifying the dynamics ( e.g. the respective hamiltonian ) .",
    "here we explicitly describe an iterative map with a few qubits which , though based on standard gates , can be thought to be realized as a qtm architecture : local transformations of the turing head controlled by a fibonacci - like sequence of rotation angles alternate with a quantum - controlled not - operation with a second spin on the turing tape . this chaotic control can generate a chaotic quantum propagation in the ` classical ' regime @xcite , defined here as one with the turing head being restricted to an entanglement - free state sequence ( ` primitive ' )  @xcite .",
    "it will then be shown that chaos on the turing head can be found also for the quantum - mechanical superposition of those primitives , implying entanglement between head and tape as a genuine quantum feature ( ` non - classical regime ' ) .",
    "finally , due to this quantum correlation , we find a chaotic propagation even in the reduced subspace of the turing tape ( ` chaos swapping ' ) , and as a result also in the total network state @xmath3 .",
    "this behaviour should be contrasted with that of a regular qtm with its long - time revivals , which are absent in the ` chaotic ' qtm .",
    "the quantum network @xcite to be considered is composed of @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) pseudo - spins @xmath6 ( turing - head @xmath7 , turing - tape spins @xmath8 ) so that its network state @xmath9 lives in the @xmath10-dimensional hilbert space spanned by the product wave - functions @xmath11 . correspondingly , any ( unitary ) network operator can be expanded as a sum of product operators .",
    "the latter may be based on the following @xmath12-generators @xmath13 where @xmath14 is a ( local ) transition operator . for simplicity",
    "we restrict ourselves here to @xmath15 .",
    "the initial state @xmath16 will be taken to be a product of the turing - head and tape wave - functions .",
    "for the discretized dynamical description of the qtm we identify the unitary operators @xmath17 ( step number ) with the local unitary transformation on the turing - head @xmath7 , @xmath18 , and the quantum - controlled - not ( qcnot ) on ( @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 , respectively , as follows : @xmath21 where the turing head is externally driven by the fibonacci - like sequence @xmath22 ( mod @xmath23 ) , @xmath24 .",
    "the @xmath25th fibonacci number @xmath26 is then controlled by @xmath27 via @xmath28 where @xmath29 .",
    "the sequence @xmath0 ( mod @xmath30 ) acts as a chaotic input ( lyapunov exponent : @xmath31 ) .",
    "it is useful for later calculations to note that @xmath32 where @xmath33 , the @xmath25th fibonacci number with @xmath34 .",
    "the chaotic sequence of fibonacci - type can be interpreted as a temporal random ( chaotic ) analogue to @xmath1-dimensional chaotic potentials in real space @xcite .",
    "first , we restrict ourselves to the reduced state - space dynamics of the head  @xmath7 and tape - spin  @xmath1 , respectively , @xmath35 @xmath3 is the total network state at step @xmath36 , @xmath37 are the respective bloch - vectors .",
    "we intend to show that these local propagations are chaotic , too . due to the entanglement between the head and tape , both",
    "will , in general , appear to be in a ` mixed - state ' , which means that the length of the bloch - vectors in ( [ bloch ] ) is less than @xmath1 .",
    "however , for specific initial states @xmath38 the state of head and tape will remain pure : as @xmath39 with latexmath:[$\\hat{\\lambda}_{1}^{(1 ) }     @xmath20 of equation  ( [ ub ] ) can not create any entanglement , irrespective of the head state @xmath41 , i.e. latexmath:[\\[\\begin{aligned } \\label{entangle } \\hat{u}^{(s,1)}\\,|\\varphi\\rangle\\!^{(s ) } \\otimes\\,|+\\rangle\\!^{(1)}\\,&=&\\ ,    \\hat{u}^{(s,1)}\\,|\\varphi\\rangle\\!^{(s ) } \\otimes\\,|-\\rangle\\!^{(1)}\\,&=&\\ , \\hat{\\lambda}_{3}^{(s ) }     a consequence , the state  @xmath3 remains a product state at any step  @xmath36 for the initial product states @xmath43 and the turing head then performs a pure - state trajectory ( ` primitive ' ) on the bloch - circle @xmath44 @xmath45    here @xmath46 denotes the bloch - vector of the turing head @xmath7 conditioned by the initial state @xmath47 . from the fibonacci relation and the property ( [ entangle ] ) it is found for @xmath48 , and @xmath49 that @xmath50 where @xmath51 , and @xmath52 . in order to derive the corresponding expression of @xmath53 for @xmath54 , we utilize the following recursion relations for the cumulative rotation angle @xmath55 up to step @xmath36 @xmath56 then @xmath57 , respectively , satisfy the following expressions : @xmath58 yielding @xmath59 @xmath60 $ ] .",
    "the fibonacci property implies that both primitives , @xmath61 and @xmath54 , are chaotically driven .    from any initial state ,",
    "@xmath62 , @xmath63 this trajectory of the turing - head  @xmath7 represents a non - orthogonal pure - state decomposition . by using ( [ plus_fibo ] ) , ( [ cumulative ] ) , ( [ super ] ) @xmath64 we finally have for @xmath65 @xmath66 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 .",
    "the expression  ( [ chaotic_driving ] ) indicates that also in the ` non - classical ' regime the local dynamics of the turing head is controlled by a ` chaotic ' driving force , since the sequences @xmath69 and @xmath70 , namely @xmath71 ( mod @xmath30 ) or @xmath72 ( mod @xmath30 ) , respectively , are in fact both chaotic , as @xmath73 ( mod @xmath30 ) is .",
    "the bloch - vector @xmath74 can alternatively be calculated directly from the initial state latexmath:[$\\left ( \\mbox{here:}\\ ,     and for any control angle @xmath27 by using equation  ( [ cumul ] ) and the relations @xmath76 demonstrating a striking computational reducibility in that one needs for calculating @xmath74 neither the total network state @xmath3 nor to follow up each individual step @xmath36 .",
    "now we verify that the periodic orbits on the plane @xmath77 are unstable , which proves that the dynamics of the turing head ( ` output ' ) is indeed chaotic ( figure  [ qtm_chaos ] ) .",
    "because of the alternating character of the dynamics , equations  ( [ us ] ) , ( [ ub ] ) , it suffices to check the periodicity only for step @xmath78 : the periodic orbits for @xmath79 must obey two constraints , @xmath80 and @xmath81 ( mod @xmath30 ) for @xmath82 ( one concludes that @xmath27 must be a rational multiple of @xmath83 ) . by using the fibonacci numbers ( [ fibonacci ] )",
    ", one finds @xmath84 in ( [ plus_fibo ] ) and @xmath85 in ( [ cumulative ] ) , respectively , for period @xmath86 as @xmath87 then let us consider a small perturbation @xmath88 of the initial phase angle @xmath24 , implying @xmath89 and a perturbed fibonacci - like sequence @xmath90 ( mod @xmath30 ) : @xmath91 similarly to ( [ plus_po ] ) , we obtain for this case @xmath92 , where the deviation terms from the periodic orbits read , respectively , @xmath93 by using ( [ pm_per ] ) , we are able to represent the evolution of the perturbation , @xmath94 , at the @xmath78-th step for the turing - head dynamics as @xmath95 where @xmath96 @xmath97@xmath98 @xmath99@xmath100 , respectively .",
    "one easily shows @xmath101 $ ] that @xmath102 which means that @xmath103 grows exponentially ( note that @xmath104 ) , and the periodic orbit on the turing head is thus unstable to any small perturbation @xmath88 in the external control .    as an explicit example consider the case of @xmath105 with @xmath106 : by using equation  ( [ rel_beta ] ) in equation  ( [ plus_po ] ) for @xmath107 the periodic orbits with period @xmath108 have to obey @xmath109 ( mod 5 ) .",
    "together with the second condition , @xmath110 ( mod 5 ) for @xmath82 , we obtain @xmath111 , @xmath112 ( mod 5 ) .",
    "for @xmath113 it follows likewise that @xmath111 ( mod 5 ) for @xmath114 even , @xmath115 ( mod 5 ) for @xmath114 odd . considering the common condition for both cases , @xmath111 and @xmath112 ( mod 5 )",
    ", we find the smallest @xmath25 satisfying both conditions , namely @xmath116 , i.e. @xmath117 . @xmath118 $ ] .",
    "remarkably enough , the local dynamics of the turing tape also contains some exponential sensitivity to initial conditions @xmath119 + 1}\\ , -\\ , \\alpha_1\\ , + \\ ,   \\delta_{\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]}^{\\mbox{fib}}\\right)&\\;\\;\\;\\;n=0,1\\ ; ( \\mbox{mod}\\ ; 4)\\\\ & \\\\ \\cos\\left(\\alpha_{\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]+1}\\ , + \\ ,   \\delta_{\\left[\\frac{n}{2}\\right]}^{\\mbox{fib}}\\right)&\\;\\;\\;\\;n=2,3\\ ; ( \\mbox{mod}\\ ; 4)\\ , , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] where @xmath120 : = n,\\,a = n + r,\\,n \\in { \\mathbf{z}},\\ , 0 \\leq r < 1 $ ] .",
    "one easily confirms that there is no periodic orbit with period @xmath121 ( mod@xmath122 ) .",
    "the following expression for the deviation from the periodic orbits with period @xmath123 ( mod @xmath122 ) at step @xmath124 holds : @xmath125 with @xmath126 ; the perturbation @xmath88 in ( [ pertur ] ) does not enter into the turing - tape dynamics until @xmath127 !",
    "equation  ( [ chaos_swapping ] ) shows the exponential instability of the periodic orbit .",
    "indeed , the turing tape exhibits chaos only by means of the entanglement with the head ( ` chaos swapping ' ) , not as a result of a direct chaotic driving force .",
    "the distance between density operators , @xmath128 and @xmath129 , defined by the so - called bures metric @xcite @xmath130 lies , independent of the dimension of the liouville space , between 0 and 2 [ the maximum ( squared ) distance of 2 applies to pure orthogonal states , @xmath131 .",
    "this metric can be applied to the total - network - state space or any subspace . in any case",
    "it is a convenient additional means to characterize various qtms : for @xmath132 ( lyapunov exponent @xmath133 ) @xcite and any @xmath88 the distance remains almost constant ( see figure  [ 2figs]@xmath134 ) ; for the fibonacci - like driving force , on the other hand , @xmath135 we obtain an initial exponential sensitivity , which is eventually constrained , though , by @xmath136 ( see figure  [ 2figs]@xmath137 - @xmath138 ) .",
    "it is instructive to consider another regular qtm controlled by the rule @xmath139 ( lyapunov exponent @xmath133 ) : @xmath140 .",
    "here we observe a revival in the evolution of @xmath141 , which confirms that periodic orbits are stable ( figure [ 2figs]@xmath134 ) , whereas there is no revival for the above chaotic system .",
    "finally we display the evolution of @xmath141 for the total network state @xmath3 , which also shows exponential sensitivity .",
    "the respective distances for tape - spin @xmath1 are similar to those shown .",
    "the ultimate source of the present chaotic behaviour is that any small perturbation @xmath88 to the initial state , @xmath142 , is connected with a perturbed unitary evolution , @xmath143 , which implies that the scalar product between different initial states ( as a measure of distance ) is no longer conserved under these evolutions : @xmath144 thus the initial state is directly correlated to its unitary evolution , which can lead to the exponential sensitivity to initial condition , whereas there is no chaos in a generic quantum system evolving by a fixed @xmath145 even if characterized by chaotic input parameters .",
    "this @xmath146 reminds us immediately of the test function @xmath147 in the control ( _ cf . _ the comment by r.  schack @xcite ) .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the quantum dynamics of a small chaotically driven qtm based on a decoherence - free hamiltonian .",
    "quantum chaos has been shown to occur as an exponential parameter - sensitivity and a cumulative loss of control in a pure quantum regime .",
    "this might be contrasted with the usual quantum chaology , which is concerned essentially with semiclassical spectrum analysis of classically chaotic systems ( e.g. level spacing , spectral rigidity ) . as quantum features we utilized the superposition principle and the physics of entanglement .",
    "our dynamical chaos manifests itself in the superposition and entanglement of a pair of ` classical ' ( i.e. unentangled ) chaotic state - sequences . due to the entanglement",
    ", we can see the chaos in any local bloch - plane .",
    "this indicates that patterns in reduced bloch - spheres ( a quantum version of a poincar - cut , figure  [ stability ] ) should be useful to characterize quantum chaos in a broad class of quantum networks : here , a periodic orbit would be represented by finite set of fixed points on the plane @xmath148 .",
    "it is noteworthy that this kind of control loss is completely different from the typical control limit of a quantum network resulting from the exponential blow - up of hilbert - space dimension in which the state evolves @xcite .",
    "it is expected that a qtm architecture with a larger number of pseudo - spins on the turing tape would also exhibit chaos under the same type of driving .",
    "however , it is just the chaos in small networks which might be interesting for experimental studies , especially in the form of ensembles thereof . the fibonacci - like sequence should , however , be considered but a special example for chaotic input .",
    "such inputs would , of course , have to be avoided in quantum computation ; otherwise the resulting quantum dynamics would easily become chaotic in its entirety !",
