    "in the monte carlo programs for @xmath13 colliders , one has to model initial state radiation ( isr ) as precisely as possible . for some processes where the precision requirements are moderate , such as the single-@xmath14 production process at lep , where the combined lep2 precision is estimated at @xmath15 , see ref .",
    "@xcite , it is sufficient to implement isr in the leading - logarithmic ( ll ) approximation .",
    "this can be done by modelling isr in the collinear , @xmath16 , approximation ( see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) , by `` unfolding '' the strictly collinear structure functions @xcite or using the so - called `` parton shower '' technique as in ref .  @xcite ( recently employed also in @xcite ) , or the yennie  frautschi",
    " suura ( yfs ) exclusive exponentiation employed in ref .",
    "@xcite ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for a more complete list of references . in all of the above mc programs the final state radiation ( fsr ) from charged final particles is either not modelled at all or simulated completely independently of the isr , which is the general spirit of the ll approximation",
    ". this may be problematic if one of the final state charged particles gets close to the beam particle with the same electric charge .",
    "in such a case isr photon emission is damped , because of the well - known _ electric charge screening _",
    "effect ( ecs ) , and the total energy distribution of the isr photons gets softer . in the terminology of the ll it is described as the `` decrease of the ll scale '' from @xmath17 , which is the square of the centre - of - mass - system ( cms ) energy , to @xmath18 , which is the four - momentum transfer ( squared ) from the beam to the nearby particle of the same charge .",
    "we shall refer to the above phenomenon as the _ leading - logarithmic scale transmutation _",
    "( llst ) .",
    "let us stress that in the calculations based from the beginning on the yfs exclusive exponentiation , as in the bhwide  @xcite or kkmc  @xcite mc programs , the ecs and llst are automatically built in to an infinite order , hence there is no need to reinstall them .",
    "the ecs and llst in exclusive exponentiation are direct manifestations of the interference effects between isr and fsr .",
    "hence , they are also often described as `` coherence effects '' .",
    "as already said , owing to the lack of ecs in the monte carlo calculation in which isr is modelled using the @xmath17-scale , one may encounter two pathologies : ( a ) overproduction of photons with large transverse momenta , which results in the noticeable deformation of the topology of events and ( b ) too strong an overall energy loss due to isr . in particular this",
    "happens in the single-@xmath14 ( @xmath1 ) production process at lep2 , when modelled by the mc program koralw  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this work is to invent a simple method of correcting for ecs , and curing the above deficiencies , without the need of generating fsr in the mc process .",
    "this is however too much work to be completed before the end of the lep2 data analysis . for the @xmath19 subprocess , where precision requirements are @xmath20",
    ", the ecs / coherence effects between isr and fsr ( @xmath14 decays ) are strongly suppressed . ] .",
    "the method is quite general , although its most immediate application is improving the theoretical prediction for the @xmath1 production process at lep2 to the @xmath0 precision level .",
    "contrary to alternative curing methods implemented in the other mc programs  @xcite , our method works for finite-@xmath2 isr multiphoton distributions .",
    "it is not an `` ad hoc '' method because its development is based on the consideration of the exact yfs exclusive exponentiation for isr , fsr and their interference  @xcite .    after defining our method",
    ", we shall also present a variety of numerical results exploiting the newest version of the koralw monte carlo , in which this method of introducing ecs is already implemented .",
    "the _ electric charge screening _",
    "effect together with _",
    "leading - logarithmic scale transmutation _ for the multiphoton emission are described in the following section .",
    "the proposed method is _ practical _ because :    * the effects are introduced by means of a simple well - behaving monte carlo weight , * it does not require generation of the additional photons in the final state ( fsr ) , * it provides an isr precision good enough for lep2 data analysis , that is @xmath0 .",
    "the construction of the ecs weight is first described in section  [ susec : mhamha ] , using a simple example of the process @xmath21 , for which the ecs effect and the method of its introduction in the isr is illustrated with the help of many examples of the photon distributions .",
    "this method is later generalized to the @xmath22 process in section  [ sec : ecswt ] , where also the relevant correction to the virtual form factor ( overall normalization ) is defined .",
    "numerical cross - checks and final discussion are provided in section[sec : numerics ] .",
    "the electric charge screening effect is a well - known phenomenon of suppression of the photon emission from any subset of compensating charges ( charges adding to zero or to small total charge ) , which are close in the momentum phase space , i.e. which have small effective mass , small angular distance , etc .",
    "one should exclude from the consideration charges / particles that are well _ time - separated _ ,",
    "i.e. from the decay and production parts of the narrow resonance production / decay processes . a good example of a subset of compensating charges is for instance a fast - moving light @xmath23 pair  a `` dipole '' of compensating charges . for the compensation considerations , electric charges of every initial state particle",
    "should be assigned an additional minus sign with respect to particle charges in the final state ( much as in the definition of the four - momentum transfer ) .",
    "for instance in the low - angle bhabha ( labh ) process , the initial state @xmath24 and the final state @xmath25 form together a `` dipole '' of compensating charges and the ecs / llst takes place , which means that the emission of photons with an angle greater than the angular size of the @xmath26 compensating system gets strongly suppressed .",
    "the leading - logarithmic scale transmutation is just another face of the same ecs . for isr taken alone ,",
    "the ll parameter @xmath27 , which controls the strength of the loss of the total energy due to isr , is defined for the so - called ll energy scale @xmath28 , being just the total centre - of - mass system ( cms ) energy .",
    "actually this so - called big logarithm @xmath29 comes from the integral over the photon angle @xmath30 .",
    "taking into account the interference between isr and fsr introduces ecs .",
    "this becomes important when , for instance , one of the final state @xmath31 s approaches the initial beam @xmath31 by an angle @xmath32 .",
    "then , the photon angular distribution gets suppressed ( i.e. loses the @xmath33 dependence ) for @xmath34 . hence @xmath29 gets replaced in the so - called ll isr structure functions by a smaller @xmath35 .",
    "obviously , llst is a numerically important effect when @xmath36 .",
    "such is the case of the @xmath1 production , where at least one of the final state electrons gets inside the beam pipe due to the strong peak in its scattering angle ( because of @xmath18-channel photon exchange in the born distribution ) .",
    "all the above discussion was for real photons , and in fact the whole ecs can be viewed as an almost completely _ classical _ phenomenon .",
    "the real photon angular distribution , in the soft - limit approximation , is just the square of the classical electric current vector .",
    "quantum - mechanical virtual corrections merely correct the overall normalization , cancelling properly infrared ( ir ) singularities in the photon _ energy _ distribution .",
    "( the ir - divergent part of the exponentiated virtual correction has necessarily @xmath37 as a coefficient . )",
    "as already indicated , in our method of implementing the ecs effect in isr we do not include explicit fsr ; however , we take as a guide the yfs model in which isr , fsr and their interference are included . in this section",
    "we examine carefully the ecs effect for a single real photon in such a complete model , proposing at the end of the exercise a simple correcting weight introducing the ecs effect in the pure isr case .",
    "the above will be done by carefully scrutinizing several variants of the angular photon distributions of a `` toy process '' : @xmath38 a muonic analogue of the bhabha process , which we shall call a `` mhamha scattering process '' . in the soft photon limit ,",
    "the final state distribution is equal to the born distribution times the _ complete _ soft photon factor @xmath39 the same factor which is a basic element in the yfs exponentiation  @xcite . in order to see the ecs effect we compare the above complete @xmath40 with the incoherent sum @xmath41 of the isr and fsr contributions , neglecting the interference ifi = isr@xmath42fsr , where @xmath43 we choose a relatively small scattering angle @xmath44 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha1 ] we plot @xmath41 and complete @xmath40 side by side , as a function of the photon polar variables @xmath45 . in order to see very clearly the structure of the distribution over the entire unit sphere , we choose @xmath45 with respect to the @xmath46-axis pointing perpendicularly to the beam axis ( beams are along the @xmath47-axis ) .",
    "we choose @xmath48 gev at which muons are already very relativistic and the muon scattering angle 20@xmath49  small enough to see ecs effect .",
    "the four peaks of the photon emission intensity in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha1 ] are centred around directions of the four charged muons .",
    "the ecs effect is seen as a clear suppression of the photon emission intensity beyond the two dipole peaks @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "the first dipole is for the incoming and outgoing @xmath52 and the second one is for the incoming and outgoing @xmath53 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha1 ] the two @xmath18-channel dipole peaks are much sharper for the complete @xmath40 than for the incoherent superposition of isr and fsr , @xmath41 .",
    "the top part of the dipole peaks is worth inspection , see fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha2 ] , as it features the well - known `` helicity zeros '' as deep `` craters '' , exactly in the direction of the emitter charge .",
    "the craters are of an angular size @xmath54 and will shrink to a negligible size at very high energies .",
    "the ecs effect is also very clearly seen again in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha2 ] , as a strong sharpening of the photon radiation intensity beyond the dipole double peak .    is the radiation pattern of @xmath40 , which we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha2 ] , specific to a @xmath18-channel character of the process ?",
    "not really .",
    "the radiation pattern of the real @xmath55 pair with effective mass equal to @xmath56 and boosted to the total energy of 5 gev is completely _",
    "undistinguishable _ from what we see in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha2 ] .",
    "the other way of describing it is that @xmath40 is extremely well approximated by the incoherent sum of @xmath57 .",
    "let us stress that @xmath58 and @xmath59 look very simple and natural in the two breit frames ( rest frames of @xmath50 and @xmath51 ) and the _ non - trivial _ shape of the photon intensity in fig .  [ fig : mhamha2 ] is the result of the _ trivial _ lorentz boost from the breit to the cms frame .",
    "( in a sense , the non - trivial shape plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha2 ] is the `` fault '' of the observer himself , who has chosen to examine it from an `` unnatural '' reference frame . )",
    "the other interesting observation is that if we have plotted @xmath57 in figs .",
    "[ fig : mhamha1 ] and  [ fig : mhamha2 ] then we will have found that it is completely undistinguishable from the @xmath40 at the low mc level , is so efficient in modelling the multiphoton radiation in the complete wide - angle bhabha process . ] . in order to see any noticeable difference between these two distributions",
    ", we have to go to the backward scattering angle .",
    "we do this in fig .  [",
    "fig : mhamha3 ] , where we compare these two emission distributions for the scattering angle @xmath60 .",
    "the peaking structure is the same ; however , for @xmath40 we see a rich interference pattern , especially for photons far away from the four charges . at this large scattering angle",
    "we have checked that the @xmath57 and @xmath41 distributions look almost identical .",
    "having seen in figs .",
    "[ fig : mhamha1 ] and [ fig : mhamha2 ] what the coherence ecs effect is , let us now ask the important practical question : provided that , as in koralw , we have only isr , could we modify the isr distribution in such a way that we get the same sharpening of the photon angular distribution , as in the real world of the coherent @xmath40 ?",
    "our proposal for the correcting weight is the following : @xmath61 and we are going to show that it does what we want .",
    "let us examine the corrected isr distribution @xmath62 first , we notice that @xmath63 ( apart from the unimportant helicity zero ) close to the angular position of the outgoing particles , so it does not try to re - install the fsr , and the corresponding mc weight should not have an inconvenient long tail .",
    "then , what is most important , @xmath64 really cuts off very strongly photon emission at angles greater than the scattering angle @xmath65 or @xmath66 .",
    "this is seen very clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : mhamha4 ] , where the `` angular size '' of the corrected isr emission pattern shrinks by a factor of @xmath67 with respect to the original one .",
    "this is clearly visible even for our moderately small scattering angle @xmath68 . in the real koralw application",
    "we shall , of course , apply the product of the @xmath69 over all isr photons .",
    "the overall normalization will also be corrected by means of correcting the exponential virtual+real form factor , which also compensates for the ir divergence of the average ecs weight @xmath70 .",
    "how does one justify the fact that we apply a correcting weight , which includes isr@xmath42fsr interference , without generating fsr in the mc ?",
    "a quite general answer is that the above can be understood as a procedure of integrating analytically over the real fsr photons and including the result of the integration in the normalization .",
    "such a procedure can be very close to experimental reality , provided the fsr photons are combined with the outgoing charged particles . from the theoretical point of view",
    "the above procedure is quite common in the world of the ll approximation .",
    "for example , a similar solution is used to install interference between different branches of fsr in the photos monte carlo @xcite . as we shall see later on , our procedure not only makes sense in the ll approximation , but also features the precise ir cancellations and has the expected ll behaviour .",
    "we have already explained what the ecs effect is , and sketched how to introduce it in an approximate way in the isr monte carlo , with the help of the correcting weight @xmath64 .",
    "all that was done for the @xmath72 final state in a rather _ qualitative _ way . in the following",
    "we define the analogous correcting procedure for the four - fermion ( @xmath71 ) final state ; we shall also present several _ quantitative _ tests , see section  [ sec : numerics ] .",
    "let us start by defining the real emission part of the @xmath64 for the @xmath71 process @xmath73 .",
    "for this process the complete soft photon emission factor reads @xmath74 where @xmath75 , @xmath76 is the sign of the @xmath77-th charge , and @xmath78 if particle @xmath77 is outgoing ( incoming ) .",
    "the natural extension of the weight of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w_ecs ] ) would be @xmath79 where @xmath80 is defined as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : stilde ] ) , restricting summation to the fsr part , @xmath81 .",
    "the above weight could be implemented in the mc without much problem ; however , it would complicate the construction of the accompanying normalization weight @xmath82 described in the next section .",
    "we have noticed , however , that since we are working in the ll framework , we can simplify the weight of eq .",
    "( [ eq : wtreal0 ] ) , and effectively replace it with the variant of the @xmath72 weight of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w_ecs ] ) .",
    "how is this possible ?",
    "one has to keep in mind that our aim is to deal with the situation in which one of the final state particles ( electrons ) is close to the beam or two particles ( electrons / positrons ) are close to the beams .",
    "let us call the above two situations ( following a long established terminology ) singly- and doubly - peripheral scattering .",
    "in the singly - peripheral ( sp ) situation we expect ecs in only one hemisphere .",
    "photons will be emitted inside a narrowly collimated @xmath18-channel dipole close to the beam ; there will be _ a gap in the photon angular distribution _ extending from the dipole down to the nearest particle in the `` central region '' from both beams . ] out of the remaining three final particles . in the doubly - peripheral ( dp ) configuration , we shall have two narrowly collimated @xmath18-channel dipoles close to the beams and two gaps down to the central region .",
    "in fact the two gaps will join together in the central region .",
    "this gap structure will be clearly seen in the numerical results in section  [ sec : numerics ] , where we shall plot the photon distribution in the rapidity variable @xmath83 .",
    "now , if our main aim is to reproduce one or two of the ecs gaps in isr radiation , and if we restrict ourselves to the ll approximation , then it does not matter how many particles there are in the central region .",
    "what _ really _ matters is how many ( one for sp and two for dp case ) particles close to the beams there are , and at which angles those closest to the beams ( members of @xmath18-channel dipoles ) are .",
    "consequently , in the ll approximation , for the purpose of reproducing ecs , it is perfectly safe to replace the four final particles by just two ( especially that there are only two beams ) . in the dp case ,",
    "the choice is clear : we take those two particles closest to the beams and properly match the beam charges ( form together with the beams @xmath18-channel dipoles ) , ignoring the other two ( charge conservation is of course respected ) . in the sp case one charge is again the member of the @xmath18-channel dipole and another charge we place anywhere in the central regions ; it may be tied up with one of the three remaining particles or not  it does not matter .",
    "the two final `` effective final state particles '' entering the ecs weight we shall denote @xmath84 and @xmath85 , and the real - emission part of our ecs weight we define as follows @xmath86 the above formula , apart from notation , is identical to that of eq .",
    "( [ eq : w_ecs ] ) . also , in the numerator we have used the algebraic identity of ref .",
    "@xcite in order to decompose @xmath87 into six dipole - type contributions .    in practice , the final state fermions @xmath84 and @xmath85 in eq .",
    "( [ waga - real ] ) are determined by the kinematics of the final state ( fs ) . in the case of the so - called `` single-@xmath14 '' @xmath88 final state , in which we are mainly interested here",
    ", we check whether one final state electron ( positron ) is lost in the beam pipe and the decay products of the @xmath1 are visible outside the beam pipe . in such a case",
    "we identify the in - beam - pipe particle as one of the effective particles @xmath84 or @xmath85 ( according to its charge ) . as for the other one",
    ", there is freedom of its choice , as explained above .",
    "since all other fs fermions are at large angles ( central region ) it should not matter which one we pick .",
    "in fact we do something even more primitive : we assign the second remaining @xmath84 or @xmath85 as directed perpendicularly to the beam pipe . in the second ,",
    "dp case of the @xmath89 final state with both @xmath13 lost in the beam pipe , we assign @xmath84 and @xmath85 to @xmath31 and @xmath90 , of course .",
    "let us summarize the main points on the weight of eq .",
    "( [ waga - real ] ) , as implemented in koralw :    * the only purpose of the weight @xmath91 is to restore the ecs effect due to isr@xmath42fsr interference .",
    "* we do not aim at re - creating the fsr",
    ". this would be formally possible with a similar weight ; however , it would lead to an awful weight distribution and a non - convergent mc calculation .",
    "* we get @xmath92 for photons collinear with the fs effective fermions @xmath84 and @xmath85 .",
    "this ensures a very good weight distribution . *",
    "the fsr can be treated separately , either inclusively ( calorimetric acceptance ) or exclusively , generated with the help of photos .",
    "finally , we notice that in the ecs weight we may insert massless four - momenta without any problem  in practice we shall use a massless limit of eq .",
    "( [ eq : stilde ] ) : @xmath93      the average of the real emission weight @xmath94 taken alone is infrared ( ir)-divergent as @xmath95 , where @xmath96 defines the infrared cut @xmath97 on the photon momentum in the cms . in the yfs exponentiation of isr in koralw , based on ref .",
    "@xcite , the ir cancellations occur _ numerically _ between the real soft - photon factors @xmath98 and the yfs form factor @xmath99 ( contrary to typical parton - shower mcs , where they are built - in features of the mc algorithm ) . since it is well known how these ir cancellations do occur , see refs .",
    "@xcite , it is therefore also possible to calculate the ir violation of the @xmath94 , and to correct for the above divergence _",
    "precisely_. at the same time , we shall also correct for the llst in the virtual part of the yfs form factor and the non - infrared ll corrections to the @xmath100 . as a result",
    ", the corrected total cross section will become again independent of the ir parameter @xmath96 , as the original one .",
    "this we shall check numerically .",
    "again , all of this procedure should be regarded as a `` shortcut '' with respect to the full yfs exponentiation with isr+fsr including isr@xmath42fsr interference , keeping in mind that our precision tag is limited to 2% , and that simplicity of the method is also our high priority .",
    "the correction to the overall normalization , which corrects for the ir divergence exactly , and introduces llst in the virtual ll correction , reads as follows : @xmath101 the factor @xmath102 cancels _ exactly _ the @xmath96-dependence and compensates _ approximately _ for the normalization change due to the @xmath94 weight . the proof and details of construction of @xmath102",
    "are given in appendix [ app1 ] .    the factor",
    "@xmath103 provides the llst in the virtual part of the form factor .",
    "the @xmath104 is defined as @xmath105 .",
    "the scale of the @xmath106 depends on the number of final state particles that effectively contribute to the interference weight ( [ waga - real ] ) .",
    "when only one line is modified , say @xmath31 , we have @xmath107 , where @xmath108 and @xmath109 denotes the square of the four - momentum transfer from the @xmath31 line .",
    "when both @xmath31 and @xmath90 lines are modified , we get @xmath110 .",
    "the triple integral of eq .",
    "( [ waga - vs ] ) has to be computed for every generated event .",
    "it is therefore of high importance to be able to do it very fast , so that the monte carlo generation is not slowed down too much .",
    "we have not attempted to compute it completely in an analytic way .",
    "instead , we perform two out of three integrations analytically and the remaining one numerically .",
    "such a procedure proved to be fast enough .",
    "we show in appendix [ app2 ] how to reduce the integral in eq .",
    "( [ waga - vs ] ) to a simple one - dimensional integral .",
    "in the practical applications , a more precise prediction for the @xmath1-type processes requires also the inclusion of the effect of the running qed coupling constant in the @xmath111 vertex from the value at @xmath112 scale to the actual small transfer value @xmath113 .",
    "we include this effect in the form of an overall factor that multiplies the whole matrix element squared .",
    "it is activated only for the electron or positron line ( in the feynman diagram ) for which the ecs corrective weight is actually applied . in the sp case of one @xmath114 line ,",
    "the correcting weight reads : @xmath115 where @xmath116 is the value of coupling constant in the g@xmath117 scheme is used in koralw , the program will report a conflict and stop at this point . ] . for the dp case ( two lines )",
    "we put @xmath118 the precision of such a naive solution is , in most cases ( including leptonic final states ) , better than 2% , and for semileptonic final states even better than 1% , as discussed at length in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in this section we check very carefully that our ecs weight @xmath119 introduces the ecs effects in the photon angular distribution , the llst in the total energy loss due to isr photons , and corrects the qed coupling constant for the hard process .      in this subsection",
    "we present some numerical results that demonstrate the action of the weight emulating the ecs effect .",
    "the first test , necessary for consistency , shows that the cross - section is independent of the dummy ir cut - off @xmath96 of eq.([waga - vs ] ) . in table 1",
    "we show the values of the total cross sections for the @xmath120 channel for a few values of the dummy ir cut - off @xmath121 .",
    "the energy is set to 190 gev , and the cut - off on the maximal angle of the scattered electron is @xmath122 w.r.t .  the electron beam in the effective cms frame of outgoing particles .",
    "one can see that , within the statistical errors , there is indeed no dependence on the @xmath96 .",
    ".value of the total cross section for the @xmath120 final state , for various values of the dummy ir cut - off @xmath123 . [ cols=\"^,>,>,>,>,>,>,>\",options=\"header \" , ]     in table 2 we present the values of cross sections with the ecs effect ( marked with c ) and running of the qed coupling ( marked with r ) for a few energies in the lep2 and future lc energy range . in the respective columns we show separately the changes due to the ecs effect ( third col . ) , the running of the qed coupling ( fourth col . ) and both corrections together ( fifth col . ) .",
    "all changes are given in per cent with respect to the corrected cross section .",
    "one can see that the reduction of isr due to ecs suppression increases the cross section for all energies , consistently with the overall effect of isr .",
    "the running of the qed coupling decreases the cross section by roughly the same amount regardless of the energy .",
    "the relative shifts for lep2 energies presented in table 2 are in a qualitative agreement with the results of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "finally , we have to address the question of the physical precision of the above @xmath1 cross sections .",
    "there are two components of the error ",
    "approximations in the ecs treatment and approximations related to the running qed coupling and higher order ew effects .    *",
    "the approximations in the treatment of ecs are of the genuine non - leading type , i.e.  @xmath124 with possible enhancement factors ( e.g.@xmath125 ) .",
    "therefore we estimate this error to be below 2% .",
    "* following ref .",
    "@xcite , we estimate the approximation due to the naive treatment of running the qed coupling to be at most 2% , dominated by the leptonic channel contribution . in some specific cases , such as the semileptonic final states ,",
    "this error can be lowered to 1% ( see @xcite for details ) . * the other missing ew effects we estimate at 1% , again following ref .  @xcite .",
    "to summarize , in the new version 1.53 of koralw , upon adding the above contributions in quadrature , we obtain an overall precison tag of the single-@xmath14 cross sections of 3% .",
    "this number can be reduced for some specific final state configurations , because of a smaller error contribution from the running qed coupling .",
    "the precision of the ecs implementation alone is of the order of 2% .",
    "such overall theoretical precision of 3% for the single-@xmath14 cross sections lies well below the expected final lep2 experimental accuracy of @xmath126% @xcite .",
    "we have shown that it is possible to improve the standard isr calculation in such a way that it takes into account electric charge screening and ll scale transformation for singly- and doubly - peripheral configuration in the production of the @xmath71 final states , with electron and/or positron in the beam pipe .",
    "this is done using a relatively simple and well - behaving mc weight .",
    "the method does not necessitate an explicit inclusion of the fsr .",
    "although the method is not the exact implementation of the yfs exclusive exponentiation for the isr+fsr , it is nevertheless closely modelled upon it .",
    "the qed running coupling constant for the hard process is corrected at the same time to the correct @xmath18-channel scale .",
    "we also present a number of numerical consistency checks and a sample prediction for the @xmath1 total cross section .",
    "the mc program koralw ( in its new version 1.53 ) in which this method is implemented is readily available for any interested user",
    ". it will be especially useful for the final lep2 data analysis .",
