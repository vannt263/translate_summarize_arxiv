    "charged lepton flavor - violating decays , such as @xmath0 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , are forbidden in the standard model ( or highly suppressed even if we consider neutrino mixing ) .",
    "however , new physics beyond the standard model allows lepton flavor violation ( lfv ) decays . in supersymmetric models , left - right symmetric models and others  @xcite , the branching ratio of the @xmath0 decay , br(@xmath9 ) ,",
    "is predicted to be @xmath10 times higher than br(@xmath8 ) because of the large @xmath1 mass . also , some susy models predict br @xmath11 o(@xmath12 ) , which can be reachable by b - factory experiments of high luminosity .",
    "the current upper limit of br(@xmath0 ) is @xmath13 ( 90%cl ) , measured by the cleo experiment  @xcite . our first analysis with 10 fb@xmath14 of data resulted in a slightly better upper limit of @xmath15 ( 90%cl )  @xcite .",
    "also , the babar group recently reported an upper limit of @xmath16 ( 90%cl ) using 56 million @xmath1 pairs at the ichep2002 conference  @xcite .",
    "data is accumulated with the belle detector  @xcite at the kekb accelerator  @xcite .",
    "kekb is an asymmetric @xmath17 collider with a center - of - mass energy of 10.58 gev .",
    "its current peak luminosity is @xmath18 and the total integrated luminosity amounts to 89.6 fb@xmath14 as of summer , 2002 . here",
    "we present an analysis using 32.6 fb@xmath14 of data , corresponding to 29.7 million @xmath1 pairs .",
    "in order to determine the selection criteria , a monte carlo ( mc ) simulation is performed using the koralb generator @xcite for @xmath1-pair samples and a qq generator @xcite for other physics processes , as noted below .",
    "geant @xcite is used for the full detector simulation .",
    "we prepare two kinds of @xmath1 pair samples : signal and @xmath1-pair background , and several kinds of background samples : @xmath19 , @xmath20 , continuum , bhabha , @xmath3 and two - photon processes of @xmath21 , @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 . in the signal mc samples",
    ", one @xmath1 decays to @xmath26 and the other @xmath1 decays generically .",
    "the angular distribution of two - body @xmath0 decay is assumed to be uniform in the @xmath1 s rest frame .",
    "a candidate event is required to be + @xmath27 + @xmath28,$ ] + which we hereafter denote as `` @xmath29 '' events .",
    "we therefore select events with `` 2 charged - tracks and @xmath301 @xmath31 '' with the expected accompanying missing momentum .",
    "below , kinematical variables are defined in the laboratory frame , while those defined in the center - of - mass frame of the system are indicated with an index `` cm '' .",
    "two oppositely charged particles are required to have a transverse momentum of @xmath32 gev/@xmath33 and a momentum of @xmath34 gev/@xmath33 to reject bhabha and @xmath3 background events . for the signal",
    ", a muon track is required to satisfy @xmath35 and @xmath36 gev/@xmath33 , and to have a @xmath37-probability of more than 0.90 from the k@xmath38/muon detector ( klm ) .",
    "the signal photon is selected by requiring @xmath39 and @xmath40 gev .",
    "the charged particle on the tag side is required to not be a muon within @xmath41 . in order to remove the background from radiative @xmath3 , two - photon and other non-@xmath1 processes",
    ", we apply the following criteria .",
    "the opening angle between the two charged particles be greater than @xmath42 , and for the missing particle , @xmath43 gev/@xmath33 and @xmath44 .    to remove the @xmath1-pair background , we demand the opening angle between the @xmath37 and @xmath31 of the signal candidate to be @xmath45 and the opening angle between the charged particle in tag side and the missing momentum to be @xmath46 . the distributions for these variables",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "a further selection is applied for the missing momentum ( @xmath47 ) and the missing mass squared ( @xmath48 ) as @xmath49 and @xmath50 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ cut4 ] . with these selections ,",
    "the signal efficiency is evaluated to be 12.8% by mc and the remaining rate of background is @xmath51 for @xmath1-pairs and @xmath52 for the radiative @xmath3 .",
    "the signal region on the @xmath53-@xmath54 plane is determined using the signal mc while assuming a uniform background distribution around the signal peak , where @xmath53 is the invariant mass of the @xmath37-@xmath31 system and @xmath54 is the energy difference between the @xmath37-@xmath31 system and the beam energy in the cm frame .",
    "although we used a box shape to define the signal region in previous analysis , we now employ an elliptic shape in order to enhance the sensitivity , because the signal distribution has a tail due to the initial - state radiation and photon energy leakage from the csi photon detector .",
    "[ 2d_data ] shows an ellipse with the highest signal - to - background ratio for a total detection efficiency of 9.0% .    with all selections ,",
    "69 events remain within the regions called `` area '' , defined to be @xmath55 gev/@xmath56 and @xmath57 gev .",
    "one event is observed in the signal region , as plotted in fig .",
    "[ 2d_data ] .",
    "it is not straightforward to use a sideband to estimate the background in the signal region , since it largely depends on the sideband allocation for small samples , especially in the case of a structural distribution .",
    "the backgrounds from @xmath1 pairs distribute in the @xmath58 region , as shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d_background ] , and could possibly contaminate the signal region .",
    "while a negligibly small portion of @xmath1 pairs is found at @xmath59 , the data extend to @xmath60 .",
    "our study finds these to be radiative @xmath3 events , one in which muon is not identified due to the klm inefficiency .",
    "[ 2d_background](b ) shows the events that passed the same selection criteria as the signal , with the tagged track required to be a muon .",
    "we call these `` @xmath3 '' events .",
    "the muon identification inefficiency is estimated to be about 8% .",
    "the background rate is therefore calculated using @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the number of `` @xmath29 '' events estimated by mc .",
    "the background is mostly @xmath1-pair background and a small portion of the continuum .",
    "@xmath63 is the number of `` @xmath3 '' events extracted from data .",
