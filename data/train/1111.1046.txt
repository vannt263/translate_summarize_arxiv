    "however , in lris , two ensembles may exhibit different results , and this is called ensemble inequivalence ( see also  @xcite for spin glass systems ) .",
    "for instance , it is known that the specific heat can be negative in the microcanonical ensemble , although it is always positive in the canonical ensemble  @xcite . in short - range interacting systems ,",
    "the negative specific heat implies thermodynamical instability of the state .",
    "since the equilibrium state must be stable against any thermal fluctuation , the negative specific heat in equilibrium is forbidden .",
    "it is nonadditivity that allows equilibrium states with negative specific heats in lris .",
    "nonadditivity means that the energy of two isolated subsystems is not equal to the total energy when they are combined  @xcite . due to the nonadditivity ,",
    "the usual argument on thermodynamic stability can not be applied , and the negative specific heat and the thermodynamic stability can coexist in lris .",
    "lris also show anomalous features in relaxational dynamics such as the existence of the long - lived metastable states . in order to understand",
    "the properties of those nonequilibrium quasi - stationary states , dynamics of lris has been actively studied  @xcite .",
    "these peculiar features in lris are ultimately related to nonadditivity .",
    "properties of systems without additivity have been less understood compared to those of short - range interacting systems .",
    "therefore , to understand many body systems with long - range interactions is an important and a challenging problem .",
    "the so - called mean - field models ( infinite range models ) are extensively investigated because they are tractable models which display those unfamiliar characteristics of lris .",
    "it is expected that general lris whose interaction decays as @xmath1 with @xmath2 in @xmath3-dimensional space exhibit similar properties to the mean - field models .",
    "actually , many works support the _ exactness of the mean - field theory _ in lris ; that is , lris have _ identical _ equilibrium properties to the mean - field models  @xcite . however ,",
    "if the system has some conserved quantities , the exactness of the mean - field theory does not necessarily hold . in  @xcite",

    "_ calculated the partition function of the @xmath4-vevctor spin models and concluded that the exactness of the mean - field theory holds in these systems both in the canonical ensemble and in the microcanonical ensemble  @xcite .",
    "we will show that these results do not hold in general . in the microcanonical ensemble ,",
    "the exactness of the mean - field theory is not necessarily valid .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions for the exactness of the mean - field theory in the microcanonical ensemble will be presented .",
    "we will see that these conditions are fully described by mean - field quantities and one parameter @xmath5 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 characterizes the interaction potential @xmath6 and is easily calculated .",
    "therefore , we can judge the validity of the exactness of the mean - field theory only by analyzing the mean - field model .",
    "we consider a system described by the following hamiltonian : h=-_ij^nk(_i-_j)_i^t_j -_i^n_i .",
    "[ eq : h ] we consider the @xmath3-dimensional cubic lattice , and each lattice point at @xmath7^d\\cap \\mathbb{z}^d$ ] is associated with a spin variable @xmath8 .",

    "spin variable @xmath10 is a general @xmath11-component vector whose norm is assumed to be finite .",
    "we can easily generalize the interaction potential @xmath6 to a matrix form , @xmath12 , where @xmath13 and @xmath14 are components of @xmath10 , but we restrict the hamiltonian to the simple form  ( [ eq : h ] ) in order to make the discussion simple .",
    "the coupling constant matrix @xmath15 is assumed to be symmetric and positive - semidefinite .",
    "the external field @xmath16 is a @xmath11-dimensional vector .",
    "the interaction potential is long - ranged .",

    "actually , in the van der waals limit , the model is exactly described by the mean - field theory with the maxwell construction  @xcite .",
    "an important difference between ( i ) non - additive limit and ( ii ) van der waals limit is that the system is nonadditive in ( i ) but it is additive in ( ii ) .",
    "the interaction range is roughly given by @xmath33 .",
    "in the non - additive limit , @xmath20 is fixed at a constant , and therefore the interaction range is comparable with the system size . in this case , the system is nonadditive . on the other hand , in the van der waals limit , @xmath18 is taken after the limit of @xmath19 .",
    "this means that the interaction range is much longer than the microscopic length like the lattice spacing but much shorter than the system size . in this case , the system is additive and does not display anomalies such as negative specific heats .    in the case of ( i ) , the interaction potential depends on the system size @xmath21 .",
    "therefore , we consider the limit of large system size and the limit of weak coupling simultaneously in a proper manner .",
    "this scaling procedure is called kac s prescription  @xcite .",
    "we normalize the interaction potential as _ i^nk(_i)=1 .",
    "[ eq : kac ] we can safely take the thermodynamic limit under this normalization because the system has extensivity ( but the system is still non - additive ) .",
    "we refer to the mean - field model corresponding to ( [ eq : h ] ) as @xmath34 where the vector @xmath35 is the magnetization and @xmath36 is the energy per spin in the mean - field model .",
    "it has been revealed that the mean - field theory is exact for the canonical ensemble without fixing the magnetization but it is not for the canonical ensemble with restriction of a magnetization value in lris with periodic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "thus it depends on the specific ensemble whether the mean - field theory is exact or not in lris . in the present paper",
    ", we examine whether the exactness of the mean - field theory holds or not for the microcanonical ensemble with an unrestricted magnetization value in classical spin systems .",
    "we consider a spin system with a fixed energy and without fixing the magnetization .",
    "such a situation is described by the microcanonical ensemble with an unrestricted magnetization value .    in the microcanonical ensemble ,",
    "the natural thermodynamic potential is the entropy per spin @xmath37 which is a function of the energy per spin @xmath38 .",
    "the entropy is defined by the boltzmann formula : s()=_nw ( ) , [ eq : micro_s ] where @xmath39 is the number of states with an energy per spin @xmath38 .",
    "we have chosen the temperature unit so that the boltzmann constant is unity . in systems with @xmath40-range interactions ,",
    "the entropy is obtained by the legendre transformation of the canonical free energy @xmath41 , s_can()=_0 , [ eq : can_s ] where @xmath42 is the inverse temperature . however , in lris , the above formula does not necessarily hold , @xmath43 , due to ensemble inequivalence .",
    "therefore , we must calculate the entropy directly from the microcanonical ensemble .",
    "later , we will distinguish these two entropies , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : micro_s ] ) and ( [ eq : can_s ] ) .",
    "the former is referred to as the microcanonical entropy , or more simply , the entropy .",
    "the latter is called the canonical entropy .    the free energy @xmath41 in the canonical ensemble is expressed as f()=_[-s()]=s^ * ( ) , [ eq : legendre ] where the superscript @xmath44 means the legendre transformation .",
    "the canonical entropy ( [ eq : can_s ] ) is thus expressed as @xmath45 , namely , it is obtained by applying the legendre transformation twice on @xmath37 .",
    "it is well known that @xmath46 is the concave envelope of @xmath37 ( here the `` legendre transformation '' of a concave function @xmath47 is implemented by @xmath48 $ ] ) .",
    "the concave envelope of @xmath37 is defined as the smallest concave function greater than or equal to @xmath37 for all @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , the following relation s_can()=s^**()s ( ) follows .",

    "initially , we set @xmath59 and prepare the microcanonical ensemble of the hamiltonian @xmath60 with the energy per spin @xmath38 , which is the initial state of the process .",
    "then , we isolate the system from the environment and change the parameter @xmath61 from @xmath62 at time @xmath63 to @xmath64 at time @xmath65 .",
    "since this process is an adiabatic process , the entropy of the final state is greater than or equal to that of the initial state regardless of the protocol @xmath61 of changing @xmath66 .",
    "namely , @xmath67 .",
    "the expectation value of the energy of the final state is denoted by @xmath68 .",
    "if we change the parameter @xmath66 suddenly from 0 to 1 ( @xmath69 is infinitesimal ) , the expectation value of the energy is @xmath70 .",

    "@xcite , it was shown that long - range interacting systems can have non - mean - field equilibrium states in the canonical ensemble with a fixed value of the magnetization . in this case , the violation of the exactness of the mean - field theory is considered to be related to the first order phase transition with varying the magnetic field in the canonical ensemble without restriction of the magnetization value . in this work , it has been revealed that the violation of the exactness of the mean - field theory in the microcanonical ensemble should indicate @xmath160 , _",
