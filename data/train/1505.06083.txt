    "the question is whether limits of functions of odd and even numbers reach the same limiting function as the respective sequences tend to infinity . in many - body physics",
    ", the dichotomy between the physical properties of odd and even quantum heisenberg ladders is well known .",
    "for example , the seminal work in ref .",
    "@xcite shows that the spin gaps of odd and even heisenberg ladders exhibit different behavior , although the values are expected to converge to a single limiting value , with an increase in the number of legs of the ladder .",
    "it may now be asked whether one can identify a physical quantity that would have different limiting values depending on whether odd- or even-legged ladders are followed to reach the infinite 2d square lattice . in this paper , we answer this question affirmatively by identifying a quantum information theoretic quantity that does the job .    from the perspective of quantum many - body physics , the ground state of the heisenberg ladder @xcite is an important physical system with a rich topological order .",
    "the significance of these quantum spin ladders lie in their nontrivial intermediate properties between one - dimensional ( 1d ) and two - dimensional ( 2d ) spin lattices .",
    "for example , specific characteristics of heisenberg ladders do not extrapolate trivially from the 1d heisenberg chain to the 2d square lattice .",
    "this is due to the fact that odd and even heisenberg ladders show different physical properties : even - legged ladders are spin - gapped and have exponentially decaying correlation lengths while odd - legged ladders are gapless with power - law decay @xcite . investigating the odd - even dichotomy and",
    "the scaling of cooperative properties in large heisenberg ladders remains an elusive proposition , primarily due to the unavailability of suitable analytical and numerical tools .",
    "quantum correlations @xcite have been used as a tool to detect cooperative phenomena and topological order in ground states of heisenberg ladders @xcite . in recent years",
    ", there have been studies to understand the even - odd disparity in terms of entropy area law @xcite , rnyi entropy @xcite , entanglement spectra @xcite , etc .",
    "however investigating the odd - even dichotomy via the scaling of cooperative multisite properties in large heisenberg ladders remains an elusive proposition , primarily due to the unavailability of suitable analytical and numerical tools .    in this work",
    ", we investigate the variation in ground state properties of even versus odd heisenberg ladders by analyzing its genuine multisite entanglement . to characterize the quantity in the ladder states , we use a computable measure , called the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) @xcite ( cf.@xcite ) .",
    "the ground state of the heisenberg ladder hamiltonian is obtained using exact diagonalization algorithms @xcite for moderate system size .",
    "we observe that the genuine multisite entanglement behaves in qualitatively different ways for the ground states of the odd- and even - legged heisenberg ladders  thus , detecting the odd - even dichotomy present in the system .",
    "in particular , the ggm increases with increasing number of ladder `` rungs '' for odd ladders while it decreases for even ladders .",
    "we subsequently observe that in terms of the behavior of ggm , the ground states of these ladder hamiltonians are qualitatively similar to the ground states obtained from the rvb ansatz . simulating the ground state of the heisenberg ladders using rvb states allows us to analyze the finite - size scaling of genuine multisite entanglement in relatively large spin lattices by employing recursion methods @xcite .",
    "we observe that although the behavior of the ggms for odd and even rvb ladders are qualitatively different , they converge to a single value in the asymptotic limit .",
    "therefore , for ladders with large number of rungs , as the number of ladder `` legs '' are increased , the odd versus even demarcation in terms of ggm vanishes .",
    "however , evaluation of the finite size scaling exponent of multisite entanglement for large lattices reveals that the scaling exponents tend to _ diverge _ for odd and even ladders , as the number of legs are increased , even though the amount of genuine multisite entanglement _ converges _ in the asymptotic limit .",
    "the paper is arranged as follows . in sec .",
    "[ hies ] , we characterize and compute the genuine multisite entanglement in ground states of the heisenberg ladder .",

    "the genuine multisite entanglement of a pure quantum state can be computed using the generalized geometric measure . for an @xmath0-party pure quantum state , @xmath1 ,",
    "the ggm is defined as the optimized fidelity distance of the given state from the set of all states that are not genuinely multiparty entangled : @xmath2 where @xmath3 with @xmath4 being an @xmath0- party state not genuinely multiparty entangled .",
    "we note that a pure state is not genuinely multiparty entangled if it is product across any bipartition . for an @xmath0-party pure quantum state , @xmath1 , consisting of the parties @xmath5 , @xmath6,@xmath7 , @xmath8 , equation  ( [ eq1 ] )",
    "can be shown to be equivalent to the complete form @xcite @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the maximal schmidt coefficients in the bipartite split @xmath11 of @xmath12 .",
    "we note that all possible bipartitions , @xmath11 , of the system are considered in eq .",
    "( [ ggm ] ) , with the @xmath13 subsystem in the above bipartition containing all possible combinations of @xmath14 , for @xmath15 .",
    "the computation of ggm depends on the efficient generation of arbitrary reduced density matrices across all possible bipartition of the spin system @xcite . for states where",
    "the reduced density matrices can be efficiently generated , the ggm turns out to be a computable measure of genuine multisite entanglement .",
    "additional leverage is obtained if the state is known to be symmetric and the maximal schmidt coefficient is known to arise from a selected subset of all possible bipartitions .",
    "let us now consider the ggm of the ground state of spin-@xmath16 heisenberg ladders , which have been intensively studied in strongly - correlated physics in order to investigate exotic quantum phenomena , like high-@xmath17 superconductivity @xcite , chiral mott insulators @xcite etc .",
    "such studies are also interesting in view of the fact that heisenberg models have been implemented using several experimental settings , ranging from optical lattices to nuclear magentic ressonance @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian of a quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg model , with nearest - neighbor ( nn ) interactions , can be written as @xmath18 where @xmath19 represents the nn antiferromagnetic ( afm ) coupling constant .",
    "the indices , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , denote the sites of an arbitrary @xmath22-legged ladder , and @xmath23 are the pauli operators acting on the @xmath24 site .",
    "the notation @xmath25 indicates that the corresponding summation is over nn sites .",
    "figure  [ fig:0 ] , shows an @xmath22-legged ladder , with @xmath26 rungs .",
    "the model can not be analytically approached beyond 1d @xcite .",
    "though various approximate techniques such as density matrix renormalization group @xcite , quantum monte - carlo @xcite , and rvb theory @xcite have been used to compute certain correlation and bipartite entanglement properties , the characterization of genuine multisite entanglement in large spin systems remains an extremely challenging task . under these restrictions , we limit our exact - diagonalization study to moderate - sized heisenberg ladders , upto @xmath27 quantum spin-1/2 particles , and examine the ggm for the one- , two- , and three - legged ladders .",
    "we apply numerical algorithms , within the lanczos method @xcite , in order to obtain the ground state of the ladder hamiltonian , and compute the ggm .",
    "the odd- and even - legged heisenberg ladders show qualitatively distinct features if one considers correlation length , energy gap etc .",
    "we will now see whether such contrast in behavior can be seen by multipartite entanglement measure .",
    "we now consider the ggm of the one- and three - legged ( @xmath22 = 1 and 3 ) quantum spin-1/2 heisenberg ladders as a function of number of rungs , @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) displays the ggm , @xmath28 , as a function of number of rungs .",
    "@xmath28 exhibits alternating behavior based on whether the number of rungs , @xmath26 , is odd or even .",
    "this feature can not be observed in the result obtained via recursion technique of the rvb theory , described later in the text , as the rvb ansatz naturally requires an even number of rungs . from fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) , it is evident that for both the ladders @xmath28 increases with increasing @xmath26 . as the number of rungs increases , the rate of increment for @xmath28 slows down rapidly .",
    "interestingly note that the fluctuations of @xmath28 between odd and even rungs reduces if one increases number of legs which can be observed by comparing the red lines ( @xmath22 = 1 ) with the blue ones ( @xmath22 = 3 ) in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) .",
    "similarly , we also consider the ggm of the two - legged ladder ( @xmath22 = 2 ) , as a function of number of rungs , @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "we observe , @xmath28 decreases with the increase in @xmath26 for even rungs , while for odd rungs , it increases .",
    "however , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , the difference of ggm between even and odd rungs decreases with the increase of rungs , and for relatively high values of @xmath26 , they both correspond to a single line following the same pattern .",
    "the same feature is obtained for @xmath29 and @xmath30 in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) .",
    "therefore , we conclude that with even rungs , @xmath28 increases for odd legged ladders while decreases for even ones .    at this point ,",
    "a question that arises is whether the distinct qualitative features obtained for the ggm using exact numerical simulations of the heisenberg model can be modeled by using the rvb ansatz @xcite .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that several studies have observed the odd - even dichotomy in heisenberg ladders using the rvb ground states @xcite .",
    "it has been noticed that frustrated quantum heisenberg spin models normally possesses short - range dimer states as their ground states . in particular , the ground states of the @xmath31 model both in 1d and 2d @xcite , the @xmath32 afm heisenberg model @xcite , and the frustrated afm on the @xmath33-depleted square lattice @xcite , in certain parameter regimes , are the rvb states .",
    "parallely , a family of rotationally invariant spin-@xmath16 klein hamiltonians exhibiting ground - state manifolds covered by nn valence bond states have also been proposed @xcite . in this direction ,",
    "a more systematic approach was proposed in which dimer models in different two - dimensional lattices like square , hexagonal , kagom , are introduced whose exact ground states are valence bond states @xcite . further supporting evidence for rvbs being ground states of heisenberg ladders",
    "are provided in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "recent results in the tensor - network formalism reveal that rvb states can be used efficiently to simulate the ground state properties of kagom @xcite and the @xmath34 square heisenberg models @xcite .    in our work , we assume short - range rvb states , with nn dimer coverings , as the possible ground state of spin-1/2 heisenberg ladders . numerical investigation of the ground state from exact diagonalization and the rvb theory , for spin ladders upto 16 spins , provides considerable support for the rvb ansatz from the evaluation of the fidelity ( @xmath35 ) and the normalized relative difference in average energy ( @xmath36 ) @xcite between the exact ground states and the rvb states .",
    "for example , for both the 2-leg and 3-leg quantum spin ladders , upto 16-spins , @xmath35 as high as 0.9 and @xmath36 as low as 0.04 are obtained .",
    "these numerical findings gives us a good motivation for investigating the genuine multisite entanglement properties of the spin-1/2 heisenberg ladder using the rvb ansatz .",
    "let us also mention here that rvb theory has been also popularized as a possible theoretical tool to understand high-@xmath17 superconductivity @xcite and are important in investigating cooperative phenomena in quantum many - body systems @xcite , and related to fault - tolerant quantum computation @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum spin-1/2 ladder , with @xmath22 `` legs '' and @xmath26 `` rungs '' on a bipartite lattice ( @xmath37 ) , comprised of @xmath38 sites along the horizontal side and @xmath39 sites the vertical side .",
    "the total number of spins , @xmath40 , is always even , to allow for complete dimer coverings . now if the interactions between the spins are restricted to be short - ranged and isotropic , we assume that only nn dimer coverings are allowed .",

    "the rvb state in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : first ] ) is unique .",
    "this is done by defining the rvb state on a bipartite lattice ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "a bipartite lattice is formulated by dividing the spin lattice into two sublattices @xmath45 and @xmath46 , such that a spin in sublattice @xmath45 has spins in sublattice @xmath46 as its nearest neighbours , and vice - versa . in our formalism",
    ", we require that all nn dimer states are directed from spins on sublattice @xmath45 to spins on sublattice @xmath46 , which removes possible ambiguity in the sign of the ground state , and ensures that the defined rvb state is unique .    let the rvb state , defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : first ] ) , for a quantum spin ladder be denoted by @xmath48 , with @xmath22 legs and @xmath26 rungs .",

    "the subscripts denote the rung index .",
    "since , for an @xmath22-legged ladder , the index @xmath57 is constant in the recursion relations , without loss of generality , we can remove it in the state description , so that the rvb state is denoted by @xmath58 .",
    "incorporation of the periodic boundary condition leads to the following extension of eq .",

    "as mentioned earlier , our main interest lies in the multisite entanglement properties of these rvb ladders . in order to explore this",
    ", we first need to have expressions for all possible reduced density matrices of the system .",
    "the maximal schmidt coefficients obtained from these reduced density matrices allow us to compute the ggm of the rvb ladder , using eq .",
    "( [ ggm ] ) . as the number of spins in the rvb ladder increases",
    ", there is a rapid growth of the number of possible reduced density matrices .",
    "however , the symmetry of a periodic rvb state can be exploited to obtain the maximal schmidt coefficient , which is required to compute ggm in eq .",
    "( [ ggm ] ) , without considering all possible reduced states .",
    "for example , extensive numerical studies upto 16 spins confirm that for an @xmath63 ladder , optimization over the restricted set of all reduced density matrices contained within a reduced @xmath64 block , say at sites @xmath65 and @xmath66 , is sufficient to obtain the maximum schmidt coefficient for calculating the ggm .",
    "the symmetry and periodicity of the rvb ladder ensures that all reduced @xmath64 block , between any adjacent pair of sites in the lattice , are topologically equivalent .",
    "this reduces the computational difficulty in calculating the genuine multisite entanglement as the optimization over all reduced states is now limited to a @xmath64 block , which can be analytically derived using a recursion method as discussed in the following segments .    for an rvb ladder with open boundary , the reduced density matrix of a @xmath64 block is obtained by tracing out all the spins except those at the rungs @xmath65 and @xmath66 , as given by @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69    by using eq .",

    "( [ even - per ] ) and ( [ odd - per ] ) for even- and odd - legged rvb ladders , respectively , one can obtain the reduced density matrices for the @xmath64 block necessary to compute the generalized geometric measure .",
    "we note that the maximal schmidt coefficient is obtained by considering the reduced states within the @xmath64 block .",
    "it is observed that the maximum schmidt coefficients are typically obtained from the @xmath88 or the @xmath89 bipartitions where the reduced spins are nearest neighbors , though there does not seem to be any distinctive pattern that can systematically differentiate between the typical bipartitions in odd and even ladders .",
    "moreover , no systematic pattern is observed in which topologically inequivalent reduced states provide the same maximum schmidt coefficient .",
    "we subsequently compare the ggm of the rvb state with that of the ground state of the heisenberg ladder obtained by exact diagonalization .",
    "note here that although we use the above method for calculating the ggm , the same recursion can be used to calculate other system properties like magnetization , susceptibility , classical correlators , bipartite entanglement and other quantum correlations , etc . a more developed exposition and formalism for the density matrix recursion method",
    "can be obtained in refs .",
    "applying the recursion technique , we can investigate the behavior of genuine multisite entanglement of the rvb state in large quantum spin lattices .",
    "for example , one can study the finite - size scaling of ggm in @xmath22-legged ladders with large number of rungs and investigate the odd - even dichotomy in the asymptotic limit . for odd - legged rvb ladders ,",
    "the ggm initially increases with increasing number of even rungs , @xmath26 , before approaching a constant value at large @xmath26 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ) , while for even - legged ladders , the ggm decreases with increasing @xmath26 , before flattening to a constant for larger number of rungs as shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] .",
    "note that the dmrm approach is not possible to access an odd number of rungs .",
    "importantly , we find that the behavior of genuine multisite entanglement of the ground state of the heisenberg ladder with even- and odd - legged ladders is qualitatively similar to results obtained with the rvb ansatz .",
    "this is clearly seen by comparing fig .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) with [ fig:2](b ) , and the main with inset in fig .  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "the similarity between the two methods , viz .",
    "exact diagonalization of the heisenberg ladder and rvb ansatz on the same lattice , motivates us to perform finite - size scaling analysis of ggm , by using rvb theory , wherein we can handle large lattice sizes .",
    "the analysis would shed light on the finite - size behavior of multiparty entanglement of the original heisenberg ladder .",
    "the finite - size scaling of ggm in a pure quantum spin ground state , @xmath90 , can be analyzed through the scaling relation , @xmath91 where , @xmath0 is the total number of spins , @xmath92 is an estimated value of ggm at high @xmath0 , and @xmath93 is the `` scaling exponent '' with which the ggm approaches its asymptote at large @xmath0 . for an @xmath22-legged rvb ladder , written as @xmath94 ,",
    "the finite - size scaling is given by the relation , @xmath95 using the dmrm method , we have computed the ggm for rvb ladders upto @xmath96 , with @xmath97 20 . once can easily extend the computation for higher values of @xmath26 .",
    "[ fig:1 ] shows the values of @xmath98 and @xmath99 , for different values of @xmath22 , where the ggm is scaled upto @xmath26 = 20 rungs for an rvb ladder of @xmath22 legs .",
    "we observe that as @xmath22 increases , the @xmath98 for the odd- ladders converges to that for the even ones .",
    "this is consistent since the pseudo-2d spin ladders slowly approaches the square-2d lattice , and in the asymptotic limit , one can not distinguish whether the system was originally generated by increasing @xmath22 in an odd- or even - legged ladder . however , we find that the scaling exponent , @xmath99 , for odd and even ladders , converges to _ different _ values with increase of @xmath22 ( see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] ) .",
    "we therefore have a diverging scaling exponent for odd- and even - legged ladders , even though the corresponding multisite entanglement converge .",
    "the diverging @xmath99 , therefore , shows that the finite - size scaling of ggm for rvb ladders can highlight the odd - even dichotomy at large @xmath22 .",
    "the results show that the ggm for odd rvb ladders converges slower than that for even ladders at low @xmath22 , which is reversed as @xmath22 is increased and holds even at large @xmath22 , where @xmath98 for odd and even rvb ladders are indistinguishable .",
    "therefore , we observe that although the value of genuine multisite entanglement can not distinguish the odd - legged ladders from the even - legged ones for large lattice size , the corresponding finite - size scaling exponents are capable of detecting the difference .",
    "to summarize , we investigate the behavior of genuine multipartite entanglement of the ground state in odd- and even- heisenberg ladders .",
    "even though such models have immense fundamental and practical importance , owing in particular to the dissimilarities on the two sides of the odd - versus - even divide , they are not analytically accessible . in this work",
    ", we began our investigation through exact diagonalization techniques to find that the genuine multisite entanglement , as quantified by the ggm , of the ground state obtained from the odd - legged ladder , increases with the number of rungs .",
    "the opposite is true in the even - legged ladder .",
    "this feature is in good qualitative agreement with the assumption that ground states of odd and even heisenberg ladders are rvb states .",
    "we perform scaling analyses of the rvb states on ladders of large system sizes by employing the dmrm , and find that while the ggm of the rvb states on large ladders converges to a single value independent of the odd - even parity of the ladders , their scaling exponents diverge from each other . while the study reported is for the isotropic heisenberg model , we have carried out parallel studies for the quantum @xmath100 model .",

    "<S> we obtain the ground states of odd- and even - legged heisenberg ladder hamiltonians and compute genuine multisite entanglement , the generalized geometric measure ( ggm ) , which shows that for even rungs , ggm increases for odd - legged ladder while it decreases for even ones . </S>",

    "<S> we find that while the quantity converges to a single value for higher legged odd- and even - ladders , in the asymptotic limit of a large number of rungs , the finite - size scaling exponents of the same tend to diverge . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling exponent of ggm is therefore capable to distinguish the odd - even dichotomy in heisenberg ladders , even when the corresponding multisite entanglements merge . </S>"
