    "any three consequitive numbers can be represented by such triplet . out of six possible permutations + ( 0,1,2 ) , ( 0,2,1 ) , ( 1,0,2 ) , ( 1,2,0 ) , ( 2,0,1 ) and ( 2,1,0 ) + we are interested only in two combinations , which represent local maxima + ( 0,2,1 ) and ( 1,2,0 ) .",

    "we are interested in triplets represented by @xmath21 , because it s the only expression , which represents a local maximum in the middle of a triplet .",
    "we shall use a standard cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) @xmath24 , defined as a probability of @xmath25 : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is pdf ( probability density function ) of @xmath28 .",
    "this also could be written as @xmath29 on the other hand , probability of @xmath30 is @xmath31 now , we can write the following formula @xmath32 the first integral declares that the first number in a triplet @xmath21 can have any value",
    ". the next integral says that the number in the middle of a triplet should be greater than the first number . finally , the third integral is for the trailing number of a triplet , which should be less than the previous number .",
    "it s easy to compute the probability as follows @xmath33",
    "@xmath34    @xmath35    we got the same number in both combinatorial and operator approaches .",

    "now , we can compute the probability of the distance between local maxima equal to 2 @xmath56 , where @xmath4 is a distance between local maxima and @xmath3 is a probability mass function ( pmf ) of the distribution of these distances .",
    "notice the denominator .",
    "it is necessary to divide the probability of the quintet by the probability of the maximum in its first three numbers ( triplet ) .",

    "its operator expression is @xmath58 , which does nt seem to represent two maxima on distance 2 .",
    "let s add the number @xmath49 and look at the resulting sextet .",
    "this sextet s operator expression is @xmath59 .",
    "it starts with @xmath47 .",
    "clearly , our original quintet is a part of a sextet with two maxima on distance 2 .",
    "therefore , we have to take into account those quintets , which are not represented by @xmath47 , but these quintets could be parts of sought quintets .",
    "probability @xmath60 in denominator includes those quintets , which would be left unaccounted otherwise .",
    "this formula can also be interpreted in terms of conditional probabilities as follows    @xmath61    , where event @xmath62 is a quintet with one maximum in its head and one maximum in its tail , event b is the maximum in first three numbers of a quintet , and event @xmath63 is two maxima on a given distance from each other .    using the same methodology it s easy to show that the probability of the distance 3 is @xmath64 in order to see why there are two terms in the numerator , consider these two sextets ( 0,2,1,3,5,4 ) and ( 0,3,2,1,5,4 ) .",
    "the following is the table with formulae for the next 3 distances    @xmath65    @xmath66    @xmath67",
    "in order to compute a probability of a given distance between maxima , we have to identify corresponding integrals , evaluate them and sum them up .",
    "for example , computing the probability of distance 4 involves evaluation , see equation [ pr4 ] .",
    "a simple analytical expression for the sums of integrals in numerators of the above probabilities was presented in @xcite ( see equation 3.8 ) : @xmath68 in @xcite a set of similar problems are studied , e.g. permutation generated random walks , by using a different and more generic approach .",
    "however , the equation [ pl ] can be used to to derive the probability of distances between local maxima : @xmath69    we were not aware of this work , and in absence of a simple analytical expression for a sum of integrals in the pmf equations ( such as [ pr4 ] ) , we wrote a java program , which does all required work .",
    "first , it generates the necessary integrals using our operator notaion , e.g. @xmath70 .",
