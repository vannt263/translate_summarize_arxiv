    "star formation is accompanied by heavy mass outflow .",
    "outflows are powered by the gravitational field ( through the centrifugal gear ) and by the release of the magnetic energy built up in the sheared and turbulent protostellar discs .",
    "since the very early studies of the atmospheres of the t tauri stars ( ttss ) , it is known that during the classical t tauri phase ( @xmath5  myr old stars ) , ttss drive powerful and massive cool ( t@xmath6  k ) winds whose signature was first detected in the profiles of neutral and singly ionized species being the most conspicuous the optical h@xmath7 line and the mg  ii resonance multiplet ( uv1 ) in the uv ( giampapa et al 1981 , penston & lago 1983 , finkenzeller & mundt 1984 , calvet et al 1985 ) .",
    "the realisation that ttss drive cool ( t@xmath6  k ) jets and bipolar outflows came in the early 80 s ( i.e. schwartz 1983 , mundt et al 1987 ) .",
    "ever since , it is unclear which fraction of cool wind is associated with the so - called cool _",
    "stellar _ wind ( and which fraction is associated with the bipolar outflow ) .",
    "for instance , the absorption by this cool wind of the h@xmath8 emission from the disc ( produced within @xmath9  au from the star , herczeg et al 2004 ) , clearly indicates that a significant fraction of the absorbing gas is associated with the large scale jet .",
    "though there is a general consensus on bipolar outflows being driven by the disc - star interaction and the disc wind ( see i.e. ferreira et al 2006 ) , the nature of ttss _ stellar _ winds remains open .",
    "hot winds are expected to be produced by the star since the strong magnetic activity and the powerful stellar corona ( preibish et al 2004 ) suggest that a pre - main sequence analogue to the solar coronal winds must exist .",
    "unfortunately , this hot component has not been conclusively detected .",
    "this is caused by the complexity of the atmospheres and the disc - star interaction region in ttss that makes difficult to disentangle the contribution from the photoionized accretion flow and the inner disc from a theoretically hypothesised hot stellar wind . in 2005",
    ", dupre et al , claimed to have detected , for the first time , this hot wind .",
    "these authors interpreted the absence of blueshifted emission in the o  vi resonance lines in tw  hya and t  tau , as an indication of the existence of a hot wind with temperatures as high as 300,000  k and mass - loss rates of @xmath10m@xmath11yr@xmath12 that absorbs the blue wing of the profile .",
    "as pointed out by johns - krull & herczeg ( 2007 ) , the lack of a blueshifted component could just be an indication of the line being formed in the accretion flow .",
    "matter infall onto the stellar surface is channelled by the magnetic field driving to the formation of shocks at the impact points where the kinetic energy of the infalling gas is finally released .",
    "the temperature reached at the shocks can be as high as some 10@xmath13k and the photoionizing x - ray radiation preionizes the infalling gas column that radiates over a wide range of temperatures and tracers ( lamzin 1998 ) .",
    "an independent line of research , the one addressed in this series , was to investigate whether the base of the jet could be hot enough to radiate at temperatures as high as 50,000  k-80,000  k , well below the temperature range of the hot stellar wind but above the fiducial temperatures of optical jets : 10,000  k-20,000  k. the motivation for this research came from the discovery of c  iii ] and si  iii ] semiforbidden emission in the uv spectrum of ry  tau and ru  lup at the same velocity of the optical jet ; this emission traces gas at @xmath14 ( gmez de castro & verdugo 2001 ) .",
    "centrifugally driven flows from magnetised accretion discs are submitted to pinching stresses @xmath15 because the toroidal magnetic field ( @xmath16 ) collimates the current of gas along the disc axis ( @xmath17 ) .",
    "recollimation can drive to the formation of focal surfaces or shocks on the jet axis that are able to heat the gas to the some 10,000  k traced by the optical forbidden lines of s  ii ] ( gmez de castro & pudritz 1993 ) .",
    "however , temperatures as high as 80,000  k can not be produced in cool disc winds . in the first article of this series",
    ", we examined whether the photoionisation of cool disc winds by the stellar corona could cause the observed emission ( ferro - fontn & gmez de castro 2003 , hereafter paper  i ) .",
    "we found that the propagation of the stellar radiation generates a cocoon of photoionized gas around the star .",
    "the extent of the photoionized region is small ( tenths of au ) in dense outflows and close to the disc plane ; however , it may cover the whole wind extent in diffuse winds , e.g. disc winds generated by small accretion rates ( @xmath18  m@xmath11yr@xmath12 ) .",
    "photoionisation also modifies the electron density in the plasma .",
    "the interplay between ambipolar diffusion and the radiation field controls the electron temperature of the wind that is kept around 10,000  k , well below the temperatures traced by the uv semiforbidden lines .",
    "disc winds are a fundamental mechanism for angular momentum transport in protostellar discs , contributing to the regulation of the accretion rate onto the star .",
    "however , most of the transport occurs in the disc itself through the magnetorotational instability ( balbus & hawley 1991 ) : weak fields provide a tension force that allows two orbiting fluid elements to exchange angular momentum on larger scales than the hydrodynamical viscosity scales .",
    "the magneto rotational instability acts like a dynamo , amplifying the field which is lost due to buoyancy , leading to a magnetised corona .",
    "flares associated with reconnection events would naturally be produced leading to the formation of a hot disc corona .",
    "warmer disc winds , centrifugally launched from the disc corona , were shown to be able to reproduce the observed line fluxes and line ratios provided that the winds are clumpy ( with filling factors about 1% ) in gmez de castro & ferro - fontn 2005 ( hereafter paper  ii ) , the second article of this series .",
    "warm disc winds have also been shown to be able to reproduce larger scale jet observations ( see i.e. vlahakis & tsinganos 1999 , ferreira 2004 ) .",
    "warm disc winds provide an elegant and simple solution to the high jet temperatures observed in the uv however , they are not adequate to reproduce in full detail the observed physics of the line formation region .",
    "long tails of bluewards shifted emission are detected in the si  iii ] and c  iii ] plasma tracers , suggesting that the outflow launching mechanism is more efficient and , at the same time , the outflow is less collimated than predicted by the simple self - similar warm disc wind theory . as shown in paper  ii , the self - similar solutions that are able to reproduce the observed jet properties ( velocity and mass flow ) require that the ratio between the sound speed and the escape velocity is 0.43 at the alfvn radius . as a result ,",
    "the radial expansion of the outflow - the main source of line broadening - is shifted to distances of about 10  au from the star , where plasma can not contribute to the si  iii ] and c  iii ] emission because the densities and temperatures are very low and radiative cooling is dominated by singly ionized species ( see fig .  3 in gmez de castro & verdugo 2007 , hereafter gdcv07 ) .",
    "thus , self - similar models produce winds too collimated at the base to reproduce the observed broadening of the si  iii ] and c  iii ] profiles .",
    "the high densities revealed by the si  iii ] , c  iii ] and c  iv ] line ratios indicate that this line radiation is produced very close to the star .",
    "henceforth the radiating plasma must be strongly affected by the disc - star interaction .",
    "in fact , there is evidence that si  iii ] and c  iii ] radiation can be produced in structures very close to the star such as the ionized plasma torus around rw  aur ( gmez de castro & verdugo 2003 ) or the accreting shell in ry  tau ( gdcv07 ) .",
    "the physics of the interaction between the stellar magnetic field and the accretion disc is very rich , and it has been shown extensively that jet launching can be produced from this interaction region with physical temperatures and densities similar to those of stellar chromospheres ( goodson et al .",
    "1997 , von rekowski & brandenburg 2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "jet launching from the interface between the magnetic rotor ( the star ) and the disc is much more efficient than a pure disc wind , firstly because the centrifugal gear is higher closer to the star and secondly because of the heavy mass load onto the field lines at this point .",
    "thus , to conclude this series , we have computed the radiative output from numerical simulations of outflow launching from star- disc interaction .",
    "it will be shown that the radial flow expansion , i.e. the outflow from the disc - star interaction region , is able to reproduce the observed broadenings for magnetospheric fields of about 1 - 2 kg . in section  2 , the characteristics of the simulations from von  rekowski & brandenburg ( 2004 , 2006 , hereafter vrb04 and vrb06 , respectively ) , that are used in this work , are summarised . in section  3",
    ", the procedure to derive line fluxes and profiles from the simulations is described .",
    "the analysis of the output profiles is developed in section  4 .",
    "a discussion on the implications and relevance of the results is deferred to section  5 , as well as the main conclusions .",
    "the interaction between the star and the inner disc boundary layer generates a sheared region fed by turbulent , magnetised material from the accretion disc .",
    "shear amplifies the stellar magnetic field , producing a strong toroidal magnetic field component . this toroidal field and",
    "the associated magnetic pressure push the stellar poloidal field away from the stellar / disc rotation axis , inflating and opening the poloidal field lines in a _ butterfly like pattern _ thus producing a current layer between the stellar and the disc dominated regions as displayed in fig .  1 . the magnetic link between the star and the disc is broken and re - established periodically by magnetic reconnection .",
    "the opening angle of the current layer , as well as its extent , depends on the stellar and disc fields , the accretion rate and the ratio between the inner disc radius and the stellar rotation frequency .    in the magnetospheric models of vrb04 ,",
    "a slow , hot and dense outflow driven mostly by poloidal magnetic pressure is emanating from stellar regions close to the rotation axis while fast , cooler and less dense magneto - centrifugally accelerated outflows are emanating from lower stellar latitudes and from the inner disc . the main difference with the magnetospheric models of goodson et al .",
    "( 1997 ) is that in the goodson models the axial ( stellar ) jet is fast and well - collimated - and driven by magneto - centrifugal processes ( see also hirose et al .",
    "1997 ) - and the inner disc wind is divergent , whereas in vrb04 the stellar wind is slow but on the other hand some collimation is clearly seen in the inner ( magneto - centrifugally accelerated ) disc wind . however , the stellar wind seen in romanova et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is also slow , travelling into a rarefied corona .",
    "a very fast ( warm and dense ) stellar wind is seen in stellar dynamo models of vrb06 ; this wind is mostly driven by toroidal and poloidal magnetic pressure , as well as gas pressure .          though a full description of the numerical simulations can be found in vrb04 and vrb06 , we should briefly summarise their main properties . in both papers ,",
    "the evolution of the flow , magnetic field , density and temperature is found by solving the continuity , the navier  stokes and the mean - field induction mhd equations for an axisymmetric system in cylindrical polar coordinates , assuming a piecewise polytropic model .",
    "dynamo action in the disc ( if present ) is prescribed by a standard @xmath19 dynamo ( e.g. krause & raedler 1980 ) , where @xmath7 is the mean - field @xmath7-effect and @xmath20 is the angular velocity of the orbiting gas . @xmath7-quenching is included so that the disc dynamo saturates at a level close to equipartition between magnetic and thermal energies .",
    "the code uses dimensionless variables that have been scaled using as reference values a typical sound speed of the coronal gas ( 100 km s@xmath12 ) and a typical surface density at the surface of the disc ( 1 g @xmath21 ) .",
    "furthermore , the mass of the star has been taken as 1 m@xmath11 ( solar mass ) , the mean specific weight as @xmath22 and the polytropic index as @xmath23 .",
    "the computations have been carried out in a domain of extent 0.2  au in the radial ( @xmath24 ) direction and @xmath25  au above / below the disc mid - plane ; mesh sizes are @xmath26au .",
    "the inner edge of the disc is at 4 stellar radii ( in the models with stellar dipolar magnetosphere ; cf .  table  1 ) or at 2.4 stellar radii ( in the model with stellar dynamo ) , which in both cases corresponds to 12 solar radii .",
    "the disc extends to the outer boundary of the computational domain .",
    "the vrb04 models represent a step forward over the self - similar warm disc winds models of paper  ii . around the inner edge of the disc , the interaction with the stellar magnetosphere and the stellar wind is taken into account .",
    "also , the rigidity of the self - similarity constraint is lost .",
    "furthermore , the lorentz force @xmath15 is included in the navier - stokes equation , as well as the generation of magnetic fields by the standard @xmath27 dynamo in the disc .",
    "the saturation level of the disc dynamo is governed by the equipartition between magnetic and thermal energies in the disc . in accordance with observations of protostellar star - disc systems ,",
    "the model implements a dense , cool disc embedded in a rarefied , hot disc corona .",
    "this is achieved by prescribing an entropy contrast between the disc and corona so that specific entropy is smaller within the disc and larger in the corona , and by choosing hydrostatic equilibrium as the initial state .",
    "therefore , detailed modelling of the coronal heating physics is avoided by prescribing a `` thermal '' frontier between disc and corona that is based on the observational properties of accretion discs ( piecewise adiabatic model in disc , corona and star ) .",
    "however , temperature is evolving with time , in particular in the disc corona as one can clearly see in the relevant figures .",
    "assuming a perfect gas , the continuity equation is re - formulated as an evolution equation for specific enthalpy , which is directly related to temperature .",
    "the specific enthalpy is then combined with the gravitational potential to form the potential enthalpy .    in a sense",
    ", the disc in the vrb04 simulations can be understood as a dynamical boundary that regulates the extra electromotive force caused by the disc dynamo and taps the mass flow into the wind and onto the accreting star .",
    "vrb04 adds to the dynamics of the self - similar models in papers  i & ii but shares a similar thermal treatment allowing a straightforward comparison .    the full set of simulations in vrb04 and vrb06 explores the role of disc - star interaction in mass ejection for various configurations of the stellar field ( a dipolar magnetosphere or a mean - field @xmath19 dynamo generated field ) and strengths ( models with different stellar surface fields are analysed ) .",
    "the simulations also explore the role of magnetically active discs ( with @xmath28 dynamos ) in the dynamical evolution of the system by comparing the active disc evolution with that of passive discs . in all the simulations , the three basic winds : hot stellar wind , warm disc wind and episodic ejections from reconnection in the star - disc current layer are readily identified . in this work",
    "the radiative output has been calculated only for a subset of these simulations .",
    "firstly , we have selected a reference model to analyse whether and how the temporal evolution of the simulated star - disc system shows in the profiles of the spectral tracers of the outflows .",
    "this is model `` m1 '' in vrb04 .",
    "the stellar magnetosphere is initially a dipole threading the disc but with time can freely evolve outside the anchoring region away from the stellar surface ; the dipole is aligned with the disc axis and has a strength at the stellar surface of @xmath29 kg . the disc is assumed to be undergoing a significant dynamo action with @xmath30 .",
    "this is the so - called _",
    "`` reference '' _ model in table  1 .",
    "the thermal properties of the disc wind at the launching points in the corona are similar to those derived in paper  ii for warm disc winds , i.e. : @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the mass of the t tauri star , @xmath33 is the radial distance of the wind foot point ( in the disc corona ) and @xmath34 is the ratio between the outflow density at @xmath33 and at the alfvn radius ( see paper ii for more details )",
    ". the temperature drops as @xmath35 at the base of the disc wind , similarly to what derived in vrb04 for the _ reference _ model ( see i.e. fig .  2 in vrb04 ) .",
    "notice that in paper  ii these conditions are set to reproduce the observed large scale properties of protostellar jets following vlahakis & tsinganos ( 1999 ) . in vrb04 ,",
    "the thermal properties of the wind are derived from the specific enthalpy , @xmath36 , that is included in the modified navier - stokes and continuity equations ( von rekowski et al .",
    "the system is piecewise adiabatic and the equation of state a polytrope , thus the sound speed is given as @xmath37 , with @xmath23 , and the temperature is derived directly from @xmath38 .",
    "in addition , we have selected a set of models to study the variation of the quiescent profiles with the strength of the magnetospheric field .",
