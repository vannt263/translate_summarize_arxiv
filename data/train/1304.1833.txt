    "actinide metals  @xcite are strongly correlated electronic systems due to the narrow bandwidth of @xmath5 electrons .",
    "in addition , strong spin - orbit interaction within the @xmath5 electron systems comparable to other energy scales renders the understanding of the electronic properties of the actinide metals more difficult .",
    "itinerant - to - localized crossover of 5@xmath1 electrons that occurs near plutonium in the actinide series is one of the most challenging issues in condensed matter physics , partly because the dual character ( partially localized / delocalized ) of these 5@xmath1 electrons is closely related to the abrupt atomic volume variation between the @xmath6-pu and @xmath7-pu metals .",
    "this change in bonding leads to a 25% larger volume in the @xmath7 phase as opposed to a low - symmetry , monoclinic crystal structure @xmath6 phase of pu , along with a variety of unusual physical and mechanical properties .",
    "@xcite    to understand the 5@xmath1 electron delocalization - localization crossover in elemental actinide solids , it is very helpful to gain insight by studying its derivative compounds , which also show other emergent properties .",
    "one of the noticeable pu - based compounds are 115 series .",
    "it has been discovered recently that superconductivity occurs in pucoga@xmath0  @xcite ( @xmath8 k ) , purhga@xmath0  @xcite ( @xmath9 k ) , and pucoin@xmath0  @xcite ( @xmath10 k ) series .",
    "the detailed pairing mechanism in pu-115 compounds are currently under intense investigation .",
    "@xcite we are particularly interested in the electronic properties of puin@xmath3 and its isostructural partner pusn@xmath3 .",
    "the reasons are twofold .",
    "first , the pucoin@xmath0 structure consists of stacked coin@xmath11 and puin@xmath3 layers , therefore the understanding of the electronic properties in puin@xmath3 is relevant to uncovering the mystery of superconductivity in pucoin@xmath0 .",
    "second , the recent experimental capability to measure the fermi surface topology of puin@xmath3 by dhva effects can help narrow down the minimal effective theory for these complicated systems .    in this paper , we present systematic studies of the electronic structures on puin@xmath3 and pusn@xmath3 within density functional theory ( dft ) .",
    "we calculate the band dispersion , density of states ( dos ) , and the fermi surface topology together with the identification of extremal dhva orbits . for puin@xmath4 ,",
    "there is recent experimental evidence  @xcite that the ground state of puin@xmath4 is antiferromagnetic ( afm ) .",
    "however , the earlier dhva measurement in this compound has been improperly interpreted in terms of dft calculations based on a paramagnetic ( pm ) state of puin@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite in the present work , we show the fermi surface extremal orbits obtained for afm puin@xmath3 are in good agreement with the dhva measurements , which makes the theory and experiment comparison more consistent . also with the known experimental fact of pusn@xmath3 being paramagnetic in the ground state , we predict a quite different band structure and fermi surface topology in pusn@xmath3 as opposed to pm puin@xmath3 .",
    "an experimental verification of this prediction provides strong supports for landau s fermi liquid theory and demonstrates the potential toward the detection of quantum oscillations in @xmath7-phase of pu .",
    "the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we describe our theoretical method and briefly review the dhva effects in itinerant electronic systems like metals . in sec .",
    "iii a , we discuss the band structures of the puin@xmath3 and pusn@xmath3 compounds , respectively . in sec .",
    "iii b , dos for the two compounds in concert to the band structures are discussed . in sec .",

    "the tilt arrow just indicates the spontaneous symmetry breaking orientation for viewing convenience . the actual orientation for our studies can vary .",
    "the afm unit cell is enlarged twice with respect to pm unit cell along the top - view axis to accommodate the afm oder .",
    "the enlarged afm unit cell coincides with two pm unit cells up to a 45-degree rotation with respect to the top - view axis . ]",
    "puin@xmath12 and pusn@xmath12 compounds crystallize into cubic aucu@xmath12-type structure at room temperature and have the actinide - actinide distance far above the hill limit ,  @xcite making the 5@xmath1-ligand hybridization the dominant mechanism for pu 5@xmath1-electron delocalization .",
    "the experimental lattice constants at room temperature and atmosphere pressure ( @xmath13 for puin@xmath4  @xcite and @xmath14 for pusn@xmath4  @xcite respectively ) , are used in our calculation .",
    "pusn@xmath3 was reported as a paramagnet experimentally .",
    "@xcite however , puin@xmath3 was originally assumed  @xcite to be paramagnetic but more recent experiments indicate it is in an afm state below 14 k.  @xcite in this work , we consider both pm and afm cases for the puin@xmath3 compound . the conventional unit cell of pm pum@xmath3 ( m = in , sn ) is shown in fig .  [ fig : fig1](a ) with the ligand atoms m situated at face centers of the cell . the magnetic unit cell for afm puin@xmath3 is enlarged because it is the commensurate afm order obeying the discrete translational invariance in the crystal .",

    "therefore , the lattices can be considered as a tetragonal bravais lattice decorated with the basis of pu and in atoms .",
    "the first - principles calculations used here are based on the generalized gradient approximation with the pbe-96 functional .",
    "@xcite it has been well known that density functional theory under the local density approximation(lda ) underestimates the correlation effects for late actinide metals including plutonium metals , leading to much smaller predicted atomic volume with regards to experimental values .",
    "@xcite with the generalized gradient approximation(gga ) , the weak exchange correlation effects are incorporated more reliably than lda . as a consequence , the gga prediction generally moves the atomic volume closer to experimental values since the late actinide metals are on the strongly correlated side . in this work ,",
    "we are interested in plutonium - based compounds ( puin@xmath3 and pusn@xmath3 ) .",
    "as suggested by the dominant role of majority ligand atoms in other pu-115 compounds ,  @xcite we confirm the experimental equilibrium configuration is reliably determined by gga studies with the predicted atomic volumes well under three percent error regardless of different magnetic orders .",
    "therefore , it is legitimate for us to use gga approximation as a starting point to study the electronic properties of these plutonium compounds .",
    "we use the scheme of the full - potential linear augmented plane wave basis plus local basis  @xcite ( fp - lapw+lo ) , as implemented in the wien2k code .",

    "the core states are treated at the fully relativistic level with spin - orbital interaction for all atoms . the spin - orbital interaction for semi - core and valence states",
    "are incorporated by a second variational procedure  @xcite using the scalar relativistic eigenstates as basis , except that the so - called @xmath19 relativistic local orbitals  @xcite are used to account for the finite character of the wave function at the pu nucleus .",
    "dense brillouin zone sampling is used for the calculation of the fermi surface .",
    "we use a 31 @xmath20 31 @xmath20 31 k - mesh for the pm puin@xmath3 and pusn@xmath3 calculations .",
    "a 31@xmath20 31 @xmath20 22 k - mesh is used for the afm puin@xmath3 .",
    "experimentally , a full determination of the magnetic structure for the afm state of puin@xmath4 is currently not available .",
    "therefore , we assume this structure follows that of its isostructural compound : cein@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite this choice is also supported by fermi surface topology of pm puin@xmath3 as discussed later .",
    "the dhva effect is observable in very clean metallic systems , typically in strong magnetic fields exceeding several tesla .",
    "on sweeping the magnetic field @xmath21 , one observes oscillations in the magnetization , which are periodic in an inverse magnetic field due to the fact that the number of occupied landau levels changes with the magnetic field .",
    "the measurement of dhva effect with varying magnetic field orientation is a powerful probe on fermi surface topology in metallic and inter - metallic systems .",
    "the dhva frequency @xmath22 in mks units is related to the extremal fermi surface cross - sectional area @xmath23 surrounded by extremal cyclotron orbits perpendicular to the magnetic field orientation : @xcite @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the elementary charge .",
    "in addition , the effective mass of electrons averaged around the cyclotron orbits can be determined by the damping strength of dhva measurements as a function of temperature .",

    "in addition , the atomic @xmath30 levels from ligand atoms in puin@xmath3 tend to be more delocalized due to smaller attraction from nucleon charges .",
