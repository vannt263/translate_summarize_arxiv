    "it is believed that string theory is a promising candidate for the theory of everything .",
    "remarkably , string theory can be formulated only in ten dimensions . apparently , it is necessary to reconcile this prediction with our real world by compactifying extra - dimensions or by considering braneworld .",
    "recently , the idea of large extra - dimensions in the context of the braneworld has been advocated  @xcite .",
    "intriguingly , in the presence of the large extra - dimensions , black holes could be created at the tev scale  @xcite .",
    "hence , the stability of higher dimensional black holes becomes important since these black holes could be produced at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) if the spacetime has larger than six dimensions .",
    "the stability of higher dimensional black holes has been an active topic since the seminal papers by kodama and ishibashi  @xcite .",
    "there are at least two directions to be pursued .",
    "one is to study various black holes in einstein theory .",
    "this direction is necessary because black holes produced at the lhc are expected to be charged or rotating .",
    "a numerical study of charged black holes has been done  @xcite . to investigate the stability of rotating black holes , a group theoretical method is developed  @xcite .",
    "the method is used to study the stability of squashed black holes  @xcite and 5-dimensional rotating black holes  @xcite .",
    "the stability of rotating black holes in more than 5-dimensions is also studied  @xcite .",
    "the other direction is to consider the stability of black holes in more general gravitational theories .",
    "this direction is also important because black holes are produced at the planck scale where einstein theory would be no longer valid .",
    "in fact , it is known that einstein theory is merely a low energy limit of string theory  @xcite . in string theory , there are higher curvature corrections in addition to einstein - hilbert term  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is natural to extend gravitational theory into those with higher power of curvature in higher dimensions .",
    "it is lovelock theory that belongs to such class of theories  @xcite . in lovelock theory",
    ", it is known that there exist static black hole solutions  @xcite .",
    "hence , it is natural to suppose black holes produced at the lhc are of this type  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is important to study the stability of these lovelock black holes .    in the case of the second order lovelock theory , the so - called einstein - gauss - bonnet theory ,",
    "the stability analysis under tensor perturbations has been performed  @xcite ( see also an earlier work  @xcite ) .",
    "the analysis has been also extended to the scalar and vector perturbations by the same group  @xcite .",
    "they have shown there exists the scalar mode instability in five dimensions , the tensor mode instability in six dimensions , and no instability in other dimensions . however , in the dimensions higher than six , we need to incorporate higher order lovelock terms .",
    "indeed , when we consider black holes at the lhc , it is important to consider more higher order lovelock terms  @xcite .",
    "hence , in this paper , we study the stability of black holes in the third order lovelock theory . in this context",
    ", our discussion of the stability of black holes in seven and eight dimensions becomes complete . in this paper",
    ", we will restrict ourselves to the tensor mode analysis as a first step . even in this case , we find the instability of small black holes in eight dimensions .",
    "this suggests the instability of small black holes is generic in lovelock theory .",
    "the organization of the paper is as follows . in section [ seq:2 ] , we review lovelock theory and introduce lovelock black hole solutions . in section [ seq:3 ] ,",
    "we present a master equation for tensor perturbations in the background of lovelock black hole . in section [ seq:4 ] , we clarify the conditions of applicability of the linear analysis and the stability .",
    "then , we discuss the stability of lovelock black holes for various cases . in particular , we prove the stability of black holes under tensor perturbation in seven dimensions and find the instability of small black holes in eight dimensions . finally , we summarize our results in section [ seq:5 ] .",
    "in this section , we present the third order lovelock theory . in the spacetime dimensions @xmath0 ,",
    "the third order lovelock term is not relevant . while , for @xmath1 , we need to incorporate the fourth order lovelock term , which is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "hence , our main objective in this paper is the third order lovelock theory in seven and eight dimensions , although we mention black holes in other dimensions .    in @xcite , the most general symmetric ,",
    "divergence free rank ( 1,1 ) tensor is constructed out of a metric and its first and second derivatives .",

    "we should note that in order to have asymptotically flat solutions we have to restrict solution of eq.([eq : poly ] ) to the positive one . then , as one can see easily from eq.([eq : poly ] ) , @xmath28 goes as @xmath47 in the asymptotic region .",

    "we note that @xmath28 moves from 0 to @xmath51 .",
    "we also notice that the larger @xmath51 gives the smaller @xmath31 in this case .",

    "that there exists @xmath94 such that @xmath95 and @xmath96 , we encounter a singularity . to see this ,",
    "let us examine ( [ eq : pert ] ) around @xmath94 .",

    "the solution is singular at @xmath105 for generic perturbations .",
    "the above calculation means that if the condition ( [ eq : assum ] ) is not satisfied , then the linear analysis break down at @xmath94 .",

    "when the condition ( [ eq : assum ] ) is fulfilled , we can introduce a new variable @xmath106 using @xmath107 and switching to the coordinate @xmath108 , defined by @xmath109 , we can rewrite eq.([eq : pert ] ) as @xmath110 where @xmath111 is an effective potential .    for discussing the stability ,",
    "the `` s - deformation '' approach is very useful  @xcite .",

    "next , we need to check the sign of @xmath204 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath213 has positive solutions for arbitrary @xmath193 .",
    "we define @xmath207 as the smallest solution of @xmath228 . in fig.[fig : n6 ] , numerical results for @xmath214 and @xmath207 are plotted .",

    ", we have found the instability of small black holes under tensor perturbations in eight dimensions . in any case",
    ", we have a critical mass below which black holes are unstable or the linear analysis can not be applicable .",
    "we have studied the stability of static black holes in the third order lovelock theory .",
    "we derived a master equation for tensor perturbations . using the master equation ,",
    "we have reproduced known results , which give a check of our master equation .",
    "the main purpose of this paper was the stability analysis of lovelock black holes in seven and eight dimensions .",
    "we found there are cases where the linear analysis breaks down . if we restrict ourselves to the regime where the linear analysis is legitimate , black holes turns out to be always stable in seven dimensions .",
    "in particular , for a reasonable parameter @xmath238 , we found no critical mass .",
    "for @xmath208 , there is a critical mass due to the limitation of the linear analysis . in eight dimensions , for a reasonable range @xmath239 , we found a critical mass @xmath240 below which black holes are unstable .",
    "remarkably , the larger the multipole orders @xmath234 becomes , the instability gets the stronger .",
    "it is interesting to note a similar result is found in cosmology in the presence of gauss - bonnet term  @xcite .",
    "we also examined a special case where the gauss - bonnet term disappears accidentally . in seven , eight , and nine dimensions ,",
    "black holes are stable as long as the linear analysis is possible .",
    "however , if we regard the breakdown of the linear analysis as an indication of the instability , there always exists a critical mass . in more than nine dimensions , the linear analysis is always legitimate .",
    "we have found the instability for small black holes for these dimensions .",
    "thus , in any case , we have a critical mass in dimensions @xmath241 .",
    "the results in seven and eight dimensions are similar to that of einstein - gauss - bonnet theory . in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory",
    ", there exists the tensor mode instability of small black holes in six dimensions and the scalar mode instability in five dimensions . here , we should note that there exists no instability in eight dimensions in einstein - gauss - bonnet theory .",
    "however , in eight dimensions , einstein - gauss - bonnet theory is not a complete one in the sense of lovelock .",
    "we found the tensor mode instability when we extend the theory to the third order lovelock theory .",
    "it is not so absurd to imagine that , if we consider the scalar modes , there exists the instability in seven dimensions .",
    "if so , it is natural to expect this tendency continues .",
    "thus , we conjecture that small black holes are unstable in any dimensions including ten dimensions .",
    "there are many remaining issues to be solved .",
    "first of all , we have to give the analysis of scalar and vector perturbations to complete our stability analysis .",
    "we also need to understand the meaning of the breakdown of the linear analysis .",
    "moreover , it is worth investigating the fate of the instability .",
    "as the instability is stronger for higher multipole orders @xmath234 , the resultant geometry would be weird .",
    "finally , it is interesting to consider the hawking radiation by taking into account the instability .",
    "the whole picture of the black holes at the lhc would be changed .",
