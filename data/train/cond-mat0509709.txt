    "recent progress in development of gate and magnetic field controlled , two - dimensional ( 2d ) , graphitic devices @xcite has not only opened doors for carbon microelectronics , but also renewed the interest in the study of strongly interacting , low dimensional , electronic systems .",
    "graphene is a 2d carbon material with a honeycomb lattice and one electron per @xmath1 orbital ( half - filled band ) , whose elementary excitations are dirac electrons that reside at the corners of the brillouin zone .",
    "these excitations have linear dispersion relation , @xmath2 , with a characteristic dirac - fermi velocity @xmath3 .",
    "all electronic properties of graphene are determined by the physics of dirac fermions which are quite anomalous when compared to the ones found in ordinary electrons : the absence of dynamical screening @xcite , a non - fermi liquid quasi - particle lifetime @xcite , and anomalous scattering by impurities @xcite . moreover , in the presence of strong disorder , graphite samples ( which are obtained from stacking of graphene layers ) become ferromagnetic @xcite indicating the important interplay between disorder and electron - electron interactions in these materials .",
    "we have recently shown that because of the low dimensionality , disorder , particle - hole asymmetry , and strong coulomb interactions , graphene presents the phenomenon of self - doping in which extended defects , such as dislocations , disclinations , edges , and micro - cracks , shift the chemical potential away from the dirac point to produce electron or hole pockets @xcite .",
    "the presence of localized disorder , such as vacancies and adatoms , leads also to non - trivial physical effects that must be understood in order to interpret the data correctly .",

    "the magnetic field @xmath4 is applied perpendicular to the graphene plane.,width=321 ]    in this letter we investigate transport properties of graphene under high magnetic fields in the hall geometry shown in fig .",
    "when a high magnetic field , @xmath4 , is applied to a 2d material , the electronic bulk develops landau levels which in the case of dirac fermions have energy @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is a positive integer , @xmath7 is the cyclotron radius , and @xmath8 is flux quanta .",
    "thus , the bulk of the system is gapped by the cyclotron energy scale , @xmath9 ( which is much larger than the zeeman energy , @xmath10 , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 the bohr magneton @xcite ) .    in the integer quantum hall effect ( iqhe )",

    "the result ( [ iqhe ] ) is only valid if the surface states do not contribute to the conduction .    in this paper",
    "we study the integer and fractional quantum hall effect ( fqhe ) in graphene taking into account the edge and surface states of a graphene hall bar .",
    "we show that even in the presence of disorder , when the surface states become localized , they have a direct effect in the magneto - transport .",
    "we show that the quantization of the conductivity , as given in ( [ iqhe ] ) , is not exact by the presence of surface states and becomes dependent on the details of the sample such as the amount of disorder .",
    "our prediction for the fqhe can be verified experimentally in graphitic devices @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ model ] we present the hamiltonian for the problem and show how surface and edge hall modes originate in a graphene hall bar ; in section [ edge_state ] we discuss the theory for the edge modes ; section [ surface ] contains the theory for the surface states in the presence of disorder and electron - electron interactions ; in section [ reconstruction ] we discuss the coulomb interaction between edge and surface states and the phase diagram of a graphene hall edge in the presence of disorder and electron - electron interactions ; section [ conclusions ] contains our conclusions .",
    "we have also included one appendix with the details of the calculations .",

    "the surface mode is dispersive with a characteristic velocity : @xmath37 while edge states have a velocity : @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the lattice spacing .",
