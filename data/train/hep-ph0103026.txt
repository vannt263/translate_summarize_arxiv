    "four - neutrino ( @xmath3 )  @xcite models including a hypothetical sterile state ( @xmath4 ) can accommodate the three sources of evidence for @xmath5 flavor oscillations coming from atmospheric , solar , and accelerator neutrino experiments .",
    "in particular , @xmath3 spectra with mass eigenstates organized in two doublets ( 2 + 2 models ) seem to be favored by world neutrino data @xcite .",
    "although 2 + 2 models are often assumed to imply the @xmath2 or @xmath6 channel for solar and atmospheric oscillations , one might have mixed ( active+sterile ) flavor transitions of the kind @xcite @xmath7 where the states @xmath8 , as discussed in detail in  @xcite , represent linear ( orthogonal ) combinations of @xmath9 and @xmath4 through a mixing angle @xmath10 .",
    "the oscillation modes  ( [ mu+],[e- ] ) represent generalizations of both modes @xmath0 and @xmath1 , to which they reduce for @xmath11 and 1 . for generic values of @xmath12 ,",
    "the final states in atmospheric @xmath13 and solar @xmath14 flavor transitions are linear combinations of @xmath4 and @xmath9 , and the coefficients have to be constrained by experiments . in this work ,",
    "four - neutrino oscillations in the context of 2 + 2 spectra are studied , for unconstrained values of @xmath15 .",
    "it is shown that the state @xmath16 ( into which @xmath13 oscillates ) can have a sizable @xmath4 component .",
    "as shown in  @xcite , these results can be reconcilied to the @xmath3 solutions to the solar neutrino problem @xcite , which are compatible with a large @xmath4 component of @xmath17 .",
    "the mixing parameter spaces for atmospheric and solar neutrinos can be represented in triangular plots , embedding unitarity relations of the kind @xmath18 , mixing , see @xcite . ] holding for the four columns of the mixing matrix @xmath19 , under suitable approximations  @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that is sufficient to implement just one unitarity relation in one triangle plot for the two mass doublets , the first ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) being the atmospheric doublet , the second ( @xmath22 , @xmath23 ) the solar doublet , in our framework . under the semplifying hypotheses discussed in @xcite ,",
    "the @xmath14 does not take part to the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos , so that the mixing can be graphically represented in a triangle plot , where the upper , lower left and lower right corner are identified with @xmath13 , @xmath4 , and @xmath9 , respectively , and the actual mixing is determined by the position of the @xmath21 mass eigenstate in the triangle .",
    "the heights projected from a generic point @xmath21 inside the triangle onto the lower , right , and left side represent the elements @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 , respectively .",
    "these three matrix elements can be expressed as functions of two mixing angles @xmath27 .",
    "the square mass difference @xmath28 between the atmospheric doublet ( @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) completes the parametrization .",
    "when @xmath21 coincides with one of the corners no oscillation occur .",
    "generic points inside the triangle describe mixed ( active+sterile ) atmospheric neutrino oscillations , smoothly interpolating from pure @xmath29 to pure @xmath0 .",
    "the most recent 70.5 kty super - kamiokande data used in our analysis @xcite are shown in figure  1 .",
    "the statistical @xmath30 analysis is similar to that of  @xcite .",
    "figures  2 and 3 show the results of our analysis in the atmospheric triangle plot .",
    "the first three columns of triangles refer to the separate fits to sub - gev electrons and muons ( 10 + 10 bins ) , multi - gev electrons and muons ( 10 + 10 bins ) , and upward stopping and through - going muons ( 5 + 10 bins ) , while the fourth column refers to the total sk data sample ( 55 bins ) . for each column",
    ", we find the minimum @xmath30 from the fit to the corresponding data sample , and then present sections of the allowed volume at fixed values of @xmath28 for @xmath31 ( 90% c.l . , solid lines ) and @xmath32 ( 99% c.l . , dotted lines ) .    the low - energy sg data are basically insensitive to @xmath33 , since they are consistent both with @xmath0 oscillations ( left side ) and with @xmath1 oscillations ( right side ) , as well as with any intermediate combination of the two oscillation channels .",
    "high - energy upgoing muon data are instead much more sensitive to the @xmath4 component through matter effects , which increase both with energy and with @xmath33 , and tend to suppress the muon deficit .",
    "large matter effects appear to be disfavored by the upgoing muon data , the rightmost part of the triangle being excluded at 90% c.l .",
    "the multi - gev data cover an intermediate energy range and are not as constraining as the upgoing muons .",
    "however , they show a tendency to disfavor a large sterile component , that is strengthened in the global combination of data ( fourth column ) , leading to the upper bound @xmath34 which disfavors pure or quasi - pure @xmath1 oscillations . from figs .  2 and 3 we derive that pure @xmath1 oscillations are excluded at @xmath35 c.l .",
    ", in agreement whith sk results  @xcite .",
    "however , the bound ( [ xibound ] ) still allows intermediate cases of oscillations with a sizable @xmath4 component .",
    "for instance , one can not exclude that the sterile neutrino channel may have the same amplitude as the active one @xmath36 , or may even be dominant .",
    "furthermore , for @xmath28 in its upper range , a subdominant @xmath4 component actually helps in the global fit to sk data , leading to a 90% c.l . allowed region which does not touch the left side of the triangle ( pure @xmath0 channel ) .",
    "figures  2 and 3 also provide bounds on the other mixing parameter @xmath37 , which governs the relative amount of @xmath13 and @xmath16 on the atmospheric neutrino states @xmath20 and @xmath21 and thus the overall amplitude of @xmath38 oscillations .",
    "the following limit can be derived @xmath39 which favors @xmath38 oscillations with nearly maximal amplitude , as expected from the observation of nearly maximal average suppression ( @xmath40 ) of upgoing mg muons .",
    "therefore , on the basis of present sk data on the zenith distributions of leptons induced by atmospheric neutrinos , pure @xmath1 oscillations are strongly disfavored , but one can not exclude mixed active - sterile @xmath38 oscillations , provided that the partial amplitude of the sterile channel is @xmath41 .",
    "in the context of 2 + 2 neutrino models , the sk atmospheric data have been studied , assuming the coexistence of both @xmath0 and @xmath1 oscillations , with a smooth interpolation between such two subcases .",
    "it has been shown that , although the data disfavor oscillations in the pure @xmath1 channel , one can not exclude their presence _ in addition _ to @xmath0 oscillations .",
    "high energy muon data appear to be crucial to determine the relative amplitude of the active and sterile oscillation channels for atmospheric neutrinos .",
