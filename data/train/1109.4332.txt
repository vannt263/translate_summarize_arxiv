    "in the experiments of the crash project , high - energy - density plasma flow is driven by a beryllium disk irradiated by the omega laser beams .",
    "the ablation of part of the beryllium results in a rocket launch of the remaining beryllium driving a strong shock - wave through a xenon - filled plastic tube .",
    "the shock heats the xenon gas to sufficiently high temperature so that it will ionize and create free electrons . directly behind the shock the electrons and ions will equilibrate due to the coulomb collisions",
    "this will heat the electrons .",
    "the shock is fast enough so that the electrons have to emit radiation behind the shock in order to satisfy the energy balance equation .",
    "this results in a radiative cooling layer @xcite .",
    "the transport of the radiation ahead of the shock will heat and ionize the xenon in the radiative precursor .",
    "some fraction of the radiation in the upstream region will also transport sideways and strike the plastic tube .",
    "these photons can heat the plastic ahead of the primary shock . the ablated plastic that moves then inward compresses the xenon resulting in a so - called wall shock @xcite .",
    "it is the interplay between the primary and wall shock that is of interest for the crash project .    to model the laser - plasma physics and laser energy deposition in the radiative shock tube experiments , we use h2d , the 2d version of the hyades code @xcite , which contains a built - in laser package",
    "h2d is a lagrangian radiation - hydrodynamics code that utilizes the axisymmetry .",
    "hyades is capable of tracing rays in 3d ; the runs shown below used 2d ray tracing for the laser energy deposition .",
    "we use the h2d code to simulate our experiments for the first @xmath0ns ( sometimes up to @xmath1ns ) , the time of the full width half maximum ( fwhm ) @xmath2ns laser pulse including ramp - up and ramp - down time .",
    "the spatial profile of the beam is determined using a model for the irradiance pattern of the laser beams in typical experiments . at @xmath0ns",
    "the experiment is in a regime that is well described by radiation - hydrodynamics so that the simulation can be continued with the crash code @xcite instead .",
    "this code solves for the multi - material hydrodynamic equations with a multi - group flux - limited diffusion model for the radiation and uses the recently developed block adapative tree library ( batl ) @xcite .",
    "we are currently constructing a laser package in our simulation code as an alternative to h2d and the progress in that work will be reported elsewhere .    the main goal of the crash project is to assess and to improve the predictive capability of a simulation code , based on the combination of experiments , simulation studies and statistical analysis .",
    "the baseline experiment is a laser - driven shock launched through a xenon - filled straight tube .",
    "we plan to perform an experiment in which the tube geometry is changed to contain a circular nozzle .",
    "these experiments and the comparison with the simulations will demonstrate how well the numerical code can predict the shock properties of the following experiment in which a wide circular tube tapers into an elliptical tube .",
    "in this project we plan to analyze the radiative shock structures in nozzle shock tubes in the context of predictive capability and uncertainty quantification of the simulations @xcite .",
    "the demonstration that such numerical simulations are feasible is the topic of the present paper .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section [ sec : circular ] describes the radiative shocks produced in nozzles with circular cross - section .",
    "we contrast the results with order - of - magnitude estimates based on physical arguments .",
    "section [ sec : elliptical ] demonstrates the radiative shocks in nozzles with an elliptical neck .",
    "this simulation is fully three - dimensional .",
    "the paper concludes with section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "a laser pulse irradiates a @xmath3 m thick beryllium disk with @xmath4 m wavelength light for the fwhm duration of @xmath2ns and with a laser energy deposition of @xmath5kj . for the laser spot size",
    "we use a fwhm @xmath6 m diameter which is smaller than the @xmath7 m diameter of the tube .",
    "we are currently constructing a laser package in the crash code , but the runs reported here use the lagrangian radiation - hydrodynamics code hyades 2d ( h2d ) @xcite to evaluate the laser energy deposition during the first @xmath0ns which includes the laser ramp - up and ramp - down time .",
    "while our aim is to simulate radiative shocks in nozzles , the first @xmath0ns is however simulated in a straight tube for convenience . calculating the first @xmath0ns with a straight tube and then transforming this tube into a nozzle",
    "is physically justified as long as the taper and shaft of the nozzle does only alter the radiative precursor .",
    "the justification originates from the observation that the radiative transport from the precursor back through the shock front is negligible @xcite .",
    "the considered straight tube does have a cylindrical polyimide wall of @xmath8 m thickness and inner radius of @xmath9 m filled with xenon with mass density @xmath10g/@xmath11 , while there is vacuum outside .",
    "the beryllium disk is immediately to the left of @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the coordinate along the tube .",
    "the laser light will come in from the negative @xmath13 direction .",
    "we place a gold washer next to the beryllium disk to protect the outside of the plastic tube from the laser light and use acrylic in between the gold and polyimide tube .",
    "after @xmath0ns of simulation time the output of h2d is used to initialize the eulerian crash code as described in [ sec : init ] .",
    "the straight tube of h2d is transformed into a nozzle , see the left panel of fig . [",

    "the computational domain size is @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 in microns , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the two directions transverse to the nozzle .",
    "the simulation is performed with an effective resolution of @xmath28 grid cells using two levels of refinement .",
    "the effective cell sizes are therefore approximately @xmath29 m along the tube and @xmath30 m in the two transverse directions .",

    "grid blocks are also refined if these criteria are satisfied in the ghost cells .",
    "we perform the simulations with the crash radiation hydrodynamics code @xcite .",
    "this code solves for the radiation hydrodynamic equations in three operator splitting steps : ( 1 ) an explicit time step of the hydrodynamic equations using a shock - capturing solver , ( 2 ) a linear advection of the radiation bins in frequency - logarithm space , and ( 3 ) an implicit solve of the radiation diffusion , heat conduction , and energy exchanges .",
    "this code is continuously undergoing improvements .",
    "one such improvement is the resolution change treatment for the radiation diffusion and electron heat conduction , see [ sec : reschange ] . during the simulations of the nozzles these improvements",
    "were not yet present and the original scheme in @xcite was used instead .",
    "we use for the hydrodynamic part of the equations the hlle scheme with a courant - friedrichs - lewy number of 0.8 and the generalized koren limiter with @xmath33 . for the radiation",
    ", we use the multi - group flux - limited diffusion model with 30 groups .",
    "the photon energy range is @xmath34ev to @xmath35kev that is logarithmically distributed over the groups .",
    "the radiation diffusion , heat conduction and energy exchanges are solved with the split ( decoupled ) implicit solver of @xcite using the conjugate gradient method with a schwarz - type incomplete upper - lower ( ilu ) preconditioner .",
    "due to the symmetry in the problem we only need to simulate one quarter of the nozzle domain ( @xmath36 and @xmath37 ) and use reflective boundary conditions at @xmath38 and @xmath39 .",
    "for all other boundaries of the domain we use extrapolation with zero gradient .",
    "for the radiation we use zero albedo boundary conditions .",

    "the irradiance on a @xmath6 m diameter spot size is @xmath46w/@xmath47 .",

    ", however , about half of the incident laser light reaches the beryllium above the absorption region where ablation occurs , while the other half is absorbed below the critical density .",
    "the actual efficiency from converting laser energy to kinetic energy of the remaining @xmath51 m of beryllium is therefore roughly @xmath52 .",
    "the areal mass density of @xmath51 m beryllium at @xmath53g/@xmath11 is approximately @xmath54g/@xmath47 .",

    "for xenon with atomic mass @xmath68 , a shock velocity of @xmath57km / s , and an adiabatic index of @xmath69 for ions gives a postshock temperature of @xmath70kev .",

    "[ fig : circular_zoom ] that shows the region around the shock . with an effective resolution of @xmath29 m",

    "one peak is near @xmath72 m behind the shock and another is near @xmath73 m .",
    "they overlap with the beryllium - xenon and the polyimide - xenon material interfaces , respectively .",
    "these spikes are probably the result of a low - order convergence rate in the interface treatment .    for a high density plasma",
    "the collision frequency between electrons and ions is large , so that their temperature will equilibrate . at the shock",
    ", however , the ion temperature jumps so that the ions and electrons are out of equilibrium .",
    "the ions will heat the electrons via coulomb collisions and form an equilibration zone directly behind the shock .",

    "there must be a cooling layer @xcite through which the electron temperature falls to the final temperature @xmath88 estimated by @xmath89w/@xmath47 .",
