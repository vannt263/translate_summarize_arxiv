    "one can use the pdp - algorithm of the event - enhanced quantum theory ( eeqt ) as described by blanchard and jadczyk @xcite to simulate detections of a non - relativistic electron ( for example @xcite ) .",
    "in this paper we are interested in detections of a relativistic electron in an external electromagnetic field .",
    "trying to define states and a reduction postulate in a relativistic theory can imply a lot of paradoxes and difficulties ( for example see y. aharonov and d.z .",

    "one possibility to avoid ( some ) difficulties is to consider the wave function for relativistic particle not as a function on the space - time continuum but as a function on the set of flat , space - like hypersurfaces in minkowski space ( for example see the papers by breuer and petruccione @xcite ) .",
    "another possibility is the introduction of a supplementary , intrinsic time , the proper time ( for example see the paper by horwitz and piron @xcite or the review paper by fanchi @xcite ) .    blanchard and jadczyk @xcite formulated a relativistic algorithm for events by using this proper time .    in the following we also use the proper time to propose a relativistic extension of the eeqt , but another definition for the state of the system and its dynamics .",
    "the total system consists of a classical and a quantum part . at a given proper time",
