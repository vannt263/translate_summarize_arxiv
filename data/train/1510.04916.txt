    "the _ inverse scattering transform _ @xcite is a powerful tool for solving initial value problems for certain nonlinear partial differential equations . originally developed for the korteweg  de vries equation by gardner , greene , kruskal and miura @xcite",
    ", this method has since been successfully extended to various other completely integrable equations .",

    "the relevance of the camassa ",
    "holm equation stems from the fact that it constitutes a model for unidirectional wave propagation on shallow water @xcite . unlike the korteweg  de vries equation , it allows for smooth solutions to blow up in finite time in a way that resembles wave - breaking",
    "this process has been described in detail @xcite and is known to only happen when the quantity @xmath1 changes sign .",
    "compared to the rather tame sign - definite case ( which shares a lot of similarities with the korteweg  de vries equation @xcite ) , indefiniteness of @xmath2 causes serious complications ( for example noticeable from the discussions in @xcite ) .",
    "many of these problems are already apparent for the prototypical example of a peakon - antipeakon interaction @xcite , which is a special case of so - called multi - peakon solutions @xcite .    on the other side , the camassa ",
    "holm equation is known to be formally completely integrable in the sense that there is an associated isospectral problem @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a complex spectral parameter .",
    "solving the corresponding inverse problem is essentially equivalent to solving the initial value problem for the camassa ",
    "holm equation . for this reason , it is not surprising that the encountered complications due to wave - breaking for indefinite @xmath2 reoccur when dealing with this inverse problem . and",
    "in fact , despite a large amount of articles , very little is known about the inverse problem for   in the indefinite case and almost the entire literature on this subject restricts to strictly positive and smooth @xmath2 ( in which case the spectral problem can be transformed into a standard form that is known from the korteweg  de vries equation @xcite ) .",
    "apart from the explicitly solvable finite dimensional case @xcite , only insufficient partial uniqueness results @xcite have been obtained so far for the inverse problem in the indefinite case .    making use of recent results on the inverse spectral problem for indefinite strings in @xcite",
    ", we will be able to overcome these problems and establish the inverse spectral transform for the more general two - component camassa ",
