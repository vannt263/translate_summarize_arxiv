    "research on cuprate high-@xmath12 superconductors is one of the topical problems of physics of solids .",
    "the nature of superconductivity in these compounds ( discovered more than 20 years ago ) is still not entirely clear .",
    "it is however evident that their magnetic and superconducting properties are closely related . in the normal state",
    ", the conducting properties can also be considerably dependent on the magnetic state of the system .",
    "for example , in single crystal la@xmath1cuo@xmath13 the metamagnetic antiferromagnetic ( afm ) - weak ferromagnetic transition causes a sharp increase in the conductivity @xcite .",
    "investigations of the interaction between the charge carriers and the magnetic subsystem are important not only for high-@xmath12 superconductors but generally for a wide range of other magnetic conductors and semiconductors as well .    the above consideration has stimulated this study of transport and magnetic properties of single - crystal la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 cuprates near the nel temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the objective was to detect possible correlations of these properties .",
    "non - doped la@xmath1cuo@xmath13 is an afm insulator ( @xmath15 320 k ) @xcite .",
    "its doping with excess oxygen ( @xmath16 ) gives rise to charge carriers ( holes ) and supresses the afm order ( decreases @xmath14 ) .",
    "the properties of a single crystal la@xmath1cuo@xmath13 are to a great extent determined by its crystal and magnetic structures @xcite . in the temperature region of our interest ( below 430",
    "k ) , la@xmath1cuo@xmath13 has an orthorhombic perovskite - type lattice consisting of alternating cuo@xmath1 and la@xmath9o@xmath9 layers . in the @xmath17 space group",
    "the cuo@xmath1 layers are perpendicular to the @xmath18-axis and parallel to the @xmath19-plane @xcite .",
    "the charge carriers ( holes ) are believed @xcite to be mainly of oxygen character . the excess oxygen ( when @xmath16 ) is located in the la@xmath1o@xmath20 layers between the adjacent cuo@xmath1 planes @xcite .",
    "this provides hole delocalization from the cuo@xmath1 planes and thus leads to the three - dimensional ( 3d ) character of conductivity .",
    "the magnetic structure is formed by the copper ions @xmath21cu@xmath22 with spin @xmath23 .",
    "the spins at the neighboring cu@xmath22 sites are oppositely directed and aligned along the orthorhombic @xmath24-axis ( cu - cu direction ) in the @xmath25-plane .",
    "the spins are canted ( @xmath26 ) with respect to the @xmath24-axis .",
    "each cuo@xmath1 layer has a weak ferromagnetic moment perpendicular to the layer .",
    "below @xmath5 , the directions of the moments in neighboring cuo@xmath1 planes are opposite , so that the system as a whole is a 3d afm @xcite .",
    "it is well known that in metallic conductors the transition from paramagnetic ( pm ) into afm state usually implies a decrease in magnetic part of electric resistance that causes a kink in temperature dependence of resistance @xmath0 @xcite or even an appreciable drop of the resistance on transition to the afm state @xcite . in magnetic semiconductors ,",
    "the influence of spin ordering at @xmath27 on conductivity is still not understood sufficiently well .",
    "it is , however , known @xcite that conductivity of these compounds demonstrates often a weak kink in the @xmath0 at @xmath28 .",
    "it can be expected that similar effect takes place in conductivity of la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 as well .",
    "the effect of pm - afm transition on temperature dependence of resistance has been noted in studies of some underdoped high-@xmath12 cuprates .",
    "for example , for single - crystal yba@xmath9cu@xmath29o@xmath30 a clear feature near @xmath5 has been found in the out - of - plane resistivity @xmath31 ( that is when current is parallel to the @xmath18-axis ) , whereas , the in - plane @xmath32 ( measured with current parallel to cuo@xmath9 layers ) shows no feature at @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the same behavior was found for lightly doped la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath36 @xcite . in both cases",
    "this reflects strong anisotropy of quasi - two - dimensional ( 2d ) conductivity of these layered compounds .",
    "the behavior of conductivity in non- or low - doped la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 near @xmath14 was approached previously @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite the temperature dependence of electric resistance @xmath0 shows an anomaly near or not very far from @xmath14 in the samples with @xmath14 in the range 250310 k , but these anomalies appeared to be determined by the phase separation @xcite upon cooling into oxygen - poor ( @xmath37 ) and oxygen - rich ( @xmath38 ) phases . in study of ref .",
    "@xcite anomalous behavior of resistance was searched for at @xmath39 by examining the temperature behavior of the activation energy of hopping conduction .",
    "it was found clearly in a sample with @xmath40  k , but for other samples studied ( with @xmath5 equal to 318 k and 275  k ) it is hardly can be spoken about some definite resistance anomaly near @xmath5 .",
    "the previous investigations thus , on the one hand , suggest a possibility of anomalous @xmath0 behavior near @xmath14 in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 crystals low - doped with excess oxygen , but , on the other hand , some crucial questions concerning this effect remained unanswered .",
    "for example , it is important to know how universal the anomaly is and what factors are responsible for it .",
    "we believe that the results of this study can be helpful in answering these questions .",
    "two samples of single crystals la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( both grown at the institute of solid state and semiconductor physics , minsk , belorussia by s. n. barilo group ) were used in this study .",
    "first of them ( no .",
    "1 ) was with dimensions about 4@xmath414@xmath423.3 mm@xmath43 .",
    "the temperature of afm transition ( @xmath44  k ) was determined from the position of the peak in the temperature dependence of dc magnetic susceptibility @xmath45(t ) ( fig .",
    "1 ) in the magnetic field directed along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "the measurements were made in a faraday - type magnetometer .",
    "according to the known phase diagram for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite this value of @xmath5 corresponds to @xmath3 . at this low content of excess oxygen the la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 sample",
    "is expected to be in a rather homogeneous non - metallic phase state ( no mixed - state or substantial phase separation effect ) @xcite .",
    "the second sample ( no . 2 ) ( with the size about 1.5@xmath412@xmath462 mm@xmath43 ) was studied previously in ref .",
    "@xcite where @xmath47 was estimated .",
    "the sample was shown @xcite to be inhomogeneous , consisted of afm and superconducting phases .",
    "temperature dependence of the dc magnetic susceptibility @xmath48 ( fig .",
    "2 ) , measured in this study , shows both the afm ( @xmath49  k ) and superconducting ( @xmath50  k ) transitions , reflecting its phase separated state .",
    "the values of @xmath5 and @xmath51 correspond well to those measured in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the temperature dependences of resistivity , @xmath52 , were measured with a direct measuring current using the four - probe method in zero magnetic field ( @xmath53 ) . to produce contacts for the current and potential leads ,",
    "silver was deposited onto the contact pads and then thin gold wires were glued with silver paste .",
    "current was passed both along and across the cuo@xmath1 planes .",
    "the measuring current was selected ( using the measured current - voltage characteristics ) so that the ohm s law could be obeyed in the whole @xmath54-range of the measurement .",
    "the measuring current @xmath55 for sample no .",
    "1 ( @xmath56  k ) was varied within 310 @xmath57a . the less resistive sample no .",
    "2 ( @xmath10  k ) was measured at higher current @xmath58  @xmath57a .",
    "the obtained dependences @xmath52 ( presented as @xmath59 _ vs. _ @xmath60 ) for the in - plane ( current @xmath55 parallel to the cuo@xmath9 planes ) and out - of - plane ( @xmath61 ) transport are shown in fig .",
    "as expected for layered cuprates , the out - of - plane resistivity is far higher than the in - plane one .",
    "both curves have a clear kink ( or turn ) near @xmath4  k. below @xmath5 , the curves follow the mott s law for variable - range hopping      which agrees with the previous data for la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "the value of exponent ( 1/4 ) corresponds with that expected for a 3d system @xcite .",
    "below @xmath14 , the characteristic temperatures @xmath63 [ see eq.([eq1 ] ) ] for the curves @xmath52 in fig .",
    "3 are @xmath64  k and @xmath65  k for the in - plane and out - of - plane currents , respectively .",
    "the localization length @xmath66 can be estimated from the expression @xmath67 $ ] @xcite , where @xmath68 is the density of charge - carrier states at the fermi level .",
    "using @xmath69  j@xmath70m@xmath71 @xcite , the values @xmath72  nm and @xmath73  nm can be obtained for the in - plane and out - of - plane directions of the current , respectively , for @xmath74  k. this corresponds to previous estimates of the value of @xmath75 in la@xmath1cuo@xmath13 below 200  k @xcite . above @xmath5 ,",
    "the investigated @xmath54-interval is not wide enough ( on the inverse temperature scale ) to determine precisely functional dependence @xmath52 of an exponential type like eq .",
    "( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "if , nevertheless , to apply dependence ( [ eq1 ] ) formally for comparison with @xmath52 above @xmath5 , the calculated values of @xmath75 turn out to be too small ( less than interatomic o - o or cu - cu distances ) to believe in variable - range hopping in this temperature range . at the same time",
    "the simple exponential dependence @xmath76 is obviously inconsistent with the experimental results in the whole temperature interval studied .    in fig .",
    "4 temperature behavior of resistivity is presented as @xmath59 _ vs. _ @xmath54 that shows more evidently the change in @xmath77 behavior near @xmath5 .",
    "it is seen that below @xmath5 the @xmath77 follows the mott s law ( as indicated above ) but above @xmath5 the resistivity decreases with temperature far faster than below it .",
    "this is in contrast with @xmath77 behavior near @xmath5 in metallic conductors where resistivity increases when going from afm to pm state @xcite . at the same time , in some magnetic semiconductors a kink in @xmath77 near @xmath5 similar to that shown in fig .  4",
    "is observed @xcite .",
    "an increasing in activation energy of conducting electrons at afm - pm transition was proposed as a possible explanation but it was not considered as a general rule @xcite . for the sample studied no some definite activation energy exists below or above @xmath5 , so we can not apply this explanation .",
    "magnetoresistance ( mr ) was measured in this study using a rotating kapitza electromagnet with the highest field 1.7  t. in the interval 170400 k in fields up to 1.7  t , the mr was very low ( @xmath78 ) .",
    "this does not permit to judge about an anomaly in the mr behavior near @xmath14 .",
    "it can not be excluded , however , that in rather strong fields mr of la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 could reveal some anomalous behavior near @xmath14 .",
    "the possibility of such anomaly caused by the spin disorder influencing the mobility of charge carriers was discussed in @xcite .",
    "an anomaly in the out - of plane mr ( @xmath79 ) upon crossing @xmath5 with changing in temperature was found actually in single - crystal yba@xmath9cu@xmath29o@xmath30 for both the in - plane and out - of - plane orientations of the field @xcite . a rather high magnetic field ,",
    "@xmath80  t , was needed , however , in this case to increase mr magnitude up to about @xmath81 below @xmath5 and to reveal clearly enough this effect @xcite .",
    "the effect of magnetic ordering on the hopping conduction of magnetic semiconductors should be analyzed taking into account the type of magnetic order and the origin of charge carriers .",
    "the nature of holes in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 is not completely clear so far ( see the discussion in @xcite ) . although it is commonly supposed that the holes in la@xmath1cuo@xmath82 are mainly of oxygen character @xcite , the overlapping of the @xmath83- and @xmath84-orbitals and the @xmath83- and @xmath84-band hybridization @xcite can also have an appreciable effect on the nature and motion of holes .",
    "it is known that in high-@xmath51 cuprates the afm order and the charge carriers ( holes ) are antagonistic to each other @xcite . on the one hand , at @xmath85 holes of any type , in addition to lattice distortion and the related polaron effects , can cause considerable distortion of the afm order in cuprates @xcite .",
    "the hole can have a spin and its motion can add to the disturbance of the afm order ( frustration effect ) @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the afm order impedes the motion of the holes .    above @xmath14 ,",
    "the long - range 3d afm order starts to decay quickly @xcite though the 2d afm correlations can persist in the cuo@xmath1 planes even far above @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "it can be suggested , therefore , that in cuprates with weak coupling between the cuo@xmath1 layers ( quasi-2d conductors with strong conductivity anisotropy ) some feature at @xmath86 is expected only for the out - of - plane conductivity , when the interlayer exchange coupling is destroyed above @xmath5 .",
    "for the in - plane conductivity nothing special is to expect since 2d intralayer afm correlation still exists even far above @xmath5 .",
    "this type of behavior was really seen in quasi-2d cuprates like yba@xmath9cu@xmath29o@xmath30 @xcite and lightly - doped la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath36 @xcite , where features at @xmath28 were found only in the out - of - plane resistivity but not in the in - plane one . by contrast , the observed variations in conductivity near @xmath5 in the sample studied manifest that the destruction of the 3d afm order by thermal fluctuations impacts on conductivity in both the in - plane and out - of - plane directions ( figs . 3 and 4 ) .",
    "this is not surprising due to specific influence of oxygen holes which leads to 3d character of hopping conductivity in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with excess oxygen @xcite as it is mentioned above .    in low - doped",
    "la@xmath34sr@xmath87cuo@xmath13 the hole mobility increases as the afm correlation length @xmath88 decreases , i.e. as the afm order grows weaker @xcite . at the same time , it is known @xcite that in la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 and low - doped la@xmath34sr@xmath87cuo@xmath13 the length @xmath88 is practically independent on temperature below @xmath89 300 k. however , above @xmath5 , it decreases drastically with rising temperature @xcite .",
    "thus , the change in the behavior of conductivity at temperature exceeding @xmath14 ( figs . 3 and 4 ) can be related to the decrease in the afm correlation length and the corresponding enhancement of the hole mobility in this temperature region .",
    "it should be noted that some of the authors of this article have observed more than once the @xmath0 of la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 ( with @xmath14 in the range 180280  k ) behaving near _ _ t__@xmath90 as in fig . 3",
    "( e.g. , see @xcite ) . the study of ref .",
    "@xcite was done , however , only up to 300 k , so that this effect does not appear quite clearly . in this",
    "study the temperature interval was extended to 430 k. this made possible to see the change in behavior of @xmath0 near @xmath5 more clearly and allowed us to relate it to the decrease in the afm correlation length above @xmath14 .",
    "it is significant as well that behavior of @xmath0 near nel temperature quite similar to that shown in fig .",
    "3 was found in other magnetic oxides like manganites ( la@xmath91ca@xmath92mno@xmath29 @xcite ) or cuprates with variable - range hopping transport ( y@xmath93pr@xmath94ba@xmath9cu@xmath29o@xmath95 @xcite , yba@xmath9cu@xmath29o@xmath30 @xcite , la@xmath34sr@xmath35cuo@xmath36 @xcite ) .",
    "it seems therefore that particular features of the change in temperature behavior of hopping conduction of la@xmath1cuo@xmath13 near @xmath5 found in this study ( variable - range hopping below @xmath5 and progressive decreasing in resistivity with temperature above @xmath5 ) is perhaps a common property of magnetic semiconducting oxides with perovskite - like lattice .",
    "[ [ sample - la_2cuo_4delta - with - delta - approx-0.05-and - t_napprox-205k ] ] sample la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 with @xmath6 and @xmath10  k ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    as it is mentioned above , this sample is inhomogeneous consisting of a mixture of afm and superconducting phases , which is reflected in the temperature behavior of the dc susceptibility @xmath96 ( fig .",
    "2 ) . let us consider at first the temperature dependence @xmath52 recorded in the in - plane current direction ( fig .",
    "5 ) which is found to be in complete concordance with @xmath96 , showing resistive superconducting transition with @xmath97  k and clear feature ( kink ) near @xmath10  k.    on the whole , this sample ( no .",
    "2 ) is much ( @xmath98 ) less resistive than the sample no .  1 with @xmath56  k ( compare figs .",
    "3 and 5 ) . nevertheless , the variable - range hopping [ @xmath99 is also revealed in this sample in the range between @xmath51 and @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "5 ) . in the same way as for the sample",
    "1 , an increased drop in resistivity with temperature is seen above @xmath5 ; furthermore , far enough above @xmath5 ( at @xmath100  k , where resistance minimum shows up ) a transition from non - metallic ( @xmath101 ) to metallic ( @xmath102 ) temperature behavior of @xmath77 takes place .",
    "resistive superconducting transition in the in - plane direction is fairly sharp ( fig .",
    "5 ) with @xmath103  k defined as the temperature of the inflection point of @xmath77 curve ( which was found using derivative ) . in low - temperature range of the resistive transition ( at @xmath104  k ) some clear `` shoulder '' in @xmath77 can be seen , as that commonly observed in granular ( low- and high-@xmath51 ) superconductors with a rather weak connection between grains @xcite .",
    "thus it can be thought that superconducting regions in this inhomogeneous sample make some sufficiently continuous chain to show the rather sharp resistive superconducting transition .",
    "on the other hand , however , some links of this chain are weak which determines the shoulder in low - temperature part of the resistive transition curve @xcite",
    ". the indicated features of the resistive transition ( the  shoulder `` together with non - zero resistance even at lowest temperature of this study ) reflect unambiguously two - phase ( phase - separated ) state of the sample , in which some of the superconducting ' ' grains  ( clusters ) are isolated within afm matrix .",
    "the resistivity in the out - of - plane @xmath105 direction is ( same as for sample no .",
    "1 ) much larger than that for the in - plane one ( fig . 6 ) . nevertheless , the temperature dependence of resistivity has main features similar to those in the in - plane current direction .",
    "superconductivity shows itself as a considerable drop of resistance when approaching the temperature @xmath103  k from above .",
    "the resistance , however , does not come down to zero , which is an evidence of higher phase inhomogeneity in this direction , so that a continuous superconducting chain is not formed .",
    "change in @xmath77 behavior after elevation of temperature above @xmath5 is identical to that for the in - plane current direction .",
    "even a transition from nonmetallic to metallic @xmath77 behavior takes place ( resistance minimum at @xmath106  k ) .",
    "the results obtained demonstrate clear interrelation between the magnetic and conducting properties of low - doped la@xmath1cuo@xmath2 . both samples ,",
    "although significantly different in resistivity and @xmath5 , show the same characteristic changing in transport properties above @xmath5 : system becomes less resistive and more metallic . in sample no . 2",
    "even a nonmetal - metal transition takes place far enough above @xmath5 .",
    "this conforms with known theoretical concepts and some experiments @xcite . according to these ,",
    "the afm order enhances hole localization while thermal destruction of the afm order induces delocalization of charge carriers , so that above @xmath5 a system can approach metallic state with increasing temperature . at @xmath28",
    "only interplane afm order disappears ; whereas , the in - plane afm can survive even rather far above @xmath5 . at the same time , the afm correlation length @xmath107 decreases drastically with temperature above @xmath5 @xcite and this should be accompanied with enhancement of the hole mobility @xcite .",
    "strong increase in conductivity above @xmath5 can lead in some cases to nonmetal - metal transition as it is observed in this study .",
