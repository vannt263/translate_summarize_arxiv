    "<S> first - principles calculations have been performed for the exchange interaction and exchange force between two magnetic fe(100 ) thin films . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the magnitude of the calculated exchange force is of the order of @xmath0n at @xmath1 and of the order of @xmath2n at @xmath3 , where @xmath4 denotes the distance between surfaces of the two thin films and @xmath5 the lattice constant of bulk fe . </S>",
    "<S> the obtained forces are sufficiently larger than the sensitivity of the current atomic force microscopy of @xmath6n , which suggests the feasibility of the _ exchange force microscopy_.    * i. introduction *    surface magnetism has attracted much attention both in fundamental and applied researches . </S>",
    "<S> experimental techniques to investigate the magnetic structure of the surface having been developed , mainly detect the spin polarization of electrons emitted from surface and the average magnetization on sample surface within a sub - micron range is usually observed . </S>",
    "<S> none of the techniques has so far probed the local magnetic structure in an atomic scale .    the scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm)@xcite and the atomic force microscopy ( afm)@xcite provide us with a way to investigate the surface structure with atomic resolution . the stm probes the surface of conducting materials by measuring tunneling current between the tip and sample , whereas the afm senses the atomic force between them . </S>",
    "<S> the afm has a great advantage that it can be applied not only to conducting materials but also to insulators . </S>",
    "<S> the extension of the stm to measurements of the magnetic structure , the so - called spin - polarized stm ( sp - stm ) , is currently being developed by various groups with different approaches.@xcite    the magnetic force microscopy ( mfm)@xcite detects the force arising from the long - range interaction between magnetic dipoles of the tip and sample . </S>",
    "<S> the typical tip - sample separations in the mfm are of the order of more than 10 nm and the spatial resolution is of the order of 10 nm to 100 nm . </S>",
    "<S> it is fairly certain that improvement of the resolution might be made by probing the short - range exchange force rather than the long - range magnetic dipole force.@xcite    in previous papers,@xcite we pointed out the possibility of the _ exchange force microscopy _ ( efm ) which probes the short - range exchange force between the tip and sample . since microscopic understanding of the exchange interaction between the tip and sample is of great importance and crucial in designing the efm , we previously studied the exchange interaction between ferromagnetic tip and ferromagnetic sample based on a one - dimensional electron gas model.@xcite by using a tight - binding model , ness and gautier@xcite calculated the exchange interaction between a ferromagnetic fe tip and magnetic cr(001 ) and ni(001 ) surfaces . since these calculations inevitably employ semi - phenomenological parameters , it is highly desirable to make @xmath7 evaluation of the exchange interaction and the exchange force for more realistic systems on the basis of first - principles electronic structure calculations , which is the purpose of the present paper .    </S>",
    "<S> the paper is organized as follows : in sec.ii we discuss the adopted model and calculation method . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated results are presented in sec.iii . </S>",
    "<S> the final sec.iv is devoted to conclusion and discussion .    * </S>",
    "<S> ii . method of calculation </S>",
    "<S> *    by modeling the tip and samples to be used in actual experiments , we adopt the two three - atomic - layer fe(100 ) films which are separated by the distance @xmath4 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> surface atoms of the one film are assumed to be facing the hollow sites on the surface of the other film . </S>",
    "<S> the translational symmetry is preserved in the surface - normal ( @xmath8 ) direction , in which a set of the two three - layer films are periodically located with the five - atomic - layer vacuum gap ( repeated slab model ) . for a calculation of the electronic structure of the adopted films , </S>",
    "<S> we employ the local - spin - density approximation to the density - functional theory , and the linear augmented - plane - wave ( lapw ) method@xcite with hedin - lundquist exchange correlation.@xcite the potential and charge density are expanded with plane waves in the whole space and with spherical waves inside muffin - tin spheres , and the force is calculated by following the prescription given by soler and williams.@xcite because bulk fe is in the ferromagnetic ground state , magnetic moments in each three - layer film is taken to be in the ferromagnetic alignment . as far as the relative orientation of moments in the two films </S>",
    "<S> are concerned , however , we consider the parallel ( p ) and anti - parallel ( ap ) configurations in order to calculate the exchange interaction and the exchange force between the two magnetic films . </S>",
    "<S> our lapw calculations are carried out by changing the film - film separation @xmath4 from 1.4to 5.0with an assumption that the internal atomic coordinates of each film are rigidly fixed .    </S>",
    "<S> * iii </S>",
    "<S> . calculated results *    _ a. magnetic moments _    </S>",
    "<S> we discuss first the magnetic moments in the adopted fe thin films . </S>",
    "<S> figure [ fig2 ] shows the spin magnetic moments calculated within the muffin - tin spheres of fe atoms in the three layers of the upper film , which are referred to as the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 layers ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] ) . the film - film separation @xmath4 in the abscissa is denoted relative to the lattice constant of bulk fe ( @xmath5 = 2.83 ) . </S>",
    "<S> we should note that the separation of @xmath12 corresponds just to the interlayer distance of bulk fe . </S>",
    "<S> due to the symmetry in our model , the magnetic moments in the @xmath13 layer of the lower film are the same as those in the @xmath14 layer of the upper film in the p configuration , while in the ap configuration those in the @xmath13 layer has the same magnitude but with the opposite sign as those in the @xmath14 layer . for both p and ap configurations , the magnetic moments at the outer @xmath11 layer </S>",
    "<S> is enhanced to be about @xmath15 , which is almost identical to the surface magnetic moment obtained by slab calculations.@xcite the magnetic moments at the central @xmath10 layer is about @xmath16 , which is close to the experimental bulk value and to calculated one at the central layer of the slab.@xcite the magnetic moments of the @xmath10 and @xmath11 layers for both p and ap configurations are almost independent of the film - film separation . on the contrary , magnetic moments on the @xmath9 layer change considerably at @xmath17 , where the magnetic moments reduce significantly from the surface value to the bulk one as decreasing @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the change in the magnitude of moments of the @xmath9 layer becomes insignificant for @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> we notice that the magnetic moments for the ap configuration are always smaller than that for the p configuration .    _ </S>",
    "<S> b. exchange interaction _    the total energies , @xmath19 and @xmath20 , for the p and ap configurations </S>",
    "<S> are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] as a function of @xmath21 . when the films are moved from the bulk position at @xmath22 , the total energies for both @xmath19 and @xmath20 increase . the exchange interaction energy , @xmath23 , defined by @xmath24 is also plotted in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] . in the all region ( @xmath25 ) investigated , we get the positive @xmath23 , which means that the p configuration is more favorable than the ap one . </S>",
    "<S> this is expected from the fact that the resulting magnetic configuration corresponds to a natural stacking of ferromagnetic fe in bulk . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction energy has an rkky - type oscillation@xcite with a period of about @xmath26 ( @xmath27 2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the peak values of @xmath28 are @xmath29ev at @xmath30 and @xmath31ev at @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> note that the exchange interaction can be realized even at relatively far separation at @xmath33 ( 4.0@xmath345.0 ) .    _ c. exchange force </S>",
    "<S> _    figure [ fig4 ] shows the atomic forces acting on atoms at the @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 layers of the upper film . </S>",
    "<S> the force direction is perpendicular to the film surface due to symmetry . as in the case of magnetic moments ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] ) , the atomic force for the @xmath9 layer has a significant @xmath4 dependence whereas forces for the @xmath10 and @xmath11 layers are almost independent of @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> the total forces summed up these forces : @xmath35 , for the p and af configurations , are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig5 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the exchange force defined by @xmath36 has an oscillation against @xmath21 with the period of about @xmath37 , which is identical with the period of the exchange interaction ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitudes of the first and second peaks are @xmath38 n and @xmath39 n , respectively . in the case of @xmath1 , where the relevant @xmath4 orbitals must have a large overlap , the exchange force may arise from the direct exchange couplings between @xmath4 states of the two films . in the case of @xmath18 , </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the exchange coupling is expected to be mediated through delocalized @xmath40 and @xmath41 electrons .    * </S>",
    "<S> iv . conclusion and discussion *    in summary , we have performed the first - principles calculation of the exchange interaction and the exchange force between two magnetic fe(100 ) thin films , to show that the magnitude of the calculated exchange force is of the order of @xmath42 at @xmath1 while it is of the order of @xmath43n at @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it has been shown that at @xmath44 , the perturbation of the approaching ferromagnetic film to magnetic moments in the other film , is negligibly small . </S>",
    "<S> the calculated magnitude of the exchange force is in fairly good agreement with our previous result of @xmath45 in spite of a crudeness of the one - dimensional electron - gas model.@xcite@xcite our result is also comparable with the exchange force of @xmath46 between a fe tip and cr(100 ) surface calculated by ness and gautier@xcite with the use of the tight - binding model . </S>",
    "<S> because the sensitivity of the current afm is of the order of @xmath47 to @xmath48n@xcite our calculation suggests the possibility of the efm , although it would be necessary to take into account an actual shape of the apex tip before we deduce definite conclusions . </S>",
    "<S> ness and gautier have been pointed out@xcite that magnitudes of the exchange energy and force do not strongly depend on the tip morphology , although tip s shape varies the tip - sample distance where exchange interaction and force have the maximum values . </S>",
    "<S> it has been also shown@xcite from calculations adopting sharp and blunt tips that an atomically sharp tip is not necessary for an actual observation with a constant - force mode , although a sharp tip is indispensable for a high , lateral spatial resolution . </S>",
    "<S> these results@xcite justify , to some extent , our calculation employing a thin film as a tip ; a first - principles calculation adopting more realistic tips is under consideration .    in actual measurements of the surface magnetic structure by using the efm </S>",
    "<S> , we would have the two possibilities : a constant - force mode and a constant - distance mode , just as in the stm.@xcite in the constant - force mode , we detect the variation of the tip - sample distance due to the force difference between the parallel and anti - parallel configurations . such a experiment@xcite has been made to detect the antiferromagnetic structure from one terrace to the next on cr(100 ) surface , by using the constant - current mode in the sp - stm . on the contrary , in the constant - distance mode , we directly detect a change of the exchange forces between the parallel and anti - parallel configurations at a given tip - sample separation . </S>",
    "<S> if such a measurement is performed by changing the tip - sample distance , we would face technical difficulties such as the snap - in effect : when the tip - sample distance comes in the point of force instability where the gradient of the force exceeds the magnitude of the lever stiffness , the tip and surface would snap into contact.@xcite in order to measure the rkky - type exchange force , we require an exploration of the way to avoid the snap - in effect . recently </S>",
    "<S> , a continuous measurement of the force curve between tip and sample , as approaching towards contact without the snap - in effects , can be provided by means of force - controlled feedback system.@xcite this technique may possibly provide the basis of the efm measurement . </S>"
