    "lorentzian wormholes were originally found as solutions of the einstein field equations with non - trivial topology . in their more simple examples",
    "they present two mouths in asymptotically flat spacetimes connected by a throat @xcite .",
    "more general and purely geometric definitions allow to remove the requirement for asymptotically flat regions and the introduction of trivial topologies in wormhole spacetimes , both static @xcite and dynamic @xcite .",
    "all these wormholes , nonetheless , must be threaded by matter that violates the null energy condition if they are going to be traversable by material systems @xcite .",
    "+ the requirements for exotic matter that violates the energy conditions can be reduced introducing scalar fields or electric charges . very recently",
    "kim and lee @xcite have presented exact solutions for a static charged wormhole .",
    "these spacetimes are free of horizons , so the charge , although having effects on the stability , does not seriously affect the spacetime itself .",
    "+ despite nothing is known about the equation of state of exotic matter , a stability analysis is possible through linearized perturbations around static solutions of the einstein field equations .",

    "we do not intend to provide any explanation on the mechanisms that might allow the wormhole to acquire or maintain its charge , but we rather focus on the consequences of the charge on the global stability of the system .",
    "we use geometrized units ( c = g=1 ) . the reissner - nordstrm metric is the unique spherically symmetric solution of the vacuum einstein - maxwell coupled equations . in schwarzschild coordinates @xmath0 it takes the form @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the mass and @xmath3 is the sum of the squares of the electric ( @xmath4 ) and magnetic ( @xmath5 ) charges , measured by distant observers . in a local orthonormal frame , the nonzero components of the electromagnetic field tensor are @xmath6 and @xmath7 . if @xmath8 , this geometry represents a black hole with an event horizon with radius @xmath9 if @xmath10 it is a naked singularity .",
