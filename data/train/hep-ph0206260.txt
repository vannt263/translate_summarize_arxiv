    "the experimental measurement of short - lived hadron resonances can potentially be very useful in clarifying some of the least understood aspects of heavy ion collisions . in general , evolution of a hot hadronic system proceeds according to fig .",
    "[ problem ] .",
    "when mesons and baryons emerge from a pre - hadronic state , presumably quark gluon plasma , their abundances are expected to be fixed by hadronization temperature and chemical fugacities .",
    "this stage of fireball evolution is commonly known as chemical freeze - out .",
    "after initial hadronization , the system may evolve as an interacting hadron gas . at a certain point ( which can vary according to particle species ) , thermal freeze - out , where hadrons stop interacting , is reached .",
    "a quantitative understanding of the above picture is crucial for any meaningful analysis of the final state particles .",
    "many probes of deconfinement are most sensitive when the dense hadron matter fireball breakup is sudden and re - interaction time short or non - existent .",
    "final state particles could , however also emerge remembering relatively little about their primordial source , having been subject to re - scattering in purely hadronic gas phase . in fact",
    ", theoretical arguments have been advanced in support of both a sudden reaction picture @xcite and a long re - interaction timescale @xcite .",
    "both pictures have been applied to phenomenological fits of hyperon abundances and distributions @xcite .",
    "+    , width=453 ]    -0.5 cm it is apparent that hyperon resonances can be crucial in resolving this ambiguity : + their initial abundance , compared to stable particles with the same quark composition , depends primarily to the temperature at hadron formation",
    ". however , the observed abundance will be potentially quite different , and will strongly depend on the lifetime of the interacting hadron gas phase .",
    "resonances can only be observed via invariant mass reconstruction , and their short lifetime means that they can decay within the interacting hadron gas ( fig . [ rsc_fig ] ) . in this case , the decay products can undergo re - scattering , and emerge from the fireball with no memory about the parent resonance .",
    "thus , the observable resonance abundance is sensitive to precisely those parameters needed to distinguish between the sudden and gradual freeze - out models .",
    "this paper offers a pedagogical description of what we know about resonance production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "we start with a review of presently available experimental data , and the open questions which arise .",
    "we then proceed to describe how to calculate the initial resonance abundance and the effect of re - scattering in terms of the hadronization temperature and the lifetime of the interacting hadron gas .",
    "we show how these two parameters can be extracted from the experimental observations .",
    "finally , we discuss possible answers to experimental challenges raised in the first section , and suggest ways by which these questions could be resolved by further measurements .",
    "this survey incorporates recently published experimental measurements @xcite and theoretical results @xcite .",
    "resonances are detected through invariant mass reconstruction of their decay products .",
    "the channels relevant for the here considered @xmath3 resonances are :    @xmath4    and the proposed @xmath5 measurement would be performed via the observation of the decay : @xmath6 at present , na49 reported a @xmath7 signal @xcite , while star published an average of @xmath0 and @xmath8 yields @xcite .",
    "both the star @xcite and the na49 @xcite experiments perform this reconstruction based on data collected in their large volume _ time projection chambers _ ( tpc ) detectors . charged particle momenta are obtained by a measurement of their trajectories in a uniform magnetic field , while particle identification is done evaluating the rate of energy loss @xmath9 in the tpc @xcite .",
    "a centrality trigger selects the 14% ( star ) and 5% ( na49 ) most central inelastic interactions .",
    "the decay daughter candidates are selected via their momenta and @xmath9 .",
    "the resonance signal is obtained by the invariant mass reconstruction of each pair combination and the subtraction of a mixed event background estimated by combining candidates from different events ( figure  [ pbpb ] ) .",

    "it is clear that , given a determination of the respective signals to a reasonable precision , a qualitative distinction between the high temperature chemical freeze - out scenario followed by a rescattering phase and the low temperature sudden hadronization scenario can be made .",

    "a low observed ratio can either mean a low freeze - out temperature or a lot of rescattering in a long re - interaction phase .",

    "[ projdiag ] is enough to measure both the hadronization temperature and to distinguish between the sudden freeze - out scenario and a long re - interaction phase .",
    "the plots in fig .",
    "[ projdiag ] can also be used as consistency checks for the model : for example , the near independence of @xmath16 on temperature means that the equal temperature lines in the @xmath16 vs @xmath17 diagram are nearly insensitive to the details of the rescattering model .",
    "moreover the mass differences and lifetimes of the @xmath15 , @xmath0 combine in such a way as to make the @xmath5/(all @xmath11 ) vs @xmath18(all k- ) diagram fold into a very narrow band .",
    "any serious shortcoming within our rescattering model would be revealed if the observed particle ratios stray from this band .",
    "the first experimental results on short - lived resonances have raised more questions than answers .",
    "the low @xmath1 multiplicity measured by na49 , together with its non - detection at star , can not be understood with a thermal model exclusively",
    ". a @xmath1 suppression factor of at least 2 is needed to reproduce the measured multiplicity . however",
    ", this suppression does not appear to result from simple scattering with in - medium particles , described by models such as urqmd .",
    "such suppression should manifest itself much more strongly in case of the @xmath19 , which has a much shorter lifetime . on the contrary",
    ", no comparable depletion has been found in the case of the @xmath19 either at sps or rhic energies . moreover , no broadening of the resonance width , which should accompany a strongly interacting medium , has been observed . if these results are incorporated in the diagrams of fig .",
    "[ projdiag ] , the apparent result is sudden freeze - out with an unphysically low ( @xmath20 mev ) temperature . in analysing these results",
    "it should be kept in mind that the @xmath1 is a very unusual particle : unlike most other hadronic resonances ( @xmath21 ecc . ) , its high spin is due not to valence quark spin configuration but to the fact that the @xmath1 s valence quarks are believed to be in an l=1 state .",
    "the greater space separation of l=1 wave - functions means that the @xmath1 is especially susceptible to in - medium modifications . as fig .",
    "[ quenched ] shows , a @xmath22 suppression of the @xmath1 signal at hadronization would mean the data is perfectly compatible with the sudden freeze - out model described in @xcite      * if hadrons form in a quark coalescence process , the @xmath1 would be suppressed for the same reason that l=1 ( p - shell ) electrons are never captured by nuclei @xcite : the coalescence probability is dependent on the wave - function overlap at the formed particle s location @xmath23 .",
    "the overlap of two particles goes down for higher l states , and is 0 for odd l=1,3 , ... states .",
    "however , this effect should also manifest itself in proton - proton collisions , which serve as basis of the aa - reaction yield .",
    "we can thus exclude this effect .",
    "* similarly , the larger spatial extent of the @xmath1 means it is more susceptible to in - medium screening of the strong potential .",
    "this mechanism invoked for charmonium suppression can also suppress states such as the @xmath1 . * in - medium effects can mix the @xmath1 @xmath24 with the @xmath15 + @xmath25 state .",
    "reactions such as @xmath26 can deplete the @xmath1 states without a significant effect on the ( much more abundant ) @xmath15 population @xcite .",
    "this is analogous to the phenomenon of quenching , well known in atomic resonances @xcite : resonance radiation from many gases is known to be suppressed by in - medium collisions , which prevent photon emission by converting the excitation energy of the resonance into kinetic energy .",
    "* spin - orbit interactions due to in - medium chromomagnetic fields can also mix the @xmath1 with the @xmath15 .",
    "* isospin conservation forbids the decay @xmath27 but not @xmath28 , which is forbidden in vacuum since @xmath29 . at a temperature high enough for ( partial ) chiral symmetry restoration to take place , this",
    "may no longer be true , and the @xmath28 decay would become possible . in the same way , partial restoration of chiral symmetry may be suppressing the @xmath30 decay channel . * finally , in a long re - interaction phase there is a possibility that the @xmath0 will be re - generated .",
    "processes such as @xmath31 will lead to an enhancement of observed @xmath0 .",
    "processes which regenerate the @xmath1 , such as @xmath32 are considerably less likely , due to the suppression of higher ( @xmath33 ) partial waves .    the last effect can be properly taken into account by a more elaborate rescattering model , which takes all of the microscopic reaction dynamics into account .",
    "the other mechanisms are rather complex and uncertain , though for the rhic system , potential screening , spin - orbit mixing and @xmath34 mass change can be explored in a @xmath35 lattice calculation .",
    "however , these effects also depend on the unusual characteristics of the @xmath1 resonance .",
    "it seems to us that all these consideration suggest that other resonances should be studied to constrain the fireball freeze - out properties .",
    "the non - suppression of the @xmath0 makes it likely that other hadron resonances can also be detectable .",
    "the diagrams shown in the previous section imply that the @xmath15 should be abundantly produced , and it has many characteristics which would make it a logical next step in the study of resonances produced in heavy ion collisions .",
    "other proposed targets of observation are the @xmath36 and even the @xmath37 .",
    "the sudden freeze - out scenario can be thoroughly tested by the detection of non - strange baryon resonances ( @xmath38 and @xmath39 ) .",
    "the larger widths of these particles , as well as the larger scattering cross - section in hadronic matter of their decay products , mean that the very detectability of these particles in terms of an invariant mass analysis would be strong evidence of a very fast hadronization process .",
