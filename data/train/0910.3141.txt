    "interest in a sequential fourth generation has waxed and waned over the years @xcite . shortly after the discovery of the third generation , a fourth generation was an obvious extension .",
    "however , interest in a fourth generation dropped substantially after measurement of the number of light neutrinos at the @xmath4 pole showed that only three light neutrinos could exist .",
    "the discovery of neutrino oscillations suggested the possibility of a mass scale beyond the standard model , and models with a fourth generation containing a sufficiently massive neutrino became acceptable . in the early part of this decade",
    ", it was thought @xcite that electroweak precision measurements ruled out a fourth generation , however it was subsequently pointed out @xcite that if the fourth generation masses are not degenerate , then these constraints can be evaded . more recently , kribs et al .",
    "@xcite showed that a mass splitting of @xmath5 gev between the fourth generation quarks results in s and t parameters which are within the one - sigma error ellipse .",
    "most analyses of the phenomenology of a sequential fourth generation have focused on the minimal standard model . in this paper",
    ", we consider the phenomenology of the fourth generation @xmath0 in popular extensions of the standard model . in section",
    "ii , we discuss the randall - sundrum model and show that one expects a relatively large branching ratio for the flavor - changing decay @xmath6 , which could be detected at the lhc . in section iii , we study the two - higgs doublet models ( models i , ii and iii ) , and show that in model iii , the decay @xmath7 , where @xmath3 is either a higgs scalar or pseudoscalar , can have a huge branching ratio ( as high as 95% ) and we discuss the rather dramatic phenomenology at the lhc",
    ". finally , in section iv , we present our conclusions .",
    "the randall - sundrum model ( rs1 ) @xcite is a popular solution to the hierarchy problem , where the warped geometry of an additional dimension is responsible for generating tev scale physics from a more fundamental planck scale . in the original rs1 model , the standard model ( sm ) fields",
    "were confined to the tev brane , but it was quickly noted that they could be placed in the bulk without problems @xcite .",
    "this led to a natural resolution of the flavor hierarchy problem .",
    "in the basis of diagonal bulk masses , the normalized wavefunction of zero - mode fermions is given by @xcite @xmath8^{1/2},\\ ] ] where @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the 5-d mass parameter describing the location of the fermion in the bulk .",
    "for @xmath12 the fermion @xmath13 lives near the tev ( planck ) brane since its resulting yukawa coupling with the higgs field becomes large ( small ) . since the kaluza - klein ( kk ) modes lie near the tev brane , the heavier fermions have larger couplings to kk bosons . as noted by agashe et al .",
    "@xcite , there is mixing between the @xmath4-boson and the kk-@xmath4 boson , resulting in a shift of the fermionic couplings to the @xmath4 .    in this model ,",
    "the portion of the lagrangian responsible for sm flavor violation is given by @xcite @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "the vector and axial vector coefficients depend on the fermion @xmath13 and are given by @xmath17 , and @xmath18 .",
    "the constants @xmath19 are given in terms of equation [ fermion wavefunction ] by @xmath20 .",
    "lastly , @xmath21 is the zero - mode of the 4-d fermion field in the basis of diagonal 5-d bulk masses",
    ". however , this basis is not the same as the basis in which the 4-d mass terms are diagonal .",
    "this gives rise to flavor violating terms in the 4-d basis , which have larger couplings for heavier fermions .    using this formalism , agashe et al .",
    "@xcite point out that with three generations , the branching ratio for @xmath22 is of @xmath23 for a kk - z mass of 3 tev .",
    "this is a significant increase from the sm value . in the case of a fourth generation",
    "however , there are no electroweak precision constraints and so very large flavor changing neutral currents ( fcnc ) are allowed .",
    "in particular , one expects to observe @xmath24 at a large rate . due to the fact that the @xmath25 and the @xmath26 have nearly degenerate masses ,",
    "the decay of the @xmath25 is dominated by @xmath27 unless the mixing angle is very small .",
    "thus the decay rate for @xmath28 is proportional to @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is the mixing matrix that arises when expanding out the 4-d fermion fields from equation [ flavor violating lagrangian ] in the basis of diagonal 4-d mass terms .",
    "thus the @xmath31 factor in @xmath32 conveniently cancels the @xmath33 factor in @xmath34 when calculating the branching ratio br(@xmath24 ) .    the decay rate and branching ratio for @xmath24 depend on the four 5-d mass parameters for the left and right handed @xmath35 and @xmath25 .",
    "two of these can be eliminated in favor of the @xmath35 and @xmath25 masses . using the central value of @xmath36 given by agashe @xcite , the number of free parameters is reduced to the @xmath25 mass and the fermion mass parameter @xmath37 , which describes the location of the @xmath25 in the bulk .",
    "the results for the branching ratio are given in figure 1 for @xmath25 masses of @xmath38 and @xmath39 gev .",
    "as one varies the third generation mass parameter @xmath36 parameter ( discussed in the previous paragraph ) over a reasonable range , this result changes by less than a factor of two .",
    "we find a branching ratio of @xmath40 .",
    "atlas @xcite has claimed that a bound of @xmath41 can be reached in @xmath42 for @xmath22 . since the @xmath4 energy in the @xmath43 decay is similar to that in @xmath44 , one can get a rough estimate of the sensitivity by simply scaling this by the production cross section .",
    "this gives a sensitivity of @xmath45 for @xmath24 .",
    "one can probably do substantially better if one includes the fact that the @xmath35 in the decay can be detected , which will help eliminate backgrounds .",
    "it is clear that this places the decay within reach of the lhc , although a more precise analysis would be welcome .    branching ratio for @xmath24 as a function of the fermion mass parameter @xmath37 . ]",
    "how does this branching ratio compare with other models ?",
    "the most comprehensive study concerning fcnc in the four generation standard model is the work of arhrib and hou @xcite .",
    "they considered loop induced fcnc decays of fourth generation quarks , plus effects of fourth generation quarks on fcnc decays of third generation quarks .",
    "they found that the decay @xmath46 can occur in the standard model with a branching ratio of @xmath47 and suggest that this may be measurable at the lhc . in the randall - sundrum case",
    ", the branching ratio will be larger by approximately a factor of 100 .",
    "what about flavor models ? we know of no such models for four generations .",
    "one of us ( ms ) is studying such a model , but the rate will be similar to that of arhrib and hou ( additionally , flavor models do not typically give large rates for @xmath44 ) .",
    "it is also likely that other models will have a rate for @xmath48 or @xmath49 which is comparable to @xmath43 , unlike the randall - sundrum case .",
    "among the most popular extensions of the standard model are two higgs doublet models @xcite .",
    "the most common is called model ii . in the two higgs doublet model ii , due to a discrete symmetry , the down - type quarks and leptons couple to one complex doublet @xmath50 while the up - type quarks and neutrinos couple to the other @xmath51 .",
    "the ratio of vacuum expectation values ( vev ) is a free parameter defined by @xmath52 . by requiring that the theory be perturbative we obtain a bound on the possible values of @xmath53 .",
    "the yukawa couplings of fourth generation quarks are given by @xmath54 and @xmath55 , where @xmath56 .",
    "if we approximate @xmath57 gev and relate @xmath58 and @xmath59 to the standard model higgs vev @xmath60 in terms of @xmath53 , then the theory will remain perturbative , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , only if @xmath63 thus for model ii with @xmath64 gev we find @xmath65 . in model",
    "i the @xmath50 field does not couple to fermions , which eliminates the upper bound , the lower bound however remains unchanged .",
    "issues of perturbation theory and vacuum stability pose a challenge to four - generation models .",
    "as noted most recently by kribs @xcite , in the standard model the large yukawa couplings will cause the scalar self - coupling to either go negative ( leading to vacuum instability ) or reach a landau pole well before the gut scale .",
    "the yukawa coupling itself can also reach a landau pole at relatively low scales .",
    "although methods can be found to extend the reach of perturbation theory @xcite , they do involve addition of new physics just above the tev scale .",
    "in the two higgs doublet models , the situation is much more complicated since there are many scalar self - couplings , many other vacua ( such as charge - breaking vacua ) and many other opportunities for instabilities .",
    "our approach here is to assume that the two higgs doublet model is an effective theory below the tev scale , and will presume that physics above that scale will not substantially affect our results .",
    "since the charged higgs @xmath66 is a possible decay product of the @xmath25 through the decay @xmath67 , and this decay will be very difficult to observe , there will be a slight suppression in the branching ratio br(@xmath28 ) , which is shown in figure 2 as a function of the charged higgs mass .    branching ratio for @xmath68 as a function of the ratio @xmath69 . ]",
    "a much more interesting situation arises in model iii . in model iii",
    ", there is no discrete symmetry prohibiting tree level flavor changing neutral currents .",
    "initially this appears to be very problematic .",
    "however if one goes to a basis in which one of the scalar fields gets a vacuum expectation value and the other does not , then the couplings of the latter , @xmath3 , will be , in general , flavor changing . by analyzing various mass matrix textures , cheng and",
    "sher @xcite argued that fine - tuning can be avoided if the flavor changing neutral couplings @xmath70 are given by @xmath71 and the couplings @xmath72 are of @xmath73 .",
    "in other words , the flavor changing yukawa couplings are the geometric mean of the two yukawa couplings of the fermions involved .",
    "model iii is defined as the two higgs doublet model with yukawa couplings given by the above expression .",
    "recent studies @xcite of heavy quark mixing and decays have begun exploring interesting regions of parameters space ( which depends on the @xmath72 and the relevant higgs masses ) .",
    "note that in this model , the flavor changing couplings of the light quarks are very small , and the constraints from kaon physics are not as severe .",
    "only a few studies of model iii have been done @xcite involving fourth generation fields .    in this model",
    ", one would expect an enormous flavor changing coupling between the @xmath25 , the @xmath35 and the @xmath3 .",
    "the coupling , in fact , would be substantially larger than the top quark yukawa coupling .",
    "if kinematically accessible , then one would expect @xmath74 to overwhelmingly dominant @xmath25 decays . here",
    ", @xmath3 can be the combination of neutral scalars that is orthogonal to the state that gets a vev , or it can be the pseudoscalar . in either event , this decay will dominate .",
    "the cross section for producing a 400 gev @xmath25 is 15 picobarns @xcite .",
    "virtually all of these @xmath25s will decay into @xmath75 , leading to a dramatic @xmath76 signature .",
    "if @xmath3 is a pseudoscalar or a neutral scalar lighter than about 140 gev , then it will decay into @xmath77 , leading to a @xmath78 final state .",
    "the biggest standard model background to these events would come from double pair production of @xmath79 .",
    "the cross section for this background @xcite is approximately 2 picobarns , and it gives a @xmath80 final state . if one only looks at events with three or more tagged @xmath81 s and one or more leptons , and assumes a @xmath81-tag efficiency of 40% , then the signal will pass the cut @xmath82 of the time , and the background will pass the cut @xmath83 of the time , leading to a signal of 3150 fb and a background of only 160 fb .",
    "thus , it appears that the signal will easily be detectable , possibly in an early run at the lhc .",
    "if @xmath3 is a neutral scalar heavier than 140 gev , then it will decay into @xmath84 leading to a @xmath85 final state . here , if one looks at events with three or more leptons and one or more tagged @xmath81 s , then @xmath86 of the decays will pass the cuts , leading to an event rate of 1.8 picobarns .",
    "we know of no standard model background that comes close to this signal .",
    "this signal would also be easily detectable at the lhc .",
    "there continues to be interest in the phenomenology of a sequential fourth generation .",
    "yet almost all discussion have been in the context of the standard model . in this paper",
    ", we have explored the phenomenology of the fourth generation , focusing on the @xmath25 quark , in extensions of the standard model . in the randall - sundrum model ,",
    "the decay @xmath43 can occur at a rate approaching one percent , which should be detectable at the lhc . in two - higgs doublet model ,",
    "one gets a suppression of the branching ratio @xmath27 in models i and ii , but in model iii the decay of @xmath74 , where @xmath3 is a scalar or pseudoscalar , dominates the decay , leading to spectacular @xmath76 signatures at very large rates , which could be detected during the early months of running at the lhc .",
