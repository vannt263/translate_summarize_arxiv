    "the few - nucleon sector of baryon chiral perturbation theory was first considered in the seminal papers by weinberg @xcite which triggered an intensive research activity starting with the pioneering work of ref .  @xcite . in this approach for processes involving @xmath0 nucleons the power counting is applied to the effective potential , which is defined as the sum of all @xmath1-nucleon - irreducible diagrams .",
    "the scattering amplitudes are obtained by solving the lippmann - schwinger ( ls ) or schrdinger equation . for recent reviews and references",
    "see e.g. refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the implementation of weinberg s program encountered problems .",
    "the nn potential of the effective field theory ( eft ) is non - renormalizable in the traditional sense already at leading order .",
    "the iteration of the potential in the ls equation generates divergent terms with structures which are not included in the original potential .",
    "therefore , the renormalization of the solution to the ls equation requires the contributions of an infinite number of higher - order counter - terms . here , the infinite number refers to both the loop and the chiral expansions .",
    "the freedom of choosing the finite parts of these counter - terms is compensated by the running of the corresponding renormalized couplings .",
    "it has been argued that the coefficients of the divergent parts of the counter - terms contributing in low - order calculations would set the scale of the corresponding renormalized couplings . as a consequence ,",
    "even if these couplings were natural at some value of the renormalization scale , they would become unnaturally large for slightly different values of this parameter .",
    "this problem ( also analyzed non - perturbatively ) , in different variations , has been addressed as the inconsistency of weinberg s approach , and an alternative power counting scheme , known as the ksw approach , has been suggested @xcite . in the ksw scheme",
    "the troublesome one - pion - exchange ( ope ) potential is shifted from leading order ( lo ) to next - to - leading order ( nlo ) .",
    "the leading - order equation becomes renormalizable , i.e. all divergences can be absorbed in the redefinition of the parameters of the lo potential , perturbatively as well as non - perturbatively .",
    "moreover , the lo equation is exactly solvable and dimensional regularization can be applied .",
    "corrections are treated perturbatively in the ksw approach .",
    "this guarantees that _ all _ divergences are absorbed in parameters contributing to the given order . as a consequence ,",
    "the ksw approach is free of  consistency problems .",
    " unfortunately this scheme suffers from convergence problems .",
    "as the ope potential is shifted to nlo , it is treated perturbatively .",
    "it has been argued that the perturbative treatment of pions in nn scattering poses problems of convergence @xcite .",
    "the results of ref .",
    "@xcite made it explicit that perturbative series do not converge in the ksw approach , at least in the triplet channel .",
    "as a next step , in ref .",
    "@xcite a non - perturbative investigation of the renormalization problem has been carried out and an expansion of nuclear forces about the chiral limit has been suggested .",
    "it has been argued that this expansion is formally consistent and is equivalent to the ksw power counting in the @xmath2 channel and to weinberg s power counting in the @xmath3 coupled channels .",
    "higher partial waves have been investigated in ref .",
    "@xcite with the result that the perturbative treatment of the ope potential is not sufficient for a finite number of partial waves , e.g. @xmath4 and @xmath5 . on the other hand ,",
    "the iterated ope potential produces a cutoff dependence in all waves where the tensor force is attractive .",
    "this requires additional counter - terms in each of these partial waves , clearly upsetting the power counting .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite conjecture that the `` mixture of perturbative treatment of higher partial waves , resummation of lower partial waves , and promotion of a finite number of counter - terms is the most consistent approach '' to the chiral perturbation theory for nuclear systems while sub - leading interactions are treated perturbatively .",
    "there exists an alternative point of view that the  consistency problem  of weinberg s approach is irrelevant and one can perform the calculations in cutoff effective field theory ( eft ) by suitably choosing the cutoff parameter .",
    "according to this point of view , taking large values of the cutoff parameter without including the contributions of all ( perturbatively ) relevant counter - terms is not a legitimate procedure .",
    "instead one has to choose the cutoff parameter of the order of the relevant large scale , presumably the mass of the @xmath6 meson @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we develop a new approach which combines aspects of both points of view outlined above .",
    "in particular , in our new framework the leading - order amplitude is calculated by solving integral equations and corrections are taken into account perturbatively .",
    "analogously to the ksw approach , the ( leading ) renormalization scale dependence to any given finite order is absorbed in the redefinition of a finite number of parameters of the effective potential at the given order .",
    "on the other hand , analogously to weinberg s scheme , the ope potential is of leading order and is treated non - perturbatively .    in the two - nucleon sector",
    "the path integral for the generating functional of the green s functions is not gaussian and therefore the standard heavy - baryon reduction can not be carried out . while the non - relativistic effective lagrangian can be fixed by matching to the ( explicitly ) lorentz - invariant lagrangian , we prefer to work in terms of the latter .",
    "we start with the higher - derivative formulation of the manifestly lorentz - invariant lagrangian of ref .",

    "one encounters ultraviolet divergences in the equations for the few - nucleon scattering amplitudes .",
    "this problem can be handled by considering a nucleon propagator with improved ultraviolet behavior @xcite . to that end",

    "we consider a new approach to the nucleon - nucleon scattering problem in baryon chiral perturbation theory . starting with a lorentz - invariant form of the effective lagrangian with higher derivative terms we work out a new framework where the nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitude is calculated order - by - order in small parameters like the pion mass and nucleon three - momenta . we develop a systematic power counting for the effective potential which is defined as the sum of all two - nucleon irreducible diagrams .",

    "higher - order corrections to the potential as well as to the two - nucleon propagator are taken into account perturbatively .",
    "the parameter @xmath48 , introduced through terms with higher derivatives , parameterizes the renormalization scheme dependence of the scattering amplitude present in our calculations .",
    "due to the uv behavior of our semi - relativistic two - nucleon propagator , analogously to the ksw approach , the strong @xmath48-dependence of physical quantities to any finite order is absorbed in the redefinition of a finite number of parameters of the effective potential at given order .",
    "on the other hand , analogously to weinberg s power counting , the ope potential is of leading order and is treated non - perturbatively .",
    "our new approach preserves all underlying symmetries to the given order of accuracy and the self - consistency of the power counting is explicit in this new formulation .",
