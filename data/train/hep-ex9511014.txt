    "in this paper , we present a new measurement of the inclusive semi - electronic branching fraction of the @xmath4 meson .",
    "the comparison of the measured inclusive semi - leptonic branching fraction with the sum of the observed exclusive semi - leptonic branching fraction provides a measure of _ missing _ or unobserved modes .",
    "recent experimental progress on exclusive measurements has yielded precise measurements of the dominant cabibbo favored modes , observation and measurement of the cabibbo suppressed branching fractions and stringent upper limits on suppressed cabibbo favored branching fractions , but has not yielded an improvement in the measured inclusive semi - leptonic branching fraction .",
    "the inclusive branching fraction measurement presented here and previous measurements of exclusive branching fractions allows for more accurate comparison than previously performed . for a complete review of experimental and theoretical developments",
    "we refer the reader to recent reviews  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we combine the inclusive result presented here with previous cleo results on @xmath11 and @xmath12  @xcite to obtain the ratio , @xmath13 . as a check of the method the observed inclusive electron momentum spectrum",
    "is also extracted from the data and compared with a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the technique to measure the absolute inclusive semi - electronic branching fraction of @xmath4 mesons is similar to the previous cleo absolute branching fraction measurement of @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "common to both analyses is the method used to determine the number of @xmath1 decays in the data with minimal systematic bias .",
    "it is based on the unique two body kinematics of the @xmath1 decay and the topology of @xmath15 reactions at a center of mass energy of @xmath16 gev .",
    "briefly , the idea is that the thrust axis ( defined to be that axis along which the projected momentum is a maximum ) for the event approximates the @xmath17 direction in the lab . the limited amount of available phase space in the @xmath18 decay , results in a small angle between the thrust axis and the charged pion .",
    "we denote this angle between the thrust axis and the charged pion as @xmath19 .",
    "also , the magnitude of the pion momentum is correlated to the parent @xmath17 momentum .",
    "pions with momentum greater than 225 mev / c are kinematically forbidden to come from the @xmath20 , @xmath21 , @xmath1 decay chain .",
    "this selection assures that the @xmath17 is from @xmath22 production and the event has a well defined thrust axis .",
    "the top plot in figure  [ figure : sinalpha_summed ] shows the @xmath23 distribution for all pions with momentum between 225 and 425 mev / c in the data .",
    "the peaking at low @xmath23 is evidence for @xmath1 decays .",
    "the total number , @xmath24 , of decays in the sample is @xmath25 .",
    "this total is identical to that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , as the same data and selection criteria are used in both analyses .",
    "the total number of semi - electronic decays , @xmath26 , @xmath27 , is determined by identifying an @xmath2 within a cone around the @xmath0 direction and plotting the @xmath23 distribution for those @xmath0 with an associated @xmath2 .",
    "this is achieved by studying the sign correlated @xmath28 combinations in the data .",
    "`` right sign '' combinations , @xmath29 , provide the signal distribution and `` wrong sign '' combinations , @xmath30 , are studied to aid background determinations .",
    "once the number of @xmath31 decays has been determined , the branching fraction is then , @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the efficiency for detecting the electron .",
    "a detailed description of the cleo ii detector can be found in ref .",
    "electrons and positrons  @xcite are identified principally from the ratio of the energy measured by the csi calorimeter and the momentum measured by the drift chamber ( e / p ) .",
    "additional information on energy loss in the drift chamber and shower shape in the calorimeter is also used to maximize the identification efficiency and minimize the mis - identification of hadronic tracks .",
    "the electrons are required to have momentum greater than 0.7 gev / c and a polar angle with respect to the beam axis ( @xmath34 ) between 45@xmath35 and 135@xmath35 , to insure a well determined efficiency and minimal uncertainty due to mis - identified hadronic tracks .",
    "furthermore it is important to reduce the number of electrons from @xmath36 ; @xmath37 , where the @xmath38 final state is due to either a dalitz decay of the @xmath39 or a @xmath40 conversion in the detector material .",
    "this is accomplished by requiring that the identified electron , when combined with each opposite sign track in the event , does not yield an electron - positron mass below 0.050 gev / c@xmath41 .",
    "every opposite sign track is used to form these pairs , whether or not it is identified as an electron .    in order to correlate the @xmath0 with an @xmath2",
    "a fiducial angle cut is applied in the lab frame .",
    "we require that @xmath42 , where @xmath43 is the angle between the @xmath44 emitted in the initial @xmath1 decay and the electron from the subsequent @xmath3 decay .",
    "the bottom histogram in figure  [ figure : sinalpha_summed ] shows the @xmath23 distributions for @xmath44 s after requiring an electron within this angular region ; the solid squares are for @xmath45 combinations ( right sign ) and the open squares are for @xmath30 combinations(wrong sign ) .",
    "as previously stated , the yield of @xmath1 decays is identical to that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite . in this section",
    "we detail the determination of the number of @xmath3 decays associated with the initial @xmath1 decay .",
    "the @xmath23 distribution for @xmath45 ( right sign ) combinations contains three distinct components : signal and two types of background .",
    "one background has a @xmath23 distribution that is identical to the signal as it originates from the decay @xmath1 , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 denotes a @xmath2 from either a hadronic track mis - identified as a electron or an electron from a @xmath37 final state .",
    "the other background is due to random soft pions ( 225 to 425 mev / c in momentum ) , in coincidence with an electron , and is not as sharply peaked near @xmath48 as the signal distribution .",
    "the @xmath23 distribution for @xmath30 ( wrong sign ) combinations is devoid of signal but contains the same two sources of background as the right sign distribution  @xcite .",
    "the shapes for these backgrounds in the right sign and wrong sign distributions are identical , although the normalizations differ .",
    "this difference in normalization is the result of the hadronic track mixture ( @xmath49 ratio ) combined with the hadronic track mis - identification rates . for the non-@xmath17 pion background ,",
    "the normalization is different due to charge conservation in the event .",
    "the expected @xmath23 distributions , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , for the right sign and wrong sign distributions are obtained from a monte carlo simulation .",
    "the monte carlo simulation correctly reproduces the measured @xmath17 production momentum distribution , and simulates @xmath3 decays via the `` cocktail '' of exclusive modes presented in appendix a. the second order polynomial , @xmath54 , is constrained to have the same shape for both the wrong and right sign distributions .",
    "the yield of @xmath3 decays , @xmath55 , the yield of mis - identified hadrons and electrons from @xmath56 in the wrong sign distribution , @xmath57 , the normalizations and shape , @xmath58 , @xmath59 and @xmath54 , of the background polynomial are determined from the fits to the @xmath23 distribution of the right sign and wrong sign samples in bins of pion momentum , @xmath60 .",
    "the @xmath23 distributions for the data , with the resulting fits overlaid , are shown in figures  [ figure : data1 ] and  [ figure : data2 ] and the right sign and wrong sign yields are presented in table  [ table : yields ] .",
    "the right sign yields reported in this table have a contribution due to @xmath61 backgrounds .       [",
