    "since the experimental discovery of an unusual half - integer quantum hall effect ( qhe )  @xcite in monolayer graphene , the electronic transport properties of graphene related materials have been extensively studied  @xcite .",
    "recently , bilayer graphene is found to show an anomalous behavior in its spectral and transport properties , which has attracted much experimental and theoretical interest .",
    "theoretical studies  @xcite show that interlayer coupling modifies the intralayer relativistic spectrum to yield a quasiparticle spectrum with a parabolic energy dispersion , which implies that the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene can not be treated as massless but have a finite mass .",
    "experiments have shown that bilayer graphene exhibits an unconventional integer qhe  @xcite . the landau level ( ll ) quantization results in plateaus of hall conductivity at integer positions proportional to the valley degeneracy , but the plateau at zero energy is markedly absent .",
    "the unconventional qhe behavior derives from the coupling between the two graphene layers .",
    "the quasiparticles in bilayer graphene are chiral and carry a berry phase 2@xmath1 , which strongly affects their quantum dynamics . however , a detailed theoretical understanding of the unconventional properties of the qhe in bilayer graphene taking into account of the full band structure and disorder effect is still lacking . as established for a single layer graphene  @xcite and conventional quantum hall systems  @xcite , the qhe phase diagram in such a system is crucially depending on the topological properties of the full energy band , and thus can be naturally determined in the band model calculations .    in this work ,",
    "we carry out a numerical study of the qhe in bilayer graphene in the presence of disorder based upon a tight - binding model .",
    "we reveal that the experimentally observed unconventional qhe plateaus emerge near the band center , while the conventional qhe plateaus appear near the band edges .",
    "the unconventional ones are found to be much more stable to disorder scattering than the conventional ones near the band edges .",
    "we further investigate the quantum phase transition and obtain the phase boundaries @xmath2 for different qhe states to insulator transition by calculating the thouless number  @xcite .",
    "our results show that the unconventional qhe plateaus can be destroyed at strong disorder ( or weak magnetic field ) through the float - up of extended levels toward the band center and higher plateaus always disappear first . while the @xmath3 qhe states are most stable , the dirac point at the band center separating these two qhe states remains critical with a nearly constant longitudinal conductance .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "we will call central ll at @xmath51 the @xmath52 ll , the one just above ( below ) it the @xmath53 ( @xmath54 ) ll , and so on . according to the behavior of @xmath41 , the energy band",
    "is naturally divided into three different regimes . around the band center ,",
    "the hall conductivity is quantized as @xmath55 , where @xmath56 with @xmath57 an integer and @xmath58 for each ll due to double - valley degeneracy  @xcite ( the spin degeneracy will contribute an additional factor @xmath59 , which is omitted here ) . with each additional ll",
    "being occupied , the total hall conductivity is increased by @xmath60 .",

    "these anomalously quantized hall plateaus agree with the results observed experimentally in bilayer graphene  @xcite .",
    "the hall conductivity near the band edges , however , is quantized as @xmath66 with @xmath57 an integer , as in the conventional qhe systems .",
    "remarkably , around @xmath67 ( within a narrow energy region @xmath68 ) , there are two critical regions which separate the unconventional and conventional qhe states , where the hall conductance quantization is lost .",
    "these crossover regions also correspond to a novel transport regime , where the hall resistance changes sign and the longitudinal conductivity exhibits metallic behavior .",
    "the singular behavior of the hall conductivity in the crossover regions is likely to originate from the van hove singularity in the electron density of states at @xmath69 limit . in fig .  2b , the quantization rule of the hall conductivity in this unconventional region for three different strengths of magnetic flux is shown .",
    "with decreasing magnetic flux from @xmath70 to @xmath71 , more quantized hall plateaus emerge following the same quantization rule as the gap between the lls is reduced .     or m=48 , and ( b ) the hall conductivity near the band center for @xmath72 , @xmath73 and @xmath71 .",

    "@xmath75 and the sample size is @xmath49.,width=288 ]    now we study the effect of random disorder on the unconventional qhe in bilayer graphene . in fig .  3 ,",
    "the hall conductivity around the band center is shown as a function of @xmath47 for four different disorder strengths at system size @xmath49 with magnetic flux @xmath76 .",
    "we can see that the plateaus with @xmath77 and @xmath78 remain well quantized at @xmath79 .",
    "we mention that the @xmath80 plateaus are unclear at this relatively weak disorder strength because of very small plateau widths and relatively large localization lengths ( the critical @xmath81 for each plateau will be obtained based on our larger size calculations of the thouless number as presented later ) . with increasing @xmath82 , higher hall plateaus ( with larger @xmath83 )",
    "are destroyed first . at @xmath84 ,",
    "only the @xmath3 qhe remain robust .",
    "the last two plateaus @xmath3 eventually disappear around @xmath85 . for comparison",
    ", the qhe near the lower band edge is shown in the inset , where all plateaus disappear at a much weaker disorder strength @xmath86 .",
    "this clearly indicates that under the same conditions , the unconventional qhe around the band center is much more stable than the conventional qhe near the band edges .",
    "clearly , after the destruction of the conventional qhe states near the band edge , these states become localized .",
    "then the topological chern numbers initially carried by these states will move towards band center in a similar manner to the single - layer graphene case  @xcite .",
    "thus we observe that the destruction of the unconventional qhe states near the band center is due to the float - up of extended levels .    ,",

    "4a , a lot more well quantized hall plateaus emerge for a clean sample(@xmath48 ) , if we compare them with the results in fig .",
    "2b . in fig .  4b , 4c and 4d , we can see that with the increasing of the disorder strength @xmath82 , hall plateaus are destroyed faster for the system with weaker magnetic flux @xmath92 . at @xmath84 , the most robust hall plateaus at @xmath3",
    "remain well quantized for magnetic flux @xmath90 and @xmath87 , however , they already disappear for weaker magnetic flux @xmath93 .",
    "our flux @xmath94 in each hexagon the magnetic field is @xmath95 tesla@xcite .",
    "thus the weakest @xmath7 we used is about @xmath96 tesla .",
    "this is a very large magnetic field comparing to the experimental ones around @xmath97 tesla .",
    "however , the topology of the qhe and how they disappear with the increase of the disorder strength @xmath82 remain to be the same as the stronger @xmath7 cases as demonstrated in fig .",
    "thus , we establish that the obtained behavior of qhe for bilayer graphene will survive at weak @xmath7 limit .",
    "we further investigate the quantum phase transition of the bilayer graphene electron system . in order to determine the critical disorder strength @xmath2 for the different qhe states ,",
    "the thouless number @xmath98 is calculated by using the following formula  @xcite , @xmath99 here , @xmath100 is the geometric mean of the shift in the energy levels of the system caused by replacing periodic by antiperiodic boundary conditions , and @xmath101 is the mean spacing of the energy levels .",
    "the thouless number @xmath98 is proportional to the longitudinal conductance @xmath102 . in fig .  5 , we show some examples of calculated thouless number for a relatively weak flux @xmath76 and some different disorder strengths to explain how quantum phase transitions and the related phase boundaries @xmath81 are determined . in fig .  5a ,",
    "the calculated thouless number @xmath98 and hall conductivity @xmath41 as a function of @xmath47 at a weak disorder strength @xmath103 are plotted .",
    "clearly , each valley in thouless number corresponds to a hall plateau and each peak corresponds to a critical point between two neighboring hall plateaus .",
    "we can also call the first valley just above ( below ) @xmath51 the @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) qhe state , the second one the @xmath106 ( @xmath107 ) state , and so on , as same as the hall plateaus . in fig .",
    "5b-5d , we see that with increasing @xmath82 , higher qhe states ( valleys ) are destroyed first . at @xmath108",
    "( see fig .",
    "5b ) , the valleys with @xmath109 disappear , which correspond to the destruction of the @xmath110 hall plateau states .",
    "therefore , @xmath111 is the critical disorder strength , at which the @xmath112 plateau states change to an insulating phase . at @xmath113 ( see fig .",
    "5c ) , the valleys with @xmath114 disappear , which indicates the destruction of the @xmath114 qhe states and their transition into the insulating phase .",
    "when @xmath115 ( see fig.5d ) , the most stable qhe states with @xmath116 eventually disappear , which indicates all qhe phases are destroyed by disorder .",
    "all the phase boundaries @xmath2 between the different qhe states are determined in the same manner and tabulated in table 1 .",
    "disorder configurations . here ,",
    "@xmath75 and the sample size are taken to be @xmath117 and @xmath49 in the calculations of thouless number and hall conductivity , respectively.,width=316 ]    we now focus on the region around @xmath64 . in fig .",
    "6 , we show the thouless number for some different disorder strengths at system size @xmath49 and magnetic flux @xmath76 .",
    "we can see that the thouless number shows a central peak at @xmath64 .",
    "with increasing the disorder strength , the width of the peak increases and its height remains nearly unchanged .",
    "this behavior may suggest an interesting effect that the extended states originally sited at the critical point @xmath51 splits in the presence of disorder . however , the splitting is too small to induce two separated peaks in the thouless number for the present sample sizes we can approach .",
    "instead , it leads to a widened peak of unreduced height .",
    "this behavior also indicates that the critical longitudinal conductance in a small finite region near @xmath51 is almost constant about @xmath118 according to the proportionality of thouless number to longitudinal conductance .",
    "we have also confirmed this conclusion by direct kubo formula calculation , in which the system size that can be approached is however much smaller .",

    "in summary , we have numerically investigated the qhe in bilayer graphene based on tight - binding model in the presence of disorder .",
    "the experimentally observed unconventional qhe is reproduced near the band center . the unconventional qhe plateaus around the band center",
    "are found to be much more stable than the conventional ones near the band edges .",
    "our results of quantum phase transition indicate that with increasing disorder strength , the hall plateaus can be destroyed through the float - up of extended levels toward the band center and higher plateaus always disappear first . at @xmath115 ,",
    "the most stable qhe states with @xmath116 eventually disappear , which indicates transition of all qhe phases into the insulating phase .",
    "a small critical region is observed between the @xmath116 plateaus , where the longitudinal conductance remains almost constant about @xmath118 in the presence of moderate disorder , possibly due to the splitting of the critical point originally sited at @xmath51 .",
    "we mention that in our numerical calculations , the magnetic field is much stronger than the ones one can realize in the experimental situation , as limited by current computational ability .",
    "however , the phase diagram we obtained is robust and applicable to weak field limit since it is determined by the topological property of the energy band as clearly established for single layer graphene  @xcite and conventional quantum hall systems  @xcite .",
    "we further point out that the continuum model can not be used to address the fate of the quantum hall effect in strong disorder or weak magnetic field limit .",
    "because in such a model , both the band bottom and band edge are pushed to infinite energy limit , and thus one will not be able to see the important physics of opposite chern numbers annihilating each other to destroy the iqhe@xcite .",
