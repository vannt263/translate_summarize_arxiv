    "the study of pedestrian flow in a crowd environment is attracting an increasing interest and some models based on optimization principles have been recently proposed , see for example @xcite . in some applications ( crowd motion in shopping centers , stations , airports ) the dynamics of the population",
    "is defined on a network rather than in an euclidean domain .",
    "+ there is a large literature concerning vehicular traffic on road networks ( see @xcite and reference therein ) .",
    "these models are based on a fluido - dynamical approach with the dynamics described by some nonlinear conservation law and appropriate transition conditions at the junctions modelling the interactions of the cars coming from different roads .",
    "vehicular traffic models do not seem to be adequate to reproduce the pedestrian flow since they do not take into account the interactions and the goal - directed decisions of the agents .",
    "+ aim of this paper is to study a simple optimization model for the evolution of a large number of agents moving on a network .",
    "the model is based on the one described in @xcite , titled `` what time does meeting start ? '' , and consists in finding the optimal arrival time at a place where the meeting is being held with the starting time defined by means of a quorum rule .",
    "this problem can be considered as a prototype for a large class of optimization problems based on the mean field game ( mfg ) theory .",
    "this theory has been introduced by lasry and lions @xcite ( see also @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) with the aim of describing the behavior of very large number of agents who take decisions in a context of strategic interactions . + the main difficulties in our approach is to deal with the transition conditions at the internal vertices to obtain a well posed mfg problem .",
    "it is known that a parabolic equation on a network has to be complemented with the usual initial - boundary conditions and some transition conditions at the internal vertices ( see @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , in our model the stochastic differential equation describing the motion of the agent inside the arcs is coupled with a condition prescribing the probability that it enter in a given edge when it occupies a transition vertex ; this fact give rise to a kirchhoff type condition ( see @xcite ) .",
    "using an appropriate change of variable we transform the original mfg system in a forward - backward system of two heat equations coupled via the initial datum . relying on classical results for the heat equation on networks and some appropriate estimates for the specific problem",
    ", we prove the well - posedness of the heat system and the existence of a mean field for the quorum problem .",
    "going back to the original mfg problem we obtain existence and uniqueness of the solution to a system composed by a _",
    "backward _ hamilton - jacobi - bellman equation and a _ forward _ fokker - planck on the arcs with transitions conditions expressing respectively the probability that a single agent enters a given arc and the conservation of the density of the agents through a vertex .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ s2 ]",
    "we describe the model problem . in [ s3 ]",
