    "ferroelectric relaxors , in particular complex perovskites with the general formula @xmath8 and @xmath9 , are of high interest due to their excellent dielectric , electrostrictive , and pyroelectric properties@xcite .",
    "a discovery of giant piezoelectric response in relaxor based crystals by park and shrout@xcite turned attention of scientific community to better understanding the relaxor ferroelectricity .",
    "lead magnesium niobate @xmath10 ( pmn ) and lead scandium tantalate @xmath11 ( pst ) are model representatives of the relaxor ferroelectrics which exhibit high and broad maxima in the real @xmath12 and imaginary @xmath13 part of the dielectric permittivity which shift with the increasing frequency to higher temperatures .",
    "no ferroelectric ( fe ) phase transition occurs in pmn without bias electric field , while pst exhibits a  spontaneous fe transition .",
    "its temperature depends on the ordering of b - site ions ( sc and ta ) .",
    "disordered pst undergoes fe transition at @xmath14k , while @xmath15 of the ordered sample appears near 300@xmath1 without typical relaxor behavior above @xmath16@xcite .",
    "it is well known that the peculiar dielectric properties of relaxors are connected with a  broad dielectric relaxation ( we call it central mode ( cm ) in analogy with inelastic scattering experiments ) below the polar phonon frequencies .",
    "it stems from the dynamics of nanoscopic inhomogeneities - polar clusters .",
    "many low - frequency experimental dielectric data exist on the behavior of cm in fe relaxors , but much less data were published about dielectric response in the mhz and ghz range@xcite and thz data are practically missing in the literature .",
    "neutron diffuse scattering in pmn revealed@xcite the cm below the burns temperature , @xmath17k , where the polar nanoclusters appear .",
    "however , its frequency was not determined .    very recently",
    ", infrared ( ir ) transmission and microwave dielectric data@xcite of pmn have shown that the cm has characteristic frequency near 20@xmath2  ( 0.6thz ) at @xmath18 and its frequency dramatically slows down to sub - hertz region on cooling to freezing temperature @xmath19 near 200@xmath1@xcite .",
    "simultaneously the relaxation broadens on cooling , giving rise to frequency independent losses between 100@xmath20hz and 100@xmath20ghz at temperatures below @xmath21@xcite .",
    "dielectric studies of pst up to 33@xmath20ghz revealed a  two - component cm,@xcite however its behavior at high temperatures near @xmath18 was not studied .",
    "one of the aims of this study is to investigate the cm at high temperatures to confirm its vanishing ( merging with the soft mode response ) above @xmath18 .",
    "lattice dynamics of pmn was studied by means of raman , ir and inelastic neutron scattering spectroscopy@xcite .",
    "it was shown@xcite that the lowest frequency transverse optic phonon ( to@xmath22 ) @xmath23 follows the cochran law @xmath24 with the extrapolated critical temperature near the burns temperature @xmath17k .",
    "it indicates that the to@xmath22 frequency @xmath23 can be assigned to the fe soft mode ( sm ) in polar clusters .",
    "the questions arise : is it the general behavior typical for all fe relaxors ?",
    "what is the behavior of relaxors with the spontaneous fe phase transition ( pt ) ? does the soft mode feel the fe pt temperature @xmath15 ( like in other displacive fes ) or rather the burns temperature which is typically 300 - 400@xmath1  above @xmath15 ?",
    "the phonons in bulk pst were already studied by raman@xcite and ir spectroscopy@xcite and no optic mode softening was observed .",
    "only small anomalies in phonon frequencies were seen in the raman and ir spectra near @xmath15 . from",
    "that it was concluded that the transition is of the order - disorder type , which is , however , rather unusual for perovskite fes .",
    "also the question of phonon activity in the raman spectra is of interest .",
    "factor - group analysis for the pm3 m space group in the paraelectric phase , corresponding to disordered pst , predicts three f@xmath25 only ir active phonons and one silent f@xmath26 mode so that no phonons should be raman active .",
    "nevertheless , a number of modes were observed in the raman spectra of paraelectric phase .",
    "siny _ _ et al.__@xcite and independently bismayer _",
    "_ et al.__@xcite explained the activity of the phonons in raman spectra by doubling of the unit cell in the paraelectric phase due to the 1:1 b - site ordering . in this case",
    "the space group is fm@xmath27 m and the factor group analysis yields the following optic vibration modes :",
    "@xmath28    it means that 4  raman and distinct 4  ir active modes should be expected in the spectra .",
    "however , first - order raman lines are seen not only in b - sites ordered samples , but also in the disordered pst and in other relaxors like pmn .",
    "_ et al.__@xcite explained this raman activity by local short - range b - site ordering in chemical clusters .",
    "namely , raman scattering is sensitive to short - range ( nm ) order , as the mode activity is given by the phonon eigenvectors which are determined by the interatomic force constants .",
    "another assignment was suggested recently by hlinka _ _",
    "et al.__@xcite .",
    "they argued that raman scattering in relaxors is primarily due to anisotropic polar clusters rather than to 1:1 b - site ordering .",
    "it would mean that the raman - activated modes belong prevailingly to the brillouin - zone center of the parent pm3 m cubic structure rather than to modes activated by the zone folding as it was assumed by siny _",
    "et al . _",
    "also results of the pulsed neutron atomic pair - density function analysis by egami _ _ et al.__@xcite speak in favor of such a picture .",
    "they have shown that the burns temperature @xmath29 is the local curie temperature below which the polar clusters are formed , but the local polarization of pb persists up to @xmath30k several hundreds of kelvins above @xmath18 .",
    "probably both mechanisms of mode activation in raman spectra have to be considered and to distinguish between them requires more detailed studies , particularly at very high temperatures near the b - site ordering temperature .",
    "comparison of the raman spectra with properly evaluated ir spectra is also necessary .",
    "factor - group analysis in the r3 m rhombohedral ferroelectric phase with the doubled unit cell due to b - site ordering yields the following optic modes : @xmath31 and @xmath32 acoustic modes .",
    "it means that up to 16 to modes simultaneously raman and ir active plus corresponding 16 lo raman active modes can be expected in the spectra of the ferroelectric phase .",
    "ir active modes in bulk pst ceramics were studied by means of ir reflectivity@xcite .",
    "the spectra revealed correlation between the degree of 1:1 b - site ordering and appearance of an extra mode at 315@xmath2 .",
    "the high - frequency wing of the cm was observed above room temperature in the reflectivity spectra below 30@xmath2 .",
    "however , the accuracy of ir reflectivity technique is limited at low frequencies and high temperatures . in this case transmission measurements",
    "are more accurate and more sensitive to absorption mechanisms , but for this purpose , due to high absorption , thin films are needed .",
    "the aim of this study is to investigate temperature dependence of the low - frequency polar phonons and cm in pst films with various b - site order in a broad temperature interval 20 - 900@xmath1 .",
    "it should allow us to shed more light on the lattice and polar - cluster dynamics between @xmath15 and the burns temperature @xmath29 .",
    "pst thin films were prepared by chemical solution deposition on sapphire substrates , which are transparent in the far ir @xcite .",
    "four films of various degree of order were investigated : disordered ( annealed at 700@xmath33c for 1@xmath20min ) , slightly ordered ( annealed at 850@xmath33c for 1@xmath20min ) , 50% ordered ( annealed at 850@xmath33c for 1@xmath20hour ) and 78% highly ordered ( annealed at 800@xmath33c for 48@xmath20hours ) .",

    ". a  new heavily damped ( i.e. @xmath48 ) excitation appears on cooling below 700@xmath1 at frequencies near 30@xmath2 .",
    "this mode is not manifested by a minimum in the ir transmission spectra , but rather by enhanced broad absorption at below 40@xmath2 .",
    "this excitation does not seem to be of usual one - phonon origin , and we assign it to dynamics of polar clusters ( i.e. cm ) .",
    "disappearance of the cm above 700@xmath1 is manifested by an enhancement of the low - frequency transmission , although the high - frequency transmission continues to decrease on heating , as expected due to increase in damping of polar phonons and multi - phonon absorption ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : psto_trans ] ) .",
    "on cooling to @xmath49300@xmath1 , cm slows down to microwave range and vanishes below @xmath15 from our spectral range .",
    "another heavily damped excitation arises in our ir spectra below @xmath15 near 30@xmath2  and remains in the spectra down to the lowest temperatures .",
    "the origin of this excitation was not fully understood until recently ( in analogy to pmn , where it also appears , @xcite it could be explained by activation of the acoustic phonon branches due to the local unit cell doubling or translation symmetry breaking ) .",
    "however , now it seems to us more probable that it is just the e component of the split f@xmath50 sm ( for this explanation see below ) .",
    "let us stress that our static permittivity in fig .",
    "[ fig : psto_eps ] does not correspond to experimental low - frequency permittivity , because strong dielectric dispersion exists below the phonon frequencies.@xcite bovtun _",
    "combined high - frequency and microwave dielectric spectra of pst ceramics between 1 mhz and 36 ghz@xcite with the ir reflectivity spectra @xcite and revealed two dispersion regions below phonons .",
    "one , nearly temperature independent , was estimated to near 1thz and corresponds well to our heavily damped mode near 30@xmath2  below t@xmath51 .",
    "second relaxation was seen at temperatures below 350@xmath1  in the high - frequency range and it slows down and broadens on cooling . at higher temperatures it merges with the far ir spectra so that it corresponds to the relaxation below t@xmath52 near 30@xmath2  assigned to the dynamics of polar nanoclusters .",
    "this relaxation is responsible for the pronounced dielectric anomaly near and above t@xmath51 .",
    "the relaxation does not completely vanish at low temperatures , because our dielectric data at 1mhz and 8ghz obtained on pst thin films of various b - site order show permittivity between 300 and 400 at 20@xmath1,@xcite whereas the phonon contribution to permittivity is only about 100 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : psto_eps ] ) .",
    "this is not surprising because a small dielectric dispersion ( constant dielectric losses ) was observed in many relaxors at low temperatures.@xcite    the lowest - frequency phonon ( marked to@xmath22 ) with the symmetry f@xmath25 has the frequency near 45@xmath2 at high temperatures . it starts to harden below 550@xmath1 and it seems to split below @xmath15 . for illustration , in fig .",
    "[ fig : psto_mod ] we fitted the temperature dependences of both components by the cochran law , but rather different extrapolated critical temperatures ( 700 and 1000 k , respectively ) were obtained .",
    "the realistic value could be somewhere in between , but anyway , the softening ceased near 600 k and above the burns temperature of about 700 k the expected hardening is not appreciable .",
    "both components of the to@xmath22 sm have their counterparts also in raman spectra,@xcite , but the assignment of the modes in raman spectra is more speculative .",
    "one mode near 56@xmath2  dominates the raman spectrum below 100@xmath2  in the paraelectric phase.@xcite if we assume that it is raman active due to the b - site ordering , it should be of f@xmath7 symmetry , stemming from the brillouin zone boundary of simple cubic perovskite structure .",
    "its frequency is by about 10@xmath2  higher than that of the f@xmath50 mode in our ir spectra ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psto_mod ] ) . at low temperatures",
    "a triplet appears in raman spectra with frequencies about 50 , 60 ( strong peak ) and 80@xmath2  ( at 100@xmath1).@xcite the mode near 80@xmath2  corresponds to the a@xmath5 component of our to@xmath5 sm , which may activate in raman spectra below t@xmath51 .",
    "the mode near 50@xmath2  could be assigned to the e component of the cubic f@xmath7 mode and is seen only in raman spectra , although it could be also ( weakly ) ir active .",
    "the mode near 60@xmath2  frequency could correspond to the e component of the to@xmath5 sm ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : psto_mod ] ) or to a@xmath5 mode from the split f@xmath7 mode .",
    "the latter explanation is more realistic because this mode is the strongest one in the raman spectra , and its strength decreases in ir spectra with increasing disorder at the b - sites ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : pstvar_tr ] ) .",
    "this would mean that the mode near 30@xmath2  should be assigned to the e component of the polar sm ( f@xmath50 ) .",
    "this mode should remain ir active up to 700@xmath1  due to the dielectric anisotropy in polar clusters@xcite , but it is probably screened by the cm at high temperatures .",
    "this assignment sheds a new light on softening of both modes near 80 and 60@xmath2 .",
    "the higher - frequency mode softens and because both modes are of the same a@xmath5 symmetry so that they can bilinearly couple which results also in partial softening of the lower - frequency mode due to the mode repulsion .",
    "let us discuss the question how the polar - phonon parameters in pst are influenced by the different b - site ordering .",
    "the difference is best remarkable at 20@xmath1 , where the phonon damping is minimized and the phonons up to 400@xmath2 can be resolved in our ir spectra .",
    "transmission spectra of four pst films with various order are compared at 20@xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ fig : pstvar_tr ] .",
    "one can see that the to@xmath36 splitting ( two minima near 230@xmath2 ) is appreciable only in the highest ordered film .",
    "to@xmath22 splitting below 100@xmath2  is less and less pronounced with the decrease in ordering , but mostly due to the increase in the linewidths .",
    "let us note that the film annealed at 850@xmath33c for 1@xmath20min does not show any ordering in xrd,@xcite however remarkable difference between the disordered and 1@xmath20min ordered film is seen in our ir spectra .",
    "it shows that some short range ordering occurs already in the 1@xmath20min annealed film , but xrd is not sensitive enough to see it .",
    "reaney _ _ et al.__@xcite correlated the intensity of sc - ta stretching mode in pst seen at 315@xmath2 with the degree of b - site order .",
    "one can see this mode clearly in 50% and 78% ordered films , in the other two samples only a  weak shoulder appears ( fig .",
    "[ fig : pstvar_tr ] ) .",
    "unfortunately , we can not establish any quantitative correlation between the intensity of this mode and the degree of order .",
    "namely , the spectra of 78% ordered and disordered films were measured on substrates which were not polished on the bottom surface , while the other two substrates were well polished on both surfaces . matted bottom surface causes parasitic diffuse scattering of the ir beam at higher frequencies which is responsible for the lower value of the transmission peak at 400@xmath2 in the corresponding film spectra . fortunately , the quality of the rear substrate surface has no influence on our spectra below 200@xmath2  because the ir beam with wavelength larger than 50@xmath35 m does not feel its roughness .",
    "temperature dependences of the mode frequencies in disordered pst film are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pstdis_mod ] .",
    "the mode near 60@xmath2  appears only below 100@xmath1 due to the line broadening compared to ordered film",
    ". its lower strength than in ordered sample gives evidence that it is the a@xmath5 component of the f@xmath7 raman mode .",
    "the a@xmath5 component of the to@xmath22 sm exhibits behavior similar to that in the 78% ordered film : it softens on heating towards the burns temperature which ceases above 700@xmath1 .",
    "cm appears below 650@xmath1 and slows down below our spectral range on cooling .",
    "the new heavily damped mode ( probably the e component of the f@xmath50 sm ) appears below @xmath15 at 30@xmath2 .",
    "this mode was observed in all studied pst films as well as in the pmn film@xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "we suggested that the overdamping of the sm in the inelastic neutron scattering spectra of pmn ( so called `` waterfall '' effect ) is only an apparent effect .",
    "we suggested that the sm were underdamped ( as in ir spectra ) but disappeared from the neutron spectra due to its overlapping with the cm which approached the thz range near @xmath18 .",
    "the sm and cm behavior in pmn and pst is therefore very similar , but to our knowledge , pst was not studied by inelastic neutron scattering so that no similar comparison is possible .    in conclusion , our ir transmission spectra of variously ordered pst thin films show qualitatively the same behavior : soft to@xmath22 phonon of f@xmath50 symmetry splits on cooling below the burns temperature .",
    "a@xmath5 component hardens and follows the cochran law with extrapolated critical temperature slightly above the burns temperature .",
    "the low - frequency e component is clearly seen at low temperatures , but it is probably active up to t@xmath52 , where it is screened by the overdamped cm with similar frequency . cm stemming from dynamics of polar clusters appears below the burns temperature and slows down to @xmath15 . similar behavior was observed also in the pmn relaxor,@xcite so it seems that such a phonon and cm behavior is general for most perovskite relaxor ferroelectrics .",
