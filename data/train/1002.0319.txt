    "in fermi energy heavy ion collisions , fragments are copiously produced .",
    "the mass distributions of these fragments exhibit a power low behavior which has been discussed in terms of the modified fisher model  @xcite .",
    "the isotope distributions of these fragments play a key role in these analyses .",
    "theoretical studies indicate that the isotope formation is governed by the free energy at the density and temperature of the emitting system .",
    "the experimental observation of isoscaling for two similar reactions with different neutron to proton ratios , n / z , demonstrates that the free energies and therefore the yields of the fragments are also closely related to the n / z of the emitting system  @xcite .",
    "thus the experimental yield of isotope with n neutrons and z protons can be given by  @xcite : @xmath1/t\\ } \\label{eq : yield}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is a constant and g(n , z ) is the nuclear free energy at the time of the fragment formation .",
    "@xmath3 and @xmath4 are the chemical potential of neutron and proton , and t is the temperature of the emitting source .",
    "the factor f(n , z ) is the correction factor for the feeding from the statistical decay processes .",
    "the factor , @xmath5 , originates from the entropy of the fragment  @xcite . the symmetry energy term in the free energy , g(n , z ) ,",
    "is usually expressed as : @xmath6 where a = n+z and @xmath7 is the symmetry energy coefficient which depends on the nuclear density @xmath8 and the temperature t of the emitting source .    from eq.([eq :",
    "yield ] ) @xmath9 , the ratio of the isotope yields for two similar reaction systems with different n / z ratios , can be written as : @xmath10 this relation is known as the isoscaling relation .",
    "the isoscaling parameters , @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) are the differences of the neutron or proton chemical potentials between the systems 1 and 2 , divided by the temperature .",
    "c is a constant .",
    "system 1 is normally taken as the more neutron rich of the two .    as discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite , the isoscaling parameters and the symmetry energy coefficient are closely related . for a multifragmentation regime , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , this relation is given by : @xmath13 where @xmath14 for the two reaction systems and @xmath15 is the average mass number of isotopes for a given z.    there are two issues for the determination of the @xmath7 values in eq.([eq : alpha ] ) .",
    "one is the source temperature t. since the beginning of the experimental study of heavy ion collisions in the multifragmentation regime , significant efforts have been made to extract the source temperature , but different methods of temperature extraction can lead to different results and uncertainties still remain  @xcite .",
    "another issue is the effect of the secondary decay process , expressed by f(n , z ) in eq.([eq : yield ] ) . in experiments fragments",
    "have typically cooled down to the ground state before they are detected .",
    "indeed , in previous works , excitation energies of the primary fragments have been evaluated by studying the associated light charged particle multiplicities  @xcite .",
    "such data raise the question of the degree of confidence for the experimentally extracted symmetry energy coefficient , in which this important effect is not properly corrected .",
    "in fact in a separate paper using the same data set presented here we have demonstrated that the secondary decay processes significantly effect the isobaric yield ratios and the experimentally extracted symmetry energy coefficient  @xcite . in this paper , we focus on the relation between the ratio @xmath0 and isoscaling parameters and between the ratio and the widths of the isotope distributions .",
    "the experimentally extracted values of @xmath0 extracted from both observables are compared to those extracted from the model calculations .",
    "the experiment was performed at the k-500 superconducting cyclotron facility at texas a@xmath16 m university . @xmath17zn and",
    "@xmath18ni beams were used to irradiate @xmath19ni , @xmath20sn , @xmath21au and @xmath22th targets at 40 a mev .",
    "intermediate mass fragments ( imfs ) were detected by a detector telescope placed at 20@xmath23 .",
    "the telescope consisted of four si detectors .",
    "each si detector was 5 cm x 5 cm .",
    "the nominal thicknesses were 129 , 300 , 1000 , 1000 @xmath24 m .",
    "all si detectors were segmented into four sections and each quadrant had a 5@xmath23 opening angle in polar and azimuthal angles .",
    "therefore the energies of the fragments were measured at two polar angles of the quadrant detector , namely @xmath25 = 17.5@xmath23 @xmath26 2.5@xmath23 and @xmath25 = 22.5@xmath23 @xmath26 2.5@xmath23 .",
    "typically 6 - 8 isotopes for a given atomic numbe up to z=18 were clearly identified with the energy threshold of 4 - 10 a mev , using the @xmath27e - e technique for any two consecutive detectors .",
    "the @xmath27e - e spectrum was linearized empirically .",
    "mass identification of the isotopes were made using a range - energy table  @xcite . in the analysis code , isotopes are identified by a parameter @xmath28 . for the isotope with a=2z ,",
    "@xmath28 = z is assigned and other isotopes are identified by interpolation between them .",
    "typical @xmath28 spectra are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the energy spectrum of each isotope was extracted by gating the isotope in a 2d plot of @xmath28 vs energy .",
    "the yields of light charged particles ( lcps ) in coincidence with imfs were also measured using 16 single crystal csi(tl ) detectors of 3 cm thickness set around the target . the light output from each detector",
    "was read by a photo multiplier tube .",
    "the pulse shape discrimination method was used to identify p , d , t , h and @xmath29 particles .",
    "the energy calibration for these particles were performed using si detectors ( 50 -300 @xmath24 m ) in front of the csi detectors in separate runs .",
    "the yield of each isotope was evaluated , using a moving source fit . for lcps ,",
    "three sources ( projectile - like(plf ) , nucleon - nucleon - like(nn ) and target - like ( tlf ) ) were used .",
    "the nn - like sources have source velocities of about a half of the beam velocity .",
    "the parameters are searched globally for all 16 angles . for imfs , since the energy spectra were measured only at the two angles of the quadrant detector , the spectra were parameterized using a single nn - source . using a source with a smeared source velocity around half the beam velocity , the fitting parameters were first determined from the spectrum summed over all isotopes for a given z , assuming a=2z . then",
    "all extracted parameters except for the normalizing yield parameter were used for the individual isotopes .",
    "this procedure was based on the assumption that , when the spectrum is plotted in energy per nucleon , the shape of the energy spectrum is the same for all isotopes for a given z. indeed the observed energy spectra of isotopes are well reproduced by this method . for imfs ,",
    "a further correction was made for the background .",
    "as seen in fig.1 , the isotopes away from the stability line , such as @xmath30c and @xmath31 mg , have a very small yields and the background contribution is significant . in order to evaluate the background contribution to the extracted yield from the source fit , a two gaussian fit to each isotope combined with a linear background",
    "the fits are shown in fig.1 .",
    "each peak consists of two gaussians .",
    "the second gaussian ( about 10% of the height of the first one ) is added to reproduce the shape of the valley between two isotopes .",
    "this component is attributed to the reactions of the isotope in the si detector .",
    "the centroid of the gaussians was set to the value calculated from the range - energy table within a small margin .",
    "the final yield of an isotope was determined by correcting the yield evaluated from the moving source fit by the ratio between the two gaussian yields and the linear background .",
    "rather large errors ( @xmath32 ) are assigned for the multiplicity of the nn source for imfs , originating from the source fit besides the background estimation .",
