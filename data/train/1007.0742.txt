    "the megaparsec matter distribution in the universe represents a dynamical system of great structural and topological complexity , the cosmic web .",
    "early attempts to map the large scale distribution of galaxies in the universe @xcite revealed that galaxies are far from being evenly distributed across the nearby universe . on the contrary ,",
    "the mass distribution delineated by galaxies seems to form an intricate network of compact and dense associations interconnected by tenuous  bridges \" or  filaments \" surrounded by surprisingly vast empty regions @xcite .",
    "these preliminary studies suggested that the universe on the large scales could be described as a cellular system @xcite or a _ cosmic web _ @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed in recent times by large galaxy surveys like the 2dfgrs @xcite , the sloan digital sky survey ( * ? ? ?",
    "* e.g. ) and the 2mass redshift survey @xcite .",
    "the advent of these large 3-d maps of the local universe unveiled a cosmos of considerable richness and complexity , featuring intricate filamentary structures .",
    "these structures can be seen on scales from a few megaparsecs up to tens and even hundreds of megaparsecs .",
    "they include immense elongated and semi - planar patterns @xcite and includes huge wall - like structures like the coma great wall @xcite and the sloan great wall @xcite , with its size of more than 400@xmath6 the largest known structure in the nearby universe .",
    "similar weblike structures have also been discovered at high redshifts @xcite .",
    "the cosmic web can be seen as the most salient manifestation of the anisotropic nature of gravitational collapse , the motor behind the formation of structure in the cosmos @xcite .",
    "n - body computer simulations have profusely illustrated how a primordial field of tiny gaussian density perturbations transforms into a pronounced and intricate filigree of filamentary features , dented by dense compact clumps at the nodes of the network @xcite .",
    "the filaments connect into the cluster nodes and act as the transport channels along which matter flows into the clusters .",
    "fundamental understanding of anisotropic collapse on cosmological scales came with the seminal study by @xcite , who recognized the key role of the large scale tidal force field in shaping the cosmic web ( also see * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "in addition to the anisotropic nature of gravitational collapse , the multiscale character of the cosmic mass distribution is also an important characteristic signature of the gravitational formation of structure @xcite .",
    "cosmic structure formation is a hierarchical process as a result of the amplitude distribution of fluctuations over the different scales .",
    "small scale fluctuations in scenarios with a primordial power spectrum @xmath8 , where @xmath9 , have a larger amplitude than the ones on larger scales . as a result , collapsed clumps of matter will aggregate into larger systems and eventually merge to form even larger structures .",
    "the description of the megaparsec matter distribution as an interconnected network or a cosmic web is not a coincidence .",
    "while the zeldovich approximation describes the evolution of a cellular distribution made up of pancakes , it does not really offer an explicit dynamical expalnation for the observed connectivity between morphologies .",
    "early computer simulations already indicated the close connection between each morphological component , namely that clusters sit at the intersection of filaments and filaments are formed at the intersection of walls @xcite .",
    "@xcite introduced the `` cosmic web '' theory , which provides a natural explanation for the emergence of the filamentary network as well as the relation between the morphological components of the cosmic web .",
    "the theory emphasizes the close relation between the peaks in the density field and the overall weblike network : _ knowledge of the tidal field at a few relevant locations in a region provides all the information needed to predict the resulting large scale matter configuration_. in the primordial density field this can be traced back to the simple quadrupolar pattern in the density distribution implied by a local shear configuration ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "this distribution will naturally evolve into a cluster - filament - cluster configuration , the structural basis of the cosmic web .    .",
    "only the largest structures are shown for clarity.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]      despite the multitude of elaborate qualitative descriptions it has remained a major challenge to characterize the structure , geometry and topology of the cosmic web .",
    "quantities as basic and general as the mass and volume content of clusters , filaments , walls and voids are still not well established or defined .",
    "since there is not yet a common framework to objectively define filaments and walls , the comparison of results of different studies concerning properties of the filamentary network  such as their internal structure and dynamics , evolution in time , and connectivity properties  is usually rendered cumbersome and/or difficult .",
    "the overwhelming complexity of the individual structures as well as their connectivity , the lack of structural symmetries , its intrinsic multiscale nature and the wide range of densities that one finds in the cosmic matter distribution has prevented the use of a simple and straightforward tool box . over the years",
    ", a variety of heuristic measures were proposed to analyze specific aspects of the spatial patterns in the large scale universe . only in recent years these",
    "have lead to a more solid and well - defined machinery for the description and quantitative analysis of the intricate and complex spatial patterns of the cosmic web .",
    "nearly without exception , these methods borrow extensively from other branches of science such as image processing , mathematical morphology , computational geometry and medical imaging .",
    "the connectedness of elongated supercluster structures in the cosmic matter distribution was first probed by means of percolation analysis , introduced and emphasized by zeldovich and coworkers @xcite , while a related graph - theoretical construct , the minimum spanning tree of the galaxy distribution , was extensively probed and analysed by bhavsar and collaborators @xcite in an attempt to develop an objective measure of filamentarity . finding filaments joining neighbouring clusters has been tackled , using quite different techniques , by @xcite and by @xcite .    more general filament finders have been put forward by a number of authors .",
    "following specific physical criteria , @xcite recently proposed an interesting and promising combination of a tessellation - based density estimator and a dynamical binding energy criterion . a thorough mathematical nonparametric formalism involving the medial axis of a point cloud , as yet for 2-d point distributions , has recently been proposed by @xcite .",
    "it is based on a geometric representation of filaments as the medial axis of the data distribution .",
    "also solidly rooted within a geometric and mathematical context is the more generic geometric inference formalism developed by @xcite .",
    "it allows the recovery of geometric and topological features of the supposedly underlying density field from a sampled point cloud on the basis of distance functions .",
    "@xcite use a generalization of the classical candy model to locate and catalogue filaments in galaxy surveys .",
    "this approach has the advantage that it works directly with the original point process and does not require the creation of a continuous density field .",
    "however , computationally it is very demanding .",
    "the more recent formalisms that are intent on characterizing the full range of weblike formalisms usually exploit the morphological information in the gradient and hessian of the density field or potential field , i.e. the tidal field ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "it identifies morphological features with the maxima and saddle points in the density field and results in an elegant and mathematically rigorous tool for filament identification .",
    "however , it is computationally intensive , focusses mostly on the filaments and is strongly dependent on the smoothing scale of the density field . a more elaborate classification scheme on the basis of the manifolds in the tidal field",
    " involving all morphological features in the cosmic matter distribution  has been proposed by @xcite ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "its great virtue is that it is based on the structure of the tidal field , which links it directly to our theoretical understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmic web .",

    "usually , this allows a more detailed view of the intricacies of the multiscale matter distribution , although it is usually more sensitive to noise and more indirectly coupled to the underlying dynamics of structure formation than the tidal field morphology . a single scale dissection of the large scale density field into its various morphological components based on",
    "the has been followed by @xcite , and applied to n - body simulations and galaxy redshift samples ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in this study",
    "we follow the more elaborate multiscale formalism of the multiscale morphology filter ( mmf ) , introduced by @xcite .",
    "the mmf assigns a morphology of the local density field in terms of its multiscale second order variations in the local density field .",
    "instead of restricting the analysis to one particular scale , the mmf explicitly adresses the multiscale nature of the cosmic density field by evaluating the density field hessian over a range of spatial scales and determining at which scales and locations the various morphological signatures are most prominent .",
    "it represents a complete and self - consistent framework that allows us to identify and isolate specific morphologies in an objective way .",
    "a somewhat similar multiscale approach is the metric space technique described by @xcite , who applied it to a morphological analysis of the dr5 of the sdss .",
    "a more recent development is that of the spineweb procedure @xcite , which traces the various features of the cosmic web on pure topological grounds by invoking the _ watershed transform_. the watershed transform is a key instrument for the segmentation of a density field , and as such is also ideally suited for tracing the boundaries between the identified segments .",
    "spineweb identifies the filaments and sheets with the boundaries of watershed basins .",
    "the latter are the influence areas in and around cosmic voids .",
    "one of the main reasons for our interest in outlining the filamentary cosmic web concerns the question whether and to what extent the weblike environment influences the properties and evolution of galaxies .",
    "most studies of environmental influences limit themselves to the density , but various indications argue for a more intricate connection .    in at least one aspect we may immediately suspect a significant relation between the tidally induced morphological nature of the cosmic environment and the galaxy . the tidally induced rotation of galaxies implies a link between the galaxy formation process and the surrounding external matter distribution . with the cosmic web as a direct manifestation of the large large scale tidal field ,",
    "we would thereofre expect a connection with the angular momentum of galaxies or galaxy halos . the theoretical studies of @xcite and @xcite were important in pointing out that this connection should be visible in the orientation of galaxy spins with the surrounding large scale structure .",
    "equipped with some of the filament and wall detection techniques described above , recent @xmath26-body simulations have been able to find , amongst others , that the filamentary or sheetlike nature of the environment has a distinct influence on the shape and spin orientation of dark matter haloes @xcite . in the case of haloes located in large scale walls , they seem to agree that both the spin vector and the major axis of inertia lie in the plane of the wall . in the case of the alignment of halos with their embedding filaments , @xcite and @xcite found evidence for a mass and redshift dependence , which has been confirmed by the studies of @xcite and @xcite .    while the multiscale morphology filter @xcite proved succesfull in elucidating halo shape and spin alignment characteristics in filaments and sheets in n - body simulations @xcite , in recent work @xcite also succeeded in identifying and tracing filaments in the sdss survey which contained manifestly aligned galaxies . in this paper",
    "we use the multiscale morphology filter ( mmf ) to look in more detail at the intrinsic properties of the weblike structures themselves .",
    "we address the cosmic web in terms of its basic morphologies  clusters , filaments and walls  identified on the basis of the multiscale morphology filter ( mmf ) .",
    "we will mainly focus on filaments given the fact that they are the most prominent components of the cosmic web and largely delineate its outline .",
    "walls are far less prominent , more tenuous and highly complex .",
    "we will therefore pay less attention to them . in some cases we will also include clusters and voids in our analysis but always in the context of the filament - wall network . instead of seeking to provide a comprehensive list of properties of the morphologies in the cosmic web",
    ", this work presents a general view of the cosmic web from the point of view of their morphological components and introduces some tools for their characterization .",
    "some of our results confirm previous findings , while others have not been presented before .",
    "this study is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : nbody ] we describe the cosmological simulation on which this work is based , including the resampling of the discrete particle set into a regular grid of density values using the adaptive and morphology preserving dtfe technique . section  [ sec : mmf ] briefly describes the steps followed in the morphological characterization of the cosmic web by means of the mmf .",
    "section  [ sec : webcomp ] contains a qualitative presentation of the various morphological components of the cosmic web , while the corresponding quantitative inventory in terms of mass , volume and density is the subject of section  [ sec : webmass ] .    in section  [ sec : filament ] we proceed to describe the filamentary network and some of its global properties such as mass function , length distribution , and density profiles .",
    "finally , we summarize our findings in section  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the work presented here is based on a cosmological n - body simulation containing only dark matter particles .",
    "the simulation follows the evolution of a set of particles `` tracing '' the underlying density field from a given set of initial conditions until the present time .",
    "we adopted the concordance @xmath0cdm cosmological model @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 .",
    "its size ( 150 @xmath6 ) makes it suitable to study large structures comparable to those seen in present galaxy surveys .",
    "the large number of particles ( @xmath18 ) allows us to achieve a mass resolution of @xmath31 m@xmath3 h@xmath4 per particle .",
    "the mass resolution and simulation box were chosen as a compromise between a box large enough to contain a significant amount of large structures and at the same time the ability to resolve haloes down to a few times @xmath32 m@xmath3 ( given the computational resources available ) . the simulation was performed using the public version of the parallel tree - pm code gadget2 @xcite , running on 8 double processor nodes on the linux cluster at the university of groningen .",
    "initial conditions at redshift @xmath33 with @xmath18 dark matter particles were generated using the transfer function given by @xcite .",
    "we stored 20 snapshots starting at redshift 9 in logarithmic intervals of the expansion factor until the present time .",
    "additionally we generated @xmath21 and @xmath24 versions following the  averaging \" prescription described in @xcite .",
    "these lower resolution simulations were used to compute the density fields and to get a preliminary impression of the structures present in the simulation box ( see table 1 and fig .  [",
    "fig : mmf150h_particles_haloes ] ) .    * the low resolution version ( @xmath34 ) is used to compute some properties of filaments such as linear density and for visualization purposes .",
    "this resolution per particle of this simulation allows us to resolve the main features of the large scale distribution and at the same time is sparse enough to allow a clear visualization of the particles ( see figure [ fig : mmf150h_particles_haloes ] ) .",
    "this is the simulation we use when ( in the following sections ) we refer to dark matter particles , unless we state something different . * the intermediate resolution ( @xmath35 )",
    "is used to compute density fields in order to take full advantage of the spatial information with the computing resources available . * the high resolution version ( @xmath36 ) is used to produce the hop and frachop halo and subhalo catalogues ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : haloes ] ) .      the output of the n - body simulation consist of a discrete set of particles .",
    "this is translated into a continuum volume - filling density field sampled on a regular three dimensional grid .",
    "crucial for the ability of the multiscale morphology filter to identify anisotropic features such as filaments and walls is the use of a morphologically unbiased and optimized continuous density field retaining all features visible in a discrete galaxy or particle distribution .",
    "we therefore use the delaunay tessellation field estimator ( dtfe ) , introduced by @xcite ( see @xcite for extensive descriptions ) , to reconstruct the underlying density field .",
    "it uses the voronoi and delaunay tessellation of the particle distribution to obtain a optimal local density estimate and subsequently interpolate these values linearly over the simulation volume",
    ". for our purpose of detecting weblike features the dtfe method has several important characteristics :    1 .",
    "the self - adaptive nature of the delaunay tessellation , and resulting sensitivity to all levels of substructure present in the particle distribution , makes it highly suited for a multi - resolution analysis of the hierarchically evolved large scale matter distribution .",
    "2 .   the delaunay tessellation follows the intrinsic anisotropies of the spatial matter distribution , resulting in a density field reconstruction which accurately traces and outlines the intricate and complex spatial patterns in the cosmic web .",
    "3 .   it does not introduce significant artificial features .",
    "the main artefacts concern diffuse low - density tetrahedral wings at the boundary between dense and underdense regions and a rather noisy reconstruction of the underdense regions .",
    "figure [ fig : mmf150h_particles_dtfe ] shows a slice of 25 @xmath6 along the @xmath37 axis of a subbox of @xmath38 .",
    "the top left panel shows the particle distribution and the top right panel shows the corresponding dtfe density field .",
    "a zoomed region is shown in the bottom panel .",
    "dtfe yields a density field reconstruction in which nearly all structures present in the particle distribution are represented .",
    "it finds highly dense clumps of matter , as well as the tenuous voids .",
    "also note the absence of artificial blobs in the inner regions of the voids .",
    "an additional virtue concerns the absence of a gridlike imprint in the dtfe density field , even while this is still visible in the particle distribution .",
    "accordingly , dtfe is used to process the particle distribution into a continuous density field @xmath39 ( top centre frame , fig .",
    "[ fig : mmf150h_particles_dtfe ] ) .",
    "we used the hop group finder @xcite for the identification of self - bound virialized haloes .",
    "each of these haloes is considered a parent candidate which may contain one or more subhaloes .",
    "hop links particles by associating each particle to the densest of its n - closest neighbors , until it finally reaches the particle that is its own densest neighbor . for allocating particles to their halos we applied hop with standard parameters @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "although the groups identified with hop are nearly identical to those found with fof @xcite , they are less prone to involve artificial bridges between close groups .",
    "galactic haloes embedded in groups of galaxies and clusters of galaxies are identified with subhaloes in the computer simulation .",
    "they are the bound groups that are clearly defined against the diffuse background particles that form the halo in which they are embedded . in order to identify the bound subhaloes inside",
    "larger groups otherwise identified as single virialized objects , we use the frachop algorithm developed by @xcite .",
    "it is an elaboration of the hop halo finder @xcite and exploits the topological properties of nested local maxima smoothed on a fixed scale .",
    "it starts by rerunning hop , exclusively for the particles identified with parent halos in the first hop halo identification step . to this end",
    ", it uses a gaussian smoothed density field with a kernel size of @xmath43h@xmath4 kpc , so that substructure on smaller scale is suppressed .",
    "the subhalo identification is performed without running regroup , so that all particles are assigned to their local maximum in the smoothed density field .",
    "the center of mass of each of the resulting candidate subhaloes is determined iteratively , while unbound particles are removed .",
    "the end product is a listing of the subhaloes within the simulation box .",
    "figure [ fig : mmf150h_particles_haloes ] shows the distribution of particles in the @xmath24 and @xmath21 simulations as well as the distribution of hop and frachop haloes plotted on top of the density field .",
    "both hop and frachop haloes closely follow the patterns of the cosmic web , revealing that haloes are fair tracers of the large scale matter distribution .",
    "the only difference between the two is that a given hop halo can be formed by several frachop haloes .",
    "the distribution of haloes delineates the cosmic web in a more sparse and smooth way compared to the particles .    0.5truecm",
    "the multiscale morphology filter ( mmf ) is used for identifying and characterizing the different morphological elements of the large scale matter distribution in the cosmic web @xcite .",
    "the formalism has been developed on the basis of visualization and feature extraction techniques in computer vision and medical research @xcite .",
    "the technology , finding its origin in computer vision research , has been optimized within the context of feature detections in medical imaging . @xcite and @xcite presented its operation for the specific situation of detecting the web of blood vessels in a medical image .",
    "the mmf morphological segmentation takes account of the multiscale nature of the matter distribution by means of a scale space analysis , looking for morphological structures of mathematically specified type in a multiscale , scale independent , manner .",
    "the scale space analysis presumes that the specific structural characteristic is quantified by some appropriate parameter .",
    "examples are density , eccentricity , orientation and curvature .",
    "the mmf filters these data to produce a hierarchy of maps having different resolutions , and subsequently selects at each point the dominant parameter value from the hierarchy in order to construct a scale independent map .",
    "the mmf - based dissection and visualization of the cosmic web in its three basic components allows us to concentrate on the significant features of the cosmic matter distribution , and reach a level of abstraction by avoiding spurious details . for the visualization of the intricate filament - cluster network",
    "this is particularly useful . in this section",
    "we briefly summarize the steps involved in the morphological segmentation of the cosmic web obtained from the n - body cosmological simulation .",

    "the hessian is renormalized , @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the filter width that has been used .",
    "the eigenvalues @xmath67 of the hessian matrix determine the local morphological signal , dictated by the local shape of the density distribution .",
    "a small eigenvalue indicates a low rate of change of the field values in the corresponding eigen - direction , and vice versa .",
    "we denote these eigenvalues by @xmath68 and arrange them so that @xmath69 : @xmath70 the @xmath71 are coordinate independent descriptors of the behaviour of the density field in the locality of the point @xmath72 and can be combined to create a variety of morphological indicators .",

    "evidently , the eigenvalues corresponding to a blob ( cluster ) morphology are a subset of the eigenvalue subset related to filamentary morphologies . in turn , the eigenvalue set of the latter is a subset of the wall eigenvalues .      in practice , we are interested in the local morphology as a function of scale . in order to establish how it changes with scale , we evaluate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the renormalised hessian @xmath73 of each dataset in the scale space @xmath58 .",
    "since we are looking for three distinct structural morphologies - cluster blobs , walls and filaments - the practical implementation of the segmentation consists of a sequence of three stages . because curvature components are used as structural indicators , the blobs need to be eliminated before looking for filaments , after which the filaments have to be eliminated before looking for walls .",
    "this results in the mmf procedure following the sequence `` clusters @xmath74 filaments @xmath74 walls '' . at each of these three steps ,",
    "the regions and scales are identified at which the local matter distribution follows the corresponding eigenvalue signature .    in practice",
    ", the mmf defines a set of morphology masks , morphology response filters and morphology filters for each of the three different morphological components : clusters , filaments and walls .",
    "their form is dictated by the particular morphological feature they seek to extract , via the eigenvalues at each level in scale space and the criteria for each of the corresponding morphologies ( table  2 ) .",

    "the value of the thresholds @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 for clusters , filaments and walls is determined on the basis of the measured dependence of the structure detection rate as a function of the value of the morphology signal @xmath76 .",

    "this is not surprising , since most of the mass of the cluster is located in the dense inner regions of the cluster . on the other hand , the scatter between radius of hop and mmf clusters is large .",

    "the distance of the most distant particle from the center of mass is sensitive to small fluctuations in the perifery of the clusters .",

    "however , in general the shape of virialized clusters tend to depart from sphericity , which can be most clearly observed in computer simulations ( see e.g * ? ? ?",
    "massive clusters are often highly elongated in the direction of the filaments connected to them , and along which most merging clumps are moving in @xcite . in fact , the infall of matter along the filamentary transport channels amplifies the elongation and alignments of the clusters with respect to the filaments and neighbouring clusters @xcite . the strongest contribution to this effect",
    "is that by the merging of two or more clusters , which shares the highly anisotropic nature of the more gradual accretion of most of the matter .",
    "once all clusters are identified , the corresponding cluster particles are removed from the particle sample . the cluster - free particle distribution is subsequently analyzed for its filament population .      on the basis of the `` cluster - free '' particle distribution ,",
    "we compute the dtfe density field .",
    "this density field only contains structures associated with filaments and walls , and is used as input for the identification of filaments in the mmf pipeline .",
    "the 3d visualization allows us to appreciate the three - dimensional nature of the filaments , in particular also highlighting their connectivity .",

    "note that there are some small particles and clumps , which appear to be mostly isolated and bear no relation to the surrounding structures .",
    "these correspond to regions that have a spurious filamentary nature , and are near the resolution and filament detection limit of mmf .",
    "we discard these spurious identification from the filament mask .",
    "0.5truecm     filaments identified with the mmf are complex objects that pervade throughout the sample volume , connecting each of its regions .",
    "mmf follows the intrinsic scale of the real filaments , which feature a large range of lengths and widths .",
    "the corresponding filament particle distribution is far from homogeneous : along the filaments we find dense haloes as well as a pervasive medium of diffuse particles .",
    "it is clear that a description of such complex systems requires advanced methods of analysis which are sensitive to the anisotropic and multiscale nature of the matter distribution .",
    "the mmf is an example of such a specifically designed instrument .      after removing the particles located inside clusters and filaments we proceed to the last step in the morphological segmentation , the identification of walls in the density field .",
    "walls are the most tenuous coherent structures in the large - scale universe .",
    "their identification poses a major challenge @xcite , and their tenuous nature and complex topology and shapes makes them the most difficult morphology to characterize .",

    "the top panel shows the particles located within the walls , with the bottom panels depicting the corresponding walls by means of isosurfaces .",
    "the dtfe density field on the basis of the cluster and filament free particle sample contains only features of a planar nature , although it also contains various noisy features that can not be clearly identified with any of the three basic morphologies .    in general , walls identified with the mmf are far from smooth planar objects .",
    "they tend to have crumpled shapes with no obvious topology . because they are multiply connected objects , it is virtually impossible to isolate individual walls from the complex web of walls",
    ". evidently , mmf identifies the walls succesfully .",
    "however , as a result of their complex nature , we restrict ourselves to assessing their basic properties .",
    "in order to understand the role of clusters , filaments and walls in the shaping of the cosmic web it is crucial to determine their relative abundances in terms of volume and mass . such quantities may provide rough estimates of the dominance of one morphology with respect to the other in shaping the cosmic web and driving its overall dynamics .",
    "table  3 lists some basic characteristics for each of the morphological elements .",
    "these include an inventory of the cosmic web in terms of volume and mass content .",
    "the mass content of a particular morphology is measured by adding the total mass of the particles enclosed within the boundaries of that morphology .",
    "the fraction of the occupied volume is determined by adding the volume of all voxels enclosed within the morphological boundaries .",
    "the resulting cosmic inventory is summarized in the pie diagrams of fig .",
    "[ fig : cosmic_web_pie_diagram ] .",
    "the stark contrast between the volume and the mass share of the clusters , filaments and sheets is a direct manifestation of the large density differences between the different morphologies and a direct indication of the dynamical importance of these elements .",
    "the density contrast differences are also an indication for the different evolutionary stages in which they reside , as gravitational collapse proceeds faster as we go from @xmath84 walls @xmath74 filaments @xmath74 clusters .",
    "not surprisingly , clusters occupy the smallest volume fraction in the cosmic web , occupying only 0.38 % . despite this",
    ", they also represent a major share of the cosmic mass : 28% of the total mass resides within cluster regions .",
    "this not only makes them by far the densest objects of the megaparsec universe , but also the dynamically dominant component of the cosmic web ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the largest fraction of the mass in the universe , @xmath85 , resides in filaments , which occupy around @xmath86 of the total volume .",
    "although their density is lower than that of clusters , they represent the most salient component of the cosmic web via their function as the all - pervasive bridges between all structural features in the megaparsec universe .",
    "walls contain a substantially smaller fraction of the mass , @xmath87 .",
    "they also occupy a relatively small volume , at @xmath88 even less than that occupied by filaments .",
    "it certainly means that walls have been relatively unimportant in the recent formation history of the cosmic web .",
    "it is instructive to compare the present - day morphological inventory with that in the primordial density field . on the basis of the ( tidal ) deformation tensor distribution in the primordial gaussian field",
    ", @xcite showed that in the _ linear regime _ 92 % of the mass will collapse into walls , filaments or clusters .",
    "filaments and walls would each take @xmath89 of the share , clusters @xmath90 , while the remaining 8 @xmath91 would correspond to underdense voids . while we may already expect that this direct link between primordial deformation tensor and morphology is too simplistic , it is the subsequent quasi - linear and nonlinear evolution which changes these numbers substantially .",
    "the mmf is a density field based criterion , and performs better as the density field becomes more prominent and non - linear : it selects only those regions with a clear morphology and contrast .",
    "following the same deformation tensor criteria with respect to the primordial density field , @xcite showed that filaments will be much more prominent in the high density regions , which tend to develop faster in the subsequent nonlinear evolution .",
    "walls are more biased to lower density regions , and at all times will therefore occur less prominent than filaments .",
    "the mmf sensitivities will therefore be naturally biased towards the filaments and clusters in the mass distribution .",
    "moreover , mmf is less likely to properly identify the outer infall regions of clusters , filaments and walls and instead tends to relegate part of these to the field as they have not yet emerged as fully developed structures . here ,",
    "for simplicity , we identify these field regions with the larger low density voids .      the differences in mass and volume content derived for each morphology correspond to different density ranges .",
    "it is often assumed that these elements mark out a unique density regime , with no overlapping values .",
    "this assumption is the basis for the use of overdensity as one of the most widely used criteria to identify clusters @xcite and filaments @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : density_cum ] shows the cumulative and probability distributions of the overdensity @xmath92 within the regions identified as clusters , filaments , walls and fied .",
    "the lower panel shows that each morphology occupies a characteristic range in density .",
    "* clusters are the densest objects , with a median overdensity of @xmath93 and a mean overdensity of @xmath94 .",
    "the range of overdensities extends to more than @xmath95 and even @xmath96 within the large virialized clusters . *",
    "filaments and walls have medium overdensities , with mean overdensity of @xmath97 for filaments and @xmath98 for walls and a median overdensity of @xmath99 and @xmath100 respectively . * the field should be mostly identified with the most underdense void regions . on average , the void regions correspond to underdensities of @xmath101 .",
    "the density values for filaments and walls partially coincide with the density range expected for collapsed objects , since they concern values @xmath102 at which spherical objects turn around into collapse . however , in particular for walls a major fraction of the enclosed space has a substantially lower density .",
    "to a large extent this concerns the lower density in the outer realms which surround the dense inner regions of clusters , filaments and walls .",
    "there is also a bias towards low densities in structures identified with the mmf as a result of the morphology threshold criteria used by mmf to separate real and noisy structures ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : threshold ] ) .",
    "the considerable level of overlap in density between the various morphologies also means that a pure density criterion for structural identification does not provide an accurate description of reality .",
    "a morphological segmentation in terms of density alone would require at least a non - overlapping low - density tail .",
    "however , the fact that this does not seem to be the case implies there to be a substantial contamination with other morphological elements if one would resort to a pure density - based criterion : a ( global ) density threshold would be a poor discriminator of morphology . even when each morphology can be associated with a specific density range , in general an additional , more sophisticated characterization is required .",
    "the use of the mmf method to disentangle the cosmic web into its basic morphologies , independent of their density contrast , is clearly justified by the results presented in figure  [ fig : density_cum ] .",
    "however , we do have to take care of the fact that the mmf density estimates of filaments and walls tend to be systematically lower than the actual values ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : threshold ] ) .",
    "without doubt , the most salient features of the cosmic web are the large filamentary networks , which are interconnected across tens and even hundred of megaparsecs . in this section",
    "we focus specifically on the filaments identified with the mmf and study their general properties such as length , density profile , connectivity , etc .",
    "filaments and walls have a complex topology .",
    "their general shape may be far from idealized lines and planes .",
    "properties such as direction , density profiles , extent and other measures derived from these quantities are difficult to interpret or meaningless without a proper reference point .",
    "we address this problem by defining their  heartline \" in a similar way as the center of mass in spherical clusters is used as reference point .",
    "we define the one and two - dimensional counterparts for filaments and walls .",
    "they will be referred as the  spine \" of filaments and the  plane \" of walls .    in order to infer the idealized lines and planes from the complex filaments and walls we performed an iterative algorithm that compresses structures along their perpendicular direction ( normal to the spine of the filament or the plane of the wall ) by moving each particle ( or halo ) to the center of mass inside a spherical window centered on the particle until its position converges .",
    "the movement of the particles is restricted along the perpendicular direction to the spine of the filament or the plane of the wall ( see appendix  [ sec : compression ] for details ) .",
    "this procedure _ enhances _ filaments and walls compressing them closer to idealized structures : filaments become one - dimensional lines while walls are compressed to nearly planar two - dimensional planes ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : slice_filas_compress_zoom ] ) .    in the determination of spines and planes we based ourselves on dark matter haloes instead of particles .",
    "spines and planes derived from the raw dark matter particles tend to cross the centers of large haloes since they contain most of the matter in the neighborhood .",
    "this gives a similar result as with the use of haloes .",
    "however , in computing the density profile the difference between particles and haloes can become important .",
    "the density profile is dominated at small scales by large haloes , giving the false impression of highly dense cuspy cores or even worst , producing several `` cores '' of a single filament @xcite .",

    "the filamentary network permeates all regions of space , even the very underdense voids .",
    "one important aspect of the filamentary network is its cellular nature @xcite which defines a multiscale system marked by structures over a range of scales @xcite .",

    "however , such massive systems are marked by a substantial degree of substructure , containing numerous clusters and a filigree of small - scale filaments .    in general , large haloes",
    "dominate the density profile .",
    "this manifests itself in a cuspy profile centered at the spine of the host filaments , and even occasionally involving several peaks near the centre . following this observation",
    ", we use haloes instead of dark matter particles , thereby avoiding contamination of the radial profile at small scales",
    ". the density profiles of the filaments are determined by counting the _ enclosed number of haloes _ , weighted by their mass , in bins of increasing radial distance from the spine of the filament .",
    "the radial distance of a halo with respect to the spine of its host filament is defined as the displacement of a halo _ before _ and _ after _",
    "we apply the compression algorithm described in section [ sec : filament_compression ] ( see appendix  [ sec : compression ] for details ) . to enable the mutual comparison of the density profiles of all filaments , they are all scaled to a value @xmath125 at the center of each filament .",

    "a similar analysis for walls reveals that they have less well defined boundaries with widths ranging between 5 - 8 @xmath6 .",

    "for a one - dimensional entity like a filament this implies that no more mass is attached to the filament at larger radii .",

    "the profile slope transition at around @xmath129 , provides a simple criterion for defining the width of filaments .",
    "the fact that there appears to be only a small variation in this width ( see fig .  [",

    ", we show the density profile for 15 individual filaments in the right panel of the same figure .",
    "while the individual profiles differ , their variation is restricted to a rather small range .",
    "we also find some variation in the maximum extent of filaments , which confirms the impression obtained from the observed cosmic web and had already been noticed in previous studies @xcite .",

    ", filaments are the transport channels along which clusters accrete mass ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "massive clusters are formed at the sites of rare high density peaks in the primordial matter distribution @xcite , and dominate the dynamical evolution of the cosmic matter distribution . particularly in the high - density areas ,",
    "the overwhelming coherent gravitational tidal forces between two cluster peaks are responsible for anisotropic collapse of the surrounding matter towards elongated filaments @xcite .",
    "the strength of the filamentary bridges is expected to depend on the mass of the generating cluster , their mutual distance and their mutual orientation @xcite .",
    "this has been confirmed by numerous numerical simulations ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "[ sec : length_of_filaments ] . to this end",
    ", we applied the following criteria :    * a filament is connected to a cluster if it has at least one halo within a sphere of radius 3 @xmath6 from the center of the cluster . *",
    "only clusters with @xmath117 m@xmath3 h@xmath4 were considered in our analysis .",
    "figure  [ fig : cluster_n_filament_mass ] suggests an almost linear relation between the mass of a cluster and the number of filaments that are connected to the cluster , although the dispersion around the relation is rather large .",
    "the most massive clusters , the ones with a mass in excess of @xmath132 m@xmath3 h@xmath4 may form a node connecting to 5 or even 6 different filaments .",
    "low mass clusters with a mass @xmath133 m@xmath3 h@xmath4 , on the other hand , tend to have rather simple connections of 2 and not more than 3 filaments .",
    "the figure suggests that some clusters may even have only one filament connected to them .",
    "however , this is not observed in the cosmic web , and would be difficult to justify from a physical point of view .",
    "it is mainly the result of the method used to assign filaments to clusters , which may in some situations miss a few faint filaments which would be connected to these low - mass clusters .",
    "the large dispersion in figure  [ fig : cluster_n_filament_mass ] reflects the complexity of the cosmic web .",
    "the final matter configuration in the neighborhood of a cluster depends not only on its mass but also on the geometrical configuration of the surrounding clusters @xcite .",
    "other studies have found a similar relation based on intracluster filaments found in n - body simulations @xcite and visually identified filament - cluster connections from the 2df galaxy survey @xcite .",
    "we provide a qualitative and quantitative description of the cosmic web in terms of its morphological constituents .",
    "we focused on filaments , to a lesser degree on walls .",
    "the basis for this work is a large n - body simulation of a @xmath0cdm cosmology with dark matter particles .",
    "the morphological segmentation was done with the multiscale morphology filter .    1 .",
    "the mass content , volume content and mean density of the cosmic web is quantitatively summarized in table  4 .",
    "each morphology of the cosmic web has a characteristic density . the distribution of densities however , has a large overlap .",
    "density alone can give an indication of the morphology but it can not be used to unambiguously segment the cosmic web into its morphological constituents .",
    "we offer a qualitative classification of filaments based on their visual properties in four types : _ line _ , _ star _ , _ grid _ and _ complex_. 4 .",
    "the density profile of filaments indicates that their typical radial extent is of the order of 2 @xmath6 , although there are significant variations between filaments . in their interior , filaments have a power - law density profile with slope @xmath7 , corresponding to an isothermal density profile .",
    "we find a relation between the mass of a cluster and the number of filaments it has connected .",
    "more massive clusters have more filaments in average . clusters with a mass of @xmath120 m@xmath3 h@xmath4 have on average two connecting filaments while clusters with mass of @xmath134 m@xmath3 h@xmath4 have on average five connecting filaments .    having analyzed and described the structure of the filamentary network , in the subsequent paper we will adress the velocity flows and the dynamics of the network and of individual clusters .",
    "also , we plan to experiment with the mmf detection technique , and instead of adressing the multiscale character of the density field develop a version based on the dynamically more relevant gravitational potential field .    in a related study @xcite ,",
    "we have applied the mmf to detecting filaments in the sdss galaxy redshift survey and identified edge - on galaxies within their realm .",
    "this allowed us to adress and answer the question whether there are significant alignments of galaxy spins along the spine of the sdss filaments .",
    "this is expected following the tidal torque theory for galaxy angular momentum generation .",
    "mmf indeed allowed us to identify a subset of galaxies and filaments conforming to a significant alignment .",
    "the application of mmf to real galaxy surveys introduces a few important additional challenges .",
    "one aspect concerns the survey volume selection .",
    "while a volume - limited survey would guarantee an ideal homogeneous coverage , in practice it involves a severe reduction of spatial resolution and hence the feasibility of identifing crucial aspects of the anisotropic features in the cosmic web . for magnitude - limited galaxy redshift surveys , the dtfe density field reconstruction enables a correction for the diminishing sampling density at higher density .",
    "nonetheless , an appropriate mmf web analysis will still be restricted to the more densely sampled regions out to the peak of the radial survey selection function .",
    "a recent meticulous analysis by @xcite has assured us that our web analysis tool box can be succesfully tuned towards controlling this issue .",
    "an additional artefact that may severely affect the identification of filaments is the imprint of redshift distortions .",
    "the large peculiar motions in and around the virialized cluster cores generate artificial radially directed elongated features , better known as the _ fingers of god_. in practice , we remove all filaments within a limiting angle @xmath135 around the line of sight .",
    "@xcite show that this succesfully recovers a statistically proper filament distribution .",
    "large scale cosmic flows are known to enhance the contrast of anisotropic filamentary features ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a proper correction for this would at least demand a densely sampled environment so that one may model the corresponding force field",
    "this is work in progress and has not yet been implemented in our tool box .",

    "in order to enhance filaments and walls and to morph them closer to idealized lines and planes , we developed a _ compression _ algorithm .",
    "the algorithm displaces particles in the direction of increasing density , towards the spine of the filaments or the planes that define the walls .",
    "the algorithm can be applied to particles as well as to haloes , after weighing them by their mass .",
    "the compression procedure exploits the information produced by the mmf .",
    "not only does it identify the filaments and walls in the cosmic web , but also their local direction represented by the eigenvectors of the hessian matrix ( see @xcite and sect .",
    "[ sec : mmf ] ) .",
    "the smallest eigenvector of the hessian matrix traces the local direction of a filament , while the largest eigenvector locally defines the normal to the wall .",
    "this information is exploited to iteratively displace particles to the local center of mass within a given radius .",
    "it is a widely used method for computing the center of mass in spherical or semi - spherical haloes @xcite .",
    "we start by defining the _ heartline _ of filaments and walls in a similar way similar to determining the center of mass in spherical haloes .",
    "this heartline is used as reference point .",
    "the one and two - dimensional heartlines for filaments and walls are referred as the _ spine _ of the filaments and the _ plane _ of the walls .",
    "our compression algorithm involves the crucial constraint that the displacement of particles to the center of mass follows the direction _",
    "perpendicular to the filament or wall_. as a result , this process transforms thick structures into thin lines or planes without affecting their length .    in summary ,",
    "the algorithm has the following steps ( for simplicity we only refer to particles , haloes will be treated equivalently ) :    1 .   for each particle",
    "@xmath136 we find all neighbours inside a top - hat window of a given radius @xmath137 , centered at the particle s position @xmath138 .",
    "the tophat radius should be large enough to enclose the filament or wall in order to minimize the number of iterations needed .",
    "the center of mass @xmath139 of the particles inside the tophat window is computed , along with the vector defined by the particle s position and the center of mass @xmath139 .",
    "the particle is displaced to the center of mass _ along the perpendicular direction of the filament / wall _ : @xmath140 where @xmath141 is the vector indicating the direction of the spine of the filament or the normal to the plane of the wall .",
    "the angle @xmath142 is the angle between the vector @xmath141 and the center of mass @xmath143 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : compress_fil_diag ] ) .",
    "+ the eigenvectors @xmath141 are computed from the hessian matrix smoothed at the characteristic scale of filaments , @xmath144 ( see sect .",
    "[ sec : density_profiles ] ) .",
    "4 .   after having performed the process for all particles , we compute the dispersion between the `` original '' and `` compressed '' positions .",
    "we repeat the complete process until the dispersion between consecutive iterations changes by a given factor , or until the total dispersion is less than a prescribed value .",
    "this value specifies the convergence of the method .",
    "the compression algorithm is rather insensitive to the size of the tophat window , which may be in the range of @xmath145 for filaments and @xmath146 for walls .",
    "the lower limit depends on the mean interparticle separation , because there must be at least two particles inside the search window in order to displace the particle .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath147 depends on how close the filaments and walls are to each other .",
    "if we would chose for a larger radius , particles from adjacent structures would be included which would invalidate the compression procedure .",
    "we continue the compression algorithm recursively until the dispersion between consecutive compressed positions is less than 0.25 @xmath6 .",
    "it is important to note that in the compression algorithm we only account for particles contained in the morphological population under consideration .",
    "the determination of the length of filaments involves two steps .",
    "the first is the compression of the filaments , following the procedure outlined in the appendix  [ sec : compression ] .",
    "the second step consists of fitting a polynomial to the particle or halo distribution along the filament .    by fitting to a polynomial",
    ", we smooth the small - scale variations that may remain following the compression procedure .",
    "if we would not include this step , and instead chose to add the segments of the mimimum spanning tree defined by the particle distribution , we would end up with a filament whose size would be larger than strictly representative .    as a compromise between simplicity and the ability to follow intricate and complex filament shapes , we chose to use polynomials of @xmath148 order .",
    "a visual inspection of several filaments assured us that the @xmath148 order polynomials are indeed sufficient for modelling even the most intricate filaments . they manage to follow each change in direction .",
    "the positions @xmath149 of each of the particles / haloes @xmath136 belonging to a filament are fitted to a polynomial of the form @xmath150 where the parameter @xmath151 is defined as the distance from an arbitrary location ( @xmath152 ) : @xmath153 in practice we chose a set of values for @xmath154 , usually the corners of the simulation box , and select the one that gives the best fit according to the criterion of having the smallest mean square difference , @xmath155 if @xmath156 turns out to be larger than a given threshold , whose value is determined by means of experimentation , we reject the fit .    .",
    "haloes are represented as large black dots .",
    "the closest halo to points @xmath157 and @xmath158 is halo 1 . at point @xmath159 the closest halo changes to halo 2 indicating that the fitting curve is `` inside '' the filament.,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    one remaining technical difficulty is the determination of the extreme points of the filament for the fitting curve",
    "this is a non - trivial task , and if not considered properly may lead to wrong length determinations .",
    "we follow a simple but effective method to identify the extremes :    * the polynomial curve is closely sampled and distances to all the particles in the filament are computed starting from one extreme of the fitted curve . * for each point in the fitting curve the closest halo is identified . *",
    "we identify the point in the fitting curve at which the identity of the closest halo changes .",
    "this indicates that the fitting curve is no longer `` outside '' the filament but `` inside '' it ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : filaments_compressed_fit ] ) . *",
    "we repeat the procedure for the second extreme of the fitting curve ."
