    "consistent with its probable origin by stripped stars from all types of cluster galaxies , population synthesis shows that the icl contains large numbers of old , relatively metal - rich stars such as are in giant ellipticals , but also a significant presence of younger , more metal - poor stars from smaller galaxies @xcite .",
    "assessing the true fraction of the icl component relative to the individual galaxies is a continuing and difficult issue since it requires careful separation of the icl profile from the giant galaxies in the cluster , but is almost certainly in the range 10 - 50% for rich clusters and even groups @xcite .",
    "the growth of the icl is an ongoing process with much of it happening since redshift @xmath3 @xcite , so the total luminosity in the icl and its degree of substructure ( clumps and tidal streams ) are indicative of the dynamical evolutionary state of the cluster .    for nearby cluster environments ( virgo , fornax , coma )",
    "the icl has been probed through resolution into individual stars including red - giant stars @xcite , planetary nebula @xcite , and even novae and supernovae @xcite .",
    "but another prominent tracer of the icl that has so far been underutilized is the globular cluster ( gc ) population , which accompanies all types of old stellar populations in galaxies .",

    "however , ngc 1275 appears to be the closest to the dynamical center of perseus , based on its projected location virtually at the center of the hot x - ray halo , its radial velocity ( 5264 km s@xmath7 ) close to the cluster mean , and the dramatic presence of large gas inflow revealed in its extensive gas and dust network of filaments .",
    "although ngc 1272 is also projected fairly close to cluster center , its radial velocity ( 3815 km s@xmath7 ) is much further from the cluster mean , and its integrated - light profile is smooth and featureless at all radii .    in this paper , we take advantage of archival hst images near the center of perseus to search specifically for igcs as a tracer for the icl .",
