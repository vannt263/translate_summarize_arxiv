    "oxygen is an important impurity in silicon , being present in concentrations of @xmath5 @xmath1 in czochralski silicon ( cz - si ) , which is used for the vast majority of integrated circuits ( ics ) and @xmath6 of solar cells .",
    "it is also present in lower , but still significant , concentrations ( of order @xmath7 @xmath1 ) in cast multicrystalline silicon ( mc - si ) used equally if not more widely for modern silicon photovoltaics .",
    "the presence of oxygen has substantial beneficial as well as detrimental effects on silicon s material properties and so has been the subject of much research ( see @xcite ) .",
    "perhaps most importantly , oxide precipitates ( ops ) can be intentionally created in inactive regions of wafers to act as sinks for detrimental metallic impurities in a process known as _ internal gettering _",
    "oxygen can also improve high temperature mechanical strength by atomic decoration of dislocations @xcite and by precipitation in the bulk @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , oxygen - containing defects in various guises also act as recombination centers , including thermal donor defects @xcite , boron - oxygen complexes @xcite , and ops @xcite .",
    "ops can also form unintentionally in mc - si during ingot cooling @xcite , and can limit the efficiency of modern silicon photovoltaic devices @xcite .",
    "they undergo a morphological transformation during growth @xcite , which is known to have implications for both , internal gettering @xcite and recombination of minority carriers @xcite .",
    "the precipitates initially exist in an unstrained state ( sometimes referred to as `` ninja particles '' ) , but after a certain threshold growth time ( dependent on the density of nucleation sites ) they change morphology into a strained state , which coincides with the transition from ineffective to totally effective gettering @xcite .",
    "they then continue to grow in size and eventually begin to become surrounded by complex dislocation structures and even stacking faults @xcite .",
    "recombination at ops has recently been found to depend upon their strain state and whether the precipitates are surrounded by other extended defects @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the rate of recombination in samples dominated by strained precipitates is dependent upon precipitate density , rather than size @xcite . as the number of corners of the strained platelets is invariant with size",
    ", these discontinuities have been suggested to play a role in the recombination process @xcite .",
    "the photoconductance methods @xcite used in this previous study @xcite do , however , not allow the microscopic nature of the specific defect(s ) responsible for recombination to be clearly determined .",
    "+ in this paper we present the results of experiments using electrically detected magnetic resonance ( edmr ) , which aim to better understand the recombination mechanism associated with ops .",
    "edmr is a sensitive spectroscopic technique providing a much higher sensitivity than conventional electron paramagnetic resonance ( epr ) for bulk samples , which has been used extensively to study defects and impurities in silicon @xcite .",
    "the sensitivity of edmr is typically @xmath8 times higher than for conventional epr , and has been demonstrated to approach the few to single spin regime for nanodevices with an optimised sample geometry @xcite . in edmr , the sample is placed in a static magnetic field and irradiated in a microwave cavity .",
    "the epr - induced change in spin population is detected through the ( resonant ) change of the device conductivity .",
    "hence , only electrically active defects involved in electron transport , such as recombination centers , are observed in edmr . as opposed to epr , parasitic signals , which do not determine electron transport ,",
    "are consequently not observed .",
    "this is why edmr has been particularly successful in the spectroscopic characterization of e.g. electron transport in silicon field - effect transistors @xcite as well as defects and impurities in modern silicon photovoltaic devices @xcite .",
    "magnetic resonance techniques have also been used previously to study recombination at ops @xcite , showing , for example , that silicon dangling bonds at the silicon - silicon dioxide interface ( si / sio@xmath9 ) play a major role in recombination at ops @xcite . in our work",
    "we study materials possessing a wide range of strained precipitate densities , which we relate to spin - dependent recombination times extracted from the edmr data .",
    "we also study intentionally iron - contaminated samples to improve understanding of the role of interstitial iron ( fe ) in the recombination process .",

    "determination of this lifetime assumes that the photocurrent through the device is determined by the time - dependent density of photo - excited electrons @xmath14 , which is described by the rate equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the generation rate , and @xmath17 the recombination rate modulated around its average value @xmath18 with modulation frequency @xmath19 and modulation amplitude @xmath20 .",
    "equation [ diffeqn ] can be solved by making a first - order approximation , i.e. @xmath21 , with the ansatz @xmath22 .",
    "the solution then reads @xmath23 where @xmath24 is the electronic recombination time associated with the particular recombination center , and @xmath25 the average carrier density .",
    "the recombination time @xmath26 can be determined by measuring the absolute value of the edmr signal amplitude @xmath27 as a function of modulation frequency and fitting it to @xmath28 the edmr signal approaches its maximum value @xmath29 for @xmath30 , and decreases proportionally to @xmath31 for @xmath32 . this technique has been successfully applied previously to study e.g. spin - dependent trapping at trivalent silicon centers in silicon bicrystals@xcite as well as spin - dependent recombination at the silicon surface@xcite and p@xmath3 dangling bonds@xcite .",
    "we note that the modulation frequency has to be slow compared to the spin - lattice relaxation time @xmath33 of the spins in order to comply with the slow - adiabatic passage condition and avoid distortion of the edmr signal due to passage effects@xcite , which have not been observed in our experiments .     as a function of modulation frequency @xmath19 for the precipitate - free sample ( @xmath34 , black ) and three exemplary samples with a low ( @xmath35 , red ) , medium ( @xmath35 , green ) , and high concentration of ops ( @xmath35 , blue ) .",

    "we employed this technique to measure the electronic recombination time of p@xmath3 and p@xmath4 dangling bonds in cz - si without and with ops with different concentrations @xcite .",
    "our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] for a set of four exemplary samples using a modulation frequency of @xmath36  khz , well below the expected cutoff frequency of our experimental setup @xmath37  khz .",
    "the electronic recombination time decreases with an increasing concentration of ops , and has a maximum value @xmath38s in the precipitate - free sample .",
    "similar values have been observed for p@xmath3 centers at the ( 100 ) si / sio@xmath9 surface with this technique before@xcite .",
    "previous photoconductance measurements on surface passivated cz - si with ops have shown that the reciprocal of the recombination time @xmath39 increases with increasing op concentration [ op ] linearly according to @xmath40[op ] , where @xmath41 denotes the capture coefficient @xcite .",
    "our measurements reveal a similar relationship but with a non - zero y - axis intercept as shown in fig .",
    "our data is best fit to @xmath40[op]@xmath42 with @xmath43@xmath44s@xmath45 and @xmath46s@xmath45 , which corresponds to a recombination time @xmath47s .",
    "the recombination time of dangling bonds in the iron - contaminated sample was measured to @xmath48s , the lifetime of the iron - boron pair to @xmath49s , which is significantly shorter than most of the recombination times observed in our samples .     as a function of strained op concentration [ op ] .",
    "the linear fit ( solid line , red ) to the data ( @xmath35 ) yields a slope of @xmath50@xmath44s@xmath45 and a y - axis intercept of @xmath46s@xmath45 ( dashed line , black ) . ]",
    "the sign of each edmr signal shown in fig .  [ fig2 ] was determined by measuring the dc change in sample resistivity on and off resonance .",
    "this measurement confirms that the sample resistivity increases upon resonance , i.e.  @xmath51 , which corresponds to a resonant decrease of the photocurrent . at the same time",
    ", the sample resistivity has been observed to increase with decreasing temperature for all samples , i.e. @xmath52 .",
    "hence , bolometric heating can be ruled out as the predominant edmr mechanism as that would produce an edmr signal , which follows the sign of @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , a resonance line associated with conduction band electrons has not been observed in our experiments .",
    "we therefore interpret our results in terms of spin - dependent recombination @xcite of photo - excited electron - hole pairs from the urbach tails of the conduction band @xcite through the recombination centers compiled in table  [ tab2 ] .",
    "the two lower - field features of the edmr spectra shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] have been explained in terms of the feb pair and the fe center .",
    "the observation of the feb pair is particularly interesting as this impurity has , to our best knowledge , not been observed in edmr before .",
    "owing to its comparatively short electronic recombination time @xmath54s , our results demonstrate that the feb pair is a very active recombination center and contributes to spin - dependent recombination in cz - si with ops . the resonance line associated with interstitial fe",
    "was only observed in the iron - contaminated sample and seems to be detectable in our experimental setup if the concentration of dissolved iron exceeds a certain threshold only .",
    "neither the interstitial fe nor feb pair were observed in any sample under standard epr measurements carried out prior each edmr experiment .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that the maximum bulk iron concentration in our samples ( 1.2 @xmath55@xmath1 , measured by photodissociation of feb pairs ) is an order of magnitude lower than the sensitivity of our epr spectrometer .",
    "the most intense features of the emdr spectra ( around @xmath56 ) have been explained in terms of p@xmath3 and p@xmath4 dangling bonds .",
    "while p@xmath3 dangling bonds have been observed in edmr before , there is no consensus in the literature over whether or not the p@xmath4 defect is electrically active @xcite .",
    "our results shown in fig .  [ fig4 ] demonstrate , however , that p@xmath4 is an electrically active defect and contributes to spin - dependent recombination . the recombination time",
    "( through both p@xmath3 and p@xmath4 ) is measured to be @xmath38s in the precipitate - free sample ( fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) , coinciding well with the lifetime @xmath47s extracted from the y - axis intercept @xmath57 of the linear fit in fig .",
    "this concurrence suggests that photo - excited electron - hole pairs recombine through dangling bonds at the surface as well as through dangling bonds at the ops .",
    "the first recombination channel gives rise to the finite y - axis intercept , the latter to the finite capture coefficient @xmath43@xmath44s@xmath45 .",
    "the results obtained in this edmr study are consistent with those in a recent study of recombination at ops by photoconductance measurements @xcite .",
    "this other study also found an approximately linear correlation between reciprocal lifetime and strained op density , but in this case the intercept of the plot analogous to fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] was very close to the origin .",
    "the difference can be explained by the high quality surface passivation substantially reducing recombination at surface - related p@xmath3 and p@xmath4 centers .",
    "it is interesting to note that the size of the precipitate , as governed mainly by the growth time , does not seem to make a substantial contribution to the rate of recombination .",
    "the previous study @xcite tentatively suggested the size independence could be explained by recombination at the precipitate corners ( see figs .",
    "[ fig1 ] ( a ) to ( d ) ) .",
    "the edmr results presented here show a linear dependence of the recombination rate due to p@xmath3 and p@xmath4 dangling bonds .",
    "this is why we speculate that p@xmath3 and p@xmath4 dangling bonds form at the corners of the strained precipitates .",
    "in summary , we have clarified the microscopic mechanism giving rise to the edmr effect in cz - si with ops .",
    "spin - dependent recombination of photo - excited electron - hole pairs has been identified as the predominant edmr mechanism .",
    "we observe two coexisting defect configurations of dissolved iron ( interstitial fe and feb ) and show that both of them do contribute to spin - dependent recombination .",
    "we have demonstrated that both , the electronic recombination time and the capture coefficient can be measured with edmr by changing the modulation frequency .",
    "our recombination time analysis on precipitate - free and on a series of precipitate containing samples with different concentrations of ops has shown in particular that photo - excited electron - hole pairs recombine through p@xmath3 and p@xmath4 dangling bonds formed at the sample surface and ops . the recombination rate associated with ops",
    "was found to increase approximately linearly with an increasing density of strained ops with the capture coefficient @xmath43@xmath44s@xmath45 .",
    "further insight into the recombination process and its dynamics may be obtained from pulsed- @xcite and high - field edmr @xcite experiments , which will allow us to determine any coupling between the different centers and to study spin - dependent recombination with an enhanced spectral resolution , respectively .",
