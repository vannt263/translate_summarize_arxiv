    "the study of the existence and complexity of universal circuits for quantum circuit classes provides insight into the computational strength of such circuits , as well as their limits .",
    "there is both a theoretical and a practical aspect to this study .",
    "the existence of a universal circuit family for a complexity class defined by resource bounds ( depth , size , gate width , etc . ) provides an upper bound on the resources needed to compute any circuit in that class .",
    "it also opens up possibilities for proving lower bounds on the hard languages in the class , as such bounds would follow from a lower bound proof for the language computed by a universal circuit family for the circuit class .",
    "more precisely , the specific , efficient construction of a universal circuit for a class of circuits yields , for a fixed input size , a single circuit which can be used to carry out the computation of every circuit ( with that same input size ) in that family , basically a chip or processor for that class of circuits .",
    "the more efficient the construction of the universal circuit , the smaller the processor for that class .",
    "furthermore , the universal circuit is in a sense a compiler for all possible computations of all circuits in this family .",
    "it can be used to efficiently program all possible computations capable of being carried out by circuits in this circuit class , and in doing so automatically acts as a general purpose simulator and with as little loss of efficiency as is possible .    in the case of quantum circuits",
    "there are particular issues relating to the requirements that computations must be clean and reversible which come into play , and to an extent complicate the classical methods .",
    "still much of our motivation for this work originates with classical results due to cook , valiant , and others @xcite .",
    "cook and hoover considered depth universality and described a depth - universal uniform circuit family for circuits of depth @xmath0 .",
    "valiant studied size universality and showed how to construct universal circuits of size @xmath1 to simulate any circuit of size @xmath2 .",

    "as in the classical case , we also want our universal circuits to be _ efficient _ in various ways .",
    "for one , we restrict them to using the same gate family as the circuits they simulate .",

    "note that the results for the two circuit families are independent , because it is not known whether @xmath5-qubit toffoli gates can be implemented exactly in constant depth using single - qubit gates and fanout gates , although they can be approximated this way @xcite",
    ".    it would be nice to find depth - universal circuits over families of bounded - width gates such as @xmath29 .",
    "depth - universal circuits with bounded - width gates , if they exist , must have depth @xmath0 and thus can only depth - efficiently simulate circuits with depth @xmath0 .",
    "this can be easily seen as follows : suppose all you wanted was a universal circuit @xmath6 for depth-1 circuits on @xmath5 qubits that use cnot gates _",
    "only_. since any pair of the @xmath5 qubits could potentially be connected with a cnot gate , that pair must be connected somehow ( indirectly perhaps ) within the circuit @xmath6 .",

    "he managed to create universal graphs for different types of circuits and showed how to construct a @xmath37-size and @xmath38-depth universal circuit .",
    "he also showed that his constructions have size within a constant multiplicative factor of the information theoretic lower bound .    for quantum circuits ,",
    "nielsen and chuang ( in @xcite ) considered the problem of building generic universal circuits , or _",
    "programmable universal gate arrays _ as they call them .",
    "their universal circuits work on two quantum registers , a data register and a program register . they do not consider any size or depth bound on the circuits and show that simulating every possible unitary operation requires completely orthogonal programs in the program register .",
    "since there are infinitely many possible unitary operations , any universal circuit would require an infinite number of qubits in the program register .",
    "this shows that it is not possible to have a generic universal circuit which works for all circuits of a certain input length .",
    "however they showed that it is possible to construct an extremely weak type of probabilistic universal circuit with size linear in the number of inputs to the simulated circuit .",
    "sousa and ramos considered a similar problem of creating a universal quantum circuit to simulate any quantum gate  @xcite .",
    "they construct a basic building block which can be used to implement any single - qubit or cnot gate on @xmath5 qubits by switching certain gates on and off .",

    "we will also need some additional gates , which we now motivate .",
    "the depth - universal circuits we construct require the ability to feed the output of a single gate to many other gates . while this operation , commonly known as fanout , is common in classical circuits , copying an arbitrary quantum state unitarily is not possible in quantum circuits due to the no - cloning theorem @xcite .",
    "it turns out that we can construct our circuits using a classical notion of fanout operation , defined as the _ fanout gate _",

    "we reserve the term `` toffoli gate '' to refer to the ( standard ) toffoli gate @xmath46 , which is defined on three qubits .",
    "in addition to the fanout gate , our construction requires us to use controlled versions of the gates used in the simulated circuit . for most of the commonly used basis sets of gates ( e.g. , toffoli gate , hadamard gate , and phase gate @xmath47 ) ,",

    "we can implement the phase gate @xmath47 as @xmath54 , and since @xmath55 , we can implement @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    a _ generalized @xmath58 gate _ , which we will hereafter refer to simply as a _ @xmath58 gate _",
    ", is an extension of the single - qubit pauli @xmath58 gate ( @xmath59 ) to multiple qubits : @xmath60 a @xmath58 gate can be constructed easily ( in constant depth and size ) from a single unbounded toffoli gate ( and vice versa ) by conjugating the target qubit of the unbounded toffoli gate with @xmath22 gates ( i.e. , placing @xmath22 on both sides of the toffoli gate on its target qubit ) .",
