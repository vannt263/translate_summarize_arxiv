    "previous parameter determinations , such as  @xcite , have had to rely on analytical approximations for rapid calculations of the cmb power spectrum in the closed region , since the current state of the art codes , such as the widely - used cmbfast  @xcite , do not yet support closed models .    in this _ letter _ we describe a numerical implementation of the linearized equations of the 1 + 3 covariant approach to cmb anisotropies  @xcite in almost - friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) models with open , flat , and closed background geometries .",

    "this geometric effect shifts power in the cmb spectra to smaller @xmath40 .",
    "since cmbfast  only computes the power spectra at a few values of @xmath40 , we adjust the @xmath40-sampling according to the the curvature to maintain accurate interpolation in all cases .    for the line of sight integral over sources ,",

    "we assume that the development angle @xmath41 satisfies @xmath42 , where @xmath43 and @xmath44 is the conformal age of the universe .",

    "it is important to maintain numerical stability in the differential equations for the dependent variables .",
    "this is especially true for scalar perturbations with isocurvature initial conditions , where a poor choice of dependent variables can lead to large violations of the einstein constraint equations unless the initial conditions are specified to exquisite accuracy .",
    "( this problem is particularly acute in the newtonian gauge , e.g.  @xcite . )",
    "we choose to work in a frame in which @xmath3 coincides with the 4-velocity of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) . for scalar perturbations , we determine the perturbations to the geometry by evolving the projected gradient of the 3-curvature on hypersurfaces orthogonal to @xmath3 , which gives good numerical stability for all initial conditions .",
    "( with this choice of dependent variables , our equation set is equivalent to a subset of the widely - used synchronous equations , gauge - fixed to the cdm . )",
    "we allow for adiabatic and two types of isocurvature initial conditions for scalar perturbations .",
