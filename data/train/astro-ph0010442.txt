    "in this letter , we report a discovery of the third largest radio galaxy in the universe . known from years , the record holder radio galaxy 3c236 with the linear extent of 5.65 mpc ( if @xmath1 km  s@xmath2  mpc@xmath2 and @xmath3 which we assume hereafter ) was mapped with the wsrt over 20 years ago ( cf .",
    "willis , strom & wilson 1974 ; strom & willis 1980 ) .",
    "the second largest , recently discovered , 3.56-mpc radio galaxy is wnb2147 + 816 ( palma et al . 2000 ) . proceeding with our investigation of low - luminosity giant radiosource candidates ( cf .",
    "jamrozy & machalski 1999 ; machalski & jamrozy 2000 ) , selected from the vla surveys : first ( becker , white & helfand 1995 ) and nvss ( condon et al .",
    "1998 ) , we focussed our attention on the source j1343 + 3758 .",
    "this source can be discerned in the 325-mhz wenss survey ( rengelink et al .",
    "1997 ) and 1.4-ghz vla nvss survey as a 11.3 arc min large frii - type radio source .",
    "the source consists of the two extended radio lobes , possibly connected with a very dimmed bridge . at the outer edges of both lobes",
    "there are more compact bright regions clearly visible on the relevant first map j134300 + 38071e.coadd.1 , however from that first map alone one could not be sure that these bright regions belong to the same source .",
    "the region in the ne lobe contains a very bright hot spot .",
    "the source was also detected during the low - resolution sky surveys at 151 and 232 mhz ( 6c2 : hales , baldwin & warner 1988 ; zhang et al .",
    "1997 , respectively ) . in the 408 mhz and 4.85 ghz surveys ( b3 : ficarra , grueff & tomassetti 1985",
    "; gb6 : gregory et al .",
    "1996 , respectively ) , only its sw lobe was detected above the survey s limit .",
    "the first map may suggest a radio core with 1.4-ghz flux density of about 1.5 mjy at the j2000 position : ra @xmath4 , dec .",
    "@xmath5 , but the rms noise on this map ( 0.15 mjy beam@xmath2 ) produced other spots of comparable intensity .",
    "therefore , we have made additional high - frequency vla observations which allow us to confirm its radio core and firmly identify the source with a galaxy at the redshift of 0.229 .",
    "this vla observations are described and the radio spectrum of the entire source and its lobes are determined in sect .  2 .",
    "the optical spectroscopy of the identified galaxy is described in sect .",
    "3 . in sect .  4 ,",
    "the equipartition magnetic field and energy density within the lobes as well as the lifetime of relativistic electrons at the frequency of 325 mhz and the mean advance velocity of the lobes , are calculated and compared with the respective values found for other giants as well as for much smaller 3cr sources by ishwara - chandra & saikia ( 1999 ) .",
    "finally , the environment density is estimated by the simple counts of galaxies around the identified galaxy and the calculation of particle density around the radio lobes .",
    "a field centred at the pressumed core position taken from the first map ( cf . sect .",
    "1 ) was observed with the vla b  array at 4.86 ghz .",
    "this observing frequency and the array configuration did not allow us to map the brightness distribution in the extended lobes with their brightest regions lying 56 arc min apart from the core .",
    "the observations were conducted on december 13 , 1999 .",
    "@xmath6 of the synthesized beam was @xmath7 . with the integration time of @xmath8 min ,",
    "the rms fluctuations were about 26 @xmath9jy  beam@xmath2 .",
    "the @xmath10 core component of 0.7 mjy beam@xmath2 and the integral flux density of 1.1 mjy was detected at @xmath4 , @xmath11 ( j2000 ) .",
    "besides the core , very much attenuated emission was detected from the hotspot in the ne lobe .",
    "1 shows the radio contours of the source taken from the nvss map c1348p36.iqu.1 overlayed on the brightness from our 4.86-ghz map ( gray scale ) . because of very large scale of the entire source , poorly visible dot indicating the radio core is marked by the cross . the most compact structure in the ne lobe , reproduced from the 1.4-ghz first map ( cf .",
    "sect .  1 ) ,",
    "and our 4.86-ghz map resolving the hotspot are shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the deconvolved size of the hotspot at 1.4 ghz is @xmath12 at pa=+83@xmath13 .",
    "this hotspot is resolved at 4.86 ghz into two components with the deconvolved sizes of @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "these sizes are used in sect .  4 to estimate the area of the bowshock and ambient density of the environment in front of a head of the ne lobe .",
    "the degree of asymmetry of j1343 + 3758 is low .",
    "the ratio of separation between the core and brightest regions in the lobes and the misalingnment angle are 1.32 and 3 deg , respectively .",
    "the widths of the lobes ( 322 kpc and 274 kpc ) are determined using the prescription of leahy & williams ( 1984 ) , i.e. the deconvolved half - power widths are multiplied by the factor @xmath16 .",
    "the average of the above values give the overall axial ratio of 10.5 .",
    "the age of relativistic electrons in the radio lobes @xmath17 radiating at a given frequency @xmath18 can be deduced from the values of @xmath19 and @xmath20 . again following the analysis of ishwara - chandra & saikia , we have calculated @xmath21 at @xmath22 mhz . using their expression ( cf . also alexander & leahy 1987 and liu , pooley & riley 1992 ) which is derived under assumption that electrons are isotropized on time - scales much shorter than their radiative lifetime ( jp model : jaffe & perola 1974 )",
    ", we found @xmath23 yr .",
    "it is somehow lower than @xmath24 yr for ishwara - chandra & saikia s giants with @xmath25 , and closer to @xmath26 yr for those at @xmath27 .",
    "however , this is worth to emphasize that the jp model predicts the fastest steepening of synchrotron spectrum at high frequencies , while its slowest steepening is provided in the case of continuous injection of energetic particles ( ci model ) ; for the detailed description cf .",
    "myers & spangler ( 1985 ) .",
    "because of very limited observational data , one can not distinguish which model of the radiative losses would be plausible for j1343 + 3758 , but this model - dependent uncertainty of the synchrotron lifetime of particles in its lobes is less than that introduced by other effects like unknown filling factor , energy distribution between electrons and protons , or uncertain volume .",
    "if the main axis of the source is close to the plane of the sky , the distance from the core to the brightest regions in the lobes will be within 1.4 mpc and 1.8 mpc .",
    "relating @xmath23 yr to any distance between the above values , the advance speed of the lobes material should be about @xmath28 .",
    "this value is still within the speed range found for much smaller , double 3cr radio sources ( e.g. alexander & leahy ; liu et al . ) .",
    "this advance speed can suggest that the source achieved its present size due to expansion in a low - density environment . to check this , we followed hill & lilly ( 1991 ) and estimated the environment density by simple counts of galaxies around the identified galaxy .",
    "we define @xmath29 as the net excess number of galaxies with @xmath30 magnitude from @xmath31 to @xmath32 and within 1.5 mpc radius around our galaxy .",
    "using the dss data base and adopting @xmath33 mag , we found 30 galaxies to meet the above criterium .",
    "however , the number of galaxies with @xmath34 mag can be underestimated in the dss as they can be seen at the poss e ",
    "plates only , therefore we adopt @xmath35 .",
    "the relevant number of background galaxies , @xmath36 was found using the differential counts @xmath37 deg@xmath38mag@xmath2 ] ( tyson 1988 ) .",
    "resultant negative net value @xmath40 indicates that j1343 + 3758 lies in a distinctly poor region of intergalactic medium .",
    "this conclusion is further supported by an estimate of the particle density around the lobes .",
    "following lacy et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , we assume that the heads of lobes are ram - pressure confined . taking the deconvolved diameter of the hotspot in the ne lobe as 3 arc sec , we can estimate the ambient density @xmath41 g  @xmath42 . this estimate is lower by an order than that found for the other giants ( cf .",
