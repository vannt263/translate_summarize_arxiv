    "recently there has been much interest in the collective properties of particle equilibrium @xcite and nonequilibrium @xcite systems in study of the early universe @xcite and of the heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "both kind of systems are intrinsically nonequilibrium in nature , and only some details of their behaviour may be considered in the frame of equilibrium description .",
    "the most useful in the quantum field theory ( qft ) is the green s function method .",
    "it was used by schwinger , keldysh @xcite and others ( see @xcite for a review ) for the nonequilibrium case when the system is subjected to the `` mechanical '' perturbations ( perturbations that may be considered as a part of the hamiltonian @xcite ) . of course",
    ", mechanical perturbations produce `` thermal '' ones ( variations of the temperature and other thermodynamical parameters @xcite ) .",
    "this property was used by many authors @xcite to estimate kinetic coefficients connected with thermal perturbations ( like thermal conductivity , shear and bulk viscosity etc .",
    "thermal perturbations were taken into account explicitly by mclennan @xcite and zubarev @xcite .",
    "temperature ( and/or chemical potential etc . )",
    "is considered in mentioned approaches as some background field and is not subjected to any influence .",
    "this theories are formulated in terms of density matrix and they generalise the gibbs method to the nonequilibrium case . similar but more complicate from the technical point of view approaches were developed by some other authors @xcite .",
    "another formalism of the qft systems description is thermo - field dynamics constructed by umezawa and co - authors @xcite .",
    "it coincides with other approaches in the stationary case but differs in the nonequilibrium situation @xcite .",
    "this paper is based on the zubarev s density matrix , that is called by author nonequilibrium statistical operator ( nso ) @xcite .",
    "it was used previously in qft ( see @xcite ) in the imaginary - time matsubara formalism @xcite .",
    "our consideration@xcite is done in the real - time and in terms of path integrals @xcite .",
    "consideration of the nonequilibrium is more natural in the real - time approach without procedure of analytic continuation .",
    "it is shown in @xcite that an account of the thermal perturbations leads to some theoretical problems .",
    "a calculation of the following unusual operator product is needed @xmath0 { \\rm t}\\left[\\hat{\\phi}(n+1)\\cdots \\hat{\\phi}(m)\\right]\\cdots\\right\\ } , \\label{1}\\ ] ] where @xmath1 and @xmath2 means time ordering of the operators .",
    "the rarity of this expression is due to the presence of two @xmath2-ordering procedures .",
    "it may be called `` double ( multi ) time - ordered product '' .",
    "i shall solve this problem in terms of path integrals for quantum field theory in vacuum ( sec . 3 ) and in the heat bath ( sec . 4 ) .",
    "in this section it is briefly reviewed how double - time operator product ( [ 1 ] ) occur in the nonequilibrium qft @xcite .",
