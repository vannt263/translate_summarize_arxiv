    "within a generation of imaginary numbers taming , william rowan hamilton etched his famous @xmath5 equation on the bridge he was crossing , thereby giving us quaternions ( and , eventually , the tools of vector calculus derived from their workings ) . within months",
    ", arthur cayley and john graves independently generalized his 4-d ( noncommutative ) complex quantities to the 8-d ( nonassociative ) octonions .",
    "but before the century was out , attempts to extend hypercomplex number systems indefinitely , by the cdp dimension - doubling algorithm , met with an impediment : in 1896 , adolf hurwitz proved that the next redoubling ( to the 16-d sedenions ) would continue the pattern of giving up something familiar as the price of admission ; only this time , the very notion of a norm ( and hence , of division algebra itself ) would be forfeit .",
    "[ 1 ] the necessity of zero - divisors ( non - null numbers with zero product ) in all higher @xmath6-ions , @xmath7 , almost instantly squelched the ambitions of number theorists  with such thoroughness , that the next ( 32-d ) numbers were never even given a name , much less investigated seriously . yet these pathions , as we ll term them ( as in `` pathological , '' which is what such entities were deemed ) are precisely those which hold the key to underwriting ( and algebraically generalizing ) fractals with number theory .",
    "there is much more than irony in the fact that fractals themselves were similarly dismissed as `` monstrosities ''  only to be later tamed and rendered commonplace by benoit mandelbrot .",
    "[ 2 ] for , thanks to their attribute of being scale - free ( as statistical distributions ) , fractals buttress the recent theory of _ complex networks _ [ 3 ]  which theory can be given its own number theoretic basis ( making it henceforth less reliant on empirical methods ) by dint of zd ensembles . such a network - enabling meta - fractal ( each of whose infinite points is associated with one among an infinite number of orthogonal lines of zds ) we call a sky  for it is where box - kites fly .",
    "these latter ensembles of 6 orthogonal planes , each represented by a vertex on an octahedral frame , are the basic molecules of zd structures .",
    "their workings ( and manner of embedding in skies , which we ll visualize via spreadsheet - like `` emanation tables '' or ets ) will be our first concern .",
    "once we understand their interrelations , we will be able to generate the simple rules that use the bit - string of a box - kite ensemble s integer signature to fill or hide et cells , in a manner implying approach to the `` fractal limit . ''",
    "our argument , like caesar s gaul , naturally divides into three parts . in this part",
    "i , our focus will be on the octahedral box - kite representation , which can organize all the seminal concepts of zero - divisor theory in the 16-d context in which it first emerged , and end with a first foray into 32-d , fabricating the small set of fundamental tools we ll need to keep expanding our agenda recursively into 64 , 128 , 256 , then infinite dimensions . in part ii , we introduce the spreadsheet - like means of representing ensembles of box - kites  the emanation tables alluded to last paragraph  which lead to a graphics more suggestive of colored quilts than any regular figures euclid might have known . their resemblance to classical fractals",
    "will soon be evident , and culminate in our construction of the simplest ( `` whorfian '' ) sky , whose basic building blocks only first emerge in 32-d .",
    "finally , in part iii , we will construct the component parts of the algorithm which lets us build an infinite - dimensional meta - fractal sky that is unique to any integer @xmath4 and not a power of 2 ( which is how we can justify calling our study a branch of number theory ",
    "but one based on bit - string - suggestive placeholder structures , with powers of 2 playing a role roughly akin to that of prime numbers in the quantity - fixated contemplations of which the greeks were so fond ) . here",
    ", we conclude with what literally boils down to``cookbook instructions '' for building arbitrary skies , allowing for nks - style movements between them  the recipe theory suggested in our abstract .",
    "we use the most general cdp labeling scheme : units are subscripted from 0 ( reals ) to @xmath8 ; the product ( up to sign ) of any two has subscript equal to the xor of the producing terms subscripts . call * g * the index of the cdp generator of @xmath9-ions from @xmath6-ions .",
    "then @xmath10 ( @xmath11 for sedenions ) , and we have rule 1 : for @xmath6-ion index @xmath12 , @xmath13 .",
    "once we have at least one associative triplet ( trip ) to work with , we can invoke rule 2 : writing in cyclically positive order ( cpo ) so positive units multiplied left to right always result in another , creating a new trip by adding @xmath14 to _ 2 _ terms of another _ reverses the order _ : @xmath15 .",
    "these 2 rules ( plus a rule 0 which says trips in @xmath6-ions remain trips in all higher @xmath16-ions , @xmath17 ) completely describe trip - making , hence cdp .",
    "_ examples .",
    "_ appending a unit @xmath18 to the standard complex plane , rule 1 gives us @xmath19  the usual @xmath20 of quaternions ( @xmath21-ions ) .",
    "performing one further iteration with @xmath22 , rule 1 applied to the singleton q - trip ( 1,2,3 ) yields @xmath23 o - trips @xmath24 . by rule 2",
    ", we also derive 3 more : @xmath25 ; @xmath26 ; and , @xmath27 . altogether , then , cdp says octonions contain @xmath28 o - trips  the _ trip count _ for @xmath29 , or just _ @xmath30 _ , a number we derive independently by simple combinatorics : to form an associative triplet , pick one unit from those available , then pick a second from those remaining , and then divide by 6 to allow for all the permutations that could have led to the designated triplet being fixed by 2 selections .",
    "( hence , the sedenions , with @xmath31 , have @xmath32 s - trips ; pathions , with @xmath33 , have @xmath34 p - trips ; @xmath35 = 651 , and so on . )    _ remarks .",
    "_ the unique q - trip can be rotated to bring its units indices into aco ( ascending counting order ) as well as cpo : @xmath36 . 2 of the 7 o - trips , though  @xmath37 and @xmath38  are `` bad trips . ''",
    "inspection of our examples indicates that of the 3 new trips resulting from applying rule 2 to the q - trip , only one  o - trip @xmath39  will be `` good '' in turn .",
    "corollarily , starting with the sedenions , rule 2 will produce 2 `` good '' and 1 `` bad '' trip for each `` bad trip '' fed into it : for instance , @xmath40 . simple algebra readily persuades us that @xmath41 ; further , that `` bad trips '' among the @xmath9-ions = @xmath42 , and `` good , '' this number augmented by the rule 1 contribution , or @xmath43 .",
    "hence , as @xmath44 , good and bad trips approach parity .",
    "treat the 8 triangles of an octahedron as like a checkerboard , with those of same color meeting only at vertices .",
    "but instead of colors , envisage 4 are sails ( jibs x , y , z , w , made of mylar , say ) , while those on the faces opposite them are vents ( through which the wind blows ) .",
    "the 3 pairs of opposite vertices are separated by _ struts _  wood or plastic doweling in real - world kites .",
    "strut - opposites _ are the _ only _ pairings of vertices which are _ not _ mutual `` divisors making zero '' ( dmzs ) : traversing any of the 12 edges always `` makes zero , '' as the ends of each host two ( mutually exclusive ) dmz pairs .",
    "for this to make sense , we must explain what we mean by `` traverse '' in this context . at each vertex are two imaginary units of different index ( one , as we ll show , always with index less than * g *  a or b , say  while the other is always of index greater  h or j ) .",
    "the edge between any two box - kite vertices which are nt strut opposites _",
    "always _ connects two such dyads whose possible products include zeros .",
    "their general product consists of four components , created by simple term - by - term multiplication . with proper sign choices ( a crucial matter to which we ll return shortly ) ,",
    "the product of the units indexed b and h will exactly cancel that of the units indexed a and j ; likewise , the product of those indexed a and b will exactly cancel that of units indexed h and j. ( note , in this last case , the high bits of h and j cancel by xor , whereas a and b , being less than * g * , lack these high bits to begin with . ) also , we say _ two _ sets of dmz pairs framing each edge , since each vertex represents one among 6 orthogonal _ planes _ , each spanned by a pair of hypercomplex axes , whose _ diagonals _",
    "house all ( and only ) `` primitive '' zds .    for the case just given , we write @xmath45 and @xmath46 , with one of these providing 2 of the 4 terms in the zero product made with a @xmath47-indexed diagonal .",
    "we will see in theorem 3 that 2 of the 4 possible choices of diagonals to multiply together will always have zero product , and determining which pairings `` make zero '' is where signing comes in .",
    "put another way , since cdp - generated imaginaries square to @xmath48 tautologically , a zd is `` primitive '' only if comprised of the sum or difference of _ two _ such imaginaries .",
    "( dmz also signifies `` _ _ dyads _ _ making zero . '' ) `` traversing '' an edge , then , entails multiplying arbitrary points on suitably matched diagonals , one chosen from each terminating dyad , allowing some choice ( since the order in which we multiply them has no effect on whether we get a zero or not ) as to which end we think of as the starting point .    the reason for this image will become clear when we consider chaining such traversals : certain sequences of vertex - to - vertex multiplication effectively take us on closed tours of some subset of the box - kite s pathways , in such a way that we always `` make zero '' at each step in our circuiting",
    ". there are only a few such closed circuits , falling into a small number of types .",
    "these have surprisingly rich and distinctive properties as we shall see .",
    "our focus here , though , will be primarily on the 3-vertex , 6-cyclic , kind , which we ve already given a name : the sail . ( the third vertex is _ emanated _ by the first two zds , since the zero the latter make is in fact the sum of two oppositely signed copies of this third dyad s terms .",
    "what makes the sail an algebraic whole is the fact , shown in theorem 5 , that _ any _ of its 3 edges , when traversed , emanates the third vertex in this sense . )    as the general reader is likely not a trained algebraist , some connection between such notions and those more familiar to computer - based thinking are appropriate .",
    "we note , then , that no notion is more fundamental than that of a solution , and the algebraic study of solution spaces can be seen as fundamentally devolving upon zero divisors and imaginary quantities simultaneously .",
    "the very origins of the algebraic theory of equations demanded imaginaries as intermediary terms , as cardano found when he discovered the general form of the cubic equation in the renaissance . and as is well known , the intractibility of quintic equations to extensions of such methods led to the classic group - theory - spawning studies of abel and galois . and here , we find the symmetry groups of equations devolving upon the structure of the zeros they contain .    taking the step from calling the two terms @xmath49 in a quadratic equation , say , mere factors , to legitimate zero - divisors in our sense here ,",
    "is one in keeping with historically recent paradigm shifts in physics .",
    "the move from point particles to 1-d strings and multi - dimensional n - branes is roughly parallel to our own shift from zero - divisor _ points _ to diagonal _ lines _ and exotica like the seinfeld hyperplanes of our november , 2000 , paper . and just as one gets from points to lines by stringing an indefinite number of the former together in an ensemble , we will expand the singleton imaginary fundamental to galois thinking to the infinite array of such units afforded by cdp .    as cdp will be our starting point when our argument resumes ,",
    "we allow ourselves one final comment before returning to it .",
    "galoisian zeros offer a basis for modern representation theory , providing the starter kit ( once embedded in sophus lie s continuous - groups treatment ) for handling all linear forms ( and even the `` elementary '' singularities of nonlinear kind comprising ren thom s now - classical catastrophe theory ) .",
    "but the representation of the nonlinear , we claim , requires methods in the general case like those we adumbrate ( and , to some small degree , actually implement ) herein . and",
    ", knowing nothing more than the cdp rules , we can exclude some very general cases :    theorem 1 .",
    "neither dyad can contain only indices @xmath50 .    _ proof . _",
    "if both dyads contain only octonions , their product will contain only octonions , which have no zds ; by induction , no zds new to the @xmath6-ions generated by * g * can emerge from products of terms with indices @xmath50 .",
    "if only one dyad has both terms indices @xmath50 , the term @xmath51 in the other will have unequal products with the first dyad s two terms .",
    "but , by xor , these will also be the only terms with indices @xmath51 , preventing cancelation of either .",
    "@xmath52    theorem 2 . for any @xmath6-ions , the unit indexed by",
    "* g * can not belong to a zd dyad .",
    "_ proof . _ given trip @xmath53 and binary variable @xmath54 , write @xmath55 below , and @xmath56 above , and multiply term by term .",
    "the products by @xmath57 are @xmath58 and @xmath59 ( rule 1 ) .",
    "products by @xmath60 , however , are @xmath61 ( given ) and @xmath62 ( rule 2 ) . depending on @xmath63 , one or the other , but not both",
    ", pairs will cancel .",
    "@xmath52    _ remark .",
    "_ when @xmath0 increases , former generators form zds . starting with the pathions ,",
    "though , a condition we term _ carrybit overflow _ can arise , wherein indices sufficiently large to play different roles for different @xmath0 cause the breakdown of zero - division behavior in many cases where we would expect it , and it is precisely because of this that the meta - fractal skies will arise .",
    "theorem 3 .",
    "suppose two dyads each contain one unit whose index @xmath64 , written in upper case , and another whose index @xmath50 , written lower case",
    ". then if @xmath65 , @xmath66 does not , and vice - versa .    _",
    "_ given the zero result , the ab and ab terms , however signed , must cancel , as must ab and ab .",
    "but changing only _",
    "one _ sign in one or the other dyad reverses sign on one unit only in each pair .",
    "@xmath52    _ remark .",
    "_ clearly , multiplying either dyad by a real scalar @xmath67 has no effect on zd status , which is why these zds are best thought of as _ diagonal line elements_. represent zd diagonals @xmath68 and @xmath69 in the obvious graphical manner as @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively .",
    "it is easy to show these corollaries :    @xmath72    @xmath73    theorem 4 .",
    "two zd diagonals spanned by the same imaginary units can not be dmzs .",
    "_ @xmath74 on top , and @xmath75 on the bottom .",
    "but @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath52    _ remark .",
    "_ this is the exact opposite of the ( non - cdp ) zds found in quantum mechanics ( qm ) , where the mutual annihilation of the idempotent projection operators @xmath77 , @xmath78 a pauli spin matrix ( so that @xmath79 ) , serves to define observables .",
    "there is a sense , however , in which the qm case is a degenerate form of the behaviors being examined here : this would take us off topic , but those interested in such questions should see [ 4 ] .    a final exclusion rule , alluded to above : zds living in planes associated with strut - opposite vertices can never be dmzs .",
    "this is a deeper result than those just presented , and is a side - effect of the general production rules , to which we turn next .",
    "in the sedenions , the most general production rule allows anything not excluded by the rules above : pick any octonion of index @xmath80 ( 7 ways ) , then any pure sedenion with index @xmath81 not the xor of @xmath80 with * g * ; the resulting dyad spans one of 42 planes  the 42 assessors of [ 5 ] , where the other production rules are also described for the first time . for higher @xmath6-ions , restrictions due to",
    "carrybit overflow arise , but the approach just limned still generates all _ candidates _ for `` primitive zd '' status .    from this rule to box - kites is but a short distance : for , since each sedenion assessor will have an octonion in its dyad of units , clearly we can arrange their 42 planes in 7 clusters of 6 , each of which excludes a different octonion from its set . call the octonion index in each dyad ( and , more generally , the @xmath6-ion index @xmath82 ) the l - index , and its partner the u - index , and write their respective units @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "since each octonion is involved in precisely 3 o - trips , the 6 l - indices in each cluster can be uniquely fixed in 2 steps : first , assign each pair whose xor is the excluded index to one of the 3 struts , which is necessary and sufficient to guarantee that their product does not appear in the set .",
    "( from what we ve already seen , even without specifying what their u - indices are , this is tantamount to guaranteeing that no pairing of their assessors diagonals can be dmzs . )",
    "call the excluded index * s * , for `` strut constant '' and `` signature . ''",
    "the last parenthetical remark tells us it somehow fixes the u - indices of the assessors in its cluster .",
    "we will see how in the next section . for now , the more immediate problem of fixing l - indices leads us to perform our second step .",
    "orient the strut - opposite l - indices so that * s * is the central label in the psl(2,7 ) triangle which represents the smallest finite projective group , also called the fano plane .",
    "its 3 vertices , 3 sides midpoints , and center each host an octonion index , in 7 oriented lines of 3 points each , one per o - trip ( in 480 possible configurations ) .",
    "then , assign the l - index trip in the circle threading the sides midpoints to vertices @xmath85 , @xmath86 , @xmath87 on a box - kite , in cpo order .",
    "the strut - opposite l - indices will then appear as the vertices which terminate the lines extending from their l - index partners through * s*. we label them , in `` nested parentheses '' order , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 respectively .    by removing the central label , four of the 7 lines in psl(2,7 ) remain connected : that of the central circle just discussed , whose l - indices form the triplet @xmath53 ; and , the 3 along the triangle s sides , which the diagram tells us have cpo labels @xmath91 , @xmath92 , and @xmath93 .",
    "we will show next section how these form the bases of the two types of sails  the singleton zigzag at vertices @xmath94 , and the three trefoils which each share a different vertex with the zigzag  and demonstrate their special properties , which hold for all box - kites in all @xmath6-ions .",
    "for now , we introduce the other production rules , the first of which motivates the very idea of a sail .",
    "theorem 5 .",
    "if assessors @xmath95 and @xmath96 form dmzs , then a third assessor @xmath97 , forming dmzs with both , can be created by setting the index of @xmath98 to @xmath99 , and that of @xmath100 to @xmath101 .",
    "_ without loss of generality , assume l - index trip @xmath102 is cpo , and the dyads of the given dmz have same internal signing : that is , @xmath103 .",
    "we then have @xmath104 ; but @xmath105 , so @xmath106 as well .",
    "using @xmath63 as before , write @xmath107 = sg \\cdot [ - uv ] $ ] .",
    "consider @xmath108 , the former written under the latter .",
    "( the same basic argument applies if we choose @xmath109 instead and write it on top . ) multiplying left to right by @xmath110 , we have @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "next , @xmath113 . and @xmath114 .",
    "set @xmath115 , and all terms cancel .",
    "_ two assessors in the same box - kite _ emanate _ a third whose l - index completes the l - trip implied by the other two .",
    "( the zero they make is also a sum of oppositely signed copies of the emanated assessor . )",
    "such a triad defines a _ sail_.    _ caveat . _ the proof as given is complete within the sedenions , which display alternativity : @xmath116 . generalizing to higher @xmath6-ions",
    ", however , requires a further result we ll derive later , namely : all three index - triples involving one lowercase and two uppercase letters , each from a different assessor in a sail , are trips , so that even _ associativity _ among units combined as required in our proof is guaranteed .",
    "theorem 6 .",
    "if @xmath117 and @xmath118 are dmzs , then so are their _ twist products _ @xmath119 and @xmath120 .    _ proof .",
    "_ by direct multiplication , the dmz given requires @xmath121 and @xmath104 .",
    "the proposed dmz resulting from the twist would require @xmath122 , and @xmath123 .",
    "but the second requirement is identical to what we know is true in the given dmz . as for the first requirement , multiply the terms of the other known relation on the right by @xmath124 to obtain it .",
    "_ caveat added in v3 . _ the proof as given is complete within the sedenions ; however , it does nt hold universally for the pathions and beyond , when strut constants can exceed 8  a side - effect , and necessary correlate , of the emergence of the `` meta - fractal '' structures that will concern us in the second and third installments of this argument . perhaps surprisingly , this proves to be a virtue : the lanyards based on circuiting squares , not triangles , are the natural vehicles with which to see twist products deployed , and it is",
    "thanks to the twists which do _ not _ yield zds that we can study transformations between legitimate box - kites and the `` broken '' kind lacking zd pathing which comprise meta - fractals . such topics , however , will not be broached in any of the three parts of this monograph ; rather , they require their background to be dealt with , and hence will provide the subject matter for their immediate sequel .",
    "_ a few months after [ 5 ] , and quite independently of it , raoul cawagas obtained the same listing of primitive zds in the sedenions .",
    "he obtained it by programmatic exploration , using his finitas software , of _ loops _",
    "( which do for nonassociative algebras what groups do for their more orderly cousins ) .",
    "[ 6 ] in our correspondence , it became clear that twist products in fact connect zds which , while necessarily in different box - kites , are always in the same loop .",
    "each of a box - kite s 4 sails `` twist '' to different loops , while each cawagas loop meanwhile partitions into 4 sets that correspond to sails in different box - kites , indicating an interesting duality between the two quite differently framed approaches and their objects .",
    "for the surprising symmetries inherent in twist product patterns , see the discussions surrounding the royal hunt and twisted sister diagrams in [ 7 , pp .",
    "14 - 16 ] .",
    "see [ 5 , pp .",
    "11 - 21 ] for full exposition of all the production rules being discussed here , and pp .",
    "15 - 16 for the twist product rule in particular .",
    "_ coming attractions .",
    "once the workings of the strut constant are understood , the reader will find it trivial to prove that opposite sides of any of the 3 orthogonal squares comprising the box - kite s octahedral framework twist to the same box - kite , while adjacent sides twist to different ones .",
    "( the trick is to realize that , for all assessors in any given box - kite , the xor of their dyads indices is @xmath125 ) .",
    "this suggests that the 3 squares , which we will call catamarans ( tray - racks in earlier papers ) , are as fundamental as the 4 sails , but for the different purpose of long - distance navigating ; we conventionally name them for the tall masts planted orthogonally on the transverse frames joining their hulls : @xmath126 for catamaran @xmath127 , for example .",
    "catamarans also come in pairs : as will also be clear when edge - signs are described , tracing the perimeter of a catamaran only engages 4 of the 8 zd diagonals in the assessor planes being passed through , whereas tracing a sail twice will engage all 6 residing in its 3 assessors .",
    "catamarans , then , with their square perimeters and coming in pairs , could easily be represented by traditional box - kites , as opposed to our surreal octahedral ones .    lemma . as every l - index appears in two distinct l - trips in a given box - kite ,",
    "likewise every assessor appears in two distinct sails .",
    "_ full xor - based calculation requires knowledge of the u - indices , which requires , in turn , a better understanding of the special role played by the strut constant  which will be our focus in the next section .",
    "the debt to the groundbreaking work of r. guillermo moreno is evident : his 1997 preprint ( appearing in a mexican journal the following year [ 8 ] ) revivified the long - neglected study of zds .",
    "moreno s now - classic paper culminated in a formal demonstration that the algebra of zds in the sedenions was homomorphic to the lie algebra @xmath128 , itself the automorphism group of @xmath129 , in turn represented by the octonions  a result seemingly of interest only to physicists .",
    "yet he also pointed out that this same @xmath128 is the derivation algebra of @xmath9-ions from @xmath6-ions , implying a deepset recursiveness in zd structuring .",
    "we underscore that the fano plane diagram for octonion labeling is likewise a potentially recursive tool : the 15 points and 35 lines , with 7 lines through every point and 3 planes in each line , of the 3-d `` projective tetrahedron '' that schematizes sedenion labeling , is further cobbled together from 15 planes isomorphic to the @xmath130 triangle .",
    "higher labeling structures of @xmath8 points , @xmath131 lines , and so on , are readily imagined ( albeit impossible to visualize ) .",
    "our next results will be derived with virtually no tools beyond cdp and psl(2,7 ) .",
    "we begin with a concretization of the discussion which introduced the latter last section .",
    "place the indices of the octonions so as to reflect their construction via cdp from quaternions : in the center of an equilateral triangle , place @xmath22 ; with apex extending above 12 oclock , place @xmath132 at the midpoints of the left , right , and bottom sides , oriented clockwise , at 10 , 2 , and 6 oclock in that order .",
    "now its projective line , the only one drawn as a circle , represents the rule 0 trip ; lines oriented from the midpoints to and through the center are the rule 1 trips ; the sides , meanwhile , constitute the rule 2 trips , and are all oriented in a clockwise manner , paralleling the flow along the rule 0 circle .",
    "now replace @xmath132 with the letters @xmath133 , and replace the indices at the angles with the symbols @xmath134 , as these are indeed @xmath135 , @xmath110 and @xmath100 s strut - opposites with respect to the central index , which we now replace with the symbol * s * for strut constant .",
    "the contents of the labels are indeterminate , but their choices must conform to the network of flows : clockwise along edges and central circle , and pointing inward along the 3 lines bifurcating sides , then angles . in our initial setup , the octonion generator is indeed the * s * for the sedenion box - kite implicated . in a manner suggestive of how one pulls on and removes slipcovers from upholstery , we claim that this flow pattern is not only uniquely linked to representations with the central circle comprising the l - indices of the zigzag sail ; but that one can , without inducing any tearing in the network of flows , `` pull '' any octonion index into the center , thereby representing a zigzag - centric depiction of the box - kite whose @xmath136 is that index .",
    "psl(2,7 ) has the ( for our purposes ) highly useful property that , in order to obtain a correct multiplication scheme for the 7 units , it suffices to place @xmath133 on any line , mark any of the remaining 4 points @xmath136 , and then pass through it to designate the last trio of points as opposites of the first .",
    "swapping in one point for another , then , is easy .",
    "the symmetries are so complete that we can take any point we please and make the case for all , so let s take 7 in the @xmath137 diagram . rotate the line containing 4 and 7 once in the downward direction to keep orientation : the vertical line , in top - down order , now reads @xmath138 instead of @xmath139 . the central circle ,",
    "if its clockwise orientation is to be kept , must be cpo starting with the left midpoint and ending in the 4 now on the bottom .",
    "there are just 2 possibilities  @xmath140 and @xmath141  but",
    "the former would reverse the flow on the right flank , reading @xmath132 from the lower right to the apex .",
    "as is readily checked , @xmath141 does exactly what we want  and , as our table of sedenion assessors and strut constants makes clear , that is in fact the zigzag l - trip for the @xmath142 box - kite .",

    "each , supplemented by the reals , makes a legitimate copy of the quaternions .",
    "moreover , any box - kite in any @xmath6-ion domain will have sails with this property , it being a feature of our rule 2 and psl(2,7 ) s recursivity , rather than anything specific to ( hence subject to the limits of ) sedenion space .",
    "we merely use whatever @xmath14 is appropriate in our `` slipcover proofs '' and choose a rule 0 triplet to place in the central circle ; or , equivalently , pick whatever trio of strut - opposites you care to use which satisfy the given @xmath136 value .",

    "concerns determining this rapidly growing number for arbitrarily large counts of variables .",

    "we will conclude , as our abstract suggests , with just such a `` recipe theory '' with which to study infinite - dimensional meta - fractals .",
    "we will prepare for that journey by taking leave of simple box - kites in the sedenions , and go so far in this section as to find the first truly anomalous ensembles , with the `` wrong number '' of box - kites , in the 32-d pathions .",
    "we first want to indicate that even simple box - kites are much richer in structure than we have seen thus far .",
    "the two kinds of sails are instantiations of abstract objects we call _ lanyards _  cords worn around the neck to hold knives or whistles , or strands of leather or plastic used to string beads and other gewgaws into charm bracelets . by chaining together dmzs ,",
    "a lanyard threads the zd diagonals of multiple assessors , attaining closure by returning to its starting point having touched all other zds in its ambit but once .",
    "they can be given signatures even more compressed than the notation developed in the remark to theorem 3 : the zigzag is a 6-cycle lanyard , which `` makes zero '' with all its sail s diagonals , in a sequence cyclically equivalent to the glyph inspiring its name : ` / \\ / \\",
    "the trefoil has its own 6-cycle signature : ` / / / \\ \\ \\ ` .",
    "( the catamaran , meanwhile , has 4-cycle signature ` / / \\ \\ ` , which should clarify our earlier cryptic comments concerning it . )",
    "joins between diagonals with opposite inner sign we designate either with a [ - ] _ edge symbol _ , else  if availing ourselves of color graphics  draw in red .",
    "exactly half a box - kite s 12 edges are red , consisting of the trio defining the zigzag , and those bordering the vent on the face opposite it .",
    "( see diagram on left of figure 2 . )",
    "those edges linking similarly inner - signed diagonals are marked [ + ] or painted blue .",
    "`` the blues , '' in fact , are two other 6-cycle lanyards which contain all and only the blue edges , corresponding to the perimeter of the hexagon in the prior image . _ two _ , because one connects only ` \\ ` diagonals , the other only ` / ` s .",
    "what might a simulation that switched edge - signs ( converting the blues into zigzags , perhaps ? ) correspond to in real - world processes ?",
    "another type of 6-cycle lanyard , the 2-sail , 5-assessor `` bow - tie '' whose doubly passed - through `` knot '' must be in the zigzag , has deep symmetry - breaking properties that may well play a fundamental role in string theory [ 4 ] . in general , each distinct lanyard ( and there are others which the reader is invited to explore involving 4 , 5 , and all 6 assessors :",
    "see section iii of [ 5 ] for more on some of these ) creates a distinctive context of dynamic possibilities , rather than the semblance of an answer ( as groups , too often , are assumed to offer ) . and , unlike groups , and as one might expect in @xmath160- rather than @xmath143- based algebraics , an identity element is nowhere in sight , with strut opposites the closest thing to inverses .",
    "rather , the zero resultant defining the transit of each link in a lanyard s chain guarantees a certain design - hiding , suggestive of the unfolding of the multitude of zeros packed in a single seed - form or morphogenetic `` vanishing point . ''",
    "put another way , a theory of lanyards can be expected to provide some crucial ideas in an area currently lacking many : the study of nonlinear representations .",
    "one area where a theory of nonlinear representations exists is in semiotics , where the french school of jean petitot  dually inspired by ren thom s catastrophe theory ( ct ) mathematics in the 1970 s , and the structural rapprochement of semantics and syntax essayed by algirdas greimas  led to ct modeling of `` archetypal nouns and verbs '' on the one hand , and a delving beneath chomskian notions of semantically impoverished recursiveness on the other . using the ct toolkit",
    ", petitot has built models of greimas own famous ( among literary theorists , at least ) semiotic square , [ 11 ] as well as the equally celebrated ( among , at least , the structuralism - savvy with anthropological leanings ) canonical law of myths of claude lvi - strauss .",
    "[ 12 ] but both these models can be embedded , in their turn , in zd - based networks , which put the recursiveness back where it belongs : not at the level of meaning as such , but rather in how meaning - rich nodes can be constellated in an open - ended scale - free dynamic .",
    "the key insights are two : first , to see the entire program of structural linguistics  whose origins were contemporary with the algebraic death - knell sounded by hurwitz s proof  as a kind of cdp _ manqu _ , thanks to hjelmslev s indefinitely extensible notion ( seminal to greimas thinking ) of form vs. content _ double articulation_. [ 13 ] the second insight is to find semiotic substance in what would seem a _",
    "lack _ of substance from our purview : by analogy with shannon - weaver self - correcting error - code theory , where most of the bits are expended in the error - trapping as opposed to the content being transmitted , we assume the area of interest is precisely the zd - challenged parts of the zd ensembles that convey the significances .",
    "specifically , we find our meta - model of petitot s ct reading of the semiotic square in the 4 units whose invariant workings govern the zd - free strut - opposites : the real unit ( which never appears in primitive zds ) , @xmath14 and @xmath136 , and their xor ( which , given that @xmath14 always has only one bit , always to the left of all of @xmath136 s , is also their simple sum , henceforth to be called @xmath168 ) .",
    "the index set @xmath169 defines the units of a quaternion copy , part of what moreno terms the 4-d , zd - free boundary of sedenion space , in which all box - kites , each with their own @xmath170 and @xmath171 , participate .",
    "we argue at length in [ 7 ] that the square with drawn diagonals ",
    "@xmath172  which greimas made the centerpiece of his thinking , can be modeled by placing @xmath14 on the diagonals , @xmath171 on the horizontals , and @xmath136 on the verticals . from the zd perspective ,",
    "the workings of the 3 modes of binary relations ( contradiction between a seme and its absence  an on / off bit  along diagonals ; contrareity of reciprocal presupposition along the horizontals ; complementarity of implication along the verticals ) can be formally encapsulated in the following relations .",
    "pick two strut - opposite assessors , dubbing the zigzag dyad picked as @xmath173 , and the vent dyad linked to it , @xmath96 .",
    "then    @xmath174    @xmath175    @xmath176 .",
    "these 3 relations were implicitly derived in passing while proving theorem 7 .",
    "their importance ( and not just for semiotic applications ) suggests we give them a special name : the _ three viziers _ , to be shorthanded henceforth ( and rewritten in triplet form ) as follows :    @xmath177    @xmath178    @xmath179    _ caveat added in v3 .",
    "_ only the second of these three is truly universal ; the first and third are likewise universal _ only if unsigned_. beginning in the pathions , one can find box - kites where precisely two of the three struts have the relative signing of vent and zigzag terms reversed , so that such struts have their vz1 l - index triplets , for instance , written @xmath180 . implied in this",
    "is the existence of a second kind of box - kite , whose nature and very existence only became apparent in work subsequent to this monograph , once catamaran twisting was investigated .",
    "( these `` type ii '' box - kites are in fact indistinguishable from the `` normal '' kind except in regards to such twisting , since struts do not mutually zero - divide anyway , and hence their triplets orientational variations `` fly under the radar '' of the tools we ve built thus far .",
    "they serve as `` middlemen , '' however , between the `` normal '' kind exclusively in evidence in the sedenions , and the zd - free substructures which make up the body of the meta - fractals we ll focus on next . ) skipping over such subtleties , fortunately , has no effect on the _ outcome _ of the general argument we make in this monograph ; a handful of steps in the _ proofs _ , however , will require modification in parts ii and iii .",
    "getting from the atomic level of greimas square , to the small - worlds networking of literally thousands of mythic fragments , all interconnected and mutually unfolded in the four fat volumes of lvi - strauss s magnum opus , would require some surgery on the square , to allow for a competition between contraries , say , to be transmuted into an agreed - upon implication .",
    "but the simplest such transformative structures already require the pathions , and hence meta - fractal skies to fly in .",
    "those are the vistas in front of zd theory , only some of which we will get to see herein .",
    "one such surgery , corresponding to the type just suggested as an example , will in fact provide the first recursive iteration leading to the fractal limit . and , as we re about to see",
    ", it arises naturally , virtually as a built - in feature , of the zd framework .",
    "as anyone seeing a zd diagonal on an oscilloscope screen would think , assessors are ultimately patterns of synchrony and anti - synchrony between their dyadic terms .",
    "assume assessor - unit synchrony breaks down , with dyads recast as strut - opposites .",
    "each finds higher - index partners ; the former @xmath14 and @xmath136 are transformed into pathion l - indices at @xmath181 and @xmath182 , the former @xmath171 moves to center stage as the new @xmath136 .",
    "14 assessors ( @xmath183 , minus 1 more to exclude the strut constant ) form into 3 box - kites sharing the @xmath184 strut .",
    "it is quite possible to draw this three - headed beast  but the many - headed hydras in higher @xmath6-ions will not prove so amenable .",
    "it is time to explore a different mode of representing things , which means emanation tables . and",
    "it is time to deal with a new phenomenon whose crucial nature we ve indicated more than once : for values of @xmath185 , the ensembles associated with each such integer , contain seven , not three , box - kites , and are dubbed _ pliades _ for this reason .",
    "but the surprising graphical sequence revealed as one thumbs through a _",
    "flip - book _ , whose successive pages display _ emanation tables _ linked to progressively incremented @xmath136 values from 9 through 15 , inspired a different name for these entities :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ viewed in sequence , these tables suggest the patterns made by cellular automata ; seen individually , they suggest nothing so much as the short - shelf - life `` sand mandalas '' of tibetan buddhist ritual , made by monks on large flat surfaces with colored sands or powdered flowers , minerals , or even gemstones .",
