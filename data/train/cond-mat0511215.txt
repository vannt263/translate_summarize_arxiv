    "it has been argued for decades that geometrical frustration gives rise to unusual magnetic properties in quantum antiferromagnets , and may bring about an exotic ground state such as a spin liquid which is characterized by the absence of any type of spontaneous symmetry breaking including magnetic long - range order ( lro ) , and dimerization , etc.@xcite the concept of the spin liquid was first proposed by anderson in connection with the ground state of two - dimensional ( 2d ) heisenberg antiferromagnets ( haf ) on a triangular lattice.@xcite while extensive studies on frustrated magnets have revealed that the triangular haf may exhibit the magnetic lro,@xcite the anderson s idea is still attracting much interest , and has been tested for its possible realization in other geometrically frustrated systems such as pyrochlore and kagome haf , and multiple ring exchange spin models.@xcite    recently , shimizu et al .",

    "subsequently , nakatsuji et al . found that in a quasi-2d quantum triangular haf with @xmath7 , niga@xmath2s@xmath3 , there is no sign of lro down to 0.35 k , in spite of the existence of strong anferromagnetic interactions.@xcite in the latter system , the specific heat coefficient @xmath8 shows the quadratic - temperature dependence @xmath9 at sufficiently low temperatures , and the uniform spin susceptibility is constant in the low temperature regions , indicating the existence of low - lying massless excitations .",
    "the origin of these unexpected low - temperature behaviors has not yet been explained .",
    "on the other hand , from theoretical point of view , there have been only a few works on low - energy properties in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition at @xmath10 in the 2d triangular haf.@xcite to understand the above - mentioned experimental observations for quantum triangular haf precisely , we need to develop a theory which describes quantum critical phenomena in these systems at finite temperatures .",
    "in contrast to the quantum case , the three - dimensional ( 3d ) classical stacked heisenberg model , which is equivalent to the 2d quantum model at @xmath10 , has been extensively studied by many authors.@xcite even for the classical systems , the elucidation of the nature of the phase transition has not yet been completed .",
    "several theoretical works done by zumbach , loison and schotte , itakura , and delamotte et al .",
    "indicate that the 3d classical triangular haf show a fluctuation - driven first order phase transition.@xcite on the other hand , the loop expansion calculations carried out by pelissetto et al . and calabrese et al .",
    "support the existence of the continuous phase transition in these systems.@xcite also , most of experiments seem to be in accordance with the continuous transition.@xcite however , the former point of view is quite intriguing , since it implies that the phase transition of the 2d quantum version of these systems at @xmath10 may be the ( quantum ) fluctuation - driven first order type .",
    "although the quantum second order phase transition and the related quantum critical phenomena have been comprehensively explored so far,@xcite long - wavelength properties which emerge near the quantum fluctuation - driven first order transition have not been clarified sufficiently .",
    "it is well - known that in the case of the continuous quantum phase transition , critical phenomena just above the transition point at @xmath10 are described by a renormalized 2d classical theory .",
    "in contrast , it is highly non - trivial how quantum and thermal fluctuations which induce a first order transition at zero temperature affect low - energy behaviors ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : schpha ] ) . in this paper , we would like to address this issue for the 2d quantum triangular haf .    generally , in 2d quantum critical phenomena , the crossover from the 2 + 1d quantum behaviors to the renormalized 2d classical ones occurs at finite temperatures . for the precise description of the quantum - classical crossover",
    ", a promising theoretical approach may be the non - perturbative renormalization group ( rg ) method .",
    "this technique has been applied to classical frustrated magnets by delamotte et al .",
    "yielding fruitful results.@xcite they showed that the non - perturbative rg method successfully reproduces the rg equations for both the four - dimensional ( 4d ) ginzuburg - landau - wilson ( glw ) model and the 2d nonlinear sigma model , which are the effective field theories for the 4d and 2d classical triangular haf , respectively , and is expected to capture correct low - energy physics of the 3d triangular haf .",
    "thus , the non - perturbative rg method may be suitable for the investigation of the dimensional ( or quantum - to - classical ) crossover phenomena for these systems .",
    "we utilize this remarkable merit of the approach to shed light on how quantum and thermal fluctuations control low - energy properties in the vicinity of quantum fluctuation - driven first order transitions .",
    "our main results are as follows . at finite temperatures , the crossover from a quantum @xmath1 model to a renormalized 2d classical system appears , and as @xmath11 decreases ,",
    "long - wavelength behaviors are almost governed by the @xmath1-fluctuations which eventually bring about the first order transition .",
    "also , it is found that in this crossover region , thermodynamic properties are effectively determined by gapless excitations _ a la _ spin waves with a linear dispersion .",
    "the presence of these low - lying excitations explains partly the experimental observations for niga@xmath2s@xmath3 ; i.e. the quadratic @xmath11-dependence of the specific heat coefficient , and the finite @xmath11-independent uniform spin susceptibility at low temperatures.@xcite    the organization of this paper is as follows . in sec.ii , the effective field theory and the formulation of the non - perturbative rg method are given .",
    "in sec.iii , we present results on the rg flows obtained by solving numerically the rg equations , which demonstrate the existence of strong fluctuations driving the phase transition at @xmath10 to the first order type . in sec.iv , we show that in the crossover region , quasi - gaussian fluctuations dominate low - energy properties , and derive low-@xmath11 behaviors of the specific heat coefficient and the uniform spin susceptibility .",

    "the vertical and horizontal axes are , respectively , temperature @xmath11 and a parameter @xmath12 which controls quantum fluctuations.,width=226 ]",
    "quantum phase transitions in two dimension which occur at @xmath10 can not be described by the usual @xmath13-type ginzburg - landau scheme , since the long - range ordered phase exists only at @xmath10 , and the order parameter becomes nonzero abruptly just at @xmath10 . in the case of 2d quantum non - frustrated haf , the low - energy properties of the quantum phase transition",
    "are successfully explained in terms of the @xmath14 nonlinear sigma model.@xcite in the derivation of the nonlinear sigma model from the haf , one merely postulates that the correlation length is larger than the lattice constant .",
    "thus the model describes long - wavelength physics of both the ordered phase at @xmath10 and the disordered phase above the transition temperature , which are mainly governed by transverse fluctuations _ a la _ spin waves .",
    "the nonlinear sigma model is suitable for the description of the 2d quantum phase transition in which the order parameter amplitude is almost frozen , but the strong transverse fluctuations destroy the lro at finite temperatures .",
    "the extension of the nonlinear sigma model approach to the 2d quantum triangular haf was achieved by dombre and read , and azaria et al.@xcite the order parameter for this case is expressed by a matrix with @xmath0 symmetry , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is an @xmath14 vector .",
    "the @xmath14 symmetry reflects the spin rotational symmetry .",
    "the @xmath17 symmetry comes from the @xmath18 representation of the @xmath19 symmetry of the triangular lattice , which is enlarged to @xmath17 in the continuum limit.@xcite these vectors obey the non - linear conditions , @xmath20 , @xmath21 corresponding to the 120@xmath22 structure ordered state .",
    "subsequently , however , it was recognized that the @xmath0 non - linear sigma model in three dimension is not a proper low - energy theory for the classical stacked triangular haf , because the model neglects totally longitudinal ( amplitude ) fluctuation modes , which importantly induce a fluctuation - driven first order transition.@xcite this fact implies that the 2d quantum version of the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model fails to capture the important low - energy physics at @xmath10 .",
    "to improve the model , one needs to introduce an effective potential which replaces the above nonlinear condition with the relaxed constraints .",
    "then , the correct low - energy effective theory for 2d quantum triangular haf is given by the @xmath0 matrix ginzburg - landau - wilson ( glw ) model , of which the action is given by , @xmath23 @xmath24 , \\label{ss}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath25,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath26 , \\label{s6}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath27 the inverse temperature , and @xmath28 @xmath29 here , @xmath30 , @xmath31 .",
    "the model ( [ model ] ) describes two massless excitations with the velocity @xmath32 , and a massless excitation with the velocity , @xmath33 as well as a massive excitation with the mass @xmath34 , and two massive excitations with the mass @xmath35 the three massless excitations are , respectively , two out - of - plane modes and one in - plane mode of transverse fluctuations _ a la _ spin waves .",
    "the second part @xmath36 is an effective potential which imposes the released non - linear conditions on @xmath37 . in the limit of @xmath38 , @xmath39",
    ", @xmath36 recovers the strict nonlinear conditions , and @xmath40 becomes equivalent to the action of the @xmath0 nonlinear sigma model.@xcite the release of the constraint allows the existence of the three massive longitudinal fluctuation modes . the classical version of the model @xmath40 has been extensively studied so far.@xcite here we also consider the 6-body part @xmath41 which is required for the correct description of the fluctuation - driven first order transition . in the expression of @xmath41 , we neglect terms with derivatives , because the scaling dimensions of these terms imply that they are irrelevant .",
    "although in the following our analysis is applied to non - perturbative regions including the strong coupling limit , we believe that the omission of the 6-body terms with derivatives would not change the essential features of our results .",
    "then , since any polynomials of @xmath42 which preserve the @xmath43 symmetry are expressed in terms of @xmath44 and @xmath45,@xcite 6-body terms are generally given by eq.([s6 ] ) . the effective field theory ( [ model ] )",
    "captures low - energy physics of the 2d quantum triangular haf in the vicinity of the long - range ordered state with the 120@xmath46 structure , which are governed by both quantum and thermal fluctuations .",
    "the 120@xmath22 structure state is expressed by the configuration of @xmath47 which minimizes @xmath48 , i.e. @xmath49 .",
    "transverse and longitudinal spin fluctuations around this configuration which preserve relative angles between spins on a primitive triangle are included in the model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "it is noted that although the condition @xmath49 leads the finite amplitude of the order parameter , the model is also applicable to the disordered phase at finite temperatures , since in 2d systems transverse fluctuations for @xmath50 are so strong that the average magnetization vanishes even under this condition , in accordance with the mermin - wagner - coleman theorem.@xcite this is a key feature of the nonlinear sigma model as an effective field theory for the 2d quantum phase transition at @xmath10 .",
    "we would like to stress again that any perturbative approaches for the glw model ( [ model ] ) can not describe the 2d quantum phase transition properly because of the reason explained above , and a theoretical framework which can interpolate the nonlinear sigma model and the glw model is required .",
    "the non - perturbative rg method is most suitable for this purpose , as will be explained in the following sections .",
    "we apply the non - perturbative rg method to the model ( [ model ] ) .",
    "this approach was developed by wetterich , zumbach , and delamotte et al . for classical matrix glw models in connection with",

    "we exploit this fascinating advantage of the non - perturbative rg method in the following .",

    "to explain this point , we would like to note that in our field - theoretical model , chirality domains , which inevitably exist in real triangular haf and suppress the development of the magnetic correlation length , are not included .",
    "also , as was pointed out by kawamura and miyashita@xcite , @xmath149 vortex , which is not taken into account explicitly in the field - theoretical model , may play a crucial role at finite temperatures , disturbing the growth of @xmath150.@xcite it is expected that the velocities of the magnetic excitations , @xmath151 , are strongly renormalized by these topological defects , and reduced to small values .",
    "then , as long as @xmath152 , the magnetic excitations behave like gapless , and our results may be applicable .",
    "indeed , the experimental observation ( b ) intimates the existence of gapless magnetic excitations . also , to interpret the experimental observations ( b ) and ( c ) in a consistent way , one might need to consider effects of randomness such as impurities , which are beyond the scope of this paper , but may play a crucial role in connection with the topological defects inherent in triangular haf . to confirm this speculation , we need further studies .",
    "we would like to address this issue in the near future .",
    "the author is indebted to b. delamotte , h. kawamura , s. nakatsuji , and h. tsunetsugu for useful discussions .",
