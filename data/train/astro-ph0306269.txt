    "the commissioning year of the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; york et al .",
    "2000 ) , which was released as the early data release ( edr ; stoughton et al . 2002 ) , showed the potential for scientific discoveries across a variety of disciplines . for the field of cataclysmic variables ( cvs ) , sdss is able to find many new cvs , especially those with faint magnitudes that were missed in previous surveys with brighter limits ( szkody et al .",
    "2002 ; paper i ) .",
    "this provides a more accurate picture of the true population of cvs , without the bias of a sample based on high accretion luminosity , and enables the study of the systems which have evolved to the shortest orbital periods and thereby have the lowest mass transfer rates ( howell , rappaport & politano 1997 ) .",
    "the sdss photometry provides accurate magnitudes , colors and positions , and the spectroscopy usually allows unambiguous identification from the strong hydrogen balmer and helium emission lines that are the typical signatures of mass transfer in a close binary .",
    "paper i reported 19 new discoveries from the spectra obtained through december 31 , 2000 , including high inclination systems , novalikes and those suspected of harboring magnetic white dwarfs ( see warner 1995 for a complete description of all types of cvs ) .",
    "this paper provides information on an additional 42 cvs found from sdss spectra obtained through 2001 december 31 .",
    "of these 42 , seven are previously known cvs from prior x - ray , optical , and radio surveys , 3 were previously known objects but not classified as cvs , and 32 are new discoveries .",
    "followup observations on a number of these systems include photometric light curves , time - resolved spectroscopy and polarimetry .",
    "the resulting analysis allows us to provide a determination of the orbital period , inclination , and magnetic field for several of the cvs .",
    "the sdss imaging and spectroscopic instrumentation and reductions are explained in detail in paper i and in the papers by fukugita et al .",

    "is used to select objects by color for later spectroscopy in the range of 3900 - 6200  ( blue beam ) and 5800 - 9200  ( red beam ) at a resolving power of @xmath21800 .",
    "the spectra are wavelength and flux - calibrated and corrected for absorption bands , then classified as stars , galaxies and quasars .",
    "the resulting spectra can then be searched by category , redshift or spectral characteristics .    as explained in paper",
    "i , the selection criteria by color ( @xmath3 and @xmath4 ) for the cv category primarily provide spectra of wd+m binaries , some of which are low mass transfer cvs where the underlying stars dominate the light .",
    "in addition , the color selection for quasars and very blue objects provide spectra of the blue cvs that are disk or white dwarf dominated .",
    "a manual search of all the spectra for emission line objects at zero redshift resulted in the identification of the 42 cvs listed in table 1 .",
    "this list includes the objects that will be in data release 1 ( dr1 ) as well as several others that were found on additional plates taken in 2001 .",
    "the magnitudes and colors are from the psf photometry and have not been corrected for reddening .",
    "figure 1 shows the locations of the 42 cvs in sdss color - color plots along with the stellar locus .    during 2001",
    ", we also conducted follow - up observations to refine the nature of the cvs that were being discovered .",
    "photometry was accomplished using the university of washington 0.76 m telescope at manastash ridge observatory ( mro ) , using a 1024@xmath51024 ccd and a harris v filter and also with the u.s .",
    "naval observatory flagstaff station ( nofs ) 1 m r / c telescope , using a 2048@xmath52048 site / tektronix ccd .",
    "the magnitudes were measured using the iraf task @xmath6 and a light curve was constructed from differential magnitudes with respect to comparison stars on each frame . in order to obtain the highest time resolution with the nofs , no filter was used .",
    "the nofs ccd has a wide - band response that falls between johnson v and cousins r , but is somewhat closer to a v response . from separate nights of calibrated all - sky",
    "photometry using landolt standards , the johnson b and v magnitudes of the comparison stars were calibrated and used to place the photometry of the sdss sources onto the johnson v magnitude system .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy was done at the 3.5 m telescope at apache point observatory ( apo ) with the double imaging spectrograph in high resolution mode ( resolution about 3 ) and a 1.5 arcsec slit .",
    "blue and red spectra were obtained on all nights except for 2002 may 9 , when only the red spectrograph was available .",
    "the reductions were identical to those of paper i and details are provided in that reference . for the objects with sufficient time coverage to determine a radial velocity curve ,",
    "velocities were measured with either the  e \" or ",
    "k \" routines in the iraf @xmath7 package ( for simple or narrow line structure ) or with the double - gaussian method ( shafter 1983 ) .",
    "sinusoidal fits to these velocities were then used to determine @xmath8 ( systemic velocity ) , k ( semi - amplitude ) , p ( orbital period ) and @xmath9 ( phase of crossing from red to blue ) .    additionally , the spectropolarimeter spol was used on the 2.2 m telescope at steward observatory ( so ) to measure the circular polarization of a few sources to determine if they were magnetic cvs .",
    "the dates and type of followup observations are summarized in table 2 .",
    "for convenience , throughout the rest of this paper , we will abbreviate the names to sdsshhmm ( except for the 2 sources which have identical first 4 coordinates of 1258 so we add the degrees of declination to the name to differentiate the two ) .",
    "the coordinates are accurate enough to identify the objects easily on the digitized sky survey .",
    "the few objects that have close companions on the sky are identified as notes to the table .",

    "rz leo , on the other hand , shows strongly doubled lines and broad absorption surrounding the emission lines , which indicates the white dwarf , rather than an accretion disk , is contributing much of the blue light .",

    "they measured the velocities using a single gaussian fit to the entire line that resulted in a noisy radial velocity curve .",
    "as the lines are clearly not gaussian ( figure 3 ) , we attempted a better solution by using the double - gaussian method on the line wings , using the mt01 period . with a gaussian width of 100 km s@xmath10 and a separation of 2000 km s@xmath10 , our solution results in a larger k amplitude ( table 4 ) and a smoother radial velocity curve ( figure 4 ) .",

    "this is consistent with the magnitude differences in the two data sets ( j00 give a b magnitude of 16.1 whereas the sdss photometry is 17.0 in g ) .",
    "the lower flux results in changes in the line emission and the domination of the secondary over the accretion disk in the red ( see section 3.5 ) . since both the hamburg survey and the usno - a2.0 magnitudes are consistent with the brighter fluxes , while the sdss and apo spectra are consistent with the fainter magnitudes , this system either has large variations of mass transfer on long timescales or a large orbital flux variation .",
    "the followup apo time - resolved spectra over 2.3 hrs show a one magnitude change in the continuum over this interval ( figure 5 ) , which argues for an orbital variation .",
    "the radial velocity curve curves of both h@xmath11 and h@xmath12 ( figure 6 , table 4 ) indicate an orbital period near 3.25 hrs , but a longer data set will be needed to pin this down precisely .",
    "it is unusual to have an object in the 3 - 4 hr period range that has a low enough @xmath13 to show the underlying stars , as most systems in this period range are high mass transfer objects with prominent accretion disks ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "in addition , the shape and phasing of the continuum light curve ( figure 5 ) is inconsistent with either an eclipse ( which would have minimum light near phase 0 ) or a hot spot coming into view ( which would have maximum light near phase 0.8 ) .",

    "thus , this object is likely to be a low inclination , high mass transfer rate novalike system with a bright accretion disk .",
    "_ sdss2258 : _",
    "sdss2258 was also previously identified as a blue star ( pb 7412 ) in the bf84 survey and then classified as an emission line object in the hk survey of beers et al .",

    "photometry of sdss1137 ( rz leo ) by howell & szkody ( 1988 ) and mt01 has shown a large orbital modulation but no eclipses .",
    "followup photometry on sdss0407 , sdss0920 and sdss1327 reveals eclipses in these 3 systems while time - resolved spectroscopy provides the radial velocities as well as the periods ( tables 2 and 4 ) .",

    "photometry with better time resolution is needed to search for possible eclipses .",
    "as mentioned in paper i , there are 3 epochs of observation for all sdss spectral sources to determine if there are large magnitude changes related to a dwarf nova outburst or to changes from low to high mass transfer states in novalikes .",
    "these include the sdss photometric epoch , the sdss spectral epoch and the digitized sky survey ( dss ) epoch .",
    "a dwarf nova outburst can be distinguished from the high state of a novalike by the spectral appearance , as a dwarf nova at outburst shows broad absorption lines ( from the thick disk ) , while a novalike at a high state usually shows an enhancement of all emission , especially the high excitation lines of ( warner 1995 ) .",
    "sdss0310 : _ of the objects in table 1 , we can identify sdss0310 as a bona - fide dwarf nova , as the sdss photometry and the apo followup spectra caught it at outburst ( figure 15 ) , while the sdss spectrum ( figure 2 ) was at quiescence .",

    ". however , sufficient followup data are not yet available to confirm the nature of these sources .",
    "the presence of strong emission lines often signifies a magnetic white dwarf , as they arise from the ionization of the accretion column(s ) by the euv continuum of a radial accretion shock .",

    "apo spectra over half the orbit give a radial velocity solution ( table 4 ) with a relatively low k of 90 km s@xmath10 ( figure 19 ) .",
    "spectropolarimetry at the 2.3 m bok telescope ( figure 20 ) confirms the polar nature , with the broadband circular polarization varying between + 2% and + 28% over the 2 hr period of the observations .",
    "the constant sign of circular polarization indicates that we see only one accretion pole through the orbit , while the rather weakly modulated h@xmath12 flux and modest radial velocity amplitude suggest a rather low inclination . in figure 20",
    "it is clear that the light curve variation is due to a changing continuum shape , from rising slightly to the blue in the first spectrum , to being strongly convex upward for the next few observations , and returning to the initial shape by the end of the sequence .",
    "because these variations correlate with the changing circular polarization , both are taken to arise from the beaming pattern of cyclotron emission . in the coadded polarization spectrum ( figure 21 ) ,",
    "diffuse absorption features can be recognized near 6100  and between h@xmath11 and @xmath144686 . interpreting these as zeeman features of h@xmath12 and h@xmath11 , respectively ,",

    "it will take larger telescopes to determine the nature of the faintest cvs being found .",
    "however , by the end of the sdss survey , we should have a clearer picture of the range of parameters and the distribution of types of cvs in the galaxy , including both high and low accretion rate systems .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge michael strauss and patrick hall for pointing out some of the cv candidates and don schneider for useful comments on the manuscript .",

    "<S> while most of the sdss discovered systems are faint ( @xmath0 18th mag ) with low accretion rates ( as implied from their spectral characteristics ) , there are also a few bright objects which may have escaped previous surveys due to changes in the mass transfer rate . </S>"
