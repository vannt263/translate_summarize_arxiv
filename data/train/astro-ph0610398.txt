    "the inflationary scenario , whereby the universe underwent a phase of accelerated expansion in its most distant past , represents the cornerstone of modern , early universe cosmology @xcite .",
    "it has proved remarkably successful when confronted with cosmological observations , in particular the three - year data from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( wmap3 ) @xcite .",
    "string theory is presently the favoured candidate for a unified theory of the fundamental interactions including gravity and it is therefore important to embed inflation within string theory .",
    "one approach to string - theoretic inflation is based on @xmath1-branes @xcite . of particular interest",
    "are scenarios where a type iib orientifold is compactified on a calabi - yau ( cy ) three - fold , where the moduli fields are stabilized due to the presence of non - trivial flux @xcite .",
    "( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "these fluxes generate local regions within the cy space with a warped geometry or ` throat ' . in many settings ,",
    "an anti-@xmath2-brane sits naturally at the infra - red ( ir ) tip of the throat and attracts a @xmath2-brane towards it .",
    "the brane separation then plays the role of the inflaton and , since this is an open string mode , its dynamics is determined by a dirac - born - infeld ( dbi ) action . in general , there are two limiting regimes for brane inflation which are characterized by the rolling of the inflaton . in the kklmmt scenario , for example , the inflaton undergoes conventional slow - roll down a flat potential @xcite .",
    "however , the non - linear nature of the dbi action implies that inflation may also proceed when the field is rolling relatively fast , as is the case in dbi inflation @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate how the brane inflationary scenario could be tested if forthcoming observations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) uncover non - gaussian statistics in the scalar ( density ) perturbation spectrum and also a primordial background of tensor ( gravitational wave ) perturbations . an observed departure from purely gaussian statistics",
    "will provide a powerful discriminant between different inflationary models and the planck satellite , which is scheduled for launch in 2007 , will improve on the wmap3 sensitivity by an order of magnitude @xcite . on the other hand , the detection of gravitational waves will open up a direct window onto the energy scale of inflation .",
    "the most promising means of detecting tensor perturbations is through the @xmath3-mode polarization of the cmb and a number of experiments , such as clover ( the ` cl - observer ' ) @xcite , are presently under construction .",
    "( for a review , see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we begin by summarizing the brane inflation scenario in section 2 . in section 3 ,",
    "we derive a consistency condition between the non - gaussianity of the curvature perturbation and the amplitude and scale - dependence of the gravitational waves .",
    "this relation is independent of the warped geometry and the inflaton potential .",
    "we then discuss the prospects for testing such a condition with future cmb polarization experiments . in section 4",
    ", we consider the class of models where the observable phase of inflation occurred when the @xmath1-brane was near the ir tip of the throat .",
    "we derive a further consistency condition in this regime that relates the scalar spectral index , the tensor - scalar ratio and the bispectrum of the curvature perturbation .",
    "we find that such a constraint leads to a bound on the gravitational wave amplitude of @xmath0 , which is in the range of sensitivity of the next generation of cmb polarization experiments .",
    "we conclude with a discussion in section 6 .",
    "in general , the low energy world - volume dynamics of a probe @xmath2-brane in a warped background is given by @xmath4   \\\\ \\label{defp } p ( \\phi , x ) = f_1(\\phi ) \\sqrt{1+f_2 ( \\phi ) x } -f_3 ( \\phi )    , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath5 is the ricci curvature scalar , @xmath6 is the kinetic energy of the inflaton field , @xmath7 , and the functions @xmath8 are determined by the warped geometry and the inflaton self - interaction potential .",
    "a concrete example of a warped background is the klebanov - strassler ( ks ) solution of the type iib theory , where the throat is a warped deformed conifold @xcite .",
    "the ten - dimensional metric has the form @xmath9 , where @xmath10 denotes the warp factor and @xmath11 is the coordinate along the throat ( corresponding to one of the coordinates on @xmath12 ) . in the ultra - violet ( uv ) regime ( @xmath13 )",
    "the throat corresponds to a cone over the einstein manifold @xmath14 , which has a topology @xmath15 , where the @xmath16 is fibred over the @xmath17 . on the other hand , at the tip of the throat ( @xmath18 ) the wrapping of the fluxes along the cycles of the conifold smooths out the conical singularity with an @xmath17",

    "since the aim of this paper is to identify model - independent , observational tests of brane inflation that are insensitive to the specific form of the inflaton potential and the nature of the warped geometry , we will assume that the form of the kinetic function @xmath24 is given by eq .",
    "( [ defp ] ) for arbitrary @xmath25 , subject only to the condition that a successful phase of inflation can be realised .",
    "we will exploit the fact that the non - trivial kinetic structure in @xmath24 causes the sound speed of fluctuations in the inflaton to differ from unity ( the value it takes in canonical , single - field inflation , where @xmath26 ) .",
    "this will lead to observational signatures involving both non - gaussianity and gravitational waves .",
    "the friedmann equations derived from action ( [ action ] ) take the form @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 represents the hubble parameter , a dot denotes @xmath30 and a comma denotes a partial derivative .",
    "the inflationary dynamics for this class of models can be quantified in terms of three ` slow - roll ' parameters : @xmath31 where @xmath32 defines the sound speed , @xmath33 .",
    "the rate of change of the sound speed is determined by @xmath34 and we will assume throughout that @xmath35 during the observable phase of inflation .",
    "the amplitudes of the scalar and tensor perturbation spectra are given by @xmath36 respectively , and the corresponding spectral indices are @xcite @xmath37 the tensor - scalar ratio , @xmath38 , is directly related to the tensorial spectral index such that @xcite @xmath39    finally , deviations from purely gaussian statistics arise when the primordial three - point function for the curvature perturbation is non - trivial .",
    "it is conventional to write the non - gaussian curvature perturbation @xmath40 as a sum of a gaussian part and the square of a gaussian such that @xmath41 , where the quadratic part is a convolution and @xmath42 defines the ` non - linearity ' parameter @xcite . in general , this parameter is a function of the three momenta which form a triangle in fourier space .",
    "recently , it was shown that in the equilateral triangle limit ( where the three momenta have equal magnitude ) , the leading - order contribution to the non - linearity parameter is given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 the bound on the non - linearity parameter imposed by wmap3 is @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it was observed in @xcite that when @xmath46 , the second term on the right - hand side of eq .",
    "( [ deffnl ] ) vanishes , i.e. , @xmath47 it can be further shown that for arbitrary @xmath48 , eq . ( [ defp ] ) is the most general form of the kinetic function @xmath24 which satisfies eq .",
    "( [ vanish ] ) .",
    "specifically , we may employ the definitions ( [ defcs ] ) and ( [ deflambda ] ) to express eq .",
    "( [ vanish ] ) in the form of a third - order , non - linear partial differential equation : @xmath49 however , eq . ( [ pde ] ) can be reduced to the first - order equation @xmath50 by defining a new variable @xmath51 .",

    "twice then yields the general solution for @xmath24 , which is precisely the form given in eq .",
    "( [ defp ] ) , where the @xmath25 arise as arbitrary integration functions .",
    "it follows , therefore , that for the general class of string - theoretic models ( [ defp ] ) , the leading - order contribution to the non - linearity parameter is determined entirely by the sound speed : @xmath54 this implies that we may substitute eq .",

( [ departure ] ) is model - independent in the sense that it holds for an arbitrary inflaton potential and a general warping of the higher - dimensional spacetime . this is important since the precise form of the potential depends on non - perturbative features of the superpotential , whereas the warp factor is determined by the details of the flux compactification .",
    "we may therefore regard eq .",
    "( [ departure ] ) as a robust prediction for string - theoretic brane inflation and it is natural to investigate whether it could be employed as a future test of the scenario . since it formally reduces to the standard consistency equation of slow - roll inflation in the limit @xmath56 , a detection of eq .",

    "we focus on the case where the @xmath1-brane is in the vicinity of the ir tip of the warped throat . to date ,",
    "the majority of studies into dbi inflation have considered the dynamics of the brane when it is far from the tip and in a region where the throat is asymptotically @xmath74 @xcite . however , in the uv version of dbi inflation , the brane moves into the throat and reheating occurs when it reaches the tip . since the era of inflation that is accessible to observations occurred during the last 30 - 60 e - folds , the brane may well have been near the tip of the throat during that epoch .",

    "such a spectrum is favoured by the wmap3 data @xcite .",
    "secondly , since the observed deviations from a scale - invariant spectrum are small , it also predicts that a large non - gaussian contribution to the curvature perturbation will be accompanied by a small tensor - scalar ratio , and vice - versa . as a result , we should not expect to simultaneously observe both a sizeable non - gaussian signal and a gravitational wave background in these models . on the other hand ,",
    "if a departure from pure scale - invariance is confirmed , the present - day upper limit on @xmath42 will impose a _ lower _",
    "limit on @xmath60 , and vice - versa .    in view of this ,",

    "for example , the relative steepness of the dot - dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig3brane ] implies that if ( as expected ) the spectral index is ultimately measured to a very high accuracy , a confirmed detection of the non - linearity parameter ( regardless of the error in the measurement ) will strongly constrain the tensor - scalar ratio .",

    "the existence of such a lower limit on @xmath60 is of particular interest given that future space - based cmb polarization experiments with current detector technology and full sky coverage should be able to detect @xmath115 at the @xmath73-sigma level @xcite .    finally , we have also superimposed fig .",

    "will only be observable with future all - sky cmb experiments in the region above this line and , since it lies in the region of parameter space that is inconsistent with the wmap3 upper limit ( [ boundone ] ) , a detection of primordial non - gaussianity by planck will immediately imply that the tensor - scalar ratio will be too small for the consistency equation ( [ departure ] ) to be detectable .",
    "consequently , an observed violation of the standard consistency equation would rule out this class of models .",
    "there exist many compactification solutions in string theory and it is therefore important to identify observational constraints and tests of string - theoretic inflation that are insensitive to our universe s location in the string landscape . in this paper , we have considered this question within the context of possible non - gaussian and gravitational wave signatures from brane inflationary scenarios , both for an arbitrary warp factor and for the case where the warp factor is approximately constant .",
    "furthermore , the form of the inflaton potential has remained unspecified throughout .",
    "the constraints we have discussed are also independent of whether the brane is moving into or out of the throat and therefore apply to both the uv and ir versions of dbi inflation @xcite . however , we have only considered radial motion of the brane in the throat , and have ignored fluctuations of the brane in its internal angular directions . as was emphasized recently @xcite , such fluctuations may generate a significant contribution to the curvature perturbation .",

    "the magnitude of the correction depends on the non - linearity parameter , @xmath42 .",

    "( [ mainresult ] ) also provides insight into why it has proved difficult to construct brane inflation models with both a high tensor - scalar ratio and a large non - gaussian contribution to the curvature perturbation @xcite .",
    "indeed , the bound ( [ boundtwo ] ) implies that any model which predicts a very low gravitational wave amplitude ( @xmath122 ) will generate a non - gaussianity in excess of the wmap3 limit unless the spectral index is extremely close to unity .",
    "consequently , the constraint ( [ boundtwo ] ) may be employed to rule out specific models without needing to explicitly calculate the level of non - gaussianity .    as an example , let us consider the scenario discussed recently by panda _",
    "@xcite , where inflation is generated by the radial motion of a probe bps @xmath123-brane in the presence of a stack of coincident and static bps @xmath124-branes .",

    "<S> we study brane inflation scenarios in a warped throat geometry and show that there exists a consistency condition between the non - gaussianity of the curvature perturbation and the amplitude and scale - dependence of the primordial gravitational waves . </S>",
    "<S> this condition is independent of the warping of the throat and the form of the inflaton potential . </S>",
    "<S> we find that such a relation could be tested by a future cmb polarization experiment if the planck satellite is able to detect both a gravitational wave background and a non - gaussian statistic . in models where the observable stage of inflation occurs when the brane is in the tip region of the throat , </S>",
    "<S> we derive a further consistency condition involving the scalar spectral index , the tensor - scalar ratio and the curvature perturbation bispectrum . </S>",
    "<S> we show that when such a relation is combined with the wmap3 results , it leads to a model - independent bound on the gravitational wave amplitude given by @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to the range of sensitivity of the next generation of cmb polarization experiments . </S>"
