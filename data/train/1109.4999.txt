    "at the end of the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) intermediate mass stars go through an intense mass - loss phase when 50 - 90% of their mass is expelled and expands in a nebula surrounding the core of the star . after the loss of the envelope , the agb star contracts and heats up , ionising the nebula ejected during the agb phase , which shines as a planetary nebula ( pn ) .",
    "the reason for the dramatic increase in mass - loss during the late agb phase is not well known .",
    "agb stars appear to lose mass spherically , but the pne that result from the mass - loss primarily have non - spherical morphologies .",
    "it is likely that the mechanism that causes the heavy agb mass loss is related to the mechanism that dictates the ejecta s departure from sphericity .",
    "binarity may be an effective way to break spherical symmetry and to stimulate mass - loss .",
    "some fundamental and rapid change in structure must occur between the spherical agb mass - loss phase and the non - spherical , collimated pn phase ( ) .",
    "disks around evolved stars have been observed and are suspected to play a fundamental role in the shapes of pne ( e.g. huggins 2007 ) .",
    "theoretical work envisions their role as the collimating agent for non - spherical mass - loss ( e.g. soker & livio 1994 , blackman et al . 2001 ) . by studying the characteristics of these disks we can understand the engine that is forming the pne . only with the very large telescope interferometer ( vlti )",
    "can we reach high enough spatial resolution to measure the parameters of the inner circumstellar environment of post - agb stars , in transition between the agb and the pn phase .",
    "these parameters will meaningfully constrain single - star as well as binary models of agb mass - loss and nebulae collimation .",
    "some pne are found to harbour compact disks .",
    "for example , disks have been observed with the vlti in two young pne , m2 - 9 and mz 3 ( lykou et al .",
    "2011 , chesneau et al .",
    "these disks are compact toroids with an inner radius @xmath0 10 au , but contain much less mass than their surrounding pne , with the total dust mass in the disk @xmath0 10@xmath1  m@xmath2 ( lykou et al .",
    "2011 , corradi et al 2011 , chesneau et al .",
    "the disks found in these pne contain amorphous silicate grains , which implies a young age .",
    "in addition , m2 - 9 has a binary companion with a period of @xmath0 90 years ( lykou et al .",
    "2011 , corradi et al .",
    "although a binary has not been detected in mz 3 , it is believed to exist with a similar period , due to its overall similarity to m2 - 9 .",
    "finally , it must be noted that both of these pne may actually be pne mimics ( frew and parker et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "another two young pne , cpd-56@xmath38032 ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* de marco et al . 2002 ) ) and m2 - 29 , also had disks detected in their cores . however , their properties are very different than those of m2 - 9 and mz 3 .",
    "the compact disks have an inner radius @xmath0100 au .",
    "the disk mass is @xmath0 10@xmath4  m@xmath2 for cpd-56@xmath38032 and @xmath0 10@xmath5  m@xmath2 for m2 - 29 ( chesneau et al .",
    "2006 , gesicki et al .",
    "2010 , miszalski et al .",
    "in addition , the disks found in these pne both contain dual - dust chemistry ( o and c rich ) .",
    "no known binary exists for cpd-56@xmath38032 , but a binary in m2 - 29 with a period of @xmath0 17 years is likely ( hajduk et al .",
    "2008 ) .",
    "looking to the post - agb objects , which are closer on the evolutionary phase to when the disks were likely formed , we find two categories of objects : 1 ) naked post - agb objects and 2 ) pre - pne .",
    "naked post - agb stars tend to not have a reflection nebulae , and as such are not thought to evolve into pne ( the exceptions are hd44179 and hr 4049 , see section 2.2.2 ) .",
    "while we call them  naked \" because they lack nebulosity , the seds of these stars actually show a larger ir - excess at near / mid infrared wavelengths , indicating the presence of a compact disk ( de ruyter et al .",
    "several of these disks have been observed with the vlti and have an inner radius of @xmath015 au at 8 @xmath6 m and with dust masses of @xmath01x10@xmath7  m@xmath2 ( e.g. deroo et al 2007 , deroo et al 2006 ) .",
    "no expansion of the dust has been detected , implying that the dust is gravitationally bound in a keplarian rotation .",
    "the keplerian rotation indicates that it is likely a relic of a strong interaction phase when the primary was an agb giant and indicates that a binary companion to the post - agb star is likely present .",
    "such companions were eventually found with orbital periods between 100 and 2000 days ( van winckel et al .",
    "finally , the disks in the naked post - agb stars exhibit strong crystalline silicate features .",
    "this suggests that the disks found around naked post - agb stars are actually older than the disks in some young pne as the dust is more processed .",
    "some post - agb stars , known as pre - pne , have collimated nebulae shining in the optical by reflected light or shock ionisation which are thought to become pne .",
    "it is unknown why some , otherwise similar , post - agb stars have resolved nebulae while others do not .",
    "pre - pne are very similar to young pne and are extremely likely to be their immediate predecessors .",
    "the seds observed for many pre - pne are double peaked , indicative of a detached shell , others have a near - ir excess due to hot dust in the core ( lagadec et al .",
    "pre - pne do not appear to harbour close binaries although wider binaries may be present ( e.g. iras 22272 + 5435 appears to have @xmath8 22 year period , hrivnak et al .",
    "hd 44179 and hr 4049 are the only known pre - pne that have compact disks detected .",
    "however , they are unique in that they have both a naked post - agb - style disk ( keplarian rotation , @xmath010 au in diameter , with dual - dust chemistry , and a close binary companion with p @xmath0 300 - 400 days ; menshchikov et al .",
    "2002 , dominik et al .",
    "2003 , waelkens et al .",
    "1991 ) and a reflection nebula , thereby classifying them as pre - pne .",
    "therefore , we do not class hd 44179 or hr 4049 as typical pre - pn , but as  cross - over \" objects .",
    "we believe that the immediate circumstellar environments of pre - pne , primarily the disks that are found there , hold the key to the breaking of agb mass - loss symmetry which leads to collimated pn morphology .",
    "the basic questions that drive our research are : what type of disks , if any , exist inside typical pre - pne ?",
    "what is the connection between the older , post - agb keplerian disks and the lower - mass , toroidal disks around young pne ?",
    "are the disks a cause or a consequence of the asymmetric mass - loss ?",
    "the vlti has a spatial resolution up to 10 mas in the mid - ir ( using midi ) and up to 2 mas in the near - ir ( using amber ) , making it a powerful tool to observe the inner circumstellar regions of post - agb stars .",
    "the vlti allows us to determine the geometry and mass of a disk or any other structure present on the 10 -100  au scale .",
    "we have carefully selected eight pre - pne to observe with the vlti .",
    "each target has a bright , compact , unresolved or slightly resolved ( at the 0.3@xmath9 scale ) core in the mid - ir as seen from visir observations ( lagadec et al . 2011 ) .",
    "therefore , the chances of obtaining useful interferometric observations with the vlti are very high .",
    "all targets also have observed non - spherical nebulae around them .",
    "we expect to find disks that have affected the shaping of the pre - pne or that are a remnant of the shaping mechanism .",
    "likely , these disks will have different characteristics from the naked post - agb stars without a nebula .",
    "four of the eight pre - pne have already been observed ( from april - june 2011 ) .",
    "another four targets will be observed during november 2011 - april 2012 .",
    "we report preliminary results on iras 16279 - 4757 . iras",
    "16279 - 4757 is a complex axis - symmetric nebula located @xmath0 2 kpc away , with intermediate inclination to the line of sight .",
    "it is classified as a post - agb object based on its sed ( van der veen , habing and geballe 1989 ) .",
    "its optical spectrum suggests an inner star with spectral type of g5 ( hu et al .",
    "it has pahs and crystalline silicates similar to hd 44179 ( matsuura et al 2004 ) .",
    "we obtained 2 baselines of data with midi and 3 baselines with amber the resulting midi visibility curves show a sinusoidal pattern , indicating the presence of a ring - like disk ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "in addition , the visibility is high ( @xmath00.4 - 0.6 ) indicating the presence of a compact source in the centre .",
    "preliminary analysis of the visibility curves suggest the presence of a disk . one baseline observed a disk with an inner radius of @xmath0 150 au , while the second baseline observed a disk with an inner radius of @xmath0 70 au .",
    "this implies that the disk around iras 16279 - 4757 has an inner radius of @xmath0 150 au and we are viewing it at an inclination of @xmath060@xmath3 to the line of sight . this size is similar to the disks seen in young pne and larger than those observed around naked post - agb stars .",
    "additionally , the sinusoidal pattern seen in the visibility curves is very similar to the visibility curves observed by the vlti for the disk seen in cpd-56@xmath38032 ( see section 2.1 ) which has an inner radius of 97 @xmath10 11 au and an inclination of 28 @xmath10 7@xmath3 ( chesneau et al .",
    "the preliminary analysis of the amber observations indicates a 2-component source inside the disk found with the midi observations .",
    "the 2 components are likely a stellar source and a possible second disk inside the first disk with a radius of @xmath0 12 au .",
    "this second , smaller disk is similar in size to those around naked post - agb stars .",
    "iras 16279 - 4757 has shown that promising results can be found by searching for disks inside pre - pne with the vlti .",
    "more detailed radiative transfer models will be conducted to derive disk parameters such as inner and outer radii , scale - height , mass , and inclination .",
    "these models will be similar to the models for mz  3 and m2 - 9 ( e.g. lykou et al .",
    "2010 , chesneau et al .",
    "2007 ) . in conclusion ,",
    "observations with the vlti coupled with detailed modelling of the disks will lead to a quantified comparison between the physical properties of the disks which will allow us to study the evolutionary connection between the compact disks of naked post - agbs and the tenuous , larger disks inside young pne ."
