    "soliton solutions in non- or supersymmetric gauge theories at large-@xmath1 have been playing an important role to understand non - perturbative phenomena in qcd .",
    "a well - known example is the skyrme model and its soliton solutions , called skyrmions  @xcite .",
    "witten investigated mesons and glue states in the large-@xmath1 limit of qcd by a systematic expansion in powers of @xmath2 and showed that baryons emerge as solitons with mass of @xmath3  @xcite . in the successive papers",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the resultant effective theory is the skyrme model and skyrmions are interpreted as baryons  @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was found that domain wall solutions exist in large-@xmath1 susy gluodynamics ( sqcd )  @xcite as well as in non - susy qcd  @xcite .",
    "these walls behave as d - branes on which the string could end if they are bps saturated  @xcite .",
    "an interesting observation is that the wall width is @xmath4 and correspondingly heavy states are expected to emerge as solitons with mass of @xmath3  @xcite .    in this context",
    ", it may be natural to consider that solitons with mass of @xmath3 in sqcd could have something to do with skyrmions in the supersymmetric version of the skyrme model .",
    "the supersymmetric skyrme model was constructed in ref .",
    "the extension to supersymmetry restricts us to work on a @xmath5 target space rather than @xmath6 .",
    "the authors concluded that the possibility of the existence of soliton solutions is not excluded when the higher derivative terms are take into account .    in this paper",
    "we construct supersymmetric skyrmion solutions numerically . in the supersymmetric case ,",
    "the skyrme field equation is not second - order but fourth - order in derivatives . in general , higher derivative theories lack a lowest - energy state and exhibit runaway solutions along with physical solutions , which makes numerical computation unstable .",
    "the prescription was proposed by simon in ref .",
    "@xcite . according to his argument ,",
    "if higher - order derivative terms can be considered as a small perturbation , physical solutions should be taylor - expandable around the leading order solution .",
    "we shall apply this perturbation method to the supersymmetric skyrme field equation and obtain soliton solutions upto the second order in the coupling constant .",
    "the dependence of the skyrmion solutions on the coupling constant is also examined .",
