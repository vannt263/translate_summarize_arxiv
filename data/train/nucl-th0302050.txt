    "during the last 10 years much effort has been devoted to the study of the interaction of an @xmath0-meson with very light nuclei . the attention to this area , called primarily by the pioneering work of @xcite , arises from the distinctive features of the @xmath0-nuclear system at low energies . in more detail :    \\(i ) the @xmath4 interaction is characterized by the @xmath5 resonance located near zero @xmath4 kinetic energy . as a consequence ,",
    "the @xmath2-wave part of the @xmath4 interaction is attractive and rather large near threshold .",
    "this considerable attraction which is assumed to be coherently enhanced in nuclei has led to speculations about the existence of @xmath0-nuclear bound states which may be formed already in @xmath6 nuclei .",
    "although a calculation using an energy independent @xmath7 potential has confirmed this hypothesis @xcite , more sophisticated investigations  @xcite have shown that the @xmath4 interaction is unlikely to yield a bound @xmath1 system even with a relatively large real part of the scattering length @xmath8=0.75fm .",
    "the pole of the scattering amplitude `` recedes '' to the nonphysical sheet generating an @xmath2-wave virtual state .",
    "it is important that apparently the pole is located close to the scattering threshold , resulting in a strong influence on low - energy scattering and production processes with @xmath0-mesons .",
    "\\(ii ) concerning the formal aspects , the @xmath5 resonance , dominating the low - energy @xmath4 interaction , must distort the transparent connection between the @xmath4 and @xmath7 scattering amplitudes .",
    "this connection is well established in the pion - nuclear case within the local - density limit where the equivalent optical potential is related in a simple fashion to the elementary @xmath9 amplitude @xcite ( except for real absorption of pions on few - nucleon clusters ) .",
    "the physical basis of this fact , giving rise to the so - called impulse approximation of the optical potential , is a large internucleon separation distance compared to the range of the @xmath9 interaction . on the contrary , due to the resonance pole in the @xmath4 interaction ,",
    "the latter must be sizably influenced by the nuclear environment .",
    "indeed , using @xmath10 mev for the @xmath11(1535 ) width near the @xmath4 threshold , we obtain for the collision time @xmath12 which exceeds the time @xmath13 associated with the pion - exchange @xmath14 interaction .",
    "therefore , the validity of the simplest optical potential for the @xmath7 interaction is expected to be doubtful , and more rigorous models have to be used .",
    "the purpose of the present paper is to explore the interaction of @xmath0-mesons with three - body nuclei , a problem which can be solved exactly using methods developed within four - body scattering theory . at the same time",
    ", the generalization of the results obtained in this way to heavier nuclei seems to be more justifiable than in the deuteron case , where the two nucleons are strongly kinematically correlated and very weakly bound .",
    "our intention is to analyze the quality of the first - order optical potential for the @xmath1 interaction using as a reference the exact four - body calculation .",
    "since we have no way of direct fitting @xmath0-nuclear scattering cross sections using a phenomenological potential model , the information on the low - energy @xmath0-nuclear interaction stems entirely from the assumed properties of the @xmath4 interaction and depends strongly on the model linking these two processes .",
    "for this reason , a thorough microscopic approach to the @xmath0-nuclear dynamics becomes particularly important .",
    "on the other hand , rather complex mathematical infrastructure of the four - body scattering theory prevents to some extent a simple interpretation of the results .",
    "therefore , we first will clarify the question , whether the @xmath0-nuclear interaction can be adequately described in terms of the simplest optical potential .",
    "furthermore , the comparison of the four - body results with those obtained using less rigorous but very tractable approaches , such as the lowest - order optical potential , may be very fruitful in understanding the @xmath1 interaction mechanism .",
    "several aspects concerning the accuracy of the simplest optical model for the scattering of @xmath0 mesons on @xmath2-shell nuclei were already discussed in ref .",
    "in particular , it was shown that the behavior of the @xmath4 scattering matrix below the free threshold has a crucial influence on the results . here",
    "we address other questions related to the optical potential approach for @xmath1 scattering , namely : + ( i ) what is the influence of binding of the participating nucleon on the elementary scattering process ? + ( ii ) what is the relative importance of target excitations in between two successive scatterings on different nucleons ?",
    "+ ( iii ) what is the importance of the short - range behavior of the nucleon - nucleon potential ?",
    "the second part of the paper is devoted to coherent @xmath0-photoproduction on three - body nuclei @xmath15 these reactions are of special importance in @xmath0-nuclear physics .",
    "firstly , the main driving mechanism of @xmath0-photoproduction , the photoexcitation of the @xmath5-resonance , is well established .",
    "this is in contrast to reactions with nucleons as incident particles , where the main mechanism connected with the short - range part of the @xmath14 interaction is presumably much more complex and as of yet not well understood .",
    "secondly , the energy gap between the coherent and incoherent thresholds , where the @xmath0-yield is free from the strong incoherent background is about @xmath16 = 7 mev , which is appreciably larger than the one on the deuteron ( about 3 mev ) .",
    "this advantage has been partially used in a recent @xmath3he@xmath17he experiment carried out with the taps facility operating at mami @xcite .",
    "thirdly , the @xmath0-nuclear interaction , which is most important in the @xmath2-wave , must be particularly significant in reactions involving nuclei with nonzero spin . as a counter example",
    ", the reaction @xmath18he@xmath19he , where the @xmath2-wave in the final state is totally suppressed , does not show any strong influence of the final state interaction ( fsi ) .",
    "finally , the dynamics of the reactions ( [ eq5 ] ) may be treated within a few - body scattering theory , i.e. , formally exactly . though the near - threshold @xmath0-photoproduction on three - body nuclei was already considered in ref .",
    "@xcite within the so - called finite - rank - approximation ( fra ) , we reexamine it primarily in order to show the results of the four - body approach for the @xmath1 interaction in the final state .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "first , we briefly review in sect .",
    "[ sect1 ] the four - body formalism which is relevant for the present consideration . for the separable representation of the kernels we use the energy dependent pole expansion ( edpe ) method of ref .",
    "@xcite . in sect .",
    "[ sect2 ] , after a short summary of the kerman - mcmanus - thaler ( kmt ) theory , we discuss the `` standard '' optical model for the @xmath1 elastic scattering with particular emphasis on the role of the higher - order corrections like nucleon - core interaction and virtual target excitations .",
    "the @xmath0-photoproduction on three - body nuclei is presented in sect .",
    "[ sect3 ] where we illustrate the strong effect of the @xmath1 interaction in the final state . in this section",
    "we also compare our predictions with those given in  @xcite .",
    "the main results are reviewed in the conclusions .",
    "we begin the formal part with a brief review of the four - body scattering formalism applied to @xmath1 scattering .",
    "our basic tool for solving the four - body equations is the quasiparticle method , reduced to a purely separable representation for the driving two - body potentials and also for the subamplitudes in the ( 3 + 1 ) and ( 2 + 2 ) partitions .",
    "the main features of the method were widely presented in the literature ( see e.g.  ref .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . in applying this approach to the @xmath1 problem ,",
    "the relevant formalism is considered in @xcite . within the quasiparticle method",
    ", the whole dynamics is described in terms of the amplitudes @xmath20 ( @xmath21=1,2,3 ) connecting the three quasi - two - body channels characterized by the following partitions @xmath22 with the initial channel @xmath21=1 . to be specific ,",
    "we consider the triton as target . because we neglect coulomb forces and thus isospin invariance holds , the channels with @xmath3h and @xmath3he are identical .",
    "since only the energies up to the three - body threshold will be considered , we treat the pion energy relativistically but use nonrelativistic kinematics for nucleons and the @xmath0-meson .",
    "furthermore , due to strong dominance of @xmath2-waves in @xmath14 and @xmath4 scattering , we assume that in the low - energy region only the lowest partial wave ( @xmath23 ) in the @xmath1 system has to be taken into account .",
    "the essence of the calculational scheme is the solution of the scattering problem for the two- and three - body subsystems specified in the partitions  ( [ chan ] ) . for @xmath24 and 2 we deal with interacting three - body systems . using separable representations for the @xmath14 and @xmath4 potentials ,",
    "the corresponding scattering amplitudes can be expressed in terms of effective quasi - two - body amplitudes @xmath25 which describe the scattering of a particle on a two - body cluster ( quasiparticle ) .",
    "the corresponding states are specified by the indices @xmath26 marking the quasiparticles , e.g. , @xmath27 for @xmath28 where the @xmath29 and @xmath30 systems are denoted as @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "the notation @xmath32 is associated with the @xmath5 resonance which dominates the low energy @xmath4 interaction .",
    "for @xmath33 we have two independent two - particle subsystems .",
    "the relevant amplitudes are also represented in the quasi - two - body form @xmath34 with @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "the reduction of the four - body equations to a numerically manageable form is achieved by expanding the amplitudes @xmath35 into separable series of finite rank @xmath36 @xmath37 to condense the formulas to follow , we use here a unified notation for the vertex functions or form factors @xmath38 in all three channels .",
    "they are related to the ones introduced in  @xcite as : @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 . for the sake of clarity",
    ", we note that the amplitude @xmath43 of the @xmath44 scattering is a @xmath45 matrix according to the spin index @xmath46 ( we need only spin - doublet @xmath47 states ) . here",
    "the values @xmath46 denote the total spin of the ( @xmath14 ) @xmath2-wave cluster with isospin @xmath48 . at the same time , in the partitions @xmath49 , we have two one - dimensional amplitudes @xmath50 . for instance , in the channel @xmath28 the index @xmath2 numerates two independent @xmath51 states with @xmath52 ( @xmath2=0 ) and @xmath53 ( @xmath2=1 ) , respectively .",
    "considering the identity of the nucleons , the @xmath1 problem is reduced to a @xmath54 set of integral equations in one scalar variable . for the transition",
    "amplitudes @xmath20 connecting the channel 1 to the channels @xmath28 and 3 we arrive at a coupled set of equations @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 are the effective potentials realized through particle exchange between the quasiparticles in the channels @xmath21 and @xmath58 .",
    "the arguments of the effective propagators @xmath59 are the internal energies of the corresponding clusters , given in ( [ chan ] ) . in the case",
    "@xmath33 it is equal to the sum of the c.m .",
    "kinetic energies in the @xmath4 and @xmath14 subsystems .",
    "the reduced masses in the three channels read @xmath60    the equations ( [ eq10 ] ) are illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , where also the structure of the potentials @xmath56 and @xmath57 is schematically explained .",
    "the former are expressed in terms of the form factors @xmath61 as @xmath62 here , the functions @xmath63 are the familiar quasiparticle propagators appearing in the separable model for @xmath64 and @xmath65 scattering which depend on the two - body c.m .  kinetic energies .",
    "the corresponding reduced masses @xmath66 read @xmath67 the spin - isospin coefficients are denoted by @xmath68 . clearly , due to the pseudoscalar - isoscalar nature of the @xmath0 meson the spin @xmath2 of the @xmath14-cluster fixes uniquely the order of the spin - isospin coupling of the whole @xmath1 configuration .",
    "the momenta @xmath69 and @xmath70 in ( [ z ] ) are functions of the variables @xmath71 and @xmath72 as given in  @xcite .",
    "the overall c.m .",
    "energy @xmath72 is counted from the four - body threshold , i.e.  @xmath73 with @xmath74 being the @xmath75h invariant mass .",
    "below the first inelastic threshold the obvious relation @xmath76 holds , where @xmath77 denotes the deuteron binding energy . for more details concerning the structure of the potentials @xmath57 and",
    "@xmath56 we refer to ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "elastic @xmath75h scattering is described by the amplitude @xmath78 , which is determined by the amplitudes @xmath20 ( @xmath79 ) as @xmath80    as was already mentioned , the key point of the reduction procedure , leading to numerically manageable equations ( [ eq10 ] ) , is the separable expansion of the subamplitudes ( [ eq35 ] ) and ( [ eq36 ] ) . in the present paper we use for this purpose the method of the energy dependent pole expansion ( edpe ) , presented in detail in @xcite .",

    "the transitions @xmath91 must in general be taken into account .",
    "clearly , the most straightforward way to introduce the pion degrees of freedom would be to generalize the @xmath1 four - body equations to include the coupled channels @xmath92 .",
    "but in practice , the four - body treatment of the @xmath93 states turns out to be very complicated .",
    "the reason for this is the appearance of moving singularities arising near the physical region for the @xmath94 amplitudes above the three - body threshold . as a result ,",
    "the separable representation of the four - body kernels converges very poorly  @xcite .",
    "therefore , we neglect the channel @xmath93 keeping only the intermediate @xmath9-``bubbles '' in the @xmath5 propagator .",
    "the validity of this neglect seems to be doubtful , since the @xmath9 interaction in the second resonance region is visibly stronger than the @xmath4 one .",
    "the crucial point , however , is that the two - step process @xmath95 , favoring large momenta of the intermediate pion @xmath96 mev / c , needs two nucleons to be within the range @xmath97 0.5fm . adopting a simple geometric interpretation , the corresponding mechanism is associated with a small probability @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the @xmath3h nucleon density , and thus is not expected to be effective for low - energy @xmath75h scattering .    for the target wave function we take only the @xmath2-wave part @xmath100^{st}\\times\\frac{1}{2}\\big ] ^{\\frac{1}{2}m_j\\,\\frac{1}{2}m_t}\\,,\\ ] ] where the isospin @xmath48 and @xmath101 and @xmath102 denote total spin and isospin projections , respectively .",
    "the spatial functions @xmath103 are taken symmetric with respect to the nucleons 2 and 3 .",
    "they are extracted from the bound state pole of the @xmath47 scattering amplitude , calculated within the three - body model .",
    "the corresponding expression in terms of the @xmath104 vertices @xmath105 reads @xmath106 the normalization factor is obtained from the residue of the scattering matrix @xmath107 where @xmath108 is the first eigenvalue of the kernel @xmath109 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq25 ] ) ) .",
    "finally , for the @xmath75h scattering amplitude we get @xmath110 with the @xmath75h reduced mass @xmath111 and the on - shell momentum @xmath112^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "as was already noted , we consider the @xmath14 and @xmath4 interactions only in @xmath2 states . for the @xmath14 @xmath113 and @xmath114 configurations we adopt a rank - one separable parametrization @xmath115 where the parameters @xmath116 and @xmath117 are listed in ref .",
    "the index @xmath46 refers to the singlet and triplet states , respectively .",
    "the separable potential ( [ eq85 ] ) is obtained by fitting the off - shell behavior of the paris @xmath14 potential at zero energy and is therefore appropriate for processes without target break - up .",
    "the corresponding three - body calculation gives for the triton binding energy a reasonable value @xmath118 = 8.64 mev and describes rather well the @xmath3h charge form factor up to @xmath119 = 8@xmath120 .",
    "as for the @xmath4 interaction , we use here the simplest separable parametrization with the energy - dependent potential @xmath121 which gives the familiar isobar ansatz for the meson - nucleon amplitude with the bare resonance mass @xmath122 . in the present paper , the excitation of the @xmath5 resonance",
    "is assumed to be the only mechanism for the meson - nucleon interaction . rather than to investigate the dependence of the results on the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath123 we preferred to choose the parameters in ( [ eq90 ] ) such that the @xmath4 scattering length @xmath124 is reproduced .",
    "this value lies approximately `` halfway '' in the listing of various @xmath4 scattering lengths which can be found in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "it must be noted that the low - energy @xmath0-nuclear interaction depends strongly on the continuation of the @xmath4 amplitude to negative kinetic energies and hence must be sensitive to the amplitudes in the channels coupled to the @xmath4 one .",
    "therefore , we use here the unitary model of ref .",
    "@xcite where three coupled channels @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath125 are considered . in order to reproduce the value ( [ eq95 ] ) we have slightly changed the set of parameters presented in @xcite in such a manner that the @xmath126 and @xmath127 scattering data are reasonably well described in the region below and just above the @xmath4 threshold .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] are obtained with the parameter values @xmath128 the additional factors in ( [ eq102 ] ) appear due to different normalizations of the meson - nucleon potentials @xmath129 and @xmath130 used in this work and in @xcite .",
    "the parameters of the two - pion channel @xmath125 were taken unchanged from ref .",
    "we begin the analysis of the optical potential approach by reviewing the corresponding formalism . according to the watson multiple scattering theory  @xcite",
    ", the @xmath0-nuclear interaction may be treated as a series of @xmath4 collisions . in the present discussion we use the version put forward by kerman - mcmanus - thaler ( kmt ) @xcite .",
    "the corresponding expansion of the scattering operator reads @xmath132 here the green s function @xmath133 describes the propagation of a free @xmath0 and @xmath134 interacting nucleons @xmath135 where the nuclear potential @xmath136 describes the interactions of the nucleons , and the free hamiltonian @xmath137 includes only the kinetic energy operator of meson and nucleons .",
    "furthermore , we have included into the green s function the projection operator @xmath138 onto the completely antisymmetric nuclear states .",
    "the scattering matrix @xmath139 in ( [ eq100 ] ) describes the off - shell scattering of an @xmath0-meson on a single bound nucleon and obeys the equation @xmath140 within the kmt theory the nucleons are treated to be identical from the beginning .",
    "therefore we have dropped the nucleon index @xmath141 in ( [ eq120 ] ) .",
    "the formal reduction of the @xmath142-body problem ( [ eq100])-([eq120 ] ) to a two - body scattering problem leads for the @xmath143-matrix to the equation @xmath144 with @xmath145 being the projector onto the nuclear ground state .",
    "the operator @xmath146 of the equivalent optical potential obeys the equation @xmath147 with the driving term @xmath148 .",
    "the simplest realization of the multiple scattering formalism is mainly based on the following approximations :    \\(i ) coherent approximation : here one keeps only the leading term in ( [ eq127 ] ) .",
    "the resulting optical potential is given by the the ground state expectation value of the matrix @xmath139 times the number of nucleons in the nucleus @xmath149 as may be seen , the restriction to the first - order term @xmath150 in the expansion ( [ eq127 ] ) neglects the virtual target excitations in between successive scatterings on different nucleons .",
    "of course , as follows from ( [ eq120 ] ) , excitations are allowed for when the @xmath0 interacts successively with the same nucleon .",
    "one of the points in favor of the coherent approximation is the assumed dominance of the nearest singularity ( bound state pole ) .",
    "probably no less important is the orthogonality of the nuclear ground state wave function to the excited states , which results in a reduction of the matrix element @xmath151 at least at small momentum transfers .",
    "however , in spite of these reasonable arguments the study of @xmath152  @xcite and @xmath153  @xcite scattering has shown that keeping only the target ground state weakens sizably the overall interaction in the system and is therefore a rather poor approximation .",
    "\\(ii ) impulse approximation : it is considered as a further simplification of the approximation ( i ) and consists in the substitution of the operator @xmath139 in ( [ eq135 ] ) by the free - space @xmath4 scattering matrix @xmath154 satisfying the equation @xmath155 the resulting optical potential for the @xmath131h scattering is then @xmath156 where the argument @xmath157 of the ground state wave function @xmath158 is the relative momentum of the participating nucleon with respect to the other two nucleons .",
    "thus within this approximation , the struck nucleon is bound only before and after the interaction with the incident meson but is free during the scattering .",
    "the role of the surrounding nucleons is to provide only the momentum distribution for the active scatterer .",
    "the impulse approximation is more or less successful for low - energy pion - nucleus scattering far away from the resonance region  @xcite , that is , for light projectiles which interact weakly with the target constituents .",
    "but its validity may be marginal in the @xmath0-nuclear case .",
    "the main reason for this fact is that the impulse approximation breaks down if the projectile is in resonance with the nucleon  @xcite .",
    "as was already noted in the introduction , since the @xmath4-scattering is associated with a nonvanishing time delay due to the @xmath5 resonance , the interaction of the struck nucleon with the remaining ones must generally be important .    in order to study the quality of the approximations ( i ) and ( ii ) for the @xmath0-nuclear interaction we have calculated the @xmath159h elastic scattering using the optical potentials @xmath160([eq135 ] ) and @xmath161([eq165 ] ) . in each case only the @xmath2-wave part of the scattering amplitude was taken into account .",
    "the results are obtained by solving equation ( [ eq125 ] ) in momentum space @xmath162 the numerical difficulties caused by the singularity in the integrand at @xmath163 were eliminated with the help of the noyes - kowalski trick  @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to note that since the in - medium @xmath4 scattering matrix @xmath139 is an @xmath142-body operator , its full treatment is in general possible only with certain approximations .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath164 , the equation ( [ eq120 ] ) can be solved exactly using the four - body formalism .",
    "indeed , this equation represents the reduced problem where the @xmath0-meson is scattered off only one of the nucleons which in turn interacts with the other two nucleons .",
    "therefore , using the separable representation for the two- and three - body scattering matrices as described in sect .",
    "[ sect1 ] , the equation ( [ eq120 ] ) can be transformed into the form presented in ( [ eq10 ] ) and ( [ eq20 ] ) where now we must switch off the @xmath0 exchange between the nucleons . in the computation",
    ", we simply set the potential @xmath165 in eqs.([eq26 ] ) and ( [ eq31 ] ) as well as the term @xmath166 in the potential @xmath167 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) equal to zero .",
    "the matrix @xmath78 , obtained in this way , yields the @xmath2-wave potential @xmath160 ( [ eq135 ] ) for the @xmath75h scattering in the form @xmath168    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we compare the results of the approximations ( [ eq135 ] ) and ( [ eq165 ] ) with those given by the four - body theory where the @xmath1 multiple scattering series ( [ eq100 ] ) is summed exactly .",
    "there are two main conclusion to be drawn from this comparison :    \\(i ) the @xmath75h interaction generated by the optical potential @xmath161 ( [ eq165 ] ) is relatively weak .",
    "it is interesting to compare our result with that obtained within the scattering length approximation @xmath169 .",
    "the latter predicts a binding of the @xmath1 system already for relatively modest values of @xmath123 ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "the trivial source of this discrepancy lies in the strong energy dependence of the @xmath4 amplitude which is ignored by the scattering length approximation .",
    "the change of the free @xmath4 energy @xmath170 in the medium is primarily due to the fermi motion and due to the binding of the nucleons .",
    "a rough estimation at zero @xmath75h kinetic energy gives @xmath171 where @xmath172mev is the binding energy of a participating nucleon to the two - nucleon core , while @xmath173 stands for the mean squared nucleon momentum inside the nucleus , and the reduced mass @xmath174 is given by ( [ 19 ] ) .",
    "taking @xmath175 mev / c we obtain @xmath176 mev . in the calculation",
    ", the energy at which the @xmath4 amplitude has to be calculated was chosen according to the so - called `` spectator on - shell '' prescription .",
    "the corresponding energy shift @xmath177 is larger than that given by the estimation ( [ eq180 ] ) where the internal energy of the two - nucleon core is neglected .",
    "taking into account the difference @xmath178 results in decreasing the @xmath4 scattering amplitude and especially its imaginary part , which has a sharp energy dependence around the @xmath4 threshold ( see fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) . the crucial importance of this fact was also discussed in @xcite .",
    "one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] that inclusion of the intermediate nuclear interaction ( the dash - dotted curve ) accounts for an appreciable portion of the noted disagreement , and it leads to a much better description near zero energy .",
    "we consider this fact as evidence that calculations , which investigate the dependence of the @xmath7-dynamics on the elementary amplitude @xmath154 but disregard the interaction of the participating nucleon with the surrounding nucleons , are of little significance .",
    "\\(ii ) comparison of the results obtained within the coherent approximation ( [ eq135 ] ) with the four - body treatment shows the role of higher order terms in the expansion ( [ eq127 ] ) .",
    "as was already noted , their contribution is associated with virtual target excitations in between scatterings .",
    "as one sees , this effect is significant and increases as the energy approaches the inelastic threshold ( analogous conclusions with respect to the @xmath179 interaction are given in @xcite ) . with increasing energy",
    "the cross section becomes similar to the one of the impulse approximation but as one sees in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] the argand plots remain very different .    in our opinion ,",
    "the conclusions above have an important bearing on models of the @xmath0-nuclear interaction .",

    "the @xmath0-rescattering effects , being spin - independent do not distort this relation . a small deviation from the relation ( [ eq222 ] ) is simply due to the presence of the state with mixed permutation symmetry .",

    "the differential cross section is much more isotropic as compared with the plane wave calculation .    comparing our results for @xmath3he@xmath17he reaction with those of ref .",
    "@xcite obtained within the finite - rank - approximation ( fra ) , we observe rather well agreement in magnitude of the total cross sections close to the threshold ( we take for comparison the results of @xcite corresponding to the model iiia for the @xmath4-interaction ) .",
    "however we think , this fact has no physical significance , since there are principal differences in the models .",
    "firstly , we would like to note a disagreement concerning the nature of the final state interaction .",
    "namely , as explained in ref .  @xcite the strong effect of fsi , found by the authors , is due to the @xmath2-wave @xmath1 resonance , located near zero kinetic energy @xcite . in our case it is a consequence of the virtual state , as was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "we do not find any evidence for the resonance behavior of the @xmath75h amplitude ( see , e.g. , the argand plots in fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , our calculation does not exhibit a strong slope in the cross section caused by a cusp at the inelastic threshold , which was found to be very pronounced in  @xcite .    in the lower panel of fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] , we also depict the total cross section for the reaction on @xmath3h where the final state is distorted by the first - order optical potential ( the approximation denoted as dw )",
    ". the corresponding photoproduction amplitude is given by ( cf .",
    "( [ eq175 ] ) ) @xmath241_{l=0 } } { k_\\eta^2-p^2+i\\varepsilon}\\ { p}^2 dp\\,,\\ ] ] where the @xmath143-matrix for the @xmath75h scattering @xmath242 was calculated with the potential ( [ eq165 ] ) .",
    "as one readily notes , the dw approach visibly underestimates the strong fsi effect of the four - body theory .",
    "a comparison of the dw calculation for the reaction @xmath3he@xmath17he with the full model has also been done in  @xcite . in particular , the authors have noted a very large difference between the cross sections obtained within fra and dw approaches . at the energy @xmath243 = 605mev the dw results reported in @xcite underpredict those of the fra model by about a factor 20 .",
    "the reason of this disagreement is a very strong suppression of the dw cross section in the near - threshold region .",
    "in contrast to this conclusion , our calculation predicts a typical @xmath2-wave energy dependence of the cross section for the coherent reaction of the form @xmath244 with @xmath245 denoting the threshold energy .",
    "this form is slightly distorted by the @xmath0-nuclear optical potential which tends to increase the cross section value close to the threshold . as a consequence",
    "the difference between the dw result and the full four - body calculation turns out to be not so impressive as in @xcite .",
    "in the present paper we have investigated elastic scattering and photoproduction of @xmath0-mesons on three - body nuclei near threshold .",
    "the possibility of having the exact solution at hand permits us to investigate unambiguously the corrections to the lowest - order optical potential which are usually neglected within the `` standard '' optical model approach . according to the results presented above",
    ", we would like to draw the following conclusions :    \\(i ) the @xmath4 scattering amplitude is appreciably modified in the nuclear medium .",
    "the contributions beyond the impulse approximation turn out to be very important .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that the origin of this fact lies in the resonance nature of the @xmath4 amplitude giving rise to large corrections caused by the binding of the nucleons .",
    "one may expect that this effect is even stronger in heavier nuclei .",
    "\\(ii ) the influence of virtual target excitations between successive scatterings is also rather important .",
    "although the three- and four - body thresholds are relatively far from the @xmath47 binding energy , neglect of the excited states makes the result very different from the exact one . in other words ,",
    "the contributions of virtual three- and four - body states are also quite important below the corresponding unitary cuts .",
    "\\(iii ) since in the energy region considered here the incident energy of the @xmath0-meson remains small , i.e. , its wave - length is large compared to the characteristic internuclear distance , the results for the @xmath75h scattering are not visibly sensitive to the details of the short - range @xmath14-dynamics .",
    "this conclusion is confirmed straightforwardly comparing the results of the pest potential  @xcite with those given by the simplest yamaguchi form of the @xmath14 interaction .",
    "\\(iv ) close to the threshold , the final state interaction enhances the @xmath0-yields appreciably , which was already noted in a variety of studies of @xmath0-production on lightest nuclei with different entry channels  @xcite .",
    "the angular distribution shows pronounced isotropy , associated with the @xmath2-wave dominance of fsi .    in conclusion",
    ", we would like to note once more the possible importance of pion exchange in the @xmath0-photoproduction on nuclei . one can expect this since the suppression due to the strong momentum transfer which is presumably important for low - energy @xmath1 scattering appears not to be effective here .",
    "furthermore , as was already noted , due to the spin - flip nature of the @xmath0-photoproduction mechanism , only @xmath2461/3 of the nucleons are involved in the process .",
    "this may further enhance the importance of the @xmath180-exchange contribution where the nonvanishing non - spin - flip part gives rise to a coherent enhancement of the reaction strength . a good case in point",
    "is the pion production via @xmath247 excitation ( the spin - independent part dominates ) with subsequent rescattering into @xmath0 through the excitation of @xmath5 ( the spin - flip part is negligible ) on the next nucleon . on the other hand",
    ", we suppose that due to the short range nature of the pion - rescattering mechanism its contribution does not influence the strong energy dependence of the cross section discussed above but its magnitude can be visibly affected .",
    "there are separable expansion methods , which seem to be capable of approximating the three - body off - shell scattering amplitudes also at positive energies ( see e.g.  a.c .",
