    "in the past few years non - markovian stochastic schrdinger equations ( sses ) for diffusive unravelings have received considerable attention @xcite .",
    "a diffusive non - markovian stochastic schrdinger equation is a non - linear , non - markovian , and stochastic evolution equation for a quantum state .",
    "we usually denote this quantum state by @xmath3 where the subscripts @xmath4 implies that @xmath3 is conditioned on the set of continuous time dependent random variables @xmath4 described by a probability distribution @xmath5 .",
    "this set is constrained such that @xmath6,\\ ] ] where @xmath7 $ ] denotes an ensemble average over the set @xmath4 . here",
    "@xmath8 refers to the reduced state of an open quantum system .",
    "an open quantum system is a combined system consisting of a `` system of interest '' and an environment or bath .",
    "the reduced state is defined by @xmath9.\\ ] ] here @xmath10 is the solution of the schrdinger equation for the combined system ( generally an entangled state ) and @xmath11 $ ] refers to a partial trace performed over the environments degrees of freedom .    in this paper we extend the known unravelings for non - markovian sses to include two jump - like unravelings .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that in the markovian limit the simplest of all markovian sses is jump - like in nature .",
    "this corresponding to the direct detection quantum trajectory @xcite .",
    "however , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite in the non - markovian case sses are _ not _ quantum trajectories .",
    "that is , they are not evolution equations for the state of the system conditioned on the outcomes of some continuous - in - time measurements of the bath .",
    "this is because a non - markovian system remembers what has happen in the past ( whether a measurement has occurred or not ) and a continuously measured system will have a drastically different average evolution , @xmath12 , from a non - measured system @xmath13 .",
    "so what is the interpretation of non - markovian sses ? in ref .",
    "@xcite we came to the conclusion that the three current non - markovian sses , the coherent @xcite , quadrature @xcite and the position @xcite only have a non - trivial ( non - numerical ) interpretation when we consider the modal @xcite ( or bell s beable @xcite ) interpretation of quantum mechanics .",
    "they are evolution equations for the system part of the property state of the universe when certain bath observables are given an objective reality ( become hidden variables ) .",
    "the values of these bath hidden variables , at time @xmath14 , are given by the set @xmath4 .",
    "the different unravelings correspond to a different choice of which bath observables are to be objective real . for example the position unraveling arises when the hidden variables for the bath correspond to the positions of each oscillator making up the bath @xcite .",
    "that is , the set @xmath4 becomes the set @xmath15 corresponding to the values of the positions of each oscillator of the bath .",
    "for this case the position trajectories , @xmath16 , actually correspond to bohmian trajectories @xcite .    note this is not the only interpretation of non - markovian sses ; in refs . @xcite and @xcite bassi and ghirardi interpreted these equations as a new dynamical reduction modal , dynamical reduction with non - white gaussian noise . in this paper",
    "we are not going to argue against this interpretation except to say that by accepting the above modal interpretation we can easily generalize the theory for diffusive non - markovian sses to include jump - like `` unravelings . ''",
    "a difference from the diffusive case is that it does not appear possible to derive an explicit expression for the jump - like non - markovian sses .",
    "this is because these non - markovian sses are conditioned on a discrete set @xmath17 and as such it is impossible to define derivatives with respect to this set .",
    "furthermore a girsanov transformation @xcite can not be defined .",
    "in fact it turns out that to derive numerical jump - like non - markovian unravelings is effectively the same as solving the schrdinger equation for the combined system .",
    "thus any numerical advantage of using non - markovian sse to determine @xmath8 [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq.rhofromnonmarkoviansse ] ) ] is lost for these unravelings",
    ". however , the point of this paper is not to derive more effective ways of finding @xmath8 but rather to illustrate that by using the modal interpretation we can derive the numerical equivalent of the solution to a non - markovian sse for jump - like unravelings .    to illustrate a non - markovian unraveling that exhibit jump - like behavior we consider the two unravelings , spectral - mode and temporal - mode .",
    "we apply our theory to a simple system : a classically driven two level atom ( tla ) , at rabi frequency @xmath0 , coupled linearly to a three - mode optical bath , with a central frequency equal to the frequency of the atom , @xmath18 , and the two side bands have frequencies @xmath19 . in the large @xmath0 limit we observed that the jump - like behavior is similar to that observed in markovian systems .",
    "this is expected as in the markovian limit a strongly driven tla has a fluorescent spectrum which takes the form of a mollow triplet @xcite with peaks at these frequencies .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows : in the next section we present an outline of the general physical model to which the theory of non - markovian sse is applicable . in sec .",

    "we conclude this paper .",
    "the aim of this section is to outline the underlying model we will be using to generate jump - like non - markovian unravelings .",
    "the standard model is to assume a preferred factorization of the universe into a system and environment , label by the hilbert spaces @xmath20 and @xmath21 respectively .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the universe is then given by @xmath22 here @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent the hamiltonians for the system , environment and any interaction taking place between the system and environment respectively .",
    "in this paper we assume the system is a two level atom ( tla ) described by the free system hamiltonian @xmath26 where @xmath1 is the atomic transition frequency and @xmath27 is the pauli spin operator @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 represent the excited and ground state of the atom .",
    "the extra term @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( [ eq.systemhamiltonian ] ) represents any extra system evolution , for example a classical driving process .    the environment , as in all optical situations ,",
    "is modelled by a collection of one - dimensional harmonic oscillators .",
    "the free hamiltonian for this type of environment is @xmath32 where @xmath33 defines the total number of modes , while @xmath34 and @xmath35 ( @xmath36 ) are the frequency and the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the @xmath37 mode of the environment .",
    "we assume that the interaction between the system and environment is consistent with the rotating wave approximation .",

    "thus when moving to the interaction frame eq .",
    "( [ eq.hsch ] ) becomes @xmath57 which is time independent .",
    "in this section we give a brief overview of the modal interpretation of quantum mechanics ; for a more detailed description see refs .",
    "@xcite . the basic idea of",
    "this view of quantum mechanics is that certain observables have an objective reality independent of measurement .",
    "this is in contrast to the orthodox interpretation where reality is undefined prior to measurement and it is the act of observation that defines the reality of the observable .    in quantum mechanics it is convenient to define an observable as @xmath58 where the set of values @xmath59 correspond to the possible values the observable can have and @xmath60 is the projective measure for the observable .",
    "when these values correspond to numbers we can write an observable as an operator @xmath61 the projectors are orthogonal and form a decomposition of unity : @xmath62    in quantum mechanics because of the non - commutative nature of observables , not all observables can be written in terms of the same projective measure @xmath60 . in the modal theory one",
    "postulates that only one set of projectors has an objective reality , this being called the preferred projective measure .",
    "once this measure is specified it uniquely defines a group of observables which are objectively real , this being the group defined to have elements given by eq .",
    "( [ eq.obser ] ) . in this paper",
    "we will refer to this group as the properties of the system .",
    "that is , the group of preferred observables ( observables with objective reality ) are labelled properties of the system .",
    "the biggest criticism against the modal theory is that many choices of the preferred measure are viable @xcite .",
    "this has lead to many variants of the modal interpretation of quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "some have tried to address the problem of choice , either by accepting it ( the beable variant ) @xcite , selecting the position projective measure as preferred ( bohmian mechanics @xcite ) , or by applying an algorithm for determining the preferred projective measure based on the total wavefunction of the universe @xcite .",
    "the algorithmic approaches in our opinion still face choice as one has to choose the preferred factorization of the universe .",
    "furthermore we have shown in ref .",
    "@xcite that we can extend the modal theory to include positive operator measures , thereby increasing the amount of possible choices . here",
    ", however , we will only consider preferred projective measures and take the view that choice is fundamental .",
    "depending on the physical situation we wish to describe we will choose the appropriate measure @xmath63 .",
    "once we have chosen the preferred projective measure , to explain why property @xmath64 has the value @xmath65 at time @xmath14 we can introduce an extra quantum state , the _ property state_. it is defined as @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a normalization constant and @xmath68 is the value of @xmath64 at time @xmath14 .",

    "the prime motivation behind considering this 3-mode system is that in the strong driving limit the jump dynamics should exhibit similar features to those observed in a spectral - mode unraveling of a markovian open quantum system .",

    "an upward jump in the temporal mode corresponds to the conditioned system state jumping to the ground state ( @xmath153 ) ; see ref .",

    "this basically means that the average state of the system ( average over all possible measurements records ) must be equal to the reduced state .",

    "thus we see that the best we can do is to assign a mixed state to the system , this being a mixture over all possible future records .",
    "however , as jcw point out , if we can assume a finite - time memory function ( a memory function which is zero for time less then @xmath245 in the past ) , then we can assign a pure state to the system at time @xmath245 conditioned on measurements up and until time @xmath14 .",

    "to summarize , while their theory seems to be correct we are not sure of the applicability of it . in general non - markovian systems",
    "will have back action effects if a measurement is performed , so the average state for consecutive measurements will not be the reduced state .",
    "also the pure states they associate for the system are not the same as our conditioned states .",
    "in fact in ref .",
    "@xcite we came to the conclusion that the only possible interpretation of non - markovian sses ( our conditioned states ) under the orthodox theory is they are numerically tools used to generate the correct state of the system at time @xmath14 given that a measurement has been performed on the bath at this time yielding the appropriate result .",
    "in this paper we have investigated non - markovian unravelings that exhibit jump - like behaviour .",
    "we observed that it is impossible to define an analytical non - markovian sse for these unravelings , but by using the modal interpretation of quantum mechanics , namely bell s beable dynamics @xcite , it is possible to calculate the numerical equivalent to the solution of a non - markovian sse . to illustrate this we considered an open quantum system consisting of a tla coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators .",
    "the first example we considered was a driven two level atom ( tla ) , driven with rabi frequency @xmath0 , and coupled linearly to a single mode bath .",
    "here we observed that the non - markovian dynamics ( conditioned states evolution ) are quite different in nature to markovian dynamics .",
    "for example we observe that it possible to get upward jumps in photon number which result in an increasing of the atomic energy of the atom .",
    "the second example was again a driven tla , but we considered the bath to contain three modes .",
    "the central mode of the bath had a frequency equal to the frequency of the atom , @xmath18 , while the two outer modes had frequencies @xmath19 .",
    "this was chosen as the spectrum of this system ( three modes ) is similar to the fluorescence spectrum of a driven tla ( mollow spectrum @xcite ) in the strong driving and markovian limit ( see fig .",
    "[ fig.moll ] ) .",
    "thus one expects that the conditioned states evolution should contain some features which are consistent with the dynamics of a markovian open quantum system . to illustrate this we considered the two jump - like unravelings : the spectral mode and temporal - mode .",
    "it was observed that in both these unravelings the jump - like dynamics did contain some features of the equivalent markovian open quantum system .    in conclusion , by accepting the modal interpretation of non - markovian sses it is possible to generalize non - markovian unravelings to include jump - like unravelings , but it is only possible to numerically determine the solution .",
    "note this generalization also applies to diffusive non - markovian sses .",
    "that is , we can extend the coherent @xcite , position @xcite and quadrature @xcite unraveling to include all possible choices of a continuous preferred projective ( and positive operator ) measures .",
    "however , in the diffusive case it maybe possible to derive a generalized analytical non - markovian sse .",
    "bassi @xcite has already proceeded down this path by calculating a generalized linear non - markovian sses , for diffusive unravelings , but further question still remain .",
    "for example , what subset of reduced states do these linear non - markovian sses belong to and how can an extension to the normalized case be made ?",
    "furthermore although it maybe possible to write an analytical expression for a diffusive non - markovian sse we believe that , in general , due to the functional derivative the solution of this equation will only be determined by numerical perturbative techniques ( see @xcite or @xcite for perturbative approximations ) which in some circumstances effectively amounts to solving the schrdinger equation for the total state @xmath10 .",
