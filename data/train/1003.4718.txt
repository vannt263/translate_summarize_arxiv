    "solar active regions are generally thought to be the consequence of the flux emergence , i.e. , dynamo - generated magnetic fluxes risen from the deep convection zone due to the magnetic buoyancy force @xcite .",
    "observations indicate that the flux tube should be in a coherent form and strong enough so as not to be disintegrated by the turbulent motion during its emergence through the convection zone . for generating such a strong flux ,",
    "the sub - adiabatically stratified overshoot region at the bottom of the convection zone has been suggested to be the suitable place @xcite .",
    "therefore , a flux emergence should be understood as a whole process from the base of the convective layer to the upper atmosphere through the surface",
    ".    in last two decades , various series of numerical experiments have been carried out to investigate the physics of the flux emergence .",
    "for the local evolution above the surface , the pioneering work was done by @xcite , who performed two - dimensional ( 2d ) magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) simulations of flux emergence through the undular mode of magnetic buoyancy instability ( @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and @xmath6 denote the wavenumber and the initial magnetic field vector , respectively ; the parker instability ) to reproduce some dynamical features such as the rise motion of an arch filament system and downflows along the magnetic field lines . since then , the evolution of an emerging flux and the interaction with pre - existing coronal fields have been studied by 2d and 3d simulations @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed the emergence from the convectively unstable solar interior ( the convective - parker instability ) , while @xcite studied the reconnection between the expanding loop and the pre - existing fields in the corona and the subsequent formation of x - ray jets .",
    "three - dimensional calculations by @xcite were performed for the studies of the interchange ( @xmath7 ) and quasi - interchange ( @xmath8 with @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the photospheric pressure scale height ) mode instabilities . @xcite compared her 3d simulation results with observed features of newly emerged active regions .",
    "@xcite found that the numerical modeling of emerging flux regions by 3d radiative mhd simulations exhibits photospheric characteristics that are comparable with the observations from the _ hinode_/solar optical telescope ( sot ) .",
    "these simulations assumed that the initial flux is embedded just below the photosphere ( @xmath11 ) a priori as a horizontal sheet or a twisted tube .",
    "it is because their experiments mainly aimed to clarify the local behaviors in the solar atmosphere .",
    "such an initial structure , however , is not obvious since the initial form depends on its history of pushing through the convection zone .",
    "therefore , a numerical experiment including the evolution from a substantial depth has been needed .",
    "the simulations focusing on the flux emergence within the relatively deep solar interior have been done by using the thin - flux - tube approximation @xcite .",
    "one of the most important conclusions obtained from the various thin - flux - tube simulations is that rising tubes with small magnetic flux ( below 10@xmath12 mx for 10@xmath13 g at the base ) can not reach the photosphere because the apices of the loops loose magnetic fields and subsequently ` explode ' @xcite . by assuming the anelastic approximation @xcite",
    ", @xcite computed the evolution of the 3d undulatory instability of the horizontal magnetic flux layer , which formed arch - like magnetic tubes with downflows from their apices to the troughs .",
    "note that both types of approximations ( thin - flux - tube and anelastic ) are not applicable in the upper convection zone ( @xmath14 ) where the diameter of the flux tube exceeds the local pressure scale height and the flow velocity becomes close to the sound speed .",
    "@xcite calculated a flux emergence by connecting the anelastic mhd convective layer and the fully compressible mhd solar atmosphere from the photosphere to the low corona .",

    ", we have to deal with the full mhd numerical box including the convective layer , the photosphere / chromosphere , and the corona .    the dynamical behavior of an emerging flux including both the interior and the upper atmosphere is not yet clear , but is thought to obey the following picture , which we name ` two - step emergence ' model ( cf .",

    "magnetic fluxes emerged from the bottom of the convection zone are depressed and decelerated by the sub - adiabatic photosphere and extended horizontally around the photosphere / chromosphere .",
    "meanwhile , fluxes are still transported from below to enhance the magnetic pressure gradient .",
    "finally , the fluxes above the photosphere become unstable to the magnetic buoyancy instability so that the further evolution into the corona occurs . by the development of supercomputers , full mhd simulations in the convection zone without approximations have come to be realizable .",
    "the purpose of this work is to investigate the ` two - step emergence ' model numerically .",
    "several experiments have confirmed this ` two - step ' model .",

    "@xcite performed 3d simulations using the criterion by @xcite to analyze the magnetic buoyancy instability within the photosphere / chromosphere , while @xcite did parameter studies of the dependence of the initial magnetic field strength of the tube and its twist , finding that the tube evolves in the self - similar way when varying the field strength and that the magnetic buoyancy instability and the second - step evolution do not occur when the field is too weak . in these studies ,",
    "the initial flux tubes are located in the uppermost convective region at some 1000 km depth .",
    "recently , solar optical telescope ( sot ) aboard the _ hinode _ satellite ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) observed small - scale magnetic flux emergence .",
    "thanks to high - resolution and high - cadence multi - wavelength observations , @xcite found the deceleration of the apex of the arch filament system in the chromosphere , which can be the possible evidence of the two - step model .    in this study , we perform two - dimensional fully compressible mhd simulations to investigate the dynamical evolution from the adiabatically stratified convective layer into the corona through the isothermal ( strongly sub - adiabatic , i.e. , convectively stable ) photosphere / chromosphere .",
    "we set the initial magnetic flux sheet in the moderately deep convection zone at 20 mm depth , not at the bottom of the solar interior , because the emergence from the base is beyond the computation ability .",
    "the numerical results reproduce the two - step model well .",

    "figure [ fig : accel ] indicates that the acceleration turns from positive to negative at around @xmath138 , which means the rise velocity changes into deceleration phase at that time .    the deceleration of the crest and the continuous rise motion of the both sides cause the loop flattened , which , in turn , makes the mass left on the flattened loop . as a result , the rising flux decelerates and stretches horizontally beneath and around the surface .",
    "this process can possibly explain the formation of the ` initial flux ' of the previous studies in much smaller scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "we have to carry out three dimensional experiments because another effects such as the aerodynamic drag would act on the actual expanding loops .",
    "however , the above - mentioned scheme can explain the deceleration in the convection zone if the emerging field has a sheet - like shape rather than a tubular form .",
    "the field is decelerated and flattened due to the isothermal ( sub - adiabatic ) stratification on the surface ; meanwhile , the fluxes are continuously transported from beneath , that is , the magnetic pressure gradient keeps enhancing at the surface ( fig .",

    "[ fig : param ] indicates the criteria for the ` explosion ' of the emerging flux obtained by thin - flux - tube ( tft ) approximation @xcite .",
    "they found that the rising tubes with a small amount of flux can not reach the surface due to the ` explosion ' : if the tube rises sufficiently slowly , the stratification inside the tube gets close to a hydrostatic equilibrium along the field lines while the stratification outside is super - adiabatic .",
    "when the pressure difference between inside and outside the tube is small enough at the base of the convection zone , the difference decreases as the tube rises because the pressure gradient inside the tube is less steeper than that outside , so that the magnetic field at the apex can no longer be confined at a certain ` explosion ' depth . according to their calculations , the tubes with the initial field strength and magnetic flux @xmath164 and @xmath165 at the base of the convection zone can reach close to the surface .",
    "their field strength at @xmath166 ( @xmath3 , i.e. , the depth of our initial fluxes ) are @xmath167 and @xmath168 , respectively ( see * ? ? ?",
    "1 ) . we adopt them as criteria for the ` non - explosion ' . the majority of the fluxes with parameters in the range where they could not have reached at @xmath3 according to the tft model ( left to the dotted line ) also ceases emergence even in our mhd model .",
    "there are , however , some cases in which , although the fluxes are expected to reach at @xmath3 level by the tft model , they fail to evolve further ( cases 8 , 9 and 10 ) .",
    "especially , case 8 ( @xmath2 with @xmath169 at @xmath3 ) reveals the photospheric field strength @xmath170 , indicating it could be the source of the magnetic fields in the quiet sun if the fields are enhanced , e.g. , by the flux expulsion due to the magneto - convection at the surface .",
    "interestingly , this flux maintains its coherency all the while and remains floating around beneath the surface after it fails the further evolution to the corona because it has a strong field that is in equipartition with the kinetic energy density ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ro_case8 ] ) .",
    "this suggests that the flux of case 8 can be the origin of the ephemeral regions .",
    "flux 8 has @xmath169 , consistent with the flux of mid - sized ephemeral regions @xcite .",
    "we perform the nonlinear two - dimensional simulations to investigate the behavior of emerging flux from moderately deep convection zone ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "we set a much wider numerical box ( @xmath171 ) than those of the previous experiments on the parker instability ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in the typical case ( @xmath172 with @xmath173 at @xmath3 ) , the results show the ` two - step emergence ' . in the middle of the way of the first emergence to the solar surface , the flux loop turns from an acceleration phase to deceleration when approaching the ( sub - adiabatically stratified , i.e. , convectively stable ) photosphere / chromosphere .",
    "the emerging flux has a sheet - like shape , thus it is difficult for the mass on the loop to escape from the area between the loop and the convectively stable surface .",
    "this mass pile - up causes the loop decelerate .",
    "the deceleration of the apex of the expanding flux and the continuous rising of the hillsides make loop flattened , which results in the plasma kept on the flux .",
    "this deceleration mechanism is another new one and different from those of the preceding studies @xcite with magnetic flux tubes in much smaller regions .",
    "however , our result predicts the behavior of a flux within the convection zone , provided the flux has a sheet - like structure . as a result of the deceleration and the flattening ,",
    "the flux spreads sideways just beneath the surface , at which point the rise velocity of the crest of the loop is almost zero .",
    "meanwhile , the flux is continuously transported from below , then the magnetic pressure gradient enhances locally in the photosphere .",
    "we found that the further evolution to the corona occurs on the basis of the parker instability . at the point of the instability",
    ", plasma @xmath86 is calculated to be order of unity ( @xmath143 ) and the magnetic field strength is about @xmath174 . in the final stage ,",
    "the flux shows the nonlinear evolution to the corona , which resembles the classical experiments ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* etc . ) .",
    "the second - step evolution is described clearly by the expansion law by @xcite .",
    "we find that the coronal loop exhibits @xmath175 width with @xmath176 height , while the field strength of each footpoint at the surface is about @xmath177 .",
    "we perform parameter runs by changing the initial field strength @xmath80 and the total flux @xmath82 to investigate the condition of the ` two - step emergence ' .",
    "the results of the runs under considerations can be divided into three groups : ` direct ' , ` two - step ' , and ` failed ' emergence . in case of the ` direct emergence '",
    ", the flux do evolve to the corona , but they do not show the deceleration by the isothermal surface due to their strong initial magnetic fields ( @xmath178 with @xmath179 at @xmath3 ) .",
    "the coronal loops present irregularly strong flux densities at the footpoints ; thus , we conclude that they are not suitable for the formation models of active regions . as for the cases showing the ` two - step emergence ' , two out of five exhibit the favorable values of the photospheric field strength and plasma @xmath86 .",
    "the others have so large values that they can not be regarded as realistic models of active regions .",
    "we can say that active regions on the sun are likely to have undergone the deceleration and likely to show the ` two - step emergence ' mentioned above .",
    "the condition for this ` two - step ' active region is ranging from @xmath180 to @xmath181 with @xmath2 at @xmath3 in the convection zone .",
    "some recent observations support this two - step model . the cases with @xmath182",
    "reveal ` failed ' evolutions ; they fragment within the convection zone or can not have sufficient magnetic pressure gradient to trigger the instability that the second - step emergence do not occur although the flux maintains its coherency .",
    "we have some discussions in connection with the results of the thin - flux - tube ( tft ) model by @xcite .",
    "the cases which are found to have ` exploded ' in the deeper point in the tft scheme also do not show further evolutions in our mhd scheme .",
    "however , there are some cases which escape the ` explosion ' fail the second - step evolutions , one of which is possibly the source of the magnetic field in the quiet sun .",
    "the present calculations are in a two - dimensional scheme solving simplified equations .",
    "thus we have to demonstrate the more realistic experiments in 3d . at the same time , advanced observations by helioseismological technique are needed to reveal the detail of the emerging flux in the convection zone .",
