    "these conditions imply that @xmath14 satisfies the quantum yang - baxter equation , @xmath26 and if @xmath27 denotes multiplication by @xmath14 followed by flipping the coordinates , then @xmath27 satisfies the standard braid relation , @xmath28 hence quasitriangular hopf algebras give rise to representations of the braid group .",
    "tangle functors are the extension of this representation to a representation of the category of framed colored tangles on the category of representations of the quasitriangular hopf algebra .",
    "the most important examples of quasitriangular hopf algebras are the drinfeld - jimbo deformations of the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple lie algebra where the deformation parameter is a complex number that is not a root of unity @xcite .",
    "if there is a universal @xmath14-matrix , then the representations of the algebra commute under tensor product , that is if @xmath29 and @xmath30 are two representations of @xmath13 then @xmath31 is equivalent to @xmath32 . roots of unity need to be avoided because the representations of the algebra do not commute under tensor product .",
