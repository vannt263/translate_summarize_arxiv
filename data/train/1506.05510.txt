    "over the past few years , there has been an intense research interest , not only theoretically , but also experimentally , in the physics of atomic bose - einstein condensates ( becs )  @xcite , and particularly in the study of nonlinear waves  @xcite .",
    "bright  @xcite , dark  @xcite and gap  @xcite matter - wave solitons , as well as vortices  @xcite , solitonic vortices and vortex rings  @xcite are only some among the many structures studied ( including more exotic ones such as skyrmions  @xcite or dirac monopoles  @xcite ) .",
    "one of the most prototypical excitations that have been intensely studied in experiments are dark solitons  @xcite .",
    "while the early experiments in this theme were significantly limited by dynamical instabilities and thermal effects  @xcite , more recent efforts have been significantly more successful in generating and exploring these structures . by now , the substantial control of the generation , and dynamical interactions of such structures has led to a wide range of experimental works monitoring their evolution in different settings  @xcite .",
    "the instability of dark solitons in higher dimensions ( towards bending  @xcite and eventual snaking towards vortices / vortex rings  @xcite ) has been one of the key reasons for the inability to study such states in higher dimensions .",
    "although external stabilization mechanisms , e.g. , utilizing a blue - detuned laser beam  @xcite , have been proposed , importantly also variants of such dark solitons have been explored in higher dimensions in the form of _ ring dark solitons _ ( rdss ) .",
    "these efforts were at least in part motivated by works in nonlinear optics , where they initially were introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , and studied in detail , both theoretically ( in conservative  @xcite and more recently in dissipative @xcite settings ) and experimentally  @xcite . in turn , rdss in becs were originally proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite and their dynamics was analyzed by means of the perturbation theory of dark matter - wave solitons @xcite .",
    "in other works , rdss were studied by different approaches , e.g. , in a radial box  @xcite , by using a quasi - particle approach @xcite , or by considering them as exact solutions in certain versions of the gross - pitaevskii equation ( gpe ) @xcite .",
    "proposals for the creation of rds , e.g. , by means of bec self - interference @xcite or by employing the phase - imprinting method @xcite , as well as generalizations of such radial states ( including multi - nodal ones ) @xcite have also been considered .",
    "moreover , generalizations of rdss were studied in multi - component settings , in the form of dark - bright ring solitons  @xcite ( emulating the intensely studied context of multi - component one - dimensional ( 1d ) dark - bright solitons  @xcite ) , or in the form of vector rds in spinor @xmath0 becs @xcite .",
    "importantly , structures of the form of radially symmetric dark solitons , closely connected to rdss exist also in three - dimensions with a spherical rather than cylindrical symmetry ( so - called `` spherical shell solitons '' @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , in none of these contexts ( either one- or multi - component ) , was it possible to achieve complete stabilization of the rdss .",
    "in particular , stabilization mechanisms that have been proposed , e.g. , by `` filling '' the rds by a bright soliton component @xcite or by employing the nonlinearity , management ( alias `` feshbach resonance management '' @xcite ) technique @xcite , were only able to prolong the rdss life time .",
    "in fact , it was illustrated that the instabilities of the ring - shaped solitons were connected , bifurcation - wise , to the existence of vortex `` multi - poles '' , such as vortex squares ( which are generically stable in evolutionary dynamics ) , vortex hexagons , octagons , decagons etc . ;",
    "all of these states are progressively more unstable .",
    "this picture has been corroborated by detailed numerical computations in ref .",
    "it is our aim in this work to revisit the rdss and their destabilization mechanisms and , indeed , to propose a technique for their complete dynamical stabilization .",
    "our technique is reminiscent of that of ref .",
    "@xcite in that we introduce a potential induced by a _ radial _ blue - detuned laser beam .",
    "radial potentials of a similar form have been intensely used in recent experiments , e.g. , by the groups of  @xcite and  @xcite and are hence accessible to state - of - the - art experimental settings .",
    "our presentation of this effort to stabilize the rds in the form of a dynamically robust state of quasi - two - dimensional becs can be summarized as follows : we introduce , in sec .",
    "[ setup ] , the mathematical model and our specific proposal towards a potential stabilization of the rds .",

    ".  [ conclusion ] , and a number of important open future directions is also highlighted .",
    "in the framework of lowest - order mean - field theory , and for sufficiently low - temperatures , the dynamics of a quasi-2d ( pancake - shaped ) bec confined in a time - independent trap @xmath1 is described by the following dimensionless gpe @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the macroscopic wavefunction of the bec , @xmath4 is the chemical potential , and @xmath1 ( with @xmath5 is the external potential .",
    "the latter , is assumed to be a combination of a standard parabolic ( e.g. , magnetic ) trap , @xmath6 , and a localized radial `` perturbation potential '' , @xmath7 , namely : @xmath8 with @xmath9 being the effective strength of the magnetic trap . for the numerical results in this work we chose a nominal value of @xmath10 unless stated otherwise . as will be evident from the scaling of our findings below",
    ", the particular value of @xmath9 will not play a crucial role in our conclusions .",
    "the gpe in the thomas - fermi ( tf ) limit of large @xmath4 has a well known ground state @xmath11 .",
    "the other interesting limit is the linear one where the self - interaction term can effectively be ignored . in this limit",
    ", the gpe reduces to the 2d harmonic oscillator problem .",
    "both limits are particularly useful for our considerations : the former enables the consideration of the ring - shaped soliton as an effective particle , the latter enables the construction of the ring as an exact solution in the linear limit , which is continued in the nonlinear regime .    here",
    ", we will focus on the single rds which , in the linear limit , can be viewed as a superposition of the @xmath12 and @xmath13 quantum harmonic oscillator states , namely : @xmath14 this linear state , which exists for @xmath15 ( i.e. , beyond the corresponding linear limit of the above degenerate @xmath16 states , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the respective indices along the @xmath19- and @xmath20-directions , characterizing the quantum harmonic oscillator sate @xmath21 ) , can be continued to higher chemical potentials .",
    "however , the rds is known to be inherently unstable for all values of @xmath4 beyond the linear limit  @xcite .",
    "this instability breaks the original radially symmetric state into vortex multi - poles , as originally shown in ref .",
    "@xcite and subsequently examined from a bifurcation perspective in ref .",
    "our scope is to provide a systematic understanding of the rds instability modes and how to suppress them , so as to potentially enable its experimental realization .",
    "similar considerations in the context of exciton - polariton condensates ( where a larger range of tunable parameters exists due to the open nature of the system and the presence of gain and loss ) have led both to the theoretical analysis  @xcite and to the experimental observation  @xcite of _ stable _ rdss . following the motivation of the earlier work of ref .",
    "@xcite on planar dark solitons , in conjunction with the recent experimental developments in the context of radial  @xcite and more broadly , in principle arbitrary , so - called painted  @xcite potentials , we propose the following form for @xmath7 : @xmath22 where @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 represent , respectively , the radius , the amplitude and the width of this ring - shaped potential . since rdss feature radial symmetry , we first express eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) in the form : @xmath26 we also assume that a stationary rds state , @xmath27 , governed by the effectively 1d model ( [ gpe1d ] ) , is characterized by a radius @xmath23 . in other words",
    ", we will hereafter opt to locate the perturbation potential at the fixed equilibrium position of the rds . for our analysis",
    ", the control parameters will be the strength @xmath24 of the perturbation potential and the nonlinearity strength ( characterized by the chemical potential @xmath4 ) ; as concerns the width @xmath25 of @xmath28 , it will be fixed ( unless otherwise stated ) to the value @xmath29 , which is of the order of the soliton width i.e .",
    ", of the healing length .",
    "below , we proceed with the study of the effect of the perturbation potential on the existence and stability of the rds . stability will be studied from both the spectral perspective , through a bogolyubov - de gennes ( bdg ) analysis , and from a dynamical time evolution perspective .",
    "the latter , will involve direct numerical integration of eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) , whereby a ( potentially perturbed ) rds is initialized and its evolution is monitored at later times . on the other hand , bdg analysis for a stationary rds , @xmath30 , will involve the study of the eigenvalue problem stemming from the linearization of eq .",
    "( [ gpe ] ) , upon using the perturbation ansatz : @xmath31 where @xmath32 $ ] is the eigenvalue - eigenvector pair , @xmath33 is a formal small parameter , and the asterisk denotes complex conjugation .",
    "then , the existence of eigenvalues with non - vanishing real part signals the presence of dynamical instabilities .",
    "these come in two possible forms : ( a ) genuinely real eigenvalue pairs , which are associated with an exponential instability ; and ( b ) complex eigenvalue quartets that denote an oscillatory instability , where growth is coupled with oscillation .",
    "the above symmetry of the eigenvalue pairs ( i.e. , the fact that they only arise in pairs or quartets ) stems from the hamiltonian nature of the problem .",
    "a natural way to obtain a reduced dynamical description of the rds is to adopt a particle picture and use a variational approximation discussed in detail in ref .",
    "according to this approach , in the tf limit ( i.e. , for sufficiently large chemical potential ) , the rds state can be approximated by a product of the tf ground state , @xmath11 , and a ( potentially traveling ) dark soliton of radial symmetry , of the form : @xmath34+ia(t ) , \\label{pe}\\ ] ] where @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( with @xmath37 ) set , respectively , the depth and velocity of the soliton , while @xmath23 is the rds radius . then , the euler - lagrange equations for the two independent effective variational parameters @xmath23 and @xmath36 , stemming from the averaged renormalized lagrangian of the system , take the following form  @xcite : @xmath38\\right\\ } , \\\\ \\label{b } \\dot{r}_c&=&\\sqrt{\\mu}\\left[a\\left(1-\\frac{v}{2\\mu}\\right ) \\right .",

    "( [ a ] ) , respectively . a more systematic analysis , that takes into regard higher - order terms in @xmath9 , shows that the critical radius for which a stationary ring exists is given by  @xcite @xmath39 notice that , according to the discussion of ref .  @xcite and in accordance with the computational analysis presented below ( see sec .  [",
    "sec : results : particle ] ) , the numerical results strongly suggest an asymptotic critical radius @xmath40 ( see also the discussion in refs .",
    "@xcite ) .",
    "this discrepancy suggests the consideration of alternative ways of determining the stationary rds radius . here , for reasons of completeness",
    ", we will present such an alternative approach , based on the earlier work of ref .",
    "@xcite for a different system ( namely , ring - like steady state solutions of coupled reaction - diffusion equations ) .",
    "more specifically , our starting point will be the steady state problem associated with eq .",
    "( [ gpe1d ] ) , where we will `` lump '' the potential terms as @xmath41 . using the ansatz @xmath42 , we obtain the steady state problem : @xmath43 where @xmath44 and primes denote derivatives with respect to @xmath45 .",
    "then , seeking a stationary rds solution in the form of @xmath46 and multiplying both sides by @xmath47 in eq .",
    "( [ neweq ] ) , we find that the left - hand side is simply @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the effective hamiltonian @xmath50 . hence ,",

    "( [ neweq2 ] ) , we should obtain an algebraic equation for the equilibrium position of the rds .",

    "putting all the terms together in the case of @xmath57 yields the prediction @xmath61 where @xmath62 ; this result is more accurate than the one of eq .",
    "( [ appr1 ] ) , as will be discussed in more detail in sec .",
    "[ sec : results : particle ] .",
    "finally , we proceed to give a third method , based on the analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite , that will prove to be the most accurate one in connection to our computations of not only statics but also dynamics of rds states in the numerical section that will follow . in the latter approach , it is argued that the equation of motion can be derived by a local conservation law ( i.e. , an adiabatic invariant ) in the form of the energy of a dark soliton under the effect of curvature and of the density variation associated with it .",
    "more specifically , knowing that the energy of the one - dimensional dark soliton is given by  @xcite @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the dark soliton position , the generalization of the relevant quantity in a two - dimensional domain bearing density modulations reads : @xmath65 .",

    "this , in turn , motivates us to use the above approach of ref .",

    "was also adopted to that effect and was shown to give reasonably accurate results in its comparison with the full numerical results . going beyond the `` stationary particle '' approach , allowing motion along the radial direction , an intriguing goal for the future may be to examine the ring soliton as a filamentary pattern embedded in 2d , which , in addition to radial internal modes , may possess bending ones ( but without breaking ) .",
    "such studies may in turn enable the observation of collisions and deformations of rings upon interactions , a topic that has been of interest also in nonlinear optics  @xcite .",
