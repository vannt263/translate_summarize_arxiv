    "brown dwarfs , the lowest - mass product of star formation , lack sustained hydrogen fusion and cool continuously , passing through the same temperature ranges as planets . easier to observe than exoplanets , they are the first extrasolar substellar objects on which we have observed weather on other worlds , creating time - varying spectral features .",
    "clouds form in brown dwarfs of most spectral types ; if regionally heterogeneous , they cause photometric variability as cloudier hemispheres rotate in and out of view .",
    "l dwarf clouds are dusty layers of iron and silicates tsuji96 , allard01 , marley02 , burrows06 , cushing08 . at the l / t transition , these clouds form holes or dissipate , leaving the early t dwarfs relatively cloud - free am01 , burgasser02 , kirkpatrick05 . in the mid - late t dwarfs , alkali salts and sulfides",

    ", with a combination of higher precision ground- and space - based data , the study of variability in brown dwarfs is reaching maturity .",
    "brown dwarfs of spectral types from l to y have been observed to be variable using photometry artigau09 , radigan12 , gizis13 , biller13 or spectroscopy buenzli12 , apai13 , buenzli14 , burgasser14 .",
    "the shape of observed light curves is not always sinusoidal and repeated observations days apart show evolution artigau09 , gillon13 , biller13 .",
    "different wavelengths probe different layers of a brown dwarf ; by observing spectral variability we can understand both the causes of variability and the vertical structure .",
    "for example , buenzli12 observed phase lags between variability at different wavelengths and found a correlation between pressure probed and phase lag .",
    "the complex , evolving nature of variability suggests that many physical processes are involved .",
    "there are two classes of physical processes that would cause variability in t and y dwarfs .",
    "one class is heterogenous opacity sources in the atmosphere , either caused by non - uniform chemical abundances or cloud cover .",
    "we will focus on the role of clouds .",
    "the second class is non - uniform temperature structure , either `` hot spots '' or `` cold spots , '' and may be caused by effects of 3d circulation or radiative interaction between deeper patchy clouds and the overlying atmosphere showman13 , robinson14 . here , we present models in each of these categories and make predictions for photometric and spectroscopic variability .",
    "if one hemisphere has a larger fraction of the surface covered by clouds than the other , as the brown dwarf rotates , the cloudier hemisphere comes in and out of view , and we observe variable brightness .",
    "we estimate the spectral variability using 1d models that include patchy sulfide / salt and water clouds ; briefly , these models follow the approach of marley10 , morley14 ; we calculate flux separately through both a cloudy column and a cloud - free ( clear ) column and sum these columns together to calculate the total emergent flux . we can change the cloud - covering fraction by varying @xmath2",
    ", the fractional area assumed to be covered in holes :    @xmath3    using this summed flux @xmath4 through each atmospheric layer , we iterate to find a solution in radiative  convective equilibrium . thus the total flux is the area - weighted sum of the flux from the clear and cloudy columns . neither column alone carries the flux associated with the combined effective temperature .",
    "the cloud properties for water ice and sulfide / salt clouds are presented in morley14 and morley12 respectively .",
    "the atmosphere models are presented in detail in mckay89 , marley96 , mm99 , saumon12 .      to calculate the pressure  temperature ( _ p  t _ ) structures used here , @xmath2=0.5",
    "( 50% cloudy ) . however , both hemispheres do not necessarily have the same cloud - covering fraction .",
    "when the clouds / holes are distributed non - uniformly , variability will be observed ; the hemisphere with more holes is brighter and has a higher apparent @xmath0 .",
    "the amplitude of variability is calculated by summing the flux through the clear and cloudy columns in different proportions which must sum to a net cloud - cover of 50% to match the _",
    "t _ profile .",
    "one strength of this method is that using a single , global _",
    "profile isolates the effect of the cloud opacity .",
    "furthermore , the entropy deep within the atmosphere s convective zone must meet the interior entropy ; a given pressure should be horizontally uniform in temperature .",
    "our method captures that fact , instead of modeling cloudy and clear regions with the same @xmath0  but very different internal entropy .",

    "flux at longer wavelengths emerges from higher altitudes than the sulfide and salt clouds , so cloud opacity alone does not change the spectra .",
    "the predicted variability at @xmath0=200 k looks fundamentally different from the warmer models ; this is because by 200 k , the water cloud is thick and dominates the cloud opacity .",
    "the flux ratio is nearly uniform from 0.7 to 5.5 , with dips within the major methane absorption features at 2.3 and 3.3 . at this temperature range , significant hemispheric differences in",
    "cloud cover cause large amplitude variability at most wavelengths .",
    "model photometry for the partly cloudy models are calculated using radii from the cloud - free saumon08 evolution models .",

    "water ice particles predominantly scatter in _",
    "j _ band , but absorb more strongly in _",
    "h _ band and longer wavelengths ( see morley14 ) .",
    "the water clouds become extremely thick for 200250 k objects , causing almost all the flux emerging from those objects to emerge through the clear column of the atmosphere ; the cloudy point on the cmd becomes extremely blue and faint .    likewise , in the mid - infrared cmd ( @xmath8-$][4.5 ] vs. @xmath9}$ ] ) shown in the bottom panel of figure [ patchyclouds - cmd ] , the models separate into two groups . in objects with @xmath0@xmath11 400",
    "k , sulfide / salt clouds dominate .",

    "changes in cloud opacity do not cause significant variability in the mid - late t dwarfs in _ spitzer",

    "clouds are not the only likely driver of variability ; atmospheric dynamics may drive perturbations to the temperature structures .",
    "dynamical effects may create rising and sinking parcels of air on timescales faster than the parcel can equilibrate , causing cold or hot regions . the upper atmosphere may react radiatively to changes in the deep atmosphere , such as heterogenous cloud opacity or dynamically driven perturbations .",
    "robinson14 show that temperature perturbations at @xmath110 bar can be communicated to the overlying parts of the atmosphere through radiative heating , potentially generating complex time - dependent behaviors , including phase shifts .",
    "we incorporate heterogeneous temperature profiles by adding energy at specified pressure levels of static cloud - free model atmospheres from 4001000 k as we calculate the _ p  t _ structure in radiative  convective equilibrium .",

    "the timescale for mixing in convective regions can be approximated using mixing length theory ; the mixing timescale is 12 orders of magnitude faster than @xmath20 .",
    "the timescale for mixing in radiative regions is more uncertain and controlled by the interaction of the stable upper atmosphere with the turbulent convective zone , which generates a wide spectrum of atmospheric waves including gravity waves and rossby waves freytag10 , showman13 .",

    "cool brown dwarfs likely have heterogeneous atmospheres in which rising and falling parcels of air move vapor which condenses on comparable timescales to both the motion and radiative cooling .",

    "cloud opacity may increase the apparent @xmath29 differences .",
    "for example , the 5  hot spots on jupiter are observed to have a @xmath150 k difference in @xmath29 due to non - uniform cloud and gas opacity carlson92 .",
    "high resolution doppler spectral mapping has been used by crossfield14 to create a brightness map of the surface of the nearby brown dwarf luhman 16b .",
    "such techniques are currently limited to the brightest brown dwarfs .",
    "although powerful , these techniques probe limited wavelength ranges and thus a limited pressure level in the atmosphere ; the generated map is a map only of that particular level .",
    "in addition , they are most sensitive to a single molecule ( e.g. co ) , which means that abundance variations could also cause the observed brightness map .",
    "this technique is most powerful when combined with the simultaneous multi - wavelength observations that probe a much larger part of the brown dwarf atmosphere and are affected by a number of absorbing species .",
    "further study is necessary to understand the effect of gravity on spectroscopic variability .",
    "there is evidence that warm planet - mass objects of a given temperature have thicker clouds than higher mass brown dwarfs currie11 , barman11b , madhu11c , liu13 .",
    "marley12 suggest that the apparent thickness naturally emerges as a result of low gravity and that the process that may break up clouds at the l / t transition may be gravity - dependent , causing lower - gravity objects to become mostly clear t dwarf - like objects at lower @xmath0 .",
    "the interplay of gravity , @xmath0 , and atmospheric dynamics is currently not well - understood .",
    "observations of variability in planets or low - gravity brown dwarfs and comparisons with higher mass brown dwarfs could shed light on these physical processes .",

    "snellen14 suggest that using 30-m class telescopes , high - resolution doppler mapping will be possible for the brightest directly imaged planets such as beta pictoris b.",
    "we present models of brown dwarfs that include two drivers of spectroscopic variability : patchy clouds and hot spots .",
    "we find that the two mechanisms have different spectral dependence , with patchy clouds driving the highest amplitude variability within spectral windows and hot spots driving larger variability within absorption features .    from patchy sulfide and salt clouds in objects over 300 k ,",
    "the largest amplitude variability is within near - infrared opacity windows ; objects become redder in near - infrared colors ( e.g. @xmath6 ) as the cloudy side rotates into view .",
    "variability in the mid - infrared would be significantly smaller . in objects below 375 k ,",
    "water clouds are important and affect the spectrum strongly in the mid - infrared , especially within the 4.5  window .",

    "j _ as they do in _ h _ or _ k_.    from heating in the atmosphere at different pressure levels , the spectrum changes predominantly within the absorption features .",
    "the highest amplitude variability occurs at the wavelengths that probe the pressure levels where the perturbation is centered .",
    "for example , the methane feature at 3.3  probes high in the atmosphere ; heating at high altitudes ( @xmath10.1 bar ) causes the highest amplitude variability within that feature .",
