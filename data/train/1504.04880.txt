    "where , when and how do gas giant planets form ?  two main theories of gas giant planet formation - the core accretion ( ca ) paradigm , based on the collisional growths of dust particles , and the gravitational instability ( gi ) theory - provide a physical foundation to address these questions from a theoretical perspective .",
    "in addition , astronomical observations start providing a wealth of empirical data to constrain those theories at least at the earliest and the final stages of planet formation , by revealing ever more details about the physical and chemical conditions in protoplanetary disks , where planet formation is thought to occur , and by studying the occurrence rate of planets , i.e. the outcome of the planet formation process . however , the formation process itself is still largely unconstrained as we lack observational data . as a result",
    "there are large uncertainties in the luminosity evolution of gas giant planets over the first few hundred million years mainly because the initial entropy of the objects , which is set by the physics of the gas accretion process during formation , is not known .",
    "this in turn leads to a wide spread in predicted magnitudes for these objects for a given age and mass .",
    "quite naturally , in the context of planet formation and exoplanet studies , focus is put on sun - like stars in order to put our own solar system in context . however , in order to understand gas giant planet formation and to derive empirical constraints based on astronomical observations , intermediate mass stars , and their young counterparts the herbig ae / be stars , offer unique opportunities as i will discuss in the following .",

    "a good starting point for discussing gas giant planet formation around intermediate mass stars is to look at the population of exoplanets that has been discovered around these stars and how it might differ from the population around lower - mass , i.e. , solar - type , stars .",

    "an interesting difference between more massive and sun - like stars is the apparent paucity of planets between 0.1 and 0.6 au around stars with masses @xmath31.5 m@xmath6 @xcite .",

    "while spatially resolving a circumstellar disk was certainly a big success on its own and laid the ground for everything that followed , these earlier studies were still limited in sensitivity and/or spatial resolution . in the past few years , however , pdi became one of the leading techniques to image circumstellar disks from the ground .",
    "one reason was that high - resolution , ao - assisted , near - infrared cameras on 8-m telescopes were equipped with pdi capabilities .",
    "in addition to this , new ways were found to correct for quite severe instrumental / telescope polarization effects , which all of these systems suffered from @xcite . while the absolute polarization accuracy of these instruments may still be an order of magnitude away from what high - precision polarimetrists would deem appropriate , the calibration strategies applied these days are good enough to probe circumstellar disks as close as @xmath10.1@xmath14 to the star and reveal a tremendous amount of sub - structure in some of these disks in the inner few tenths of an arcsecond .",

    "it needs to be emphasized that pdi probes the surface layer of a circumstellar disk , meaning that the structures that are seen can not be readily interpreted as surface mass density variations .",
    "also , the resulting polarization signal depends on the scattering and polarization properties of the dust grains each of which depends on ( a ) the scattering angle ( influenced by disk inclination and disk flaring ) and ( b ) dust grain properties such as size , composition and structure ( e.g. , compact grains vs. fluffy aggregates ) ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "these four sources are discussed in the following .",
    "an important common feature of all of these systems is that the central stars are still actively accreting material and that they harbor a small inner disk in the inner few au that is undetected in the pdi images , but contributes to the observed excess emission at nir wavelengths .",

    "the most striking feature of this object is the complex spiral arm structure and the huge disk gap that is clearly detected in the pdi images and that stretches from a few out to more than 100 au in radius .",

    "* ) and it has been speculated to what extent planets might be responsible for clearing this gap and creating the observed complex and asymmetrical dust morphology . in particular , there is a significant azimuthal asymmetry in the mm - sized dust grains , which could be explained via pressure supported dust traps induced by orbiting companions @xcite .",
    "interestingly , sparse aperture masking observations @xcite revealed a relatively bright companion candidate at a separation of only @xmath188 mas ( @xmath113 au ) , which was subsequently confirmed by high - contrast ao - imaging at optical wavelength to be an accreting @xmath10.25 m@xmath6 stellar companion @xcite .",

    "title=\"fig:\",height=154 ]      hd100546 is another example of an intensively studied herbig ae / be star and it is impossible to list and cite all relevant publications on this source from the last 10 years . while earlier scattered light observations of this object  from ground and space  uncovered the large spatial extent of dusty material around the star @xcite , the first pdi observations revealed the inner disk regions and probed the disk surface layer down to @xmath110 au @xcite . in these pdi images the suspected disk cavity inside of @xmath115 au @xcite",
    "was already tentatively detected and subsequent pdi data with higher signal - to - noise clearly confirmed a drop of polarized flux inside of these separations @xcite .",
    "those data also revealed a brightness asymmetry in the inner @xmath10.5@xmath14 along the disk major axis ( see , figure  [ fig : pdi ] ) , which is difficult to explain as an effect from the scattering or polarization phase function if one assumes similar dust properties on both sides of the star .",
    "direct and indirect evidence for a companion orbiting inside the disk cavity are manifold , but the most compelling empirical result suggesting the existence of such a companion is probably the change in the spectro - astrometric signal of the co v = 1 - 0 line over a time baseline of 10 years consistent with orbital motion @xcite .",
    "the line flux is interpreted as coming from a warm ( @xmath11400 k ) , @xmath10.1 au@xmath23 sized circumplanetary disk surrounding a young planetary companion @xcite .",
    "motivated by the large scale spiral - arm structure of the disk initially seen in _ hst _",
    "observations @xcite , high - contrast adi observations in the l@xmath18 filter were carried out and resulted in the surprising discovery of another companion candidate @xmath10.46 - 0.48@xmath14 away from the central star @xcite .",
    "this object is located right in the middle of the circumstellar disk , where the pdi images did not show any peculiar morphological structure @xcite .",
    "the young planet candidate was meanwhile re - detected in new l@xmath18 adi data by @xcite , and common proper motion and a first multi - color analysis ( detection in l@xmath18 and m@xmath18 and an upper limit in k@xmath17 ) is presented in @xcite .",
    "the observed properties of the source are best explained with a young forming gas giant planet that is likely surrounded by a circumplanetary disk , and recent alma observations that spatially resolved the mm - sized dust grains of the circumstellar disk provided hints for dynamical interactions between the disk and the forming planet @xcite .",
    "similar to hd169142 also hd100546 may harbor two young planets orbiting within its disk , but in the context of pdi studies it is interesting to emphasize that - at the moment - the outer planet does not seem to leave a detectable imprint on the disk surface .",
    "this either means the planet is very young and/or not very massive or the local disk structure prevents the formation of a significant gap detectable by the pdi observations .",
    "pdi is a direct imaging technique that gives access to the inner few tens of au around nearby protoplanetary disks and is hence very well suited to probe the formation sites of ( some ) gas giant planets . in recent years",
    ", pdi on 8-m class telescopes with updated calibration procedures provided some breakthrough results by resolving a variety of distinct sub - structures ( e.g. , cavities , holes , spiral arms ) in a number of protoplanetary disks around herbig ae / be stars .",
    "even though these disks were imaged previously in scattered light , most of these sub - structures were not detected until the pdi studies were carried out .    whether or not  or to what extent  the detected structures in herbig ae / be disks are directly linked to ongoing or recent planet formation",
    "is a matter of active research .",
    "while the first candidate for a young planet orbiting within the gap of a transition disk was detected around a ttauri star , there is strong  and further growing  observational evidence that also some of the herbig ae / be disks do host young planets",
    ". currently the best examples are hd169142 and hd100546 , where high - contrast imaging observations have revealed one young planet candidate around each star .",
    "other observational techniques provided evidence for a second companion in each system and hence hd169142 and hd100546 are possibly the first two systems where the formation of multiple planets and their interaction with the protoplanetary disk can be studied empirically .",
    "it is worth re - emphasizing that in both cases , where planetary companion candidates have been directly imaged inside the circumstellar disk of their host stars , they appear overluminous in the l@xmath18 band , i.e. , between 34 @xmath22 m . according to model predictions and taking the l@xmath18 flux as reference point",
    "they also should have been detected at shorter wavelengths , but they were not @xcite . an elegant way out is to invoke the existence of a circumplanetary disk that has a larger emitting area but a lower effective temperature than the young planet itself .",
    "first model predictions for the brightness of circumplanetary disks do indeed predict high fluxes longwards of 3 @xmath22 m @xcite .",
    "the past few years clearly demonstrated that pdi can be used to identify excellent targets for planet formation studies and dedicated follow - up observations .",
    "the objects with young planet candidates seem to indicate that gas giant planets may well form a few tens of au away from their central stars , at least around intermediate mass stars .",
    "this result is in particular interesting because it directly links to the imaged planets on very long - period orbits listed in table  [ table1 ] : these objects may indeed have formed in situ or close to their current location .",
    "the underlying physical processes leading to the formation of very long - period gas giant planets is still to be investigated , but the herbig ae / be stars discussed above offer a unique opportunity to address this question .",
    "the future prospects for high - contrast imaging planet formation studies are bright .",
    "recently , new , dedicated high - contrast imagers came online : gpi at gemini @xcite and sphere at the vlt @xcite .",
    "both instruments are equipped with high - performing ao - systems providing unprecedented strehl ratios at optical and nir wavelengths from the ground and both instruments have pdi capabilities .",
    "the hope is that these instruments will help to significantly increase the number of protoplanetary disks with clearly resolved sub - structures and hence to provide additional high - profile targets for searching young , forming gas giant planets . as a matter of fact , as this article was in the writing , first preliminary pdi results from commissioning and science verification runs of these instruments started to become available and they showed the great promise of pdi for the coming years ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "of particular interest is zimpol , the optical imaging polarimeter that is a sub - system of sphere @xcite , as it offers a @xmath123 times higher spatial resolution than the nir images presented here . hence",

    ", title=\"fig:\",height=151 ]    at the same time , gpi and sphere will help constrain the occurrence rate of gas giant planets on long - period orbits .",
    "the expectations are that these instruments will push the direct imaging detection limits for gas giant planets significantly closer to the central stars ( on average inside of 2030 au or so ) .",
    "these results will be of utmost importance to understand whether the systems listed in table  [ table1 ] are indeed exceptions or whether there is a detectable increase in the occurrence rate of massive planets as one probes closer and closer to the star .",
    "furthermore , depending on the final statistics of the surveyed stars , maybe one will be able to say whether the trend observed in radial velocity studies , namely that more massive stars have more massive planets further out , is robustly confirmed out to a few tens of au .",
    "in addition to simply imaging more gas giant planets , gpi and sphere will also be able to characterize the detected planets to a great extent by sampling their seds with low resolution spectroscopy from the red optical wavelength range up to the k band .",
    "these data will constrain the composition of the planets atmospheres ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which may in turn provide crucial information about the formation environment of these objects @xcite .",
    "last , but certainly not least , a great leap forward in our understanding of gas giant planet formation can be expected from combining the results from ( future ) high - contrast imaging studies with observations at longer wavelengths , but with similar resolution ( e.g. , alma , evla , ska ) . in particular alma , as of cycle 3 , will provide a spatial resolution of @xmath70.1@xmath14 in the ( sub)-mm regime and probe circumstellar disk regions and components that are perfectly complementary to those probed by pdi . in particular , alma is sensitive to the population of larger , mm - sized dust grains in the cooler outer regions of circumstellar disks and in the disk mid - plane , and alma can detect the gaseous disk component by observing the emission from various molecules . taking all this together",
    "one will be able to produce 3d pictures of numerous disks in gas and dust and derive physical and chemical parameters spatially resolved across these disks .",
    "one will be able to test whether the structures seen in pdi images have counterparts at longer wavelengths and how discrepancies and similarities may be related to planet formation activities . as seen in section 5 , there are some herbig ae / be stars where already existing ( sub)-mm data in combination with existing pdi data suggest the presence of planet - disk interactions and increased spatial resolution and sensitivity will offer additional insights and open up new discovery space .",
    "figure  [ fig : sao ] illustrates this aspect further : comparing a pdi image of sao206462 with an early alma image , where the pdi data have been convolved with the alma beam to mimic the same spatial resolution , reveals that the overall morphology is not too different .",
    "a perfect match was not to be expected as different physical processes are responsible for the detected emission , and yet there is clear resemblance between the two images .",
    "turning this around and looking again at the original pdi image of sao206462 in figure  [ fig : pdi ] suggests that alma might also start resolving spiral arms in this disk once it has comparable spatial resolution .",
    "indeed , @xcite found first hints in this direction as the residuals , once a model consisting of a dust ring and a vortex - like structure was subtracted from the alma data , were suggestive of spiral arm features .",
    "that underlines once again the great prospects for alma in the coming months and years .    finally , with the high - spatial resolution achievable as of cycle 3",
    ", alma will be able to probe for emission from the suspected circumplanetary disks surrounding some of the directly imaged young , planet candidates discussed above .",
    "there is a chance that one might be able to constrain the masses and fundamental physical parameters ( e.g. , temperatures ) of these disks and maybe even get an idea about their gaseous composition .",
    "such observations , in combination with information about the local circumstellar disk properties , will eventually empirically constrain the physical processes involved in the formation of gas giant planets on long - period orbits , and herbig ae / be stars offer a unique opportunity that should not be missed .",
