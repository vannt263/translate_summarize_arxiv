    "observations towards the galactic centre ( gc ) are extremely difficult because of high levels of extinction from intervening material in the galactic plane .",
    "the gas and dust which form the inter - stellar medium ( ism ) , if distributed homogeneously along our line of sight , would produce @xmath6 100 magnitudes in visual extinction @xcite , in stark contradiction to observations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) which indicate the true average extinction is @xmath7 .",
    "the explanation inferred for this , supported by numerous observations at different wavelengths @xcite is that the ism towards the gc is distributed non - uniformly .",
    "hitherto , no extinction map towards the gc has had an angular resolution @xmath8 .",
    "+ we describe the results derived from new , high - resolution near - ir images of 26 fields within the nuclear bulge .",
    "these vlt - isaac fields @xcite , are @xmath9 arcmin@xmath10 in size , with a plate scale of @xmath11 per pixel .",
    "the fields are distributed throughout an area @xmath4 @xmath12 centred on sgr a * , avoiding areas of known high star formation .",
    "we obtained a limiting magnitude of @xmath13 @xmath14 , @xmath15 and @xmath16 @xmath17 , taken on nights with seeing @xmath18 .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to report the discovery and quantify the size scales of structure in the dust distribution unresolvable in previous studies . a follow - up paper ( gosling et al . in prep . )",
    "presents extinction maps and a detailed analysis of comparisons with previous , lower - resolution maps such as that of 2mass and denis .",
    "examination of the vlt - isaac fields of the gc reveals that the degree of reddening seen in colour - colour ( c - c ) and colour - magnitude ( c - m ) diagrams of the field populations varies widely ( see fig.[plotone]b and e ) .",
    "this property is not evident in all fields .",
    "c - c plots for some of the fields ( such as fig.[plotone]b ) show two loci of stars , one for foreground stars , and another with reddening consistent with traditional values for the gc .",
    "c - c plots of other fields ( such as fig.[plotone]e ) show the locus of the non - local stellar population to be greatly extended along the reddening vector , and containing stars with reddening considerably in excess of the traditional gc reddening values .",
    "visual inspection shows that fields where the reddening appears to vary substantially within the field also display structure in the stellar distribution on sub - arcmin scales .",
    "this structure takes the form of filaments and clumpy regions within which the stellar density is dramatically reduced compared with the field average .",
    "we present evidence in ",
    "[ sec : granred ] that these structures are related to the increased and varying reddening in these fields .",
    "the fine scale of the structures we have discovered were inaccessible to previous lower - resolution surveys such as 2mass .    to quantify `` granularity '' , we used statistical analyses to measure the structure of the observed stellar distribution as a function of wavelength .",
    "@xcite present techniques for statistical analysis of 2-dimensional distributions of points .",
    "their method is used to detect structure in galaxy distributions over the whole sky . to apply this test",
    "it is assumed that the underlying stellar distribution is random , and that the cause of the structure arises from the intervening extinction .",
    "the @xmath19-band images will be less affected by extinction than the @xmath20- and @xmath21-bands .",
    "if the underlying distribution of stars is random , then the @xmath19 images should show a measure closer to random than equivalent images in @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "+ the test divides each field into a grid of cells , whose sizes were systematically varied from @xmath22 to @xmath23 to quantify the size scale of the structures . the mean star density per square arcsec was determined by dividing the number of stars in the entire field by the field area .",
    "the deviation of the number of stars observed in a grid cell was compared to the mean number per cell .",
    "the deviations from the mean were summed and the variance @xmath24 of all of the cells was calculated . because the mean number of stars per unit area is a constant , and it is the size of a cell that is altering , the variance is normalised to the size of the grid cell , as expressed in the formula below ,    @xmath25    where @xmath26 is the measure of the deviation from randomness for the whole field , i.e.  granularity , and @xmath27 is the expected number of stars in one grid cell .",
    "+ the number of stars ranges from 1211 to 5592 in @xmath20 images , 1792 to 6515 in @xmath21 and 3005 to 9077 in @xmath19 . to act as comparison data - sets",
    ", we produced 400 test fields with an equivalent spatial distribution to the observed fields using a computer random number generator to position points in a grid , 100 each with 1000 , 3000 , 5000 and 7000 points .",
    "we applied the same statistical test to these simulated fields as to the gc fields .",
    "comparison of the simulated and actual data allowed us to determine whether the degree of granularity measured in a gc field , @xmath26 , was simply a result of low stellar density and as such a statistical effect , or the result of a non - random apparent stellar distribution .",
    "the maximum values of @xmath26 for the random fields were 1.8 , 0.08 , 0.05 and 0.04 for the fields with 1000 , 3000 , 5000 and 7000 points respectively , at a scale of @xmath28 ( fig . [ plottwo ] ) .",
    "of our 26 gc fields , 5 showed no measurable difference in granularity to the simulated random fields ( fig.[plotone ] ( left ) ) .",
    "the stellar distribution of these fields is indistinguishable from random in all three wavebands indicating that the extincting material has no structure on scales measurable at the spatial resolution of our data .",
    "the c - c and c - m diagrams of these 5 fields indicate that there is a single value of reddening for these stars ( consistent with an approximate value of @xmath29 for the gc ) .",
    "this single value for the reddening agrees with the observed lack of granularity across these fields .",
    "the remaining 21 fields all exhibit some degree of structure in their stellar distribution and show a greater range of reddening in their stellar population than fields without granularity .",
    "ten fields show only a small level of granularity , with a maximum @xmath26 value of 0.1 in @xmath20 , reducing in @xmath21 and showing zero granularity in @xmath19 . the c - c and c - m diagrams for these ten fields show reddening that is slightly increased and more varied than the fields with no granularity (  3.1 ) ranging over @xmath30 magnitude in @xmath19 .",
    "the remaining 11 fields show granularity in all three bands .",
    "the granularity is highest in @xmath20 , intermediate in @xmath21 and lowest in @xmath19 ; as expected the longer wavelength observations are less affected .",
    "thus the @xmath19-band images will have an apparent measured stellar distribution closer to the true underlying distribution .",
    "the c - c and c - m diagrams for these fields show a wide range of values of reddening within individual fields , with the values of reddening 23@xmath31 that expected for the gc ( see fig .",
    "[ plotone]e ) .",
    "the nature of the _ wavelength dependence of the granularity _ , namely highest @xmath26-values in @xmath20 , intermediate in @xmath21 and low / absent in @xmath19 , indicates it is an effect of intervening extincting material .",
    "fig[plotone ] demonstrates this relationship between extinction and the granularity in the stellar distribution .",
    "further , the association of high and varied reddening in c - m and c - c diagrams with significant measured granularity ( i.e.  high value of @xmath26 ) provides independent evidence for the relationship between extinction and granularity .",
    "these data indicate that the cause of both observed effects is the same ; namely , that both are a result of dust and gas structures in the gc . in fig[plotthree ] we plot the range of the fwhm of @xmath32 for each field versus their measured granularity , these values are given in table1 for all fields .",
    "the extinction values were calculated using the near infrared colour excess ( nice ) method of @xcite , with model giant branch colours supplied by p. podsiadlowski ( _ priv comm _ ) for comparison .",
    "the extinction law of @xcite was used to calculate extinction values from the colour excesses .",
    "a detailed spatial analysis of this relationship , including comparison to reference giant branches and analysis of the extinction law towards the gc , is presented in the follow up paper ( gosling et al . ) together with extinction maps of the individual fields .",
