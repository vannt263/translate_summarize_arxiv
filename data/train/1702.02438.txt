    "a skyrmion , first introduced in high - energy physics in the description of baryons,@xcite is a topologically non - trivial configuration of a continuous field @xmath2 , which is localized , in the sense that its gradient @xmath3 is significant only in a finite spatial region @xmath4 . far away from @xmath4 , the field @xmath2",
    "approaches a uniform configuration , which is conveniently described by a boundary condition at spatial infinity.@xcite the euclidean action @xmath5 $ ] usually has the form of non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) , with the lower bounds of energy being guaranteed by the bogomolnyi  prasad  sommerfield inequality .",
    "@xcite such lower bound is proportional to @xmath6  the absolute value of an integer `` topological charge '' @xmath7 , which classifies the field @xmath2 as a continuous mapping . in the work of skyrme , @xcite @xmath2 maps the ( compactified ) 3 + 1 dimensional space - time to the manifold of lie group @xmath8 ( which is isomorphic to @xmath9 , the 3-sphere ) , and the third homotopy group @xmath10 provides the topological charge @xmath7 , which was identified as particle number in that work .",
    "after its introduction in high - energy physics , skyrmion physics regained interest in the context of condensed - matter physics as a topological object in a two - dimensional ferromagnetic state .",
    "they have been discussed in quantum hall systems,@xcite and in chiral magnets@xcite and magnetic thin films.@xcite while skyrmions have been experimentally viewed in scanning - tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy ( stm / sts ) in the latter two systems,@xcite skyrmions in quantum hall systems have mainly been identified through their magnetic properties in nuclear - magnetic - resonance experiments,@xcite and a spectroscopic identification is yet outstanding .",
    "furthermore , skyrmions have been used to describe special configuration of the superconducting order parameter in superconductors.@xcite the magnetization or the superconducting order parameter , denoted as @xmath2 , usually maps the ( compactified ) two - dimensional plane to the bloch sphere @xmath11 .",
    "the second homotopy group @xmath12 provides the topological charge @xmath7 , which is the degree of the mapping between two 2-spheres .",
    "a more familiar case is the vortex configuration of the complex scalar field @xmath2 on two - dimensional plane , which is punctured by the vortex core .",
    "the phase of the complex scalar field lives in a ring @xmath13 .",
    "then the homotopy group @xmath14 provides us the topological charge @xmath7 , known as winding number .",
    "some more exotic cases appeal to the second homotopy group of@xcite @xmath15 that allows for establish of skyrmions in @xmath16-component systems , such as in refs .",
    "[ ] for @xmath17 and [ ] for @xmath18 , or , to the homotopy group @xmath19 in ref .",
    "[ ] . in the present study , we choose a @xmath0 field on two - dimensional plane to model the static configuration of qh skyrmions in graphene monolayer .",
    "the distinguished feature of quantum hall ( qh ) skyrmion is that it carries _ electric _ charge of @xmath20 , where @xmath7 is its _ topological _ charge and @xmath21 is the charge of an electron .",
    "moreover , such equality holds locally , i.e. the electric charge is smeared in the texture of the qh skyrmion , the excess charge density @xmath22 in a qh skyrmion is equal@xcite to @xmath23 , where @xmath24 characterizes the spatial variation of the texture in the qh skyrmion , and the integral @xmath25 reproduces its topological charge @xmath7 . as a consequence of the smeared charge density , a qh skyrmion has a lower energy in the @xmath1 landau level ( ll ) than the quasiparticle of the same charge , therefore reduces the charge transport gap .",
    "a lattice of qh skyrmions also has lower energy than the corresponding wigner crystal.@xcite we finally notice that , as a consequence of the intimate relation between the topological and the electric charge , a skyrmion is a fermionic excitation in qh systems , in contrast to most of the aforementioned magnetic systems .    in this work",
    ", we study the qh skyrmions in the @xmath1 ll in graphene monolayer .",
    "besides the robust quantum hall effects in graphene in a wide range of temperature@xcite and magnetic field,@xcite there are several advantages to choose graphene as the host system for qh skyrmions .",
    "first , the dirac valley of electron states can be described by a pseudospin degree of freedom , and in the presence of strong perpendicular magnetic field the coulomb interaction is approximately symmetric@xcite under global @xmath26 transformations in the spin@xmath27valley space .",
    "in contrast , the layer pseudospin in double - layer qh system does not enjoy such a symmetric coulomb interaction in the spin@xmath27valley space , because the layer separation always breaks the pseudospin symmetry of the coulomb interaction . in our approach ,",
    "the @xmath26 spin - valley symmetry is explicitly broken by terms at lower energy scales ( compared to the coulomb energy ) , namely the zeeman coupling that couples directly to the spin , and the valley pseudospin anisotropy . as a second advantage of the graphene monolayer ,",
    "one may point out that the valley degree of freedom coincides with the sublattice degree of freedom for the electron states in the @xmath1 ll .",
    "such a coincidence provides a convenient way to probe the @xmath28-component of the valley pseudospin directly  it can be read off from the sublattice occupation , thus allowing a direct imaging of the pseudospin texture via stm / sts experiments .",
    "moreover , the spin texture in graphene under qh conditions can also be imaged by spin - resolved stm / sts experiments .",
    "the combination of the lattice - resolved images for spin and pseudospin textures thus allows for an identification of the various skyrmion types in graphene .",
    "the fact that graphene is naturally a surface system renders these states spectroscopically more accessible than qh systems in semiconductor heterostructures , where the two - dimensional electron system appears at the interface between two types of semiconductors . for stm / sts experiments in semiconductor heterostructures , two - dimensional electron systems have been realized on an n - doped insb surface@xcite albeit with a mobility that does not reach that of the more common gaas hetero - structures or graphene .",
    "our work completes our previously obtained phase diagram for qh skyrmions in graphene@xcite in several respects .",
    "apart from a full description of the fm states one encounters at @xmath29 ( and @xmath30 by particle - hole symmetry ) , we provide here a detailed characterization of skyrmions with entanglement .",
    "in addition to a pure entanglement skyrmion , one obtains an exotic type of _ deflated _ pseudospin skyrmions with partial entanglement .",
    "we characterize all encountered skyrmion types with the help of three different bloch spheres that describe spin , valley pseudospin and entanglement , respectively .",
    "furthermore , all ferromagnetic and skyrmion states are analysed from their appearance in lattice - resolved density plots that may use as a guideline in an experimental stm / sts investigation .",
    "finally , we discuss the scaling relations of the skyrmion size and energy close to the transitions between different underlying fm states ",
    "while a critical behavior is obtained in the case of a symmetry restoration at the transition , we find that the scaling is truncated in the other cases where a ( subordinate ) symmetry is not fully restored .",
    "these scaling relations are then discussed in the context of further modifications of the anisotropy parameters that we vary to obtain the skyrmion phase diagram , e.g. in the case of a tilted sample .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : quantum - hall - ferromagnetic - state ] we propose an anisotropic energy for the ferromagnetic state in the @xmath1 ll at quarter filling , and discuss the @xmath0 representation of the qh ferromagnetic states .",
    "there are four types of ferromagnetic ground states for the anisotropic hamiltonian .",
    "each type is described by a @xmath0 spinor that contains six angular variables and visualized on the spin , pseudospin and entanglement bloch spheres .",
    "we also visualize them on the honeycomb lattice . in sec .",
    "[ sec : cp3-skyrmion - of - charge - q-1 ] we discuss the energy functional and ansatz for the @xmath0 skyrmion on top of the qh ferromagnetic states , and present the skyrmion type diagram , which is obtained by minimization of the energy functional with the ansatz and under various input parameters of the model",
    ". the detailed analysis of the minimization result is presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:4-types - skyrmion ] .",
    "we visualize the skyrmion @xmath0-field on three bloch spheres in a same manner as for the qh ferromagnetic states .",
    "these visualizations explicitly demonstrate that the skyrmions can be viewed as a wrapping of the @xmath31-plane on bloch spheres . besides , the @xmath0-skyrmion is also visualized on the honeycomb lattice , in order to show the difference between two types of skyrmions .",
    "the lattice - resolved profiles of the @xmath0-skyrmion serve as references for the stm / sts imaging of spin - pseudospin textures in graphene monolayer under qh conditions .",
    "the qualitative discussion on the @xmath0-skyrmions are followed by quantitative discussions in sec .",
    "[ sec : size_and_energy ] , where we present the dependence of size and energy of the @xmath0-skyrmions on the input parameters of the model . finally in sec .",
    "[ sec : modification - of - the - anisotropy - energy ] , we discuss three ways to modify the anisotropic energy of the @xmath0-skyrmions .",
    "we demonstrate how the type of a @xmath0-skyrmion is altered by these modifications .",
    "these modifications are relevant in certain experimental regimes .",
    "a multicomponent quantum hall system is characterized by the @xmath32-fold degeneracy of the landau levels which originates from internal degrees of freedom of 2d electrons in a strong magnetic field .",
    "for example , when the zeeman energy is much smaller than the coulomb interaction , one may first neglect the zeeman coupling of the electron spin to the applied magnetic field and consider spin as an internal degree of freedom which yields a two - fold degeneracy of the landau levels . at half - filling of such ll ( i.e. integer filling of landau sublevel ) ,",
    "the major cause for the complete spin polarization in the ground state is the coulomb interaction , which is larger than the zeeman energy and prefers a totally asymmetric orbital part of the many - particle wave function , so that the electrons are separated as far as possible , and the spinor part is totally symmetric .",
    "the zeeman coupling at a smaller energy scale then conspires with the coulomb energy and orients the polarized spins along the applied magnetic field . in this way ,",
    "the electrons in a single ll form a _ quantum hall ferromagnet _ ( qhfm ) .    in graphene monolayer",
    ", the internal degrees of freedom of the landau levels are doubled by the valley degeneracy , which is described by a _ pseudospin _",
    "analogous to the electron spin .",
    "the coulomb interaction has approximate @xmath26 symmetry,@xcite which is broken by spin / pseudospin anisotropic interactions at smaller energy scale .    at quarter filling , i.e. when one of the four spin - valley sublevels is completely filled ( @xmath29 for electron filling ) or completely empty ( @xmath33 for hole filling ) , the ground state @xmath34 for the electron system is the @xmath26 quantum hall ferromagnetic ( qhfm ) state@xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 creates an electron in the @xmath1 ll with spin @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and pseudospin @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) .",
    "the quantum number @xmath41 is the landau orbit , which characterizes the ll degeneracy .",
    "it is related to the underlying translation invariance ",
    "while this invariance is , strictly speaking , broken by the position - dependent vector potential , the physical magnetic field is constant in the entire plane .",
    "the kinetic energy of an electron in this field does therefore not depend on the center of its quantized cyclotron motion .",
    "the landau orbit @xmath41 is precisely the quantum number associated with the position of this center . in the case of one electron per landau orbit , which we consider here , the coefficients @xmath42",
    "satisfy @xmath43 . to model electron states with spatially homogeneous spin - pseudospin magnetization at a length - scale larger than @xmath44",
