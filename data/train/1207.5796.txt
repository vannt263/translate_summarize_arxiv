    "even though the first transiting extrasolar planet ( tep ) was discovered only as recently as 1999 @xcite , the number of recognised teps  and the size of the literature on them  has grown very quickly .",
    "the known planetary systems now display a bewildering diversity of qualities : from super - earths with extremely short periods ( corot-7b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to massive planets on wide and highly eccentric orbits ( hd80606b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; a system of six planets showing strong mutual gravitational perturbations ( kepler-11 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) ; circumbinary planets @xcite ; and ones with a size inexplicably approaching twice that of jupiter ( wasp-17b ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "part of the reason for the known tep population being such a menagerie is the variety of methods deployed in catching them",
    ". many of the teps orbiting brighter stars ( including the first , hd209458b ) were found by radial velocity surveys and later shown to transit .",
    "others ( such as the second known tep ogle - tr-56b ; @xcite ) were unearthed via deep photometric searches and subsequently confirmed spectroscopically .",
    "the dominant population of teps currently stems from large - scale photometric surveys of stars of intermediate brightness ( @xmath7@xmath8 ) coupled with spectroscopic follow - up programs , such as those of hat @xcite and wasp @xcite .",
    "this population is strongly biased towards larger planets with orbital periods @xmath9d , as these _ hot jupiters _ show the greatest photometric variability .",
    "more recently , surveys such as corot  and _ kepler _  have found success by obtaining uninterrupted photometry of stars using space satellites .",
    "the objects found in this way  like the deep ground - based surveys ",
    "mostly orbit fainter stars , which hinders attempts to obtain follow - up observations to refine their physical properties or even spectroscopically confirm the planetary nature of the transiting body .",
    "an important problem with the study of teps is that their physical properties can not be obtained simply by measuring some observable quantities and putting them through standard formulae : the number of quantities measurable directly from observations is one too few .",
    "an _ additional constraint _ is therefore needed , which is usually obtained by requiring the physical properties of the host star to match the predictions of stellar theory . in practise",
    ", there are several ways of implementing this constraint , and multiple sets of theoretical predictions from which to choose .",
    "as different researchers select different approaches , their results are inhomogeneous and therefore non - trivial to compare .",
    "the diversity of the known teps , coupled with the varied methods used in their analysis , makes a consistent picture of their properties more difficult to attain .",
    "the current series of papers is an attempt to perform a uniform analysis for all suitable tep systems , in order to produce homogeneous measurements of their physical properties .",
    "such results are valuable in statistical investigations of the characteristics of this population ( such as work similar to that by @xcite ) , as well as providing an independent confirmation ( or otherwise ) of published numbers . in some cases it is possible to achieve improved results simply by considering all available data rather than concentrating on only one set of observations .",
    "in paperi @xcite i presented the methods used for analysing the transit photometry of tep systems , and applied them to the fourteen object which had good light curves at that point .",
    "paperii @xcite discussed the more thorny issue of how to turn the measured photometric and spectroscopic parameters into physical properties ; the primary problem here is the need to incorporate the predictions of theoretical stellar evolutionary models ( or some other additional constraint ) into the process .",
    "this was achieved for the fourteen teps by using three sets of stellar models , plus an empirical stellar mass  radius relation as an alternative constraint . in paperiii",
    "@xcite the net was widened to include the full analysis of 30 teps with five sets of stellar models , plus a description of the methods used to incorporate contaminating light and orbital eccentricity into the analysis .",
    "paperiv @xcite further extended the project to include 58 teps , concentrating on those which had space - based light curves from corot , _ kepler _ , or the nasa epoxi satellites .",
    "an improved empirical constraint was also used ( based on stellar density , temperature and metal abundance ) , calibrated on the measured properties of 180 stars in 90 detached eclipsing binaries .    in this work",
    "i present new photometric analyses of 30 more teps , and measure the physical properties of these plus a further eight objects previously considered in the current project .",
    "this brings the total number of teps within the _ homogeneous studies _ project to 82 . whilst this is by far the largest source of homogeneous physical properties",
    ", it still represents less than half of the known tep systems .",
    "the physical properties , follow - up status , sky positions and discovery rate of the known teps are finally discussed in sections [ sec : properties ] to [ sec : discpos ] . as with previous papers in this",
    "series , extensive tables of intermediate results are available for inspection in the online - only supplementary information .",
    "i have studied the light curves of each tep system using the methods discussed in detail in paperi .",
    "the jktebop code was used to find the best - fitting model for each light curve , from which the photometric parameters were extracted .",
    "jktebop represents the star and planet as biaxial spheroids with shapes governed by the mass ratio .",
    "the results in this work are all very insensitive to the adopted mass ratio , in part because the projected surfaces of the stars suffer the least distortions from sphericity close to the times of transit and occultation .",
    "the correct terminology for transits ( primary eclipses ) and occultations ( secondary eclipses ) was discussed in sect.4 of paperiv .",
    "the main parameters for jktebop are the orbital inclination ( @xmath10 ) , and fractional radii of the star ( @xmath11 ) and planet ( @xmath12 ) , defined as : @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the orbital semimajor axis , and @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the volume - equivalent stellar and planetary radii . in this work",
    "i fitted for the sum and ratio of the fractional radii : @xmath17 as these are less strongly correlated . in all cases",
    "the time of transit midpoint ( @xmath18 ) was included as a fitted parameter . when modelling one transit , the orbital period ( @xmath19 ) was fixed to a value taken from the literature . when modelling multiple transits at the same time ,",
    "@xmath20  was included as a fitted parameter .",
    "limb darkening ( ld ) was considered in detail .",
    "every light curve was solved with each of five different ld laws ( see paperi ) and with three different approaches to the ld coefficients : ( 1 ) both fixed ( ` ld - fixed ' ) ; ( 2 ) the linear coefficients ( @xmath21 ) fitted and the nonlinear coefficients ( @xmath22 ) fixed but perturbed0.05 in paperiv , rather than the true value of @xmath230.10 .",
    "i thank the referee of a previous paper @xcite for bringing this to my attention .",
    "] by @xmath230.10 in the error analysis simulations ( ` ld - fit / fix ' ) ; ( 3 ) both coefficients fitted ( ` ld - fitted ' ) . in a few cases where the photometric data are of limited quality",
    "the ld - fitted alternatives were not calculated .",
    "initial or fixed values for the ld coefficients were obtained by bilinear interpolation to the correct @xmath24  and @xmath25  within tabulated theoretical predictions .",
    "once the best of the three options ( ld - fixed , ld - fit / fix , ld - fitted ) was determined , the final light curve parameters were taken to be the weighted mean of the relevant results for the four nonlinear laws .",
    "errorbars for the parameters were obtained from 1000 monte carlo ( mc ) simulations @xcite , for each of the solutions with the adopted approach to ld .",
    "the largest of these was retained , and an additional contribution added to reflect any variation in the parameter values from the four nonlinear ld laws .",
    "finally , alternative errorbars were calculated using a residual permutation ( rp ) algorithm ( as implemented in paperi ) , which accounts for correlated noise .",
    "the rp errorbars were adopted if they were greater than the mc equivalents .",
    "any contaminating ` third ' light ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , denoted by @xmath26 , was included as a constraint following the procedure of @xcite .",
    "a detailed investigation of the issue of third light was given in paperiii .",
    "orbital eccentricity was treated similarly @xcite , with constraints on the combinations @xmath27 and @xmath28 preferred over those for eccentricity ( @xmath29 ) and periastron longitude ( @xmath30 ) directly ( see paperiii ) .",
    "numerical integration over long exposure times is important for several teps , most notably those observed in long cadence by the _ kepler _",
    "satellite , and was dealt with in jktebop following the scheme given in paperiv .",
    "the analysis of transit light curves gives the orbital ephemeris ( @xmath20 , @xmath18 ) and the photometric parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath10 ) . for each system",
    "we also have the orbital velocity amplitude of the host star ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "these measured parameters alone do not lead to a unique solution for the physical properties of the system , so an additional constraint has to be sought from elsewhere .",
    "the possible constraints are outlined below    in each case , the physical properties calculated were the mass , radius , surface gravity and density of the star ( @xmath32 , @xmath15 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) and of the planet ( @xmath35 , @xmath16 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 ) , a surrogate for the planetary equilibrium temperature : @xmath38 and the @xcite number : @xmath39    the set of physical constants used in the process above were tabulated in sect.3.3 of paperiv@xmath5  and @xmath40@xmath2 , respectively .",
    "this does not affect any of the calculations in paperiv or other analyses by the current author .",
    "] , and are very close to the values proposed to the astronomical community by @xcite .      the standard approach in obtaining the additional constraint is to use the predictions of theoretical stellar evolutionary models .",
    "these provide the mass and radius of the host star , guided by determinations of its effective temperature ( @xmath24 ) , metal abundance ( @xmath41 $ ] ) and light - curve - derived density @xcite .",
    "the full physical properties of the system are then straightforward to calculate .",
    "i adopted the procedure introduced in paperii , which begins with estimating the velocity amplitude of the _ planet _",
    "( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the other measured quantities ( @xmath20 , @xmath31 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath10 , @xmath29 ) were used to determine the ensuing physical properties using standard formulae ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "the value of @xmath42 could then be iteratively refined to minimise the figure of merit @xmath43 ^ 2 +              \\left[\\frac{{\\ensuremath{t_{\\rm eff}}}^{\\rm ( obs)}-{\\ensuremath{t_{\\rm eff}}}^{\\rm ( calc)}}{\\sigma({\\ensuremath{t_{\\rm eff}}}^{\\rm ( obs)})}\\right]^2\\ ] ] where @xmath44 and @xmath45 are quantities determined from observations . @xmath46 and",
    "@xmath47 were obtained for a given @xmath42 value by interpolating in the tabulations of theoretical models for the calculated mass and observed @xmath41 $ ]  of the star .",
    "the outcome of this procedure is a set of physical properties corresponding to the best agreement between observed and calculated quantities .",
    "the solution control parameter , @xmath42 , represents the entirety of the input from theoretical stellar models .",
    "because the evolution of a star is highly non - linear with time , the above procedure was carried out for a range of ages starting from 0.01gyr and incrementing in 0.01gyr chunks until the star was significantly evolved ( surface gravity @xmath48 ) .",
    "this led to a set of overall best physical properties plus a model - dependent estimate of the age of the system .",
    "the statistical uncertainties on the input parameters were propagated using a perturbation analysis @xcite implemented in the jktabsdim code .",
    "this had the additional benefit of yielding a complete error budget for every output parameter , allowing identification of how best to improve our understanding of each tep .",
    "the use of theoretical stellar models also incurs a systematic error due to our incomplete understanding of stellar physics .",
    "i therefore ran jktabsdim solutions for each of five sets of theoretical models ( see paperiii ) : _ claret _",
    "@xcite , _ teramo _",
    "@xcite , _ vrss _ @xcite and _ dsep _ @xcite .",
    "this yielded five sets of values and statistical errorbars for each output parameter . for the final result for each parameter",
    "i have taken the unweighted mean of the five values .",
    "the largest of the individual statistical errors was adopted as the final statistical error , and the standard deviation of the five values was taken to represent the systematic error .",
    "three of the derived physical properties have no dependence on stellar theory so are quoted without systematic errorbars : @xmath36 @xcite ; @xmath34 to a good approximation @xcite ; and @xmath50  ( paperiii ) .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^ , > , < , > , < , > , < , < \" , ]     most of the teps in the current work would benefit from further observations of some sort , and this is summarised in table[tab : absdim : obs ] . in many cases",
    "the dominant uncertainty stems from the quality of the light curve .",
    "this remains true for many of the corot  systems , even though they have space - based data . in each case",
    "this is due to their relative faintness ( remember that the aperture of the corot  telescope is only 27 cm ) and/or that few transits were seen due to either a short observing sequence or a long orbital period .",
    "additional rv measurements are useful too . in many circumstances , particularly for the fainter objects , the rvs are good enough to unambiguously confirm the planetary nature of a system but are the dominant source of uncertainty in the planetary masses . now over 200 teps are known it seems appropriate to concentrate follow - up resources on measuring the physical properties of a golden subset of these to high precision .",
    "an additional requirement of rvs is definition of the orbital shape ( @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) , and imprecise measurements of these quantities compromise measurements of the photometric parameters ( in particular @xmath11 )",
    ".    the physical properties of quite a few of the teps are also limited by the precision of the @xmath24  and @xmath41 $ ]  measurements available . in many cases this can be improved , but in some cases this is not an option because the errorbars are already close to the limit set by our understanding of low - mass stars ( taken to be 50k in @xmath24  and 0.05dex in @xmath41 $ ] ) .",
    "there is no immediate prospect of lowering these thresholds ; in fact there is evidence that they are already slightly optimistic @xcite .",
    "quite a few of the teps have ephemerides which will become uncertain over the timescale of a few years .",
    "to investigate this i compiled a catalogue of ephemerides of all known teps and identified the first predicted times of transit which were uncertain by one hour , and by half of one transit duration .",
    "a list of objects for which one of these dates is earlier than the year 2022 is given in table[tab : absdim : eph ] .",
    "the _ kepler _  planets are not included in this analysis because they continue to be observed and will benefit from significantly improved ephemerides once these data become available .",
    "the list of the other planets is dominated by corot  objects , and it is notable that the ephemerides for corot-4 , corot-14 and corot-17 are already uncertain by more than one hour .",
    "hat - p-31 is present in the list due to the fact that there is no published follow - up photometry of this object at all , only the discovery data from the hat survey cameras .",
    "further photometric observations of these objects , such as those obtained by the terms project @xcite , are needed before the predictive power of their ephemerides deteriorates much further .",
    "whilst scientifically less relevant than the analyses described above , the discovery rate of the transiting planets is of sufficient interest to be worthy of discussion .",
    "fig.[fig : discrate ] shows the discovery rate of the known teps . for discovery time",
    "i have taken the date at which important details of that system became available in a refereed journal article .",
    "if the article was lodged on the arxiv preprint server prior to this , i have instead taken the date at which this preprint became public .",
    "the population of known teps continues to increase at an exponential rate ; a plot of fig.[fig : discrate ] but with a logarithmic ordinate axis ( not shown ) exhibits an approximately straight line .",
    "the early front - runners were the ogle survey ( including the follow - up observations which were performed by a range of associated and independent consortia ) , but the superwasp consortium @xcite held the lead during the years 2009 - 11 .",
    "the greatest number of known teps is now attributable to data obtained by the _",
    "kepler _  satellite , and",
    "once again this number includes both associated and independent groups of researchers .",
    "_ kepler _  has now been used to find over 2000 candidate teps @xcite and possible as many as 5000 @xcite ; the rate of false positives is probably small but remains under discussion @xcite .",
    "the candidate list provides the ammunition to continue the exponential rise in the number of known teps .",
    "fig.[fig : skypos ] shows the sky positions of the known teps , overlaid with the celestial equator and galactic plane , and is a good tool to illustrate the strength and diversity of the selection effects which afflict this population .",
    "the most obvious feature in fig.[fig : skypos ] is a strong clustering around 19hr right ascension and @xmath51 declination , which is the _ kepler _  field .",
    "the _ kepler _  satellite @xcite is currently the most successful tep discovery machine , and has a modest field of view ( 105deg@xmath49 ) .",
    "this concentration of points is the result .",
    "additional clusters of teps occur around the intersections of the galactic plane with the celestial equator , the two areas targeted by the corot  satellite @xcite .",
    "corot  aims for these positions in order to obtain a high surface density of stars ( to give plenty of targets in its small 8.2deg@xmath49 field of view ) which are easily followed up using ground - based telescopes in both hemispheres .",
    "two other small groups of teps come via the ogle survey @xcite observations of the galactic centre ( 18hr r.a .  and @xmath52 dec ) and carina regions ( 11hr r.a .  and @xmath53 dec ) .    the wider spread of objects in fig.[fig : skypos ] is dominated by hat @xcite in the north and superwasp @xcite in the south .",
    "these , plus other similar projects , operate multiple small wide - field telescopes with very coarse pixel scales .",
    "they are thus able to cover large amounts of sky but must avoid the crowded fields towards the galactic plane , due to problems with blending .",
    "blending makes it more difficult to measure good photometry and also elevates the rate of false alarms in a search for teps .",
    "the surveys operating small ground - based telescopes tend to point away from the galactic plane , which introduces a bias towards intrinsically faint stars .",
    "this is advantageous because it reduces the fraction of giants in the studied sample ; these surveys can not find planets around giant stars but are able to detect larger transiting object which are of lesser scientific interest .",
    "conversely , the _ kepler _  satellite studies stars with fainter apparent magnitudes which are located close to the galactic plane .",
    "these stars have slightly different population characteristics to those studied by other surveys with different designs ; @xcite show that the host stars of the _ kepler _  planet candidates are preferentially metal - rich .",
    "such biases must be accounted for when studying the population characteristics of the known teps and their host stars .",
    "the _ homogeneous studies _ project aims to provide measurements of the physical properties of a large sample of transiting extrasolar planetary systems , using consistent methods and with careful attention paid to the estimation of robust statistical and systematic errors .",
    "the transit light curves are modelled using the jktebop code , and uncertainties are gauged with monte carlo and residual - permutation algorithms .",
    "attention is paid to the treatment of limb darkening , orbital eccentricity , and contaminating ` third ' light . to the resulting photometric parameters",
    "are added measured spectroscopic quantities : the @xmath24 , @xmath41 $ ]  and velocity amplitude of the host star .",
    "one additional constraint is needed , and is supplied either by one of five sets of theoretical stellar evolutionary models or by a semi - empirical calibration of low - mass star properties based on detached eclipsing binaries .",
    "the statistical errors are propagated using a perturbation algorithm , leading to complete error budgets for each output quantity .",
    "the inclusion of multiple stellar models allows systematic errors to be deduced too .",
    "the current paper has presented complete analyses of thirty tep systems , and updated the physical properties of eight more systems based on newly published spectroscopic results .",
    "combined with previous work , this yields a total of 82 transiting planets and host stars with homogeneously - measured physical properties . in many cases these results",
    "are based on more numerous datasets than previous measurements , so should be preferred over literature values even if homogeneity is not of specific importance to the matter in hand .",
    "headline results from the current paper are summarised below .",
    "analyses in the current work were the first to consider all available good light curves for hat - p-3 ( five datasets ) , hat - p-6 ( three ) , hat - p-9 ( four ) , hat - p-14 ( four ) , wasp-12 ( four ) and wasp-14 ( four ) . for wasp-14",
    "this has resulted in a change in planetary radius ( @xmath16 ) from @xmath54@xmath2  to @xmath55@xmath2 , moving this object away from the parameter space occupied by theoretical predictions .",
    "the current study is also the first to present results based on short - cadence data for kepler-14 , kepler-15 and koi-135 .",
    "the measured mass of kepler-14a has decreased by @xmath56 , and the measured radii of both components in the kepler-15 system are both significantly larger .",
    "the density deduced for kepler-15b is lower by a factor of two compared to previous studies .",
    "additional data was modelled for koi-196 , koi-204 , koi-254 , koi-423 and koi-428 . in two cases ( koi-423 and koi-428 ) the available data is more than a factor three more extensive than used in published studies . for koi-428 the radii of the components are larger than previously found ;",
    "the star is now comfortably the largest known known to host a tep at @xmath57@xmath5 .",
    "the physical properties of ogle - tr-56 have been heavily revised based on the first complete analysis of newly - published high - quality photometry @xcite .",
    "the radius of the planet is @xmath58@xmath2 , which is much larger than all previous determinations ( 1.231.38@xmath2 ) .",
    "this radius makes ogle - tr-56b one of the largest known planets , as expected for its high equilibrium temperature and hot and massive host star .",
    "its measured density is smaller by a factor of three .",
    "previous analyses were based either on survey - quality photometry , a single transit light curve which is now known to be strongly affected by correlated noise , or on unnecessary assumptions . two morals can be deduced from this .",
    "firstly , one should always use a newly - derived stellar density in calculating revised physical properties of a tep system . secondly",
    ", results based on only one transit light curve can not be definitive as systematic errors may lurk undetected in the data .",
    "new results have also been calculated for ogle - tr-111 , ogle - tr-113 , ogle - tr-132 and ogle - tr - l9 .",
    "these comprise the first complete analyses of recently published high - quality photometry for each system .",
    "for wasp-13 and wasp-21 my analysis has resulted in the upward revision of the planetary radii , making them two of the least dense planets known . for wasp-13 @xmath16 changes from @xmath59@xmath2  to @xmath60@xmath2 , and for wasp-21",
    "the change is from @xmath61@xmath2  to @xmath62@xmath2 .",
    "finally , the inclusion of an improved @xmath24  measurement makes wasp-2 one of the best - understood tep systems .",
    "previously found correlations between @xmath20  and planet gravity , and @xmath20  and planet mass , have been revisited and found to be of improved statistical significance ( @xmath63 and @xmath64 respectively ) .",
    "the division of teps into two classes based on their safronov number is shown to be spurious .",
    "i recommend further observations of specific types for the majority of the objects studied here .",
    "these are summarised in sect.[sec : followup ] .",
    "in particular , some orbital ephemerides are of low precision and will soon be of limited use .",
    "the affected systems would benefit from new transit photometry to solve this problem . finally , the discovery rate and distribution of sky positions of the known teps are plotted and discussed .",
