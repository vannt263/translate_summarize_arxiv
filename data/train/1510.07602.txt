    "series of ultrashort laser pulses , also known as _ pulse trains _ ( pt ) , have found widespread use in the field of quantum coherent control of matter with laser light ( for a recent review of this topic , see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "numerous applications require multiple pulses of relatively high intensity , on the order of @xmath2 to @xmath3  w/@xmath4 , to attain the regime of strong - field interaction with each pulse , just below the damage threshold of the material system under study . using coherent control of molecular rotation - an area of our own expertise - as only one representative example : sequences of intense ultrashort pulses have been key in enhancing molecular alignment  @xcite and aligning asymmetric top molecules in three dimensions  @xcite , selective excitation of molecular isotopes and spin isomers  @xcite , initiating uni - directional rotation  @xcite and controlling gas hydrodynamics  @xcite , as well as studying the quantum @xmath5-kicked rotor in a series of recent fundamental works  @xcite .",
    "the great utility of pts stems from two main factors .",
    "first , by matching the timing of pulses in the train to the dynamics of the system of interest , e.g. the vibrational or rotational period of a molecule , one can often significantly improve the selectivity of excitation .",
    "second , the ability to re - distribute the energy among multiple pulses without losing the cumulative excitation strength enables one to avoid detrimental strong - field effects , such as molecular ionization and gas filamentation .",
    "there are two common techniques to produce a pulse train with variable time separation between transform - limited pulses . in the first technique ,",
    "the incoming laser pulse is split into @xmath6 pulses using @xmath7 nested michelson interferometers ( mi ) .",
    "even though sequences of up to 16  pulses  @xcite have been generated using this method , the scheme becomes increasingly more difficult to implement with the increasing value of @xmath7 .",
    "we also note , that the control over the pulse timing is rather limited in that it can not be changed independently for each individual pulse in the train .",
    "similarly limited flexibility is characteristic of a pulse splitting method based on stacking a number of birefringent crystals  @xcite .",
    "the second common approach is based on the technique of femtosecond pulse shaping ( ps ) where the spatially dispersed frequency components of the pulse are controlled in phase and amplitude  @xcite , or via the direct space - to - time conversion  @xcite .",
    "this offers much higher flexibility at the expense of being limited to the relatively low energy trains .",
    "the latter limitation is due to both the damage threshold of a typical pulse shaper , and also the necessity to block multiple spectral components in order to generate a train of pulses in the time domain .",
    "phase - only shaping has been often used to create a series of pulses without the loss of energy  @xcite , but in this case , the distribution of the pulse amplitudes within the train is uneven and no control over this distribution is available .    here",
    "we report on the generation of femtosecond pulse trains , that simultaneously satisfy the following specific characteristics : ( 1 ) consist of a large number of transform - limited pulses ; ( 2 ) exhibit a relatively flat amplitude envelope ; ( 3 ) can be easily tuned in terms of the timing of the constituent pulses ; and ( 4 ) carry energies in excess of @xmath0j per pulse .",
    "our method is based on the combination of a pulse shaper , which provides the often required flexibility in controlling the timing and amplitudes of individual pulses on the time scale of 50  ps , and a set of nested michelson interferometers , which enables extending the overall length of the train to much longer times .",
    "key to our approach is the integration of a multi - pass amplifier ( mpa ) , which compensates the energy loss during the pulse shaping stage .",
    "we note that although amplification of shaped pulses is commonly used in chirped - pulse amplifiers  @xcite , and has also been employed to amplify pulse sequences  @xcite , to our knowledge , pulse trains with the above mentioned specifications have not been demonstrated .",
    "we discuss the versatility of the developed tool and demonstrate an example of a long pulse train consisting of 84 equally strong pulses .",
    "we start with a ti : sapphire femtosecond laser system ( spitfire pro , spectra - physics ) producing uncompressed frequency - chirped pulses with the spectral bandwidth of 9  nm ( full width at half maximum ) at the central wavelength of 800  nm , 1  khz repetition rate and 2  mj per pulse .",
    "part of the beam ( 60% in energy ) is compressed to 120  fs pulses ( full width at half maximum ) via a grating compressor and is used as a reference in cross - correlation measurements .",
    "the second part is sent to a femtosecond pulse shaper which splits a single chirped pulse into a series of pulses , as schematically shown in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "the shaper is built in the standard @xmath8-geometry @xcite and uses a liquid crystal spatial light modulator ( slm , cambridge research and instrumentation , inc . ) with a double - layer 640-pixel mask .",
    "we control the spectral phase and amplitude of the laser pulse to achieve the desired waveform of the output train .",
    "the required frequency masks are calculated through the fourier transform of the target temporal profile ( for more details see ref .",
    "the spectral resolution of @xmath9 per pixel sets the upper limit for the total duration of the pulse train to @xmath10 , where the central wavelength @xmath11 and @xmath12 is the speed of light in vacuum .",
    "the shaper is followed by two nested michelson interferometers , shown inside the dotted box in fig.[fig : setup ] .",
    "in contrast to the pulse shaper , the interferometric setup has no limitation on the overall length of the final pulse train .",
    "it allows to quadruple the number of pulses in the sequence and extend its duration to at least four times that produced by the shaper .",
    "j ) and after ( red dashed , 100  @xmath1j ) the amplification in the multi - pass amplifier ( mpa ) . ]    -.1truein [ fig : setup ]    unavoidable optical energy losses in the combined ps+mi setup can be quantified as follows .",
    "about 50% of energy is lost in a typical @xmath8 pulse shaper due to the diffraction efficiency of the gratings .",
    "the energy throughput owing to the splitting of the initial pulse into a sequence of @xmath13 identical pulses by means of the spectral shaping can be estimated as @xmath14 @xcite .",
    "another factor of 1/2 accounts for the polarization multiplexing in the mi setup . in total , each of the 4n  pulses in the train carries @xmath15 of the available input energy .",
    "since the latter is typically limited to about 1  mj by the damage threshold of a pulse shaper ( 300  @xmath1j in our case ) , for a train of @xmath16 pulses demonstrated in this work , one ends up with @xmath17 @xmath18j per pulse .",
    "imperfections of various optical components bring this number even further down , well below the typical requirements for a strong - field regime of the laser - molecule interaction .    to compensate for the energy losses described above",
    ", we send the long pulse train through a home - built multi - pass amplifier , schematically shown inside the dashed box in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . after passing four times through a ti : sapphire crystal , pumped by a neodymium yag laser ( powerlite precision ii , continuum , 800  mj at 532  nm and 10  hz repetition rate )",
    ", the pulses are amplified by a factor of up to 2800 , reaching the energy of more than 100  @xmath1j per pulse .",
    "both the pulse shaping and the interferometric splitting are applied to uncompressed frequency - chirped 150  ps pulses , so as to lower the peak intensities of the amplified pulses inside the mpa below the damage threshold of the ti : sapphire crystal .",
    "chirped amplification also ensures negligible spectral distortions of the output pulses , as demonstrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] .",
    "the spectrum of a single pulse amplified 250 times to an energy of 100  @xmath1j ( red dashed line ) is almost indistinguishable from the spectrum of an unamplified pulse at 0.4  @xmath1j ( black solid line ) .",
    "the mpa is followed by a standard grating - based pulse compressor that compresses each pulse of the sequence to a 120  fs duration .",
    "first , we discuss pulse sequences which can be created with the pulse shaper only , i.e. without the use of michelson interferometers . the pulse trains are characterized using the technique of cross - correlation frequency - resolved optical gating ( xfrog ) with a well - known transform - limited reference pulse .",
    "figure  [ fig : pulsetrain_xfrog](*a * ) shows an xfrog spectrogram for the pulse train of 21 equally spaced pulses with a period of 2  ps .",
    "the spectrogram demonstrates that each pulse in the train is transform - limited with no residual frequency chirp , confirming that proper pulse compression is attainable at the end of the combined shaping and amplification processes .    integrating over the whole spectrum ,",
    "one finds the distribution of energy among the pulses in the train , plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsetrain_xfrog](*b * ) . here , the gain factor of 400 was required for reaching an average energy of 124  @xmath1j per pulse",
    ". such high gain levels result in the increased sensitivity of the output pulse sequence to the energy fluctuations in the seed train entering the mpa , as well as in pulse dependent amplification rates . equalizing the output amplitudes",
    "is achieved through the iterative process , in which the correction function is fed back to the pulse shaper in order to compensate for the irregularities in the output temporal profile . in the presented example , the corrected seed train is shown in fig .  [",

    "[ fig : pulsetrain_versatile ] , we demonstrate this flexibility using the example of a pulse train with nine pulses .",

    "[ fig : pulsetrain_versatile ]    adding a set of nested michelson interferometers enables us to generate pulse sequences longer than the time limit set by the spectral resolution of the shaper ( in our case , 50  ps ) and with more pulses , while still maintaining the energy level in excess of 100  @xmath18j per pulse . in figures  [ fig :",
