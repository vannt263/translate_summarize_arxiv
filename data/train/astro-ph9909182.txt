    "we examine the relativistic electron populations in two wide - angle tails ( wats ) : 1231 + 674 and 1433 + 553 .",
    "previous analyses @xcite have identified two apparently distinct populations of relativistic electrons : a flat spectrum jet and a steep spectrum sheath. the overall question for this research is : can the current aging models account for all of the observed spectra ?",
    "we apply two techniques previously developed by katz - stone and rudnick @xcite to three frequency observations ( @xmath0@xmath0 20 , 6 , and 3.6 cm ) taken from the very large array : spectral tomography and color - color diagrams . in this paper , @xmath1 is defined as i @xmath2 @xmath3 .",
    "spectral tomography is a technique designed to isolate overlapping structures with unique spectral indices .",
    "two tomography galleries of images are constructed from pairs of frequency maps where ( e.g. ) :    @xmath4    slices are taken on each image in the tomography gallery at the same position .",
    "the spectral index @xmath5 of the structure ( e.g. the jet ) is determined when the jet disappears at @xmath6 = background level .",
    "color - color diagrams are plots of spectral index at one pair of frequencies vs. spectral index at another pair of frequencies @xcite . as such",
    ", only three frequencies are needed to plot the local curvature of the spectrum .",
    "the locus of different power - law spectra would lie along the line where @xmath7 .",
    "plotted on the color - color diagram in fig .",
    "2 are the wat data for 1231 + 674 and the three standard aging models of a synchrotron spectrum .",
    "the continuous injection ( ci ) model assumes that relativistic electrons are constantly supplied into the system .",
    "the jaffe & perola ( jp ) model scatters the relativistic electrons in order to maintain an isotropic pitch angle distributions .",
    "the kardashev & pacholczyk ( kp ) model maintains a constant pitch angle for the relativistic electrons .",
    "[ .5 ]    [ allcc ]",
    "although the current aging models can not account for the observed spectra for all positions in 1231 + 674 or 1433 + 553 ( not shown here ) , both sources exhibit similar spectral characteristics :    1 .   what is the injection spectrum of the jet ? + the spectral indices for the jet points ( closed circles ) in 1231 + 674 were obtained from the tomography slices .",
    "the injection index of the flat spectrum component ( jet ) follows a power - law with a spectral index of @xmath1 @xmath8 -0.55 @xmath9 0.05 .",
    "the fr i galaxy 3c449 @xcite also shows a similar injection spectrum of @xmath1 @xmath8 -0.53 @xmath9 0.01 .",
    "no steepening of the jet s spectrum can be seen up to 56 kpc for 1231 + 674 and 29 kpc for 1433 + 553 .",
    "how do the spectral shapes change with resolution ?",
    "+ the full integrated spectrum ( open circle ) , lies close to a power - law ( figure 2 @xmath10 table 1 ) . however , this integrated spectral index @xmath11 @xmath12 ( @xmath8 -0.55 ) .",
    "if we convolve the maps to a lower resolution than shown here in fig.1 , the observed spectra lie close to the power - law line with a broad range of power - laws .",
    "this is due to the mixing of spectral components .",
    "again , there is no relation to the apparent injection index ( @xmath1 @xmath8 -0.55 ) of the jet .",
    "if we observe at higher resolution , it may be possible to determine the intrinsic shape of the spectrum for isolated components .",
    "+ [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]    3 .   what is the relationship between the spectral shapes and the local structure of the wats ? + the squares ( sheath ) , obtained from a straight division where @xmath1 = ( ln @xmath13 / ln @xmath14 ) / ( ln @xmath15 / ln @xmath16 ) , were selected based on their low surface brightness",
    ". this ` sheath ' population ( as defined by ) appears to represent a roughly separate spectral population in the color - color diagram . in the color - color diagram",
    ", we find that the squares are largely consistent with a single jp spectrum with an injection index of @xmath8 -0.5 as measured for the jet .",
    "therefore , the criterion of low surface brightness appears to be a reliable indicator of an isolated spectral population .",
    "the triangles , also obtained from a straight division , represent every other location on the wats .",
    "however , they are not consistent any of the standard models . they can be simply understood as an apparently broader spectrum caused by a varying mixture of flat spectrum jet and steep spectrum sheath components .",
    "+ everywhere else in both wats , the spectral shapes are due to either a mixture of relativisitic electron populations or inhomogeneities in the local magnetic field @xcite .",
    "a single kp or jp model is consistent with many of the spectral regions if we allow for these conditions .",
    "in addition , an empirical model presented in for cygnus a can also represent much of the spectral shapes seen in the color - color diagrams .",
    "for both 1231 + 674 and 1433 + 553 , the jp model ( with @xmath12 @xmath8 -0.5 ) serves as an approximate boundary for the maximum curvature seen in the spectrum .",
    "+ alternatively , the observed spectra may be explained by using two homogeneous but distinct electron populations . in this scenario",
    ", the jet and sheath begins with different injection indices .",
    "both 1231 + 674 and 1433 + 553 would have @xmath17 @xmath8 -0.55 while @xmath18 @xmath8 -1.0 and -0.85 respectively .",
    "future work will include further discussions about these population alternatives and the implications our results may have on current aging analyses ."
