    "decoherence embodies the detrimental effects of noise on any quantum system whose coherence , in its widest sense , is smeared causing the loss of information of the initial state @xcite .",
    "this represents a focal point in quantum information theory @xcite as it limits both the attainable fidelity and the variety of accessible protocols @xcite .",
    "in particular , entanglement  @xcite represents a fundamental resource in quantum computation @xcite and thus it should be protected against dechorence . in this regard ,",
    "the most undesirablefamily of quantum processes is given by the so - called entanglement breaking ( eb ) maps @xcite , under whose action any entanglement initially installed between the system and an external ancilla is completely lost .",
    "these are maps acting on one component of an entangled pair leaving unperturbed the other .    _ amendable channels _ strongly related to eb maps @xcite .",
    "they realize an eb map when applied twice consecutively on the same system , but they admit a _ filtering _ operation that , applied in between the first and the second action of the map , prevents the global transformation from being entanglement breaking . identifying the set of amendable channels and their associated filtering operations is an important quantum error correction task which have profound implications in many research areas . in particular this could be useful in developing efficient long - range communication schemes based on quantum repeaters architectures  @xcite where the signaling process takes place through intermediaries ( the quantum repeaters ) who collect , process , and redistribute the messages sent by the communicating parties ( in this picture the action of an amendable channel simulates the transferring from two communicating parties and one repeater , while the filtering operation corresponds to the data processing performed by the latter ) .",
    "the study of amendable channels is particularly relevant in the context of the so called bosonic gaussian channels ( bgcs )  @xcite .",
    "these are completely positive trace preserving maps @xcite , which provide prototypical examples of decoherence processes that occurs in continuous variable ( cv ) systems  @xcite , e.g. in the transmission of optical signals through lossy dispersive optical fibers and/or in free - space   @xcite .",
    "examples of bgcs which are amendable were first discussed in ref  @xcite . moving from those observations , in this paper we propose and discuss in details a feasible quantum optics experiment for the realization and the experimental test of an amendable map using gaussian channels . in particular , having at disposal a two - mode squeezed vacuum state @xcite generated by a type - ii sub  threshold opo @xcite , we show that by suitable passive linear optical manipulations it is possible to realize an eb gaussian channel .",
    "then we prove that it is possible to amend the eb channel in a simple way thus preserving the initial entanglement of the probe state . the proposed experimental set ",
    "up is an effective realization of the conceptual scheme discussed in sec .",

    "the paper is structured as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sect : review ] we present a brief review of the theory of gaussian amendable channels introducing some useful notation ( see [ subsect : notation ] ) and the conceptual theoretical scheme ( see [ subsect : teoscheme ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sect : sketch ] we give a glance over the experimental proposal . in particular we prove that ( see [ subsect : expi ] ) a proper manipulation of the output of a single type ",
    "ii sub  threshold opo is sufficient for generating both an entangled probe state and a local squeezed ancilla .",
    "then , we show that an effective eb channel can be obtained by using only passive optical elements ( see [ subsect : expii ] ) . in sec . [ sect : results ] , we estimate the correlations of the output state looking for suitable experimental conditions that would make eb the resulting map .",
    "then , we find the parameters setting that makes the map effectively amendable . finally , ( see [ subsect : losses ] ) we analyze the feasibility of the experiment in presence of losses , measurement uncertainty and detection inefficiencies .",
    "in this section we review some basic theoretical notions and discuss a simple example of gaussian amendable channel .",
    "a more detailed analysis can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "consider @xmath0 optical radiation modes described by their position and momentum quadrature operators @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath3 , @xmath7 which we group in a vector of @xmath8 components : @xmath9 . such operators can be chosen to be dimensionless so that they obey the canonical commutation rules @xmath10=i\\delta _ { i , j}$ ] , @xmath11=[p_{i},p_{j}]=0 $ ] . to any state @xmath12 of the system we can associate its first and second statistical moments defined respectively by the real vector @xmath13 and by the @xmath14 covariance matrix ( cm ) @xmath15 with entries @xmath16where the symbol @xmath17 indicates expectation values with respect to @xmath12 .",
    "gaussian density matrices are fully characterized once @xmath13 and @xmath15 are assigned  @xcite .",
    "they correspond to states of the @xmath0mode system whose associated characteristic function is gaussian .",
    "examples of gaussian states which will play an important role in the next section are the following pure states : single mode vacuum state , single mode squeezed vacuum state and two - mode squeezed vacuum state ( tmsv ) . according to this notation",
    "the vacuum state is characterized by @xmath18 and @xmath19 the squeezed state by @xmath18 and @xmath20while the tmsv state has @xmath21 and @xmath22gaussian channels are quantum operations which map gaussian states into gaussian states  @xcite .",
    "therefore , they are completely defined by their action on the displacement vector @xmath23 and the matrix @xmath15 . moreover , since the level of entanglement of a state depends only on the correlations and it is insensitive to displacement operations , the action on @xmath13 can be completely neglected for the purpose of the present paper .",
    "in particular in the following we will make extensive use of the transformation associated to a beam splitter of transmissivity @xmath24 . given two input modes with cm",
    "@xmath15 it will produce at the output a two - mode state with cm @xmath25 , where @xmath26if we mix a single mode state with the vacuum on a beam splitter and we trace out one of the output modes we are left with a non - unitary attenuation ( or lossy ) channel @xmath27  @xcite acting on the cms as @xmath28where @xmath29 is the cm of the vacuum given in eq .",
    "( [ vacuum ] ) .",
    "another important single mode operation we will use in the following is the single mode squeezing acting as @xmath30 with @xmath31the previous states , operations and combinations thereof are the main ingredients of the scheme which will be presented in the following .",
    "finally we stress that in a real experiment the cm of , at most , a two  mode state can be fully reconstructed by a single homodyne detection scheme @xcite .",
    "our goal is identifying an experimentally feasible scheme for realizing the paradigms of gaussian amendable channels .",
    "as recalled in the introduction a channel @xmath32 is amendable if it is entanglement breaking of order @xmath33 , i.e. @xmath34 and there exists a unitary filter such that @xmath35 this problem is equivalent to the following one : find a channel @xmath36 and a unitary @xmath37 such that @xmath38 while @xmath39 indeed if eq.s ( [ amend3 ] ) and ( [ amend4 ] ) hold , it is straightforward to check that @xmath40 and @xmath41 satisfy eq.s ( [ amend1 ] ) and ( [ amend2 ] ) in view of the invariance of entanglement under local unitaries .",
    "it turns out that , for gaussian channels , the second problem is simpler to address and therefore in this paper we focus on the latter pair of conditions , eq.s ( [ amend3],[amend4 ] ) .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that an attenuation channel ( eq .  ( [ attenuation ] ) ) and a local squeezing operation ( eq .  ( [ squeezing ] ) ) are valid examples of @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively .",
    "indeed one has that , for some values of the channel transmissivity @xmath24 and squeezing parameter @xmath44 @xmath45 while @xmath46    a natural way to verify that @xmath47 is @xmath48 while @xmath49 is not would be to apply those maps to one part of a maximally entangled state and check whether the initial entanglement is preserved or not . in continuous variables systems , however maximally entangled states are not physically realizable but , as proven in ref .",
    "@xcite , the test can be performed by using a pure two - mode squeezed state with finite entanglement and mean energy .",
    "however , we note here that if the incoming state is mixed , e.g. due to the presence of losses in the state preparation stage , this equivalence property is not valid any more and the output state may result in being separable even if the map is not eb .",
    "it goes without saying that even in this case it may happen that a unitary filter , acting at a proper stage , will restore the lost entanglement .    the theoretical model of this test",
    "is graphically depicted in fig .",
    "fig : simplifiedsetups , where we sketch the scheme of @xmath50 and @xmath51 . in both cases the map",
    "is applied to one side of a tmsv state with squeezing parameter @xmath52 ( see eq .",
    "( [ tmsv ] ) ) . after the application of @xmath50",
    "it has been proved ( see fig .",
    "4a of ref .",
    "@xcite ) that there exists a range of @xmath24 for which the output state is separable . on the other hand , when @xmath51 is applied the output state is always entangled , for all values of @xmath52 and @xmath24 ( see fig .",
    "4b of ref .",
    "the equivalence between eq.s ( [ amend3],[amend4 ] ) and eq.s ( [ amend1],[amend2 ] ) implies that the gaussian map @xmath53 is amendable via a squeezing unitary filter @xmath54",
    ". this theoretical scheme will be our starting point for designing a more realistic experimental proposal .",
    "in this section we propose an experimental set  up in order to realize an effective amendable gaussian map , endowed with the appealing property of being quite simple to be realized in the laboratory .",
    "furthermore , we will also take into account the effects of losses , detection inefficiency and , eventually , measurement indeterminacy .",
    "our starting point is the theoretical model given in fig .",
    "fig : simplifiedsetups .",
    "notice that , even though appearing quite simple , the first set  up associated with the channel @xmath47 in principle requires , in addition to the state preparation part , a non - trivial active operation on the system : the local squeezing between the two beam splitters . in quantum optics active operations can be realized by non - linear interactions . in most squeezing schemes , the initial state ( e.g. vacuum , coherent , squeezed and/or thermal ) interacts with a strong classical field in an optical nonlinear medium .",
    "this can be achieved for example by a sub  threshold optical parametric oscillator ( opo ) @xcite .",
    "compared with passive transformations , active operations are relatively difficult to be engineered and experimentally costly . in order to get around this obstacle , our idea is to use a single initial active operation both for the generation of the entangled ( probe ) state and for the ( indirect ) realization of the local squeezing .",

    "this can be done by measuring the output state of our experimental circuit and checking its separability for different choices of the experimental parameters .",

    "this separability interval has been computed in  @xcite and corresponds to @xmath103 with @xmath104 in the next subsection , we will consider the effects of losses , detection inefficiencies and measurement uncertainties .      in a realistic implementation",
