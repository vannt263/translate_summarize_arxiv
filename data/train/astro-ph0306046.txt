    "gravitational lensing provides us with the most direct method for probing the distribution of matter in the universe @xcite .",
    "lensing leads to a shear distortion of background galaxy images , or a change in the surface number density of background galaxies due to magnification .",
    "the measurement of the mass distribution in clusters of galaxies using the lensing shear @xcite and magnification @xcite are now well established techniques . on larger scales detections of the cosmic shear signal",
    "@xcite show that the cosmological matter distribution can also be probed this way .",
    "the variation of the lensing signal for background galaxies at different redshifts probes the projected lensing mass with different redshift weights in a way that depends on cosmology @xcite .",
    "hu @xcite has developed techniques for using the shear power spectrum for background galaxies with photometric redshift information to constrain cosmological parameters , in particular the nature and evolution of dark energy . his and other recent studies @xcite have forecast the accuracy with which these parameters can be obtained from future weak lensing surveys , while @xcite have developed methods to use tomography for 3-d mass reconstruction .",
    "observationally weak lensing tomography has been applied to a galaxy cluster @xcite , but further progress awaits multi - color imaging surveys that can obtain photometric redshifts of background galaxies .",
    "the lensing shear ( or magnification bias ) can be used to cross - correlate large foreground galaxies ( associated with the lensing mass ) with background galaxies which are lensed . in this paper",
    "we will use such cross - correlations as an alternative way of doing lensing tomography .",
    "we use a particularly simple cross - correlation statistic : the average tangential shear around massive foreground halos associated with galaxy groups and galaxy clusters .",
    "we show that cross - correlation tomography measures ratios of angular diameter distances over a range of redshifts .",
    "the distances are given by integrals of the expansion rate , which in turn depends on the equation of state of the dark energy .",
    "thus it can be used to constrain the evolution of dark energy .",
    "we estimate the accuracy with which dark energy parameters can be measured from future lensing surveys .",
    "we work with the metric @xmath7 ,      \\label{metric}\\ ] ] where we have used the comoving coordinate @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the scale factor as a function of of conformal time @xmath10 .",
    "we adopt units such that @xmath11 .",
    "the comoving angular diameter distance @xmath12 depends on the curvature : we assume a spatially flat universe so that @xmath13 .",
    "the density parameter @xmath14 has contributions from mass density @xmath15 or dark energy density @xmath0 , so that @xmath16 .",
    "the dark energy has equation of state @xmath17 , with @xmath18 corresponding to a cosmological constant .",
    "the hubble parameter @xmath19 is given by @xmath20^{1\\over 2 } , \\label{hubble}\\ ] ] where @xmath21 is the hubble parameter today .",
    "the comoving distance @xmath22 is @xmath23 the lensing convergence is given by the weighted projection of the mass density @xmath24 where the radial weight function @xmath25 can be expressed in terms of @xmath12 and the normalized distribution of background galaxies @xmath26 @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the distance to the horizon .",
    "for a delta - function distribution of background galaxies at @xmath29 , this reduces to @xmath30 .",
    "we consider the lensing induced cross - correlation between massive foreground halos , which are traced by galaxies , and the tangential shear with respect to the halo center ( denoted @xmath31 in this paper ) : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the number density of foreground galaxies with mean redshift @xmath34 , observed in the direction @xmath35 in the sky and @xmath36 .",
    "the angle between directions @xmath35 and @xmath37 is @xmath38 .",
    "the cross - correlation is given by @xcite,@xcite : @xmath39 \\ ; ,   \\label{omegagl}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath40 is the halo - mass cross - power spectrum , and @xmath41 is the foreground halo redshift distribution .",
    "the bessel function @xmath42 has subscript @xmath43 for the tangential shear and @xmath44 for the convergence ( from the relation @xmath45 , @xcite ) .",
    "the measurement of the mean tangential shear around foreground galaxies is called galaxy - galaxy lensing .",
    "we will consider a generalization of this to massive halos that span galaxy groups and clusters .",
    "if the foreground sample has a narrow redshift distribution centered at @xmath46 , then we can take @xmath41 to be a dirac - delta function and evaluate the integral over @xmath8 .",
    "all terms except @xmath47 are then functions of @xmath48 , the redshift of the lensing mass .",
    "the coupling of the foreground and background distributions is contained solely in @xmath47 .",
    "hence if we take the ratio of the cross - correlation for two background populations with mean redshifts @xmath49 and @xmath50 , we get @xmath51 where @xmath52 denote the values of the functions for the background population with mean redshift @xmath49 . in the limit that the background galaxies also have a delta - function distribution , this is simply a ratio of distances @xmath53 the above equations show that the change in the cross - correlation with background redshift does not depend on the galaxy - mass power spectrum , nor on @xmath38 .",
    "we can simply use measurements over a range of @xmath38 to estimate the distance ratio of equation ( [ ratio2 ] ) for each pair of foreground - background redshifts .",
    "the distance ratio in turn depends on the cosmological parameters @xmath54 , @xmath1 , and its evolution @xmath2 .",
    "we evaluate next how the cross - correlation defined above can be used to constrain the dark energy parameters .",
    "this approach is complementary to standard lensing tomography , where the variation of power spectrum of the shear with background redshifts is used to measure an integral of distance and growth factors over redshift . with the cross - correlations ,",
    "there is no dependence on growth factor , but a precise dependence on distances ( since they are not integrated over redshift ) .",
    "a simple way to estimate the signal - to - noise for the cross - correlation approach is to regard the foreground galaxies as providing a template for the shear fields of the background galaxies ( g. bernstein , private communication ) . for a perfect template ( i.e. for high density of foreground galaxies and no biasing ) ,",
    "the errors are solely due to the finite intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies .",
    "thus the fractional error in our measurement of the background shears is simply @xmath55 the total number of background galaxies is @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the survey area , the lensing induced rms shear @xmath58 @xcite , and the intrinsic ellipticity dispersion @xmath59 .",
    "this gives @xmath60 where the number density @xmath61 has units per square arcminute .",
    "thus for the fiducial parameters @xmath62 and @xmath63 , one can expect to measure the background shear to 0.1% accuracy at about 5-@xmath64 .",
    "we find that such a signal corresponds to changes in @xmath1 of a few percent ; hence this is the approximate sensitivity we expect in the absence of systematic errors .      to construct a simple and observationally robust cross - correlation statistic",
    ", we restrict the foreground sample to galaxy clusters and large galaxy groups . with deep imaging surveys ,",
    "most of these massive objects are expected to be identified out to @xmath65 .",
    "we use the tangential component of the shear for two background samples at different redshifts , inside apertures of size @xmath66 , as our estimator of the distance ratio of equation ( [ ratio ] ) .",
    "the signal from all massive halos in a given redshift bin will be stacked for each background sample .",
    "the tangential shear around a foreground halo is @xmath67 where @xmath68 is the geometrical factor that depends on angular diameter distances . to compute the average shear around halos within a mass range ,",
    "one replaces the projected mass density @xmath69 by the projection of the halo - mass correlation function , so that the above equation is equivalent to equation ( [ omegagl ] ) in the limit of thin redshift distributions .",
    "we will assume that the massive foreground halos at @xmath70 have spectroscopic or accurate photometric redshifts , since they generally contain at least one bright galaxy .",
    "each background galaxy sample is described by a redshift distribution determined using photometric redshifts ( which can have relatively large statistical errors ) .",
    "the average tangential shear around foreground galaxies and clusters has proven easier to measure than shear - shear correlations since it is linear in the shear and has a distinct signal that can be distinguished from systematic contributions ( for a wide field survey it is unlikely for a systematic to produce an averaged tangential shear around foreground galaxies ) .",
    "moreover , in comparing the signal for two background populations , it is a great advantage that the shear amplitudes are compared for the same set of apertures on the sky : the relative amplitudes are insensitive to spatial variations of the point spread function , which are the dominant systematic for shear - shear correlations .    to compute the accuracy with which parameters can be measured ,",
    "we need to know the signal and the noise .",
    "the signal is given by equation ( [ omegagl ] ) in which the halo - mass cross - correlation can be accurately computed using the halo model of large - scale structure ( see @xcite for a review ) .",
    "the model specifies @xmath71 , the comoving number density of halos with mass @xmath72 , the bias parameter of halos , and the density profile of a halo for given mass and redshift .",
    "details of the model ingredients relevant to this study are given in @xcite .",
    "the two key quantities for each redshift bin are the number density of halos and the mean shear for each halos mass .",
    "we choose the mass range @xmath73 and aperture size @xmath74 corresponding roughly to the virial radii of halos over the dominant redshift range .",
    "we also set a constant inner aperture @xmath75 to exclude the strong lensing regime and the luminous parts of the lensing halos .",
    "with foreground redshift slices of width @xmath76 , the halos in each slice cover about @xmath77 the survey area . thus using all the foreground slices over @xmath78 , close to the entire survey area",
    "is covered .",
    "we take the background redshift distribution to be given by @xmath79 $ ] , with @xmath80 and @xmath81 and @xmath82 giving a mean redshift of @xmath83 .",
    "we normalize it to give a total number of density @xmath63 per square arcminute .",
    "it is split into two background samples , between @xmath84 and @xmath85 , with about half the galaxies in each sample .",
    "the halo model is used to obtain the mean shear for each lens - source redshift distribution by summing the contributions of halos over the chosen mass range . while we have used the halo model to compute the expected signal - to - noise ,",
    "the inferred parameter values do not rely on knowing the masses or any properties of the halos .",
    "we perform a @xmath86 minimization over the mean shear amplitudes at the two background distributions for each foreground slice to fit for the dark energy parameters .",
    "the time dependence of @xmath1 is parameterized as @xmath87 @xcite . for comparison with other work",
    "we will compare @xmath88 to @xmath2 defined by @xmath89 .",
    "since the @xmath2 parameterization is unsuitable for the large redshift range we use , any comparison with it can be made only for a choice of redshift .",
    "for example , at @xmath90 , which is well probed by our method and is of interest in discriminating dark energy models @xcite , @xmath91 . for foreground slices labeled by index @xmath92 and two background samples by @xmath93 and @xmath94 , the @xmath86",
    "is given by @xmath95 ^ 2          u_{l } ,   \\label{chi2}\\ ] ] where @xmath96 is the distance ratio of equation ( [ ratio ] ) for given values of @xmath97 and @xmath88 , and @xmath98 is the fiducial model with @xmath99 .",
    "the weights @xmath100 are given by @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the fraction of the survey area @xmath57 covered by halo apertures in the @xmath92-th lens slice .",
    "the factor of @xmath94 in the denominator arises because we are using only one component of the measured ellipticity whereas @xmath103 denotes the sum of the variances of both components .",
    "[ fig : omegaw ]    the results are shown in figures [ fig : omegaw ] and [ fig : wdw ] .",
    "figure [ fig : omegaw ] shows the constraints in the @xmath104 plane .",
    "the ellipses show the @xmath105 confidence region given by @xmath106 .",
    "the elongated inner contour is for fixed @xmath107 , while the outer contour marginalizes over @xmath88 ; an external constraint on @xmath0 from the cmb and other probes is assumed , corresponding to @xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig : wdw ] shows the constraints in the @xmath108 plane if @xmath0 is fixed , or marginalized over with @xmath6 .",
    "the corresponding accuracy on @xmath1 and @xmath2 can be scaled as @xmath109 . for @xmath110",
    ", we obtain @xmath3 and @xmath111 ( at @xmath90 this is equivalent to @xmath112 ) .",
    "note that the value of @xmath64 on a parameter is given by projecting the @xmath113 contour on the parameter axis , which is smaller than the projection of the inner contour in figure [ fig : wdw ] with @xmath106 .",
    "the scaling with @xmath5 in the parmameter errors comes from the number of background galaxies ( not sample variance ) , hence for given @xmath5 varying the depth of the survey scales the errors roughly as @xmath114 .",
    "the results we have shown are for the fiducial redshift @xmath115 . a different choice of the fiducial redshift changes the relative accuracy on @xmath1 and @xmath88 somewhat , because the degeneracy direction in the three parameters changes",
    ". a detailed exploration of different models of @xmath116 with finer bins in the background redshift distribution would be of interest .",
    "the parameter constraints obtained above are consistent with the crude signal - to - noise estimate made above in equation ( [ sn2 ] ) .",
    "this can be seen by using representative numbers for the halos used in the cross correlation . for @xmath117 , the number density @xmath118 per ln interval in @xmath72 integrated out to @xmath90 , while the mean shear inside @xmath119 is @xmath120 for @xmath121 and @xmath122 @xcite . thus using halos with a mass range of over one decade centered on @xmath117",
    "gives close to full sky coverage .",
    "for relevant scales , the shear profile around the halo center is close to the isothermal form : @xmath123 .",
    "the signal - to - noise is then constant per log @xmath38 since the noise variance scales as the area ( @xmath124 ) .",
    "we will use the simple scheme of stacking all halos , and averaging over the mean shear inside apertures , to estimate the signal .",
    "the noise per unit area is @xmath125 .",
    "using the numbers given above for @xmath126 and the noise gives a signal - to - noise estimate in agreement with equation ( [ sn2 ] ) as well as the results shown in figures [ fig : omegaw ] and [ fig : wdw ] .",
    "[ fig : wdw ]",
    "we have presented a method of lensing tomography that uses foreground halos associated with the lensing mass to measure angular diameter distances over a range of redshifts , @xmath127 .",
    "it offers an observationally robust probe of dark energy and its evolution over this redshift range .",
    "the accuracy achievable with a lensing survey that covers 1/10 of the sky ( with parameters close to that of the survey proposed with the lsst telescope ) is potentially one of the most promising for proposed surveys in the coming decade .",
    "it is complementary with constraints from type 1a supernovae in that the redshift coverage is broader while the distance factors probed are similar @xcite .",
    "combining cross - correlation tomography with the standard shear power spectrum tomography improves the constraints significantly , since the contour ellipses are oriented differently @xcite  this is especially appealing because the two techinques use the data in different regimes , the linear and strongly nonlinear regime .",
    "further it would allow the constraints on the dark matter , such as on neutrino mass , from shear power spectrum tomography to be improved by providing independent information on the geometry .",
    "an attractive feature of cross - correlation tomography is its observational feasibility .",
    "the main practical advantages are : ( i ) large shear values ( @xmath128 ) around massive halos are used , and ( ii ) linear shear amplitudes are compared in the _ same _ apertures on the sky .",
    "the statistic is thus largely insensitive to the primary limiting systematic error in weak lensing surveys : the variation of the point spread function over the field view ( to first order the psf variation averages to zero for a linear statistic ) .",
    "the imaging requirements are far less stringent than for other cosmological applications of lensing , such as standard tomography , which rely on the measurement of quadratic shear correlations at large angles .",
    "the ongoing cfh legacy survey should allow for testing of the method and parameter constraints that can be checked with limits from the cmb .",
    "the limiting systematic error for most surveys is likely come from the photometric redshifts of the background galaxies . while large statistical errors do not affect the parameter constraints significantly",
    ", systematic errors could bias the inferred distance ratios . calibrating a fair sub - sample of the photometric redshifts with spectroscopic redshifts , and testing for effects such as possible correlations between measured ellipticites and the sizes or surface brightness of galaxies ,",
    "should allow us to safeguard against such biases @xcite .",
    "we have assumed in this study that the intrinsic ellipticities of background galaxies dominate the statistical errors .",
    "other sources of errors are projection effects due to matter at different redshifts from the foreground halo and intrinsic correlations in the ellipticies of background galaxies .",
    "our choice of averaging the tangential shears around halos should cause these errors to not bias the result , but a careful study is needed to quantify the contribution to the statistical error .",
    "a possible bias can be introduced if the foreground redshifts have large errors and the halo selection , based on visible galaxies , is perversely correlated with dark energy evolution . statistical accuracy in the foreground redshifts of better than 0.1 in @xmath129",
    "should rule out such a bias due to cosmological evolution , but again a more detailed study is needed .",
    "our implementation of halo - shear cross - correlations is not optimal in that we have used only a fraction of the measured shapes for each lens slice , and only two bins of the background galaxies ( motivated in part by the finding that this provides most of the information in shear power spectrum tomography @xcite ) .",
    "the parameter accuracy can therefore be improved with an optimal scheme in which we use finer binning or the actual redshifts ( or photometric redshift probability distributions ) of foreground and background galaxies rather than binning them .",
    "it will also be of interest to study different models of @xmath130 rather than the monotonic parameterization used here , or to obtain model independent constraints on the expansion history directly @xcite . a joint analysis with shear - shear correlations is needed to quantify the improved precision one can expect .",
    "we have restricted ourselves to the weak lensing shear ; additional information can be obtained by using the strong lensing signal expected in some fraction of the galaxy and cluster halos ( for related studies with lensing arcs from galaxy clusters , see @xcite ) and using the magnification signal .    _",
