    "the discovery of the tight correlation between black hole mass and the velocity dispersion of the bulge component of galaxies @xcite supports the scenario that the black holes have grown up in mass through the hierarchical galaxy mergers .",
    "this scenario inevitably would lead to the formation of the supermassive binary black holes ( smbbhs ) during the course of galaxy mergers .",
    "however , there has so far been little observational direct evidence of the smbbhs on the subparsec scale @xcite .",
    "if there is the gas orbiting around the smbbhs on the subparsec scale , one will be able to observe a signal arising from the interaction between the binary and its surrounding gas ( i.e. a circumbinary disk ) .",
    "therefore , we study the accretion onto the smbbhs from the circumbinary disks , performing the 3d smoothed particles hydrodynamic ( sph ) simulations .",
    "our simulations were performed by using the same 3d sph code as @xcite . in order to investigate the accretion flows from the circumbinary disk",
    ", we run the simulation with the shakura - sunyaev viscosity parameter @xmath0 throughout the circumbinary disk which is coplanar with the orbital plane .",
    "the orbital period @xmath1 is about @xmath2 , the eccentricity @xmath3 is 0.5 , and the total black holes masses @xmath4 with the mass ratio @xmath5 .",
    "the black holes are modeled by a couple of sink particles with the accretion radius @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the semi - major axis of the binary .",
    "the isothermal equation of state is adopted with @xmath8 , which approximately equals to the typical effective temperature of a standard disk at the @xmath6 around a single black hole with @xmath9 .",
    "1 shows the accretion flow onto the smbbhs ( the left panel ) and the orbital phase dependence of the mass - accretion rate onto the black holes ( right panel ) , respectively . from the left panel of fig .  1",
    ", we note that the mass can inflow via two points at the inner edge of the circumbinary disk onto the black holes , and then the accretion disks are formed around each of black holes . in the right panel of fig.1 , to reduce the fluctuation noise , the data are folded on the orbital period over @xmath10 . from the figure , we note that the mass accretion rate strongly depends on the binary orbital phase .    .",
    "annotated in the panel are the time in units of @xmath1 and the number of sph particles @xmath11 . in the right panel ,",
    "the right axis shows the bolometric luminosity corresponding to the mass - accretion rate with the energy conversion efficiency , @xmath12 , normalized by the eddington luminosity with total black hole mass @xmath4 .",

    "we have carried out the sph simulations of accretion flows from circumbinary disks onto the smbbhs on the subparsec scale .",

    "the mass accretion rate significantly varies with an orbital motion because of the periodic variations of the binary potential .",
