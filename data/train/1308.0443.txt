    "a second 5.5 m radius nylon outer vessel ( ov ) surrounds the iv , acting as a barrier against radon and other background contamination originating from outside .",
    "the region between the iv and the ov contains a passive shield composed of pc and a small quantity of dmp ( dimethylphthalate ) , a material that quenches the residual scintillation of pc so that scintillation signals arise dominantly from the interior of the iv  @xcite .",
    "the concentration of dmp in pc was 5.0g / l at the beginning of data taking and was later reduced to 3.0g / l ( and then to 2.0g / l ) to mitigate the effects of a small leak in the iv ( discussed in subsection  [ subsec : leak ] ) . a 6.85 m radius stainless steel sphere ( sss ) encloses the central part of the detector and serves also as a support structure for the 2212 8 \" ( etl 9351 ) pmts .",
    "the region between the ov and the sss is filled with the same inert buffer fluid ( pc plus dmp ) which is layered between the iv and the ov .",

    "the i d is contained in a tank ( 9 m base radius , 16.9 m height ) filled by ultra  pure water . the total liquid passive shielding of the central volume from external radiation ( such as that originating from the rock ) is thus 5.5 m of water equivalent .",

    "key elements determining the success of the experiment were also the many liquid purification and handling systems  @xcite , which were designed and installed to ensure the proper fluid manipulation at the exceptional purity level demanded by borexino .",

    "the first underground operation was the pc transfer via a dedicated unloading station to four big reservoir tanks . taken from this storage area , the pc was first purified via distillation , then either mixed with ppo for insertion in the iv or mixed with dmp for the insertion in the buffer region .",
    "furthermore , the ppo was pre - mixed with a limited quantity of pc in a dedicated ppo system , originating a concentrated ppo solution which was then mixed in line with the pc .",
    "other important ancillary plants are the n@xmath29 systems , which deliver regular , or on site purified , or specially produced n@xmath29 .",
    "the last one has exceptionally low content of @xmath30ar and @xmath31kr , to be used for the crucial manipulations of the liquid in the iv .",

    "the selection of the low radioactivity materials , the liquid handling procedures , the purification strategies , and many scintillator properties have been tested using a prototype of borexino called counting test facility ( ctf ) . this detector ( @xmath325m@xmath33 vessel filled by an organic liquid scintillator viewed by 100 pmts ) collected data from the year 1995 until the year 2011 in hall c of the laboratori nazionali del gran sasso in italy .",

    "was reduced by partial removal of dmp from the buffer by distillation . between february 12@xmath34 , 2009 and april 3@xmath37 , 2009",
    "the buffer liquid was purified and the dmp concentration reduced from 5g / l to 3g / l , thus reducing the density difference between the scintillator and the buffer and in turn the buoyant forces on the iv .",
    "this reduced the leak rate to about 0.56m@xmath33/month , and greatly reduced the number of scintillation events occurring in the buffer . in december 2009",
    "it was decided to further reduce the dmp concentration to 2",
    "g / l , to approach neutral buoyancy between buffer and scintillator .",
    "this concentration is still high enough to suppress the pc scintillation in the buffer . following this operation , concluded at the end of january 2010 , the leak rate",
    "was further reduced to @xmath31.5m@xmath33/year .",
    "the iv shape appeared to be stabilized .",
    "the lost scintillator volume in the iv was compensated by several refilling operations using pc .",
    "solar neutrinos of all flavors are detected by means of their elastic scattering off electrons : @xmath38 in the elastic scattering process only a fraction of the neutrino energy @xmath39 is transferred to an electron and the interaction of the latter with the medium originates the scintillation signal .",

    "the radiative corrections change monotonically the electron recoil spectrum for incident @xmath6b solar neutrinos , with the relative probability of observing recoil electrons being reduced by about 4% at the highest electron energies . for @xmath1 and @xmath0be solar neutrinos , the recoil spectra are not affected significantly .",
    "borexino can detect neutrinos of all flavors , but @xmath4 have a larger cross section than @xmath11 and @xmath12 , because @xmath4 interact through both charged current ( cc ) and neutral current ( nc ) , while @xmath11 and @xmath12 interact only via the nc .",

    "neutrinos from different reactions are produced in the sun at different radii @xcite and the electron density in the sun decreases with increasing radius .",

    "the band refers to the @xmath6b neutrinos and was obtained averaging the value of @xmath119 for each energy calculated for different radii ( that is different @xmath121 ) in the sun according to the proper radial distribution of the production point of the @xmath6b@xmath49 s .",
    "the width of the curve is due to the uncertainties ( 1@xmath17 ) associated with the mixing angles and @xmath14 .",
    "the plot also shows the value of the @xmath119 calculated for the mono ",

    "similarly , points at mean energies of @xmath25 , cno , and @xmath127 neutrino fluxes ( having continuous energy spectra ) are also included . from this figure",
    "we see that the dependence of the survival probability from the neutrino production region in the sun is small and it is masked by current uncertainties .",

    "a combined analysis of the borexino data together with those of other solar experiments allows to obtain also the values of survival probability for the @xmath25 and @xmath6b neutrinos .",
    "figure  [ fig : exppee ] reports the results .",
    "the rich scientific harvest of the borexino phase - i was made possible by the extreme radio  purity of the detector and of its liquid scintillator core in particular . challenging design purity levels have been mostly met , and , in some cases , surpassed by a few orders of magnitude .",
    "the central physics goal was achieved with the 5% measurement of the @xmath0be solar neutrino rate .",
    "three more measurements beyond the scope of the original proposal were made as well : the first observation of the solar @xmath1 neutrinos , the most stringent experimental constraint on the flux of cno neutrinos , and the low - threshold measurement of the @xmath6b solar neutrino interaction rate .",
    "the latter measurement was possible thanks to the extremely low background rate above natural radioactivity , while the first two exploited the superior particle identification capability of the scintillator and an efficient cosmogenic background subtraction .",
    "all measurements benefit from an extensive calibration campaign with radioactive sources that preserved scintillator radio  purity .",
    "in this paper we have described the sources of background and the data analysis methods that led to the published solar neutrinos results .",
    "we also reported , for the first time , the detection of the annual modulation of the @xmath0be solar neutrino rate , consistent with their solar origin . the implications of borexino solar neutrino results for neutrino and solar physics were also discussed , both stand  alone and in combination with other solar neutrino data .",
    "borexino has performed several purification cycles in 2010 and 2011 by means of water extraction  @xcite in batch mode , reducing even further several background components , among which @xmath31kr , @xmath53bi , and the @xmath138u and @xmath139th chains .",
    "after these purification cycles , the borexino phase - ii has started at the beginning of 2012 , with the goal of improving all solar neutrino measurements .",
    "borexino is also an ideal apparatus to look for short baseline neutrino oscillations into sterile species using strong artificial neutrino and anti ",
    "neutrino sources @xcite .",
    "an experimental program , called sox ( source oscillation experiment ) , was approved and it is now in progress .    the borexino program is made possible by funding from infn ( italy ) , nsf ( usa ) , bmbf , dfg and mpg ( germany ) , nrc kurchatov institute ( russia ) and ncn ( poland ) .",
