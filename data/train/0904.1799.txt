    "the landau theory of fermi liquids has a long history and remarkable results in describing the properties of electron liquid in ordinary metals and fermi liquids of @xmath1he type .",
    "the theory is based on the landau paradigm that elementary excitations determine the physics at low temperatures .",
    "these excitations behave as quasiparticles , have a certain effective mass @xmath2 , which is independent of temperature @xmath3 , number density @xmath4 , and magnetic field strength @xmath5 and is a parameter of the theory @xcite . the discovery of strongly correlated fermi systems represented by heavy - fermion ( hf ) metals and 2d @xmath1he exhibiting the non - fermi liquid ( nfl ) behavior has opened tremendous challenges in the modern condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "facts collected on hf metals and 2d @xmath1he demonstrate that the effective mass strongly depends on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc , while @xmath2 itself can reach very high values or even diverge @xcite .",
    "such a behavior is so unusual that the traditional landau quasiparticles paradigm does not apply to it .",
    "there is a common wisdom that quantum criticality , describing the collective fluctuations of matter undergoing a second - order phase transition at zero temperature , suppresses quasiparticles and thus generates the nfl behavior , depending on the initial ground state , either magnetic or superconductive @xcite .",
    "earlier , a concept of fermion condensation quantum phase transition ( fcqpt ) preserving quasiparticles and intimately related to the unlimited growth of @xmath2 , had been suggested @xcite .",
    "further studies show that it is capable to deliver an adequate theoretical explanation of vast majority of experimental results in different hf metals @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the landau paradigm based on the assumption that @xmath2 is a constant , in fcqpt approach @xmath2 strongly depends on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc .",
    "therefore , in accord with numerous experimental facts the extended quasiparticles paradigm is to be introduced .",
    "the main point here is that the well - defined quasiparticles determine as before the thermodynamic and transport properties of strongly correlated fermi - systems , while @xmath2 becomes a function of @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc @xcite .",
    "the fcqpt approach had been already successfully applied to describe the thermodynamic properties of such different strongly correlated systems as @xmath1he on one side and complicated heavy - fermion ( hf ) compounds on the other side @xcite .    in this letter",
    ", we analyze the non - fermi liquid behavior of strongly correlated fermi systems using the density functional theory of fermion condensation @xcite .",
    "we derive equations for the effective mass of quasiparticles in both homogeneous systems and solids with a lattice , and show that extended quasiparticles paradigm is valid , while the dependence of the effective mass on @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 etc gives rise to the nfl behavior .",
    "the obtained results are illustrated with calculations of the thermodynamic and transport functions of strongly correlated fermi - systems .",
    "possible energy scales in these functions are discussed .",
    "we demonstrate that our calculations of the heat capacity @xmath6 , magnetization @xmath7 , energy scales , longitudinal magnetoresistance ( lmr ) and magnetic entropy @xmath8 are in good agreement with striking recent facts collected on the hf metal @xmath0 @xcite .",

    "tends to zero so that the effective mass diverges at @xmath9 @xcite , and the system undergoes fcqpt .",
    "it follows from eq .",
    "that beyond the critical point @xmath18 , the effective mass becomes negative . to avoid an unstable and physically meaningless state with a negative effective mass ,",
    "the system must undergo a quantum phase transition at the quantum critical point @xmath17 , which is fcqpt @xcite .",
    "the asymmetrical phase behind the quantum critical point is determined by @xmath19 here @xmath20 is the ground state energy , @xmath21 is a chemical potential , and @xmath22 is the occupation numbers of quasiparticles .",
    "the main result of such reconstruction is that instead of fermi step , we have @xmath23 in certain range of momenta @xmath24 .",
    "accordingly , the single - particle spectrum @xmath25 in the above momenta interval becomes flat , @xmath26 , and this state is known as a fermi condensate ( fc ) state @xcite . due to the above peculiarities of the @xmath27 function , fc state",
    "is characterized by the superconducting order parameter @xmath28 .",
    "to derive equation determining the effective mass , we employ the density functional theory of superconducting state @xcite . in that case",

    "as we will see this feature of @xmath2 forms the nfl behavior observed in measurements on hf metals .",
    "to avoid difficulties associated with the anisotropy generated by the crystal lattice of solids , we study the universal behavior of heavy - fermion metals using the model of the homogeneous heavy - electron ( fermion ) liquid .",
    "the model is quite meaningful because we consider the universal behavior exhibited by these materials at low temperatures , a behavior related to power - law divergences of quantities such as the effective mass , the heat capacity , the magnetization , etc .",
    "these divergences and scaling behavior of the effective mass , or the critical exponents that characterize them , are determined by energy and momentum transfers that are small compared to the debye characteristic temperature and momenta of the order of the reciprocal lattice cell length @xmath40 .",
    "therefore quasiparticles are influenced by the crystal lattice averaged over big distances compared to the length @xmath41 .",
    "thus , we can substitute the well - known jelly model for the lattice as it is usually done , for example , in the fluctuation theory of second order phase transitions .",
    "the schematic phase diagram of hf liquid is reported in fig .",
    "magnetic field @xmath5 is taken as the control parameter .",

    "the temperature region @xmath54 signifies the crossover between the lfl regime with almost constant effective mass and nfl behavior , given by @xmath53 dependence .",

    "near temperatures @xmath63 the last `` traces '' of lfl regime disappear , the second term starts to dominate , and again eq . becomes homogeneous , and the nfl behavior restores , manifesting itself in decreasing of @xmath2 as @xmath53 . when the system is near fcqpt , it turns out that the solution of eq",

    "as we will see it is this dependence that forms the nfl behavior .",
    "it follows also from eq . that a scaling behavior of @xmath2 near fcqpt point is determined by the absence of appropriate external physical scales to measure the effective mass and temperature . at fixed magnetic fields , the characteristic scales of temperature and of the function @xmath80 are defined by both @xmath75 and @xmath51 respectively . at fixed temperatures ,",

    "a few remarks are in order here .",
    "as we shall see in subsections iv c and d , in some cases temperature or magnetic field dependencies of the effective mass or of other observable like the longitudinal magnetoresistance do not have `` peculiar points '' like maximum .",
    "the normalization are to be performed in the other points like the inflection point shown in the inset to fig .",
    "such a normalization is possible since it is established on the internal scales .",

    "with special form of landau interaction amplitude , see refs .",
    "@xcite for details .",
    "choice of the amplitude is dictated by the fact that the system has to be in the fcqpt point , which means that first two @xmath15-derivatives of the single - particle spectrum @xmath87 should equal zero . since first derivative is proportional to the reciprocal quasiparticle effective mass @xmath88 , its zero ( where @xmath89 and the effective mass diverges ) just signifies fcqpt .",
    "zeros of two subsequent derivatives mean that the spectrum @xmath87 has an inflection point at fermi momentum @xmath13 so that the lowest term of its taylor expansion is proportional to @xmath90 @xcite .",
