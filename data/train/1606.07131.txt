    "the study of the magnetization dynamics in single - domain ferromagnetic particles ( nanoparticles ) is of large importance for both fundamental research and practical applications .",
    "the dynamical effects related to a sudden change in the magnetization behavior , which occurs as a control parameter is varied , are of the greatest interest .",
    "one of these effects is the switching ( or reversal ) of the nanoparticle magnetization . depending on the application , the switching process has to be properly optimized . in particular , to reduce the switching time and switching magnetic field in magnetic recording devices , the so - called precessional switching@xcite and microwave - assisted switching@xcite have recently been proposed .",
    "the magnetic resonances in nanoparticles and transitions between different dynamical states of the magnetization can also play an important role in hyperthermia,@xcite because a strong change of nanoparticle heating is expected to occur in the vicinity of these resonances and transitions .",
    "a remarkable feature of the deterministic dynamics of magnetization in nanoparticles driven by periodic magnetic fields is that it can be chaotic .",
    "@xcite from a theoretical point of view , the transitions between the regular and chaotic regimes of the magnetization dynamics and routes to chaos have a special interest .",
    "the nonlinear magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic nanoparticles driven by a circularly - polarized magnetic field is well studied for the particular case of uniaxial nanoparticles , whose easy axes are perpendicular to the polarization plane@xcite ( see also ref .  [ ] and references therein ) . using the deterministic landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation,@xcite",
    "these authors have shown that the magnetization dynamics is always regular and , in the steady state , only periodic and quasiperiodic dynamical regimes exist .",
    "in addition , the stability conditions for periodic regimes and induced magnetization are derived in,@xcite the phase diagram of possible regimes in the plane ` amplitude  frequency ' of the driving magnetic field is obtained in,@xcite the power loss for periodic regimes is calculated in,@xcite and the influence of transitions between different dynamical regimes on the power loss is studied in.@xcite some thermal effects in such systems , including thermal enhancement of the induced magnetization and resonant suppression of thermal stability of these regimes , are investigated in.@xcite    due to the symmetry of the model , many of the above results were obtained analytically . at the same time , a number of important features of the magnetization dynamics ( e.g. , some higher - order resonances and chaotic dynamics ) are symmetrically forbidden in this model .",
    "therefore , in this paper we consider a more general case when the driving field is elliptically polarized and the nanoparticle easy axis has a random direction . here , our interest is focused on understanding how the nonlinear resonances and transitions between different regimes of the magnetization dynamics affect the magnetic properties of nanoparticle systems .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in sec .",
    "[ gen ] , we describe the model , introduce the basic equations , and define the quantities of interest . a general perturbation theory for the llg equation",
    "is developed in sec .",
    "[ pert ] . in the same section , we determine the steady - state solution of this equation in the first and second orders of the perturbation theory .",
    "section [ magn ] is devoted to studying the average magnetization of the reference system induced by the elliptically polarized magnetic field .",
    "the dependence of the power loss on the magnetic field amplitude and frequency is studied in sec .",
    "[ power ] .",
    "finally , our results are summarized and discussed in sec .",
    "[ concl ] .",
    "we consider a system of ferromagnetic nanoparticles driven by the magnetic field @xmath0 , which is elliptically polarized in the @xmath1 plane , i.e. , @xmath2 here , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are , respectively , the amplitude and angular frequency of the magnetic field , @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the unit vectors of the cartesian coordinate system @xmath8 , and @xmath9 is the dimensionless parameter .",
    "the sign of this parameter characterizes the direction of field rotation ( at @xmath10 the magnetic field rotates in the clockwise direction and at @xmath11 in the counterclockwise direction ) , and its values @xmath12 and @xmath13 correspond to the linearly and circularly polarized magnetic fields .",
    "the nanoparticles of the system are assumed to be non - interacting and single - domain ( this is so - called stoner - wohlfarth particles@xcite ) , and distributed in an insulating matrix .",
    "the only difference between them is the direction of their anisotropy axes ( easy axes ) that , for each nanoparticle , is characterized by the unit vector @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are the polar and azimuthal angles of @xmath17 . in the following analysis , we assume that the directions of this vector are random and uniformly distributed over the sphere .",
    "this means that the angles @xmath15 and @xmath16 are also random and their joint probability density @xmath18 that @xmath19 and @xmath20 is given by @xmath21    the magnetic state of each nanoparticle in the system is described by the magnetization vector @xmath22 , whose dynamics is governed by the deterministic llg equation@xcite @xmath23 here , @xmath24 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath25 is the dimensionless damping parameter , @xmath26 , and the cross sign denotes the vector product . the effective magnetic field @xmath27 acting on the magnetization is taken in the following form : @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the magnetic anisotropy field and the dot denotes the scalar product . introducing the dimensionless magnetization , @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) , and the dimensionless effective magnetic field , @xmath32 , the llg equation ( [ llg ] ) can be reduced to the form @xmath33 here , @xmath34 , the overdot denotes differentiation with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath35 , @xmath36 is the characteristic angular frequency of the magnetization precession , and , according to ( [ h ] ) and ( [ h_eff ] ) , @xmath37 with @xmath38 and @xmath39 being , respectively , the dimensionless amplitude and dimensionless angular frequency of the driving magnetic field @xmath40 .",
    "because the direction of @xmath17 is random , the dynamics of @xmath41 in different nanoparticles of the system is , in general , different .",
    "therefore , the average magnetic properties of nanoparticles play a key role in describing the corresponding magnetic properties of such a system .    in this paper , we are interested in two characteristics of nanoparticles .",
    "the first is the average dimensionless magnetization , @xmath42 , induced by the elliptically polarized magnetic field . here",
    ", the overbar denotes averaging over the dimensionless time interval @xmath43 , @xmath44 and the angular brackets denote averaging over all possible orientations of the unit vector @xmath17 , @xmath45 it should be noted that the choice of @xmath43 depends on the dynamical regimes of @xmath41 . in particular , in the case of the steady - state dynamics the time interval @xmath43 should be chosen as @xmath46 .",
    "in contrast , if @xmath41 exhibits chaotic dynamics , then the following condition should be satisfied : @xmath47 .",
    "the second quantity of our interest is the reduced power loss defined as @xmath48 , where @xmath49 is the instantaneous power loss per nanoparticle of the volume @xmath50 . using the llg equation ( [ llg ] )",
    ", this quantity can be written as follows : @xmath51 if the nanoparticle system of the volume @xmath52 contains @xmath53 nanoparticles , then the induced magnetization and power loss density for this system are expressed through the above introduced quantities @xmath54 and @xmath55 as @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , where @xmath58 is the concentration of nanoparticles .",
    "let us now formulate the conditions under which this model is justified .",
    "first of all , we assume that the strength of the exchange interaction between spins is the largest energy scale in the model . in this case , the magnetization magnitude is approximately constant and the magnetization rotation can be described by the llg equation ( [ llg ] ) . since the rotation is considered to be coherent , the nanoparticles should be single - domain .",
    "this implies that the nanoparticle diameter @xmath59 must be less than some critical value @xmath60 which , depending on the material , ranges from a few nanometers to several tens or even hundreds of nanometers ( for example , @xmath61 for @xmath62 , @xmath63 for @xmath64 , and @xmath65 for @xmath66@xcite ) . in general , because of thermal fluctuations , the coherent rotation of magnetization in nanoparticles with @xmath67 is random . in the framework of the stochastic llg equation ,",
    "these fluctuations are usually accounted for by adding a gaussian white noise to the effective magnetic field@xcite ( for recent reviews see , e.g. , refs .",
    "[ ] and [ ] and references therein ) .",
    "however , if the thermal energy @xmath68 ( @xmath69 is the boltzmann constant , @xmath70 is the absolute temperature ) is much less than the smallest energy scale in the system , @xmath71 ( @xmath72 is the scale energy density ) , than thermal fluctuations can safely be neglected .",
    "this occurs at @xmath73 , and thus the magnetization is homogeneous and its dynamics is approximately deterministic if the nanoparticle diameter satisfies the conditions @xmath74 .",
    "the condition @xmath75 can also be used to evaluate the maximum temperature at which the deterministic approximation still holds ( this is the case if the maximum temperature is less than the blocking temperature ) . note that these conditions are not too restrictive and in some cases can be satisfied even at room temperatures.@xcite    in addition , we use the approximation of non - interacting nanoparticles , i.e. , the average interparticle distance @xmath76 is assumed to be so large that the total magnetic field produced by the surrounding nanoparticles is negligibly small compared to the anisotropy and external magnetic fields . in the dipole approximation , this distance can roughly be estimated from the condition @xmath77 . at first sight , even with the above assumptions , the choice of the effective magnetic field in the form ( [ h_eff ] ) is still not satisfactory .",
    "the reason is that @xmath78 does not contain the demagnetizing magnetic field , which always exists in ferromagnetic samples and , in general , can not be neglected .",
    "but in the case of single - domain particles of spherical shape the demagnetizing field equals @xmath79 and , since @xmath80 , this field does not influence the magnetization dynamics and can be ignored in @xmath81 .",
    "note that our approach can also be applied to conducting nanoparticles .",
    "this is because the main effect of conductivity is the renormalization of the damping parameter @xmath82.@xcite finally , according to the definition ( [ mean2 ] ) , the quantities of our interest , @xmath42 and @xmath55 , depend on the probability density @xmath18 of easy axis directions .",
    "the choice of the uniform distribution for these directions is motivated by both physical ( zero magnetization of non - driving systems ) and mathematical ( simple integration over the angles @xmath83 and @xmath84 ) reasons .",
    "however , any other choice of @xmath18 is also possible ; the only problem in this case is the analytical calculation of the integrals in ( [ mean2 ] ) .",
    "assuming that @xmath85 , we represent the reduced magnetization @xmath41 in the series form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the contribution to @xmath41 in the @xmath88-th approximation ( @xmath89 ) . due to the condition @xmath90",
    ", there are strong connections between @xmath91 with different @xmath88 . indeed",
    ", using the fact that @xmath92 , the condition @xmath90 can be written as @xmath93 since the set of vectors @xmath91 , which are introduced instead of the single vector @xmath41 , is infinite , one may require that the condition ( [ cond_m=1 ] ) holds in all orders of the perturbation theory , implying that each sum of terms that have the same order equals zero . in this case , for the terms of odd ( @xmath94",
    ", @xmath95 is a natural number ) and even ( @xmath96 ) orders one respectively obtains @xmath97 and @xmath98 thus , although @xmath91 is determined in the @xmath88-th step of approximation , the scalar product @xmath99 can be calculated using @xmath100 obtained in the previous steps ( i.e. , at @xmath101 ) .",
    "this property of @xmath91 plays an important role in our analysis .",
    "note also that for @xmath102 the sums in the right - hand sides of expressions ( [ order_2p-1 ] ) and ( [ order_2p ] ) equal zero , and so @xmath103    the series representation for the dimensionless effective magnetic field reads @xmath104 where , according to ( [ h_eff ] ) , ( [ ser_m ] ) and ( [ 1-st,2-nd ] ) , @xmath105 , @xmath106 , and @xmath107 at @xmath108 . substituting the series ( [ ser_m ] ) and ( [ ser_h ] ) into the reduced llg equation ( [ red_llg ] ) and keeping the terms of the @xmath88-th order in @xmath109 , we find the following first - order differential equation for @xmath91 : @xmath110 finally , by separating the terms with @xmath91 , this equation reduces to @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) .",
    "its right - hand side , @xmath113 , is given by @xmath114 and , due to the conditions ( [ order_2p-1 ] ) and ( [ order_2p ] ) , it does not depend on @xmath91 .",
    "thus , eq .  ( [ eq_m_n2 ] ) is linear in @xmath91 , and @xmath115 is a given function of @xmath116 , which is determined by solving this equation with respect to @xmath100 for @xmath101 .",
    "in particular , in the first ( @xmath117 ) and second ( @xmath118 ) approximations the definition ( [ def_f_n ] ) , together with the conditions ( [ 1-st,2-nd ] ) , yields @xmath119 and @xmath120      & & + \\,(\\alpha/2)\\mathbf{m }      _ { 1}^{2 } \\mathbf{e}_{a}.      \\label{def_h_2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    to write the vector formula ( [ def_f_n ] ) in the component form , it is convenient to introduce a right - handed cartesian coordinate system @xmath121 characterized by the unit vectors @xmath122 , @xmath123 and @xmath17 . the vector @xmath17 is defined by ( [ e_a ] ) , and the others may be defined in the following way ( see , e.g. , ref .",

    "<S> we study the effect of an elliptically polarized magnetic field on a system of non - interacting , single - domain ferromagnetic nanoparticles characterized by a uniform distribution of easy axis directions . </S>",
    "<S> our main goal is to determine the average magnetization of this system and the power loss in it . in order to calculate these quantities analytically </S>",
    "<S> , we develop a general perturbation theory for the landau - lifshitz - gilbert ( llg ) equation and find its steady - state solution for small magnetic field amplitudes . on this basis </S>",
    "<S> , we derive the second - order expressions for the average magnetization and power loss , investigate their dependence on the magnetic field frequency , and analyze the role of subharmonic resonances resulting from the nonlinear nature of the llg equation . for arbitrary amplitudes , the frequency dependence of these quantities is obtained from the numerical solution of this equation . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of transitions between different regimes of regular and chaotic dynamics of magnetization , which can be induced in nanoparticles by changing the magnetic field frequency , is examined in detail . </S>"
