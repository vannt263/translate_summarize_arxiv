    "the steady - state sedimentation of spheres in a viscous medium at low reynolds ( re ) number is an important model problem in non - equilibrium statistical mechanics , exhibiting subtle and interesting physics @xcite .",
    "some properties are relatively straightforward to determine .",
    "for example , the sedimentation velocity @xmath2 of a single sphere was first calculated over 150 years ago by george gabriel stokes@xcite to be @xmath3 , where @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the radius the density of the sphere , @xmath6 is the gravitational acceleration , and @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the density and viscosity of the fluid . on the other hand , even the first order effect of finite volume fraction @xmath9 ( @xmath10 is the particle number density ) , was not calculated until 1972 when batchelor @xcite showed that @xmath11 the effect of a finite volume fraction on sedimentation is dominated by long - ranged hydrodynamic forces that decay with interparticle distance @xmath12 as slowly as @xmath13 .",
    "these forces are hard to treat analytically because they can easily lead to spurious divergences .",
    "( [ eq1.2 ] ) also highlights the strong effect of the hydrodynamic forces .",
    "for example , a naive application of this lowest order result would suggest that all sedimentation should stop at @xmath14 . of course",
    "this is not true since there are important higher order corrections in @xmath15 whose calculation remains an active topic of research  @xcite .",
    "if the influence of hydrodynamics on the average sedimentation velocity at finite volume fraction is non - trivial to calculate , then the fluctuations around that average would appear even more formidable to determine . in a remarkable paper , caflish and",
    "luke @xcite used a simple scaling argument to predict that , for a homogeneous suspension , the velocity fluctuations @xmath16 should diverge as @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the smallest container size .",
    "this surprising result stimulated much theoretical and experimental work , as well as no small amount of controversy @xcite .",
    "particle velocimetry experiments clearly show the existence of large - scale velocity fluctuations , which manifest as `` swirls '' @xcite .",
    "the experiments of nicolai _",
    "_ @xcite and segr _ et al . _",
    "@xcite suggest that while for small containers the velocity fluctuations do indeed grow linearly in @xmath18 , for larger containers the velocity fluctuations saturate ( see however  @xcite ) . the reasons ( if any ) that this should be observed have been the subject of sustained theoretical debate .",
    "it was shown by koch and shaqfeh @xcite that hydrodynamic interactions can be screened if the colloids exhibit certain long - ranged correlations reminiscent of those found for electrostatic systems .",
    "a number of theories have been proposed to generate such correlations in the bulk , including a coupled convective - diffusion model by levine _",
    "_ @xcite that generates a noise - induced phase - transition to a screened phase .",
    "another class of theories focuses on the container walls .",
    "for example hinch @xcite has argued that the bottom of a vessel will act as a sink for fluctuations , a prediction that appears to be confirmed by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "other authors have emphasized the importance of stratification @xcite and polydispersity @xcite .",
    "most of the theoretical studies of sedimentation described above have focused on the non - brownian limit where thermal fluctuations are negligible .",
    "this can be quantified by defining the peclet number ( pe ) @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the equilibrium self - diffusion constant and @xmath21 is the particle s buoyant mass .",
    "the non - brownian limit then corresponds to @xmath22 . because pe scales as @xmath23 ,",
    "the very large pe numbers needed to approximate the non - brownian limit are easily achieved by increasing particle size .    the pe number is directly related to the gravitational length @xmath24 . for this reason , the criterion @xmath25 is often used to define the colloidal regime since , roughly speaking",
    ", one would expect from the barometric law that particles would then be dispersed throughout the solution . for example , for polystyrene spheres in water @xmath26 for @xmath27 m . in experiments ,",
    "the density difference @xmath28 can be adjusted by density matching so that the pe number can also be tuned quite accurately for a given @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast to most previous theoretical and computational studies , which have focused on the non - brownian @xmath29 limit , in this paper we study steady state sedimentation at the moderate pe numbers relevant for the colloidal regime . in this regime the particles experience both ( random ) thermal fluctuations and ( deterministic ) hydrodynamic fluctuations , and a key question will be how these two kinds of fluctuations interact .",
    "we employ stochastic rotation dynamics ( srd ) @xcite to describe the solvent , and a molecular dynamics scheme to propagate the colloids .",
    "such a hybrid technique was first employed by malevanets and kapral @xcite , and recently used to study colloidal sedimentation by ourselves @xcite and by hecht _",
    "_ @xcite . in section [ sec_method ]",
    "we briefly recap the salient details of our simulation method .    in section [ sec_average ]",
    "we study the average sedimentation velocity .",
    "our principle finding is that this follows exactly the same trend with volume fraction @xmath15 as found for the @xmath30 non - brownian limit . in other words ,",
    "the effects of backflow are completely dominated by the hydrodynamic interactions ( hi ) , even when the brownian forces are , on average , much stronger . in sections [ sec_space ] and [ sec_time ] we investigate in some detail the velocity fluctuations @xmath31 .",
    "we find that the thermal and hydrodynamic fluctuations appear to act independently of each other .",
    "their effects are additive , at least in the accessed simulation regime , where the hydrodynamic fluctuations are unscreened .",
    "some of these results have appeared earlier in a short letter @xcite , but here they are treated in much more detail . in section [ sec_diffusion ]",

    "we discuss the importance of thermal fluctuations over hydrodynamic fluctuations .",
    "finally , in section [ sec_conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the time- and length - scale differences between colloidal and solvent particles are enormous : a typical colloid of diameter 1 @xmath32 m will displace on the order of @xmath33 water molecules . clearly , some form of _ coarse - graining _ of the solvent is necessary . in this paper",
    "we use srd to efficiently describe the dynamics of the solvent .",
    "the colloids are coupled to the solvent through explicit interaction potentials .",
    "we have recently performed an extensive validation of this method @xcite .",
    "we will therefore only reproduce the most important conclusions .      in srd , the solvent is represented by a large number @xmath34 of particles of mass @xmath35 .",
    "we will call these _ fluid _ particles , with the caveat that , however tempting , they should not be viewed as some kind of composite particles or clusters made up of the underlying molecular fluid .",
    "the particles are merely a convenient computational device to facilitate the coarse - graining of the fluid properties @xcite .    in the first step ,",
    "the positions and velocities of the fluid particles are propagated by integrating newton s equations of motion .",
    "the forces on the fluid particles are generated by external forces generated by gravity , walls , or colloids .",
    "direct forces between pairs of fluid particles are , however , excluded ; this is the main reason for the efficiency of the method . after propagating the fluid particles for a time @xmath36",
    ", the second step of the algorithm simulates the collisions between fluid particles .",
    "the system is partitioned into cubic cells of volume @xmath37 .",
    "the velocities relative to the center of mass velocity @xmath38 of each separate cell are then rotated : @xmath39 @xmath40 is a rotation matrix which rotates velocities by a fixed angle @xmath41 around a randomly oriented axis .",
    "the aim of the collision step is to transfer momentum between the fluid particles .",
    "the rotation procedure can thus be viewed as a coarse - graining of particle collisions over time and space . because mass , momentum , and energy are conserved locally , the correct ( navier - stokes ) hydrodynamic equations are captured in the continuum limit , _ including _ the effect of thermal noise @xcite .",
    "ihle and kroll @xcite pointed out that at low temperatures or small collision times @xmath36 the transport coefficients of srd show anomalies .",
    "these anomalies are caused by the fact that fluid particles in a given cell can remain in that cell and participate in several collision steps .",
    "they showed that under these circumstances the assumption of molecular chaos and galilean invariance are incorrect .",
    "they also showed how the anomaly can be entirely cured by applying a random shift of the cell coordinates before the collision step .",
    "it is then possible to analytically calculate the shear viscosity of the srd fluid @xcite .",
    "such expressions are very useful because they enable us to efficiently tune the viscosity of the fluid , without the need of trial and error simulations .      in the simulation",
    ", colloidal spheres of mass @xmath42 are propagated through the velocity verlet algorithm @xcite with a time step @xmath43 .",
    "the colloids are embedded in the fluid , and interact with the fluid particles through a repulsive ( weeks - chandler - andersen ) potential : @xmath44 & ( r\\leq 2^{1/6}\\sigma_{cf } ) \\\\      0 & ( r > 2^{1/6}\\sigma_{cf } ) \\end{array } \\right . \\label{eq_phicf}\\ ] ] the colloid - colloid interaction is represented by a similar , but steeper , repulsive potential : @xmath45 & ( r\\leq 2^{1/24}\\sigma_{cc } ) \\\\      0 & ( r > 2^{1/24}\\sigma_{cc } ) \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] the latter potential makes the colloids hard enough to approximate hard spheres , yet smooth enough to enable accurate integration of the equations of motion with a time step @xmath43 close to the collision time interval @xmath36 . because the surface of a colloid is never perfectly smooth",
    ", collisions with fluid particles transfer angular as well as linear momentum .",
    "these interactions may be approximated by stick boundary conditions .",
    "we have studied several implementations of stick boundary conditions for spherical colloids @xcite and derived a version of stochastic boundary conditions which reproduce linear and angular momentum correlation functions that agree with enskog theory for short times and hydrodynamic mode - coupling theory for long times .",
    "nevertheless , in this paper we use the radial interactions described in eq .",
    "( [ eq_phicf ] ) .",
    "these do not transfer angular momentum to a spherical colloid and so induce effective slip boundary conditions . for many of the hydrodynamic effects",
    "we will discuss here the difference with stick boundary conditions is quantitative , not qualitative , and also well understood .",
    "for example , we have confirmed that the flowfield around a single sedimenting sphere decays , to first order , like @xmath46 for a slip boundary sphere @xcite , whereas it decays like @xmath47 for a stick boundary sphere .    to avoid ( uncontrolled ) depletion forces , we routinely choose the colloid - fluid interaction range @xmath48 slightly below half the colloid diameter @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "there is no a - priori reason why the hydrodynamic radius should be exactly half the particle - particle hard - core diameter for a physical system . for charged systems ,",
    "for example , the difference may be substantial .",
    "an additional advantage of this choice is that more fluid particles will fit in the space between two colloids , and consequently lubrication forces will be more accurately represented .",
    "we have confirmed that with our parameters srd resolves the analytically known lubrication forces down to gap widths as small as @xmath50 . the agreement at small distances",
    "is caused also by repetitive collisions of the fluid particles trapped between the two surfaces .",
    "but at some point the lubrication force will break down .",
    "an explicit correction could be applied to correctly resolve these forces for very small distances , as was implemented by nguyen and ladd @xcite for lattice boltzmann dynamics . however , in this paper our choice of @xmath48 is small enough for srd to sufficiently resolve lubrication forces up to the point where the direct colloid - colloid interactions start to dominate @xcite .",
    "many different time scales govern the physics of a colloid of mass @xmath42 embedded in a solvent .",
    "hydrodynamic interactions propagate by momentum diffusion and also by sound .",
    "the sonic time is the time it takes a sound wave to travel the radius of a colloid , @xmath51 , where @xmath52 is the speed of sound .",
    "the kinematic time , on the other hand , is the time it takes momentum to diffuse over the radius of a colloid , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the kinematic viscosity of the solvent . for a colloid of radius @xmath55 m in water , @xmath56 s and",
    "@xmath57 s. the next time scale is the brownian time @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the stokes friction for stick boundary conditions , or @xmath60 for slip boundary conditions .",
    "it measures the time for a colloid to lose memory of its velocity ( see , however , @xcite ) .",
    "the most relevant time scale for brownian motion is the diffusion time @xmath61 , which measures how long it takes for a colloid to diffuse over a distance @xmath4 in the absence of flow . for a colloid of @xmath62 m in water ,",
    "@xmath63 s. when studying sedimentation , the stokes time is the time it takes a single colloid to advect over its own radius , @xmath64 . the stokes time and the diffusion time",
    "are related by the peclet number : @xmath65 .",
    "if @xmath66 , then the colloid moves convectively over a distance much larger than its radius @xmath4 in the time @xmath67 that it diffused over the same distance . for @xmath68",
    ", on the other hand , the opposite is the case , and the main transport mechanism is diffusive .",
    "it is sometimes thought that for low pe numbers hydrodynamic effects can safely be ignored , but this is not always true , as we will show .",
    "in summary , in colloidal suspensions we encounter a range of time scales , ordered like @xmath69 , where @xmath70 may be smaller or larger than @xmath67 depending on pe , and where we have assumed @xmath71 to justify @xmath72 .",
    "the entire range of time scales can span more than 10 orders of magnitude .",
    "thankfully , it is not necessary to exactly reproduce each of the different time scales in order to achieve a correct coarse - graining of colloidal dynamics .",
    "we can `` telescope down '' @xcite the relevant time scales to a hierarchy which is compacted to maximize simulation efficiency , but sufficiently separated to correctly resolve the underlying physical behavior . keeping the relevant time - scales an separated by about an order of magnitude should suffice .",
    "similar arguments can be made for various hydrodynamic numbers .",
    "for example , the re number of sedimenting colloidal particles is normally very low , on the order of @xmath73 or less .",
    "but there is no need to take such a low value since many relative deviations from the zero - re stokes regime scale with re@xmath74 .",
    "exactly how big an error one makes depends on what one is investigating , but for our purposes we will take re @xmath75 as an upper bound .",
    "we have shown @xcite that for the friction on a sphere inertial effects are unimportant up to re @xmath76 .",
    "we note that our upper bound on re also ensures that the time hierarchy condition @xmath77 is fulfilled . in principle pe",
    "can be whatever we like as long as re remains low and the hierarchy is obeyed .    in our simulations",
    "we choose an average number of fluid particles per collision volume equal to @xmath78 , a collision interval @xmath79 ( in units of @xmath80 ) , and a rotation angle @xmath81 , leading to a kinematic viscosity @xmath82 .",
    "we choose a colloidal mass @xmath83 , and interaction parameters @xmath84 , @xmath85 , and @xmath86 .",
    "we have verified that this choice leads to a small relative error in the full velocity field , and that we can quantitatively calculate the the observed friction on a colloid @xcite .",
    "note that this friction is somewhat lower than expected on the basis of a hydrodynamic radius set equal to @xmath87 .",
    "this is due to additional enskog friction effects , where the different contributions to the friction add `` in parallel '' , as explained in ref .",
    "the resulting effective hydrodynamic radius @xmath88 will be used throughout this paper .",
    "the time scales in our simulations are well separated : @xmath89 , @xmath90 , @xmath91 , and @xmath92 .",
    "sedimentation simulations were performed in a periodic box of dimensions @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( approx .",
    "@xmath95 ) , with @xmath96 to 800 colloids .",
    "the number of srd particles was adjusted so that the free volume outside the colloids contained an average of 5 particles per coarse - graining cell volume @xmath37 .",
    "this corresponds to a maximum of @xmath97 srd particles .",
    "a gravitational field @xmath6 , applied to the colloids in the @xmath98 direction , was varied to produce different peclet numbers , ranging from @xmath99 to @xmath100 . at the same time the reynolds numbers ranged from @xmath101 to 0.4 .",
    "note that the absence of a wall at the top and bottom of the simulation box necessitates an additional constraint to keep the center - of - mass of the entire system fixed .",
    "right after the simulations start , the colloidal positions and velocities have not yet acquired their steady - state distributions .",
    "we monitored block averages ( in time ) of the sedimentation velocity and the behavior of sedimentation velocity fluctuations , which will be discussed in the next section .",
    "we verified that there was no drift in these properties after about @xmath102 stokes times @xmath70 , corresponding to sedimentation down the height of about two periodic boxes .",
    "the absence of any drift indicated that the suspensions were now in steady state .",
    "the simulations were subsequently run between 200 @xmath70 for @xmath103 to 30,000 @xmath70 for @xmath104 . to check that our system is large enough",
    ", we performed some runs for 1.5 and 2 times the box size described above , finding no significant changes in our conclusions .    the average sedimentation velocity @xmath105 for different peclet numbers and system sizes as a function of hydrodynamic packing fraction @xmath106 is shown in fig .",
    "the results are normalized by the stokes velocity @xmath2 ( the sedimentation velocity of a single particle in the simulation box ) , resulting in the so - called hindered settling function . at low densities the results are consistent with the result found by batchelor @xcite , while at higher densities they compare well with a number of other forms derived for the @xmath107 limit . in most experiments",
    "the hindered settling function is well described by the semi - empirical richardson - zaki law @xmath108 , with @xmath109 ranging between 4.7 and 6.55 @xcite .",
    "our results fall between these two extremes .",
    "the results compare particularly well with a theoretical prediction by hayakawa and ichiki @xcite , taking higher order hydrodynamic interactions into account .",
    "one might naively expect that the effect of hi becomes weaker for @xmath110 .",
    "taking into account only brownian forces would result in @xmath111 ( because of flux conservation ) , which heavily underestimates backflow effects .",
    "however , we observe that the results for _ all _ peclet numbers @xmath112 lie on the same curve .",
    "we emphasise that these results are normalised by the stokes velocity @xmath2 of a single sphere , which itself decreases with decreasing peclet number .",
    "the important point is that the _ additional _ hindrance caused by hydrodynamic interactions is observed to be unaffected by the actual pe number .",
    "a reason for this could be that the _ average _ sedimentation velocity is determined predominantly by the ( time - averaged ) distribution of distances between the colloids .",
    "if this is so , then the particle motion generated by the external field must not lead to a significant change in the microstructure .",
    "that this is indeed the case is shown in fig .",

    ", small deviations are found for perpendicular ( open circles ) and parallel ( closed circles ) wave vectors , but again the differences are not very large .",
    "here we already note that all of these systems are in the unscreened regime .",
    "we next discuss velocity fluctuations around the average . in colloidal systems",
    "the instantaneous velocity fluctuations @xmath114 are dominated by thermal fluctuations , with a magnitude determined by equipartition : @xmath115 to disentangle the hydrodynamic fluctuations from thermal fluctuations , we describe spatial and temporal correlations in the velocity fluctuations .",
    "the spatial correlation of the @xmath98 component ( parallel to the sedimentation direction ) of the velocity fluctuations can be defined as @xmath116 where @xmath117 represents an average over time and over all colloids .",
    "the distance vector @xmath118 is taken perpendicular to sedimentation , @xmath119 , or parallel to it , @xmath120 .",
    "note that we will not normalize the correlation functions by their initial values .",
    "rather , we will normalize them by values which have a more physical meaning , such as the squared sedimentation velocity @xmath121 , or the thermal fluctuation strength @xmath122 .    in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] we plot @xmath123 , which shows a positive spatial correlation along the direction of flow , and an anti - correlation perpendicular to the flow , very much like that observed in the experiments of nicolai _",

    "[ fig3](a ) shows that at @xmath124 the correlation in the perpendicular direction , @xmath119 , is almost negligible compared with the thermal fluctuation strength @xmath122 , whereas for larger pe , distinct regions of negative amplitude emerge , which grow with increasing pe .",
    "similarly , the inset of fig .  [ fig3](b ) shows correlations in the parallel direction that rapidly increase with pe . for the highest peclet numbers studied ( @xmath125 ) , the amplitudes of these correlations",

    "[ eq_diffusion_pe ] .",
    "the diffusion in the plane perpendicular to gravity is also enhanced by the hydrodynamic fluctuations , similar to eq .",
    "( [ eq_diffusion_pe ] ) , but with a smaller prefactor of 0.004 instead of 0.03 ( not shown ) .",
    "the ratio of hydrodynamic diffusivities , @xmath173 is similar to what is found in the experiments of nicolai _",
    "@xcite for non - brownian spheres .",
    "although our simulations are in the unscreened regime , it is interesting to also consider the hydrodynamic contribution to the diffusion coefficient in the screened regime .",
    "if we apply the experimental fits of segr _ _ et al.__@xcite for @xmath174 and the correlation length @xmath175 , then the simple scaling arguments above suggest that @xmath176 which is _ independent _ of @xmath15 .",
    "the exact pre - factor is hard to determine in the screened regime .",
    "nevertheless , an estimate can be made if we assume that @xmath140 has the same pre - factor in the experiments as we find in our simulations .",
    "for example , if we replace @xmath177,which measures the location of the minimum of the perpendicular correlation functions , with @xmath178 , its value for the screened regime@xcite , then we find @xmath179 pe . for @xmath180 we expect a pre - factor several times larger . in the screened regime",
    "the hydrodynamic contributions to the diffusion should dominate for pe@xmath181 . in practice however , we expect that for many colloidal dispersions effects such as polydispersity@xcite may temper the size of the swirls , and thus reduce the hydrodynamic contribution to diffusion .",
    "up to this point we have focused on steady - state sedimentation by applying periodic boundary conditions and giving the system enough time to overcome transient flow effects .",
    "one may wonder what happens if the particles are confined and are not given enough time to reach steady - state .",
    "very recently , royall _ et al . _",
    "@xcite studied nonequilibrium sedimentation of colloids in a horizontal planar slit , at a peclet number of order 1 , using laser scanning confocal microscopy . among other things , they measured the time evolution of the one - dimensional colloid density profile @xmath182 , where the @xmath98-axis is normal to the horizontal plane .",
    "two cases were considered . in the first case",
    "an initially homogenised sample was allowed to sediment to the bottom of the capillary .",
    "good agreement was found with a dynamical density functional theory ( ddft ) calculation that included a density - dependent mobility function . in the second case they considered an equilibrated sample turned upside down so that the previous sediment suddenly finds itself at the top of the capillary . in this",
    "case sedimentation proceeds in an entirely different fashion .",
    "a strong finger - like inhomogeneity was observed , accompanied by maze - like lateral pattern formation .",
    "inspired by these experiments , we set up a box of size @xmath183 ( @xmath184 ) , with periodic boundaries in the @xmath185 and @xmath186 direction , and with walls at the top and bottom in the @xmath98 direction .",
    "( this corresponds to a height of about @xmath187 , close to the experimental value of @xmath188 . )",
    "we add 6500 colloids @xmath189 ) and apply an external field upwards such that pe = 4 . after reaching the equilibrium distribution , at @xmath190",
    "we suddenly reverse the field , again at pe = 4 .",
    "we observe a maze - like lateral pattern , fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] , which shows striking similarities to the experimental observations  @xcite .",
    "the characteristic length of the maze - like lateral pattern is approximately equal to the height of the slit .",
    "it has been suggested @xcite that there may be a relation between this phenomenon and the swirls observed in steady - state sedimentation , but also that the swirls are reminiscent of a rayleigh - taylor type instability in two layered liquids , with the steep initial density gradient resembling a ( very diffuse ) liquid - liquid interface . with the current data , we can not conclusively determine the origin of this instability .",
    "nevertheless it is gratifying that our simulations produce such similar , and nontrivial , behaviour as the experiments under similar conditions .",
    "this can be viewed as an additional validation of our simulation model .    in fig .",
    "[ fig12 ] we analyse the time evolution of the one - dimensional density profile @xmath182 . the crystal - like layers at the top plate for @xmath191 , disappear and then reappear again at the bottom of the plate .",
    "it would be interesting to compare these results to calculations using ddft .",
    "since the latter technique does not explicitly contain any long - ranged hydrodynamics , one would expect it to have difficulty in reproducing the swirls observed in the simulations and experiments .",
    "nevertheless , because both the initial and final states are constrained by equilibrium statistical mechanics ( for which dft is very accurate ) , the one - body density @xmath182 may not be a very sensitive measure of the more complex dynamics that arise from hydrodynamics .",
    "as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] , the short time velocity fluctuations are dominated by thermal fluctuations at all peclet numbers studied .",
    "the relative strength of the @xmath192 thermal and hydrodynamic velocity fluctuations follows from simple scaling relations . using @xmath193 which follows from the definitions of pe and re , together with eqs .",
    "( [ equipartition ] ) and  ( [ eq : vh ] ) , the following relationship between hydrodynamic and thermal fluctuations emerges : @xmath194 where the simplifying assumption that @xmath195 , with @xmath4 the hydrodynamic rather than the physical radius , was also made .",
    "the numerical pre - factor @xmath41 is small and can be extracted from fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] to be @xmath196 for fluctuations parallel to the flow , and @xmath197 for fluctuations perpendicular to the flow .",
    "the above scaling holds for the unscreened regime ; in the screened regime the ratio of @xmath198 to @xmath199 will be smaller .",
    "consider , for example , the experimental results of segr _ et al .",
    "if we take their fits to the scaling of the parallel fluctuations in the screened regime , together with the estimates @xmath200 and @xmath201 , the scaling becomes : @xmath202 for flows in the parallel direction .",
    "this suggests that this ratio is small in the experiments , from @xmath203 for @xmath204 to @xmath205 for @xmath206 .",
    "so despite the fact that the pe number in these experiments appears to be high , there is no need for an effective gravitational `` temperature '' @xcite to thermalise : at short correlation times the usual thermal fluctuations are still dominant .",
    "however , because the product @xmath207 scales with quite a high power of @xmath4 , as fast as @xmath208 , the ratio @xmath209 will increase rapidly for larger particles and gravitational temperature will become essential for thermalisation .",
    "when comparing parallel and perpendicular components it is important to mention that in numerical works where thermal fluctuations are neglected very strong anisotropies in velocity fluctuations , hydrodynamic relaxation times , and diffusivities are often found .",
    "for example ladd @xcite finds @xmath210 in his lattice boltzmann simulations .",
    "this was attributed to periodic boundary conditions .",
    "however , we also use periodic boundary conditions and find results much closer to experimental results ( a diffusivity ratio of @xmath211 ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that thermal fluctuations reduce the anisotropy .",
    "this could be tested in lattice boltzmann simulations by adding fluctuating stress @xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied the interplay of hydrodynamic and thermal fluctuations using a novel simulation technique .",
    "the two types of fluctuations appear to act independently , at least in the unscreened regime .",
    "we find that hydrodynamic interactions are important for the average sedimentation velocity for peclet numbers as low as 0.08 , whereas thermal fluctuations may remain important up to very large peclet numbers .",
    "neither may be ignored for a significant range of peclet numbers .",
    "we also calculate the hydrodynamic contributions to the diffusion coefficient , and find that with increasing pe number they rapidly become much larger than the equilibrium diffusion coefficient . as an additional test of the method we studied finite sedimentation in a horizontal slit , and found characteristic lateral patterns in agreement with recent experiments .",
