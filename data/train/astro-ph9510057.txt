    "in a universe where structure formation occurs by hierarchical clustering , e.g. in the standard cold dark matter cosmogony ( cdm ) , newly formed galaxy clusters should have complex morphologies with copious amounts of small - scale structure ( i.e. `` substructure '' ) .",
    "if the cluster relaxation time is short ( @xmath5 gyr ) , which is reasonable since the sound crossing and dynamical times are short , then the fraction of clusters which appear unrelaxed at a given epoch will reflect the cluster formation rate at that time .",
    "this rate likely depends upon the cosmological density parameter @xmath2 ( e.g. richstone , loeb , & turner 1992 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; bartelmann , ehlers , & schneider 1993 ; but also see kauffmann & white 1993 ; nakamura , hattori , & mineshige 1995 ) , thus the distribution of cluster morphologies provides a constraint on the density of the universe .    alternatively , if structure formation proceeds by some other means , such as the fragmentation ( top  down ) picture of hot dark matter , cosmic strings , or textures , the morphology of clusters may also provide cosmological constraints . in the top  down scenario , for example , structures which are on the verge of fragmenting into smaller components should exhibit significant substructure .",
    "hence the fraction of unrelaxed structures measures the `` destruction '' rate of these objects and this rate may relate to the underlying cosmology .",
    "implementing the above ideas requires a suitable measure of substructure which relates directly to the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "the degree of virialization is well defined by the shape of the cluster potential : i.e. a spherically symmetric or moderately flattened potential implies a relaxed cluster whereas very distorted isopotential contours imply an unvirialized state ( e.g. , buote & tsai 1995 and buote & canizares 1996 ) .",
    "the potential is characterized by a multipole expansion .",
    "the size of the lowest few terms of the expansion relative to the monopole term gives an indication of the distortions in the potential ; very small scale structure represented by higher order terms in the expansion contributes negligibly to the overall cluster potential .",
    "since three dimensional properties of individual clusters can not be determined from observations , attention must be limited to the projected cluster potential and to its multipoles .",
    "the corresponding loss of information due to projection effects can only be recovered by considering a statistically large sample of clusters .",
    "a measure of substructure based on expansions of the potential was introduced by buote & tsai ( 1995a ; hereafter bta ) .",
    "the two dimensional potential @xmath6 due to material interior to projected radius @xmath7 is expanded , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the azimuthal angle , @xmath10 is the gravitational constant and , @xmath11 in the above , @xmath12 is the projected mass density .",
    "the square of each term on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn.multipole ] ) integrated over the boundary of a circular aperture of radius @xmath13 is given by , @xmath14 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 ^ 2\\label{eqn.power0}\\ ] ] for @xmath17 .",
    "the importance of the term of order @xmath18 relative to the monopole term is given by the ratio @xmath19 ( dubbed a `` power ratio '' ) .",
    "the above formalism implies that @xmath20 is specified by @xmath21 , which can be determined in principle from weak lensing measurements ( e.g. , kaiser & squires 1993 ) .",
    "however , @xmath21 is only available for @xmath22 clusters and is given over relatively small regions of the cluster ( @xmath23 mpc ; squires et al .",
    "1995 and references therein ) .",
    "a more readily available tracer of the distribution of matter must instead be used for statistical analysis .",
    "a possibility is the projected density of galaxies in the cluster .",
    "although previously used to study cluster structure ( e.g. , geller & beers 1982 ; dressler & shectman 1988 ; west & bothun 1990 ) , the method is fundamentally limited by the finite number of galaxies ( @xmath24 ) in each cluster . alternatively , the x  ray surface brightness profile @xmath25 traces the projected x  ray emission measure . for instruments such as the rosat position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ; pfeffermann 1987 )",
    ", this translates into the projected square of the gas density @xmath26 since the emissivity in the specified observing band for clusters is nearly constant . replacing @xmath21 with @xmath25 in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn.mom1 ] ) and ( [ eqn.mom2 ] ) implies that the expansion in eq .",
    "( [ eqn.multipole ] ) will not give precisely the potential @xmath20 , but some related quantity which would still specify the dynamical state of the cluster provided the x  ray emission qualitatively traces the mass distribution ( bta and see below for explicit tests of this relation ) .",
    "the abundance of high quality x - ray imaging data over large regions of observed clusters , especially from rosat , currently makes @xmath25 the most attractive tracer of cluster mass .",
    "buote & tsai ( 1996 ; hereafter btb ) computed power ratios for a sample of 59 clusters observed by the rosat pspc .",
    "the primary purpose of this study was to construct a large data set suitable for statistical studies of cosmology .",
    "however , the data also exhibited several interesting properties and correlations which may have significant implications for cluster evolution .",
    "the expansion coefficients @xmath27 and @xmath28 were computed on fixed apertures of @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 mpc ( we assume @xmath32 for the remainder of this paper ) with the center of the aperture defined by , ( i ) the centroid of the image ( where @xmath33 ) , and ( ii ) the emission peak .",
    "these latter power ratios are denoted @xmath34 to distinguish them from those of case ( i ) .",
    "we compute the power ratios in fixed apertures to enable consistent comparison of structures of the given scale .",
    "this procedure is a key aspect of the power ratios : the scale of substructures being probed is set by the aperture size so that different information is generally provided by power ratios computed in apertures of different sizes ( bta ) .",
    "the set of ratios @xmath19 ( with 1 mpc apertures defined about the centroid ) for @xmath35 , 3 , and 4 define the axes of a three dimensional space in which each cluster occupies a unique position ( we actually use @xmath36 for the axes ) .",
    "those clusters with significant non  axisymmetric structure will generally have larger values of @xmath19 so will occupy the region far removed from the origin of the coordinate system .",
    "conversely , relaxed clusters will congregate around the origin .",
    "btb found that observed clusters of varying morphologies occupied only a restricted region in the space defined by the power ratios , lying basically in a thick straight filament extending outwards from the origin .",
    "the projection of this filament onto the three coordinate planes implies significant correlations among the three power ratios .",
    "in particular , the correlation between @xmath37 and @xmath38 is rather strong and admits a physical interpretation .",
    "recently formed clusters arrive on the correlation line with large values for the power ratios . as structure",
    "is erased by relaxation , the cluster moves down the correlation line towards the origin , finally coming to rest near the origin as a virialized cluster .",
    "of course , clusters can also move upward toward large power ratios if , for example , the cluster accretes or merges with a companion previously outside the aperture being considered . the correlation line ( or indeed the thick filament in the three dimensional space ) is interpreted as the `` evolutionary track '' followed by clusters as they relax and age .",
    "the position along this track specifies a measure of the dynamical state of the cluster and the distribution of clusters along the track provides a measure of the balance of the formation and relaxation rates for the clusters ( see  [ sclow1 ] ) .",
    "this distribution should be sensitive to @xmath2 ( see above ) .    in this paper , we use n  body / hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation in the @xmath1 cdm cosmogony ( navarro , frenk , & white 1995 ; hereafter nfw ) to ( i ) understand the correlations of the observed power ratios and test the evolutionary track interpretation of the correlation line , ( ii ) determine if clusters formed in an @xmath1 cdm cosmogony are similar in structure to real clusters , ( iii ) to assess the cosmological implications of the observed distribution of power ratios , and ( iv ) to study the the evolution of power ratios with redshift in an @xmath1 cdm cosmogony .",
    "the cosmological consequences of substructure have been previously considered by several groups ( e.g. , evrard et al .",
    "1993 , mohr et al .",
    "1995 ; jing et al .",
    "1995 ) using a different set of statistics from the power ratios ( e.g. , centroid shifts , axial ratios , orientation angles , and radial falloff ) . while mohr et al .",
    "indicate that the @xmath1 cdm model is preferred over low @xmath2 models , jing et al .",
    "reach the different conclusion that an @xmath39 , flat model appears to work equally well as the @xmath1 case .",
    "although similar statistics are used , the reasons for the discrepancy are not clear .",
    "some differences are that the apertures over which the statistics are computed are not treated the same way and jing et al . use a hydrostatic model for putting gas into purely dissipationless simulations , whereas mohr et al .",
    "use gas - dynamical simulations .",
    "clearly , an independent set of statistics should be applied to the problem to check previous results .",
    "this is also important , however , because the previously used statistics are not clearly related to the dynamical state of the cluster ( see bta ) , although they do represent a means of quantitatively classifying the structures present .",
    "for example , it is not obvious that centroid shifts and axial ratios admit an interpretation in terms of the evolutionary track discussed above",
    ". the x  ray data used ( _ einstein _ ipc images ) also have inferior spatial resolution and signal - to - noise ratios to the rosat data considered in btb .    in  [ method ]",
    ", we briefly discuss the simulations and our method of analysis .",
    "the results for an aperture of 1 mpc are presented in  [ onempc ] .",
    "the power ratios computed on the dark matter distribution are compared with those for the gas in  [ dark.gas ] .",
    "a discussion and conclusions are given in ",
    "[ disscon ]",
    "the simulations are a combined n  body / sph calculation of 6 clusters with velocity dispersions spanning the typically observed range , @xmath40 .",
    "the initial conditions for the cluster simulation were selected from a large n  body simulation without bias regarding the morphology of the cluster at the present time ( specified by @xmath41 ) .",
    "the baryonic fraction is assumed to be @xmath42 .",
    "cooling is not included in the simulations so structures in the densest regions ( cluster cores ) are not well modeled .",
    "this is , however , not a problem since we never consider scales much smaller than @xmath43 which is in any event roughly the gravitational softening length of the simulations .",
    "see nfw for a detailed description of the simulations .",
    "we simulate observations of each cluster along three orthogonal axes with random orientation .",
    "the x  ray surface brightness is computed ,",
    "@xmath44 \\rho^2 dz,\\ ] ] where @xmath45 is the gas density , @xmath7 and @xmath9 specify the location in the observed plane , and @xmath46 is along the line of sight .",
    "the quantity @xmath47 is the cluster emissivity convolved with the spectral response of the pspc .",
    "although the atomic x  ray emissivity of the gas generally varies with gas temperature , the pspc convolved emissivity is constant to a very good approximation for the clusters considered here ( most cluster gas is hotter than @xmath48 kev where the pspc is most sensitive ; see nra 91-ossa-3 , appendix f , rosat mission description ) .",
    "we take @xmath47 to be strictly constant , and since we consider exclusively ratios of @xmath49 , the exact numerical value of @xmath47 is immaterial .",
    "reasonable amounts of poisson noise and undetected point sources have no effect on the computed @xmath49 ( see bta ) so are not included in constructing the synthetic observations .",
    "the power ratios are computed from @xmath25 for each of the projections and for a variety of redshifts @xmath46 in an aperture of radius 1.0 mpc in order to test the `` evolutionary track '' idea .",
    "although we also compute the power ratios for an aperture size of 0.5 mpc , these results are in every way qualitatively similar to those with the larger aperture so are not presented in this paper .",
    "furthermore , there are too few observed clusters with well determined @xmath19 for an aperture size of 1.5 mpc to be considered .",
    "we note that other choices for @xmath13 are possible : for example , the virial radius as fixed by the temperature of the x  ray emitting gas . as noted in bta , however , there are significant difficulties with this latter approach",
    ". uncertainties in the temperature imply large uncertainties in the determined virial radius .",
    "this potentially masks the information contained in the distributions of power ratios . secondly , typical virial radii are large enough that in many cases there is insufficient available data to accurately compute the power ratios .",
    "we therefore restrict @xmath13 to fixed metric distances .",
    "in this section we describe the morphological evolution of the nfw clusters to examine how the dynamical states of the clusters are indicated in terms of the power ratios , and to test the `` evolutionary track '' interpretation of btb .",
    "the evolution of the largest simulated cluster ( cluster cl1 in the notation of nfw ) is shown in figures [ clus1x ] , [ clus1y ] , and [ clus1z ] .",
    "the sph gas particles are plotted as viewed along the three orthogonal directions @xmath50 , @xmath51 , and @xmath46 . the evolution of the cluster is typical for bottom  up structure formation scenarios . at early times , the cluster is a loose aggregate of small clumps which are growing constantly by accreting surrounding gas ( and dark matter ) . at @xmath52 two of the clumps",
    "merge followed by the final merger event somewhere between @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "the subsequent evolution of the cluster is simply that of a single clump achieving hydrostatic equilibrium while incrementally growing by the slow accretion of adjacent material .",
    "we only show this cluster in detail since the evolution and growth of the other clusters proceeds basically in the same manner as described above , although the morphology at @xmath54 is generally very different from that of cl1 ( see nfw ) .",
    "some of the power ratios computed for this cluster for an aperture size of @xmath55 are shown in figures [ powrat42 ] and [ powrat32 ] .",
    "the heavy solid lines indicate the limited region of @xmath49 space occupied by observed clusters ( hence the observed correlation among the @xmath49 ) .",
    "these are simply made by joining the ends of several of the error bars from figure 4 of btb ; it is only meant to give a rough idea of the observed values of @xmath49 .",
    "we consider each projection in turn to understand variations in the @xmath49 due to both cluster evolution and differing viewing directions .      at the earliest redshift @xmath56",
    ", the cluster viewed along the @xmath50 axis has widely separated clumps .",
    "we define clumps as belonging to the same cluster if they satisfy the following condition .",
    "the surface brightness profile @xmath25 of each clump is circularly averaged about the local peak of @xmath25 to yield a radial profile .",
    "if any point on the annulus which has @xmath25 equal to 1% of the peak value is within 1 mpc of the emission peak of another clump , then those two clumps are considered part of the same cluster . for two given clumps ,",
    "if the previous condition is valid for annuli of either clump , they are considered part of the same cluster .",
    "although more arbitrary than some dynamically motivated condition , this definition allows a consistent comparison of theory to observations provided the latter are subject to the same criteria .",
    "this definition also does not require perhaps dubious dynamical modeling of the cluster .",
    "the 3 major clumps at @xmath56 are considered separate clusters by the above definition , although after subsequent mergers the distinction disappears .",
    "the power ratios shown in the figures are computed for the central clump .",
    "the morphology is `` boxy '' or elongated along the four filaments extending from the clump and there is considerable small scale structure compared to the overall ellipticity of the clump .",
    "this is reasonable considering the clump recently formed out of diffuse matter and is not yet virialized .",
    "corresponding to these properties , the values of @xmath38 and @xmath57 are above average for the amount of @xmath37 present and the clump sits at the upper boundary of the region occupied by observed clusters .",
    "although the @xmath37 value is reminiscent of a cluster like a545 ( see btb ) which is highly elongated , there is considerably more higher order structure than in a545 . by the next redshift @xmath58",
    ", the central clump has relaxed and the higher order non  axisymmetric structures are erased .",
    "all the ratios decrease and the cluster moves into the region of @xmath49 space occupied by virialized , regular clusters such as a2029 . at @xmath59 , the three clumps are still considered separate , however , because they have moved closer together the structures linking the clumps move into the aperture and contribute to an increase in the power ratios .",
    "shortly after @xmath59 , one of the other clumps moves into the aperture of the central clump and the two gradually merge .",
    "the next redshift considered ( @xmath60 ) shows the final stages of this merger .",
    "the cluster morphology implies a large quadrupole moment @xmath37 , but not a large value of @xmath57 .",
    "the latter result occurs because the two clumps in the merger are nearly equal - sized so there is little structure that is symmetric with respect to rotations of angle @xmath61 about the origin ",
    "@xmath62 for bimodals with exactly equal - sized clumps ( bta ) .",
    "note that the evolution of the power ratios in time does not necessarily follow the dashed lines in figures [ powrat42 ] and [ powrat32 ] ; these lines simply emphasize the sequence of circles which capture the cluster structure at a fixed set of redshifts .",
    "for example , the entire merger sequence has been missed because of the discretely spaced coverage of redshifts .",
    "in actuality , the power ratios must become very large and move to the upper right of the power ratio plots when the merging cluster is a bimodal with widely separated clumps .",
    "as the clumps coalesce , the power ratios move back down towards the lower left .",
    "the motion of the cluster in power ratio space is thus more complex than indicated simply by the dotted lines , although we know that the merger time is short because the merger happens between two closely spaced redshifts .",
    "the above merging sequence will be clearly seen below for the @xmath46 projection .    the merger with the last subclump has occurred by @xmath53 .",
    "although the cluster shows remaining morphological signs of the event , it has already relaxed appreciably as is indicated by the smaller power ratios . at @xmath63 the power ratios grow again because of the accretion of small surrounding lumps , for example , the gas in the upper left corner in panel ( e ) of figure [ clus1x ] . the remaining relaxation and continued slow accretion of surrounding material until @xmath54 causes the power ratios to change somewhat but they remain in the region occupied by relaxed clusters .",
    "the same considerations can be applied to the other projections .",
    "several forming clumps are again seen at the earliest redshift when the cluster is viewed down the @xmath51 projection .",
    "the clumps are separate according to our criterion ( see above ) so for now we plot power ratios of the central clump .",
    "this clump is unvirialized as it exhibits substantial small - scale structure .",
    "correspondingly , the values of the higher order power ratios are large in proportion to the value of @xmath37 and the clump sits above the upper boundary of the region occupied by observed clusters in figures [ powrat42 ] and [ powrat32 ] .",
    "the clump quickly relaxes so that by redshift @xmath58 the power ratios correspond to that of a regular cluster . by the next redshift",
    ", the upper clump has moved sufficiently within the aperture of the central clump so that the power ratios become large and the cluster moves to the upper right in the @xmath19 plots .",
    "the `` cluster '' now consists of both the central clump and the upper clump which were initially considered distinct .",
    "this contrasts with cluster properties when viewed down the @xmath50 axis . in that case , the clumps were still sufficiently far apart to be considered separate clusters hence the power ratios were computed for only the central clump .",
    "the relaxation and merger of the bimodal cluster at @xmath59 has occurred by the subsequent redshift . from the @xmath50 projection , we know that although the merger is almost complete , two subclumps are clearly visible ( panel [ f ] of figure [ clus1x ] ) .",
    "the two lumps are along the line of sight when viewed in the @xmath51 direction , hence the power ratios are smaller than in the @xmath50 projection . the merger with the remaining secondary lump is complete by @xmath53 so this final merging sequence is not captured in the plots of @xmath19 .",
    "furthermore , the cluster at @xmath63 appears more relaxed in the @xmath51 direction than in the @xmath50 direction so it has correspondingly smaller power ratios .",
    "the evolution from this time to @xmath54 is again the virialization of the final cluster .    at the earliest redshift in the @xmath46 projection ,",
    "the topmost and central clumps are sufficiently close to be considered a single cluster on which we focus attention .",
    "this is a bimodal cluster with widely separated components of approximately equal size .",
    "the evolution to @xmath52 is simply the relaxation of this bimodal cluster as the two clumps draw closer together and merge . at @xmath52",
    ", the last clump also falls into the aperture and the cluster again becomes a bimodal but with a smaller secondary clump .",
    "the cluster evolves in @xmath19 space by sliding down the correlation line in either the @xmath38 - @xmath37 plane or the @xmath57 - @xmath37 plane , confirming the interpretation of an `` evolutionary track '' followed by clusters . after this time",
    ", the simulated cluster remains in the region occupied by single - component clusters as continues to evolve quasi - statically .",
    "we interpret physically the above detailed descriptions of cluster evolution in the cdm cosmogony as quantified by the power ratios .",
    "unrelaxed single component clusters , such as the simulated cluster at @xmath64 , have significant amounts of smaller scale structure , which manifests itself as large values of the higher order power ratios @xmath38 and @xmath57 relative to @xmath37 .",
    "these clusters appear in the power ratio plots in the upper region or above the area occupied by most observed clusters .",
    "as they virialize , they drop down to the region occupied by relaxed clusters at the lower left hand corner of the @xmath19 plots .",
    "if the clump merges with another relatively massive clump , the cluster then moves to the upper right part of the @xmath19 plots regardless of the individual states of relaxation of the clumps . as the clumps merge , the cluster slides down the correlation line ( which has a finite thickness ; more about this below ) towards the lower left where the power ratios are small .",
    "multiple mergers during the lifetime of a cluster are certainly possible and likely in the cdm cosmogony .",
    "thus the clusters can move up and down the correlation line many times in the course of their lives .",
    "these properties allow us to assess the evolutionary state ( in projection ) of any given cluster based on its location in power ratio space .",
    "for example , unrelaxed single clusters invariably appear in the upper part of the correlation line .",
    "examples of this may include a665 and cygnus - a ( see btb ) .",
    "the evolution of any individual cluster can appear differently depending on viewing direction .",
    "clumps that are truly widely separated ( @xmath65 ) may either appear separated enough to be considered two distinct clusters , or appear closely associated and taken to be a single cluster .",
    "similarly , the merger rate for a given cluster can significantly differ if in one projection the secondary clump is outside the aperture whereas in another it is within the aperture .",
    "thus , in any comparison of simulations to observations a statistically large number of clusters must be averaged over to obviate projection effects . in any case , it is important to select clusters from observations and simulations in a consistent fashion to ensure that each sample is similarly affected by projection effects .",
    "the interpretation of the correlation line in power - ratio space as an evolutionary track , however , applies regardless of the orientation of the cluster .",
    "it is simply a quantitative representation of the evolution of the cluster when viewed in the given direction .",
    "( note that projection effectively smoothes the intrinsic three - dimensional mass distribution of a cluster , hence the power ratios in a given projection provide a lower limit to the true dynamical state .",
    "a cluster is no more virialized than indicated by its power ratios . )",
    "we stress that one of the great assets of the power ratios is the ability to consistently compare the structures and evolutionary states of clusters of very different sizes . for example , the clumps appearing at @xmath56 in the simulation are much less massive than are the final clusters , however , the power ratios allow for a consistent relative comparison of the two clusters because the overall surface brightness does not enter into the ratios @xmath19",
    ".    an intuitive understanding of the evolutionary track may be obtained by considering simple analytic models for galaxy clusters .",
    "figure [ powrat42.fit ] shows the @xmath38@xmath37 plane along with the region occupied by observed clusters .",
    "we plot the power ratios of single component @xmath66 models ( e.g. , cavaliere & fusco  femiano 1976 ) , @xmath67^{-3\\beta + 1/2},\\label{beta.mod}\\ ] ] where in order to incorporate models with constant ellipticity @xmath68 we take @xmath69 assuming @xmath70 is a constant axis ratio .",
    "we expect that an ellipsoidal distribution with high ellipticity will relax to a more spherically symmetric distribution ( assuming rotation and anisotropic pressure are dynamically unimportant for the gas ) . assuming standard values of @xmath71 and @xmath72 ( e.g. , jones & forman 1984 ) , we plot the power ratios assuming @xmath73 .",
    "higher ellipticities correspond to larger power ratios .",
    "the expected evolutionary behavior of a simple model translates into a path in power ratio space very similar to the true evolutionary track for clusters with a slope that is slightly steeper than the track followed by the detailed simulations .    to understand this behavior we consider single - component @xmath66 models with @xmath71 but @xmath74 .",
    "these are indicated by the filled circles in figure [ powrat42.fit ] .",
    "again , the evolution from large to small ellipticities translates into decreasing power ratios along a line that is steeper than the evolutionary track .",
    "the line followed by the model clusters , however , is displaced relative to larger core radius case . a bimodal cluster model composed of",
    "two spherical @xmath66 model components each with @xmath71 and @xmath72 separated by distance @xmath75 evolves along a similar track as @xmath75 decreases ( the open stars of figure [ powrat42.fit ] ) .",
    "although each of the preceding models exhibits the correct qualitative behavior , the detailed slopes are incorrect .",
    "an explanation for this is that clusters likely will not simply become rounder , in the case of a single component cluster , or have unchanging clumps approaching each other in the case of a bimodal cluster .",
    "up to a point , general relaxation tends to concentrate mass distributions as well so that the parameters describing the mass distributions are likely to evolve also . as an illustration ,",
    "consider the path followed in power ratio space if a single @xmath66 model cluster with @xmath71 , @xmath72 , @xmath76 evolves to a cluster with smaller @xmath77 , but also smaller @xmath74 .",
    "this is given by joining the topmost open circle with the topmost filled circle of figure [ powrat42.fit ] .",
    "the slope is a better match to that of the evolutionary track suggesting that indeed cluster evolution is accompanied by specific changes in cluster parameters , such as the core radius and the ellipticity .",
    "this issue is considered in more detail in  [ clusevol.simple ] .",
    "the distribution of clusters along the evolutionary track is determined by the balance between the cluster relaxation and formation rates , and hence isolates the information which likely specifies @xmath2 . in keeping with our phenomenological approach ( see btb ) , we make the following intuitive definitions of these rates guided in part by results from the preceding section .",
    "we consider the `` relaxation rate '' to be defined as the hypothetical rate at which clusters would move down the evolutionary track in isolation ; i.e. when undisturbed by mass accreting from outside the specified aperture .",
    "the `` formation rate '' consists of two components , a `` birth rate '' and `` merger rate '' .",
    "the birth rate is the rate at which clusters first appear on the upper parts of the track immediately after forming out of the background matter .",
    "in contrast , the `` merger rate '' is the rate at which a mature cluster jumps from a lower position to a higher position on the track due to the accretion of mass from outside the specified aperture . if these rates as described in terms of movement along the evolutionary track are in fact physically similar to typical theoretical constructions ( e.g. , richstone et al .",
    "1992 ; lacey & cole 1993 ; bartelmann , ehlers , & schneider 1993 ; kauffmann & white 1993 ; nakamura , hattori , & mineshige 1995 ) , then this would suggest that to probe @xmath2 effectively we should consider the location of clusters in power - ratio space relative to a set of rotated coordinates where one axis lies along the correlation line .    in order to make use of all the information provided by the power ratios , it is also important to consider the distribution along an axis perpendicular to the evolutionary track .",
    "in essence , for a given point on the evolutionary track a cluster lying perpendicularly to the left of the track possesses a larger amount of smaller scale structures ( i.e. excess @xmath57 or @xmath38 ) but a less pronounced aggregate , larger scale structure ( i.e. less @xmath37 ) ; the opposite is true for clusters lying perpendicularly to the right of the track .",
    "hence , the distribution of clusters perpendicular to the evolutionary track is probably not intimately related to the rates of relaxation and formation described above and is thus unlikely to be strongly dependent on @xmath2 .",
    "however , the perpendicular distribution may provide different , yet potentially equally interesting , constraints on the structure of clusters .",
    "for example , the perpendicular distribution would seem to be related to the shape of the power spectrum of initial fluctuations on cluster scales ( if that information is preserved during cluster evolution ) , or to the manner of cluster relaxation ( such as by gravitational / pressure forces ) .",
    "whether such effects are indeed important will require further study ( see buote & xu 1996 ) .",

    "the distribution of the `` best observed '' 31 of these clusters is given by the light solid histogram and that of the simulated clusters by the dashed histogram .",
    "we construct the simulated cluster sample by combining the power ratios of the three projections ( see  [ method ] ) of each of the simulated clusters for the two lowest redshifts considered , @xmath54 and 0.07 , which correspond approximately to those of the observed cluster sample .",
    "this assumes that each projection of a given cluster represents an independent observation for the purposes of statistical analysis , i.e. , each simulated cluster represents the `` average '' cluster of that size and the process of observing is simply viewing that cluster from random angles .",
    "this is standard practice in those cases where small numbers of simulated clusters are available ( e.g. , evrard et al . 1993 , mohr et al . 1995 ) .",
    "we further assume that a given cluster can be considered independent at two different ( but close ) times in its evolution .",
    "although each simulated cluster originates from a single fluctuation in the initial matter distribution , every cluster passes through a similar series of morphological stages during its evolution ( based on the simulations ) .",
    "hence the observation of a number of clusters of the same mass is equivalent to observing one cluster but picking it out at several different stages in its evolution .",

    "this result appears similar to the result of one of the statistics used by mohr et al .",

    "this is supported by the the distribution along the @xmath85 direction which shows an excess of clusters with very large values of @xmath85 .",
    "these properties identify @xmath116 as an epoch where clusters are rapidly forming out of background matter and where the relaxation rate is insufficient to balance the formation rate .",

    "the time around @xmath3 is also identified as the era of rapid cluster formation .",
    "clusters at @xmath109 , however , also show a shift to large @xmath86 , although it is less significant than at high redshift and the shift is into the bin just adjacent to @xmath117",
    ". this may be the result of a statistical fluctuation since there are @xmath118 measurements of the power ratios at @xmath109 .",
    "we could have just picked a particular time which happens to give a @xmath119 fluctuation to larger @xmath86 .",
    "alternatively , the number of clusters with large @xmath57 could really be high at certain redshifts .",

    "however , the distribution shifts towards _ smaller _ @xmath105 at the highest redshifts considered . at first",
    ", this may appear to contradict the picture of cluster evolution outlined above , but it actually provides an interesting additional constraint while highlighting the utility of the dipole power ratio . recall that @xmath105 is large for bimodal clusters with roughly equally sized components but small for elongated single component clusters .",
    "in contrast , the centroided even power ratios are large for both sets of clusters ( bta ) . the small number of large @xmath105 clusters at high @xmath46 and the excess of positive @xmath86 clusters in the @xmath38 ",
    "@xmath37 plane implies that there are many rather unrelaxed single component clusters , but very few large bimodal clusters ; here `` single component '' means an isolated but possibly morphologically complex lump of material .",
    "this is a reasonable situation . at the earliest times",
    ", single lumps are forming out of the background matter distribution . these are unrelaxed",
    "so have large centroided power ratios ; the distribution is skewed towards high @xmath85 and positive @xmath86 . however , the bimodals can only occur after two of these nascent lumps have collided and begun to merge .",
    "this occurs some time after the initial formation of the single lumps .",
    "thus , the epoch around @xmath3 is a the period when virializing single component clusters are rapidly emerging from the background matter . after this time , clusters form primarily by mergers with other lumps ( there are few single lumps emerging from the background since the distribution in @xmath86 is evenly spread between positive and negative values ) and it is this rate which balances the rate of relaxation and results in the constant distribution of clusters along the @xmath85 direction of the power ratio correlations . it is evident that the cluster formation rate is not simply the rate of making bound mass concentrations out of initial density fluctuations , but also involves knowing the merger rate at the given time .      in the @xmath46 projection",
    "the cl1 cluster evolves very nearly along a line in the @xmath38@xmath37 plane with a slope that agrees well with that of the best - fit line to the rosat data .",
    "we consider simple parametrized models of the simulated cluster in order to understand how the cluster adjusts its morphology to follow the evolutionary track displayed by the rosat clusters . at early times , the two components of the bimodal cluster are well separated so can be considered individual clusters for the present purposes .",
    "the surface brightness profile of each component is fitted to the @xmath66 model ( eq . [ beta.mod ] ) assuming circular isophotes @xmath120 . at later times",
    "( @xmath121  panel ( f ) of figure [ clus1z ] ) the merged remnant resembles a rather high ellipticity @xmath66 model and is consequently fitted with finite @xmath68 .",
    "table [ bet.params ] gives the best fit parameters at various redshifts .",
    "consider first the bimodal cluster at @xmath58 and 0.68 .",
    "the top component ( the uppermost clump in figure [ clus1z ] ) evolves little with both @xmath66 and @xmath122 retaining steady and realistic ( e.g. , jones & forman 1984 ) values .",
    "the central clump has a constant @xmath122 but a surface brightness profile which becomes shallower in time .",
    "this simple modification to the naive view that a bimodal cluster evolves only due to the mutual approach of its two unchanging components allows the line followed by the cluster in power ratio space to agree with observations .",
    "specifically , the path indicated by the open stars of figure [ powrat42.fit ] is modified , for example , by allowing @xmath66 for one of the clumps to decrease with time , so that it becomes shallower , in agreement with the distribution of observed clusters . an interesting aspect of this result is that the rate at which @xmath66 changes must be accurately tuned , in concert with the approach speed of the two clumps , so that the corresponding path followed in power ratio space is correct .",
    "the rate of evolution of @xmath66 likely depends primarily on the actions of self gravity in the given subclump .",
    "however , the rate of approach of the subclumps may be controlled or at least influenced by the large scale matter distribution , tidal fields , or the underlying cosmological model .",
    "thus the slope of the correlation line potentially gives information both on the rate of gravitational relaxation and on cosmology , but it will require further simulations to disentangle the various dependences .",
    "a further consequence of the above parameter evolution is that simulations of cluster mergers are only realistic if the approach speed of the two clumps is correctly chosen so that the cluster satisfies the above evolutionary track constraint .",
    "subclumps can not approach each other at arbitrary speeds , otherwise they will evolve into a region of power ratio space where no clusters are observed to reside .",
    "this new restriction is important for many issues which are addressed by simulations .",
    "for example , simulations based on cosmologically motivated initial conditions show that cluster gas relaxes to hydrostatic equilibrium on relatively short time scales ( e.g. , tsai , katz , & bertschinger 1994 , nfw ) .",
    "in contrast , some simulations concentrating on the study of specific mergers indicate that relaxation could take much longer ( e.g. , roettiger , burns , & loken 1993 ; nakamura et al .",
    "however , the subclumps in these studies are allowed to merge at rather high speeds ( a few times the sound speed ) .",
    "it is not clear that the clusters in these simulations would obey the observational constraints described here and thus whether they represent realistic cluster simulations .",
    "the evolutionary track also places constraints on the evolution of single - component clusters .",
    "the simulated cluster at @xmath52 and 0.35 are fit to single @xmath66 models .",
    "( at @xmath52 , two defined emission peaks remain , however , the separation is very small @xmath123 kpc so our single cluster assumption is adequate for the present purposes . )",
    "table [ bet.params ] shows that the evolution in this case consists of the surface brightness profile becoming both shallower and more centrally concentrated .",
    "this modification to the naive view that single clusters evolve simply by becoming rounder is again sufficient to ensure that the cluster follows the required path in power ratio space .",
    "as before , gravitational relaxation likely leads to the required parameter evolution of the cluster , however , external tidal fields could also play a role .",
    "an important assumption underlying our analysis is that the x - ray emission traces the underlying mass sufficiently well to allow the power ratios to quantify the evolutionary state of the underlying mass .",
    "although we expect the distributions to be different in detail even in rather virialized clusters ( e.g , buote & canizares 1996 and references therein ) , a simple qualitative examination of the simulated clusters shows that the gross morphological characteristics of the dark matter and of the gas are similar ( e.g. , buote & tsai 1995b ; nfw ) .",
    "the power ratios allow this connection to be quantified in detail . as an example , figure [ darkmatpowrat ] shows the power ratios computed on a 1 mpc aperture for the dark matter distribution of the largest cluster cl1 .",
    "specifically , @xmath124 is used in eqs .",
    "( [ eqn.mom1 ] ) and ( [ eqn.mom2 ] ) where @xmath125 is the dark matter mass density .",
    "the expansion of eq .",
    "( [ eqn.multipole ] ) in this case will give exactly the projected potential .",
    "the cluster dark matter is distributed much like the gas shown in figures [ clus1x ] , [ clus1y ] , and [ clus1z ] ( see also nfw ) .",
    "concentrations of dark matter coincide with concentrations of gas and the correspondence is retained in the subsequent mergers and evolution of the clumps .",
    "however , after mergers , the distributions of the gas and dark matter differ in that the dark matter retains a larger quadrapole moment than does the gas .",
    "in fact , gas distributed in hydrostatic equilibrium under the influence of an ellipsoidal dark matter halo is rounder than the underlying mass distribution ( buote & canizares 1996 ; buote & tsai 1995b ) .",
    "thus an exact numerical correspondence between the power ratios for the gas and the dark matter is not expected .",
    "the dark matter power ratios will in general be larger both because it dominates the mass , hence is less `` round '' than the gas , and because it evolves less rapidly since non  axisymmetric structures are not erased as readily as in the dissipational gas .",
    "what is important , however , is that the gas and the dark matter give a consistent picture of the state of the cluster .",
    "the figures show that the dark matter power ratios evolve generally like those of the gas , although the values extend over a smaller region of the space , as we expect . at early times , the two clumps which form the nascent cluster are widely separated .",
    "as they approach and merge , the power ratios move down and to the left , although the values remain large compared to that of the gas .",
    "however , the notion of the evolutionary track is clearly valid for the dark matter and the dynamical states as classified by the dark matter and gas are consistent .",
    "note , however , that the track for the dark matter does not seem to coincide with that of the gas . for example , the track in the @xmath38@xmath37 correlation falls below that of the gas at some redshifts .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ reason that the two tracks should be exactly the same ; rather this serves to illustrate that the different aspects of the evolution of the dark matter and gas may be usefully quantified and analyzed by the power ratios .",
    "detailed statistical analyses should provide interesting information on the relative behaviors of dark matter and gas as they evolve simultaneously in the cdm model which has , among others , implications for dynamical estimates of the mass distributions of galaxy clusters using x - rays .",
    "these issues are beyond the scope of the present paper and will be considered elsewhere .",
    "with the aid of hydrodynamical simulations of cluster formation , we have further demonstrated the utility of the power ratios for quantifying the morphology and evolution of galaxy clusters and have shown their promise for providing new constraints on cosmology .",
    "these statistics are dynamically motivated : each power ratio measures the square of a higher order moment of the projected potential relative to the monopole term and hence quantifies the amount of higher order , non  axisymmetric ( for odd moments ) structure present in the projected potential .",
    "the power ratios were computed elsewhere for a sample of low redshift ( @xmath126 ) clusters observed by rosat ( btb ) and displayed interesting correlations .",
    "the observed clusters occupy only a restricted region of the space defined by the three lowest order power ratios ( log @xmath37 , log @xmath57 , log @xmath38 ) , extending in a thick straight filament outward from the origin .",
    "this filament , or any of the correlation lines resulting from projection of the filament onto the coordinate planes , was interpreted in the context of bottom  up cluster formation scenarios as the evolutionary track followed by clusters as they form out of the background distribution ( moving onto the track from above ) , relax ( moving down along the track towards the origin ) , or merge with a clump previously outside the given aperture ( moving outward from the origin along the track ) .",
    "the cluster simulations confirm the above picture of the evolutionary track and show that clusters formed in the standard @xmath1 cdm cosmogony evolve along the same track as given by the data .",
    "in addition , a combination of the simulations and simplified parametric cluster models allow an intuitive understanding of cluster evolution .",
    "a bimodal cluster , for example , would evolve by the mutual approach of the two components .",
    "a simple model consisting of two unchanging components ( taken to be @xmath66 models ) approaching each other follows a straight line in power ratio space that mimics the qualitative aspects of the evolutionary track , but has a steeper slope .",
    "the simulations show that if in addition the components evolve individually by self gravity giving smaller core radii or shallower mass distributions , the slope will agree with that of the observed track .",
    "since the evolution of the components is likely driven mainly by self gravity , the rate of approach of the two clumps must be finely tuned so as to ensure that the cluster moves in an allowed ( i.e. probable ) region of power ratio space .",
    "this approach speed may depend upon the assumed cosmology .",
    "hence the slope of the evolutionary track may constrain the underlying cosmology . a large suite of simulations with many different cosmogonies",
    "must be examined to disentangle the various dependences .",
    "btb asserted that the distribution of rosat clusters along the evolutionary track is a measure of the balance of the formation and relaxation rates of clusters .",
    "guided by the success of the evolutionary track interpretation shown by the simulated clusters , in this paper we explicitly defined these rates in terms of the evolutionary track .",
    "we considered the `` relaxation rate '' to be the hypothetical rate at which clusters would move down the evolutionary track in isolation ; i.e. when undisturbed by mass accreting from outside the specified aperture .",
    "we defined the `` formation rate '' to consist of a `` birth rate '' and `` merger rate '' .",
    "the birth rate is the rate at which clusters first appear on the upper parts of the track immediately after forming out of the background matter while the `` merger rate '' is the rate at which a mature cluster jumps from a lower position to a higher position on the track due to the accretion of mass from outside the specified aperture .",
    "provided these rates have physical meanings similar to conventional definitions , then this would suggest that to probe @xmath2 effectively we should consider the location of clusters in power - ratio space relative to a set of rotated coordinates where one axis lies along the correlation line .",
    "we compared the distribution of simulated clusters along and perpendicular to the evolutionary track with the observed distributions of rosat clusters .",
    "it was therefore useful to consider a rotated coordinate system @xmath84 where @xmath85 coincided with the evolutionary track and @xmath86 was taken to be perpendicular to it .",
    "the simulated cluster sample at low redshift contained too many large @xmath85 clusters relative to the observations .",
    "provided that our assumptions regarding the construction of the simulated cluster sample are not grossly inaccurate ( e.g. , that each simulated cluster represents the `` average '' cluster of that size ) then the @xmath1 cosmogony produces too many clusters with significant substructure .",
    "this latter conclusion is supported by ongoing work on dissipationless simulations where the simulated clusters sample is much more statistically significant ( buote & xu 1996 ) .",
    "note these conclusions differ from previous studies ( e.g. , mohr et al . 1995 ; jing et al .",
    "1995 ) .",
    "since the distribution in the @xmath85 direction results from the combined actions of formation and relaxation , either the formation rate of clusters in the simulations is too high , or the relaxation rate is too low .",
    "since relaxation is treated self - consistently , it is likely that the formation rate with @xmath1 is too high .",
    "@xmath127 cosmogonies are thus preferred , given the arguments of richstone et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and agrees with results from recent cluster dynamical studies ( e.g. , carlberg et al .",
    "1995 ) , over - density of baryons in clusters ( e.g. , white et al .",
    "1993 ; buote & canizares 1996 ) , and galactic disk arguments ( toth & ostriker 1992 ) , but does not agree with analytic treatments of cluster collapse ( e.g. , richstone et al . 1992 ; lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "part of this latter disparity may result from the use of qualitative estimates of the fraction of clusters possessing substructure in place of quantitative statistics employed in the present study and because of the reliance on linear theory results .",
    "the application of power ratios to analytic treatments of cluster collapse may clarify the reasons for the above disagreement as well as elaborating on the @xmath2 dependence of cluster evolution .",
    "these arguments will be presented elsewhere .",
    "it will in any case also be useful to confirm the present results with more statistically complete samples of simulated clusters .",
    "this necessarily implies that we consider purely dissipationless dark matter simulations where the computational demands are tractable ( buote & xu 1996 ) .",
    "the distributions of the simulated and observed rosat clusters agree in the @xmath86 direction ; i.e. perpendicular to the evolutionary track . for a given point on the evolutionary track a cluster lying perpendicularly to the left ( i.e. positive @xmath86 ) of",
    "the track possesses a larger amount of smaller scale structures ( i.e. excess @xmath57 or @xmath38 ) but a less pronounced aggregate , larger scale structure ( i.e. less @xmath37 ) ; the opposite is true for clusters lying perpendicularly to the right ( i.e. negative @xmath86 ) of the track .",
    "intuitively the agreement of the rosat and simulated cluster distributions in @xmath86 implies that for a particular dynamical age ( i.e. at a particular position along the evolutionary track ) simulated clusters in the @xmath1 simulation tend to `` look '' like real clusters . unlike the cluster distributions in the @xmath85 direction , the physical implications of this are unclear at present .",
    "one possibility is that the shape of the power spectrum of initial perturbations has been correctly chosen for the simulations so as to give the observed distribution of structure on various scales inside the cluster .",
    "alternatively , the observed distribution may be simply a general feature of gravitational relaxation .",
    "we can not determine which of the two possibilities is more likely without recourse to simulations with a variety of power spectra ( buote & xu 1996 ) .",
    "however , the study of this interesting aspect of cluster evolution has become possible with the power ratios .",
    "we examined how cluster evolution in the cdm model changes with time and suggested corresponding observational tests of the model .",
    "we found that the distributions of simulated clusters in both the @xmath85 and @xmath86 directions are essentially constant from the present up until a redshift of @xmath128 .",
    "we caution that this result may be uncertain due both to the small number of simulated clusters and because the selection criterion for the clusters at high redshifts was not entirely consistent with that of the observed sample of clusters .",
    "however , if the above results hold , then , when coupled with the assumption that the relaxation rate is nearly constant with redshift , the formation rate ( i.e. birth rate + merger rate , as above ) , is constant over the indicated period of time .    at @xmath129",
    "the clusters in the simulations primarily consist of single unrelaxed concentrations of mass . at later times , however , cluster evolution is dominated by the merger of nearly equal - sized clumps , as previously indicated by other studies ( e.g. lacey & cole 1993 ) .",
    "then at early times clusters consist of single lumps of gas and dark matter forming out of the background distribution . at @xmath130 ,",
    "the merger of the nascent clumps becomes the dominant means of cluster growth .",
    "the rate of mergers appears basically constant from that time onwards to the present  a result unanticipated by analytic studies of cluster evolution ( e.g. , richstone et al .",
    "1992 ) . whether the constancy in the merger rate ( as defined by the power ratios ) is a general feature of hierarchical clustering models , or if the redshift at which mergers begin to dominate cluster evolution changes with model parameters , awaits further study . however , the above results suggest that the era around @xmath131 may have observationally interesting properties which can be considered with the expected high quality data from axaf",
