    "since predictions based on stellar - atmosphere models are useful for _  spectro - photometric dating of stars and galaxies \" _ , main subject of this conference , we present some of the results obtained from an empirically calibrated grid of stellar atmosphere models for simultaneously deriving homogeneous effective temperatures and metallicities of 40 stars from observed data .",
    "we use the basel stellar library ( basel ) photometric calibrations , extensively tested and regularly updated for a larger set of parameters ( see lejeune et al . 1997 , 1998 and lastennet et al .",
    "the basel models cover a large range of fundamental parameters : 2000 k",
    "@xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath3 50,000 k , @xmath01.02 @xmath3",
    "@xmath5 @xmath3 5.5 , and @xmath05.0 @xmath3 [ fe / h ] @xmath3 + 1.0 . this library combines theoretical stellar energy distributions which are based on several original grids of blanketed model atmospheres , and which have been corrected in such a way as to provide synthetic colours consistent with extant empirical calibrations at all wavelengths from the near - uv through the far - ir . for more details and references on the basel library ,",
    "see contributions of lejeune et al . , lastennet et al . and westera et al .",
    "in this volume .",
    "very recently , ribas et al . (",
    "1998 ) have computed the effective temperatures of 19 eclipsing binaries included in the hipparcos catalogue from their radii , hipparcos trigonometric parallaxes , and apparent visual magnitudes corrected for absorption .",
    "they used flower s ( 1996 ) calibration to derive bolometric corrections .",
    "only 8 systems are in common with our working sample .",
    "the comparison with our results is made in table 1 .",
    "the @xmath4 being highly related with metallicity , a direct comparison is not possible because , unlike the hipparcos - derived data , our results are not given in terms of temperatures with error bars , but as ranges of @xmath4 compatible with a given [ fe / h ] .",
    "thus , the ranges reported in tab . 1 are given assuming three different hypotheses : [ fe / h]@xmath60.2 , [ fe / h ] @xmath7 0 , and [ fe / h ] @xmath7 0.2 .",
    "the overall agreement is quite satisfactory , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the disagreement for the temperatures of cw cephei can be explained by the large error of the hipparcos parallax ( @xmath8@xmath9/@xmath10 @xmath1170% ) . for such large errors , the lutz - kelker correction ( lutz & kelker 1973 )",
    "can not be neglected : the average distance is certainly underestimated and , as a consequence , the @xmath4 is also underestimated in ribas et al.s ( 1998 ) calculation .",
    "thus , the agreement with the results obtained from the basel models is certainly better than it would appear in fig . 1 and tab",
    "similar corrections , of slightly lesser extent , are probably also indicated for the @xmath2 of rz cha and gg lup , which have @xmath8@xmath12/@xmath13 10% ( 11.6% and 11.4% , respectively ) .",
    "finally , it is worth noting that the system with the smallest relative error in tab . 1",
    ", @xmath14 aur , shows excellent agreement between @xmath4 ( hipparcos ) and @xmath15 ( basel ) , which underlines the validity of the basel models .",
