    "the @xcite law , @xmath4 relating the 2d ( projected or surface ) density , @xmath5 , and the dimensionless radius , @xmath6 , is often fit to the luminosity profiles of elliptical galaxies and to the bulges of disk galaxies .",
    "the parameters of the fit include the srsic index , @xmath1 , as well as the constant , @xmath7 , which is normally chosen so that @xmath8 is the radius containing one - half of the projected light ; @xmath9 @xcite .    in a recent series of papers , a. graham and co",
    "- workers have shown that the srsic law provides a remarkably good fit to the luminosity profiles of stellar spheroids , from de galaxies to the most luminous ellipticals @xcite .",
    "the fits apply over 2 - 3 decades in radius , and often extend down to the innermost resolvable radius .",
    "deviations from the best - fitting srsic law are typically of order @xmath10 magnitudes rms .",
    "the srsic index @xmath1 is found to correlate well with galaxy absolute magnitude , @xmath11 @xcite , and also with other structural parameters like @xmath8 and @xmath12 @xcite . setting @xmath13 gives the @xcite law , which is a good fit to luminous elliptical galaxies , and @xmath14 is the exponential law , which reproduces well the luminosity profiles of dwarf ellipticals .",
    "there are some known limitations to the applicability of equation ( [ eq : sersic ] ) to the very central regions of some galaxies .",
    "in particular , srsic s law fails to represent adequately the very central profiles of elliptical galaxies with cores ; the pointlike nuclei of some de galaxies ; and the steep power - law density cusps observed in the inner few parsecs of nearby galaxies like m32 and the bulge of the milky way .",
    "the origin of these features is not well understood , but it is likely that they are the result of dynamical processes , possibly involving single or multiple black holes , which act to modify the pre - existing srsic profile in the innermost regions @xcite .",
    "the density profiles of the _ dark matter _",
    "halos formed in @xmath15-body simulations of hierarchical clustering have traditionally been fit to a rather different class of functions , essentially broken power laws @xcite . however , the most recent simulations @xcite suggest that halo density profiles are better represented by a function with a continuously - varying slope . @xcite proposed the fitting function @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radius at which the logarithmic slope of the _ space _ density is @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is a parameter describing the degree of variation of the slope .",
    "the corresponding density profile is @xmath20 with @xmath21 .",
    "remarkably , this is precisely the same functional form as equation ( [ eq : sersic ] )  with the difference that navarro et al .",
    "fit equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) to the _ space _ density of dark matter halos , while equation ( [ eq : sersic ] ) applies to the _ projected _ densities of galaxies .",
    "nevertheless the connection is intriguing and a number of questions spring to mind .",
    "does the srsic profile fit the surface density profiles of dark matter halos as well as it fits galaxies ?",
    "we will show here (  3 ) that the answer is `` yes '' : the same fitting function provides an equally good description of the projected densities of both dark and luminous spheroids . in ",
    "4 we ask whether it is most appropriate to fit the srsic law to the space or projected densities of dark matter halos , and whether these functions are better fits than other three - parameter functions .",
    " 5 contains some speculations about why a single density law should describe dark and luminous systems over such a wide range in mass .",
    "we constructed nonparametric estimates of the space and projected density profiles of the 19 @xmath0cdm halo models in @xcite , and compared them with a number of fitting functions , including the srsic law , equation ( [ eq : sersic ] ) ; the deprojected srsic law @xmath22 , defined as the spherical density law whose spatial projection is @xmath23 ; and a generalized , three - parameter nfw ( 1996 , 1997 ) profile , which may be expressed as @xmath24 with @xmath25 .",
    "the nfw profile has @xmath26 and @xmath27 ; the @xcite profile has a similar functional form with inner slope @xmath28 .",
    "details of the numerical simulations are given in @xcite .",
    "four halos are `` dwarf '' sized ( @xmath29 ) , seven are `` galaxy '' sized ( @xmath30 ) , and eight are `` cluster '' sized ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "we adopt the notation of that paper ( @xmath32= dwarf , @xmath33=galaxy , @xmath34=cluster ) in what follows .",
    "nonparametric estimates of the space and projected density profiles , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , were constructed using the spherically symmetrized kernels defined by @xcite ( see e.g. @xcite , appendix a ) .",
    "each @xmath15-body point was replaced by a kernel of the form @xmath37 with @xmath38 the width of the kernel associated with the @xmath39th particle and @xmath40 the modified bessel function .",
    "the projected radii @xmath41 were obtained from the @xmath15-body radii @xmath42 by assigning each particle a random position on the sphere of radius @xmath42 .",
    "density estimates were computed on a grid of 100 radial points spaced logarithmically from @xmath43 to @xmath44 ( these radii are defined below ) .",
    "we followed standard practice @xcite and first computed a pilot estimate of the density via a nearest - neighbor scheme , then allowed the @xmath38 to vary as a power @xmath45 of this pilot density .    when fitting one of the parametric functions defined above to @xmath46 or @xmath47 , we computed the density estimates on a grid in @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is the geometric mean of the @xmath38 ) to see which choice of kernel parameters minimized the residual of the fit ; typically there was a broad range of @xmath48 values over which the best - fit parameters and their residuals were nearly constant .",
    "the residual was defined as the rms over the radial grid of @xmath50 with @xmath51 the density estimate at grid point @xmath52 and @xmath53 the parametric fitting function ; this is identical to how most observers define the residual .",
    "below we state the rms deviation between the `` measured '' profile and the best - fitting parametric model in terms of magnitudes , denoted by @xmath54 .",
    "we followed the practice in @xcite of only constructing density estimates in the radial range @xmath55 , where @xmath43 is the radius beyond which the halo mass distribution is considered robust to errors or approximations associated with the simulations ( particle softening , relaxation etc . ) and @xmath44 is the virial radius , i.e. the radius within which the mean density contrast is @xmath56 times the critical density .",
    "table 2 of @xcite gives values of @xmath44 and @xmath43 for all halo models .",

    "with few exceptions , modelling of the luminosity profiles of galaxies is done in projected space .",

    "the mean srsic index is @xmath57 ( @xmath32 ) , @xmath58 ( @xmath33 ) , @xmath59 ( @xmath34 ) , possibly indicating a ( weak ) trend toward decreasing curvature ( lower @xmath1 ) in the profiles of halos of increasing mass .",

    "@xcite showed that equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) provides a good fit to the _ spatial _ density profiles of dark halos .",

    "an obvious inference is that a _ deprojected _ srsic law should provide a good fit to the space density .",
    "here we ask which function  equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) , or a deprojected srsic law  gives a better fit to @xmath69 .",
    "we also consider the quality of fit of another three - parameter function , the generalized nfw profile presented in equation ( [ eq : nfw ] ) .    when fitting deprojected srsic profiles to the dark halos , we define @xmath70 to be the srsic index of the projected function ; hence @xmath70 should be close to the index @xmath1 derived when fitting a srsic law to the surface density ( and the two would be equal if the halo s surface density were precisely described by srsic s law ) .",
    "when reporting fits to @xmath69 with equation ( [ eq : alpha ] ) we define @xmath71 , with @xmath19 the shape parameter of equation ( [ eq : drhodr ] ) .",

    "thus , the two srsic functions are almost indistinguishable in terms of their goodness of fit : at least over the radial range available , a deprojected srsic profile with index @xmath75 can be well approximated by a srsic profile with @xmath1 in the range @xmath76 .",
    "both functions provide a significantly better fit to @xmath69 than the generalized nfw profile in the case of the dwarf halos , and the two srsic functions perform at least slightly better than nfw for the galaxy halos .",
    "no single function is preferred when fitting @xmath69 for the cluster halos .",
    "another way to compare the halo density profiles with srsic s law is via the radial dependence of the slope .",
    "figure 3 shows nonparametric estimates of the logarithmic slope , @xmath77 , for the dark halos ; slopes were computed via direct differentiation of the kernel density estimates , using a larger kernel width to compensate for the greater noise generated by the differentiation . equation ( [ eq : drhodr ] )",
    "predicts a straight line on this plot . that is a reasonable description of figure 3 .",
    "the value of @xmath77 in the @xmath33 and @xmath34 halos reaches @xmath78 at the innermost radii , consistent with the asymptotic power - law inner behavior of an nfw profile . no obvious convergence to a power law ( constant logarithmic slope ) is seen in figure 3 , and it is likely that simulations of improved resolultion may lead to even shallower slopes at smaller radii , as pointed out by @xcite .     from @xcite .",

    "figure 4 shows srsic s @xmath1 ( derived from fits to the surface density ) as a function of mass for our dark halos and for a sample of early - type galaxies .",
    "there is overlap at @xmath29 , the mass characteristic of `` dwarf '' halos and giant ellipticals .",
    "however the galaxies exihibit a much wider range of @xmath1 values , extending to @xmath81 in the case of dwarf ellipticals .",
    "a natural interpretation is that @xmath1 is determined by the degree to which ( dissipationless ) merging has dominated the evolution .",
    "the nearly exponential ( @xmath82 ) profiles of de galaxies are similar to those of disk galaxies , suggesting that dissipation played a critical role in their formation .",
    "luminous ellipticals are the end products of many mergers , the most recent of which are likely to have been gas - poor , and have de vaucouleurs - like profiles ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "this view is supported by numerical simulations ( scannapieco & tissera 2002 ; eliche - moral et al . 2005 ) that show how exponential profiles are converted into de vaucouleurs - like profiles via repeated mergers .",
    "a thornier question is : why should a law like srsic s fit dark or luminous spheroids in the first place ?",
    "srsic s law with @xmath84 has an energy distribution that is roughly boltzmann , @xmath85 , and it is sometimes loosely argued that this `` maximum - entropy '' state is a result of the mixing that accompanies violent relaxation or merging @xcite . with regard to dark halos ,",
    "taylor & navarro ( 2001 ) have shown that the dependence of phase - space density on radius is well approximated by a power law whose corresponding inner density profile has the shallowest slope .",
    "this can again be interpreted as an indication that the halos are well mixed . while our study does not shed a great deal of light on this question",
    ", it does suggest that the scale - free property of srsic s law , @xmath86 , is the feature that links dark and luminous spheroids and that this property may be a hallmark of systems that form via gravitational clustering .",
    "we have shown that the fitting function that best describes luminous galaxies , the srsic law , is an equally good fit to dark halos .",
    "we have not shown that the srsic law is a good fit in an _ absolute _ sense to either sort of system . but given that dark and luminous density profiles are not pure power laws , a three - parameter law like srsic s is as parsimonious a description as one can reasonably expect .",
    "future work should explore whether other , three - parameter fitting functions can describe dark and/or luminous systems better than srsic s law .",
