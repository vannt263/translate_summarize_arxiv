    "while the line is mostly evident in the may 2nd , 2003 observation , which we used to derive the best estimate of the line parameters , the considerations presented above strongly suggest that the feature was present also in the other observations , with properties which appear relatively stable over the 12 yr period covered by _ xmm  newton",
    "a careful re - analysis of all available _ xmm  newton _  observations of the isolated neutron star  revealed the presence of a phase - dependent absorption feature at @xmath71ev , which is mostly evident during the decline of the pulse profile ( phases 0.10.3 ) .",
    "the feature was first significantly detected ( at @xmath72 confidence level ) in the may 2nd , 2003 _ xmm  newton _",
    "observation , which was the longest one and was less affected by pile - up .",
    "phase - dependent spectral analysis of the remaining datasets , which cover the period may 2000september 2012 , indicates that the feature is likely present at all epochs and its properties are consistent with being constant over the timespan covered by available observations ( @xmath73 yrs ) .",
    "this suggests that the feature may be long - lasting and not associated to the timing anomalies ( possibly due to a glitch ) which occurred in 2003 ( van kerkwijk et al . 2007 ; hohle et al .",
    "2012b ) .",
    "interestingly , an absorption feature with somewhat similar properties has been discovered in the spectrum of the `` low - field '' magnetar  ( @xmath74 g ; tiengo et al .",
    "2013 ) . in both cases",
    "the feature is present only in a quite narrow phase interval ( @xmath75 of the phase cycle ) , but in  the line energy is higher ( @xmath76 kev ) and strongly variable in phase ( by a factor @xmath17 in one tenth of the phase cycle ) .",
    "no clear variation of the line energy with phase is seen in , although this might simply reflect the fact that the source counts become background dominated at energies just above that of the feature .",
    "tiengo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) interpreted the feature in  as due to proton cyclotron resonant scattering in a baryon - loaded magnetic loop close to the star surface .",
    "the @xmath77-field variation along the loop explains the strong dependence of the line energy with phase , since photons emitted from the surface intersect the loop at different positions .",
    "the similarities between the two features are suggestive that the same mechanism may be at work in .",
    "if the feature is a ( broadened ) proton cyclotron line , its energy is @xmath78 kev , where @xmath79 is the gravitational redshift at the star surface .",
    "the implied magnetic field in the loop is @xmath80 g , a factor of @xmath4 larger than the the equatorial value of the dipole magnetic field at the surface , @xmath81 g .",
    "a preliminary calculation using the same geometrical model as in tiengo et al .",
    "( 2013 ) shows that the energy of the line and its appearance only for @xmath2% of the star period can indeed be reproduced .",
    "it should be noted , however , that the exact geometry of the magnetic structure is likely different in the two sources . in the case of , in fact , x - ray photons come from a quite small , hot spot with size @xmath82 km , while the emitting region of , albeit not uniform , is larger ( @xmath83 km ) .",
    "a further possibility is that the line results from atomic absorption in the neutron star ( magnetized ) atmosphere .",
    "the strong dependence of the feature on the star rotational phase may be due to local inhomogeneities in the star surface magnetic field ( as in the cyclotron scenario above ) and/or to a clumpy structure of the atmosphere itself .",
    "the possibility that primary photons come from a small hot spot appears , on the other hand , unlikely , given the relatively large radiation radius and the broad shape of the pulse profile .",
    "if the feature arises from bound - bound ( or bound - free ) transitions , the atmosphere composition is most probably he or mid - z elements ( see , e.g. , pavlov & bezchastnov 2005 ; mori & ho 2007 ) .",
    "the ionization energy for h is , in fact , below @xmath84 kev for fields @xmath85 ( above this value the feature may be washed out by vacuum resonance mode conversion , e.g. van kerkwijk & kaplan 2007 and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of proton cyclotron lines produced by resonant scattering / absorption in confined , high-@xmath77 structures close to the star surface , where the magnetic field is a factor @xmath86 higher than the dipole , would be supportive of a picture in which the magnetic field of ( highly magnetized ) neutron stars is complex , with substantial deviations from a pure dipole on the small scales . in recent years , a better ( although far from conclusive ) understanding of how stellar magnetic fields are generated and amplified indicates that strong , non - dipolar field components are ubiquitous , from massive stars ( braithwaite & spruit 2005 ) to proto - neutron stars ( obergaulingiler , janka & aloy 2014 ) .",
    "it is now well established that internal toroidal field components , multipolar surface structures , as well as very localized b - field bundles must be present in many neutron stars , especially in highly - magnetized ones .",
    "the recent discovery of sources showing strong magnetic - powered flares and outbursts , but with low dipolar magnetic fields , @xmath87 g , further strengthens this idea ( rea et al .",
    "2010 , 2012 , 2014 ; turolla & esposito 2013 ) .",
    "finally , we stress that the absorption feature reported here for the first time is unlikely related to the broad absorption feature at 270ev ( haberl et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) .",
    "even if the two may have the same physical origin , i.e. a proton cyclotron resonance , the latter implies a lower magnetic field , @xmath88 g , comparable to the spin - down estimate , @xmath89 g , indicating that in this hypothesis it is related to the large - scale field .",
    "actually broad absorption features have been detected in all the xdinss , with the exception of rx j1856.5 - 3754 ( e.g. turolla 2009 ) , but the strong phase variability we observe for the 0.75 kev line of  sets it apart .",
    "this is the first time evidence of a complex magnetic field structure is observed in an xdins , although this result is not unexpected , if , as suggested by many investigations , xdinss are aged magnetars ( vigan et al .",
