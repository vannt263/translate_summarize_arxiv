    "it is also believed to be one of the features that make quantum computers more powerful than classical ones . for spin systems ,",
    "much attention has been dedicated to the problem of thermal entanglement @xcite , i.e. , to quantify entanglement arising in spin chains at thermal equilibrium with an environment or a reservoir . in this approach ,",
    "a thermal distribution of the system energy levels is determined by the environment temperature , but the detailed interaction between the system and environment , and the evolution of the system toward the thermal equilibrium are explicitly ignored .",

    "we consider a two - spin - qubit system interacting with bath spins via a heisenberg _ xy _ interaction . the system and bath are composed of spin-@xmath1 atoms . we restrict ourselves to a star - like configuration with coupling of equal strength , similar to the cases considered in refs .  .",

    "we note here that due to the high symmetry of our model , the coupling to the environment is actually represented by a coupling to a single collective environment spin .",
    "after the holstein - primakoff transformation and in the thermodynamic limit , this collective environment spin is transformed into a single - mode bosonic thermal field .",
    "the effect of this single - mode environment on the dynamics of the two coupled qubits is extremely non - markovian .",

    "this is different from the usual environment models which consist of very large degrees of freedom ( e.g. many bosonic modes ) and often cause the reduced dynamics of the system of interest displaying an exponential decay in time behavior .",

    "the detuning in our model is represented by @xmath28 and it could be controlled by the strength of a locally applied magnetic field , i.e. , the @xmath7 term in eq .",
    "we find that the detuning has a significant effect on the entanglement generation between the two qubits .",
    "we assume the initial density matrix of the total system to be separable , i.e. , @xmath29 .",
    "the density matrix of the spin bath satisfies the boltzmann distribution , that is @xmath30 , where @xmath31 is the partition function , and the boltzmann constant has been set to one . at absolute zero temperature ,",

    "( 14 ) exactly .",
    "however , it is difficult to do so using usual methods , because the treated system and environment could all be strongly coupled mutually and internally . in the following",
    ", we will present a special operator technique to obtain the exact density matrix elements . as shown below",
    ", our treatment is mathematically simple and physically clear , and may be easily extended to more complicated systems with strong coupling .",

    "the time evolutions of the concurrence of the two coupled spin qubits for different initial conditions are evaluated exactly .",
    "the results show that the dynamics of the entanglement strongly depends on the initial state of the system , the coupling between the two spin qubits , the interaction between the qubit system and the environment , the interactions between the constituents of the spin environment , the environmental temperatures , as well as the detuning controlled by a locally applied external magnetic field .",
    "we have also found that if the two coupled spin qubits are initially prepared in the ground state , the entanglement between them will exhibit the `` collapse '' and `` revival '' behavior with time due to the interaction between the two spin qubits and the environment , in analogy to the collapse and revival of the atomic population inversion in quantum optics .",
